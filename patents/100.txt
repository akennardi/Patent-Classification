                                            Field of the Invention
              This invention relates to cytochrome P450s and uses thereof.
                                        Background of the Invention
 [5           Cytochrome P450s encompass a superfamily of oxidases responsible for the oxidation
    of numerous endobiotics and thousands of xenobiotics. In addition, in plants, cytochrome P450s
    play important roles in wound healing, pest resistance, signaling, and anti-microbial and anti
    fungal activity.
              Capsidiol is a bicyclic, dihydroxylated sesquiterpene produced by many Solanaceous
  0 species in response to a variety of environmental stimuli, including exposure to UV (Back et al.,
    Plant Cell. Physiol. 389:899-904, 1998) and infection by microorganisms (Molot et al., Physiol.
    Plant Pathol. 379-389, 1981; Stolle et al., Phytopathology 78:1193-1197, 1988; Keller et al.,
    Planta. 205:467-476, 1998). It is the primary antibiotic or phytoalexin produced in tobacco in
    response to fungal elicitation, and it is derived from the isoprenoid pathway via its hydrocarbon
25  precursor, 5-epi-aristolochene (Figure. 1). Several of the biosynthetic enzymes leading up to 5
    epi-aristolochene formation have been studied (Chappell, Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol.
    Biol. 46:521-547, 1995), especially 5-epi-aristolochene synthase (EAS) (V6geli and Chappell,
    Plant Physiol. 88:1291-1296, 1988; Back and Chappell, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 93:6841
                                                       1

   6845, 1996; Mathis et al., Biochemistry 36:8340-8348, 1997; Starks et al., Science 277:1815
   1820, 1997). EAS commits carbon to sesquiterpene metabolism by catalyzing the cyclization of
   farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) to 5-epi-aristolochene. However, until the present invention, the
   enzyme(s) responsible for the conversion of 5-epi-aristolochene to capsidiol has yet to be fully
 5 identified and characterized.
             Biochemical evidence from previous studies in tobacco (Whitehead et al.,
   Phytochemistry 28:775-779, 1989) and green pepper (Hoshino et al., Phytochemistry 38:609
   613, 1995) have suggested that the oxidation of 5-epi-aristolochene to capsidiol occurs in a two
   step process with one of the hydroxylation steps being constitutive and

                                                   la

   the other being mediated by an elicitor-inducible cytochrome P450 (Figure 1). Because
   1-deoxycapsidiol had been isolated from natural sources (Watson et al., Biochem. Soc.
   Trans. 11:589, 1983), Whitehead et al. (Phytochemistry 28:775-779, 1989), surmised
   that perhaps the biosynthesis of this intermediate was due to pathogen induction of a
 5 corresponding hydroxylase. They therefore prepared synthetic 1-deoxycapsidiol and
   reported a modest conversion of this compound to capsidiol when fed to control or
   unelicited tobacco cell cultures. This was further supported by their observation that
   radiolabeled 5-epi-aristolochene was only converted to capsidiol when fed to elicitor
   induced cell cultures but not control cultures. Whitehead et al. (Phytochemistry 28:775
10 779, 1989) therefore concluded that the 3-hydroxylase, responsible for hydroxylation of
   5-epi-aristolochene at C3 to generate 1-deoxycapsidiol, was pathogen/elicitor inducible,
   while the 1-hydroxylase, responsible for hydroxylating 1-deoxycapsidiol at the C1 to
   generate capsidiol, was constitutive. Hoshino et al. (Phytochemistry 38:609-613, 1995)
   added to the observations of Whitehead et al. (Phytochemistry 28:775-779, 1989) by
15 directly measuring 3-hydroxylase-activity in microsomal preparations of arachidonic
   acid-elicited Capsicum annuum fruits and seedlings. These assays consisted of
   incubating 5-epi-aristolochene with microsome preparations and subsequently
   determining the amount of 1-deoxycapsidiol generated by a combination of thin-layer
   chromatography (TLC) separations and gas chromatography (GC). Their evidence
20 demonstrated that the conversion of 5-epi-aristolochene to 1-deoxycapsidiol was
   dependent on both NADPH and 02, and that 1-deoxycapsidiol accumulation in vitro was
   arrested by the P450 antagonists carbon monoxide (Omura and Sato, J. Biol. Chem.
   239:2370-2378, 1964), ancymidol (Coolbaugh et al., Plant Physiol. 62:571-576, 1978),
   and ketoconazole (Rademacher, Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 51:501-531,
25 2000).
           Recent results suggest that the hydroxylation of 5-epi-aristolochene is an
   important regulated step in capsidiol biosynthesis. In studies to evaluate the
   effectiveness of methyl-jasmonate as an inducer of capsidiol biosynthesis in tobacco cell
   cultures, Mandujano-Chavez et al. (Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 381:285-294, 2000),
30 reported that the modest accumulation of this phytoalexin was accompanied by a strong
   induction of EAS. This result implied that steps before or after the sesquiterpene cyclase
   reaction were limiting. Using an in vivo assay measuring the conversion rate of
   radiolabeled 5-epi-aristolochene to capsidiol, a very limited induction of the hydroxylase
                                                 2

   activities was observed in cells treated with methyl jasmonate relative to that in fungal
   elicitor-treated cells. This result pointed to the hydroxylase reactions as a potentially
   limiting step in capsidiol biosynthesis.

   polypeptides (such as CYP71D20, CYP71D21, CYP73A27, CYP73A28, and CYP92A5,
   and P450s having substantial identity to these polypeptides), as well as isolated nucleic
   acid molecules that encode these P450s.

   including an isolated nucleic acid molecule of the invention and a cell (for example, a
   prokaryotic cell, such as Agrobacterium or . coli, or a eukaryotic cell, such as a
   mammalian, insect, yeast, or plant cell) including the isolated nucleic acid molecule or
   vector.

   ID NO:4 (CYP71D21), SEQ ID NO:6 (CYP73A27), SEQ ID NO:8 (CYP73A28), or
   SEQ ID NO: 12 (CYP92A5), wherein such a nucleic acid molecule encodes a
10 cytochrome P450 polypeptide.
           In another aspect, the invention features a host cell expressing a recombinant
   isoprenoid synthase and a recombinant cytochrome P450. In preferred embodiments,
   the host cell further expresses, independently or in combination, a recombinant
   acetyltransferase, methyltransferase, or fatty acyltransferase. In other preferred
15 embodiments, the host expresses an endogenous or recombinant cytochrome reductase.
   Preferably, the host cell is a yeast cell, a bacterial cell, an insect cell, or a plant cell.
           In a related aspect, the invention features a method for producing an isoprenoid
   compound, the method including the steps of: (a) culturing a cell that expresses a
   recombinant isoprenoid synthase and a recombinant cytochrome P450 under conditions
20 wherein the isoprenoid synthase and the cytochrome P450 are expressed and catalyze
   the formation of an isoprenoid compound not normally produced by the cell; and (b)
   recovering the isoprenoid compound. In preferred embodiments, the host cell further
   expresses a recombinant acetyltransferase, a recombinant methyltransferase, or a
   recombinant fatty acyltransferase. In other preferred embodiments, the host cell
25 expresses an endogenous or recombinant cytochrome reductase. Preferably, the host cell
   is a yeast cell, a bacterial cell, an insect cell, or a plant cell.
           In yet another aspect, the invention features an isoprenoid compound produced
   according to the above-mentioned methods.
           By " P450 polypeptide," "cytochrome P450," or "P450" is meant a polypeptide
30 that contains a heme-binding domain and shows a CO absorption spectra peak at 450 nm
   according to standard methods, for example, those described herein. Such P450s may
   also include, without limitation, hydroxylase activity, dual hydroxylase activity,
                                                     4

   demethylase activity, or oxidase activity. Such enzymatic activities are determined
   using methods well known in the art.
           By "polypeptide" is meant any chain of amino acids, regardless of length or post
   translational modification (for example, glycosylation or phosphorylation).
 5         By "substantially identical" is meant a polypeptide or nucleic acid exhibiting at
   least 80 or 85%, preferably 90%, more preferably 95%, and most preferably 97%, or
   even 98% identity to a reference amino acid sequence (for example, the amino acid
   sequence shown in SEQ ID NOS:1, 3, 5, 7, and 11) or nucleic acid sequence (for
   example, the nucleic acid sequences shown in SEQ ID NOS:2, 4, 6, 8, and 12,
10 respectively). For polypeptides, the length of comparison sequences will generally be at
   least 16 amino acids, preferably at least 20 amino acids, more preferably at least 25
   amino acids, and most preferably 35 amino acids. For nucleic acids, the length of
   comparison sequences will generally be at least 50 nucleotides, preferably at least 60
   nucleotides, more preferably at least 75 nucleotides, and most preferably 110
15 nucleotides.
            Sequence identity is typically measured using sequence analysis software (for
   example, Sequence Analysis Software Package of the Genetics Computer Group,
   University of Wisconsin Biotechnology Center, 1710 University Avenue, Madison, WI
   53705, BLAST, or PILEUP/PRETTYBOX programs). Such software matches identical
20 or similar sequences by assigning degrees of homology to various substitutions,
   deletions, and/or other modifications. Conservative substitutions typically include
   substitutions within the following groups: glycine alanine; valine, isoleucine, leucine;
   aspartic acid, glutamic acid, asparagine, glutamine; serine, threonine; lysine, arginine;
   and phenylalanine, tyrosine.
25          By an "isolated polypeptide" is meant a P450 polypeptide (for example, a
   CYP71D20 (SEQ ID NO: 1), CYP71D21 (SEQ ID NO:3), CYP73A27 (SEQ ID NO:5),
   CYP73A28 (SEQ ID NO:7), or CYP92A5 (SEQ ID NO: 11) polypeptide) that has been
   separated from components that naturally accompany it. Typically, the polypeptide is
   isolated when it is at least 60%, by weight, free from the proteins and naturally
30 occurring organic molecules with which it is naturally associated. Preferably, the
   preparation is at least 75%, more preferably at least 90%, and most preferably at least
   99%, by weight, a P450 polypeptide. An isolated P450 polypeptide may be obtained,
   for example, by extraction from a natural source (for example, a plant cell); by
                                                 5

   expression of a recombinant nucleic acid encoding a P450 polypeptide; or by chemically
   synthesizing the protein. Purity can be measured by any appropriate method, for
   example, column chromatography, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, or by HPLC
   analysis.
 5         By "derived from" or "obtained from" is meant isolated from or having the
   sequence of a naturally-occurring sequence (e.g., cDNA, genomic DNA, synthetic, or
   combination thereof).
           By "isolated nucleic acid molecule" is meant a nucleic acid molecule, e.g., a
   DNA molecule, that is free of the nucleic acid sequence(s) which, in the naturally
10 occurring genome of the organism from which the nucleic acid molecule of the
   invention is derived, flank the nucleic acid molecule. The term therefore includes, for
   example, a recombinant DNA that is incorporated into a vector; into an autonomously
   replicating plasmid or virus; or into the genomic DNA of a prokaryote or eukaryote; or
   that exists as a separate molecule (for example, a cDNA or a genomic or cDNA
15 fragment produced by PCR or restriction endonuclease digestion) independent of other
   sequences. The term "isolated nucleic acid molecule" also includes a recombinant DNA
   which is part of a hybrid gene encoding additional polypeptide sequence.
           By "specifically hybridizes" is meant that a nucleic acid sequence is capable of
   hybridizing to a DNA sequence at least under low stringency conditions, and preferably
20 under high stringency conditions. For example, high stringency conditions may include
   hybridization at approximately 42'C in about 50% formamide, 0.1 mg/ml sheared
   salmon sperm DNA, 1% SDS, 2X SSC, 10% Dextran sulfate, a first wash at
   approximately 65'C in about 2X SSC, 1% SDS, followed by a second wash at
   approximately 65*C in about 0. 1X SSC. Alternatively high stringency conditions may
25 include hybridization at approximately 42'C in about 50% formamide, 0.1 mg/ml
   sheared salmon sperm DNA, 0.5% SDS, 5X SSPE, 1X Denhardt's, followed by two
   washes at room temperature in 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS, and two washes at between 55-60'C
   in 0.2X SSC, 0.1% SDS. Reducing the stringency of the hybridization conditions may
   involve lowering the wash temperature and/or washing at a higher concentration of salt.
30 For example, low stringency conditions may include washing in 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at
   40 0 C.
                                                 6

             By "transformed cell" is meant a cell into which (or into an ancestor of which)
   has been introduced, by means of recombinant DNA techniques, a DNA molecule
   encoding (as used herein) a P450 polypeptide.
             By "positioned for expression" is meant that the DNA molecule is positioned
 5 adjacent to a DNA sequence which directs transcription and translation of the sequence
   (i.e., facilitates the production of, for example, a P450 polypeptide, a recombinant
   protein, or an RNA molecule).
             By "reporter gene" is meant a gene whose expression may be assayed; such
   genes include, without limitation, beta-glucuronidase (GUS), luciferase,
10 chloramphenicol transacetylase (CAT), green fluorescent protein (GFP), beta
   galactosidase, herbicide resistant genes, and antibiotic resistance genes.
             By "expression control region" is meant any minimal sequence sufficient to
   direct transcription. Included in the invention are promoter elements that are sufficient
   to render promoter-dependent gene expression controllable for cell-, tissue-, or organ
15 specific gene expression, or elements that are inducible by external signals or agents (for
   example, light-, pathogen-, wound-, stress-, or hormone-inducible elements or chemical
   inducers such as salicylic acid (SA) or 2,2-dichloro isonicotinic acid (1NA)); such
   elements may be located in the 5' or 3' regions of the native gene or engineered into a
   transgene construct.
20           By "operably linked" is meant that a gene and a regulatory sequence(s) are
   connected in such a way as to permit gene expression when the appropriate molecules
   (for example, transcriptional activator proteins) are bound to the regulatory sequence(s).
             By "plant cell" is meant any self-propagating cell bounded by a semi-permeable
   membrane and typically is one containing a plastid. Such a cell also requires a cell wall
25 if further propagation is desired. Plant cell, as used herein includes, without limitation,
   algae, cyanobacteria, seeds, suspension cultures, embryos, meristematic regions, callus
   tissue, leaves, roots, shoots, gametophytes, sporophytes, pollen, and microspores.
             By "plant component" is meant a part, segment, or organ obtained from an intact
   plant or plant cell. Exemplary plant components include, without limitation, somatic
30 embryos, leaves, stems, roots, flowers, tendrils, fruits, scions, and rootstocks.
             By "transgene" is meant any piece of DNA which is inserted by artifice into a
   cell and typically becomes part of the genome, for example, the nuclear or plastidic
   genome, of the organism which develops from that cell. Such a transgene may include a
                                                  7

   gene which is partly or entirely heterologous (i.e., foreign) to the transgenic organism, or
   may represent a gene homologous to an endogenous gene of the organism.
           By "transgenic" is meant any cell which includes a DNA sequence which is
   inserted by artifice into a cell and becomes part of the genome of the organism which
 5 develops from that cell. As used herein, the transgenic organisms are generally
   transgenic plants and the DNA (transgene) is inserted by artifice into the nuclear or
   plastidic genome. A transgenic plant according to the invention may contain one or
   more engineered traits.
           By "pathogen" is meant an organism whose infection of viable plant tissue elicits
10 a disease response in the plant tissue. Such pathogens include, without limitation,
   bacteria, mycoplasmas, fungi, insects, nematodes, viruses, and viroids. Plant diseases
   caused by these pathogens are described in Chapters 11-16 of Agrios, Plant Pathology,
   3rd ed., Academic Press, Inc., New York, 1988.
           By "increased level of resistance" is meant a greater level of resistance to a
15 disease-causing pathogen in a transgenic plant (or cell or seed thereof) of the invention
   than the level of resistance relative to a control plant (for example, a non-transgenic
   plant). In preferred embodiments, the level of resistance in a transgenic plant of the
   invention is at least 20% (and preferably 30% or 40%) greater than the resistance of a
   control plant. In other preferred embodiments, the level of resistance to a disease
20 causing pathogen is 50% greater, 60% greater, and more preferably even 75% or 90%
   greater than a control plant; with up to 100% above the level of resistance as compared
   to a control plant being most preferred. The level of resistance is measured using
   conventional methods. For example, the level of resistance to a pathogen may be
   determined by comparing physical features and characteristics (for example, plant height
25 and weight, or by comparing disease symptoms, for example, delayed lesion
   development, reduced lesion size, leaf wilting and curling, water-soaked spots, and
   discoloration of cells) of transgenic plants.
           By "purified antibody" is meant antibody which is at least 60%, by weight, free
   from proteins and naturally-occurring organic molecules with which it is naturally
30 associated. Preferably, the preparation is at least 75%, more preferably 90%, and most
   preferably at least 99%, by weight, antibody, for example, an acquired resistance
   polypeptide-specific antibody. A purified P450 antibody may be obtained, for example,
                                                  8

   by affinity chromatography using a recombinantly-produced P450 polypeptide and
   standard techniques.
            By "specifically binds" is meant an antibody which recognizes and binds a P450
   protein but which does not substantially recognize and bind other molecules in a sample,
 5 for example, a biological sample, which naturally includes a P450 protein such as
   CYP71D20, CYP71D21, CYP73A27, CYP73A28, or CYP92A5.
             Other features and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the
   following description of the preferred embodiments thereof, and from the claims.
10                                    Brief Description of the Drawings
            Figure 1 is a schematic diagram of a proposed alternative pathway for the
   biosynthesis of capsidiol in elicitor-treated Nicotiana tabacum cells. 5-epi-aristolochene
   is synthesized from FPP by the action of a sequiterpene cyclase, 5-epi-aristolochene
   synthase (EAS), and is subsequently hydroxylated at Cl and C3 to form capsidiol.
15          Figure 2 is a graph showing an induction time course for sesquiterpene cyclase
   enzyme activity and sesquiterpene hydroxylase activity in cellulase-treated cell cultures.
   Sesquiterpene cyclase (5-epi-aristolochene synthase, EAS) enzyme activity was
   determined in extracts prepared from control (open squares) and elicitor-treated (closed
   squares) cells collected at the indicated time points. Sesquiterpene hydroxylase activity
20 was determined using an indirect assay for control (open circles) and elicitor-treated
   (closed circles) cells. Cell cultures were incubated with [3H]-5-epi-aristolochene for 3
   hours ending at the indicated time points before quantifying the incorporation of
   radioactivity into extracellular capsidiol, a dihydroxylated form of aristolochene
   (Mandujano-Chivez et al., Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 381:285-294, 2000).
25          Figure 3 is a series of graphs showing the dose dependent inhibition of 5-epi
   aristolochene hydroxylase activity by ancymidol and ketoconazole. Cell cultures were

                                           Detailed Description
             Capsidiol is a bicyclic, dihydroxylated sesquiterpene produced by several Solanaceous
    species in response to a variety of environmental stimuli. It is the primary antimicrobial
    compound produced by Nicotiana tabacum in response to fungal elicitation, and it is formed via
 !0 the isoprenoid pathway from 5-epi-aristolochene. Much of the biosynthetic pathway for the
    formation of this compound has been elucidated, except for the enzyme(s) responsible for the
    conversion of the allylic sesquiterpene 5-epi-aristolochene to its dihydroxylated form, capsidiol.
             Accordingly, an in vivo assay for 5-epi-aristolochene hydroxylase-activity was
    developed and used to demonstrate a dose dependent inhibition of activity by ancymidol and
25  ketoconazole, two well-characterized inhibitors of cytochrome P450 enzymes. Using
    degenerate oligonucleotide primers designed to the well-conserved domains found within most
    P450 enzymes, including the heme binding domain, cDNA fragments representing four distinct
    P450 families (CYP71, CYP73, CYP82, and CYP92) were amplified from a cDNA library
    prepared against mRNA from elicitor-treated cells using PCR. The PCR fragments were
30  subsequently used to isolate full-length cDNAs
                                                     11

   (CYP71D20 (SEQ ID NO: 2) and D21 (SEQ ID NO: 4), CYP73A27 (SEQ ID NO: 6)
   and A28 (SEQ ID NO: 8), CYP82EI (SEQ ID NO: 10), and CYP92A5 (SEQ ID NO:
   12)), and these in turn were used to demonstrate that the corresponding mRNAs were all
   induced in elicitor-treated cells, albeit with different induction patterns.
 5          There now follows a description of the cloning of several P450s from Nicotiana
   tabacum. These examples are provided for the purpose of illustrating the invention, and
   are not to be considered as limiting.
   Inhibition of the 5-epi-aristolochene to capsidiol conversion by P450 antagonists
10          Using an indirect assay, a detailed induction time course of 5EAH activity in
   elicitor-induced cell cultures was determined relative to that of EAS activity (Figure 2),
   the well-characterized sesquiterpene cyclase activity that catalyzes the formation of 5
   epi-aristolochene from FPP (Figure 1). Using assays for EAS and 5EAH, EAS activity
   is not detectable in control cell cultures, but is induced significantly within 3 hours and
15 reaches its maximal level within 15 to 18 hours of elicitor-treatment. Similar to the EAS
   enzyme activity, 5EAH activity was negligible in control cell cultures. Nonetheless,
   after an apparent lag phase of 8 hours, a rapid induction of hydroxylase activity was
   observed 10 to 15 hours post elicitor addition to the cell cultures, reaching a maximum
   by 18 hours followed by a rather gradual decline of 10 to 20% over the next 8 hours.
20          Tobacco cell suspension cultures treated with cellulase plus varying
   concentrations of ancymidol or ketoconazole were pre-incubated for 12 hours before
   measuring the cells' ability to convert exogenous supplied [3H] labeled 5-epi
   aristolochene to radiolabeled capsidiol during a subsequent 3 hour incubation period
   (Figure 3). Apparent activity of 5EAH was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner with
25 approximately 50% inhibition by either 25 jiM ancymidol or ketoconazole, and more
   than 80% by 75 pM ancymidol and 95% by 100 pM ketoconazole (Figure 3A and B).
   Importantly, neither the in vitro activity of recombinant EAS nor the induction of EAS
   in the elicitor-treated cell cultures was significantly affected by ancymidol at
   concentrations as high as 100 jM (Figure 3A). Ketoconazole also does not appear to
30 affect the in vitro activity of EAS. However, the inducibility of cyclase activity in
   elicitor-treated cell extracts was inhibited by ketoconazole at concentrations above 50
   stM (Figure   3B). Therefore, the specificity of ketoconazole as an inhibitor of P450 type
                                                  12

  reactions should be assessed at or below a concentration of 50 pM under these experimental
  conditions.
  Isolation of elicitor-inducible cytochrome P450 cDNAs
5         A two-step approach for the isolation of candidate P450 cDNAs was followed. A PCR
  strategy was first employed using a directional cDNA library prepared against mRNA isolated
  from elicitor-induced cells as the template and degenerate PCR primers (Figures 4A-4C).
  Sequence alignments of cytochrome P450s from multiple families across kingdoms were used to
  identify conserved regions to which a series of degenerate primers were prepared (FIGS. 4A and
0 4B). In cloning experiments, 450 to 550 bp products were expected from reactions utilizing the
  primer prepared to the heme-binding domain (GRRXCP(A/G)) (SEQ ID NOS:27 and 28) and
  the T7 vector primer (Figure 4C). The mixtures of reaction products were shotgun cloned, and
  approximately 100 of the cloned PCR fragments were sequenced. About half of the sequenced
  DNAs contained signature sequences typical of P450 enzymes as revealed by BlastX database
5 searches, and these corresponded to typical plant P450 family members of the CYP71, CYP73,
  CYP92, and CYP82 classes. Each of these PCR fragments was isolated multiple times in
  separate experiments. In addition, we isolated full-length cDNAs for these P450 family
  members. Table 1 compares the similarity and identity of the full length cDNAs of P450 family
  members with those of their nearest family member in the GenBank database. In addition,
0 Figures 8A-8D show an amino acid alignment of several terpene cytochrome P450s. Alignments
  were performed using the algorithm of the MACVECTOR software suite.

         The cloned fragments were used in a second step to isolate full-length clones from
    the cDNA library. Screening the cDNA library by hybridization with the CYP71 and
 5  CYP73 gene fragments yielded four full-length cDNAs, two CYP7lDs and two
    CYP73As. The former clones were designated CYP71D20 and CYP71D21, and the
    latter were designated CYP73A27 and CYP73A28. The other two cDNA fragments
    corresponded to tobacco cDNAs already found in the GenBank database, CYP82El and
    CYP92A3. These two cDNAs were cloned using specific primers designed with the
10  help of the available sequence information to amplify the full-length cDNA
    Induction of cytochrome P450 mRNAs in elicitor-treated cells
            To correlate a biochemical role for P450s in sesquiterpene metabolism, RNA
    blot analyses were used to determine the steady-state levels of the mRNAs coding for all
15  four of the cytochrome P450 clones and EAS in control and elicitor-treated cells (Figure
    5). The mRNAs for all four of the P450s were rapidly and transiently induced with
    slightly different time courses relative to one another and to the EAS mRNA.
    CYP73A27 mRNA, for instance, displayed an induction pattern similar to that of EAS
                                                  14

   with the maximum mRNA level occurring 9 to 12 hours after elicitation. While the EAS
   mRNA remained high throughout the duration of the experiment, the CYP73A27
   mRNA was negligible in cells 24 hours after elicitor-treatment. In contrast, the
   CYP7 1D mRNA was more rapidly induced than the EAS mRNA, reached its maximum
 5 6 to 9 hours after elicitation, and was declining by 12 hours when the EAS mRNA level
   was still very high.
   Functional identification of CYP71D20 as 5-epi-aristolochene hydroxylase
           To ascribe functional identity to the various P450 cDNAs, full-length cDNAs for
10 CYP71D20, CYP82E1 and CYP92A5 were inserted into the yeast expression vector
   pYeDP60 (Urban et al., Biochimie 72:463-472, 1990; Pompon et al., Methods Enzymol.
   272:51-64, 1996) and the expression of each in WAT1 1, a yeast line containing an
   integrated Arabidopsis thaliana cytochrome reductase gene (Pompon et al., Methods
   Enzymol. 272:51-64, 1996; Urban et al., J. Biol. Chem. 272:19176-19186, 1997), was
15 determined. Engineering the CYP73A27 cDNA required an extra modification because
   of an unusually long N-terminus with several hydrophilic residues that may interfere
   with proper intracellular targeting (Nedelkina et al., Plant Mol. Biol. 39:1079-1090,
   1999). This unusual leader sequence therefore was replaced with the membrane
   anchoring sequence of CYP73A1, a cinnamate 4-hydroxylase previously demonstrated
20 to express well in yeast (Fahrendorf and Dixon, Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 305:509-515,
   1993; Pompon et al., Methods Enzymol. 272:51-64, 1996). Expression of all these
   cDNAs was under the control of the glucose-repressible, galactose-inducible GAL10
   CYCI promoter (Guarente et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 79:7410-7414, 1982),
   and expression was compared to yeast transformed with the parent pYeDP60 vector
25 (control) alone.
           After induction with galactose for approximately 16 hours, control cells and cells
   containing the various P450 constructs were collected, and microsomes prepared from
   each were analyzed for general P450 expression by CO-difference spectroscopy (Omura
   and Sato, J. Biol. Chem. 239:2370-2378, 1964). Microsomes prepared from cells
30 containing the CYP71D20 (Figure 6A) and CYP92A5 (Figure 6B) constructs both
   showed characteristic CO difference spectra with peaks at 450 nm, indicating that the
   encoded proteins were assembling properly with their heme cofactor. Using the
   extinction coefficient of 91 mM-*cm-1 for heme binding proteins (Omura and Sato, J.
                                                 15

   Biol. Chem. 239:2370-2378, 1964), it was determined that approximately 107 pmol of
   CYP71D20 and 268 pmol of CYP92A5 were expressed in the yeast cells per milligram
   of total yeast protein.
            Both 5-epi-aristolochene and 1-deoxycapsidiol were metabolized to only one
 5 product with the same retention time as capsidiol. Obvious by its absence, no reaction
   product having a retention time similar to deoxycapsidiol was detectable in the 5-epi
   aristolochene incubations (Figure 7). Co-injection of authentic capsidiol with the
   respective reaction products resulted in a single GC peak having a 16.2 minute retention
   time, identical to capsidiol. Mass spectra patterns for the separate reaction products
10 were identical to that for the capsidiol standard (EIMS m/z 236, 221, 203, 185, 175, 163,
   157, 133, 121, 107, 93, 79, 67, 55, 43, 41).
            The in vivo assay data presented in Figures 2 and 3 of the current work indicate
   that the conversion of 5-epi-aristolochene is catalyzed by at least one inducible
   cytochrome P450 mediated reaction.
15          Furthermore, any of the cytochrome p450 polypeptides described herein may
   include one or more hydroxylase activities which can incorporate hydroxyl groups into
   at least two distant sites on an isoprenoid compound. The addition of these hydroxyl
   groups may occur, for example, sequentially, by adding a hydroxyl group first to one site
   and then the other, in either order. Moreover, such hydroxylases may be mutated to
20 limit their ability to hydroxylate a substrate at only one site, or, alternatively, to provide
   stereochemical specificity to their hydroxylating activity.
            The above-described experiments were performed using the following materials
   and methods.
25 Chemicals
            Standard laboratory reagents were purchased from Becton Dickinson
   Microbiology Systems (Sparks, MD), FisherBiotech (Fair Lawn, NJ) and Sigma
   Chemical Company (St. Louis, MO).
30 Biological materials and induction treatments
            Nicotiana tabacum cv. KY14 plants and cell suspension cultures were used. Cell
   suspension cultures were maintained in modified Murashige-Skoog (V6geli and
   Chappell, Plant Physiol. 88:1291-1296, 1988). Cultures in their rapid phase of growth
                                                  16

   (3 days old) were used for all experiments. At the indicated times, cells were collected
   and separated from media by vacuum filtration and stored at -80'C.
            Induction treatments were performed by the addition of the fungal elicitors,
   cellulase (Trichoderma viride, Type RS, Onozuka) or paraciticein (O'Donohue et al.,
 5 Plant Mol. Biol. 27:577-586, 1995) at the indicated concentrations. Paraciticein was
   purified from E. coli cells overexpressing a recombinant paraciticein protein containing
   a carboxy-terminal histidine purification tag.
   In vivo 5-epi-aristolochene hydroxylase assay and inhibition studies
10            5-epi-aristolochene hydroxylase-activity was measured as the incorporation of
                                                                            3
   [ 3H]-5-epi-aristolochene into extracellular capsidiol by intact cells. [ H]-5-epi
   aristolochene was produced by incubating an excess of [1- 3H] farnesyl diphosphate (1
   pM, 20.5 Ci/mmol) with recombinant 5-epi-aristolochene synthase (Back et al., Arch.
   Biochem. Biophys. 315:527-532, 1994; Rising et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 122:1861-1866,
15 2000). The hexane extractable radioactivity from reactions was treated with a small
   amount of silica to remove any farnesol or residual FPP before quantifying the yield of
   radioactive 5-epi-aristolochene by liquid scintillation counting. The hexane solvent was
   removed under a gentle stream of N 2 gas, and the dried residue was re-dissolved in
   acetone. Control and elicitor-treated cells were then incubated with [3H]-5-epi
20 aristolochene (approximately 100,000 dpm at 2.5 nM) for 3 hour periods at various
   points during an induction time course before collecting the cell and media samples.
   Detection and quantification of capsidiol in the extracellular culture media was
   performed as reported previously (Chappell et al., Phytochemistry 26:2259-2260, 1987),
   and the amount of radioactivity incorporated into capsidiol was determined. For these
25 determinations, samples were separated by TLC, and the zones corresponding to
   capsidiol were scraped from the plate for scintillation counting.
            Inhibition studies were performed by the addition of the P450 inhibitors
   ancymidol (Coolbaugh et al., Plant Physiol. 62:571-576, 1978; Hoshino et al.,
   Phytochemistry 38:609-613, 1995) and ketoconazole (Hoshino et al., Phytochemistry
30 38:609-613, 1995; Rademacher, Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 51:501-531,
   2000) directly to the cell cultures or enzyme assay mix. Cell cultures were incubated in
   the presence of cellulase (0.5 gg/ml) and indicated concentrations of ancymidol or
   ketoconazole for 12 hours prior to the addition of [3 H]-5-epi-aristolochene. After a
                                                 17

   further 3 hour incubation period, the cells and media were collected. The amount of
   radioactivity incorporated into extracellular capsidiol was determined as described
   above. To evaluate secondary effects of these inhibitors, the level of inducible
   sesquiterpene cyclase activity in the collected cells was determined according to (V6geli
 5 et al., Plant Physiol. 93:182-187, 1990), as well as in vitro assays with purified
   recombinant EAS (Back et al., Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 315:527-532, 1994) incubated
   with the indicated concentrations of ancymidol and ketoconazole.
            All experiments were replicated in several independent trials. While the absolute
   values presented may have varied between experiments by as much as 50%, the trends
10 and time courses were consistent throughout.
   Construction of an elicitor-induced cDNA library
            Cell cultures were incubated with fungal elicitor (0.5 ig cellulase/ml) for 6 hours
   before collecting the cells by filtration. The cells were kept frozen at -800C until total
15 RNA was extracted from them using Trizol (Life Technologies, Rockville, MD)
   according to the manufacturer's instructions. Poly. (A)+ RNA was purified by two
   rounds of oligo (dT) cellulose column chromatography (Life Technologies, Rockville,
   MD). cDNA synthesis and library construction were subsequently carried out using the
    JNI-ZAP XR library kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), according to manufacturer's
20 instructions.
   PCR cloning strategy
               Cytochrome P450 cDNA fragments were amplified from the elicitor-induced
   cDNA library using various combinations of degenerate forward and reverse primers
25 with the vector-specific T3 and T7 primers. The template DNA was prepared from a
   500 1A   aliquot of the elicitor-induced cDNA library (3 x 106 pfu/ [) by heat denaturation
   at 70*C for 10 minutes, followed by phenol/chloroform extraction, ethanol precipitation
   and re-suspension in 500 il of sterile, deionized water. Amplification reactions were
   performed in 50 gl volumes containing 50 mM KCl; 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.8; 1.5 mM
30 MgC 2 ; 200 ptM of each dNTP; 2 jil template DNA; 20 pmol each of forward and
   reverse primer; and 1 unit Taq Polymerase (Life Technologies, Rockville, MD).
   Reactions were preheated at 94'C for 2 minutes, followed by thirty-five cycles of
   denaturing at 94'C for 1 minute, annealing at 50'C for 1 minute 30 seconds, and
                                                  18

   polymerization at 72'C for 2 minutes. The reactions were completed by a 10-minute
   extension at 72*C. Aliquots of the reaction products were examined for DNA products
   by agarose gel fractionation, and ligated directly into the pGEM-T Easy vector
   (Promega, Madison, WI). Resulting recombinant plasmids containing insert DNAs
 5 within the expected size range were sequenced using T7 and Sp6 primers.
   DNA sequencing
           All the DNA sequencing reactions were performed using the BIGDYETM
   Terminator Cycle sequencing kit (Perkin-Elmer, Wellesley, MA) with the sequences
10 being read on an automated ABI Prism 310 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems,
   Foster City, CA). Computer assessment of the DNA sequence information was
   performed using the MACVECTOR (Oxford Molecular, Madison, WI) software
   package.
15 cDNA library screening
           The cDNA library was screened with digoxigenin labeled probes. A 258 bp
   DNA fragment amplified from the pGEM-deg6.4 clone using gene-specific forward (5'
   GGCGGAGAATTTGTCCTGGAATGTCATTTGGTTTAG-3' (SEQ ID NO: 13)) and
   reverse (5'-GTACAATAGTGAGGTTGACAATG-3' (SEQ ID NO: 14)) primers; and a
20 374 bp DNA fragment amplified from the pBKS-CYPB3.843 clone with specific
   forward (5'-GGTGGTTGTGAATGCATG-3' (SEQ ID NO: 15)) and reverse (5'
   TTATGCAGCAATAGGCTTGAAGACA-3' (SEQ ID NO: 16)) primers, were used to
   screen for CYP71Ds. The probes were labeled with digoxigenin-11-dUTP using the
   PCR DIG Labeling Mix (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN), hybridized
25 to plaque lifts of the cDNA library plated at approximately 10,000 PFUs per 150 mm
   plate, and was hybridization detected with the DIG detection system according to the
   manufacturer's instructions (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN). Plaques
   exhibiting strong hybridization were plaque purified, auto-subcloned to their plasmid
   forms according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and
30 then subjected to DNA sequencing as described above.
                                                19

   RNA analysis
           RNA gel blot analysis was carried out using 10 pg aliquots of total RNA. RNA
   samples were heat-denatured at 70'C for 15 minutes in sample buffer (1x MOPS, 50%
   formamide, 16% formaldehyde, 30 % glycerol, and 3% ethidium bromide), and size
 5 fractionated on a 1.2% agarose gel containing lx MOPS and 18.1% formaldehyde.
   Uniformity of sample loading was determined by visual inspection of the gel for rRNA
   bands. The RNAs were then transferred to a Zeta Probe nylon membrane (Bio-Rad
   Laboratories, Hercules, CA) and hybridized according to the manufacturer's
   recommendations. Full-length cDNAs probes were labeled with [ 32 P]-dCTP (PRIME-IT
10 Kit, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) prior to hybridization. After hybridization, the
   membranes were washed in 2x SSC/0. 1% SDS once at room temperature followed by
   sequential washes in 0.2x SSC/0.1% SDS at 42*C and 65'C. Hybridization was
   detected with a Phosphoimager (Molecular Dynamics, model 445 SI).
15 Construction of yeast expression vectors.
           The coding regions of the P450 cDNAs were cloned into the pYeDP60
   expression vector (Urban et al., J. Biol. Chem. 272:19176-19186, 1990; Pompon et al.,
   Methods Enzymol. 272:51-64, 1996). Appropriate BamHI, EcoRI, and SstI restriction
   sites (underlined) were introduced via PCR primers containing these sequences either
20 upstream of the translation start site (ATG) or downstream of the stop codon (TAA or
   TGA). The primers used to amplify the CYP71D20 cDNA were 5'
   GGGGGATCCATGCAATTCTTCAGCTTGGTTTCC-3' (SEQ ID NO: 17) and 5'
   GGGGAATTCTTACTCTCGAGAAGGTTGATAAGG-3' (SEQ ID NO: 18); for the
   CYP82E1 cDNA 5'- CCCGGATCCATGTATCATCTTCTTTCTCCC-3' (SEQ ID NO:
25 19) and 5'- GGGGAATTCTCAATATTGATAAAGCGTAGGAGG-3' (SEQ ID NO:
   20) ; and for the CYP92A3 cDNA 5'
   CCCGGATCCATGCAATCCTTCAGCTTGGTTTCC-3' (SEQ ID NO: 21) and 5'
   GGGGAGCTCTCACTCGCAAGAAGATTGATAAGG-3' (SEQ ID NO: 22). Two
   long, overlapping (italicized) primers 5'
30 GCCATTATCGGCGCAA TACTAATCTCCAAACTCCGCGGTAAAAAATTCAAGCT
   CCCACCTGGTCCAACAGCAGTC-3' (SEQ ID NO: 23) and 5'

   CCGCCATTATCGGCGCAATACTA-3'                (SEQ ID NO: 24) coding for the N-terminal
                                                20

   sequence of CYP73A1 (GenEMBL Z17369) up to the hinge region were used for the
   modification of the membrane anchoring segment of CYP73A27 to avoid possible
   problems with intracellular targeting due to the unusual N-terminus (Nedelkina et al.,
   1999); the reverse primer used for both amplifications was 5'
 5 GGGGAGCTCTTATGCAGCAATAGGCTTGAAGAC-3' (SEQ ID NO: 25).
   CYP71D20 and CYP73A27 were amplified using full-length cDNA templates, whereas
   CYP82EI and CYP92A5 were amplified directly from the cDNA library template.
   Amplifications were performed in 50 pl reactions containing lx Pfx amplification
   buffer; 1 mM MgSO 4 ; 300 gM of each dNTP; 10 ng template DNA; 20 pmol each of
10 forward and reverse primer; and 1.25 units PLATINUM* Pfx Polymerase (Life
   Technologies, Rockville, MD). Reactions were preheated at 94'C for 2 minutes,
   followed by thirty-five cycles of denaturing at 94 0 C for 15 seconds, annealing at 550 C
   for 30 seconds, and elongating at 680 for 1.5 minutes. PCR products were ligated into
   the pGEM-T EASY vector (Promega, Madison, WI) and subcloned into the pYeDP60
15 vector. The resulting constructs were validated by a combination of PCR and DNA
   sequencing.
   Yeast expression studies
             Verified pYeDP60- P450 cDNA constructs were introduced into the yeast
20 WAT11 line, a derivative of the W303-1B strain (MAT a; ade 2-1; his 3-11; leu 2-3,
   112; ura 3-1; canR; cyr+), provided by Dr. P. Urban (Centre de G6n6tique Mol6culaire,
   CNRS, Gif-sur-Yvette, France). The endogenous NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase
   (CPR1) locus has been replaced with ATR1, a NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase
   from Arabidopsis thaliana(Pompon et al., Methods Enzymol. 272:51-64, 1996; Urban
25 et al., J. Biol. Chem. 272:19176-19186, 1997), in the WATI1 line. Yeast was grown
   overnight in a 30*C shaker in YPAD (lg/l yeast extract; 1 g/l peptone; 20 g/l glucose;
   200 mg/l adenine) liquid media. Cultures were harvested at an A600 between 0.5 and 1.5.
   Cells were collected by centrifugation at 2,500 x g for 5 minutes at 4 0C, and resuspended
   in ice-cold, sterile dH 20. Cells were pelleted again as above and resuspended in 1 M
30 sorbitol. Forty pl of yeast suspension was mixed with 0.5 to 1 pig plasmid DNA (in <5
   jl dH 20) in a pre-chilled 0.5 ml tube, and transferred to a chilled cuvette with a 0.2 cm
   electrode gap. One pulse at 1.5 kV, 25 pF, and 200 Ohms was applied by an Eppendorf
   Electroporator (model 2510). A mixture of 500 pl of YPAD/1 M sorbitol was
                                                21

   immediately added to the electroporated cells. Cells were allowed to recover at 30*C for
   1 hour, then spread onto SGI plates (1 g/l bactocasamino acids; 7 g/l yeast nitrogen base;
   20 g/l glucose; 20 mg/l tryptophan; and 20 g/1 agar). Transformed colonies appeared
   after 3 to 6 days of incubation at 30'C. Recombinant plasmids were confirmed by PCR
 5 assays performed directly on randomly selected yeast colonies.
           For expression studies, one colony was added to SGI media (1 g/l bactocasamino
   acids; 7 g/l yeast nitrogen base; 20 g/l glucose; and 20 mg/1 tryptophan) and grown at
   301C for approximately 24 hours. An aliquot of this culture was diluted 1:50 into 250
   ml of YPGE (10 g/1 bactopeptone; 10 g/l yeast extract; 5 g/l glucose; and 3% ethanol by
10 volume) and the cells were grown until all glucose was consumed. The absence of
   glucose was determined by placing a 200 pl aliquot of culture into a 1.5 ml tube,
   inserting a DIASTIX urinalysis reagent strip (Bayer, Elkhart, IN) for 30 seconds, and
   observing colorimetric changes indicating glucose levels. Induction was initiated by the
   addition of 5 grams of galactose (final concentration of 2%). The cultures were
15 maintained at 30'C for an additional 16 hours before collecting the cells by
   centrifugation at 7,000 x g for 10 minutes. The pelleted cells were washed with 100 ml
   of TES buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH, 7.5; 1 mM EDTA; 0.6 M sorbitol). The cells were
   centrifuged as above, resuspended in 100 ml of TES-M (TES supplemented with 10 mM
   2-mercaptoethanol), and allowed to incubate at room temperature for 10 minutes. The
20 yeast cells were centrifuged again at 7,000 x g for 10 minutes, and the pellet was
   resuspended in 2.5 ml extraction buffer (1%bovine serum albumin, fraction V; 2 mM 2
   mercaptoethanol; 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, all dissolved in TES). Glass
   beads (0.5 mm in diameter, Biospec Products, Inc., Bartlesville, OK) were added until
   skimming the surface of the cell suspension. Cell walls were disrupted manually by hand
25 shaking in a cold room for 10 min at 30 second intervals separated by 30 second
   intervals on ice. Cell extracts were transferred to a 50 ml centrifuge tube, the glass
   beads were washed three times with 5 ml of extraction buffer, and the washes were
   pooled with the original cell extracts. Microsomes were prepared by differential
   centrifugation at 10,000 g for 10 minutes at 4*C to remove cellular debris, followed by
30 centrifugation at 100,000 x g for 70 minnutes at 4'C, and microsomal pellets were
   resuspended in 1.5 ml TEG-M buffer (50 mM Tris-HCI, pH 7.5; 1 mM EDTA; 20%
   glycerol; and 1.5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol) and stored frozen at -80*C until further
   assayed.
                                                 22

   CO difference spectra
            Fe2 - CO vs. Fe     difference spectroscopy (Omura and Sato, J. Biol. Chem.
   239:2370-2378, 1964) was performed using 0.4 ml of microsomes suspended in 1.6 ml
 5 of 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5; 1 mM EDTA; and 20% glycerol. A small amount of the
   reducing agent, sodium dithionite, was added, and the mixture was distributed between
   two cuvettes. A baseline was recorded between 400 and 500 nm on a Perkin Elmer
   Lambda 18 UV/visible spectrophotometer. CO was then bubbled into the sample
   cuvette for 1 minute, and the difference spectrum recorded again. The amount of
10 functional P450 was estimated based on an absorbance coefficient of 91 mM-' - cm-'.
   5-epi-aristolochene-1, 3-hydroxylase assays
            5-epi-aristolochene-1, 3-hydroxylase assays were performed in 0.5 ml
   polyethylene tubes in 100 pl volumes. 5-epi-aristolochene or 1-deoxycapsidiol
15 dissolved in hexane was added to the tube, and the organic solvent was removed by
   incubation of the open tube at 30'C. 5-epi-aristolochene and 1-deoxycapsidiol were
   resuspended in 2 pl dimethyl sulfoxide before adding the reaction mixture. Reactions
   were carried out in 100 mM Tris-HCI, pH 7.5, to which microsomal protein was added
   to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml. Reactions were initiated by the addition of 2 mM
20 NADPH. The final concentration of 5-epi-aristolochene and 1-deoxycapsidiol in these
   assays varied from 20 to 50 gM. After incubations for variable lengths of time at 30'C,
   the reactions were extracted with two volumes of ethyl acetate. The organic extracts
   were concentrated and evaluated by GC and GC-MS along with standards of 5-epi
   aristolochene (Whitehead et al., Phytochemistry 28:775-779, 1989; Rising et al., J. Am.
25 Chem. Soc. 122:1861-1866, 2000), 1-deoxycapsidiol (Whitehead et al., Phytochemistry
   29:479-182, 1990), and capsidiol (Whitehead et al., Phytochemistry 26:1367-1369,
    1987; Milat et al., Phytochemistry 30:2171-2173, 1991). GC analysis was routinely
   performed with an HP5890 GC equipped with a Hewlett-Packard HP-5 capillary column
   (30 m x 0.25 mm, 0.25 pm phase thickness) and FID as described previously (Rising et
30 al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 122:1861-1866, 2000). GC-MS analysis was performed at the
   University of Kentucky Mass Spectrometry Facility using a Varian 3400 gas
   chromatograph and a Finnigan INCOS 50 quadrupole mass selective detector. The GC
   was equipped with a J&W DB-5ms capillary column (15 m x 0.25 mm, 0.25 pm phase
                                                 23

   thickness) and run with He as the carrier gas (10 psi.). Splitless injections were done at
   an injection port temperature of 280*C. The column temperature was maintained at
   40*C for 1 minute and then increased to 280 0 C at 10 C per minute. Following
   separation by the GC column, samples were introduced directly into the electron impact
 5 ionization source. Mass spectra were acquired at 70 eV, scanning from 40-440 Da in 1
   second.
   Production of cytochrome P450s
            Using the standard molecular techniques described herein, the isolation of
10 additional cytochrome P450 coding sequences is readily accomplished. For example,
   using all or a portion of the amino acid sequence of any of the disclosed P450s, one may
   readily design P450-specific oligonucleotide probes, including P450 degenerate
   oligonucleotide probes (i.e., a mixture of all possible coding sequences for a given
   amino acid sequence). These oligonucleotides may be based upon the sequence of either
15 DNA strand and any appropriate portion of the P450 nucleotide sequence. General
   methods for designing and preparing such probes are provided, for example, in Ausubel
   et al., 2000, Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Wiley Interscience, New York, and
   Berger and Kimmel, Guide to Molecular Cloning Techniques, 1987, Academic Press,
   New York. These oligonucleotides are useful for P450 gene isolation, either through
20 their use as probes capable of hybridizing to a P450 complementary sequence, or as
   primers for various amplification techniques, for example, polymerase chain reaction
   (PCR) cloning strategies.
            Hybridization techniques and screening procedures are well known to those
   skilled in the art and are described, for example, in Ausubel et al. (supra); Berger and
25 Kimmel (supra); Chen et al., Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 324:255, 1995; and Sambrook et
   al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press,
   New York. If desired, a combination of different oligonucleotide probes may be used
   for the screening of a recombinant DNA library. The oligonucleotides may be
   detectably-labeled using methods known in the art and used to probe filter replicas from
30 a recombinant DNA library. Recombinant DNA libraries are prepared according to
   methods well known in the art, for example, as described in Ausubel et al. (supra), or
   they may be obtained from commercial sources.
                                                24

           As discussed above, P450 oligonucleotides may also be used as primers in a
   polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification cloning strategy. PCR methods are well
   known in the art and are described, for example, in PCR Technology, Erlich, ed.,
   Stockton Press, London, 1989; PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Applications,
 5 Innis et al., eds., Academic Press, Inc., New York, 1990; and Ausubel et al. (supra).
   Primers are optionally designed to allow cloning of the amplified product into a suitable
   vector, for example, by including appropriate restriction sites at the 5' and 3' ends of the
   amplified fragment (as described herein). If desired, a P450 gene may be isolated using
   the PCR "RACE" technique, or Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (see, e.g., Innis et
10 al. (supra)). By this method, oligonucleotide primers based on a P450 sequence are
   oriented in the 3' and 5' directions and are used to generate overlapping PCR fragments.
   These overlapping 3'- and 5'-end RACE products are combined to produce an intact full
   length cDNA. This method is described in Innis et al. (supra); and Frohman et al., Proc.
   Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85:8998, (1988).
15         Additional methods for identifying sequences encoding P450s are provided in
   Maughan et al. (Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 341:104-111, 1997) and Clark et al. (Plant
   Mol. Biol. 33:875-885, 1997).
           Useful P450 sequences may be isolated from any appropriate organism.
   Confirmation of a sequence's relatedness to a P450 polypeptide disclosed herein may be
20 accomplished by a variety of conventional methods, for example, by comparing the
   sequence with a known p450 sequence found in a database. In addition, the activity of
   any P450 may be evaluated according to any of the techniques described herein.
   P450 polypeptide expression
25         P450 polypeptides may be produced by transformation of a suitable host cell
   with all or part of a P450 DNA (for example, any one of the P450 cDNAs described
   herein) in a suitable expression vehicle or with a plasmid construct engineered for
   increasing the expression of a P450 polypeptide in vivo.
           Those skilled in the field of molecular biology will appreciate that any of a wide
30 variety of expression systems may be used to provide the recombinant protein. The
   precise host cell used is not critical to the invention. The P450 protein may be produced
   in a prokaryotic host, for example, E. coli TB 1, or in a eukaryotic host, for example,
   Saccharomyces cerevisiae,insect cells, mammalian cells (for example, COS 1 or NIH
                                                   25

   3T3 cells), or any of a number of plant cells including, without limitation, algae, tree
   species, ornamental species, temperate fruit species, tropical fruit species, vegetable
   species, legume species, monocots, dicots, or in any plant of commercial or agricultural
   significance. Particular examples of suitable plant hosts include, but are not limited to,
 5 Conifers, Petunia, Tomato, Potato, Tobacco, Grape, Arabidopsis, Lettuce, Sunflower,
   Oilseed rape, Flax, Cotton, Sugarbeet, Celery, Soybean, Alfalfa, Medicago, Lotus,
   Vigna, Cucumber, Carrot, Eggplant, Cauliflower, Horseradish, Morning Glory, Poplar,
   Walnut, Apple, Asparagus, Grape, Rice, Maize, Millet, Onion, Barley, Orchard grass,
   Oat, Rye, Tobacco, and Wheat.
10         Such cells are available from a wide range of sources including: the American
   Type Culture Collection (Rockland, Md.); or from any of a number seed companies, for
   example, W. Atlee Burpee Seed Co. (Warminster, Pa.), Park Seed Co. (Greenwood,
   S.C.), Johnny Seed Co. (Albion, Me.), or Northrup King Seeds (Harstville, S.C.).
   Descriptions and sources of useful host cells are also found in Vasil I. K., Cell Culture
15 and Somatic Cell Genetics of Plants, Vol I, II, III Laboratory Procedures and Their
   Applications Academic Press, New York, 1984; Dixon, R. A., Plant Cell Culture--A
   Practical Approach, IRL Press, Oxford University, 1985; Green et al., Plant Tissue and
   Cell Culture, Academic Press, New York, 1987; and Gasser and Fraley, Science
   244:1293, (1989).
20         For prokaryotic expression, DNA encoding a P450 polypeptide is carried on a
   vector operably linked to control signals capable of effecting expression in the
   prokaryotic host. If desired, the coding sequence may contain, at its 5' end, a sequence
   encoding any of the known signal sequences capable of effecting secretion of the
   expressed protein into the periplasmic space of the host cell, thereby facilitating
25 recovery of the protein and subsequent purification. Prokaryotes most frequently used
   are various strains of E. coli; however, other microbial strains may also be used.
   Plasmid vectors are used which contain replication origins, selectable markers, and
   control sequences derived from a species compatible with the microbial host. Examples
   of such vectors are found in Pouwels et al. (supra) or Ausubel et al. (supra). Commonly
30 used prokaryotic control sequences (also referred to as "regulatory elements") are
   defined herein to include promoters for transcription initiation, optionally with an
   operator, along with ribosome binding site sequences. Promoters commonly used to
   direct protein expression include the beta-lactamase (penicillinase), the lactose (lac), the
                                                26

    tryptophan (Trp) (Goeddel et al., Nucl. Acids Res. 8:4057 (1980)), and the tac promoter
    systems, as well as the lambda-derived P.sub.L promoter and N-gene ribosome binding
    site (Simatake et al., Nature 292:128 (1981)).
            One particular bacterial expression system for P450 production is the E. coli pET
 5  expression system (Novagen). According to this expression system, DNA encoding a
    P450 is inserted into a pET vector in an orientation designed to allow expression. Since
    the P450 gene is under the control of the T7 regulatory signals, P450 expression is
    dependent on inducing the expression of T7 RNA polymerase in the host cell. This is
    typically achieved using host strains which express T7 RNA polymerase in response to
10  IPTG induction. Once produced, recombinant P450 is then isolated according to
    standard methods known in the art, for example, those described herein.
            Another bacterial expression system for P450 production is the pGEX expression
    system (Pharmacia). This system employs a GST gene fusion system that is designed
    for high-level expression of a gene or gene fragment as a fusion protein with rapid
15  purification and recovery of the functional gene product. The P450 of interest is fused
    to the carboxyl terminus of the glutathione S-transferase protein from Schistosoma
   japonicum and is readily purified from bacterial lysates by affinity chromatography
    using Glutathione Sepharose 4B. Fusion proteins can be recovered under mild
    conditions by elution with glutathione. Cleavage of the glutathione S-transferase
20  domain from the fusion protein is facilitated by the presence of recognition sites for site
    specific proteases upstream of this domain. For example, proteins expressed in pGEX
    2T plasmids may be cleaved with thrombin; those expressed in pGEX-3X may be
    cleaved with factor Xa.
            Other prokaryotic systems useful for expressing eukaryotic P450s are described
25  by Cooper (Mutat. Res. 454:45-52, 2000) and Dong et al. (Arch. Biochem. Biophys.
    327:254-259, 1996). In addition, strategies for enhancing the prokaryotic expression of
    a cytochrome P450 in combination with cytochrome reductase are described in Porter et
    al. (Drug. Metab. Rev. 31:159-174, 1999).
            For eukaryotic expression, the method of transformation or transfection and the
30  choice of vehicle for expression of the P450 will depend on the host system selected.
    Transformation and transfection methods of numerous organisms, for example, the
    baker's yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, are described, e.g., in Ausubel et al. (supra);

   and the references cited above.
            One preferred eukaryotic expression system is the mouse 3T3 fibroblast host cell
10 transfected with a pMAMneo expression vector (Clontech). pMAMneo provides: an
   RSV-LTR enhancer linked to a dexamethasone-inducible MMTV-LTR promoter, an
   SV40 origin of replication which allows replication in mammalian systems, a selectable
   neomycin gene, and SV40 splicing and polyadenylation sites. DNA encoding a P450 is
   inserted into the pMAMneo vector in an orientation designed to allow expression. The
15 recombinant P450 is then isolated as described below. Other preferable host cells which
   may be used in conjunction with the pMAMneo expression vehicle include COS cells
   and CHO cells (ATCC Accession Nos. CRL 1650 and CCL 61, respectively).
            Alternatively, if desired, a P450 is produced by a stably-transfected mammalian
   cell line. A number of vectors suitable for stable transfection of mammalian cells are
20 available to the public, e.g., see Pouwels et al. (supra); methods for constructing such
   cell lines are also publicly available, e.g., in Ausubel et al. (supra). In one example,
   cDNA encoding the P450 is cloned into an expression vector which includes the
   dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) gene. Integration of the plasmid and, therefore, the
   P450-encoding gene into the host cell chromosome is selected for by inclusion of 0.01
25 300 pM methotrexate in the cell culture medium (as described in Ausubel et al., supra).
   This dominant selection can be accomplished in most cell types. Recombinant protein
   expression can be increased by DHFR-mediated amplification of the transfected gene.
   Methods for selecting cell lines bearing gene amplifications are described in Ausubel et
   al. (supra); such methods generally involve extended culture in medium containing
30 gradually increasing levels of methotrexate. DHFR-containing expression vectors
   commonly used for this purpose include pCVSEII-DHrF and pAdD26SV(A) (described
   in Ausubel et al., supra). Any of the host cells described above or, preferably, a DHFR
   deficient CHO cell line (for example, CHO DHFR cells, ATCC Accession Number CRL
                                                   28

   9096) are among the host cells preferred for DHFR selection of a stably-transfected cell
   line or DHFR-mediated gene amplification.
          A cytochrome P450 may also be produced in insect cells, such cells include,
   without limitation, Spodopterafrugiperda(Sf)-9, Sf-2 1, or Drosophilamelanogaster
 5 Schneider (SL-2) cells. For P450 production, insect cells are typically infected with a
   baculovirus, for example, Autographa californicaMultiple Nuclear Polyhedrosis Virus
   (AcMNPV) containing an expression cassette for such a protein, e.g., cytochrome P450,
   at a multiplicity of infection of 1 to 10. The infected cells are generally cultured in a
   standard insect cell culture medium for 24 to 48 hours prior to recovering the protein
10 using standard molecular biology techniques. If desired, a P450 polypeptide may also
   be produced in insect cells directly transfected with a DNA construct containing an
   expression cassette encoding the P450.
           Furthermore, any of the cytochrome P450s described herein may be produced in
   yeast, for example, Pichiapastoris. In order to produce the P450, yeast cells are
15 transformed with an expression cassette containing, for example, a promoter such as the
   AOXl or phosphoglycerate kinase gene promoter, the P450 gene to be expressed, and a
   terminator. Such an expression cassette may contain an origin of replication or it may
   be integrated into the yeast genomic DNA. The expression cassette is generally
   introduced by lithium acetate transformation or by the use of spheroplasts. In order to
20 select for successfully transformed cells, the yeast are plated, for example, on minimal
   media which only allows yeast carrying the introduced expression cassette to grow.
           In addition, expression of recombinant proteins in yeast using a Hansenula
   polymorpha expression system is described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,741,674 and
   5,672,487.
25         A P450 may also be produced by a stably-transfected plant cell line or by a
   transgenic plant. Such genetically-engineered plants are useful for a variety of industrial
   and agricultural applications as discussed below. Importantly, this invention is
   applicable to gymnosperms and angiosperms, and will be readily applicable to any new
   or improved transformation or regeneration method.
30         A number of vectors suitable for stable transfection of plant cells or for the
   establishment of transgenic plants are available to the public; such vectors are described
   in Pouwels et al. (supra), Weissbach and Weissbach (supra), and Gelvin et al. (supra).
   Methods for constructing such cell lines are described in, e.g., Weissbach and
                                                 29

   Weissbach (supra), and Gelvin et al. (supra). Typically, plant expression vectors include
   (1) a cloned P450 gene under the transcriptional control of 5' and 3' regulatory sequences
   and (2) a dominant selectable marker. Such plant expression vectors may also contain,
   if desired, a promoter regulatory region (for example, one conferring inducible or
 5 constitutive expression, or environmentally- or developmentally-regulated, or pathogen
   or wound-inducible, or cell- or tissue-specific expression), a transcription initiation start
   site, a ribosome binding site, an RNA processing signal, a transcription termination site,
   and/or a polyadenylation signal.
          The P450 DNA sequence of the invention may, if desired, be combined with other
10 DNA sequences in a variety of ways. The P450 DNA sequence of the invention may be
   employed with all or part of the gene sequences normally associated with a P450. In its
   component parts, a DNA sequence encoding a P450 is combined in a DNA construct
   having a transcription initiation control region capable of promoting transcription and
   translation in a host cell.
15         In general, the constructs will involve regulatory regions functional in plants
   which provide for production of a P450 as discussed herein. The open reading frame
   coding for the P450, or a functional fragment thereof, will be joined at its 5' end to a
   transcription initiation regulatory region such as the sequence naturally found in the 5'
   upstream region of a P450 structural gene, for example, a CYP71D20 (SEQ ID NO:2) or
20 CYP7 1D21 (SEQ ID NO:4) gene. Numerous other transcription initiation regions are
   available which provide for constitutive or inducible regulation.
           For applications when developmental, cell, tissue, hormonal, environmental, or
   pathogen-inducible expression are desired, appropriate 5' upstream non-coding regions
   are obtained from other genes; for example, from genes regulated during seed
25 development, embryo development, leaf development, or in response to a pathogen.
          Regulatory transcript termination regions may also be provided in DNA constructs
   of this invention as well. Transcript termination regions may be provided by the DNA
   sequence encoding a P450 or any convenient transcription termination region derived
   from a different gene source. The transcript termination region will contain preferably
30 at least 1-3 kb of sequence 3' to the structural gene from which the termination region is
   derived.
                                                  30

            An example of a useful plant promoter according to the invention is a
   caulimovirus promoter, such as, a cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) promoter. These
   promoters confer high levels of expression in most plant tissues, and the activity of these
   promoters is not dependent on virally encoded proteins. CaMV is a source for both the
 5 35S and 19S promoters. In most tissues of transgenic plants, the CaMV 35S promoter is
   a strong promoter (see, e.g., Odell et al., Nature 313:810 (1985)). The CaMV promoter
   is also highly active in monocots (see, e.g., Dekeyser et al., Plant Cell 2:591 (1990);
   Terada and Shimamoto, Mol. Gen. Genet. 220:389, (1990)). Moreover, activity of this
   promoter can be further increased (i.e., between 2-10 fold) by duplication of the CaMV
10 35S promoter (see e.g., Kay et al., Science 236:1299 (1987); Ow et al., Proc. Natl. Acad.
   Sci. U.S.A. 84:4870 (1987); and Fang et al., Plant Cell 1:141 (1989)). Other useful plant
   promoters include, without limitation, the nopaline synthase promoter (An et al., Plant
   Physiol. 88:547 (1988)) and the octopine synthase promoter (Fromm et al., Plant Cell
   1:977 (1989)).
15          For certain applications, it may be desirable to produce the P450 gene product in
   an appropriate tissue, at an appropriate level, or at an appropriate developmental time.
   For this purpose, there is an assortment of gene promoters, each with its own distinct
   characteristics embodied in its regulatory sequences, which have been shown to be
   regulated in response to the environment, hormones, and/or developmental cues. These
20 include gene promoters that are responsible for heat-regulated gene expression (see, e.g.,
   Callis et al., Plant Physiol. 88:965 (1988); Takahashi and Komeda, Mol. Gen. Genet.
   219:365 (1989); and Takahashi et al., Plant J. 2:751(1992)), light-regulated gene
   expression (e.g., the pea rbcS-3A described by Kuhlemeier et al. (Plant Cell 1:471
   (1989); the maize rbcS promoter described by Schaffier and Sheen, (Plant Cell 3:997
25 (1991); or the chlorophyll a/b-binding protein gene found in pea described by Simpson
   et al. (EMBO J. 4:2723 (1985)), hormone-regulated gene expression (for example, the
   abscisic acid (ABA) responsive sequences from the Em gene of wheat described by
   Marcotte et al. (Plant Cell 1:969 (1989); the ABA-inducible HVA1 and HVA22, and the
   rd29A promoters described for barley and Arabidopsis by Straub et al. (Plant Cell 6:617
30 (1994), Shen et al. (Plant Cell 7:295 (1994)), and wound-induced gene expression (for
   example, of wunI described by Siebertz et al. (Plant Cell 1:961 (1989)), or organ
   specific gene expression (for example, of the tuber-specific storage protein gene
   described by Roshal et al. (EMBO J. 6:1155 (1987); the 23-kDa zein gene from maize
                                                 31

   described by Schernthaner et al. (EMBO J. 7:1249 (1988); or the French bean beta
   phaseolin gene described by Bustos et al., (Plant Cell 1:839 (1989)); and pathogen
   inducible gene expression described by Chappell et al. in U.S. Ser. Nos. 08/471,983,
   08/443,639, and 08/577,483, hereby incorporated by reference.
 5        Plant expression vectors may also optionally include RNA processing signals, for
   example, introns, which have been shown to be important for efficient RNA synthesis
   and accumulation (Callis et al., Genes and Dev. 1:1183 (1987)). The location of the
   RNA splice sequences can dramatically influence the level of transgene expression in
   plants. In view of this fact, an intron may be positioned upstream or downstream of a
10 P450-encoding sequence in the transgene to modulate levels of gene expression.
          In addition to the aforementioned 5' regulatory control sequences, the expression
   vectors may also include regulatory control regions which are generally present in the 3'
   regions of plant genes (Thornburg et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 84:744 (1987);
   An et al., Plant Cell 1:115 (1989)). For example, the 3' terminator region may be
15 included in the expression vector to increase stability of the mRNA. One such
   terminator region may be derived from the PI-II terminator region of potato. In addition,
   other commonly used terminators are derived from the octopine or nopaline synthase
   signals.
          The plant expression vector also typically contains a dominant selectable marker
20 gene used to identify those cells that have become transformed. Useful selectable genes
   for plant systems include genes encoding antibiotic resistance genes, for example, those
   encoding resistance to hygromycin, kanamycin, bleomycin, G418, streptomycin, or
   spectinomycin. Genes required for photosynthesis may also be used as selectable
   markers in photosynthetic-deficient strains. Alternatively, the green-fluorescent protein
25 from the jellyfish Aequorea victoria may be used as a selectable marker (Sheen et al.,
   Plant J. 8:777, 1995; Chiu et al., Current Biology 6:325 (1996)). Finally, genes
   encoding herbicide resistance may be used as selectable markers; useful herbicide
   resistance genes include the bar gene encoding the enzyme phosphinothricin
   acetyltransferase and conferring resistance to the broad-spectrum herbicide BASTA
30 (Hoechst AG, Frankfurt, Germany).
          Efficient use of selectable markers is facilitated by a determination of the
   susceptibility of a plant cell to a particular selectable agent and a determination of the
   concentration of this agent which effectively kills most, if not all, of the transformed
                                                   32

   cells. Some useful concentrations of antibiotics for tobacco transformation include, e.g.,
   75-100 pg/ml (kanamycin), 20-50 gg/ml (hygromycin), or 5-10 pg/ml (bleomycin). A
   useful strategy for selection of transformants for herbicide resistance is described, e.g.,
   by Vasil et al., supra.
 5         It should be readily apparent to one skilled in the art of molecular biology,
   especially in the field of plant molecular biology, that the level of gene expression is
   dependent, not only on the combination of promoters, RNA processing signals, and
   terminator elements, but also on how these elements are used to increase the levels of
   selectable marker gene expression.
10
   Plant transformation
            Upon construction of the plant expression vector, several standard methods are
   available for introduction of the vector into a plant host, thereby generating a transgenic
   plant. These methods include (1) Agrobacterium-mediated transformation (A.
15 tumefaciens or A. rhizogenes) (see, e.g., Lichtenstein and Fuller, In: Genetic
   Engineering, vol. 6, PWJ Rigby, ed, London, Academic Press, 1987; and Lichtenstein,
   C. P., and Draper, J., In: DNA Cloning, Vol II, D. M. Glover, ed, Oxford, IRI Press,
    1985)), (2) the particle delivery system (see, e.g., Gordon-Kamm et al., Plant Cell 2:603
   (1990); or BioRad Technical Bulletin 1687, supra), (3) microinjection protocols (see,
20 e.g., Green et al., supra), (4) polyethylene glycol (PEG) procedures (see, e.g., Draper et
   al., Plant Cell Physiol. 23:451 (1982); or e.g., Zhang and Wu, Theor. Appl. Genet.
   76:835 (1988)), (5) liposome-mediated DNA uptake (see, e.g., Freeman et al., Plant Cell
   Physiol. 25:1353 (1984)), (6) electroporation protocols (see, e.g., Gelvin et al., supra;
   Dekeyser et al., supra; Fromm et al., Nature 319:791 (1986); Sheen, Plant Cell 2:1027
25 (1990); or Jang and Sheen, Plant Cell 6:1665 (1994)), and (7) the vortexing method (see,
   e.g., Kindle, supra). The method of transformation is not critical to the present
   invention. Any method which provides for efficient transformation may be employed.
   As newer methods are available to transform crops or other host cells, they may be
   directly applied.
30         The following is an example outlining one particular technique, an
   Agrobacterium-mediated plant transformation. By this technique, the general process
   for manipulating genes to be transferred into the genome of plant cells is carried out in
   two phases. First, cloning and DNA modification steps are carried out in E. coli, and the
                                                 33

   plasmid containing the gene construct of interest is transferred by conjugation or
   electroporation into Agrobacterium. Second, the resulting Agrobacterium strain is used
   to transform plant cells. Thus, for the generalized plant expression vector, the plasmid
   contains an origin of replication that allows it to replicate in Agrobacterium and a high
 5 copy number origin of replication functional in E coli. This permits facile production
   and testing of transgenes in E coli prior to transfer to Agrobacterium for subsequent
   introduction into plants. Resistance genes can be carried on the vector, one for selection
   in bacteria, for example, streptomycin, and another that will function in plants, for
   example, a gene encoding kanamycin resistance or herbicide resistance. Also present on
10 the vector are restriction endonuclease sites for the addition of one or more transgenes
   and directional T-DNA border sequences which, when recognized by the transfer
   functions of Agrobacterium, delimit the DNA region that will be transferred to the plant.
          In another example, plant cells may be transformed by shooting into the cell
   tungsten microprojectiles on which cloned DNA is precipitated. In the Biolistic
15 Apparatus (Bio-Rad) used for the shooting, a gunpowder charge (22 caliber Power
   Piston Tool Charge) or an air-driven blast drives a plastic macroprojectile through a gun
   barrel. An aliquot of a suspension of tungsten particles on which DNA has been
   precipitated is placed on the front of the plastic macroprojectile. The latter is fired at an
   acrylic stopping plate that has a hole through it that is too small for the macroprojectile
20 to pass through. As a result, the plastic macroprojectile smashes against the stopping
   plate, and the tungsten microprojectiles continue toward their target through the hole in
   the plate. For the present invention, the target can be any plant cell, tissue, seed, or
   embryo. The DNA introduced into the cell on the microprojectiles becomes integrated
   into either the nucleus or the chloroplast.
25        In general, transfer and expression of transgenes in plant cells are now routine
   practices to those skilled in the art, and have become major tools to carry out gene
   expression studies in plants and to produce improved plant varieties of agricultural or
   commercial interest.
30 Transgenic plant regeneration
            Plants cells transformed with plant expression vectors can be regenerated, for
   example, from single cells, callus tissue, or leaf discs according to standard plant tissue
   culture techniques. It is well known in the art that various cells, tissues, and organs from
                                                 34

   almost any plant can be successfully cultured to regenerate an entire plant; such
   techniques are described, e.g., in Vasil supra; Green et al., supra; Weissbach and
   Weissbach, supra; and Gelvin et al., supra.
           In one particular example, a cloned P450, under the control of the EAS4 promoter
 5 and the nopaline synthase terminator and carrying a selectable marker (for example,
   kanamycin resistance), is transformed into Agrobacterium. Transformation of leaf discs
   (for example, of tobacco leaf discs), with vector-containing Agrobacterium is carried out
   as described by Horsch et al. (Science 227:1229 (1985)). Putative transformants are
   selected after a few weeks (for example, 3 to 5 weeks) on plant tissue culture media
10 containing kanamycin (e.g., 100 pg/ml). Kanamycin-resistant shoots are then placed on
   plant tissue culture media without hormones for root initiation. Kanamycin-resistant
   plants are then selected for greenhouse growth. If desired, seeds from self-fertilized
   transgenic plants can then be sowed in soil-less medium and grown in a greenhouse.
   Kanamycin-resistant progeny are selected by sowing surface sterilized seeds on
15 hormone-free kanamycin-containing media. Analysis for the integration of the
   transgene is accomplished by standard techniques (see, for example, Ausubel et al.,
   supra; Gelvin et al., supra).
          Transgenic plants expressing the selectable marker are then screened for
   transmission of the transgene DNA by standard immunoblot and DNA detection
20 techniques. Each positive transgenic plant and its transgenic progeny is unique in
   comparison to other transgenic plants established with the same transgene. Integration
   of the transgene DNA into the plant genomic DNA is in most cases random, and the site
   of integration can profoundly affect the levels and the tissue and developmental patterns
   of transgene expression. Consequently, a number of transgenic lines are usually
25 screened for each transgene to identify and select plants with the most appropriate
   expression profiles.
         Transgenic lines are generally evaluated for levels of transgene expression.
   Expression at the RNA level is determined initially to identify and quantitate expression
   positive plants. Standard techniques for RNA analysis are employed and include PCR
30 amplification assays using oligonucleotide primers designed to amplify only transgene
   RNA templates and solution hybridization assays using transgene-specific probes (see,
   e.g., Ausubel et al., supra). The RNA-positive plants are then analyzed for protein
   expression by Western immunoblot analysis using specific antibodies to the P450 (see,
                                                35

   e.g., Ausubel et al., supra). In addition, in situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry
   according to standard protocols can be done using transgene-specific nucleotide probes
   and antibodies, respectively, to localize sites of expression within transgenic tissue.
           Once the recombinant P450 is expressed in any cell or in a transgenic plant (for
 5 example, as described above), it may be isolated, e.g., using affinity chromatography. In
   one example, an anti-P450 antibody (e.g., produced as described in Ausubel et al., supra,
   or by any standard technique) may be attached to a column and used to isolate the
   polypeptide. Lysis and fractionation of P450-producing cells prior to affinity
   chromatography may be performed by standard methods (see, e.g., Ausubel et al.,
10 supra). Once isolated, the recombinant protein can, if desired, be further purified, for
   example, by high performance liquid chromatography (see, e.g., Fisher, Laboratory
   Techniques in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, eds., Work and Burdon, Elsevier,
   1980).
           These general techniques of polypeptide expression and purification can also be
15 used to produce and isolate useful P450 fragments or analogs.
   Use
           The aforementioned cytochrome P450 polypeptides of the invention are useful in
   the biosynthesis of hormones, lipids, and secondary metabolites, and may also help
20 plants tolerate potentially harmful exogenous chemicals such as herbicides, pesticides,
   and pollutants. In addition, such cytochrome P450 polypeptides are useful in the
   chemical defense of plants against insects, as well as against bacterial, viral, and fungal
   infection.
25 Engineering plant disease resistance
           Plasmid constructs designed for the expression of a P450 gene product are
   useful, for example, for activating plant defense pathways that confer anti-pathogenic
   properties to a transgenic plant, for example, the production of phytoalexins. P450
   genes that are isolated from a host plant (e.g., Nicotiana) may be engineered for
30 expression in the same plant, a closely related species, or a distantly related plant
   species. For example, a P450 gene may be engineered for constitutive low-level
   expression and then transformed into a Nicotiana host plant. Alternatively, the P450
   gene may be engineered for expression in other solanaceous plants, including, but not
                                                  36

   limited to, potato and tomato. To achieve pathogen resistance, it is important to express
   a P450 protein at an effective level. Evaluation of the level of pathogen protection
   conferred to a plant by ectopic expression of the P450 gene is determined according to
   conventional methods and assays.
 5
   Industrial applications
           The invention also includes engineering host cells to include novel isoprenoid
   metabolic pathways useful in the production of new isoprenoid compounds. By
   introducing genes encoding an isoprenoid synthase (as disclosed in U.S. Patent No.
10 5,824,774 and WO 00/17327) and a cytochrome P450, an acetyltransferase, a methyl
   transferase, a fatty acyltransferase, or a combination thereof, various isoprenoid reaction
   products may be modified, controlled, or manipulated, resulting in enhancement of
   production of numerous isoprenoid reaction products, for example, the production of
   novel monoterpenes, diterpenes, and sesquiterpenes. Such compounds are useful as
15 phytoalexins, insecticides, perfumes, and pharmaceuticals such as anti-bacterial and
   fungal agents.
           In one working example, an isoprenoid synthase or a chimeric isoprenoid
   synthase (as disclosed in U.S. Patent 5,824,774 and WO 00/17327) and a P450 gene are
   introduced into yeast, for example, using any of the procedures described herein. If
20 desired, such cells may also express, either independently or in combination, an
   acetyltransferase (see, for example, Walker et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 18:583
   587, 2000), a methylase transferase (see, for example, Diener et al., Plant Cell 12:853
   870, 2000) gene, or a fatty acyltransferase gene, as well as a cytochrome reductase.
   Cells are then cultured under standard conditions and the production of isoprenoid
25 compounds is assayed according to methods known in the art. Isoprenoid compounds
   are further purified according to methods well known in the art. Cells expressing novel
   isoprenoid compounds are taken as useful in the invention.
           Such methods provide a unique approach for producing novel isoprenoid starting
   materials and end products. Either prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells transformed with any
30 of the aforementioned enzymes (or combinations thereof) may be used. Moreover,
   isoprenoid compounds may be produced in any number of ways known in the art
   including an in vitro combination of purified enzymes with an appropriate substrate or
   direct fermentation using a host cell which expresses any combination of the
                                                 37

   aforementioned enzymes and the appropriate substrates sufficient to drive production of
   isoprenoid compounds.
           The invention is also useful for the production of insect attractants and deterrents, which
   may either deter insect pests or attract insect predators. In addition, the invention is also useful
 5 for generating novel flavorings and perfumes.
