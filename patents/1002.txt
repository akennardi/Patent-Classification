                                         Background
[1002]      Disclosed embodiments relate generally to aerosol formulations and medical devices,
systems and methods for delivering the same. More particularly, disclosed embodiments relate
to compositions, systems and methods for delivering medicaments transnasally into the lungs.
[1003]      Aerosolized medicines are frequently used to treat individuals suffering from
respiratory disease. For example, one known method for treating cystic fibrosis (CF) includes
restoring hydration to the affected airway surfaces via the inhalation of a hypertonic osmolyte
solution, which draws water onto the airway surface. Known methods often administer a seven
percent (7%) hypertonic saline (HS) solution.     Rehydration of the lubricant periciliarv layer
(PCL) of the airway surface facilitates mnucus clearance (MC) and. therefore. the rernoval of
inhaled infectious agents.

    WO 2013/163517                                                         PCT/US2013/038368
[1004]      Known methods for delivering aerosolized medicaments include the inhalation of
aerosols orally i.e., via an oral mouth piece or a spacer inserted into the patient's mouth. Some
known systems for oral inhalation include nebulizer devices, such as jet nebulizers, vibrating
mesh nebulizers or ultrasonic nebulizers, or metered dose inhalers (MDIs), or dry powder
inhalers (DPIs) to generate respirable aerosol particles (e.g., particles that are <10 gm in
diameter) from a liquid medicament, suspension and/or dry powder. Such known systems and
methods for oral delivery, however, often present an undesirable time burden on the patient. For
example, some known systems require 10-20 minutes to deliver a single dose of medication. For
subjects with chronic pulmonary disease for which the treatment regiment includes multiple
daily aerosol treatments. the time burden associated with oral drug delivery via jet nebulizers can
become substantial. It is not unconmon for patients undergoing treatment for cystic fibrosis to
spend 2-3 hours per day on the recommended treatments (Flume et al., Am J Respir Crit Care
Med. 2007 Nov 15;176(0):957-69; Sawicki et al .J Cyst Fibros. 2009 Mar;8(2):91-6).
[1005]      Moreover, some studies of treatment protocols for cystic fibrosis have suggested that
an increased number of treatments per day and/or delivery of higher amounts of salt.            For
example, two studies have described (1) the short tern (two weeks) beiieficial effects of inhaled
hypertonic saline (HS) four times daily on pulmonary function, MCC, and quality of life
(Donaldson et al., N Engl J Med. 2006 Jan 19;354(3):241-50) and (2) the long tenr (one year)
benefits of inhaled HS twice daily on lung function and reduction in pulmonary exacerbations
(Elkins et al., N Engl J Med 354(3):229-4I0(2006)).       A comparison of the Donaldson versus
Elkins suggests that the "nore salt" delivered, the greater the benefit in lung function.        In
particular, subjects in the Donaldson study exhibited a rean improvement in lung function (147
 nl improvement in FEVi) with four times daily administration (3.6 ml of 7% HS predicted
pulmronary deposition), which as approximately twice the improvement that was achieved in the
Elkins study (68 ml improvement in FEVi) with B.I.D. dosing (1L58 ml of 7% HS predicted
pulmonary deposition). Thus, as treatment regimens are irnproved to maximize the benefits of
HS administration, the time burden associated with oral drug delivery via jet nebulizers will
likely be exacerbated,
[1006]      In addition to the undesirable time burden associated with known methods for oral
delivery of aerosolized medicaments, known methods of periodic delivery over relatively short
time periods (e.g., 5 to 20 minutes per treatment) results in the delivery of nedicarncnts as
concentrated "boluses," which can be undesirable. The delivery of medicaments as a bolus leads
to a rapid increase of the active therapeutic agent at the targeted location over a short period of
time, often at levels above the necessary therapeutic concentration. Similarly, bolus delivery can
                                                2

    WO 2013/163517                                                         PCT/US2013/038368
lead to high systemic exposure to such agents. Such peak local and systemic concentrations
following bolus administration of inhaled aerosols can lead to undesirable safety and tolerability
profiles, which may prevent adoption of the therapy into the standard of care. For example,
chronic inhaled corticosteroids have been shown to have disease-modifying irnpact on the rate of
lung function decline in CF (Ren et al, J Pediatr., 153(6):746-51(2008)        de Boeck et al., Eur
Respir J, 37(5): 1091-5 (2011)).        Such methods, however, are accompanied by patients'
decreased linear growth, and increased insulin/oral hypoglycemic use due to the systemic
exposure.    As such, inhaled corticosteroids are not reconunended for general treatment of CF
lung disease (Flume et at, Am J Respir Crit Care Med. 2007 Nov 152 176(10):957-69).
[1007]      In response to the high time burden associated with oral delivery and/or the desire
increase the mass of salt delivered, some known nebulizers have been developed to deliver an
aerosol dose more quickly, such as, for example, within two to five minutes. Although such
known systems and methods may slightly shorten the treatment duration, even short aerosol
administrations of several different therapeutic agents several times per day can result in a
significant treatment burden. Moreover, as discussed above, some therapeutic agents may not be
suitable (effective and/or safe) for administration via an aerosol bolus delivered over short
periods.
[1008]      For example, delivery of up to 12% HS was evaluated (Robinson et al., Thorax. 1997
Oct;52(10):900-3), and resulted in the conclusion that HS concentrations higher than seven
percent are not well tolerated using known methods of aerosol delivery. Lack of tolerability of
HS therapy can be related to high rates of emission of NaCl mass from the nebulizer mouthpiece,
which leads to higi exposure of oroph aryngeal surfaces to -IS. Sinilarly, the high rates of NaCl
mass deposition in the lung can lead to adverse events such as chest tightness, cough and acute
decreases in lung function (Elkins et al.).    In chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
high rates of NaCl delivery initiate histamine release, which contributes to airway spasm (Taube
et al, Am J Respir Crit Care Mcd. 2001 Nov 15;164 (10 Pt 1): 1810-5).           On a cellular level,
administration of high rate of NaC mass to the airway epithelium substantially dehydrates the
airway epithelial cells, which can lead to cell shrinkage, inhibition of ciliary beat frequency and
release of inflammatory stirnuli leading to pulmonary inflammation (Zhou et al., Journal of
Cystic Fibrosis Vol, lOSupplement 1, Page S I 8).         Accordingly, using known methods to
increase the rate of delivery of an aerosolized medicaient can be undesirable.
[1009]      Other known methods for delivering aerosolized medicaments include transnasal
delivery of the aerosolized medicament to the affected airways.         Some known systems for
                                                3

    WO 2013/163517                                                         PCT/US2013/038368
transnasal delivery include a long, relatively narrow nasal cannula, through which the
aerosolized medicament is transported.         Such known systems and methods for transnasal
delivery, however, often result in undesirable rainout and/or sputtering of the medicament as it
passes through the nasal cannula.
[1010]      Moreover, known systems and methods for transnasal delivery often result in very
low deposition efficiencies of aerosol deposition in the lung due to aerosol impaction in the nasal
passages. For example, a study by Chua et al. showed overall deposition efficiencies of less than
about three percent (as compared with deposition efficiencies of approximately 15 percent or
higher for oral delivery of aerosolized medicaments). In particular, the study showed that only
0.3% of the emitted dose was deposited in the lungs in infants 0.3 to 1.4 month of age; only 2.9%
of the emitted dose deposited in the lungs of pediatric subjects 6.3 to 11.5 years of age; and only
2.7% of the emitted dose deposited in the lungs of subjects 15 years of age and older.         (See
generally H Chua et al., Eur. Respir. J. 7, 2185-2191 (1994)). More recently, Vecellio et al.
reported a 3.7% pulmonary deposition efficiency based on the dose from a nasal sonic jet
nebulizer.
[1011]      Thus, a need exists for improved compositions, systems and methods for delivering
medicaments transnasally into the lungs.

per day; and/or for up to 24 hours/day). Rainout and sputtering can be reduced and/or eliminated
over extended periods of treatment times, such as when a subject or patient is sleeping. This

    WO 2013/163517                                                        PCT/US2013/038368
arrangement allows the aerosol delivery system to deliver the aerosol to the subject's nose via a
nasal cannula for pulmonary delivery. In some embodiments, rainout may be reduced without
substantially decreasing the aerosol output (volume output) of the system. Accordingly, the
methods, apparatus, and systems described herein can enable extended aerosol administration
overnight via a nasal cannula while the patient is asleep. Such extended aerosol administration
would eliminate the daytime treatment burden presented with conventional bolus aerosol
delivery treatments.      Furthermore,    such extended     aerosol administration would enable
improvement in efficacy, effectiveness, safety and tolerability for therapeutic agents benefiting
from prolonged delivery at slower rates compared to bolus aerosol delivery.

[1072]      DELIVERY SYSTEMS
[1073]      FIG. 1 is a schematic block diagram of an aerosol delivery system 10 according to an
embodiment for delivering aerosolized medicaments        (ADEL)   according to an embodiment. The
aerosol delivery system 10 can be used to deliver any of the compositions according to any of the
methods described herein.     The system 10 includes an aerosol preparation assembly 100, a
medicament cartridge 300, a source of gas 400, a nasal cannula assembly 500, and a controller
600.
[1074]      The aerosol preparation assembly 100 can be configured to produce aerosolized
medicament having specific characteristics, such as a desired particle size (e.g. VMD of between
1 and 2 microns) and/or size distribution, aerosol concentration, aerosol volume, medicament
amount, flow rate, terminal velocity, and/or the like. The aerosol preparation assembly 100 can
be configured to generate both solid (i.e., fine solid particles in gas) and liquid (liquid droplets in
gas) aerosols, depending on the medicament. Any suitable mechanism can be employed for
generating aerosol including, but not limited to. as an aerosol spray (similar to commonly used
aerosol cans), an atomic nozzle (such as those based on the Venturi effect), any type of nebulizer
suitable for medicament delivery (mechanical, electrical, a current jet nebulizer, an ultrasonic
nebulizer, a vibrating mesh nebulizer etc.), an electrospray, a vibrating orifice aerosol generator
(VOAG), droplet expulsion techniques (e.g. such as commonly used in ink-jet printers), micro
scale nozzle membranes (e.g. such as can be generated via lithography, and particularly silicon
wafer lithography), and/or the like. The disclosed embodiments can be configured to generate
the aerosol independent of certain gas chararacteristics, such as, but not limited to, humidity,
temperature, and/or the like. Accordingly, the aerosol preparation assembly 100, and the other
aerosol preparation assemblies disclosed herein can receive inlet fluids (e.g., liquid medicament
and inlet gas) having a wide range of input characteristics (e.g., droplet size, humidity,
temperature), and can produce a repeatable outlet aerosol.
[1075]      Generally, any suitable design of the aerosol preparation assembly 100 that permits
generation and delivery of aerosolized medicament as described herein can be employed. For
example, the aerosol preparation assembly 100 can be configured to generate aerosol directly
from liquid medicament and an entrainment gas. In another example, the aerosol preparation
assembly 100 can be configured to generate an aerosol of the medicament prior to entrainment
                                                14

    WO 2013/163517                                                       PCT/US2013/038368
with the entrainment gas. The initial aerosol can be generated in a different stage of the aerosol
preparation assembly 100 than another stage where the entrainment of the aerosol occurs.
Further, any such stages of the aerosol preparation assembly 100 can be monolithically or
separately constructed.     In some embodiments, the aerosol preparation assembly 100 can be
configured to modify one or more characteristics of the aerosolized medicament to better
produce the specific characteristics associated with the indication to be treated, and can
accordingly comprise any suitable component necessary for performing such function(s). For
example, the aerosol preparation assembly 100 can be configured to increase the speed of the
generated aerosol as can be required to ensure delivery once the aerosol leaves the aerosol
preparation assembly 100. Further, in some embodiments, the aerosol preparation assembly 100
can include a machine-readable label and/or electronic circuit system for communication with
the controller 600 for monitoring, control, and/or generally modulating any of the functionality
of the aerosol preparation assembly 100 as described herein.
[1076]       The medicament cartridge 300 contains the medicament(s) to be aerosolized, and can
be configured to be removably coupled and/or operatively coupled to the aerosol preparation
assembly 100. The medicament cartridge 300 can be configured to receive the medicament(s) at
any suitable time, including at pre-filling and/or while coupled to the aerosol preparation
assembly 100, and can be refillable or single use/disposable. The medicament cartridge 300 can
be configured according to medicament-specific conditions to account for storage/delivery needs
of the medicament. In some embodiments, the medicament cartridge 300 can include any keying
feature that restricts the use of the medicament cartridge 300 to prespecified delivery systems,
such as the aerosol preparation assembly 100.       Additional components for handling and/or
manipulating the medicament may be formed as part of the medicament cartridge 300, such as
filters, for example. Further, in some embodiments, the medicament cartridge 300 can include a
machine-readable label and/or electronic circuit system for communication with the controller
600 for monitoring the medicament levels in the medicament cartridge, for controlling
access/delivery of the medicament, and/or the like.
[1077]       The gas source 400 can provide airflow in a manner appropriate for the aerosol
preparation assembly 100 (i.e., to produce aerosolized medicaments     (ADEL)  having the desired
characteristics). In other words, the gas source 400 can, in some embodiments, be tuned to the
specifications of input requirements of the aerosol preparation assembly 100. For example, in
some embodiments, the gas source 400 can be operated to produce steady, laminar flow, while in
other embodiments, the gas source can produce flow having periodic changes in local velocity,
pressure, and/or any suitable flow parameter. Although shown here as a single gas source 400
                                              15

    WO 2013/163517                                                           PCT/US2013/038368
for simplicity, it is understood to represent multiple gas sources operable to delivery one or more
gases, each operating in a similar manner as described here.      The gas source 400 can be of any
suitable form, such as a pump, a hospital supply system, a gas tank (e.g. most medical gas
supplies), and/or the like. In some embodiments, the gas source need not be humidified and/or
otherwise controlled for humidity, temperature, and/or the like.        Additional components for
handling and/or manipulating the gas may be formed as part of the gas source 400, such as
pumps, connecting lines, compliance chambers, filters, valves, regulators, pressure gauges,
and/or the like. Further, in some embodiments, the gas source 400 can include a machine
readable   label    and/or electronic circuit    system (e.g. a hydraulic      control   system) for
communication with the controller 600 for monitoring gas levels in the gas source, for
controlling access/delivery of the gas, for controlling gas flow parameters, and/or the like.
[1078]      The cannula assembly 500 is configured to deliver the aerosolized medicament        ADEL
from the aerosol preparation assembly 100 to nares of patient, and can be configured to be
removably coupled and/or operatively coupled to the aerosol preparation assembly 100. In some
embodiments, the cannula assembly 500 includes at least a face piece tube 530, and can
additionally include a face piece 560. In other words, in some embodiments, the tube 530 can
suffice for patient delivery of the aerosolized medicament. The tube 530 can be appropriately
sized and designed for operation with the aerosol preparation assembly 100 and per the desired
delivery characteristics of the aerosolized medicament. For example, it may be desired that the
tube 530 be of a certain minimum rigidity to prevent excessive bending that could, in turn, affect
flow characteristics detrimentally. In some embodiments, additional structures may be formed
within the tube, such as one way valves that prevent condensed liquids/particles from flowing
into the patient's nostrils, but permit backflow of the condensed liquids/particles into the aerosol
preparation assembly 100, for example. As another example, and as will be explained in more
detail later, one or more filtering structures that change the particle size distribution of the
aerosolized medicament can also be present in the tube 530.
[1079]      The face piece 560 can be removably coupled and/or operatively coupled to the tube
530, and can be appropriately sized and designed per the desired delivery characteristics of the
aerosolized medicament. As generally discussed above for the tube 530, the face piece 560 can
constitute filters, valves, and/or the like for modifying flow characteristics and or the aerosolized
medicament.
[1080]      In some embodiments, the face piece 560 can have a separate outlet/prong for
delivering the aerosolized medicament for each nasal cannula of the patient.                 In some
                                                 16

    WO 2013/163517                                                       PCT/US2013/038368
embodiments, the face piece 560 can be further configured for ease and comfort of use, by
including features such as claspers, sticky pads, and/or the like to hold the face piece 560 in
position on the nose of the patient.
[1081]       The controller 600 can be configured for monitoring, control, and/or modulating any
of the functionality of the aerosol preparation assembly 100, the medicament cartridge 300, the
gas source 400, and/or any other component associated with the system 10.                In some
embodiments, the controller 600 can include at least a processor and a memory.            In some
embodiments, the controller 600 can receive signal inputs and produce outputs to control and/or
operate the system 10, as described herein.
[1082]     The memory can be any suitable computer memory. For example, the memory can
be random-access memory (RAM), read-only memory (ROM), flash memory, erasable
programmable read-only memory (EPROM), electrically erasable programmable read-only
memory (EEPROM), and/or other suitable memory. In some embodiments, the memory can
be configured to store code representing processor instructions for execution by the processor
and/or store data received from any device(s) operatively coupled to the processor.
[1083]     The processor can be any suitable processor capable of executing computer
instructions. Each module in the processor can be any combination of hardware-based module
(e.g., a field-programmable gate array (FPGA), an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC),
a digital signal processor (DSP) and/or software-based module (e.g., a module of computer code
stored in memory and/or executed at the processor) configured to execute a specific function of
the system 10. The processor can be a microcontroller, a FPGA, an ASIC, or any other suitable
processor configured to run and/or execute the modules. The processor and modules of the
processor can be configured to collectively execute the methods described herein, and/or to
implements the apparatuses described herein.
[1084]       In use, the aerosol preparation assembly 10 can produce an outlet aerosol having the
desired particle size distribution to accommodate the methods of delivery and/or treatment
described herein. For example, as discussed below, the delivery of aerosols via nasal cannulas
over extended periods of time (e.g., greater than one half hour) can result in undesirable rainout
and/or sputtering. Thus, in some embodiments, the aerosol preparation assembly 100 is matched
to (configured to operate cooperatively with) the nasal cannula assembly 500. For example, in
some embodiments, the nasal cannula assembly 500 can be configured such that a flow
therethrough having a VMD of not greater than approximately 1.9 gm will result in minimal
rainout and/or sputtering. Accordingly, in such embodiments, the aerosol preparation assembly
                                                17

    WO 2013/163517                                                               PCT/US2013/038368
100 can be configured to receive an input aerosol        AIN   (see e.g., FIG. 2) and produce an outlet
aerosol   AOUT   (see e.g., FIG. 2) having a VMD of not greater than approximately 1.9 gin. In this
manner the aerosol delivery system 10 can effectively perform the methods described herein.
[1085]        Moreover, in some embodiments, the particle size distribution of the delivered
aerosol   ADEL    is controlled to minimize the amount of aerosol impaction in the nasal passages
(i.e., the filtering of particles via the nose). Similarly stated, in some embodiments, the aerosol
delivery system 10 (and any of the systems shown and described herein) is configured to produce
the delivered aerosol        ADEL  having a desired particle size (e.g., VMD) to enable and/or
accommodate the methods described herein. More particularly, it is known that the nose is an
effective filter for particles that are greater than approximately 2-3 gin. Thus, transnasal delivery
of aerosols having a VMD of, for example, 6 gin, will result in low rates of deposition into the
lower airways.        Accordingly, in addition to configuring the aerosol delivery system 10 to
produce a flow of aerosol in which rainout and/or sputtering is minimized, in some
embodiments, the delivery system 10 is also configured to produce an aerosol having a particle
size within a predetermined range (e.g., 1.4 gm) to accommodate a particular method of
treatment and/or to deliver a medicament having a particular composition.
[1086]         In some embodiments, the aerosol preparation assembly 100 can be formed as
illustrated in FIG. 2.       As shown, the aerosol preparation assembly 100 includes an aerosol
generator 110, an entrainment chamber 120, a nozzle 170, and a particle selection chamber 200.
[1087]        The entrainment chamber 120 defines an entrainment volume 142 for generating
entrained aerosol, as described in more detail herein.             The entrainment chamber 120 also
includes a gas inlet port 121, an aerosol inlet port 111, and an outlet port 130. The gas inlet port
121 is configured to fluidically couple the gas source 400 to the entrainment volume 142 defined
by sidewalls 140. The entrainment chamber 120 is configured such that a velocity                VENT  of a
flow of a gas     GENT  within the entrainment volume 142 is less than a velocity VIN of the flow of
the gas   GIN   within the gas inlet port 121. The aerosol inlet port 111 is configured to receive an
inlet aerosol    AIN   produced by the aerosol generator 110.         The entrainment chamber 120 is
configured such that at least a portion of the inlet aerosol    AIN  is entrained into the flow of the gas
GENT to   produce an entrained aerosol    AENT  at the outlet port 130.
[1088]        As noted, in some embodiments, the entrainment chamber 120 can be designed and/or
otherwise configured to produce a desired entrainment velocity             VENT   within the entrainment
volume 142 that promotes entrainment of the gas           GIN   by the aerosol AIN.     As discussed, the
desired velocity     VENT   is lower than the input velocity VIN at the gas inlet port 121.       Without

being bound by any particular theory or embodiment, it can generally be understood that
lowering gas velocity over the same path length of interaction can increase contact time between
the gas  GIN   and the aerosol   AIN  thereby increasing the probability, and hence the efficiency, of
entrainment of the gas    GIN.   Moreover, in some embodiments, one or more recirculation zones or
regions (not shown) can be formed within the entrainment volume 142 that can be configured to
permit the gas   GIN  and the aerosol   AIN to cycle one or more times prior to exiting the entrainment
chamber 120. In this manner, the path length of interaction can be increased, thereby increasing
contact time between the gas       GIN   and the aerosol    AIN, thereby increasing the probability, and
hence the efficiency, of entrainment of the gas       GIN.
[1089]       Recirculation may be enhanced by any suitable mechanism and/or flow structure. In
some embodiments, a recirculation zone can be produced by sudden expansion of the inlet gas
GIN  produced by the side walls 140 of the entrainment chamber 120 and/or the gas inlet port 121.
In some embodiments, the gas inlet port 121 can be configured such that an expansion ratio of
the gas  GIN  entering the entrainment volume 142 is greater than one. In other words, the volume
of the gas  GIN  generally increases upon entering the entrainment volume 142, thereby resulting in
lowered velocity. In some embodiments, the expansion ratio associated with the gas inlet port
121 is at least 1.1, at least 1.2, at least 1.3, at least 1.4, at least 1.5, at least 2, at least 2.5, at least
3, at least 3.5, at least 4, at least 4.5, at least 5, at least 6, at least 7, at least 8, at least 8, at least
10, and all values in between.
[1090]       In some embodiments, the entrainment chamber                    120    can further include a
recirculation port (not shown) configured to receive a rained out portion of the entrained aerosol
AENT   that is fluidically coupled to the aerosol generator 110 to recycle the rained out portion to
the aerosol generator for reuse.
[1091]       The aerosol generator 110 can be any suitable device and/or mechanism for aerosol
generation as generally listed earlier, including, but not limited to, an aerosol spray (similar to
commonly used aerosol cans), an atomic nozzle (such as those based on the Venturi effect), any
type of nebulizer suitable for medicament delivery (mechanical, electrical, a current jet
nebulizer, an ultrasonic nebulizer, a vibrating mesh nebulizer etc.), an electrospray, a vibrating
orifice aerosol generator (VOAG), and/or the like. In some embodiments, the aerosol generator
110 generally includes a reservoir containing the liquid/gas of entrainment, a plurality of
sidewalls defining an inlet opening, and optionally a surface associated with aerosol generation,
such as a mesh. In some embodiments, the aerosol generator 110 can further be configured to
received rained out portions of the aerosol (described further later) from the entrainment
                                                    19

    WO 2013/163517                                                          PCT/US2013/038368
chamber 120 and the particle selection chamber 200 via a recycle port. In some embodiments,
the aerosol generator 110 can have a cartridge in fluid communication therewith, where the
cartridge contains a medicament from which the inlet aerosol       AIN  is produced by the aerosol
generator 110, as described earlier.
[1092]       The nozzle 170 is in fluidic communication with the outlet port 130 of the
entrainment chamber 120, and is configured to provide a flow path for the entrained aerosol
AENT   from the entrainment chamber 120 into the particle selection chamber 200, and to
accelerate the entrained aerosol    AENT.  In some embodiments, the nozzle 170 can be removably
coupled to the entrainment chamber 120 and/or the particle selection chamber 200.           In other
embodiments, the nozzle is monolithically constructed with at least one of the entrainment
chamber 120 or the particle selection chamber 200. The nozzle 170 can generally include a first
end portion 171 coupled to the entrainment chamber 120 to receive the entrained aerosol      AENT, a
second end portion coupled to the particle selection chamber 200 to deliver the entrained aerosol
AENT,  and a flow area 173 in between. In some embodiments, the second end portion can extend
into the selection volume 242. The nozzle 170 can be of any suitable length and design for
producing desired flow characteristics. In some embodiments, the first end portion 171 can have
a larger opening (e.g. a relatively larger diameter) than an opening of the second end portion 172
(e.g. a relatively smaller diameter).        Although described here as circular openings for the
simplicity of explanation, it is understood that other shapes of these openingswould also be
suitable. In some embodiments, the diameter of the opening of the first end portion 171 and the
diameter of the opening of the second end portion 172 are each independently selected from
about 0.1 mm, about 0.5mm, about 1mm, about 1.5mm, about 2mm, about 2.5mm, about 3mm,
about 3.5mm about 4mm, about 4.5mm, about 5mm, about 6mm, about 7mm, about 8mm, about
9mm about 10mm, and all values in between.
[1093]      The particle selection chamber 200 is configured for particle selection.           More
particularly, the particle selection chamber 200 and nozzle 170 are collectively configured such
that a volumetric median diameter (VMD) of the outlet aerosol      AOUT   is less than a VMD of the
inlet aerosol AIN. In some embodiments, the entrainment chamber 120 and the particle selection
chamber 200 can be monolithically constructed as a single unit, while in other embodiments,
they can be separably coupled. In some embodiments, the particle selection chamber 200 can
include a recirculation port (not shown) configured to receive a rained out portion of the
entrained aerosol   AENT   that is fluidically coupled to the aerosol generator 110 to recycle the
rained out portion to the aerosol generator for reuse.

    WO 2013/163517                                                            PCT/US2013/038368
[1094]       The particle selection chamber 200 includes a cannula coupling port 230 that is
configured to be coupled to a nasal cannula, such as the nasal cannula assembly 500.               The
particle selection chamber 200 can be configured to receive the entrained aerosol       AENT  from the
nozzle 170 and produce an outlet aerosol flow      AOUT.  The particle selection chamber includes an
inlet port 221, a plurality of sidewalls 240 defining a selection volume 242, and a flow path 243
within the selection volume 242. The flow path 243 can be any straight or tortuous path that
generates an output aerosol   AOUT   at the cannula coupling port 230 from the input aerosol     AIN at
the inlet port 221 that has desired characteristics of flow and composition.
[1095]       The particle selection chamber 200 and nozzle 170 are collectively configured such
that a VMD of the outlet aerosol      AOUT   is less than a volumetric median diameter of the inlet
aerosol   AIN.   In other words, the particle selection chamber 200 is configured to alter the
diameter distribution of the inlet aerosol AIN, by any suitable mechanism. In some embodiments,
the particle selection chamber 200 is configured such that the VMD of the outlet aerosol        AOUT is
substantially independent of the VMD of the inlet aerosol     AIN.  In other words, the flow path 243
can be designed such that no matter the characteristics of the inlet aerosol    AIN, the outlet aerosol
AOUT   always has the desired, relatively narrower particle size characteristics (e.g., VMD). For
example, in some embodiments, the VMD of the inlet aerosol         AIN  is about 3 microns, is about 4
microns, is about 5 microns, is about 6 microns, is about 7 microns, is about 8 microns, is about
9 microns, is about 10 microns, and all values in between; and the VMD of the outlet aerosol
AOUT   is about 0.5 microns, is about 1 micron, is about 1.1 microns, is about 1.2 microns, is about
1.3 microns, is about 1.4 microns, is about 1.5 microns, is about 1.6 microns, is about 1.7
microns, is about 1.8 microns, is about 1.9 microns, is about 2 microns, is about 2.5 microns,
and all values in between.
[1096]       Hence, in some embodiments, the flow path 243 includes one or more mechanisms
that affect and/or adjust the particle size diameter distribution of the inlet aerosol   AIN.  In some
embodiments, the flow path 243 can include an obstructive structure that alters a path of inertial
flow of the inlet aerosol AIN. Larger particles will have a greater tendency to be stopped by the
obstructive structure due to inertia than the smaller particles, which in turn will have a greater
tendency to flow around the inertial structure. For example, the obstructive structure can be a
baffle, and the nozzle 170 and the baffle can be configured such that a portion of the inlet aerosol
AIN  comprising larger particles tends to impinge on the baffle, while another portion of the inlet
aerosol   AIN comprising smaller particles tends to flow around the baffle.

    WO 2013/163517                                                         PCT/US2013/038368
[1097]      In some embodiments, the cannula coupling port 230 includes a cannula opening, a
cannula nozzle and a coupling portion. The cannula nozzle can include an inner wall having a
flow path that defines an effective flow area which is substantially the same as an effective flow
area of a flow path defined by an inner wall of the nasal cannula of the patient. The coupling
portion can be configured to be coupled to the nasal cannula such that the inner wall of the
cannula nozzle and the inner wall of the nasal cannula form a substantially continuous surface.
In this manner, the interface between the nasal cannula and the cannula coupling port 230 can be
substantially free of flow obstructions, expansions and/or contractions, all of which can lead to
rainout.
[1098]      The gas source 400 and the nasal cannula assembly 500 are similar to the gas source
and nasal cannula as characterized earlier. In some embodiments, the gas source 400 can be
configured to produce the flow of a gas within the entrainment volume 142 having a periodic
variation in flow rate.
[1099]      In use, the aerosol preparation assembly of FIG. 2 is configurable for two stage
operation to produce the desired particle size range: first at the entrainment chamber 120, and
then at the particle selection chamber 200. In some embodiments, the entrainment chamber 120
can provide a substantially linear, unobstructed flow path 143 for inlet gas GIN and inlet aerosol
AIN  to generate an entrained aerosol AENT having desired characteristics for subsequent particle
selection. This can be accomplished by reducing gas velocity VIN to promote entrainment, and
then increasing it again, by virtue of the design of the nozzle 170, to convey the inlet aerosol AIN
to the particle selection chamber 200 having a velocity VIN effective to cause particle
selection/rejection when the inlet aerosol AIN impinges on an obstructive chamber in a flow path
243. The velocity VIN, as well as the design of the flow path 243 can then be 'tuned' to achieve
the desire particle selection. The outlet aerosol AOUT from the cannula coupling port 230 can be
delivered to the cannula of the patient in a reproducible manner since, by virtue of the inner wall
of the cannula nozzle and the inner wall of the nasal cannula forming a substantially continuous
surface, the desirable characteristics of the outlet aerosol can be conserved while the outlet
aerosol AOUT traverses the nasal cannula assembly 500.
[1100]      In some embodiments, a medicament cartridge 1300' can be formed as illustrated in
FIG. 3, and can, in some respects, be similar to the medicament cartridge 1300. The medicament
cartridge 1300' includes a medicament container 1310 containing a liquid medicament. The
medicament cartridge 1300' includes an interface member 1320 coupled to the medicament
container 1310 for access to the medicament, and also configured to be removably coupled to an

inlet opening 1118 defined by an aerosol generator 1110', which can be similar to the generator
110 of FIG. 2. In some embodiments, the interface member 1320 can be constructed from a
deformable material (e.g., soft plastic) configured to form a substantially fluid-tight seal with the
aerosol generator when coupled to the aerosol generator. In some embodiments, the medicament
cartridge 1300' can be formed in the proximity of a recirculation port (not shown here, as
described in more detail in FIG. 5), and the interface member 1320 can be any conduit
connecting the medicament cartridge 1300' to the aerosol generator 1110'.              For example,
although shown as being located above the aerosol generator such that gravity can assist the flow
from the cartridge into the aerosol generator, in other embodiments, the cartridge can be disposed
beside (i.e., at substantially the same height) or even below the aersol generator.          In some
embodiments, the aerosol generator 1110' can be a nebulizer.
[1101]       The medicament cartridge 1300' also includes a valve 1330 defining a liquid flow
path from the medicament container 1310 to the reservoir 1112 of the aerosol generator 1110'.
More particularly, the valve 1330 can limit and/or control the flow of the medicament from the
medicament container 1310 into the reservoir 1112.        In this manner, the medicament can be
conveyed into the aerosol generator 1110' at a rate that corresponds to the rate of delivery of the
aerosol (e.g., AOUT or ADEL) as described herein. The valve 1330 can inculde any mechanism for
controlling the flow. For example, in some embodiments, the valve 1330 can define a gas flow
path from the reservoir 1112 of the aerosol generator 1110' to limit flow of the liquid
medicament from the medicament container 1310 into the reservoir of the aerosol generator. In
some embodiments, the valve 1330 can be configured to limit a static pressure exerted by the
liquid medicament within the medicament container 1310 on a surface of the aerosol generator
(e.g., a bottom surface, mesh or the like). As discussed earlier, the medicament cartridge 1300',
and particularly the operation of the valve 1330, can be under control of a system controller, such
as the controller 1600.
[1102]       In some embodiments, a filter can be disposed within the valve 1330 and/or between
the valve 1330 and the reservoir 1112 of the aerosol generator.
[1103]       In some embodiments, an aerosol preparation assembly 2100 can be formed as
illustrated in FIG. 4. It is understood that unless explicitly stated otherwise, components of the
aerosol preparation assembly 2100 can be similar to, and/or operate in a manner similar to,
similarly named components of the aerosol preparation assembly 1100. The aerosol preparation
assembly 2100 includes an entrainment chamber 2120, a particle selection chamber 2200, and a
nasal cannula assembly 2500.

[1104]      The entrainment chamber 2120 can be similar to the entrainment chamber 1120, and
defines an entrainment volume 2141.         The entrainment chamber 2120 includes a gas inlet port
2121, an aerosol inlet port 2111, and an outlet port 2130.            The gas inlet port 2121 can be
configured to fluidically couple the gas source 2400 to the entrainment volume 2141.                 The
aerosol inlet port 2111 can be configured to receive an inlet aerosol      AIN  produced by the aerosol
generator 2110. The entrainment chamber 2120 can be configured such that at least a portion of
the inlet aerosol AIN  is entrained into a flow of a gas    GIN within the entrainment volume 2141 to
produce an entrained aerosol flow       AENT   at the outlet port 2130.     In some embodiments, the
entrainment chamber 2120 can include a recirculation port configured to receive a rained out
portion of the entrained aerosol   AENT   that is fluidically coupled to the aerosol generator 2110 to
recycle the rained out portion to the aerosol generator for reuse.
[1105]      The particle selection chamber 2200 includes a cannula coupling port 2230
configured to be coupled to a nasal cannula 2500 of the patient. The particle selection chamber
2200 can be configured to receive the entrained aerosol         AENT  from the outlet port 2130 of the
entrainment chamber 2120 and produce an outlet aerosol          AOUT.   The particle selection chamber
2200 can be further configured to extract a portion of the entrained aerosol          AENT   such that a
VMD of the outlet aerosol      AOUT  is less than a VMD of the inlet aerosol AIN. Accordingly, in
some embodiments, the particle selection chamber 2200 can include an obstructive structure
such as a baffle, where a portion of the entrained aerosol           AENT  impinges on the baffle, as
described earlier.    In some embodiments, the particle selection chamber 2120 can include a
recirculation port configured to receive a rained out portion of the entrained aerosol      AENT  that is
fluidically coupled to the aerosol generator 2110 to recycle the rained out portion to the aerosol
generator for reuse.
[1106]      In some embodiments, the entrainment chamber 2120 and the particle selection
chamber 2200 can be connected via a nozzle (not shown) as described earlier, although this is
not necessary to achieve the benefits stated herein.
[1107]      As illustrated in FIG. 4, the cannula coupling port 2230 defines an opening 2232 that
is continuous with the selection volume 2242, and that can receive the outlet aerosol          AOUT   for
delivery to the cannula assembly 2500. The cannula coupling port 2230 also includes a cannula
nozzle 2234 configured to modify characteristics of the outlet aerosol         AOUT  for delivery to the
patient.   For example, as illustrated, the cannula nozzle 2234 can serve to decrease the cross
section of the flow of the outlet aerosol       AOUT,   thereby increasing the velocity of the outlet
aerosol  AOUT  to a level sufficient to propel it through the nasal cannula assembly 2500. In this

manner, rainout due to sedimentation within the nasal cannula assembly 2500 can be minimized.
The cannula coupling port 2230 also includes a coupling portion 2236 that receives the supply
tube 2530 of the nasal cannula assembly 2500. The coupling portion 2236 is configured to be
coupled to the nasal cannula assembly 2500 such that an inner wall of the cannula nozzle and an
inner wall of the nasal cannula form a substantially continuous surface 2238. Employing the
smooth surface 2238 maintains the flow profile of the outlet aerosol       AOUT, thereby preventing
inadvertent changes in flow velocity, sudden expansions, flow impediments and the like, thereby
minimizing rainout at the transition into the cannula assembly 2500. In some embodiments, the
cannula coupling port 2230 can be magnetically coupled to the nasal cannula assembly 2500; in
other words, magnets can be present in each of the cannula coupling port 2230 (e.g. in the
coupling portion 2236) and the cannula assembly 2500 (e.g. at an end of the supply tube 2530),
such that in a mating position, attraction between one set of opposing poles of the magnets can
aid, guide, lock, align, and/or otherwise effect the coupling of the nasal cannula assembly 2500
into the cannula coupling port 2230 to yield the continuous surface 2238.
[1108]       Aspects of this design hence overcome shortcomings in the prior art that employ
other coupling means providing discontinuities at the final entry point for aerosolized
medicament into a nasal cannula delivery assembly. For example, the use of barbed fittings in
the prior art was observed to cause sudden expansion of the flow profile of the outlet aerosol
AOUT.
[1109]       In some embodiments, an aerosol preparation assembly 3100 can be formed as
illustrated in FIG. 5. It is understood that unless explicitly stated otherwise, components of the
aerosol preparation assembly 3100 can be similar to, and/or operate in a manner similar to,
similarly named components of the aerosol preparation assembly 1100 and/or the aerosol
preparation assembly 2100. The aerosol preparation assembly 3100 includes an entrainment
chamber 3120 and a particle selection chamber 3200.
[1110]       The entrainment chamber 3120 can define an entrainment volume 3140 by virtue of
the sidewalls from which the entrainment chamber 3120 is constructed.              The entrainment
chamber 3120 can include a gas inlet port 3121, an aerosol inlet port 3111, an outlet port 3130
and a first recirculation port 3150. The gas inlet port 3121 is configured to fluidically couple the
gas source 3400 to the entrainment volume 3140. The aerosol inlet port 3111 is configured to

GIN  to generate entrained aerosol AENT.

    WO 2013/163517                                                                PCT/US2013/038368
[1111]       Aspects of some embodiments can account for the possibility that some rain out and
initial particle selection in the entrainment chamber 3120 (e.g., due to sedimentation) will occur.
In other words, the entirety of the inlet aerosol     AIN may not be consumed to generate       AENT,  and
some will be rained out and/or precipitated. When the aerosol contains medicament, such waste
can be expensive, and is undesirable. Accordingly, the entrainment chamber 3120 is configured
such that a first portion of the inlet aerosol   AIN1 is entrained into the flow of a gas   GIN within the
entrainment volume 3140 to produce the entrained aerosol            AENT   at the outlet port 3130, and a
second portion of the inlet aerosol    AIN2,  such as may not be consumed to generate the entrained
aerosol   AENT,  is collected within the entrainment chamber 3120.            In some embodiments, the
collection of the second portion        AIN2  is precipitated and/or removed from the aerosol via
sedimentation, i.e., is gravity driven.
[1112]       A first recirculation port 3150 is configured to receive and/or otherwise collect the
second portion    AIN2.  The first recirculation port 3150 can be designed for optimal collection of
the second portion     AIN2.  The first recirculation port 3150 is fluidically coupled to the aerosol
generator 3110 via a first recirculation pathway 3160.                In some embodiments, the first
recirculation port 3150 may be coupled to the first recirculation pathway 3160 in a manner
similar to how (see FIG. 4) the cannula coupling port 2230 is coupled to the assembly 2500. In
other words, a substantially smooth and continuous surface may be formed that prevents
backflow or otherwise retards the collection of the second portion        AIN2.
[1113]       The particle selection chamber 3200 includes a cannula coupling port 3230
configured to be coupled to a nasal cannula of the patient, and can be similar to the cannula
couple port 2230 in FIG. 4. The particle selection chamber 3200 is configured to receive the
entrained aerosol    AENT  from the outlet port 3130 of the entrainment chamber 3120 and produce
an outlet aerosol  AOUT1  to be transmitted to the nasal cannula of the patient.
[1114]       As discussed earlier, particle selection, such as by using an obstructive structure,
necessarily results in particle rejection and/or removal from the aerosol and/or flow through the
particle selection chamber 3200. When the particles contain medicament, outright disposal of
the portion that is rejected is wasteful, and aspects of some embodiments are operable to recover
the disposed portions for recycling and aerosolization.             Accordingly, the particle selection
chamber 3200 is configured to extract a portion of the entrained aerosol         AOUT2  from the entrained
aerosol  AENT   such that a VMD of the outlet aerosol     AOUT1  is less than a VMD of the inlet aerosol
AIN. A second recirculation port 3250 can be configured to receive the extracted portion            AOUT2,
The second recirculation port 3250 is fluidically coupled to the aerosol generator 3110 via a
                                                   26

    WO 2013/163517                                                          PCT/US2013/038368
second recirculation pathway 3260. In some embodiments, the second recirculation port 3250
may be coupled to the second recirculation pathway 3260 in a manner similar to how the cannula
coupling port 2230 is coupled to the assembly 2500 (see e.g., FIG. 4).            In other words, a
substantially smooth and continuous surface may be formed that prevents backflow or otherwise
retards the collection of the second portion AOUT2.
[1115]       As illustrated in FIG. 5, the first circulation pathway 3160 and the second circulation
pathway 3260 can be recombined prior to being coupled to the aerosol generator 3110 via a
single return port 3116. However, it is understood that the first circulation pathway 3160 and the
second circulation pathway 3260 can be independently provided to the aerosol generator 3110
via separate ports (not shown). In some embodiments, as described earlier for FIG. 3, the first
recirculation port 3150 and/or the second circulation pathway 3260 can drain directly into a
medicament cartridge of the types shown and described herein. In some embodiments, at least
one of the first circulation pathway 3160 and the second circulation pathway 3260 lies outside
and/or otherwise excludes the entrainment chamber 3120, for each of manipulation.                For
example, at least one of the first circulation pathway 3160 and the second circulation pathway
3260 can include valves operably manually and/or by the controller 1600 to continuously or
periodically remove the AIN2 and AOUT2 streams.
[1116]       Further, aspects of some embodiments are operable to perform one or more
operations on the AIN2 and/or AOUT2 streams prior to reintroduction into the aerosol generator
3110. For example, liquid and/or medicament may be added to modify the concentration of the
recycled stream(s) to match or be within a tolerance of the contents of the reservoir of the aerosol
generator 3110.      In some embodiments, the circulation pathway(s) can include one or more
filters for removing any process contaminants that can be drained off. In some embodiments, a
parameter associated with the reintroduced stream(s) can be monitored, such as level of
medicament, etc.
[1117]       FIGS. 6-8 show an aerosol preparation assembly 1100, according to an embodiment.
The aerosol preparation assembly 1100 can be coupled to a gas source 1400 of pulsatile or non
pulsatile gas flow, and a nasal cannula (not shown) as a part of an overall aerosol delivery system
of the types shown and described herein. The aerosol preparation assembly 1100 includes an
entrainment chamber 1120 and a particle selection chamber 1200. The entrainment chamber
1120 includes an aerosol generator 1110, an aerosol inlet port 1111, an entrainment fluid inlet
port 1121, an entrainment fluid outlet 1130, and a rainout collection outlet or drain 1150. The
entrainment fluid outlet 1130 includes a first end 1171 and a second end 1172. The entrainment
                                                  27

    WO 2013/163517                                                       PCT/US2013/038368
chamber 1120 defines a fluid pathway 1143, which is generally formed by any suitable structure
that directs the flow of fluid through the entrainment chamber 1120.
[1118]       The particle selection chamber 1200 includes an impaction baffle 1246, a particle
selection chamber outlet 1230 and a rainout collection outlet or drain 1250. The drain 1250 can
be suitably formed anywhere in the particle selection chamber 1200, including before or after
(i.e., upstream or downstream of) the baffle 1246. The particle selection chamber 1200 defines a
fluid pathway 1243, which is generally formed by any suitable structure that directs the flow of
fluid through the particle selection chamber 1200.       The outlet 1230 may be connected to a
cannula (not shown), such as a nasal cannula for delivering aerosol to a subject. As shown in
FIG. 8, the aerosol preparation assembly 1100 may be connected to a gas source 1400 including
a pump and an optional compliance chamber.
[1119]       The aerosol generator 1110 or any of the aerosol generators described herein can be
any suitable nebulizer unit or other device for producing an aerosol or fine spray containing
droplets.    For example, the aerosol generator 1110 can be a nebulizer unit, such as a jet
nebulizer, ultrasonic nebulizer or vibrating mesh nebulizer that is configured to provide an
aerosol into the entrainment chamber 1120.         Commercially available nebulizers suitable for
inclusion in the entrainment chamber 1120 include vibrating mesh nebulizers from Aerogen
Aeroneb Lab, Pro and Solo, Pari eFlow vibrating mesh technologies, Omron's vibrating horn
technologies, vibrating mesh or ultrasonic technologies from Philips, ActivAero and other
manufacturers.      In some embodiments, the aerosol generator 1110 and any of the aerosol
generators disclosed herein can include a spray nozzle unit, such as any of the spray nozzle units
produced by Medspray, including spray nozzles including a silicon micromachined nozzle chip.
The inlet port 1121 may be connected to a gas source 1400, such as an air or other gas source for
providing an entrainment gas that flows into the entrainment chamber 1120 and through the
particle selection chamber 1200 generally along the fluid pathways 1143, 1243. The entrainment
gas moves generally along the fluid pathways 1143, 1243 and carries the aerosol from the
aerosol generator 1110 through the port 1130, around the baffle 1246 and out of the selection
chamber outlet port 1230. As shown in FIGS. 9-10, the baffle 1246 is held in position by
supports 1246A.
[1120]       In some embodiments, the gas source 1400 includes a pump that produces a gas flow
entraining the aerosol that is characterized by a non-pulsatile and/or substantially steady-state
flow. The source of such a non-pulsatile flow pulsatile flow can be any suitable pump, such as a
diaphragm pump, a peristaltic pump or a rotary vane pump. The pump is disposed upstream of
                                                28

   WO 2013/163517                                                           PCT/US2013/038368
an entrainment chamber, thereby producing a positive pressure through the aerosol preparation
assembly 1100. In some embodiments, the gas source 1400 can include a compliance chamber
(see e.g., FIG. 8) to produce an air source to the inlet 1121 that has a reduced amount of pressure
or flow oscillations from the pump of the gas source 1400. The compliance chamber may be a
chamber of a size sufficient to reduce any flow oscillations from the pump.           The optional
compliance chamber may be used to provide reproducible flows of aerosol of a given particle
size with adequate emitted volumes.          In other embodiments, the source of gas can be a
compressed gas container.       For example, in such embodiments, the entrainment fluid can be
dehumidified and/or dried compressed air, and/or oxygen (including low humidity oxygen, high
humidity oxygen, or oxygen where the humidity levels are not controlled or manipulated). In
some embodiments, the source of gas is not temperature-controlled.
[1121]       In use, the aerosol generated by the generator 1110 may produce particles of a wide
range of particle sizes. When the entrainment gas carries the aerosol though the port 1130, the
velocity of the gas increases because the first end 1171 of the outlet 1130 has a cross-sectional
area that is larger than the cross-sectional area of the second end 1172. Such narrowing produces
a nozzle or a jet, which accelerates the movement of the aerosol particles towards the baffle. The
diameter   # of the second end 1172 can be tuned and/or selected to achieve a desired velocity of
aerosol particles, and can consequently increase or decrease the impaction of the aerosol particles
on the baffle. The entrainment gas and aerosol is therefore directed toward the baffle 1246 with
an increased velocity as compared to the velocity of the flow through the entrainment chamber
1120.    For outlet flow rates between 0.5 and 5 L/min, the nozzle diameter         # is preferably
between 0.5 to 5 mm in diameter. Nozzle diameters that are too small may prevent efficient
cleaning of the device, and nozzle diameters that are too large may require too high an airflow
for effective particle acceleration and/or selection.
[1122]       As shown in FIGS. 6-8, the nozzle 1170 can be separately constructed from and later
assembled into the entrainment chamber 1120 and/or the particle selection chamber 1200. This
arrangement can allow an aerosol preparation assembly (e.g., the aerosol preparation assembly
1100) to be equipped with multiple different nozzles (e.g., having different sizes and/or
performance characteristics) to allow the system to be tuned and/or optimized to achieve a
desired output. Similarly stated, in some embodiments, a kit can include an aerosol preparation
assembly and a set of nozzles, wherein each nozzle has a different size. In other embodiments,
however, the nozzle can be monolithically constructed with the entrainment chamber 1120
and/or the particle selection chamber 1200.
                                                 29

    WO 2013/163517                                                          PCT/US2013/038368
[1123]      The baffle 1246 is sized and configured in cooperation with the nozzle 1170 such that
larger aerosol particles will generally not be able to pass around the baffle 1246 when the
entrainment gas and aerosol flows into the particle selection chamber 1200.           Accordingly,
smaller aerosol particles may pass around the baffle 1246 such that the resulting aerosol particles
that pass out of the outlet 1230 and into a nasal cannula are generally smaller than the aerosol
particles in the entrainment chamber 1120. Although the baffle 1246 is shown as being circular
and/or disc-shaped, in other embodiments, baffles can be spherical, triangular, rectangular,
pentagonal, hexagonal, 6+n-gonal where n > 1. The baffle 1246 can be mounted in cruciform or
other suitable fashion. As described in more detail below, modifications to the nozzle diameter,
flow rate and baffle dimensions may be interrelated and can each contribute to the resulting
aerosol and particle size distribution produced.
[1124]      In some embodiments, the volumetric median diameter (VMD) of the aerosol
particles exiting the particle selection chamber (e.g., the outlet aerosol) is between 1 and 4 gm,
and the percentage of the particles above 4 gm is less than 5%, less than 2% or less than 1% of
the total particle volume emitted from the particle selection chamber 1200 into the cannula. The
flow rate entering the inlet 1121 may be between 0.5 L/min to 5 L/min, and more preferably
between 1 and 3 L/min.
[1125]      In some embodiments, the aerosol preparation assembly 1100 can be configured to
produce an outlet aerosol having the desired particle size distribution to accommodate the
methods of delivery and/or treatment described herein. For example, as discussed below, the
delivery of aerosols via nasal cannulas over extended periods of time (e.g., greater than one half
hour) can result in undesirable rainout and/or sputtering. Thus, in some embodiments, a delivery
system (e.g., the aerosol delivery system 10 shown and described with respect to FIG. 1)
includes an aerosol preparation assembly (e.g., the assembly 1100) that is matched to the nasal
cannula included with the aerosol delivery system. For example, in some embodiments, a nasal
cannula can be configured such that a flow therethrough having a VMD of not greater than
approximately 1.9 gm will result in minimal rainout and/or sputtering. Accordingly, in such
embodiments, an aerosol preparation assembly (such as the aerosol preparation assembly 1100)
can be configured to receive an input aerosol and produce an outlet aerosol having the desired
particle size distribution to accommodate delivery via a nasal cannula.
[1126]      Moreover, the aerosol preparation assemblies described herein (e.g., the assembly
1100 can be configured to produce an aerosol having a particle size within a predetermined range
(e.g., VMD of 1.4 gm) to accommodate a particular method of treatment and/or to deliver a
                                               30

    WO 2013/163517                                                          PCT/US2013/038368
medicament having a particular composition. As described herein, certain compositions (e.g.,
7% hypertonic saline) are formulated to be transnasally delivered in an aerosol form having a
predetermined particle size and/or particle size distribution to accommodate high deposition
efficiency in a particular region of the airway. Accordingly, in some embodiments, the aerosol
preparation assembly 1100 can be configured to reduce the volumetric median diameter (VMD)
of the inlet aerosol (i.e., the aerosol out of the nebulizer 1110) from about 6 pim to less than about
2 imas the aerosol exits the particle selection chamber outlet 1230 and into, for example, a nasal
cannula. Similarly stated, the percentage of particles larger than 3 to 4 im may be decreased
and/or removed by the entrainment chamber 1120 and/or the particle selection chamber 1200.
[1127]       FIGS. 11-13 show the particle size distribution comparing an inlet aerosol (e.g.,    AIN)
to the aerosol output (e.g., AOUT) from the aerosol preparation assembly 1100.               The data
presented in FIGS. 11-13 is a representative particle size distribution measured by laser
diffraction instrument (Spraytec, Malvern Instruments Ltd) for the aerosol preparation assembly
1100, in which the aerosol generator 1110 is an Aerogen Aeroneb TM nebulizer (the Aeroneb T M
Lab nebulizer was utilized to generate the nebulizer-only data shown in FIG. 11, and the
Aeroneb T M Pro nebulizer was utilized to generate the data shown in FIGS. 12 and 13). The tests
were conducted using 7% hypertonic saline solution, and for those data presented for the aerosol
preparation assembly 1100, at a flow rate of two L/min. The entrainment air was maintained at
approximately 20'C and 50% relative humidity.
[1128]       As shown in FIG. 11, the volumetric mean diameter (VMD) of aerosol produced by
the nebulizer only (e.g., the inlet aerosol AIN) was 4.2 gin. Such an aerosol has a large percentage
of volume-normalized particles exceeding 3 to 4 gin.              An aerosol of such particle size
distribution may be difficult to convey via a nasal cannula because the larger particles are likely
to impact, and/or gravitationally sediment during the course of the travel through the length of
the nasal cannula. The resulting rainout may cause discomfort to the patient when such rainout
liquid droplets reach the exit points of the nasal cannula and are potentially inhaled by the patient
(i.e., sputtering). Moreover, as discussed herein, an aerosol having a particle size (e.g., VMD)
greater than the range of 2-3 gm is not a good candidate for transnasal delivery, due to the
impaction / loss within the nasal passages.
[1129]       The data shown in FIG. 12 was produced using the aerosol preparation assembly
1100, as shown in FIG. 8. As discussed herein, the particle selection chamber 1200 allowed for
control of the particle sizes exiting the outlet 1230 and consequently entering the nasal cannula.
Some of the factors that may allow for tuning or controlling the particle size selection are the
                                                  31

    WO 2013/163517                                                         PCT/US2013/038368
overall flow rate and the diameter of the inertial impactor nozzle 1170. For this test, the particle
selection chamber 1200 was equipped with a nozzle having a diameter <| of 2.5 mm, and the gas
source was coupled to a compliance chamber providing non-oscillating output of 2L/min, 7%
(w/v) NaCl solution, ~20'C and 50% relative humidity.            As shown in FIG. 12, under such
conditions, the particle selection chamber 1200 produced a particle size distribution having a
VMD of 1.9 gm and minimal percentage of the particles larger than 4 gm. As shown in FIG. 14,
under the same conditions, the device 10 according to an embodiment equipped with 3.5 mm
nozzle generated aerosol with VMD of 3.1 gm and a larger percentage of particles above 4 gm.
Accordingly, the particle selection chamber 1200 can be tuned, optimized and/or configured to
produce a desired particle size distribution and/or VMD that corresponds to a particular
medicament (e.g., osmolyte level) for effectiveness in treating a particular indication and/or
region of the airway.
[1130]       In addition to reducing the particle size (e.g., VMD) of the inlet aerosol (e.g., AIN) to
a desired output particle size (e.g., AOUT), in some embodiments, the particle selection chamber
1200 and the nozzle 1170 are collectively configured such that the volumetric median diameter
of the outlet aerosol flow   AOUT  produced is substantially independent of the volumetric median
diameter of the inlet aerosol  AIN.  More particularly, in some embodiments, the particle selection
chamber 1200 and the nozzle 1170 are collectively configured such that the volumetric median
diameter of the outlet aerosol flow produced is between approximately one micron and
approximately two microns when the volumetric median diameter of the inlet aerosol is within a
range of between approximately four microns and approximately seven microns. Accordingly,
in some embodiments, an aerosol preparation assembly 1100 can receive aerosol input from a
variety of different aerosol generators, and maintain a substantially constant output.           Such
aerosol generators can include, for example, vibrating mesh nebulizers, jet nebulizers and
ultrasonic nebulizers. Any suitable aerosol generator may be used, including, but not limited to,
nebulizers based on vibrating mesh technologies from Aerogen Aeroneb TM Lab, Pro and Solo,
Pari eFlowTM vibrating mesh technologies, vibrating horn technologies by Omron TM, vibrating
mesh or ultrasonic technologies from Philips and other manufacturers. FIGS. 14A-C are graphs
illustrating an ability of aerosol preparation assembly 1100 to produce an aerosol output with
stable particle size regardless of the input into such device from an aerosol generator.
[1131]       The removal of a portion of the inlet aerosol via the aerosol preparation assembly
1100, as described above, also necessarily results in a decrease in the rate of delivery of the
therapeutic agent. In particular, because a large amount of aerosol volume (and therefore mass)
is contained in the large particles, the removal of large particles above certain size leads to
                                                 32

    WO 2013/163517                                                      PCT/US2013/038368
decrease in the rate of aerosol emission (gl/min) and the rate of emission for the therapeutic
agent contained in aerosol (mg/min). Table 1 displays the effect of removing large particles
produced by Aerogen Aeroneb Pro nebulizer with 7% hypertonic saline drug product by a
aerosol preparation assembly 1100 of an embodiment.          While 75% of volume normalized
particles had size above 4 gm for the standalone nebulizer, only 2% of volume normalized
particles exiting port 1230 of aerosol preparation assembly 1100 of an embodiment were larger
than 4 gm. Filtering out of large particles led to a decrease in the aerosol output in terms of
volume of aerosolized fluid contained in aerosol particles emitted from particle selection
chamber outlet 1230 per unit of time (gl/min). Additionally, the output of NaCl mass per unit of
time (mg/min) from particle selection chamber outlet 1230 decreased accordingly.

controlling the operation of the aerosol generator, an air pump 92, an optional compliance
chamber 94, and a HEPA filter 80 for providing filtered air flow to the entrainment chamber inlet
(i.e. similar to the gas source 400), an electronics unit 82 (similar to the controller 600) for
enclosing electronics for controlling the operations of the pump 92 and other components of the
unit 1000, power supplies 96 for providing power to various components of the delivery unit
1000 (such as the controller 84 and electronics unit 82), and a power switch 98 for turning the
delivery unit 1000 on or off.
[1133]      As illustrated in FIGS. 17A-17C, in some embodiments, a medicament cartridge
2300' can be coupled to an aerosol preparation assembly, and more particularly to an aerosol
generator (e.g., any of the aerosol generators disclosed herein). The cartridge 2300' includes a
medicament reservoir/container 2310 and a valve 2330. The reservoir 2310 defines a volume
2312 containing a medicament to be delivered.        The valve 2330 controls flow between the
reservoir 2310 and the aerosol generator. In some embodiments, the valve 2330 can be further
configured to limit head pressure on the aerosol generator. In particular, FIG. 17B shows the
valve 2330 in an open position, and FIGS. 17A, 17C shows the valve 2330 in a closed position.
In this manner, aspects of some embodiments are operable to prevent damage to the aerosol
generator, ensure desired performance of the aerosol generator or the like. In particular, in some
aerosol generators, too much column height can disrupt operation and/or damage structures for
aerosol generation.
[1134]      The medicament can be any of the medicaments listed here, and/or a combination
thereof. As discussed earlier for FIG. 3, the medicament cartridge 2300' can be removably
coupled to the aerosol generator, and thereby to the aerosol preparation assembly 1100.         The
valve 2330 can be of any suitable type rotatable between the open/closed positions illustrated in
FIGS. 17A-17B.      For example, as shown the valve includes a cross drilled portion 2340 that
forms a through passage 2350 connecting the reservoir 2310 and the aerosol generator when the
valve 2330 is in the open position. As also illustrated in FIGS. 17A-17B, the valve 2330 can
extend through the reservoir 2310 to provide a manipulation means for switching the open/closed
state of the valve.
[1135]      Any of the systems shown and described herein (e.g., the system 1000) can be
coupled to nasal cannula through which the outlet aerosol (see, e.g.,    AOUT  in FIG. 2) can be
conveyed to the patient (as the delivered aerosol, see ADEL  in FIG. 2). In some embodiments, a
nasal cannula is configured to minimize rainout and/or sputtering of the aerosolized particles. For
example, in some embodiments, a nasal cannula can be configured to minimize and/or eliminate
                                              34

   WO 2013/163517                                                          PCT/US2013/038368
sedimentation and/or impaction of the aerosol as the aerosol is conveyed therethrough. In some
embodiments, a nasal cannula and a portion of the aerosol preparation assembly (e.g., the
cannula outlet port 1230) can be configured to collectively include a substantially continuous
inner surface at the junction between the nasal cannula and the aerosol preparation assembly, as
described above with reference to FIG. 4.
[1136]      In some embodiments, delivery of an aerosol via nasal cannula over extended periods
of time (e.g., longer than 30 minutes) while minimizing rainout is performed by a delivery
system (e.g., the system 1000) that includes a nasal cannula that is matched to (i.e., that functions
cooperatively with) the aerosol preparation device (e.g., the aerosol preparation device 1110).
For example, nasal cannulas with larger diameter tubing and fewer impaction surfaces may be
used to deliver aerosols containing a larger volume of particles above 2, 3 and 4 pim,
respectively.   Conversely, nasal cannulas with smaller diameter tubing may result in a higher
velocity of the aerosol therethrough, but may also result in increased impaction. Accordingly,
smaller diameter cannulas may be more capable of conducting aerosols over extended periods of
time and at sufficient output levels where the aerosol contains a smaller volume of particles
above 2, 3, and 4 pim, respectively.     Thus, in some embodiments, a nasal cannula assembly
includes components and is sized to be tolerable to patients (e.g., having an appropriate diameter,
being configured to minimize rainout and/or sputter), while also being capable of delivering the
desired dosage.
[1137]      More specifically, in some embodiments, an inner diameter of a nasal cannula
assembly can be selected to reduce gravitational sedimentation of the aerosol particles, which
can accumulate as rainout in the cannula.       For example, sedimentation may be reduced by
decreasing the diameter of the tubing (such as the tube 1530) used in the cannula assembly,
thereby producing an increased velocity with which the aerosol travels through the nasal cannula.
Moreover, methods according to an embodiment can include increasing the airflow from 1 to 2
L/min to 3 to 4 L/min, and/or higher.
[1138]      In some embodiments, a nasal cannula assembly can be configured to reduce inertial
impaction of the aerosol particles on the side walls thereof, which can accumulate as rainout in
the cannula assembly.      For example, in some embodiments, a nasal cannula assembly can
include a bifurcation structure having a geometric shape to reduce impaction at a bifurcation
point (e.g., at the interface between the supply tubing and the face-piece tubing).          In other
embodiments, portions of a nasal cannula assembly can be constructed such that the inner
surfaces are smooth and substantially free from ridges, surface roughness or the like.
                                              35

    WO 2013/163517                                                         PCT/US2013/038368
[1139]      In some embodiments, a nasal cannula assembly can be devoid of a bifurcation joint.
For example, as illustrated in FIG. 18B, reduced rainout may be achieved, for example, by
eliminating the bifurcation junction and by using a single line of supply tubing. As shown in
FIG. 18B, a nasal cannula assembly 1700 includes supply tubing 1710, a dummy face-piece arm
1730 and nasal prongs 1740. Notably, the nasal cannula assembly 1700 does not include a
bifurcation junction, and therefore, the rainout prior to the nose prongs 1740 may be reduced. In
some embodiments, the dummy face-piece arm 1730 may be included to help secure the prongs
1740 on the patient; however, the face-piece arm 1730 may or may not be in fluid
communication with the prongs 1740. A stopper or wall (not shown) may separate the prongs
1740 from the dummy face-piece arm 1730 such that the delivered aerosol         ADEL  is prevented
from entering the dummy face-piece arm 1730.              It should be understood that, in some
embodiments, the dummy face-piece arm 1730 may be a hollow tube fluidly connected to the
prongs 1740 and/or provide a drainage conduit for removing rainout and/or sputter.
[1140]      In some embodiments, rainout and/or sputtering may be reduced by using two
separate supply lines. As illustrated in FIG. 18C, a nasal cannula assembly 1800 includes two
separate supply lines 1810A, 1810B that are connected to respective ends of the nasal prongs
1840. Accordingly, a bifurcation junction from a single supply tubing line is eliminated, and two
separate inputs to the nasal prongs 1840 are provided.         An exit from the particle selection
chamber 1230 (see, e.g., FIG. 8) can be modified to include two outputs to accommodate such
dual supply lines. Furthermore, two independent particle selection chambers connected to single
or two independent aerosol entrainment chambers can be used to provide aerosol supply into the
dual cannula supply tubing lines.      Furthermore, two or more complete aerosol preparation
assembly systems (nebulizer, entrainment chamber and particle selection chamber) can be used
to feed into the supply lines. Such an approach may also be used to increase the output from the
prongs of the nasal cannula assembly 1800.
[1141]      As shown in FIG. 18D, another nasal cannula 1900 includes two separate supply lines
1910A, 1910B, that are connected to individual nasal prongs 1940A, 1940B, respectively. The
individual nasal prongs 1940A, 1940B reduce rainout and/or sputtering as compared with
conventional nasal prongs that induce abrupt changes in the flow path, which may lead to inertial
impaction and rainout.
[1142]      The cannula assemblies described above were tested to determine the efficacy of each
embodiment in producing a substantially continuous flow with minimal rainout and/or sputter.
For example, a comparison of the performance of the aerosol delivery system 1000 (see FIGS. 6
                                               36

     WO 2013/163517                                                       PCT/US2013/038368
 8, 15 and 16) equipped a prior art cannula (see FIG. 18A) and with the nasal cannula assembly
 1700 was performed. In particular, as shown in FIG. 19, during an 8 hour run with a seven foot
 Salter HF1600 cannula (FIG. 18A) and the aerosol delivery system from FIGS. 6-8, a rainout of
  ~1.1 ml was observed, which caused a reduction in the aerosol output towards the later portion of
 8 hour run. During a similar 8 hour run with the nasal cannula 1700 (which also has a length of
 7 feet), a rainout of ~0.3 ml occurred, and there was substantially no decrease in the aerosol
 output towards the later portion of 8 hour run (FIG. 20). Table 2 below presents additional test
 data comparing the prior art cannula 1600 to the nasal cannula assemblies 1700 (FIG. 18B), 1800
 (FIG. 18C) and 1900 (FIG. 18D).

 [1143]      Although the entrainment chamber 1120 shown and described above defines a
 substantially linear pathway 1143 between the inlet port 1121 and the outlet port 1130, in
 other embodiments, an entrainment chamber can include any suitable geometry and/or can
 define any suitable flow path configuration to promote and/or enhance entrainment of the
 inlet aerosol into the entrainment fluid. For example, although shown as defining a sudden
 expansion, in some embodiments, an entrainment chamber need not define a sudden
 expansion. Moreover, although shown as defining a flow path that is substantially normal to
 an outlet axis of the aerosol generator, in other embodiments, an entrainment chamber can
 define one or more flow paths in relation to the aerosol generator having any suitable
 geometry or configuration.

[1144]      For example, FIG. 21A shows an entrainment chamber 220 having an aerosol
generator 222, an inlet 226 and an outlet 228 that are configured to provide an entrainment fluid
pathway 260.     As illustrated in FIG. 21A, the entrainment chamber 220 is configured as a
generally straight passageway for providing a fluid flow or fluid pathway 260. As illustrated in
FIG. 21B, an entrainment chamber 320 includes an aerosol generator 322, an inlet 326 and an
outlet 328 that provides an entrainment fluid pathway 360 and entrains the aerosol in an angle.
As shown in FIG. 21C, an entrainment chamber 420 includes an aerosol generator 422 and inlets
426 for providing a fluid flow entering in a downward direction from the sides of the chamber
420 to provide a downward fluid pathway 460 that exits at an outlet 428. As shown in FIG.
21D, an entrainment chamber 520 includes an aerosol generator 522 and inlets 526 for providing
a fluid flow entering in a upward direction from the sides of the chamber 520 to provide a
downward fluid pathway 560 that exits at an outlet 528. As shown in FIG. 21E, an entrainment
chamber 620 includes an aerosol generator 622 and inlets 626 for providing a fluid flow entering
at a generally perpendicular direction from the sides of the chamber 620 to provide a downward
fluid pathway 660 that exits at an outlet 628.
[1145]      As shown in FIGS. 21A-D, the entrainment fluid may be provided by one or more
inlets from the sides of the entrainment chamber adjacent the aerosol generator.         In some
embodiments as shown in FIG. 22A, an entrainment chamber 720 with an aerosol generator 722
may include an inlet 726 that provides a generally circular fluid flow 760 that then enters a
central region of the chamber 720 via channels 726A. The fluid flow 760 may then exit the
chamber 720 in a direction away from the aerosol generator 722, for example, as illustrated in
FIGS. 21A-D.       As shown in FIG. 22B, an entrainment chamber 820 includes an aerosol
generator 822 and a plurality of inlets 826 for providing a sideward fluid flow pathway 860 for
entraining the aerosol therein. The fluid flow 860 may then exit the chamber 820 in a direction
away from the aerosol generator 822, for example, as illustrated in FIGS. 21A-D.
[1146]      Referring to FIG. 2, although the particle selection chamber 1200 shown and
described above defines a substantially linear pathway 1243, and includes a single baffle 1246
upon which aerosol particles impinge, in other embodiments, a particle selection chamber can
include any suitable geometry and/or can define any suitable configuration to promote and/or
enhance selection and/or filtering of the entrained aerosol  AENT  to achieve the desired particle
size distribution.  For example, although shown as a single baffle, in some embodiments, a
particle selection chamber can include any number of baffles or flow-directing members (not
shown).    Moreover, although shown as defining a flow path that is substantially linear (with
exception of the curvature about the baffle 1246), in other embodiments, a particle chamber can
                                               38

   WO 2013/163517                                                           PCT/US2013/038368
define one or more flow paths that produce a cyclone and/or vortex within the flow to produce
the outlet aerosol having the desired particle size distribution.
[1147]      For example, as illustrated in FIG. 23A, a particle selection chamber 940 can include
a generally tubular member that has an inlet 928 and an outlet 940 and a curved portion 942.
Although the particle selection chamber 940 is illustrated with one curved portion 942, it should
be understood that multiple loops may be provided.           As illustrated in FIG. 23B, a particle
selection chamber 1040 can include an inlet 1028, an outlet 1044, and a plurality of baffles 1042
that provides a curvilinear fluid pathway 1060 by partially blocking a portion of the chamber
1040. Although the particle selection chamber 1040 is illustrated with three baffles 1042, it
should be understood that any suitable number of baffles may be used. As illustrated in FIG.
23C, a particle selection chamber 1640 can include an inlet 1628, an outlet 1644, and a particle
or mesh filter 1642 that that traps particles of a given size in an entrainment fluid pathway 1660.
The rain out or liquid aerosol particles from the filter 1642 then exit the chamber 1640 via a
drain 1650
[1148]      In some embodiments, non-linear fluid pathways may be provided by a particle
selection chamber that is configured to create a generally circular or "cyclone" fluid flow. For
example, as illustrated in Figures 17 and 18, a "cyclone" passive filtration system is illustrated
for removing larger aerosol droplets through centrifugal deposition. As illustrated in FIG. 24A, a
particle selection chamber 1740 can include an inlet 1728, an outlet 1744, a tapered body 1742
and a drain 1750. The curved body 1742 is configured to create the fluid pathway 1760, which
spirals in a downward direction from the inlet 1728 to the drain 1750 and then spirals in an
upward direction toward the outlet 1744. The radius of the downward direction of the pathway
1760 is generally greater than in the upward direction. As illustrated in FIG. 24B, a particle
selection chamber 1840 can include an inlet 1828 at one end and an outlet 1844 at the opposite
end. The chamber 1840 is configured to provide a spiral-shaped fluid pathway 1860 through the
cylindrical chamber 1840.
[1149]      In some embodiments, mechanical components may be used to provide a non-linear
flow pathway in the particle selection chamber. For example, as shown in FIG. 25, a cylindrical
particle selection chamber 1940 includes a spiral barrier 1942 that forms a spiral flow pathway
1960. As shown in FIG. 26, a particle selection chamber 2040 includes a plurality of nonlinear
passageways 2042 for bending the flow pathway 2060. In some embodiments as shown in FIG.
27, particle selection occurs in the elutriator 2100. The elutriator 2100 includes an intake 2102
and a vertical body 2104 and an output 2106.       The intake 2102 is connected to a nebulizer, and
                                                39

in the air elutriator body 2104, particles are ejected from a small fluidized bed into a flow of air
and carried upwards. The air velocity may determine the particle size selection such that as the
air velocity is increased, larger and larger particles are carried over.
[1150]      Although the aerosol preparation assembly 1100 is shown and described above as
including one entrainment chamber 1120 and one particle selection chamber 1200, in other
embodiments an aerosol preparation assembly can include any suitable number of entrainment
chambers and/or particle selection chambers.         In other embodiments, an aerosol preparation
assembly can include only one chamber that functions to produce an aerosol having the desired
characteristics, as discussed herein. For example, in some embodiments an aerosol preparation
assembly can be devoid of a distinct entrainment chamber, and can instead include one chamber
that performs the function of a particle selection chamber, as discussed herein.            In other
embodiments, an aerosol preparation assembly can include a single chamber that performs the
functions of the entrainment chamber and/or the particle selection chamber.
[1151]      In some embodiments, the aerosol preparation assembly 1100 can be movable
between a first (or opened) configuration and a second (or closed) configuration. When in the
first configuration, the entrainment volume 1142 and/or the particle selection volume 1242 can
be accessed for cleaning or the like. When in the second configuration, the entrainment volume
1142 and/or the particle selection volume 1242 can be closed for operation of the device. In
some embodiments, a portion of the aerosol preparation assembly 1100 can be hingedly coupled
together (e.g., in a clam shell configuration) to facilitate moving between the opened
configuration and the closed configuration.
[1152]      In some embodiments, the aerosol preparation assembly 3000, which is configured to
recycle and/or recirculation portions of the rained out aerosol, can include and electronic
controller (e.g., the electronic controller 600 described above with reference to FIG. 1) to
facilitate any such recycling.      A fluidics system may be controlled by electronic and/or
mechanical system(s) that collect the rained out liquid containing the active pharmaceutical
ingredient (API) collected between the vibrating mesh and the prongs of the nasal cannula. Such
a system then may mix additional water or other solvent into the rained out liquid to restore the
concentration of the API to the original concentration of the drug product before it was
concentrated by the nebulization and rainout cycle. The extent of the concentration of the API
within the rainout fluid in the course of extended aerosol infusions may either be determined by
measurements of parameters such as, but not limited to, osmolarity, conductivity, UV/VIS
spectra or other key parameter of the drug product solution allowing for determination of the

concentration. Alternatively, a predetermined and preprogramed algorithm based on historically
measured values contained within the control circuitry could be used to add a dilution medium
such as sterile water into a predetermined amount of rained out fluid.            Such recycled fluid
restored to its original concentration would be sterile filtered by a passage through a 0.22 um
filter before re-nebulization, by exposure to UV light, and/or the like.         Such fluidics system
additionally may allow for dose metering by controlling the rate of the fluid injection into the
aerosol generator. Such a system may be also built into the drug canister, which could contain
the water or other fluid for concentration adjustment in addition to the fill dose of the drug
product. Alternatively, the aerosol generator output may be modified and tuned down as the
concentration of the API increases due to drug recycling. The concentration of the API may be
measured within the aerosol preparation assembly or pre-determined so that the aerosol generator
output is tuned down gradually. In this manner, the rate of API emission from the prongs of the
nasal cannula assembly can remain essentially constant over the course of the aerosol infusion,
lasting from 30 min to 24 hours/day
[1153]       In some embodiments, a gravity-fed drug canister, such as that generally disclosed in
FIGS. 3 and 17A-17B, or other drug canister can be configured to limit the liquid column height
(which exerts pressure on the vibrating mesh membrane of a nebulizer, when the aerosol
generator is a nebulizer), to 50 mm for the Aerogen Aeroneb Lab and Pro vibrating mesh
membranes.       For certain aerosol generators, liquid columns higher than 50 mm may lead to
decrease in the output of the membrane due to the hydrostatic pressure.
[1154]       In some embodiments, a drug canister/cartridge can include a filter (e.g. a 0.22 pim
filter)   at   the   exit   port  thereof.     In   such     embodiments,     the   contained   liquid
formulation/medicament of the drug product is dispensed from the exit port to be fed towards the
aerosol generator, which can prevent contamination due to blowback and potential pathogen
replication in the course of prolonged aerosol infusion lasting from 0.5 to 24 hours per day.
[1155]       In some embodiments, the drug canister containing an electronic monitoring system
for keeping track of the time of use, and for disabling the ability to use the drug container after a
certain time of use, or after expiration of the shelf life of such container may be provided, and/or
the like. Such a system increases patient safety by reducing and/or preventing refills formulated
by unqualified personnel.
[1156]       In some embodiments, the drug canister can contain a unique interface with the
device allowing secure locking/docking of the drug canister into the device. A secure and sterile
connection can be made for the passage of the medicament into the aerosol generator, and for
                                                41

one-way or two-way electronic communication between the aerosol generator and the drug
canister.
[1157]      For APIs without extended stability, the drug canister can contain dry powder
capsules of the API with the excipients that would be reconstituted prior to nebulization either
within the drug canister and/or within the aerosol generator. The drug canister or the base station
may contain sterile distilled water cartridges for reconstitution of the dry powder into the liquid
formulation of the drug product.
[1158]      Although shown and described above as including a compliance chamber and/or
being operable with a substantially steady-state flow of inlet gas, in other embodiments, it may
be desirable to use a pulsed air flow. In other words, in some embodiments, the gas entraining
the aerosol can be characterized by a pulsatile flow profile (i.e., a flow having periodic variations
or that is characterized as being substantially transient). This arrangement may produce lower
particle size selections and/or more efficient particle selection compared to non-pulsative
entrainment fluids of the same average flowrate (with all other factors, such as nozzle diameter
and baffle size and shape being equal). The source of such pulsatile flow may be, but is not
limited to, a diaphragm pump, a peristaltic pump, a rotary vane pump or compressed gas with an
actuated valve producing the oscillatory pattern connected in series and upstream of the
entrainment chamber.
[1159]      Although the methods and sytems are shown and described herein as producing a
substantially continuous flow of aerosolized medicament over an extended time period (e.g., 8
hours), in other embodiments, a method can include periodic delivery of the aerosolized
medicament over an extended period of time. In particular, because of the unexpectedly high
deposition efficiency achieved the the systems shown herein, in certain situations, a desired
dosing level (for example, 300 mg of NaCl) can be completed in less than a desired time period.
Accordingly, in some embodiments, a method includes cycling the airflow and/or the aerosol
generator to produce periods of delivery and non-delivery during the treatment regimen. For
example, in some embodiments, a method includes delivering a dosage of hypertonic saline for a
first time period (the "on" period, e.g., 15 minutes) and then reducing and/or stopping the
delivery for a second time period (the "off' period, e.g., 5 minutes), and then repeating this cycle
for the treatment duration (e.g., 8 hours). In some embodiments, the first time period can be
different from the second time period.        In some embodiments, the "on period" can vary
throughout the treatment regimen. This allows, for example, an initial or "priming" amount of
the dosage to be delivered at the beginning of the treatment regimen.

[1160]      To assess flow pulsatility of a peristaltic pump used in testing of the devices in FIGS.
5-8, the analogue output of the flow meter TSI 4000 was wired to an Agilent Technologies
mixed signal oscilloscope (E1457) and the data was logged to usb. Raw voltage was recorded
and the flow rate post-processed (calibrated using the fact that the voltage output range 0-10 V
represents a flow rate range from 0 - 200 L/min) at two frequencies (to investigate both small
and large scale variations). A compliance chamber with a volume of 2L was connected in line to
the output of the pump and its impact was explored. FIGS. 28 and 29 displays the oscillatory
nature of the pump output (the solid line, identified as trace 2802 in FIG. 28 and trace 2902 in
FIG. 29) and the impact of 2L compliance chamber on the amplitude of airflow (the dotted line,
identified as trace 2808 in FIG. 28 and trace 2908 in FIG. 29).        Compressed air was used to
provide a steady airflow for comparison (the dashed line, identified as trace 2806 in FIG. 28 and
trace 2906 in FIG. 29). The use of 2L compliance chamber reduced or eliminated the oscillatory
nature of the output from Pump A.
[1161]      The ability of the aerosol preparation assembly 1100 (e.g., as shown in FIGS. 6-8) to
remove large particles was explored with and without a compliance chamber and Pump A.
Under identical operating conditions with 3.5 mm nozzle and 2L/min average airflow, the
oscillatory airflow produced by Pump A without a compliance chamber led to more effective
removal of large particles compared to steady airflow from Pump A with a compliance chamber.
As shown in FIG. 30, the VMD was 1.9 gm for the aerosol preparation assembly used without a
compliance chamber (see trace 3004), and was 3.1 gm for the aerosol preparation assembly used
with a compliance chamber (see trace 3002). The decreased VMD is accompanied by decreased
rate of aerosol volume emission since large amount of aerosol volume is contained within the
large aerosol particle. Given these outcomes, the aerosol preparation assembly 1100, and any
other systems shown herein, are able to produce aerosols from port 1230 with (1) small
percentage of particles above 3-4 gm and (2) sufficient rate of aerosol emission by either using a
non-pulsatile airflow and a slightly smaller nozzle 28B diameter or by using a pulsatile airflow
and slightly larger nozzle 28B diameter, all other factors and operating conditions being equal.
[1162]      Although the nasal cannula assemblies 1700, 1800 and 1900 shown and described
above as being devoid of a bifurcation, in some embodiments a nasal cannula can include a
bifurcation and/or a flow member configured to split and/or separate the flow therethrough.
Such embodiments can include features and/or define flow paths in contact with the flow
member to minimize and/or reduce rainout due to impaction. For example, as illustrated in FIG.
31, a cannula bifurcation junction 2200 includes a separation partition 2210 that is introduced
into the single supply line. The partition 2210 then separates into two bifurcated lines 2220 such

that an impaction surface may be reduced. In some embodiments, the initial cross-sectional area
following the bifurcation junction may be constant until a circular cross-section is attained, and
then the cross-sectional area may be gradually decreased to gradually accelerate the speed of
aerosol in the lower diameter tubing section heading to the nasal prong(s). Additional shapes of
bifurcated cannula assemblies are disclosed in FIG. 32 wherein the shape of the cross-section
following the bifurcation gradually changes shape to circular cross-section while keeping the
area of the cross section, as well as the airflow, constant until circular cross-section is reached.
[1163]      In some embodiment, a nasal cannula assembly can include an "active" rain-out
management system, such as, for example, liquid rainout traps or absorbent materials
placed/constructed within the nasal cannula tubing. In some embodiments, such active rainout
management systems can retain and/or have a capacity of 0.5 to 2 ml, or 5 ml, or more, per about
8 hours of operation for systems such as those disclosed herein.
[1164]      In some embodiments, a nasal cannula can include an adsorbent material coated along
the length of the nasal cannula. Such adsorbent coating can be engineered to have the capacity to
absorb 0.05 ml to 5, or 10 ml, of "rain-out" liquid. In some embodiments, the inner surface or a
portion of any other surface of the cannula assembly may be manufactured from a liquid
absorbent polymer or other liquid absorbent materials. The bifurcation junction may also be
manufactured from a liquid absorbent polymer. The nose piece and/or the prongs may be
manufactured from liquid absorbent polymer or other liquid absorbent materials.
[1165]      In some embodiments, the internal surface of any of the nasal cannula assembly
described herein can include and/or define cavities (ridges, bubbles etc.) designed to retain any
rained out fluid.
[1166]      As discussed above, the removal of a portion of the inlet aerosol via the aerosol
preparation assembly 1100, as described above, also necessarily results in a decrease in the rate
of delivery of the therapeutic agent. Accordingly, the rate of deposition (e.g., the total mass
deposited per unit time) of a therapeutic compound using the systems (e.g., the aerosol delivery
system 1000) and methods described herein will likely be lower than the rate of deposition of the
same compound using known systems and methods. In particular, it has been demonstrated that
approximately 110 mg to 250 mg of NaCl deposited (via oral delivery) in the lung of CF patients
led to significant improvements in lung function when administered as a bolus aerosol dose for
approximately 18 minutes (Elkins et al., A controlled trial of long-term inhaled hypertonic saline
in patients with cystic fibrosis, N Engl J Med 354(3):229-240; Donaldson et al., Mucus clearance
and lung function in cystic fibrosis with hypertonic saline, N Engl J Med 354(3):241-250). In

some embodiments, a method includes delivering transnasally approximately the same mass of
deposited NaCl (e.g., between approximately 110 mg and 250 mg, or higher) over extended
times of six to eight hours (and up to twenty four hours per day). In particular, to deposit 110 mg
of NaCl in the lung over an 8 hour extended aerosol infusion according to the methods described
herein, the rate of NaCl mass deposition on the surface of the lung may be about 0.23 mg/min.
For 250 mg NaCl dose deposited in the lung according to the methods described herein, the rate
of NaCl mass deposition on the surface of the lung may be about 0.52 mg/min. These rates of
NaCl mass deposition can be produced by a particular predetermined rate of aerosol volume
deposition on the surface of the airway, the aerosol including a predeteremined concentration of
active pharmaceutical ingredient in the drug product.
[1167]      For example, Table 3 provides such rates for the aerosol volume deposition on the
surface of the airways as a function of concentration of HS in an aerosolized solution to provide
the desired NaCl (mg) deposition rates.

[1168]      The rate of NaCl mass and aerosolized NaCl solution volume deposited on the
surface of the airways is a function of the deposition efficiency of the therapeutic composition
and delivery system. Similarly stated, the rate of aerosol emission from the nasal cannula of the
embodiments described herein to result in the pulmonary deposition of the targeted 250 mg of
NaCl achieved over eight hour extended aerosol administration are dependent on the
concentration of aerosolized NaCl solution and the deposition efficiency.

[1169]      The systems and methods described herein include transnasal delivery of therapeutic
compounds into the lower airways. As shown in FIG. 33, the systems described herein can
include a nasal cannula assembly 3310 that conveys an aerosol       (ADEL) into the nares of a patient
P. The delivered aerosol   ADEL   (i.e., out of the nasal cannula) can be characterized by a particle
size (e.g., VMD), a flow rate and a concentration of the therapeutic compound. For example, in
some embodiments, the particle size (VMD) can be about 0.5 microns, can be about 1 micron,
can be about 1.1 microns, can be about 1.2 microns, can be about 1.3 microns, can be about 1.4
microns, can be about 1.5 microns, can be about 1.6 microns, can be about 1.7 microns, can be
about 1.8 microns, can be about 1.9 microns, can be about 2 microns, can be about 2.5 microns,
and all values in between. In some embodiments, the flow rate can be about 0.1 gl/min, about
0.2 gl/min, about 0.5 gl/min, about 1 gl/min, about 1.5 gl/min, about 2 gl/min, about 2.5 gl/min,
about 3 gl/min, about 4 gl/min, about 5 gl/min, about 6 gl/min, about 7 gl/min, about 8 gl/min,
about 9 gl/min, about 10 gl/min, and all values in between.
[1170]      As shown in FIG. 33, as the aerosol particles according to some embodiments are
conveyed through the nasal cannula of the patient P for trans-nasal delivery, the natural humidity
in the airways (e.g. the airways 3340A-3340D) lungs causes the particles to accumulate water.
Water accumulation increases the size and weight of the particles (e.g. see particle 3360A vs.
particle 3360B), and can result in efficient penetration of the particle into desired locations
within the respiratory tract, enhanced lung deposition, and enhanced absorption. Exhalation of
the aerosolized drug is thus avoided and consistent doses of high concentrations of inhaled drugs
can be delivered to the patient P. The use of different entrainment gases, the initial mass loading
of the drug aerosolized, as well as the nature of the drug itself (e.g. hygroscopic nature) can be
balanced to achieve predetermined growth and/or target deposition to specific regions of the
respiratory tract.
[1171]      EXAMPLES
[1172]      Performance characteristics of aerosol delivery systems described herein are
shown in FIGS. 34A-34B. In FIG. 34A, the particle size of an output of an aerosol delivery
system according to embodiments described herein is shown to be generally uniform
regardless of the input particle size distribution (Aeroneb T M Pro Nebulizer VMD (gm)). FIG.
34B illustrates the consistency of the aerosol output achieved with five different aerosol
source nebulizers.     Regardless of the aerosol particle size distribution produced by
Aeroneb TM Pro nebulizers currently used, aerosol delivery systems according to some
embodiments described herein produce an aerosol emitted from the prongs of the nasal

cannula with uniform particle size of the desired range (1.3 to 1.4 gm VMD, FIG. 34A). In
terms of aerosol volume emitted from the system (gl/min or gg/min of NaCl with 7% carb
HS), sufficiently uniform output can be achieved via nebulizer screening to support 80% to
120% dose uniformity, as required by the regulators for commercial products (FIG. 34B).
FIG. 37 illustrates the efficiency of pulmonary deposition for aerosol delivery systems
according to some embodiments (labeled "Parion tPAD-1TM) compared to a conventional
Pari LC StarM nebulizer. Embodiments achieved a mean pulmonary deposition fraction (38
+/- 9%) (% of dose emitted from the nebulizer) that was not different than that of a standard
nebulizer (38 +/- 9%). Head/nasal deposition was only slightly increased with an aerosol
delivery system according to embodiments (7 +/- 7% as compared with 2 +/ 3%) and the
stomach/esophageal activity was not different (5 +/- 7% as compared with 5 +/ 3%).
[1173]      Characterization of the aerosol from a tPAD-1 device used in the Phase 1
safety, tolerability and deposition efficiency study: An aerosol preparation assembly
according to an embodiment (also referred to herein as a "tPAD device") was produced to
support a deposition study in healthy human subjects. This device was extensively tested
before and after dosing of each subject to verify its performance. No problems were
identified with the design or the performance of the device during the Phase 1 study with
numerous Aerogen Aeroneb Pro nebulizers and tPAD cannulas used.
[1174]      Due to the variability in nebulizer output for Aeroneb Pro nebs, the commercially
distributed nebulizers were screened for output and particles size to achieve 1) similar rates of
aerosolization of 7% HS from the tPAD drug reservoir and 2) similar emitted dose from the
tPAD device. Regardless of the aerosol particle size distribution produced by Aeroneb Pro
nebulizers currently used in the tPAD device, tPAD device produces an aerosol emitted from
the prongs of the tPAD nasal cannula with uniform particle size (1.3 to 1.4 gm VMD, FIG.
34A). In terms of aerosol volume emitted from the tPAD device (gl/min or gg/min of NaCl
with 7% carb-HS), sufficiently uniform output can be achieved via nebulizer screening to
support 80% to 120% dose uniformity (FIG. 34B). The average dose emitted from the prongs
of tPAD-1 nasal cannula was 2.2 mg/min of NaCl (or 32 gl/min) with 7% HS (FIG. 34B).
[1175]      Methodology:    The particle size distribution from the 510K approved and
commercially distributed Aerogen Aeroneb Pro nebulizers and from the fully assembled
tPAD device was tested via laser diffraction on Sympatec or Spraytec instruments. The
aerosol outputs from Aerogen Aeroneb Pro nebulizers were tested gravimetrically. The
aerosol output from the fully assembled tPAD device was measured at the prongs of the nasal

was measured via HPLC on an ion exchange column for the samples eluted from the filters.
Safety, tolerability and deposition efficiency of 7% HS delivered by the tPAD device to
healthy human subjects:
[1176]      Background: Based on the literature describing pulmonary deposition and
theoretical modeling describing pulmonary deposition of trans-nasally delivered aerosols, a
goal to achieve 5% pulmonary deposition efficiency was set, as a threshold to advancing the
development of the tPAD device in combination with select therapeutic agents. It was
reasoned that the tPAD device must be able to achieve a minimum lung dose to show a
clinical benefit. For example, for hypertonic saline use in cystic fibrosis, a NaCl dose
previously shown to have clinical benefit is ~1 10 mg of NaCl, deposited in the lungs per oral
aerosol administration per subject per day, achieved by Elkins et al. via BID dosing of 7% HS
with a Pari LC Plus nebulizer. Larger benefits in FEV 1 were achieved with 250 mg of NaCl,
deposited in the lungs per subject per day, as achieved by Donaldson et al. via QID dosing of
7% HS with a Pari LC Plus nebulizer trans-orally. The previously published work on trans
nasally delivery aerosols reported ~1.5% pulmonary deposition efficiency. Thus, the targeted
5% deposition efficiency was a challenging goal. Once the design of the tPAD device was
optimized, the pulmonary deposition of HS administered via the tPAD device in healthy
human subjects was evaluated.
[1177]      Methods and Primary Objective: Six healthy human subjects (three males and
three females) were administered radiolabeled 7% HS (99mTc-DTPA) for a period of 15 min
via the tPAD device vs. via the Pari LC Star in an open-label crossover study (FIG. 35). The
primary objective of the study was to quantitatively evaluate the efficiency of pulmonary
deposition of 7% HS labeled with 99mTc-DTPA, based on the aerosol emitted from the prongs
of the nasal cannula for the tPAD device vs. from the oral mouthpiece of the LC Star.
[1178]      The study was conducted under an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) and
the protocol was approved by the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill IRB. Written
informed consent was obtained from all participants in the study. All subjects were > 18 years
of age, received a medical exam prior to beginning the study, had normal FEV 1 values (>
90% of predicted values), and were free of respiratory tract infection for 4 weeks prior to the
study enrollment and without evidence of active rhinosinusoidal disease.
[1179]      The tPAD device, with a set of Aeroneb Pro nebulizers representative of average
output and particle size for these commercial nebulizers produced an average output from the

prongs of the cannula of 32 gl/min of aerosol or ~0.47 ml in 15 min. Prior to the first
deposition study, spirometry testing was performed and a transmission scan, using a planar
57Co   source, was used to outline lung boundaries and define central/peripheral pulmonary
regions of interest. We delivered to each subject 7% HS containing 99mTc-DTPA, as a
radiotracer to quantitate via external radiation counting of deposited aerosol, for 15 minutes
with each delivery device during separate study visits according to established methods. The
specific activity of the isotope used was adjusted to achieve a similar deposited lung activity
after 15 min of nebulization, given the predicted differences in device output (~O.1 mCi/ml
for Pari LC Star and 0.4 mCi/ml for tPAD device). Exhaled aerosols were captured by filter
systems uniquely designed for both nebulizer systems to minimize exposure to the volunteers
and prevent re-inhalation of aerosols that could confound the interpretation of the data. To
acclimatize the subject to the exhalation filter system prior to dosing the radiotracer,
unlabeled 7% HS was administered by the tPAD device for 15 minutes. For both devices,
subjects were instructed to use their spontaneous breathing patterns. Before the start of
nebulization, tPAD and LC Star devices with fill dose of 7% HS (containing       9 9mTc-DTPA)
were imaged via a gamma (radiation counting) camera to allow mass balance calculation.
Immediately after 15 minutes of 7% HS (99mTc-DTPA) inhalation, an initial radio-aerosol
deposition scan was acquired and continuous 1 minute images were recorded for the next 30
minutes. Post-dose spirometry testing was performed after radio-aerosol deposition scans
were completed. At the end of the study, the device with residual dose, and the exhalation
filter system used with the tPAD device were imaged to allow emitted dose and mass balance
calculation.
[1180]      Analyses: Lung deposition efficiency (%) was calculated by measuring the
radioactivity deposited in the lung and based on the emitted dose. Correction factors were
applied to account for signal attenuation differences between the nose and lungs, and
lung/nasal clearance. The emitted dose was based on the mass balance of radiolabel deposited
1) within the subject, 2) in the mask or 3) in the exhalation filter. Pulmonary deposition
efficiency was then calculated as: deposited dose/emitted volume x 100%. Extrathoracic
deposition (head region, stomach) was assessed similarly. Aerosol distribution between the
central and peripheral airways in the lung was assessed by calculating the central:peripheral

[1182]      No adverse events were reported during the study in the six subjects. The HS
administration by the tPAD device was well tolerated during the 30 minutes dosing with 7%
HS (15 minute for each unlabeled and radio-labeled HS). No differences in FEV1 were
observed between pre-dose and post-dose spirometry measurements for either device with
105.8% and 106% predicted FEV 1 baseline values and -0.8% and 1.3% change post-dose for
the tPAD and LC Star devices, respectively.
[1183]      Results (Deposition): In a marked contrast to previously described                1.5%
pulmonary deposition efficiency for trans-nasal aerosols, a high fraction of the dose emitted
from the tPAD device was deposited in the lung (38±9%, n=6). The deposition in nasal
passages was relatively low and accounted for 7+7% (n=6) of the emitted dose, plus an
additional 5±3% (n=6) likely associated with nasal deposition, that was cleared and
swallowed prior to initial deposition scan. The tPAD aerosol deposited in a uniform,
peripheral airway pattern (FIG. 36), with C/P ratio of 1.06+0.07 (n=6),consistent with the
optimal dosing for many lung diseases.
[1184]      For the Pari LC Star, depositions of 38±9%, 2±3%, 5±3%              (n=6), in the lung,
oropharynx and esophagus/GI, respectively, based on the emitted dose were observed.
Accounting for residual volume left in the LC Star following the completion of 15 minute
inhalation, the deposition efficiency based on fill dose was ~ 18% which is consistent with
previously published values. Based on the C/P analysis (C/P ratio of 1.31+0.21 for Pari LC
Star, n=6), the Pari LC Star generated more centrally deposited aerosol, which is consistent
with the larger aerosol particles produced by the LC Star (3.6 gm VMD).

[11851      Surprisingly, the tPAD trans-nasal delivery performed as well as the most refined
of oral jet nebulizers i.e. the LC Star.      The tPAD device produces almost an order of
magnitude more efficient pulmonary deposition than any other known system to administer
aerosols trans-nasally.    Based on the 38% deposition efficiency, the tPAD device can
administer NaCl doses exceeding the designated 250 mg of NaCl that showed clinical benefit
in CF per Donaldson et al. For example, the output of 32 gl/min (or 2.2 mg/min with 7%
HS), with an "average" Aeroneb Pro nebulizer, would result in a deposited dose of 401 mg
of NaCl over 8 hours (2.2 mg/min x 0.38 efficiency x 480 min). With "higher-performing"
Aeroneb Pro nebulizers, an output of 50 gl/min (or 3.5 mg/min with 7% HS) has been
achieved, which would result in a deposited dose of 638 mg. Validated methods to "detune"
the performance of the tPAD device to achieve the designated 250 mg dose are readily
available (e.g. duty cycle modification for a vibrating mesh nebulizer). Lastly, the observed
low nasal deposition was well tolerated in the present study and should be compatible with
long term safety and with sleep. In summary, with 30-50 gl/min nasal prong output, 38%
deposition efficiency, a desirable peripheral airways deposition pattern in the lung, and
favorable safety and tolerability profiles, the tPAD device is able to support trans-nasal
administration of therapeutically effective doses of aerosolized therapeutic agents, including
overnight HS dosing in CF patients with delivery of therapeutically effective NaCl doses.
[1186]      As described herein, in some embodiments, a system and/or method of transnasal
delivery can produce a deposition efficiency of greater than 3%, greater than 5%, greater than
10%, greater than 15%, greater than 20%, greater than 25%, greater than 30 %, greater than
35% and as much as approximately 40%. In some embodiments, a system and/or method of
transnasal delivery can produce a deposition efficiency of greater than 40%, greater than
45%, greater than 50%, greater than 55%, greater than 60%, greater than 65%, greater than
70 %, greater than 75% and as much as approximately 80%. For example, when a system is
run only during the inhalation cycle, a deposition greater than 40% and/or up to about 80%
deposition efficiency can be achieved.         In another example, when a system is run
continuously, a deposition efficiency of up to about 40% can be achieved.              In some
embodiments, for example, a method can include producing an aerosol of HS having a
concentration of 7% and a VMD of approximately 1.4 gin. The method includes delivering,
transnasally, the aerosol into the lungs such that a deposition efficiency of approximately
40% is achieved.

the prongs of nasal cannula (gl/min) for 7% to 21% hypertonic saline to deposit 250 mg of

NaCl into the lung of CF patients over 8 hours for deposition efficiencies ranging from 15%
to 40% of the emitted dose. As shown in Table 3, at least 19gl/min of aerosolized 7% HS
emitted from the prongs of nasal cannula is delivered assuming very high 40% depositing of
such intranasal aerosol in the lung. Additionally, the method and systems described herein
include producing such output consistently and substantially continuously over 8 hours
without excessive rainout to deliver the desirable therapeutic dose and be well-tolerated by
the patients.  By delivering the therapeutic compound at a low rate of deposition over a
longer period of time, increased saline concentration can be employed. For example, in some
embodiments, a method includes delivering 21% hypertonic saline at a deposition efficiency
of 40%, and at an output of 6 gl/min to produce delivery of 250 mg of NaCl into the deep
lung of CF patients. If only 50 mg dose of NaCl mass deposited in the lung of patients during
eight hour extended aerosol administration would be therapeutically sufficient, with aerosol
deposition efficiency of 25% an output of only 2 gl/min of 21% HS aerosol emitted from the
prongs of nasal cannula would be needed. For other more potent therapeutic agents, an output
of 10-fold or 100-fold lower magnitude (0.2 and 0.02 gl/min respectively) could be
sufficient.

deposited on the surface of the airways, are displayed in Table 6 as a function of deposition

[1189]      The embodiments disclosed herein also relate to compositions comprising
hypertonic saline and/or a pharmaceutically acceptable osmolyte suitable for use in the
medicament delivery devices, and in accordance with the methods disclosed herein.
Accordingly, the present compositions may be adapted for various administration routes and
methods in which such composition(s) are to be employed.                For example, in some
embodiments, the present compositions may be adapted for transnasal delivery via an aerosol
having a particle size distribution as described herein.
[1190]      Disclosed embodiments unexpectedly addressed previous shortcomings of very low
trans-nasal pulmonary deposition efficiency by providing methods, compositions and an
apparatus for administering active agents to the lungs of a subject trans-nasally with high
pulmonary deposition efficiencies. One embodiment is a method of treating at least one lung/the
lungs of a subject in need thereof, comprising: administering an active agent to at least one
lung/the lungs of a subject.
[1191]      In some embodiments, the administering is carried out by aerosol administration. In
some embodiments, the administering is carried out by inhalation administration.          In some
embodiments,     the administering     is carried out overnight.     In some embodiments, the
administering is carried out while the subject is sleeping.           In some embodiments, the

administering is carried out during the day. In some embodiments, the administering is carried
out while the subject is awake. In some embodiments, the administering is carried out to a
human subject. In some embodiments, the administering is carried out to an animal subject. In
some embodiments, the aerosol particle size emitted from the device has 0.5 to 2.5 gm VMD
(volume median diameter), with more preferred 1 to 2 gm VMD and most preferred 1.2 to 1.6
gm VMD. In some embodiments, the aerosol particle size distribution is such that there are not
more than 10%, 5%, 2.5% and in the most preferred embodiment not more than 1% particles
larger than 4 gm based on volume normalized amounts. In some embodiments, the solution can
by hypotonic, isotonic or hypertonic. In more preferred embodiments, the solution is hypertonic.
In some embodiments, NaCl is used to modulate the tonicity of the solution, so that the overall
rate of NaCl deposition is likely below 3 mg/min, 2 mg/min or 1 mg/min of NaCl deposited on
the surface of the airway epithelium. In some embodiments, NaCl is used to modulate the
tonicity of the solution either alone or with combination(s) with other therapeutic agent(s). In
some embodiments, other osmolyte agents such as sodium bicarbonate, mannitol, glucose and
others are used to modulate the tonicity of the aerosol solution, either alone or in combination
with other therapeutic agent(s). In some embodiments, the osmolyte agent concentration is used
to modulate deposition fraction of the aerosol in individual portions of the airways (e.g. large
airways vs. small airways vs. alveolar regions). In some embodiments, the higher osmolyte
concentration is used to increase central deposition of the aerosol, compared to lower osmolyte
concentration leading to more peripheral deposition.          In some embodiments, the aerosol
administration is conducted for extended periods of time, i.e. 60 min to 8 hours and longer, e.g.,
about 8 to about 24 hours (by sustained administering, infusion administering, or cyclical
administering).   In some embodiments, the aerosol administration is conducted for shorter
periods of time, i.e. 60 min or shorter as a replacement for aerosol administration via 1) jet,
vibrating mesh, vibrating horn and ultrasonic nebulizers; 2) MDIs; and 3) DPIs.            In some
embodiments, the administration is carried out by trans-nasal administration of the aerosol. For
example, the aerosol administration can be carried out over a period of more than about 1 hour,
or up to about 4 hours, or up to about 6 hours, or up to about 8 hours, or up to about 10 hours, or
up to 12 hours, or up to 14 hours, or up to 16 hours, or up to 18 hours, or up to 20 hours, or up to
22 hours, or up to 24 hours, and the aerosol may be administered once each day or multiple times
each day if possible. In some embodiments, a first dose can be a priming dose that delivers a
higher dosage, while subsequent doses deliver lower dosages of the osmolyte agent.
[1192]      In some embodiments, the composition can include both an osmoyte (saline) and
another active ingredient (e.g., albuterol).     In accordance with the systems and methods

described herein, the composition can be formulated and the system can be configured to
produce a desired aerosol particle size such that the active ingredient is delivered to a specific
portion of the airway. For example, in some embodiments, the osmolyte can be selected having
a desired tonnicity and the aerosol delivery system can be selected to produce a particle size to
cooperatively deliver the active ingredient into a portion of the airway of interest (e.g., the lower
airway, the upper airway or the like).

[1197]      These agents include but are not limited to agents that (i) enhance or facilitate mucus
clearance; (ii) have antimicrobial activity; (iii) have anti-inflammatory activity; (iv) or have
bronchodilator activity; and (v) all other agents currently administered by inhalation via
nebulizers, MDIs and DPIs. For agents with undesirable safety or tolerability properties due to
high local or systemic concentration following bolus administration via nebulizer, administration
by inhalation over the course of 8 to 24 hours or overnight to a patient via nasal cannula may
improve the therapeutic index for such agents.
[1198]      Exemplary Agents that Facilitate Mucus Clearance
[1199]      Adequate mucus clearance (MC) is a crucial factor in the maintenance of normal
airway health, is dependent on mucus rheology, airway hydration, and ciliary beat frequency
(CBF). Abnormal mucus clearance is an important contributor to the phenotype of patients with
chronic bronchitis due to environmental or genetic causes. Normal mucus clearance requires 1)
adequate hydration of the airway surface and 2) an absence of strong adhesive interaction
between the mucus and cell surface. Hydration is formally defined by the concentrations of
mucins in the periciliary and mucus layers. Ion transport properties regulate the amount of salt
and water (i.e. the solvent) and goblet cells and glands control the concentration of mucins on the
airway surface. Both cystic fibrosis (CF) patients and subjects with chronic bronchitis associated
with cigarette smoke exposure, i.e., COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease), exhibit
increases in mucus concentration as quantified by % solids, as a result of reduced airway
hydration and mucin hypersecretion, consequent to goblet cell and glandular hyperplasia. Both
as a function of disease severity, and in acute exacerbations, raised mucin/mucus concentrations

osmolytes such as sugars, sugar-alcohols, and organic osmolytes. Sugars and sugar-alcohols
useful in the practice of the disclosed embodiments include but are not limited to 3-carbon sugars
(e.g., glycerol, dihydroxyacetone); 4-carbon sugars (e.g., both the D and L forms of erythrose,
threose, and erythrulose); 5-carbon sugars (e.g., both the D and L forms of ribose, arabinose,
xylose, lyxose, psicose, fructose, sorbose, and tagatose); 6-carbon sugars (e.g., both the D and L

sugar/sugar alcohol useful in the disclosed embodiments are also suitable active compounds. For
example, glucose, when reduced, becomes sorbitol; within the scope of the invention, sorbitol
and other reduced forms of sugar/sugar alcohols (e.g., mannitol, dulcitol, arabitol) are
accordingly suitable active compounds.

    WO 2013/163517                                                        PCT/US2013/038368
[1207]      Suitable osmotically active compounds additionally include the family of non-ionic
osmolytes termed "organic osmolytes. " The term "organic osmolytes" is generally used to refer
to molecules used to control intracellular osmolality in the kidney. See e.g., J. S. Handler et al.,
Comp. Biochem. Physiol., 117:301-306 (1997); M. Burg, Am. J. Physiol. 268: F983-F996
(1995), each incorporated herein by reference. Although the inventor does not wish to be bound
to any particular theory, it appears that these organic osmolytes are useful in controlling
extracellular volume on the airway/pulmonary surface.         Organic osmolytes useful as active
compounds for the disclosed embodiments include but are not limited to three major classes of
compounds: polyols (polyhydric alcohols), methylamines, and amino acids. The polyol organic
osmolytes considered useful in the practice of the disclosed embodiments include, but are not
limited to, inositol, myo-inositol, and sorbitol. The methylamine organic osmolytes useful in the
practice of disclosed embodiments include, but are not limited to, choline, betaine, carnitine (L-,
D-   and DL forms), phosphorylcholine,         lyso-phosphorylcholine, glycerophosphorylcholine,
creatine, and creatine phosphate. Suitable amino acid organic osmolytes include, but are not
limited to, the D- and L-forms of glycine, alanine, glutamine, glutamate, aspartate, proline and
taurine. Additional osmolytes useful in the practice of disclosed embodiments include tihulose
and sarcosine. Mammalian organic osmolytes are preferred, with human organic osmolytes being
most preferred. However, certain organic osmolytes are of bacterial, yeast, and marine animal
origin, and these compounds are also useful active compounds for the practice of disclosed
embodiments.
[1208]      Under certain circumstances, an osmolyte precursor may be administered to the
subject; accordingly, these compounds are also useful in the practice of the disclosed
embodiments. The term "osmolyte precursor" as used herein refers to a compound which is
converted into an osmolyte by a metabolic step, either catabolic or anabolic. Suitable osmolyte
precursors of this invention include, but are not limited to, glucose, glucose polymers, glycerol,
choline, phosphatidylcholine, lyso-phosphatidylcholine and inorganic phosphates, which are
precursors of polyols and methylamines. Suitable precursors of amino acid osmolytes include
proteins, peptides, and polyamino acids, which are hydrolyzed to yield osmolyte amino acids,
and metabolic precursors which can be converted into osmolyte amino acids by a metabolic step
such as transamination. For example, a precursor of the amino acid glutamine is poly-L
glutamine, and a precursor of glutamate is poly-L-glutamic acid.
[1209]      In one embodiment, the osmolyte is hypotonic saline, isotonic saline, or hypertonic
saline used as the active agent.
[1210]      The Importance of Buffering Systems for Aerosolized Therapies
                                                59

    WO 2013/163517                                                          PCT/US2013/038368
[1211]      Buffering agents contained in pharmaceutical formulations are typically added to
maintain the     activity or stability of the pharmaceutical         product.    Furthermore, upon
aerosolization and delivery of the aerosol to lung airway surfaces, the buffering agents can
maintain the physiological pH of lung airway surfaces.          For example, the pH of the airway
surface liquid is regulated to values of ~ pH 7 to 7.4, and airways host defense in part depends on
maintenance of the pH. Buffering agents used in formulations of aerosolized therapies, therefore,
may be are useful for 1) preventing acidification of the airway surface occurring with
hyperosmolar therapies; 2) normalization of the pH of the airway surface for diseases
accompanied or associated or caused by lower than normal airway surface pH; and 3) to prevent
or attenuate the drop in the airway surface following administration of aerosols that would
otherwise be formulated at pH lower than the airway surface (pH=~7 to 7.4) or causing
acidification of the airway surface following deposition in the lung. The use of bicarbonate anion
as a buffering agent may be particularly useful, given its natural role as a buffering agent on the
airway surface, and its depletion in diseases associated or caused by CFTR dysfunction such as
CF and COPD.
[1212]      The buffering agent can be any compound comprising an anionic component which is
able to maintain a pH from about 6.8 to about 7.6. In one embodiment, the anionic component is
able to maintain a pH from about 6.9 to about 7.5.             In another embodiment, the anionic
component is able to maintain a pH from about 7.0 to about 7.4.            Examples of the anionic
component include, but are not limited to, carbonate (C0     2-) and bicarbonate (HCO 3-). Examples
                                                           3
of the buffering agent include, but are not limited to, any alkali metal and alkaline earth metal
salt of carbonate and bicarbonate, such as sodium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, potasium
carbonate, potasium bicarbonate, calcium carbonate, calcium bicarbonate, magnesium carbonate,
magnesium bicarbonate, lithium carbonate, and lithium bicarbonate.
[1213]      There are two key considerations that link HCO 3- as a buffer to CFTR. First, recent
findings indicate that, although the relative ratio of HCO3- conductance/ Cl- conductance is
between 0.1 and 0.2 for single CFTR channels activated with cAMP and ATP, the ratio in the
sweat duct can range from virtually 0 to almost 1.0, depending on conditions of stimulation. That
is, combining cAMP + cGMP + a-ketoglutarate can yield CFTR HCO3- conductance almost
equal to that of Cl- conductance (Quiton et al. Physiology, 22(3):212-225 (2007)). Therefore,
CFTR conducts HCO3, and hence CF airway surfaces may be HCO3- depleted, or acidic, and in
need of replacement therapy. Second, absent CFTR-dependent bicarbonate secretion can lead to
chronic airway surface acidification and impaired capacity of CF airways to respond to airway
conditions associated with acute acidification of airway surface liquid layer e.g. gastric acid
inspiration (Coakley et al., Proc Nat Acad Sci USA, 100(26):16083-8 (2003)).

    WO 2013/163517                                                            PCT/US2013/038368
[1214]        Buffering Systems Used as Excipients to Prevent Decrease in Airway Surface pH
Consequent to Deposition of Hyperosmolar Solution on Airway Surface
[1215]        Administration of hyperosmolar agents, such as 7% HS, on the airway surface can
cause a transient decrease in the pH of the airway surface liquid layer (ASL). This transient
decrease in pH may cause additional irritation to the airways. Therefore, it may be beneficial to
co-formulate hyperosmolar agents with buffering excipients. This approach is especially relevant
for diseases associated with CFTR dysfunction, as CFTR-dependent HCO3 conductance
contributes significantly to the buffering of the airway surface as described above.
[1216]        The hyperosmolar agents deposited as aerosols on the airway surface cause a
transepithelial efflux of water onto the airway surface. Water added to ambient ASL will rapidly
equilibrate with atmospheric CO 2 gas [C0 2 (g)     -> C0 2 (l)] which will rapidly form carbonic acid
[C0 2 (l) + H 2 0(l) -> H 2 CO 3 (1)]. Subsequently, the carbonic acid can lower the pH of the ASL
[H 2 CO 3 (l) -> HCO3 + H 3 0']. To maintain the pH of the ASL, bicarbonate anions can be
secreted from the airway epithelial cells via CFTR.
[1217]        When a hyperosmolar agent is deposited on the airway surfaces at sufficiently high
rates, which can cause rapid efflux of water onto the airway surface, the rapid equilibration of
CO 2 in the ASL and the subsequent ASL acidification can exceed the rate of buffering ion
(HCO3-) secretion from the airway epithelium. Hence, a drop in pH can occur. This phenomenon
may be exacerbated in human subjects with decreased CFTR function, such as in CF or COPD
patients.
[1218]        Formulations of hyperosmolar agents with buffering excipients of sufficient buffering
capacities can be identified, so that the acidification of the ASL is attenuated or completely
prevented.      Exemplary buffer systems can comprise, but are not limited to, carbonic
acid/carbonate/bicarbonate-based buffers; disodium hydrogen phthalate / sodium dihydrogen
orthophosphate-based buffers; tris (hydroxylmethyl) aminomethane / hydrochloric acid-based
buffers; barbitone sodium / hydrochloric acid-based buffers; and any combination thereof.
[1219]        Due to these data, inclusion of bicarbonate anion in the formulation of 7% or >7%
hypertonic saline administered by the disclosed methods would be particularly useful.
Formulations containing up to 1 to 200 mM concentrations of bicarbonate anions are of
particular interest for 7% or >7% HS solutions.
[1220]        Also contemplated to be useful with disclosed embodiments are chemically modified
osmolytes or osmolyte precursors. Such chemical modifications involve linking to the osmolyte
(or precursor) an additional chemical group which alters or enhances the effect of the osmolyte
or osmolyte precursor (e.g., inhibits degradation of the osmolyte molecule). Such chemical
                                                  61

modifications have been utilized with drugs or prodrugs and are known in the art. (See, for
example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,479,932 and 4,540,564; Shek, E. et al., J. Med. Chem. 19:113-117

[1221]      Buffering Systems Used as Excipients to Normalize the Airway Surface pH
[1222]      CFTR dysfunction leading to airways surface acidification, likely due to the
dependence of bicarbonate secretion on CFTR function, has been described in several respiratory
diseases including CF and COPD. CF airways surface liquid (ASL) has been shown to be more
acidic, compared to the ASL from healthy subjects (Coakley et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA,
100(26):16083-8 (2003)). Similar abnormalities may occur in COPD. For this reason, it may be
beneficial to co-formulate any therapeutic agent, administered to patients suffering from low
airway surface liquid pH, with a buffering reagent/excipient of sufficient strength that would
normalize the airway surface liquid pH. This approach is also applicable to diseases with
decreased airway surface pH due to other causes than CFTR dysfunction, e.g. inflammation
and/or infection.
[1223]      Buffering Systems Used as Excipients to Prevent Decrease in Airway Surface pH
Following Administrations of Acidic Aerosols.
[1224]      Administration of large volumes of unbuffered aerosols on the airway surface can
cause a transient decrease in the pH of the airway surface liquid layer (ASL). This transient
decrease in pH may cause additional irritation to the airways. Therefore, it may be beneficial to
co-formulate any aerosolized drug product with buffering excipients, providing sufficient
maintenance of the pH of the aerosol in the neutral range and preventing decreases in the pH of
the ASL upon aerosol deposition.
[1225]      The pharmaceutical formulation is aerosolized by an inhalation delivery device for
transnasal delivery. The inhalation delivery device is capable of generating an aerosol having
particle size suitable for effectively passing the upper respiratory airways, such as the nasal
passway.    For example, the aerosol particles for inhalation have a volume median diameter
(VMD) from about 0.5 gm to about 2.5 gin, or about 1 gm to about 2 gm; or about 1.2 gm to
about 1.6 gin. As the aerosol particles contain an active agent, e.g., hypertonic saline, and a
buffering agent, the size thereof can grow as they pass through the respiratory airways during
inhalation process to become more effectively deposited to the lower respiratory airways, such as
lung airway surfaces. In one embodiment, the aerosol particle size can grow as much as about
                                              62

   WO 2013/163517                                                           PCT/US2013/038368
50% to about 150%, or about 70% to about 130%, or about 80% to about 120%, or about 100%
from the initial nasal inhalation of the aerosol to the delivery of the aerosol to the lung airway
surfaces.
[1226]      Sodium Channel Blockers
[1227]      Coordinated ion transport by the airway epithelia directly regulates the hydration
level of the mucosal surface.     Importantly, sodium absorption through the epithelial sodium
channel (ENaC) provides the rate-limiting step in hydration. In human subjects with loss of
function, mutation in ENaC have 'wet' airway surfaces and extraordinarily fast mucous
clearance (see above) (Kerem et al., N. Engl. J Med. 341(3):156-62 (1999)).             Conversely,
increased sodium absorption through ENaC has been shown to be the underlying cause of
mucous dehydration and the formation of mucous plugs in the lungs of CF patients.
Furthermore, transgenic mice that overexpress ENaC in the lungs have dehydrated airway
surfaces and reduced/absent mucous clearance that results in death (Hummler et al., Proc. Natl.
Acad. Sci. USA 94(21):11710-5 (1997)).         As predicted from clinical and experimental data,
pharmacological blockade of ENaC conserves liquid on airway surfaces and increases mucus
clearance (Hirsh et al., J Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 325(1):77-88 (2008)). Particular examples
include, but are not limited to:
[1228]      Small molecule channel blockers: Small molecule ENaC blockers are capable of
directly preventing sodium transport through the ENaC channel pore. ENaC blockers that can be
administered by the disclosed methods include, but are not limited to, amiloride, benzamil,
phenamil, and amiloride analogues as exemplified by US Pat. No. 6,858,614, US Pat. No.

[1229]      Protease inhibitors: ENaC proteolysis is well described to increase sodium transport
through ENaC. Protease inhibitors block the activity of endogenous airway proteases, thereby
preventing ENaC cleavage and activation. Protease that cleave ENaC include furin, meprin,
matriptase, trypsin, channel associated proteases (CAPs), and neutrophil elastases.        Protease
inhibitors that can inhibit the proteolytic activity of these proteases that can be administered by

polynucleic acid) can be used to carry out the disclosed embodiments, including but not limited
to, antisense oligonucleotide, siRNA, miRNA, miRNA mimic, antagomir, ribozyme, aptamer,
and decoy oligonucleotide nucleic acids.       See, e.g., US Patent Application Publication No.
20100316628. In general, such nucleic acids may be from 17 or 19 nucleotides in length, up to
23, 25 or 27 nucleotides in length, or more.
[1231]      Any suitable siRNA active agent can be used to carry out the disclosed embodiments.
Examples include, but are not limited to, those described in US Patent No. 7,517,865 and US
Patent Applications Nos. 20100215588; 20100316628; 20110008366; and 20110104255. In
general, the siRNAs are from 17 or 19 nucleotides in length, up to 23, 25 or 27 nucleotides in
length, or more.
[1232]      Secretagogues
[1233]      Mutations in the cystic fibrosis (CF) gene result in abnormal ion transport across the
respiratory epithelium (Matsui et al., Cell 95:1005-15 (1998)). Excessive absorption of sodium
and the inability to secrete chloride by the airway epithelium in patients with CF drives water
absorption down an osmotic gradient generated by inappropriate salt absorption, dehydrating
airway mucous secretions and reducing the volume of liquid in the PCL. In COPD, cigarette
smoke impairs CFTR function, thus creating an acquired phenotype similar to CF.
[1234]      P2Y2 Receptor Agonists: Agents that that may be administered by the disclosed
methods include a group of P2Y 2 agonists. Purinergic (P2Y 2) receptors are abundant on luminal
surface of human bronchial epithelium (HBE) and are known to stimulate Cl secretion and
inhibit Na' absorption (Goralski et al., Curr. Opin. Pharmacol., 10(3):294-9 (2010)).
[1235]      Native agonists of P2Y 2 receptors are susceptible to enzymatic hydrolysis in vivo by a
class of extracellular enzymes called ecto-nucleotidases (Lazarowski et al., J Biol. Chem.
279(35):36855-64 (2004)) that are present on human epithelial surfaces. Consequently, these
agonists have very short half-lives. Given the enzymatic degradation of native agonists as well as
engineered nucleotide-based P2Y 2 agonists, ectonucleotidase inhibitors such as ebselen can be
administered by the disclosed methods in order to prolong half-lives of endogenous (e.g., ATP)
or exogenously delivered P2Y 2 agonists.
[1236]      P2Y 2 agonists that can be administered by the disclosed methods include P2Y 2
receptor agonists such as ATP, UTP, UTP-y-S and dinucleotide P2Y 2 receptor agonists (e.g.,
denufosol or diquafosol) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof-. The P2Y 2 receptor

[1238]      Activators of Alternative Chloride Channels such as CaCCs and CIC-2 Class
Channels: CaCCs are broadly expressed in mammalian cells where they are involved in a wide
range of physiological functions, including transepithelial fluid secretion, oocyte fertilization,
olfactory and sensory signal transduction, smooth muscle contraction, and neuronal and cardiac
excitation. Single channel analysis has suggested four or more distinct CaCC subclasses, with a
wide range of reported single channel conductances from less than 2 pS in cardiac myocytes to
50 pS in airway epithelial cells.
[1239]      The consequences of CaCC activation are cell type specific, for example, chloride
secretion in epithelial cells, action potential generation in olfactory receptor neurons, smooth
muscle contraction, and prevention of polyspermia in oocytes. Although CaCCs were
functionally characterized nearly three decades ago, their molecular identity has remained
unclear until recently, with potential candidates including bestrophins (BEST1-BEST4) (Sun et
al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 99:4008-4013 (2002)) and Tsunenari et al., J Biol. Chem.
278:41114-41125 (2003), the calcium activated chloride channel ClCA family proteins (Gruber
et al., Genomics 54:200-214 (1998)) and ClC3 (Huang P et al., "Regulation of human CLC-3
channels by multifunctional Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase", JBC 276: 20093-100
(2001)).
[1240]      Three independent laboratories have identified TMEM16A, also called anoctamin 1,
as a strong candidate for a CaCC (Yang YD et al., "TMEM16A confers receptor-activated
calcium-dependent chloride conductance", Nature 455: 1210-15 (2008); Caputo A et al.,
"TMEM16A, a membrane protein associated with calcium-dependent chloride channel activity-",
Science- 322: 590-4 (2008); Schroeder BC et al., "Expression cloning of TMEM16A as a
calcium-activated chloride channel subunit", Cell 134:1019-29 (2008)).
[1241]      ClC2is a ubiquitously expressed, inwardly rectifying chloride channel that is
activated by cell swelling. Suitable alternative chloride channel activators are described in U.S.

[1242]      Modulatorsof CFTR activity: The hereditary lethal disease CF is caused by mutations
in the gene encoding CFTR protein, a cAMP activated chloride channel expressed in the airway
epithelia. Various mutations in CFTR cause ion transport dysfunction by limiting the chloride

    WO 2013/163517                                                         PCT/US2013/038368
ion secretion to the surface of the airway epithelium via CFTR and by dys-regulation of sodium
ion absorption, leading to excessive absorption of sodium cations. These defects in ion transport
result in impaired hydration of airway surface liquid layer, decrease in mucus clearance and lead
to progressive loss of lung function. Recently, it has been shown that CFTR functional defects
are present in cigarette smoke exposed tissue, thus implying the role of CFTR dysfunction in
COPD.
[1243]      Over 1500 putative mutations have been described in CFTR, which can be divided
into classes according to the molecular mechanism of the genetic defect (Rowe et al., Pulm.
Pharmacol. Ther., 23(4):268-78 (2010)). An understanding of the biology of each of these
mutations has led to therapeutic strategies based on the particular mutation type. Class I
mutations include premature termination codons (PTCs, e.g. nonsense mutations) within the
coding region of CFTR. Class II CFTR mutations include F508del CFTR, the most common
mutation in humans. Class III and IV CFTR mutations are characterized by full-length CFTR
that reaches the cell surface but exhibit reduced ion transport activity owing to abnormal channel
gating (Class III, e.g. G551D) or reduced conductivity of the ion channel pore (Class IV, e.g.
RI 17H). Similarly, splicing mutants (Class V) and mutations within the C-terminus (Class VI)
are also full length, but exhibit reduced activity owing to reduced numbers of active channels
within the plasma membrane. The classification of CFTR mutants can be simplified into the
therapeutically relevant groups based on the activity of agents in development.
[1244]      Potentiators of cell-surface cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator
CFTR mutation classes that result in dysfunctional CFTR that resides at the plasma membrane
include Class III, IV, V, and VI mutations and represent potential targets for CFTR activators.
[1245]      CFTR activity modulating compounds that can be administered by the disclosed
methods include, but are not limited to, VX-809, VX-770, VX-661 and compounds described in

[1246]      Mucus/Mucin Modifying Agents
[1247]      Reducing Agents: Mucin proteins are organized into high molecular weight polymers
via the formation of covalent (disulfide) and non-covalent bonds. Disruption of the covalent
bonds with reducing agents is a well-established method to reduce the viscoelastic properties of
mucus in vitro and is predicted to minimize mucus adhesiveness and improve clearance in vivo.
Reducing agents are well known to decrease mucus viscosity in vitro and commonly used as an

aid to processing sputum samples (Hirsch, S.R., Zastrow, J.E., and Kory, R.C. , "Sputum
liquefying agents: a comparative in vitro evaluation-", J. Lab. Clin. Med. 74:346-353, 1969).
Examples of reducing agents include sulfide containing molecules capable of reducing protein
disulfide bonds including, but not limited to, N-acetyl cysteine, cystamine, N-acystelyn,
carbocysteine, glutathione, dithiothreitol and thioredoxin containing proteins.
[1248]       Administration of NAC according to the disclosed methods allows an increase in the
daily pulmonary dose (to increase efficacy), while decreasing the rate of presentation (to improve
tolerability). With administration of NAC via aerosol infusion, the concentration of NAC on the
airway surface can be maintained, despite rapid clearance and metabolism.            Thus, by the
disclosed methods, the duration of action of NAC on the airway surface will be extended.
Deposition of NAC on the surface of the lung according to the disclosed methods can achieve
this effect at rates of 0.005 mg/min to 5.4 mg/min over extended 8 hour aerosol administration
and can allow for improved efficacy of NAC.
[1249]       Surfactants and Detergents: Surfactants and detergents are spreading agents shown
to decrease mucus viscoelasticity, improving mucus clearability.         Examples of surfactants
include DPPC, PF, palmitic acid, palmitoyl-oleoylphosphatidylglycerol, surfactant proteins (e.g.
SP-A, B, or C), or may be animal derived (e.g. from cow or calf lung lavage or extracted from
minced pig lung) or combinations thereof . See, e.g., US Patent Nos. 7,897,577; 5,876,970;
5,614,216; 5,100,806; and 4,312,860.         Examples of surfactant products include Exosurf,
Pumactant, KL-4, Venticute, Alveofact, Curosurf, Infasurf, and Survanta.             Examples of
detergents include, but are not limited to, Tween-80 and triton-X 100. Surfactants may be used
to clear adherent secretions from the lung and/or prevent apposion of upper airway surfaces that
produce obstructive sleep apnea.
[1250]       Buffering agents to increase the activity of reducing agents.       Thiol containing
agents, such as N-acetylcysteine, exhibit increased reducing activity as the pH environment
approaches or exceeds the pKa of the sulfur moiety. The pH of the airway surface is maintained
at ~7.4 and is reported be more acidic in diseased airways such as CF (Jayaraman S, Song Y,
Vetrivel L, Shankar L, Verkman AS," Noninvasive in vivo fluorescence measurement of airway
surface liquid depth, salt concentration, and pH", J Clin. Invest., 107(3):317-24 (2001)). As the
pK, of the NAC sulfur moiety is 9.5, NAC is only partially active in the pH environment of the
lung surface.      Thus, NAC administered (by the disclosed methods) in combination with
sufficient amounts of a buffering agent to raise the ASL pH, will increase the therapeutic
potential of NAC.
[1251]       Expectorants: Any suitable expectorant can be used, including but not limited to
guaifenesin (see, e.g., US Patent No. 7,345,051).

[1252]      DNase: Any suitable deoxyribonuclease can be used, including but not limited to
Dornase Alpha- (see, e.g., US Patent No. 7,482,024).
[1253]      Exemplary Anti-infective Agents
[1254]      Chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases are accompanied by both acute and chronic
bacterial infections. Both acute and chronic infections lead to chronic inflammation that has
acute flare-ups in the form of pulmonary exacerbations. The underlying inflammation is treated
with a variety of inhaled anti-inflammatory agents.       For example, in cystic fibrosis the most
common bacteria causing chronic infection is Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) and
antibiotics that are effective against this bacteria are a major component of treatment (Flume,
Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 176(10):957-69 (2007)). Also bacteria such as Staphylococcus
aureus (S. aureus), Burkholderia cepacia (B. cepacia) and other gram negative organisms as
well as anaerobes are isolated from respiratory secretions and people with CF may benefit from
treatment of these pathogens to maintain their lung health. Anaerobic bacteria are also
recognized as a feature of CF airways, sinuses in subjects with chronic sinusitis, and likely
airways of subjects with COPD. Similarly, aspirations or microaspirations, especially in the
elderly population and during sleep, are associated with a chemical pneumonitis, anaerobic
infections and subsequent bronchiectasis. An ideal treatment of aspiration-related pneumonitis
and anaerobic infection would be an immediate treatment. As such, antibiotics are used to
eradicate early infections, during pulmonary exacerbations and as chronic suppressive therapy.
[1255]      The primary measure of antibiotic activity is the minimum inhibitory concentration
(MIC). The MIC is the lowest concentration of an antibiotic that completely inhibits the growth
of a microorganism in vitro. While the MIC is a good indicator of the potency of an antibiotic, it
indicates nothing about the time course of antimicrobial activity. PK parameters quantify the
lung tissue level time course of an antibiotic. The three pharmacokinetic parameters that are most
important for evaluating antibiotic efficacy are the peak tissue level (Cmax), the trough level
(Cmin), and the Area Under the tissue concentration time Curve (AUC). While these parameters
quantify the tissue level time course, they do not describe the killing activity of an antibiotic.
[1256]      Integrating the PK parameters with the MIC gives us three PK/PD parameters which
quantify the activity of an antibiotic: the Peak/MIC ratio, the T>MIC, and the 24h-AUC/MIC
ratio. The Peak/MIC ratio is simply the Cpmax divided by the MIC. The T>MIC (time above
MIC) is the percentage of a dosage interval in which the serum level exceeds the MIC. The 24h
AUC/MIC ratio is determined by dividing the 24-hour-AUC by the MIC. The three
pharmacodynamic properties of antibiotics that best describe killing activity are time
dependence, concentration-dependence, and persistent effects. The rate of killing is determined
                                                68

    WO 2013/163517                                                           PCT/US2013/038368
by either the length of time necessary to kill (time-dependent), or the effect of increasing
concentrations (concentration-dependent). Persistent effects include the Post-Antibiotic Effect
(PAE). PAE is the persistent suppression of bacterial growth following antibiotic exposure.
[1257]      Using these parameters, antibiotics can be divided into 3 categories (see Table 8):
                                 Table 8: Categories of Antibodies

[1258]      For Type I antibiotics (aminoglycosides (AG''s), fluoroquinolones, daptomycin and
the ketolides), the ideal dosing regimen would maximize concentration, because the higher the
concentration, the more extensive and the faster is the degree of killing. Therefore, the 24h
AUC/MIC ratio, and the Peak/MIC ratio are important predictors of antibiotic efficacy. For
aminoglycosides, it is best to have a Peak/MIC ratio of at least 8-10 to prevent resistence. For
fluoroquinolones vs gram negative bacteria, the optimal 24h-AUC/MIC ratio is approximately
125. Versus gram positives, 40 appears to be optimal. However, the ideal 24h-AUC/MIC ratio for
fluoroquinolones varies widely in the literature.
[1259]      Type    II  antibiotics   (beta-lactams,    cephalosporins,  clindamycin,  erythromcyin,
carbapenems and linezolid) demonstrate the complete opposite properties. The ideal dosing
regimen for these antibiotics maximizes the duration of exposure. The T>MIC is the parameter
that best correlates with efficacy. For beta-lactams and erythromycin, maximum killing is seen
when the time above MIC is at least 70% of the dosing interval.
[1260]      Type    III antibiotics    (oxazolidinones,    vancomycin, tetracyclines,   azithromycin,
clindamycin and the dalfopristin-quinupristin combination) have mixed properties, they have
                                                  69

    WO 2013/163517                                                         PCT/US2013/038368
time-dependent killing and moderate persistent effects. The ideal dosing regimen for these
antibiotics maximizes the amount of drug received. Therefore, the 24h-AUC/MIC ratio is the
parameter that correlates with efficacy. For vancomycin, a 24h-AUC/MIC ratio of at least 125 is
necessary.
[1261]      Given the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties for Type II and Type III
antibiotics, administration by aerosol "infusion" will improve the efficacy for such agents. For
example, carbapenam antibiotics are susceptible to enzymatic hydrolysis in vivo by the enzyme
dehydropeptidase-I, thus leading to a short elimination half-life (less than 2 hr).        The best
measure of efficacy of this class of antibiotics is based on the minimum percentage of time the
drug concentration is above the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) in the target tissue.
Most dose regimens target a time above the MIC (TaM) of at least 50%, thus the need for a
continuous infusion.     High systemic concentrations of carbapenems can have proconvulsive
effects and renal and liver toxicity.
[1262]      Delivering carbapenems via continuous aerosol to the lungs of patients in need can
allow for a safe and convenient way to maintain a high TaM in the lungs while reducing potential
for systemic side effects. 500 mg to 2,000 mg of inhaled meropenem administered BID in 4 ml of
normal saline via Pari LC jet nebulizers may be used for treatment of CF bacterial infections.
Such administrations occur at a rate of 6.7 mg/min to 26.7 mg/min of meropenem deposited in the
airway surface during two 15 minute nebulization periods per day. A 20 mg to 1,200 mg dose of
meropenem, deposited in the lung of CF patients per day and administered at a rate between 0.04
mg/min to 2.5 mg/min of meropenem deposited in the airway surface during 8 hour or longer
extended aerosol administration according to the disclosed methods, can allow for better
combined safety, tolerability and efficacy outcomes. Patients including, but not limited to, CF,
COPD, non-CF bronchiectasis, aspiration pneumonia, asthma and VAP patients suffering from
respiratory infection caused by bacteria susceptible to meropenem may benefit from such
treatment. Examples     of carbapenam antibiotics       are: imipenam, panipenam,       meropenam,
doripenem, biapenam, MK-826, DA-1131, ER-35786, lenapenam, S-4661, CS-834 (prodrug of R
95867), KR-21056 (prodrug of KR-21012), L-084 (prodrug of LJC 11036) and CXA-101.
[1263]      Delivering class III antibiotics via continuous aerosol to the lungs of patients in need
can allow for a safe and convenient way to maintain a high 24h-AUC/MIC in the lungs while
reducing potential for systemic side effects. For example, 20 to 1,200 mg of vancomycin
deposited in the lung of patients per day and administered at a rate between 0.04 mg/min to 2.5
mg/min of vancomycin deposited on the airway surface during 8 hour or longer extended aerosol
administration according to disclosed methods, can allow for better combined safety, tolerability
and efficacy outcomes compared to rapid inhaled delivery or IV infusion. Patients including, but

aerosol inhalation over extended periods of time according to the disclosed methods are listed in

[1265]      Exemplary Anti-Inflammatory Agents
[1266]      Inhaled corticosteroids are the standard of chronic care for asthma, COPD and other
respiratory diseases characterized by acute and chronic inflammation leading to airflow
                                               71

    WO 2013/163517                                                           PCT/US2013/038368
limitation. Examples of corticosteroids suitable for administration by the disclosed methods
include, but are not limited to, beclomethasone, budesonide, and fluticasone. NSAIDs are a
group of anti-inflammatory medications that do not contain steroids. NSAIDs do not carry the
same risk of side effects as steroidal anti-inflammatory medications, but with long-term use, they
may cause internal bleeding or kidney problems.
[1267]      Products of arachidonic acid metabolism, specifically the leukotrienes (LTs),
contribute to pulmonary inflammation. Cysteinylleukotrienes (LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4) are
produced predominantly by eosinophils, mast cells, and macrophages. Examples of leukotriene
modifiers suitable for administration by the disclosed methods include, but are not limited to,
monteleukastzileuton and zafirlukast.
[1268]      Mast cell stabilizers     are cromone medications such as cromolyn (sodium
cromoglycate) used to prevent or control certain allergic disorders. They block a calcium channel
essential for mast cell degranulation, stabilizing the cell and thereby preventing the release of
histamine and related mediators. As inhalers they are used to treat asthma, as nasal sprays to treat
hay fever (allergic rhinitis) and as eye drops for allergic conjunctivitis. Finally, in oral form they
are used to treat the rare condition of mastocytosis.
[1269]      PDE4 inhibitors have been shown to modulate pulmonary inflammation and used for
treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases. Examples of PDE4 inhibitors suitable for
administration by the disclosed methods include, but are not limited to, theophylline and
roflumilast.
[1270]      Exemplary Bronchodilators
[1271]      NO, NO Donors, NO and Peroxynitrite Scavengers and Inducible NO Synthase
Activity Modulators: Nitric oxide (NO) is a potent endogenous vasodilator and bronchodilator
that can be exogenously administered via inhalation. It is synthesized by the conversion of the
terminal guanidine nitrogen atom of L-arginine via the endothelial cell calcium dependent
enzyme nitric oxide synthetase and then diffuses across the cell membrane to activate the
enzyme     guanylatecyclase.    This   enzyme     enhances the synthesis of cyclic           guanosine
monophosphate (cGMP), causing relaxation of vascular and bronchial smooth muscle and
vasodilation of blood vessels (Palmer, Circ. Res., 82(8):852-61 (1998)).
[1272]      Nitric oxide synthesised in endothelial cells that line blood vessels has a wide range
of functions that are vital for maintaining healthy respiratory and cardiovascular systems
(Megson, IL et al., Expert Opin. Investig. Drugs 11(5):587-601 (2002)). Reduced nitric oxide
availability is implicated in the initiation and progression of many diseases and delivery of
supplementary nitric oxide to help prevent disease progression is an attractive therapeutic option.
                                                 72

    WO 2013/163517                                                          PCT/US2013/038368
Nitric oxide donor drugs represent a useful means of systemic nitric oxide delivery and organic
nitrates have been used for many years as effective therapies for symptomatic relief from angina.
However, nitrates have limitations and a number of alternative nitric oxide donor classes have
emerged since the discovery that nitric oxide is a crucial biological mediator.
[1273]      Examples of NO, NO donors and NO synthase activity modulators suitable for
administration by the disclosed methods include inhaled NO, inhaled NaNO 2 , agents disclosed in
Vallance et al., Fundam. Clin. Pharmacol., 17(1):1-10 (2003), Al-Sa'doni HH et al., Mini Rev.
Med. Chem., 5(3):247-54 (2005), Miller MR et al., Br. J Pharmacol., 151(3):305-21 (2007).
Epub 2007 Apr 2 and Katsumi H et al. Cardiovasc. Hematol. Agents Med. Chem., 5(3):204-8
(2007).
[1274]      Under certain conditions, inducible NO synthase activity leads to overproduction of
NO which in turn increases inflammation and tissue injury. Under these conditions, the
following inducible NO synthase inhibitors, NO scavengers and peroxynitrite scavengers
administered by the disclosed methods are         suitable: Bonnefous et al., J. Med. Chem., 52
(9):3047-3062 (2009), Muscara et al AJP - GI 276 (6 ):G1313-G1316 (1999) or Hansel et al.
FASEB Journal,17:1298-1300 (2003).
[1275]      Beta 2-adrenergic receptor agonists: It has been established that administration of
super-therapeutic concentrations of receptor agonists leads to receptor desensitization and loss of
efficacy. For example, this phenomenon has been described for beta 2-adrenoceptor based
bronchodilator agents (Duringer et al., Br. J Pharmacol., 158(1):169-79 (2009)).              High
concentration of these receptor agonist agents leads to the receptor phosphorylation,
internalization and potential degradation. Administration of receptor agonists, which cause
tachyphylaxis following bolus administration via fast nebulizer, by inhalation over the course of
8 to 24 hours or overnight to a patient via nasal cannula improves the efficacy of such agents due
to decreased extent of tachyphylaxis. Beta 2-adrenergic receptor agonists include, but are not
limited   to, albuterol,  levalbuterol,   salbutamol,    procaterol,  terbutaline, pirbuterol, and
metaproterenol.
[1276]      Other Exemplary Therapeutic Agents
[1277]      Examples of other classes of therapeutic agents suitable for administration by the
disclosed methods include antivirals such as ribavirin, anti-fungal agents such as amphotericin,
intraconazol and voriconazol, immunosuppressants, anti-rejection drugs such as cyclosporine,
tacrolimus and sirolimus, bronchodilators including but not limited to anticholinergic agents such
as ipratropium, tiotropium, aclidinium and others, PDE5 inhibitors, gene therapy vectors,
aptamers, endothelin-receptor antagonists, alpha-i -antitrypsin, prostacyclins, vaccines, PDE-4

fluticasone, memetasone and triamcinolone.
[1278]      DRUG CLASSES SUITABLE FOR ADMINISTRATION VIA TPAD-BASED
DEVICES TARGETTING EXTRA-PULMONARY TISSUES
[1279]      It is well recognized that pulmonary drug delivery is an alternative means to target
extra-pulmonary tissues.     Systemic administration of therapeutic agents by the tPAD-based
devices is useful only in cases when such therapy can be formulated in a manner that allows
reaching therapeutically effective levels in the extra-pulmonary tissues of interest.
[1280]      Pulmonary administration can by-pass issues associated with oral, transdermal,
sublingual, IV, i.m., i.p and other injectable drug administration. For example, injection or IV
administration cause pain and subjects the individual to infections at the injection site.
Furthermore, aerosol delivery of drugs is advantageous to oral administration particularly for
therapeutic agents that are poorly orally available or inactivated by first-pass metabolism.
[1281]      The administration of therapeutic agents intended to target non-pulmonary issues by
the disclosed methods is advantageous in that it can (1) overcome the limitations of oral or IV
administration; and (2) it can be utilized to control the pharmacokinetic profile (e.g. blood levels
over time) of the therapeutic agent.
[1282]      An example of therapies particularly suitable for administration by the tPAD-based
device platform include inhaled insulin for diabetes, inhaled dihydroergotamine for acute
migraine, inhaled morphine for palliative care, and sleep agents for dyspnea.
[1283]      An example of current IV therapies suitable for tPAD-based device administration
include    inotropic treatments for chronic congestive heart failure [Amrinone (Inocor@),
Digitoxin (Crystodigin@), Digoxin (Lanoxin@, Lanoxicaps@), Dobutamine (Dobutrex@) or
Milrinone (Primacor@)] and others.
