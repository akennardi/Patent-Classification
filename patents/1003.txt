DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0014]    A vascular treatment device may be used for ablating blood vessels, such as varicose
veins, and for treating thrombosis by macerating a clot and injecting a thrombolytic drug, among
other uses. A vascular treatment device may include a rotatable wire, so sized and shaped for
ablating blood vessels, coupled to a cartridge that is engageable to a handle. The wire may thus
be indirectly engaged with a motor in the handle such that the wire rotates when the motor is
turned on. When the device is used for treating a varicose vein, the rotating wire may perturb the
vessel to cause vasospasm, a condition in which blood vessels spasm, and may cause damage to
the vessel wall to promote sclerosis. During a thrombectomy procedure, the wire may macerate a
clot without causing damage to the vessel wall.
[0015]    FIG. 1 shows an embodiment of an assembly of a vascular treatment device 10 having a
handle 12 and a cartridge 14. The cartridge 14 may be so sized and shaped to engage to the
handle 12 by fitting one component to another as shown. An embodiment of the handle 12 is
shown in greater detail in FIG. 3. The

                                                         -2
handle may define a receptacle 29 in which the male coupling 30 is positioned to receive the female coupling
40 of the cartridge 14 when the cartridge 14 and the handle 12 engage. The handle 12 may include a motor
22, a trigger 26, and a male coupling 30. The male coupling 30 may be connected to the motor 22 in such a
way that the motor rotably drives the male coupling upon activation. A potentiometer 24 may be electrically
coupled to the motor 22 to control a speed of the motor. The trigger 26 may be mounted on the handle and
transitionable between a first state, which does not couple the motor to a power source electrically, and a
second state, which couples the motor to a power source.
[00161    The handle 12 may also include a power source 20 and a microswitch 28 connected to the motor 22
by a wire 32. The microswitch 28 may be interposed in an electrical circuit connecting the trigger 26 and the
motor 22. The microswitch may be biased to an open position such that the circuit between the trigger and the
motor is open. When the cartridge 14 is engaged in the handle 12, the cartridge may press against the
microswitch, causing it to transition to a closed state, thereby completing the electrical circuit connecting the
trigger 26 and motor 22. For example, the microswitch may include two contacts with a conductor that is
attached to one contact and disconnected from the second contact when the microswitch is in an open state. In
one embodiment, the conductor may include a strip of metal that hangs in the channel into which the cartridge
is slid during engagement with the handle. As the cartridge is engaged in the handle, it pushes the metal strip
out of the channel and into connection with the second contact of the microswitch. One advantage gained
from such configuration may be that a user will not be able to activate the device inadvertently by pressing on
the trigger before he/she is ready to use the device, i.e., before the cartridge 14 is fully engaged to the handle
12.
[0017J    The handle may 12 also include a switch 16 as shown in FIG. 3. The switch 16 allows the cartridge
14 to be received by, and secured in, the handle 12. The switch may include a grip 15 to permit a user to
operate the switch with a finger. The switch may also include a gate 17 that alternately obstructs or locks the
cartridge, depending on the gate's position. For example, a user may put a thumb on the grip 15 and push the
switch 16 away from the handle grip 25 to transition the switch 16 from a first position, in which gate 17 is
positioned in the channel and so prevents engagement of the cartridge 12 and the handle 14, to a second
position in which gate 17 is moved out of the channel and thereby permits engagement of the cartridge and the
handle. Upon release of the biased switch 16, the gate 17 may fit into a complementary detent in the cartridge
and thereby help keep the cartridge engaged with the handle.
[0018]    The gate 17 may be biased to the first position by a spring 23 contacting the handle. As the user
pushes the switch 16 away from the handle grip 25, the switch 16 will push on the spring, thereby creating a
restoring force to urge the switch to its original position once the user releases the switch.
[00191    As noted above, the gate 17 may be further transitionable to a third position which prevents
disengagement of the cartridge 14 from the handle 12. For example, the gate 17 may be forced into the detent
35 (shown in FIG. 4), defined by the cartridge 14, when the biased switch 16 returns to its original position
from the second position to lock the cartridge to the handle.
[0020J    One or more portions of the handle 12 may define a trigger ring 18 in which the trigger is at least
partly disposed and about which the handle is so arranged as to be balanced when supported from only one or
more portions of the handle that define the trigger ring. In this manner, a user may balance the handle simply
by supporting it with a single finger, such as an index finger, against a portion of the handle that defines the

                                                        -3
trigger ring 18. As motor 22 may well be the heaviest component in the handle, it can be positioned below the
trigger 26 as shown in FIG. 3 to reduce the bending moment applied by the motor 22 on a finger supporting
the handle by the trigger ring, thereby reducing fatigue experienced by the user.
[00211    The handle 12 may be formed by joining two outer casing pieces. to
[0022J    An embodiment of the cartridge 14 shown in FIG. 1 is illustrated in greater detail in FIG. 4. The
cartridge 14 may include a female coupling 40, a wire 33 (shown as a broken line), and a sheath 32 fixed to
and extending from the cartridge 14. The wire may be fixed to the female coupling 40; for example, the wire's
proximal tip may be bent approximately 90 degrees to fit through a channel that is sized and shaped to receive
the bent end of the wire. A setscrew may be received in the female coupling 40 and/or an appropriate
adhesive may be used to secure the wire and prevent it from rotating with respect to the female coupling.
[00231    The sheath 32 may define a lumen through which the wire 33 runs. The sheath 32 may have a wide
range of inner and outer diameters. In some embodiments, the sheath may have an inner diameter in the range
of from 0.022 inches to 0.048 inches. In some embodiments, the sheath 32 may have an outer diameter in the
range of from 0.025 inches to 0.051 inches. The outer diameter of the sheath may also be in the range that is
consistent with the standard needles having corresponding inner diameters. For example, the sheath may be
so sized and shaped to be insertable in a standard needle or vascular sheath having an inner diameter in the
range of from 0.0035 inches to 0.1060 inches, or from 0.0160 inches to 0.0420 inches, or from 0.0420 inches
to 0.0630 inches, or from 0.0115 inches to 0.0630 inches. The maximum outer diameter of the sheath may be
less than 0.035 inches to allow the sheath to be inserted through a intravenous needle or catheter having an
inner diameter of less than 0.0039 inches to allow a wider range of practitioners to perform the procedure.
Needles, catheters or vascular sheaths with an outer diameter greater than 0.079 inches (6 French, Fr) or 0.092
inches (7 Fr) typically require insertion to be performed by a vascular surgeon or interventional radiologist.
[00241    The sheath 32 may also include external markings at regular intervals which may guide the user to
monitor the insertion or removal speed of the device 10.
[0025]    One exemplary embodiment depicting a reservoir connectible to the cartridge may include a syringe
44, a stopcock 46, and a plunger 48 as shown in FIG. 5. The syringe 44 may be in fluid communication with
the bore of the sheath 32 for releasing a substance at the wire distal end, such as a sclerosant (examples of
which include polidocanol, sodium tetradecyl sulfate, and hypertonic saline), or thrombolytic drug (examples
of which include alteplase (Activase), anistreplase (Eminase), streptokinase (Streptase, Kabikinase), urokinase
(Abbokinase), and tissue plasminogen activator (TPA). In this manner, physical perturbation by the wire
may be synergistically combined with drug treatment to improve device efficacy.
[0026     The handle 12 may include a support 19 (shown in FIG. 3) so positioned as to receive the syringe 44.
The support 19 may be so sized and shaped to be compatible with the standard syringes and may prevent the
syringe from falling out during injection, especially if the material being injected has high volume and/or
viscosity and requires significant user thumb pressure upon the syringe. When the cartridge 14 with an
attached syringe 44 is engaged to the handle, the syringe 44 may snap onto the support 19. As shown in FIG.
1, the support may be formed from two brackets which cradle the syringe. An alternative embodiment shown
in FIGS. 6 and 7 includes a support formed from a single hook that wraps partially around the syringe. These
embodiments allow use of the device with the right as well as left hand, depending on the user's preference
and/or the patient's position on the treatment table.

                                                         -4
[00271    The handle 12 and the syringe 44 may be so sized, shaped, and positioned as to permit a user to
actuate the trigger 26 with the index finger of a hand and simultaneously depress a plunger 48 into the syringe
with the thumb of the same hand, allowing a treatment drug to be deployed from the syringe through the
sheath while the wire 33 is rotating. For example, a user may hold the handle by positioning the handle grip
25 in the center of the pahn and wrapping third, fourth, and fifth finger around the handle grip and putting an
index finger through the trigger ring 18 and if needed, placing a thumb to depress the plunger to release
treatment drug into the syringe. The handle may be so designed to allow both right- and left-handed users to
operate.
100281    The stopcock 46 shown in FIG. 5 may allow reloading of fluid and also changing the fluid
concentration of composition as well as mixing of the sclerosant fluid with gas. For example, air can be
mixed for generating foam as well as agitating existing sclerosant/gas mixture and also recreating the foam,
because the foam has a limited duration (typically a minute or less) before the fluid and gas start to separate.
The stopcock 46 may allow the fluid composition mixture to be agitated without disconnecting the syringe
from the cartridge or without stopping the procedure.
[00291    A standard Y hemostasis connector 34 as shown in FIG. 4, or other Y hemostasis connector, may be
used to aid in fluid communication between the syringe 44 and the lumen defined by the sheath 32. A Y
hemostasis connector 34 may be connected to the female luer hub 31 and to the tubing nut 36 to prevent the
fluid from leaking into the region containing the motor 22. An O-ring may be used to prevent leaks around
the wire shaft. Wire tubing 42 may be so sized and shaped to receive the wire 33 and attached to the female
coupling 40.    Combining the above mentioned components may allow the motor to rotate the wire without
increasing the torque beyond the appropriate working range. The motor may spin in the range of from 500 to
3000 rpm - 4000 rpm for varicose vein destruction and thrombectomy procedures. The handle may also
include a built-in RPM display for user to read the speed or may include an electrical port through which the
speed may measured by an external monitor.
[0030J    The male coupling 30 on the handle 12 may be biased toward an expanded state and transitionable
from the expanded state to a contracted state. The female coupling 40 may be so sized and shaped as to
transition the male coupling 30 from the expanded state to the contracted state during engagement of the
handle 12 and the cartridge 14. As the male coupling 30 and the female coupling 40 fully engage each other,
the male coupling displaces the female coupling detents to allow the female coupling to slide within the
cartridge.
[00311    Attaching the female coupling 40 to the male coupling 30 thereby causes the sheath 32 to slide back
relative to the wire. This occurs because the sheath is fixed to the cartridge, which the wire is fixed to the
female coupling. As the cartridge is fully seated in the handle, the female coupling is pushed forward in the
cartridge. So when the female coupling 40 is not engaged by the male coupling 30, the sheath 32 may cover
the distal end of the wire 33, allowing it to be safely advanced in the patient's vasculature; and when the
female coupling 40 is engaged by the male coupling 30, the sheath may reveal the distal end of the wire.
Consequently, when the female and male couplings are engaged the distal tip of the wire is revealed, and (2)
the wire is operably coupled to the motor 22 through the female and male couplings, to allow the motor to
rotate the wire 33. As noted above, the cartridge may also trip a lever arm coupled to the microswitch 28 to
complete a circuit between the trigger 26 and the motor 22. The male coupling 30 may be so sized and shaped

                                                          -5
as to return to the expanded state once the cartridge 14 and the handle 12 are fully engaged as described
earlier.
[00321    The female coupling may be disengaged from the male coupling to re-cover the distal tip of the wire
when the wire is to be removed for the site of use, or if a treatment is interrupted. Disengaging the female
coupling from the male coupling slides the wire 33 with respect to the sheath 32 (attached to the cartridge
fixed to the handle); as a result the tip of the wire is no longer exposed, allowing it to be safely removed.
This mechanism may protect the tip of the wire 33 prior to use and also protect the blood vessels and other
body tissues during removal or repositioning of the device.
[0033J    The male coupling 30 may have at least two prongs separated by slitted portions to facilitate the
transition from the expanded state to the contracted state. The male coupling may be made with
polycarbonate, plastic, or other materials which allow transitioning between an expanded state to a contracted
state.
[00341    In some embodiments, the vascular treatment device 10 may be of a single piece construct having a
handle and a cartridge. The cartridge may be assembled to the handle during manufacturing and be able to
transition within the handle between a first position, where the male and female couplings are not engaged,
and a second position, where the male and female couplings are engaged. An embodiment of such device
may allow the cartridge to slide back and forth within a predetermined range, such as the first and the second
position, in the groove defined by the handle, but the cartridge may not disengage itself from the handle. A
sheath may be fixed and extend from the cartridge and define a lumen through which the wire runs. The
cartridge may also include a syringe to be received by a support mounted on the handle.
[0035     In this embodiment, the handle may include a motor, a motor coupling, a trigger, and a power source.
The wire having a main shaft, a distal end, and a proximal end which is fixed to the motor coupling may be
attached to the motor coupling. The motor coupling may be rotably driven by the motor. The trigger may be
mounted on the handle and be transitionable between a first state, which does not couple the motor to a power
source electrically, and a second state, which couples the motor to a power source. The handle may also
include a microswitch to permit trigger and the motor to be electrically coupled to one another.
[00361    At the first position, the cartridge may cover the distal tip of the wire. At the second position, the
cartridge (1) exposes the distal tip of the wire from the sheath, and (2) completes a circuit between the trigger
and the motor by tripping a lever arm coupled to the microswitch. Therefore, the single piece construct
vascular treatment device may allow a user to obtain similar functionality as the device explained earlier and
shown in FIG. 1.
[0037J    FIG. 6 illustrates another embodiment of vascular treatment device 10. The handle may have a
support 19 for the syringe 46 in the form of a hook, as described above. This embodiment may be assembled
by mating two casings as shown in FIG. 7. The syringe may snap onto the support and remain in position
during the use of the device. The support 19 (and/or handle 12) may be made of SLA resin or other materials
that would allow the support to withstand the snapping force applied by the syringe.
[0038J    FIG. 8 shows a top view of the end of an alternate embodiment of handle 12 having a notch 80 for
retaining the cartridge 14 (not shown) to the handle 12. In the previously mentioned embodiments, the handle
had a switch that may be coupled to a gate which held the cartridge to the handle. In this configuration, the
notch 80 may prevent the cartridge from disengaging from the handle. In use, a user may slide the cartridge

                                                        -6
into the handle and then "cock" the cartridge into notch 80 to prevent the cartridge from slipping out of the
handle.
[00391     A wide variety of distal wire tips may be used; FIGS. 9-11, 14-14A, 15-15A, 16-16A, 17-17A, 18
18A, 19-19A, 20-20A, 21-21A, 22-22A, 23, and 24 show several examples.
[00401     FIG. 9 shows an embodiment of a wire 33 having a proximal end 50, a distal end 52 and in
proximal-to-distal order, a first segment 54, a second segment 56, and a third segment 58. The first segment
54 may extend between the main shaft 51 and the second segment 56 and may be biased to a first included
angle a that is defined between the main shaft 51 and the first segment 54 and is less than 180 degrees. The
second segment 56 may extend between the first segment 54 and the third segment 58 and may be biased to a
second included angle P that is defined between the first segment 54 and the second segment 56 and is less
than 180 degrees. The third segment 58 may extend from the second segment 56 to a free end and may be
biased to a third included angle y that is defined between the second segment 56 and the third segment 58 and
is less than 180 degrees.
[0041J     The second included angle may be greater than the first included angle. The sum of the first included
angel and the third included angle, minus the second included angle, may be in the range of about 70 degrees
to about 110 degrees. The sum of the first included angle and the third included angle, minus the second
included angle may be in the range about 80 degrees to about 100 degrees. The sum of the first included
angle and the third included angle, minus the second included angle may be about 90 degrees.
[00421     The third segment 58 of the wire 33 may have a length that is smaller than the inner diameter of the
sheath 32. For example, the third segment 58 may have a length of less than 0.028 inches or it may have a
length that is equal to or smaller than two-thirds of the inner diameter of the sheath 32.
[0043J     The perpendicular distance measured from an center axis of the main shaft 51 to the free end may be
less than 0.3 inches. The first segment 54 and the second segment 56 each may have a length in the range of
about 0.2 inches to about 0.3 inches, or in the range about 0.24 inches to about 0.26 inches. The length of the
first segment 54 may be in the range of about 0.248 inches to about 0.25 inches, and the length of the second
segment is in the range of about 0.25 inches to about 0.252 inches. In one embodiment, the length of the first
segment 54 may be 0.249 inches, and the length of the second segment is 0.2504 inches.
[00441     The distal end 52 of the wire 33 may include at least two linear segments oriented at a non-zero angle
relative to one another. Having at least two linear segments may allow the distal tip of the wire to tuck into a
sheath without touching the wall of the sheath, and it may also allow the main shaft of the wire to run along
the vessel wall while the tip (for example, the third segment) of the wire digs into the vessel wall.
[0045      The wire tip located on the distal end 52 may have a wide variety of configurations, depending on the
intended use. The wire shape may be "atraumatic," meaning that it may be shaped such that insertion causes
little or no spasm or damage to the vessel. For example, FIG. 10 shows a distal end 52 terminating with a
hemispheric free end. The hemispheric end may be textured or mechanically or chemically altered to create a
roughened surface. Other atraumatic tips may include an end having a full radius, or a J-curved shape, or
simply a curved shape.
[0046J     FIG. 10 shows an atraumatic tip having a sleeve extending from the hemispheric shape along the
wire 33 towards the proximal end of the wire. The sleeve 70 can add strength to the distal tip, thereby

                                                         -7
increasing the scrapping force and increasing the contact surface area to prevent detachment of the
hemispheric tip 72.
[00471     In other embodiments, the distal tip 52 may be "aggressive" and be bent or curved so that it scrapes
the vessel wall. FIG. 9 shows the distal end 52 having a flat free end with a sharp edge around. An
aggressive distal tip 52 may also be created by beveling an edge to create a sharp point. The distal tip having
a cutting blade, like a shark's fin, may also be aggressive. The distal tip 52 may be roughened to make the
distal tip cut more aggressively and/or cause spasm to the blood vessel wall.
[00481     A roughened surface may be formed by subjecting an initially smooth steel to abrasion, machining,
blasting, chemical etching such as acid etching (for example, nitric acid, hydrofluoric acid, hydrochloric acid,
and/or sulfuric acid). A roughened outer surface may also be created by rolling a sheet metal, such as a sheet
forming the sleeve 70, onto an irregularly shaped guide to create surface irregularity.
100491 Also, the outer surfaces of the first, the second, and/or the third segments may be coated with an
abrasive to roughen the surface. Other surface treatments may include a bastard cut file type or diamond grit.
For example, 30 grit diamond may produce an aggressive surface and 200 grit diamond may produce a non
aggressive surface.
[00501     During use, especially with a roughened tip, the wire may be periodically re-encased in the sheath to
help dislodge debris from the wire tip and keep the device operating normally.
[0051J     An aggressive surface may also be formed on the first segment 54 and/or the second segments 56 of
the wire 33 by introducing a screw threaded profile with a second wire along the length of the wire 33 by
following a screw flights of various shapes such as a square, or a rhomboid, or a trapezoid, or a parallelogram,
or an ellipse, or a triangle, or a pentagon.
[00521     FIG. 10 shows an embodiment having a first segment 56 with a sleeve 70 having a roughened outer
surface using one of various methods mentioned earlier. In addition to showing a roughened surface
treatment, FIG. 10 further illustrates a wire with a weight added at the distal tip, in this case the weight is
added by a sleeve with a roughed outer surface. The weight may be centered on the wire or eccentrically
positioned. An eccentric weight may cause the wire to flail about during rotation. The flailing may perturb
the vessels more aggressively compared to a wire with centrically added weight.
[00531     The distal end 52 of the wire 33 may also include a curved segment. The curvature of the curved
segment may be constant, or it may follow other curves, such as a sector of an ellipse or an oval. The distal
end 52 of the wire 33 may also have a straight segment distal to the curved segment. Similar to the
embodiments with a constant curvature, the curvature of the curved section with a straight segment may be
