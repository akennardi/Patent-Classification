            "Modular cassettes, panels and kits for constructing residential structures"
Technical Field
[0001]       The described embodiments relate generally to prefabricated components and kits using
modular structures for residential structures and methods of their use or assembly. Particular
embodiments relate to modular cassettes and panels suitable for use as various structural elements
of at least part of a residential structure.
Background
[0002]       Construction of residential buildings is a complex process requiring the coordination
and management of various materials, equipment, activities, and personnel. Along with potential
safety issues, this can be time-consuming and/or expensive.
[0003]       Specialist heavy equipment, such as large cranes, is often required for the construction
process. Due to cost, such equipment is hired and therefore may not always be available. Access to
site can be an inconvenience particularly in residential areas. It is desirable to minimise the amount
of hire time.
[0004]       Coordination and management of the construction process is a significant contributor to
the time and cost of the project. Specialist tradespeople need to be on site at the correct time to
synchronise their work activities with other specialist tradespeople on other aspects of the project.
[0005]       The timing and progress of certain work activities may also be affected by adverse
weather events.
[0006]       The use of varying room sizes and arrangements requires custom structural elements for
each area of the building, which adds complexity to the project.
[0007]       Obtaining permits and certification of built structures can be a time-consuming and/or
expensive process, particularly if designs vary across projects.
[0008]       Throughout this specification the word "comprise", or variations such as "comprises" or
"comprising", will be understood to imply the inclusion of a stated element, integer or step, or
                                                   1

group of elements, integers or steps, but not the exclusion of any other element, integer or step, or
group of elements, integers or steps.
[0009]       Any discussion of documents, acts, materials, devices, articles or the like which has
been included in the present specification is not to be taken as an admission that any or all of these
matters form part of the prior art base or were common general knowledge in the field relevant to
the present disclosure as it existed before the priority date of each claim of this application.

Detailed Description
[0054]        The described prefabricated modules function as part of a package comprising cassettes,
panels, and support structure which can be used to form at least part of a residential structure, for
example. When used together with support structures, the described cassettes and panels can extend
across a large area, horizontally as well as vertically. This system enables a modular approach to
design and construction of a residential structure which can reduce overall design and construction
time and cost.
[0055]        The prefabricated cassette and panel modules reduce the time on site required of
specialist tradespersons and equipment hire.
[0056]        The described cassettes and panels are fabricated and assembled off-site in a controlled
environment from materials described herein. Standardisation of parts means fabrication and
assembly can be performed in a timely manner, and the individual cassettes and panel modules
provide for a lighter and more easily transportable form than prefabricated residential structures of
the prior art.
[0057]        Formation of the cassettes and panels with components made from standard materials
and sections available in the industry permits the replacement of individual components.
                                                     7

[0058]       Bathroom and/or kitchen units may be supplied as prefabricated "pod" units which
interface directly with the cassette and panel modules, and support structure.
[0059]       The described cassettes and panels are or can include modules of several pre-determined
sizes, for example to suit various load requirements in accordance with the applicable international
and Australian Standards, and building codes. Cassettes denote floor and roof embodiments, while
panels denote wall embodiments. Modules denote the general concept of prefabricated cassettes and
panels.
[0060]       The described cassettes and panels are formed by fixedly coupling various constituent
parts together to create a lightweight body with stiffness and rigidity in the desired loading planes.
FLOOR CASSETTES
[0061]       Referring now to Figures 1A and IB, a floor cassette 100 according to some
embodiments will now be described in further detail. Floor cassette 100 comprises a first end 101
with first end face 104, an opposite second end 101a with second end face 104a, a first side 102
with first side face 104b, an opposite second side 102a with second side face 104c, a first major face
103, and a second major face 103a. The first end face 104 is parallel to the second end face 104a,
and the first side face 104b is parallel to the second side face 104c. The end faces 104 and 104a are
perpendicular to the side faces 104b and 104c. Collectively, the faces 104, 104a, 104b, and 104c
may also be referred to as "minor faces". The minor faces 104, 104a, 104b, and 104c may be
contoured to facilitate positioning adjacent to the corresponding minor faces of another cassette 100
or with the support structure main beams 120a. The first major face 103 has a level surface which
provides an extended uniform surface when two cassettes 100 are positioned adjacently. The second
major face 103a is on the opposite side to the first major face, and in conjunction with the stiffening
members 121, defines a plurality of surface variations on the inverse of cassette 100. The exposed
surfaces of the stiffening members 103b are parallel to 103a. There may also be a plurality of
mounting formations on the major and minor faces to facilitate mounting of the cassette 100 to the
supporting structure main beams 120a.
[0062]       A frame 120 is created by fixedly coupling various stiffening members 121. These
members 121 span the length and width of cassette 100 at a designated spacing. One embodiment of
120 is illustrated in Figure IB, where there are four equally-spaced stiffening members along the
                                                    8

length (121a) of cassette 100, and a further two stiffening members along the width (121b),
although the number and spacing of stiffening members 121a and 121b may vary across different
embodiments. The designated spacing is intended to reduce the loaded span of the board 110 and
provide rigidity to the overall structure of the cassette 100 or panel 150.
 [0063]       For floor cassettes 100, stiffening members 121 are or comprise elongate sections,
typically comprising "Boxspan" B20020 steel sections with a cross section measuring 200mm x
50mm and section wall thickness 2mm, or steel sections such as the "Hopley HJ 200" open web
joist section, although these are examples only and are not intended to be limiting. In other known
embodiments, for example panel 150, stiffening members 121 can be 75mm deep steel studs (133).
The use of steel does not preclude stiffening members 121 being made from alternative materials
comprising timber, aluminium, or plastic, such as a polyolefin material, for example. In some
embodiments, the cross-sectional size and shape of the stiffening members may vary, to suit the
load and span requirements. The lengths of stiffening members 121 are to be sized to achieve the
required overall cassette or panel dimensions, and fixedly coupled by means of removable
connectors, such as brackets and "Tek" screws provided by the supplier, although this is intended to
be illustrative and not restrictive.
 [0064]       A board 110 is fixedly coupled to the frame 120 as shown in Figures 1A and lB. The
combination of board 110 and frame 120 defines a series of recesses and cavities 105 in between
the stiffening members 121. These recesses and cavities 105 may be used to accommodate
secondary features such as insulation 132, wiring harness 130, and other services 131. Typical
wiring 130 may include electrical and data cabling. Typical services 131 may include water, gas,
and sewage piping. Removable connectors such as nuts and bolts may be used to attach the board
 110 to the frame 120, and the secondary features to the board or frame. Different connectors may be
used in different embodiments and their specification is intended to be illustrative and not
restrictive.
 [0065]       As illustrated in Figure 2, individual floor cassettes 100 have a typical length of about
3600mm, a typical width of about 1800mm, and a typical depth of about 220mm, although some
small variation to these dimensions may occur during manufacturing and assembly. Example
dimensions given in the Figures are expressed generally in millimetres for distances or degrees for
angles. These dimensions may vary in different embodiments and are intended to be illustrative, not
restrictive.
                                                     9

SUPPORT STRUCTURE
[0066]        Figure 3 shows the main members 120a of the support structure. These are elongate
sections, typically comprising steel rectangular hollow section (RHS) with cross section measuring
200mm x 100mm and have a section wall thickness of 4mm. These act as main structural beams for
the roof and floor. The beam size and shape used for the floor may not be the same size and shape
used for the roof. In some embodiments, the cross-sectional size and shape of the main members
120a may vary, to suit the load and span requirements. For example, steel "I" or "H" beams may be
used for the roof or floor. In other embodiments, the main structural beams may comprise
alternative materials to steel, for example timber, aluminium, or plastic such as a polyolefin
material. Members 120a are available in different configurations depending on the number of
cassettes to be supported (Figure 11 A and 1 IB). Members 120a are positioned adjacent and parallel
with end faces 104 and 104a of cassette 100.
[0067]        With reference to Figures 7, 9, 10, and 13, member 120b is positioned adjacent and
parallel to side faces 104b and 104c of cassette 100. Member 120b may be or comprise an elongate
folded steel section of cross section about 200mm deep and about 25mm wide, for example, or of
similar dimensions, such that adequate support and connection for the wall panel 150 is provided. In
some embodiments, the material and the cross-sectional size and shape of member 120b may vary
to suit the load and span requirements.
FOOTING SYSTEM
[0068]        Figure 4 is a perspective view of the layout of the footing system 106 with indicative
dimensions. The footing systems used may be or comprise a third-party proprietary product, for
example the "Mega Anchor Footing" or "Sure Foot" system, installed at 3700mm centres directly
beneath columns 114.However, footing installation at other locations may be necessary depending
on site requirements, and so 3700mm centres may not be used in some embodiments.
[0069]        Separate bathroom and kitchen "Pod" modules may be fitted to add user amenity. Pods
for bathrooms (107) and kitchens (108) are assembled on a standard floor cassette at an off-site
factory, together with all required fixtures and fittings, finishes and sealing, electric and water
services and similar. The pods are fully finished ready for installation on-site and connected by
plugs through standard off-the-shelf plug and play assemblies. Example systems are electric
                                                   10

systems by CMS Electron, hot and cold water systems by Sharkbite, and drainage systems by
Geberit.
[0070]       Figure 5 is a perspective view of the positioning of the cassettes 100 in relation to the
support structure members 120a and support structure columns 114. Figures 12A, 12B, 13 to 15 are
section views of the floor cassette 100 in position with support structure. The board 110 is
nominally an inert material, such as magnesium oxide board, for example. Other board materials
may be used in other embodiments, and the use of magnesium oxide board does not preclude use of
alternative board materials. In some embodiments, the board 110 may comprise a composite
material or composite structure, such as sandwich panels comprising metal or plastic or timber
layers combined with layers of other metal, plastic and/or wood materials. The thickness of board
110 is nominally about 20mm, although this may vary across other embodiments, may vary
depending on the board material used, and is intended to be illustrative, not restrictive. The cassettes
and panels are attached to columns 114 and main beams 120a by means of a bracket 115 and a nut
and bolt arrangement 116. Similar forms of connection to 115 may include, but are not limited to,
cleats 1 15a, top hats 1 15b, and plates 1 15c.
WALL PANELS
[0071]       Figures 6A, 6B, and 6C show a further modular cassette or panel embodiment 150.
Embodiment 150 is typically used as a divider or wall, and is henceforth referred to as a panel. As
both major sides of panel 150 are visible and accessible, an additional board 110 is placed on the
exposed faces of the stiffening members (103b) for cosmetic, safety, and functional purposes. This
sandwiches the frame 120 between two boards 110. The internal cavity of panels 150 may contain
insulation 132 and modularised connectable electrical cables 130. Inserts or cut outs, as illustrated
in Figures 6B and 7, may be formed in boards 110 to accommodate windows and doors and their
ancillary components.
[0072]       Referring further to Figures 6A, 6B, and 6C, a wall panel 150 according to some
embodiments is described in further detail. Wall panel 150 comprises a first end 151 with first end
face 151a, an opposite second end 152 with second end face 152a, a first side 153 with first side
face 153a, an opposite second side 154 with second side face 154a, a first major face 155, and a
second major face 156. The first end face 151a is parallel to the second end face 152a, and the first
side face 153a is parallel to the second side face 154a. The end faces 151a and 152a are
perpendicular to the side faces 153a and 154a. Collectively, the faces 151a, 152a, 153a, and 154a
                                                  11

may also be referred to as "minor faces". The minor faces may be contoured to facilitate positioning
adjacent to the corresponding minor faces of another wall panel 150, the supporting structure main
beams 120a, or the support structure 114. The first major face 155 is a level surface which provides
an extended uniform surface when two panels 150 are positioned adjacently. The second major face
156 is on the opposite side to the first major face and is similar to 155 in providing an extended
uniform surface. There may also be a plurality of mounting formations on the major and minor
faces to facilitate mounting of the panel to the supporting structure main beams 120a, or the support
structure columns 114, using connections 115, 115a, 115b, and/or 115c as illustrated in Figures 12
to 17. Wall panels 150 have a width 1200mm and depth 90mm, although this may vary in different
embodiments. The height of the panel may be 2400mm or 2700mm depending on the floor-to
ceiling height desired. In some embodiments, the height of the panel may be between 2000mm and
4000mm.
[0073]       With reference to Figures 7 and 17, multiple wall panels 150 may be positioned end-to
end in a line along members of the support structure. Adjacent wall panels are butted, and the joints
sealed externally and internally to form an air gap with a pre-compressed impregnated resin joint
sealing tape 117. The sealing tape expands into the joint to fully seal the joint but enables ease of
removal for alterations or additions. A suitable sealing tape product is Tremco Illmod 600, for
example.
[0074]       Figure 16 is a section of the wall panel 150 and shows the construction of the panel and
connection of the panel to vertical support structure 114, which may include vertical members, such
as columns or stanchions. The frame 120 of panel 150 is a standard steel frame of similar form,
manufacture, function, and configuration to the frame used for cassette 100. However, in the
instance of panel 150, steel studs (133) measuring 75mm in width are used for the stiffening
members 121. In some embodiments, stiffening members 121 may comprise an elongate section of
varying size and material to satisfy loading requirements. Stiffening members 121 may be oriented
along the length and width of the panel as per configuration for cassette 100. There may also be
stiffening members located inboard, however their exact number and configuration may not be
identical to that used in cassette 100. The panel is fixed to support structure 114 via steel stud 133.
[0075]       With reference to Figure 16, the vertical members of the support structure 114 comprise
node points which may include a steel square hollow section (SHS) column with cross section
measuring 100mm x 100mm, and height 2400mm or 2700mm to correspond with wall panel 150.
Section wall thickness of the column is nominally 2mm, although the thickness may vary depending
                                                    12

on whether a second storey is supported. These columns transfer loads into the footing system 102.
Support structure 114 attaches to main beams 120a by means of a cleat arrangement 115a. In some
embodiments, the node points may comprise alternative materials and dimensions to satisfy loading
requirements.
ROOF CASSETTES
[0076]        Figures 8, 18, and 19 show alternative cassette embodiment 140. Cassette 140 is formed
using cassette 100 as a starting point. Secondary structure in the form of graded battens and/or
purlins 122 are positioned on the exposed faces of the stiffening members (103b), and are oriented
parallel to stiffening members 121b. Roof sheeting 123 is subsequently fixedly coupled to the
battens and purlins. Further additional secondary structure includes gutters 134, fascia 135, flashing
136, ceiling lining 137, and the siphonic drainage system 138. Cassette 140 is based on cassette 100
and therefore both cassettes are identical in form, manufacture, and configuration prior to the
addition of any secondary structures.
[0077]        Gutter 134 as shown in Figure 18 may typically be a box section with a cross section
measuring 200mm x 150mm, fabricated from PVC "grey grade" to minimise the effects of thermal
expansion/contraction and UV damage. It may also be possible to use steel, aluminium, or another
plastic as an alternative material.
[0078]        Figure 18 is a section view showing a typical arrangement of the roof sheeting 123,
gutter 134, fascia 135, flashing 136, ceiling lining 137, and siphonic drainage system 138 relative to
the roof cassette 140, support structure members 121a, and wall panel 150. Typical connection
details for the roof cassette 140, support structure members 121a, and wall panel 150 are illustrated
in Figures 12A and 12B, and feature connections by means of brackets 115 and a nut and bolt
arrangement 116. Dimensions indicated are intended to be illustrative, not restrictive.
[0079]        Figure 9 is a perspective view of the assembled residential structure with floor cassettes
100, wall panels 150, roof cassettes 140, and support structure members 120a and columns 114.
Figure 19A is a section view showing the positioning of graded battens and/or purlins 122 to which
the roof sheeting 123 is attached. Typical purlin sections are "z purlins", although this is intended to
be illustrative, not restrictive. Figure 19B is another section view from an alternative angle.
