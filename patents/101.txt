CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS
[0001] This application claims the benefit of and priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application
No. 62/514,089 filed June 2, 2017, U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 62/451,936 filed
January 30, 2017, U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 62/442,6 10 filed January 5, 2017,
and U.S. Patent Application No. 15/835,853 filed 8 December 2017, the entire disclosures of
which are incorporated by reference herein.
BACKGROUND
1.      Technical Field
[0002] The present disclosure relates to surgical implants, staples, clips or fasteners and, more
particularly, to implantable fasteners including low dose brachytherapy capsules, and fastener
applicators therefor.
2.      Background ofRelated Art
[0003] Generally, brachytherapy is an advanced form of cancer treatment. Specifically,
radioactive seeds (alone or incorporated within sutures, buttresses or the like) are placed in or
near the cancer site itself, where they emit a relatively low dose of radiation directly to the
cancer site while reducing exposure of surrounding healthy tissue to the radiation.
[0004] Depending on the underlying cancer to be treated and on the underlying tissue, particular
dosimetry guidelines have been developed for the placement of radioactive seeds and for the
radiation levels emitted by the radioactive seeds. Generally, the radioactive seeds are placed at
predefined distances relative to one another in order to enable effective dosimetry.
[0005] Accordingly, improved structures incorporating radioactive seeds and methods of
placing those structures at or near cancer sites may be advantageous.

                                                  2

[0013] In some embodiments, radioactive material is dispersed throughout at least one of the
implantable fasteners such that the entirety of at least one of the implantable fasteners emits
radiation.
[0014] In embodiments, the implantable fasteners includes a first implantable fastener having
sufficient mechanical strength to hold tissue together, and a second implantable fastener having
the capsule affixed thereon for providing the dose of radiation to the target surgical site.
[0015] In certain embodiments, each of the first leg and the second leg of the surgical staple
includes a first portion and a second portion, the first portion of the first leg and the first portion
of the second leg extending away from the backspan at an angle such that the first portions of
the first leg and the second leg overlap, the second portions of the first leg and the second leg
extending from the first portions of each of the first leg and the second leg, respectively, towards
the backspan.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS
[0040] Embodiments of the presently disclosed implantable fasteners and fastener applicators
will now be described in detail with reference to the drawings, in which like reference numerals
designate identical or corresponding elements in each of the several views. In the drawings and
in the description that follows, the term "proximal" will refer to the end of the implantable
fasteners and fastener applicator which are closest to the operator, while the term "distal" will
refer to the end of the implantable fasteners and fastener applicator which are farthest from the
operator.
[0041] In accordance with the present disclosure, as illustrated in FIGS. 1A-IC, an embodiment
of an implantable fastener 100 is provided and generally includes a body 102 and a tissue
penetrating portion 104 extending from the body 102. The body 102 includes a crown or
backspan 106 and the tissue penetrating portion 104 includes a first leg 108 extending from a
first end portion 106a of the backspan 106 and a second leg 110 extending from a second end
portion 106b of the backspan 106. The first leg 108 and the second leg 110 may extend in a
same direction such as, for example, distally from the backspan 106.
[0042] The backspan 106 includes a top or tissue facing surface 106c configured for fixedly
supporting a capsule 112 thereon. It is envisioned that capsule 112 includes a radiation source,
as will be detailed below. The capsule 112 is affixed to the tissue facing surface 106c of the
backspan 106 using laser welding or other suitable methods. In some embodiments, as
illustrated in FIG. IC, the tissue facing surface 106 may include a flattened surface 106d
extending along at least a portion thereof and configured to provide an increased surface area for
affixing the capsule 112 thereon. In embodiments, the capsule 112 may be affixed to a portion
of the backspan 106, such as, for example, the flattened surface 106d of the tissue facing surface
106, using a snap-fit engagement. The backspan 106 may then be heated or crimped to reduce
the probability of the dislocation and migration of capsule 112 from implantable fastener 100. It
is contemplated that affixing the capsule 112 on the tissue facing surface 106c of the backspan

                                                   7
106 may be advantageous since it enables the capsule 112 to be in direct contact with a target
surgical site, such as, for example, tissue or the like (see FIG. 10). For example, it is
contemplated that direct contact between capsule 112 and the target surgical site may provide a
controlled, homogeneous dosing of radiation to the target surgical site, while avoiding
substantial dosing of normal surrounding structures. It is further contemplated that direct
contact between capsule 112 and the target surgical site may provide reduced attenuation of
dosing from the radiation source to the target surgical site. Alternatively, as shown in FIGS. 2A
and 2B, the capsule 112 may be affixed to a bottom surface 106e or a lateral surface 106f of the
backspan 106. Though not specifically shown in the figures, it is contemplated that the first leg
108, the second leg 110 may be affixed directly onto the capsule 112 using laser welding,
crimping, or other suitable methods.
[0043] Implantable fastener 100 may have an unformed condition, as shown in FIG. 1A,
wherein the first leg 108 and the second leg 110 are parallel, or substantially parallel, to one
another and spaced a relative distance from one another. Implantable fastener 100 may have a
formed condition, as shown in FIG. IB, wherein the first leg 108 and the second leg 110 are
radiused and in relative close approximation to one another and backspan 106.
[0044] Implantable fastener 100 may be fabricated from a formable material, such as, for
example, titanium, stainless steel or polymers. In this manner, implantable fastener 100 may be
introduced over a target vessel or tissue while in an unformed condition, and then formed or
fastened onto the target vessel or tissue to secure the implantable fastener 100 to the target
vessel or tissue. It is contemplated that implantable fasteners 100 may be fabricated from any
non-degradable, biocompatible material known by those having skill in the art. It is further
contemplated that the implantable fasteners 100, or any parts thereof, may be formed from a
degradable material such as magnesium.
[0045] In accordance with the present disclosure, as illustrated in FIGS. 1A-2B, and noted
above, implantable fastener 100 may include the capsule 112 having a radiation source. Capsule
112 may be a brachytherapy capsule or seed and include a radioactive material 1 12a disposed
therein. The radioactive material 112a may include any of a number of radioactive isotopes.
Possible low dose isotopes include, but are not limited to, Cesium-131 (      Cs), Iridium-192
(192 Ir), Iodine-125 (125I), Palladium-103 (  Pd), and Ytterbium-169 ( 169Yb). Therapeutic
dosages may range from 80 to 150 Gy depending on the isotope and desired exposure.

                                                   8
Implantable fastener 100 may have various target energies to provide flexibility in planning the
treatment. It is envisioned that a particular strength of the radiation field and/or a particular
geometry of the radiation field may be a function of the radioactive material 112a. It is further
envisioned that capsule 112 may be dimensioned so as to determine the geometry of the emitted
radiation or the strength of the emitted radiation. It is contemplated that a length of capsule 112
may be less than a length of backspan 106 so as to not interfere with the formation of
implantable fastener 100.
[0046] Though not specifically shown in the figures, it is contemplated that the first leg 108, the
second leg 110, and/or backspan 106 may include one or more cavities for receiving capsules
112 or radioactive material 112a. Any other combinations of placement of capsule 112, as well
as integration of capsule 112 in implantable fastener 100 is also contemplated and within the
scope of the present disclosure.
[0047] It is further envisioned, that implantable fastener 100 may be processed such that the
entirety of implantable fastener 100 emits radiation from radioactive material 112a dispersed
throughout implantable fastener 100. For example, and within the purview of the present
disclosure, implantable fastener 100 may be processed so as to determine the strength of the
emitted radiation. Specifically, in an embodiment, implantable fastener 100 may be a polymeric
surgical clip fabricated from a radioactive biocompatible material.
[0048] It is contemplated that implantable fasteners 100 having radioactive material 112a
disposed therein may be locatable using imaging techniques, such as, for example, X-ray or the
like. In embodiments where implantable fasteners 100 do not include radioactive material 112a,
implantable fasteners 100 may be coated with a material, such as, for example, gold, or coated
with a colored oxide layer to make implantable fasteners 100 relatively more visible. Gold
coatings or other coatings may be utilized to enable radiographic location of implantable
fasteners 100 during follow-up procedures. In this manner, implantable fasteners 100 may serve
as fiduciary markers.
[0049] In accordance with the present disclosure, by fastening the implantable fastener 100 onto
a target vessel or tissue, a therapeutic dose of radiation can be applied to a set location and
known volume of tissue based on the activity and isotope material of the capsule 112.

                                                    9
[0050] In embodiments, implantable fasteners 100 including the capsule 112 serve the purpose
of applying a local therapeutic dose of radiation to, for example, a tumor or to a resection site
after removal of a cancerous tumor. As such, those implantable fasteners 100 that include the
capsule 112 only require sufficient mechanical strength to secure the capsule 112 in place and
may not be intended to hold tissue together. However, the plurality of implantable fasteners 100
may include one or more implantable fasteners 100 that are designed with sufficient mechanical
strength to hold tissue together. Alternatively, implantable fasteners 100 including the capsule
112 may be designed with sufficient mechanical strength to hold tissue together while also
securing the capsule 112 in place.
[0051] Implantable fasteners 100 may be applied or fastened to any number of tissues having a
tumorous growth or suspected of including cancer cells, such as, for example lung tissue, solid
organs, gastro-intestinal tissue, and soft tissues.
[0052] In accordance with the present disclosure, it is envisioned that implantable fasteners 100
may be applied separately, and individually, at a predetermined location by a clinician. It is
contemplated that capsule 112 has a set three-dimensional field of known radiation strength and
geometry, as such, multiple implantable fasteners 100 including capsule 112 may be applied to
the target tissue to provide a controlled, homogeneous dosing of the radiation source to the
target surgical site.
[0053] It is contemplated that implantable fasteners 100 may be applied or arranged in any
configuration, pattern, or quantity to achieve the intended purpose. For example, implantable
fasteners 100 may be arranged in, for example, a straight line, arcuate, triangular, rectangular,
circular or other configuration. It is further contemplated that implantable fasteners 100 may be
fastened to the target tissue a uniform distance from one another, to achieve the desired
dosimetry. Alternatively, implantable fasteners 100 may be fastened to the target tissue at
various distances from one another, or a combination thereof.
[0054] In accordance with the present disclosure, while an implantable fastener in the form of
implantable fastener 100 has been shown and described in detail, it is contemplated that the
implantable fastener may include, and is not limited to, a surgical staple, a surgical coil or the
like. As mentioned above, and as contemplated herein, any of the implantable fasteners may be
fabricated from a biocompatible material, such as, for example, titanium, stainless steel or

                                                10
polymers. Likewise, as mentioned above, and as contemplated herein, any of the implantable
fasteners may incorporate therein or support thereon a capsule 112 having radioactive material
112a, or may be processed such that the entirety of the implantable fastener emits radiation.
[0055] For example, with reference to FIGS. 3A and 3B, an implantable fastener in the form of
a "B-shaped" surgical staple is shown and generally designated as 200. Similar to implantable
fastener 100, implantable fastener 200 may generally include a body 202 and a tissue
penetrating portion 204 extending from the body 202. The body 202 includes a crown or
backspan 206 and the tissue penetrating portion 204 includes a first leg 208 extending from a
first end portion 206a of the backspan 206 and a second leg 210 extending from a second end
portion 206b of the backspan 206.
[0056] In accordance with the present disclosure, at least one capsule 212, similar to capsule
112, may be affixed to a tissue facing surface 206c of backspan 206. Capsule 212 may include a
radioactive material 212a. Additionally or alternatively, it is further envisioned that implantable
fastener 200 may be processed such that the entirety of implantable fastener 200 emits radiation
from radioactive material dispersed throughout implantable fastener 200. For example,
implantable fastener 200 may be processed so as to determine the strength of the emitted
radiation.
[0057] Implantable fastener 200 may have an unformed condition, as shown in FIG. 3A,
wherein the first leg 208 and the second leg 210 are parallel, or substantially parallel, to one
another and spaced a relative distance from one another. Implantable fastener 200 may have a
formed condition, as shown in FIG. 3B, wherein at least a portion of the first leg 208 and the
second leg 210 are radiused and in relative close approximation to one another and backspan
206 to define a substantially B-shaped structure.
[0058] Implantable fastener 200 may be fabricated from, for example, titanium, stainless steel or
polymers. In an embodiment, implantable fastener 200 may be a polymeric surgical pin
fabricated from a radioactive biocompatible material. Some examples of non-degradable
biocompatible polymers include polyolefins such as polyethylenes and polypropylenes, nylons,
polyesters, silicones, polyimides, polymethylmethacrylates, polyphthalamides, polyurethanes,
PTFE, polyethersulfone, polysulfone, PEEK, to name a few.

                                                   11
[0059] As an additional example, with reference to FIGS. 4A and 4B, an implantable fastener in
the form of a "W-shaped" surgical staple is shown and generally designated as 300. Similar to
implantable fasteners 100, 200, implantable fastener 300 may generally include a body 302 and
a tissue penetrating portion 304 extending from the body 302. The body 302 includes a crown
or backspan 306 and the tissue penetrating portion 304 includes a first leg 308 having a first
portion 308a and a second portion 308b, and a second leg 310 having a first portion 310a and a
second portion 310b. The first portion 308a of the first leg 308 extends from a first end portion
306a of backspan 306 and is coupled to a proximal end portion 309a of the second portion 308b
of the first leg 308. Similarly, the first portion 310a of the second leg 310 extends from a
second end portion 306b of backspan 306 and is coupled to a proximal end portion 311 a of the
second portion 3010b of the second leg 310.
[0060] In accordance with the present disclosure, at least one capsule 312, similar to capsules

reference. Fastener applicator 700 may be provided either pre-loaded with implantable fasteners
400, 800, or may be configured to selectively receive a cartridge assembly 720 loaded with
implantable fasteners 400, 800.
[0088] With reference to FIG. 16, in embodiments, the fastener applicator 700 (FIG. 15) may be
configured to selectively receive cartridge assembly 720' preloaded with a plurality of
implantable fasteners 900. Cartridge assembly 720' includes a plurality of ports 740 extending

                                                     18
through an outer surface thereof. Each port 740 is configured and dimensioned to longitudinally
align with the respective cannula 902c of body 902 of each implantable fastener 900 preloaded
into the cartridge assembly 720'. With the plurality of implantable fasteners 900 preloaded into
the cartridge assembly 720', the plurality of capsules 912 may be inserted through the plurality
of ports 740 and disposed within the respective cannulas 902c of the plurality of implantable
fasteners 900. This configuration facilitates efficient loading of the plurality of implantable
fasteners 900 with the plurality of capsules 912 without having to handle each implantable
fastener 900 individually. It is contemplated that this configuration may facilitate field
customization of the payload.
[0089] The fastener applicator 700 may be configured to fire or deliver implantable fasteners
400, 800, 900 during a full firing sequence. The fastener applicator 700 may also be configured
to articulate in order to facilitate the firing of implantable fasteners 400, 800, 900 therefrom.
[0090] In accordance with the present disclosure, the combination of implantable fasteners and
fastener applicators disclosed herein provides a clinician a relatively great deal of flexibility and
customization in placing radiation emitting implants, such as, for example, implantable fasteners
100, 200, 300, 400, 800, 900 at desired target surgical sites, whereby the fastener applicator,
such as, for example, fastener applicator 500 is articulatable and/or rotatable to provide the
clinician with increased flexibility and precision in placing the radiation emitting implants. It is
also contemplated that the fasteners could dispense other types of medical treatments such as
pharmaceutically active agents.
[0091] It is contemplated for example, that a geometry of implantable fasteners 100, 200, 300,
400, 800, 900; and a geometry of a fastener applicator 500, 600, 700 may be optimized to work
together as location guides to optimally place implantable fasteners 100, 200, 300, 400, 800, 900
adjacent to one another, wherein the capsules 112, 212, 316, 410, 410', 810, 912 has a known
geometry and radiation field strength, to achieve effective dosimetry.
[0092] In accordance with the present disclosure, the location of placement of implantable
fasteners 100, 200, 300, 400, 800, 900 is not limited to a predefined geometry, pattern, density,
or the like. In particular, as mentioned above, implantable fasteners 100, 200, 300, 400, 800,
900 may be fastened to a target tissue site in any geometry, pattern and/or density, as the
clinician desires or needs.

                                                   19
[0093] By way of example, the ability to fasten implantable fasteners 100, 200, 300, 400, 800,
900 to a target tissue site, such as, for example, lung tissue in a lung resection procedure, in any
geometry, pattern and/or density, may be quite useful in a lung cancer patient, where many lung
cancer patients suffer from impaired lung volume and cannot tolerate unnecessary loss of lung
volume, and may need multiple rows of brachytherapy sources to ensure treatment of an
inadequately narrow surgical margin.
[0094] In any of the embodiments disclosed herein, the implantable fasteners 100, 200, 300,
400, 800, 900 may be incorporated into, or configured for use with, devices that are part of a
powered surgical system or robotic surgical system.
[0095] It will be understood that various modifications may be made to the embodiments
disclosed herein. Therefore, the above description should not be construed as limiting, but
merely as exemplifications of preferred embodiments. Those skilled in the art will envision
other modifications within the scope and spirit of the disclosure herein.
