DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0073]      Figures 1 and 2 show two examples, generally indicated with reference
numerals 10.1 and 10.2, respectively, of part of a screening apparatus.
[0074]      In a number of embodiments, the screening apparatus 10 is used to process
particulate material received from a processing unit in the form of a primary crusher 14,
such that the screening apparatus 10 and the primary crusher 14 are in the form of a
system 11 for processing particulate material, as shown in figures 5 and 6.
[0075]      The primary crusher 14 feeds the particulate material onto a feed conveyor
16. The feed conveyor 16 is supported on load cells 17 to define a weigh-in-motion
device in the form of a belt weigher or weightometer 19 (figures 5 and 6). Thus, the load

                                               9
cells 17 are configured to generate a signal representing a feed rate to a controller or
computer, as is described in further detail below. It is to be appreciated that the weigh-in
motion device can take other forms, as may be known in the field. In a typical
application, such as in a quarry, the feed rate could be between about 300 tonnes per
hour to 250 tonnes per hour. It will this be appreciated that the weightometer 19 defines
an infeed sensing arrangement.
[0076]       The apparatus 10 includes a vibrating screen assembly 20, a shield member
or shield 40, such as a mat or belt, an adjustment mechanism 60 and a control
arrangement 70 (figures 5 and 6). The shield 40 is positioned on the screen assembly 20
so that energy generated by the screen assembly 20 is transferred into reciprocal
vibratory motion of the shield 40. This can then be imparted to particulate material
positioned on the shield 40 so that the material is displaced towards a discharge end of
the screen assembly 20.
[0077]       In other embodiments, the particulate material is fed directly onto the shield
40 rather than from a crusher.
[0078]       It is to be appreciated that an accessory for the screening apparatus is also
described herein. It is envisaged that the accessory would include the shield 40, the
adjustment mechanism 60 and the control arrangement 70 that could be retrofitted to an
existing vibrating screen assembly, which could be indicated with reference numeral 20.
Examples of the accessory are described below and with reference to figures 12 to 26.
[0079]       The examples 10.1 and 10.2 are provided as a way of indicating that some
form of generic means for displacing the shield 40 relative to the screen assembly 20
can be provided instead of the various embodiments described below. Thus, it is
envisaged that various alternatives to the embodiments described below may be
applicable. These could include manually retracting or extending the shield with some
form of winch arrangement and various other mechanisms that require direct operation
by a user or operator.
[0080]       For example, when the shield 40 is positioned on the screen assembly 20,
the vibration of the screen assembly 20 will tend to draw the shield 40 towards a
discharge end of the screen assembly 20. This can be a function of existing vibrating
screen assemblies that have rotary vibrators that impart a circular or ellipsoidal vibratory
motion or vibrational pattern to generally horizontal screen decks so that the particulate
matter or aggregate on the screen decks is displaced from the feed end to the discharge
end as it vibrates or bounces on the screen decks. It will be appreciated that, with the
shield 40 positioned on a screen deck to which such vibratory motion is imparted, the

                                               10
aggregate or particulate material on the shield 40 will also tend to move towards a
discharge end of the shield 40 if the shield 40 is restrained against such movement.
[0081]       The shield 40 can be drawn back towards a feed end of the screen assembly
20 with a suitable pulley or winch arrangement that engages the shield 40 and is
operable to draw the shield 40 back against the natural movement of the shield 40
towards the discharge end. It will be appreciated that any other suitable arrangement
can be used to draw the shield 40 back. While the deck is vibrating, retraction of the
shield 40 is possible with such an arrangement. However, should the deck stop
vibrating, the load on the deck and the shield 40 could be too high for the shield 40 to be
retracted with that arrangement. In such a case, a mechanical engagement mechanism,
such as a clamping arrangement, can be temporarily attached to the shield 40 and
connected to a winch to retract the shield 40 from the deck.
[0082]       The screen assembly 20 includes a deck 22, a screen 24 and a vibrating
mechanism in the form of a vibrator 26. The screen assembly 20 is also sometimes
known as a shaker. As is known, such vibrators include an offset weight that is rotated to
generate a vibrational pattern in the screen assembly. The configuration of the weight
and the manner in which it is offset provides a desired vibrational pattern.
[0083]       The deck 22 is supported above a substrate by legs 28. The deck 22 is
usually inclined. However, as intimated above, the deck 22 can also be generally
horizontal with the vibrational pattern imparting movement of the particulate material
towards the discharge end. The legs 28 allow movement of the deck 22 when the
vibrator 26 is energized.
[0084]       The deck 22 supports or includes the screen 24. The screen 24 has a feed
end 30 and a discharge end 32. A screen area 34 is defined as the area between the
feed end 30 and the discharge end 32. Aggregate or particulate material passing
through the screen area 34 is referred to as "screenings". Particulate material that does
not pass through the screen area 34 and passes over the discharge end 32 is referred to
as "discharge". It is to be noted that the particulate material can take many forms. These
could include shells of nuts, wood chips, and various other forms of particulate material.
The particulate material could also include a broad range of overall sizes, from relatively
fine granular material, such as powders, to larger aggregate material such as aggregate
mined at a quarry.
[0085]       Holes or apertures in the screen 24 may be of a uniform size throughout the
screen 24. In another embodiment, as shown in figure 1, the screen 24 may be divided
into zones 24.1 and 24.2. The zone 24.1 has holes or apertures which are uniform in

                                               II
size. The zone 24.2 has holes or apertures which are uniform in size. The holes in the
zone 24.1 are of a different size to the holes in the zone 24.2. In the embodiment shown
in figure 1, the holes in the zone 24.1 are smaller than the holes in the zone 24.2. In
another embodiment, the holes in the zone 24.1 are larger than the holes in the zone
24.2. In various embodiments, holes or apertures in a region at or near the discharge
end 32 are smaller than holes or apertures in a region further from the discharge end 32.
It will thus be appreciated that the particulate material can be fed to a particular zone
depending on the position of the shield 40.
[0086]        Only two zones 24.1 and 24.2 are shown, but it will be appreciated that the
screen 24 may have any number of zones with different sized holes. The screen 24 may
be made up of a number x of removable sections, with each section defining a zone
24.x.
[0087]          The shield 40 may be in the form of a mat or belt. At least part of the shield
40 is positioned on the screen 24 to cover part of the screen area 34.
[0088]        An area 36 within the screen area 34, which is not covered by the shield 40,
is hereinafter referred to as the "effective screen area". The effective screen area 36 is
varied by adjusting the position of the shield 40 relative to the discharge end 32.
[0089]        The shield 40 has a discharge end 42. The discharge end 42 is transverse
to the longitudinal extension of the screen 24 between the feed end 30 and the
discharge end 32 of the screen 24.
[0090]        Adjusting the position of the shield 40 includes moving the discharge end 42
along a line between the feed end 30 and the discharge end 32. The effective screen
area 36 is defined between the discharge end 42 of the shield 40 and the discharge end
32 of the screen 24. The closer the distal end 42 of the shield 40 is to the discharge end
32 of the screen 24, the smaller the effective screen area 36. The closer the discharge
end 42 of the shield 40 is to the feed end 30 of the screen 24, the larger the effective
screen area 36.
[0091]        In the example indicated by reference numeral 10.2 in figure 2, instead of a
single mat 40, two side-by-side mats 40.1, 40.2 are provided. These can be used to vary
the exposure of the aggregate or particulate material to the zones 24.1, 24.2 to achieve
a greater variation in product than would be the case with one mat 40. The inventor(s)
envisages that three or more such side-by-side mats could also be provided further to
vary the product.

                                               12
[0092]        In one example, the shield 40 is a length of flexible or resilient sheet material
that is fed from a roller 46 as shown in figure 7. The shield 40 may be a mat of
elastomeric material.
[0093]        An example of a suitable material for the shield 40 is that used for conveyor
belts. In this case, the shield 40 can have a thickness of between about 1 mm and 100
mm, depending on the application. It will be appreciated that such material can help to
impart the vibratory motion of the screen 24 to the particulate material. For example,
when the shield 40 is thinner, it can be used with particulate material having a smaller
aggregate size. Alternatively, when the shield 40 is thicker, it can be used with
particulate material having a larger aggregate size. For example, it is envisaged that the
shield 40, together with a screen assembly with appropriate characteristics, can be used
with material in a powdered form right up to material received from a rock crusher.
[0094]        In another embodiment, the shield 40 comprises sections 44 which fold
together as shown in figure 8. The sections 44 are articulated or hinged together. The
sections 44 can have a level of resilience to enhance the vibratory motion imparted to
the particulate material on the shield 40. The sections 44 can have the characteristics
described above with reference to the thickness.
[0095]        The shield 40 can dampen sound generated by the screen 24 as the
particulate material is processed.
[0096]        In many screening applications, the screen does not present a planar
surface. Rather, the screen can be bowed. Thus, the material of the shield 40 is selected
so that the shield 40 can conform to the shape of the screen when positioned on the
screen.
[0097]        In some applications, the screen may have components of fasteners
extending upwardly from the screen. In the event that these are of excessive length, they
can be shaved off with a suitable tool prior to making use of the apparatus 10. The
inventor(s) envisages that, in most cases, the shield can move to and fro over the
fasteners.
[0098]        The position of the shield 40 along the screen 22 is controlled by the
adjustment mechanism 60.
[0099]        The adjustment mechanism 60 includes roller assemblies having one or
more drive rollers 62. The drive rollers 62 engage opposite sides of the shield 40.
Alternatively, a drive roller can engage one side while an idler roller engages an opposite
side. The drive rollers 62 are driven with a suitable drive mechanism, such as a stepper

                                               13
motor 66 and a suitable transmission mechanism to adjust a position of the shield 40
between that shown in figure 3 and that shown in figure 4, for example, as indicated by
an arrow 63. Instead of the stepper motor 66, the drive mechanism can include a
hydraulic motor and gearbox assembly. The hydraulic motor and gearbox assembly is a
preferred option in those cases in which the apparatus 10 is used with crushed rock and
similar aggregate. In the example shown in figures 5 and 6, the drive rollers 62 can be
driven by a belt or chain indicated at 63 connected to an output of the drive mechanism
66.
[0100]        A scraping member or scraper 68 is positioned downstream of the drive
rollers 62 to engage the shield 40 (figures 7, 8). In operation, the scraper 68 serves to
scrape or remove material from the shield 40 so that the material does not interfere with
the operation of the drive rollers 62. A further scraper 69 is positioned upstream of the
drive rollers 62 to engage the shield 40. In operation, the scraper 69 also serves to
scrape or remove material from the shield 40. It will be appreciated that other
arrangements can be used for cleaning the shield 40, during operation, to protect the
drive rollers 62.
[0101]        The control arrangement 70 includes a control mechanism 71 that is
operatively connected to the adjustment mechanism 60 to control the position of the
shield 40. The control arrangement 70 includes the weightometer 19 that is connected to
the control mechanism 71. The control mechanism 71 includes a controller in the form of
a data processing apparatus, device or computer 74. The data processing device can
also be in the form of, or include, a programmed logic controller (PLC), as described
below with reference to figure 27.
[0102]        The control mechanism 71 includes a sensor or infeed sensing arrangement
in the form of a camera 72 that is configured to generate a video signal for transmission
to the computer 74. The computer 74 can be configured to process the video signal in
order to generate data relating to characteristics of the particulate material that is fed
onto the shield 40. The computer 74 is configured to control operation of the drive rollers
62, for example, in a manner that relates to the data received from the camera 72.
[0103]        The control arrangement 70 is configured to control an extent of adjustment
of the relative positions of the discharge ends 32, 42 of the, or each, shield and screen,
respectively.
[0104]        The embodiment of the control arrangement 70 shown in figure 6 includes a
second camera 78 that can define an outfeed sensing arrangement. The second
camera 78 is positioned and configured to transmit or stream a video signal representing

                                                14
the discharge received on a discharge conveyor 80. The computer 74 can be configured
to process the video signal from the second camera 78 to generate data relating to
characteristics of the discharge. The computer 74 is configured to control operation of
the drive rollers 62, for example, in a manner that relates to the data received from the
cameras 72, 78.
[0105]       The control arrangement 70 also includes a pair of load cells 82 on which the
conveyor 80 is mounted. Thus, the conveyor 80 can include a weightometer 83. The
weightometer 83 is connected to the computer 74 to provide a signal to the computer 74
representing a feed rate across the conveyor 80. It will be appreciated that a difference
between values generated by the weightometer 19 and the weightometer 83 can be
used to provide an indication of the rate at which material passes through the effective
area 36. Thus, the weightometer 83 defines an outfeed sensing arrangement.
[0106]       The discharge conveyor 80 can be positioned upstream of a further
processing unit, for example a secondary crusher 18, so that the discharge can be fed to
the secondary crusher 18 for further processing, for example, crushing.
[0107]        In other embodiments, the control arrangement 70 can include a third
camera that is positioned and configured to transmit or stream a video signal
representing the screenings passing through the effective area 36.
[0108]        It is envisaged that the cameras or other devices such as x-ray devices could
replace the weightometers 19, 83. Thus, the other cameras or devices referenced by 72,
78, could form part of an imaging system of a particle distribution analyser(s) capable of
generating a signal that represents a value relating to a particle size distribution of the
particulate material.
[0109]        It may be counter-intuitive to block part of a screen, because it is generally
considered desirable that as much screen area be used as possible. However, the shield
40 can serve useful purposes, as is set out below.
[0110]        It will be appreciated that the longer a layer of particulate material is exposed
to a vibrating screen, the more screen-sized particulate material will pass through the
screen as the screenings and less will pass over the screen as the discharge. It follows
that, for a given rate of feed over a known area of screen, a size distribution can be
estimated. Thus, it is possible to alter the size distribution of the discharge and
screenings by altering the effective area 36 by adjusting the position of the shield 40.
[0111]       Thus, it is possible to achieve a smaller size distribution by reducing the
effective area 36 or a larger size distribution by increasing the effective area 36.

                                                15
[0112]        For the purposes of this description, we can assume the following
parameters:
             a. A = effective screen area (as shown by the effective area 36)
             b. S = screen size
             c. R = feed rate (generated by the weightometer 19)
             d. D, = screenings distribution size (average aggregate size in screenings)
             e. D = discharge distribution size (average aggregate size in discharge)
[0113]        This means that two functions can be obtained. The first being Ds = f(A,S,R)
and the second being Dd = f(A,S,R). For the purposes of clarity, we will take S as a
constant. This means that Ds = f(A,R) and       Dd = f(A,R). It will, however, be appreciated
that further variation can be achieved by using the different zones 24.1 and 24.2. Still
further variation can be achieved by using the two shields 40.1 and 40.2 together with
the two zones 24.1 and 24.2, as shown in figure 2. The inventor(s) envisages that any
number of shields and zones can be provided to achieve variations in product, as
required.
[0114]        More particularly, for a given feed rate R, an increase in A results in an
increase in D, or a lower proportion of fines in the screenings and an increase in Dd, or
a higher proportion of oversized particulate material in the discharge. A decrease in A
results in a decrease in Ds, or a higher proportion of fines in the screenings and a
decrease in Dd, or a lower proportion of oversized particulate material in the discharge.
[0115]        To obtain a level of usefulness out of this characteristic, a number of runs of
the screening apparatus 10 can be carried out together with static measurements so that
a general measurement of both D, and D, can be obtained for various positions of the
shield 40, which are directly proportional to A, and various values of R. These values
can be used to program the computer 74 to control operation of the adjustment
mechanism 60. For example, these values can be used to generate a function with
which the computer 74 can be programmed. In other words, a library of product
characteristics and their associations with the parameters described above can be
generated for future use, either automatically, by the computer 74 or by an operator
simply adjusting the shield with reference to a printout or a screen reading.
[0116]        After set up, the computer 74 can be configured to receive a signal
generated by the weightometer 19 and can be programmed with the function which
contains the parameters A and R, as mentioned above. Thus, the computer 74 can be

                                               16
used to execute both the functions mentioned above to control, at least to some extent,
D, and   Dd.
[0117]       The camera 72 can be used instead of the weightometer 19 to provide a
signal to the computer 74 that carries data relating to the particulate material fed onto to
the shield 40. At the same time, the camera 78 can provide a signal to the computer 74
that carries data relating to the discharge. This data, together with the data relating to
the particulate material fed onto the shield 40, can be used dynamically to adjust the
parameter A. This could be done with a feedback loop containing suitable buffers.
[0118]       It is to be appreciated that the screening apparatus 10 finds use as a
processing unit within a larger crushing and screening arrangement. The screen
assembly 20 can be used, as part of the apparatus 10, to achieve required screenings
distribution sizes and discharge distribution sizes.
[0119]       For example, in some cases, it would be desirable to achieve screenings
with a relatively higher proportion of fines as opposed to pebbles. In that case, it would
not be necessary to replace the screen 24 with a different screen having a different
screen size. Such a process can be laborious and time-consuming. Rather, the position
of the shield 40 can simply be adjusted to reduce the effective area 36. As set out
above, this will result in a smaller value of Ds and a larger value of Dd, with the discharge
being fed to a further processing unit such as another screen or a secondary crusher.
[0120]       In other cases, it might be desirable to achieve screenings with the same
amount of fines but with a higher amount of pebbles. Again, in that case, it would not be
necessary to replace the screen 24 with a different screen having a different screen size.
Rather, the position of the shield 40 can simply be adjusted to increase the effective
area. As set out above, this will result in a larger value of Ds and a smaller value of Dd,
also with the discharge being led to a further processing unit such as another screen or
a secondary crusher.
[0121]       As set out above, the shield 40 is positioned on the screen 24. As a result,
vibration of the screen 24 is imparted to the shield 40. Thus, the layer of particulate
material also vibrates. As a result, fines within the layer of particulate material tend to
migrate towards the shield 40 in a process that is called "granular convection". This is a
relatively well-known phenomenon and is also referred to as the "Brazil nut effect". In
principle, when a mixture containing discrete particles of different sizes is vibrated, the
larger particles tend to move upwardly, against gravity. In this specification, the phrase
"granular convection" is to be regarded as having the same meaning as "stratification".

                                                17
[0122]       It will be appreciated that the longer the particulate material remains on the
shield 40, the more the effect of granular convection, up to a certain degree. Thus, the
action of reducing the effective area 36 has the effect of increasing granular convection
and thus also emphasising or amplifying a reduction in Dd.
[0123]       This can be particularly useful for reducing a level of fines in a particulate
material prior to feeding that particulate material to a secondary crusher. Thus, in one
application, the effective area 36 can be reduced to such an extent that the use of the
screening apparatus 10 is significantly limited to a pre-processing operation for the
secondary crusher 18. In that application, the screening apparatus 10 can also achieve a
high proportion of fines product for feeding into other products or for use by itself.
[0124]       In figures 9 and 10, reference numeral 100 generally indicates an exemplary
embodiment of a shield member for the apparatus 10.
[0125]       A discharge end portion 102 defines several fingers 104, extending in a
discharge direction. The fingers 104 are spaced to define consecutive discharge zones
106.
[0126]       Each of the fingers 104 has a base 108 and a free end 110. The base 108 is
wider than the free end 110 so that each finger 104 tapers towards the discharge end
42.
[0127]       An upper surface 112 of the shield 100 defines a series of furrows, grooves
or channels 114 that extend longitudinally, terminating between the fingers 104. The
channels 114 are dimensioned so that, as a result of granular convection, and gravity,
finer material, such as fines and smaller particulate matter can move into the channels
114 out of the remainder of the particulate material positioned on the shield 100.
[0128]       The fingers 104 can have various lengths depending on the required
application. For example, the fingers 104 can have a length of between about 300 mm
and 500 mm for processing crushed quarry material.
[0129]       In other various exemplary embodiments, just the fingers 104, without the
channels 114, can be provided. Alternatively, just the channels 114, without the fingers
104, can be provided.
[0130]       It is to be appreciated that the fingers 104 provide access for the fines and
finer material to the screen assembly 20 before the larger particulate material. This is
further amplified by using the channels 114.
[0131]       The inventor(s) envisages that the mat or shield member need not
incorporate the features of the shield member 100.

                                                18
[0132]        The apparatus 10 can be used in other applications. For example, with
multiple shields, the control arrangement 70 can be used to control the shields to deliver
articles to discrete apertures. This could be used for delivery of articles of certain sizes
to associated apertures or openings. This would be useful for sorting and distribution.
[0133]        Where reasonable, the shield member 100 can find application in the various
apparatus, accessories and systems described in the specification. For example, in the
various accessories described below, the mats can be in the form of the shield member
100.
[0134]        In figure 11, reference numeral 200 generally indicates the principle of
granular convection as applied to the screening or separation of particulate material. The
principle illustrated in this drawing is used by the various systems, apparatus and
accessories described in the specification to enhance screening or separation of
particulate material. As such, the description of the principle is to be understood as being
applicable to the various systems, apparatus and accessories described herein.
[0135]        At a feed end 202 of the shield 40, a layer 204 of the particulate material or
aggregate contains a mixture of aggregate material having a range of sizes in a region
206. As the shield 40 vibrates, in the manner described above, fines within the layer 204
begin to move downwardly as the aggregate moves in the direction of an arrow 208
towards the discharge end 32. This results in a fines region 210 developing on the shield
40 and growing thicker towards the discharge end 32. As this occurs, a region 212 of the
aggregate containing a reduced level of fines develops and becomes thicker towards the
discharge end 32.
[0136]        At the discharge end 32, fines from the fines region 210 are discharged from
the shield 40 onto the deck 22. The discharge of the fines occurs before the discharge of
the aggregate from the region 212 because of the position of the fines region 210. Thus,
with a suitable selection of the deck 22, the screenings can include a significantly higher
proportion of fines than would be the case without the shield 40 and the granular
convection occurring as a result of the vibration of the shield 40.
[0137]        It will readily be appreciated that the longer the particulate material remains
on the shield 40, the greater the extent of granular convection and thus the
concentration or proportion of fines forming the screenings. For example, the proportion
of fines would be less at a position of the discharge end 32 indicated by a dotted line 214
than a position indicated by a dotted line 216 which, in turn, would be less than that
indicated by a dotted line 218. Thus, adjustment of a position of the shield 40 relative to

                                              19
the deck 22 can be carried out to adjust a proportion of fines forming the screenings of
the deck 22.
[0138]       In figures 12 to 14, reference numeral 300 generally indicates an example of
an accessory for use with a screening or separating apparatus.
[0139]       The accessory 300 includes a support structure in the form of a support
frame 302. The support frame 302 includes a base member 304. Two pairs of wheels or
casters 306 are mounted on the base member 304. The casters 306 are configured to
engage a pair of rails (not shown) positioned behind a feed end 307 of a screen deck
309 of a screening apparatus or assembly so that the support frame 302 can be wheeled
towards and away from the screen deck.
[0140]       The support frame 302 includes a framework 308 that is mounted on the
base member 304. The framework 308 includes a roller support structure 310 positioned
above the base member 304.
[0141]       A drum roller assembly 312 is mounted on the roller support structure 310.
The assembly 312 includes a drum roller 314 that is rotatably mounted on a hub 315.
One end 316 of a mat 318 is secured to the drum roller 314 so that the mat 318 can be
rolled onto the drum roller 314 upon rotation of the drum roller 314. The drum roller 314
defines a slot 320. The end 316 is received in the slot 320 and secured therein by
fasteners, such as bolts 322. More particularly, in cross-section, the drum roller 314 has
an inward spiral with the slot 320 defined between an external portion 324 and an
internal portion 326.
[0142]       The drum roller assembly 312 incorporates a rotary drum drive mechanism,
such as a rotary hydraulic drive, generally indicated at 328. The hydraulic drive 328 can
be actuated with a suitable controller, such as a PLC or some other data processing
device to rotate the drum roller 314 about the hub 315 to wind the mat 318 onto and off
the drum roller 314. As is known, rotary hydraulic drives are reversible. It follows that the
hydraulic drive 328 can rotate the drum roller 314 clockwise or anticlockwise depending
on whether the mat 318 is to be extended or retracted. Furthermore, the rotary hydraulic
drive 328 can be controlled by suitable actuation, for example, by a PLC.
[0143]       A guide arrangement 330 is mounted on the roller support structure 310 and
is configured to permit a drive roller assembly 332 to be mounted above the drum roller
assembly 312 and to be displaceable towards and away from the drum roller 314.
[0144]       The drive roller assembly 332 includes a drive roller 334 that can bear
against the mat 318 so that the mat 318 is pinched between the drum roller 314 and the

                                                20
drive roller 334. A linear displacement drive mechanism 336 is engaged with a hub 342
of the drive roller 334 and is operable to drive the drive roller 334 towards and away from
the drum roller 314.
[0145]       The guide arrangement 330 is configured so that axes of rotation of the drum
roller 314 and the drive roller 334 are positioned in a plane that is angled rearwardly.
[0146]       The guide arrangement 330 includes two guide assemblies 338 mounted on
respective sides of the roller support structure 310 so that the drive roller 334 is
positioned between the guide assemblies 338. Each guide assembly 338 includes a pair
of guide rails 340 so that a hub 342 of the drive roller assembly 332 can be received
between the guide rails 340 of each pair. The guide rails 340 extend rearwardly from the
roller support structure 310.
[0147]       The drive roller assembly 332 includes a rotary hydraulic drive, generally
indicated at 344. The hydraulic drive 344 can also be actuated with a suitable controller
such as a PLC or some other data processing device, as described in further detail
below.
[0148]       Thus, actuating the hydraulic drives 328, 344 can result in movement of the
mat 318 backwards and forwards, as indicated by an arrow 346 to define the adjustment
mechanism described above.
[0149]       A series of guide rails 348 are mounted on the roller support structure 310 to
support the mat 318 as it moves to and fro. A distal guide roller 350 is mounted on a
distal end of each guide rail 348 and a proximal guide roller 352 is mounted on a
proximal end of each guide rail 348. The word "distal" refers to a position that is
relatively distant from the drum roller assembly 312 while the word "proximal" refers to a
position that is closer to the drum roller assembly 312 when compared to the distal guide
roller 350.
[0150]       Generally, in the specification, the word "distal" relates to a position that is
closer to the feed end 307 of the deck 309 than the "proximal" position.
[0151]        It will be appreciated that an effective diameter of the drum roller assembly
312 increases as the mat 318 is rolled onto the drum roller 314. The displacement drive
336 is configured to accommodate resultant movement of the drive roller 334 relative to
the drum roller 314 while still maintaining an appropriate amount of pressure on the mat
318 to facilitate displacement of the mat 318.
[0152]       The position of the drum roller assembly 312 is selected so that a length 353
of the mat 318 from the proximal guide rollers 352 to a region of contact with the drive

                                                21
roller 334 is inhibited from being angled upwardly. Excessive upward angling of the
length 353 could result in the mat 318 losing contact with the proximal guide rollers 352,
which would be undesirable.
[0153]       The distal guide rollers 350 allow that portion of the mat 318 that extends
from the guide rollers 350 to be angled downwardly to some degree without the mat 318
being damaged by ends of the guide rails 348.
[0154]       A mat scraper 354 is positioned to engage an upper surface 356 to scrape
material off the mat 318, so protecting the rollers 314, 334. The scraper 354 can have
various profiles. In figure 14, the scraper 354 is shown with an arcuate profile.
Furthermore, the scraper 354 can be angled in a horizontal plane with respect to a
direction of movement of the mat 318 so that material striking the scraper 354 can be
diverted off the mat 318. The scraper 354 could, for example, define a forward-facing
apex so that the material is diverted off both sides of the mat 318.
[0155]        It will be appreciated that, in use, a significant amount of tension can be set
up in the belt or mat 318. Thus, a fastening arrangement, such as a turnbuckle 311, is
mounted on each side of the base member 304 to connect the base member 304 to the
rails. The turnbuckle 311 inhibits the accessory 300 from tipping over towards the deck
of the apparatus, in use.
[0156]        In figures 15 to 17, reference numeral 400 generally indicates an example of
an accessory for use with a screening or separating apparatus.
[0157]       The accessory 400 includes a drum roller assembly 426 that is mounted on
the roller support structure 310. The drum roller assembly 426 includes a drum roller 430
that is rotatable with respect to a hub 428 that is mounted on the roller support structure
310. The drum roller assembly 426 includes a drive mechanism, for example, a rotary
hydraulic drive 432 to rotate the drum roller 430. The hydraulic drive 432 can be
actuated by a suitable controller such as a PLC or some other data processing device to
be driven either clockwise or anticlockwise. The hub 428 incorporates a braking
mechanism, generally indicated at 434, to brake the drum roller 430 against rotation.
The braking mechanism 434 can also be actuated by the controller so that braking of the
drum roller 430 can be selected or deselected, manually or automatically.
[0158]        In this example, there are two guide arrangements 410, in the form of a
forward guide arrangement 410.1 and a rear guide arrangement 410.2. Each of the
guide arrangements 410 are similar to the guide arrangement 330.

                                               22
[0159]       The guide arrangement 410.1 is configured so that the drive roller assembly
332 is mounted above the drum roller assembly 426 to be displaceable towards and
away from the drum roller 430. The position of the forward guide arrangement 410.1 is
such that the axes of rotation of the drum roller 314 and the drive roller 334 are
positioned in a plane that is angled forwardly with respect to the mat 318.
[0160]       The guide arrangement 410.2 is configured to permit an idler roller assembly
to be mounted above and rearwardly of the drum roller assembly 426 to be displaceable
towards and away from the drum roller 430.
[0161]       The guide arrangements 410.1 and 410.2 include two guide assemblies
412.1 and 412.2 mounted on respective sides of the roller support structure 310 so that
the drive roller assembly 332 and the idler roller assembly 414 are mounted between
respective guide assemblies 412.1 and 412.2. The guide assemblies 412 include
respective pairs of guide rails 416.1 and 416.2. The guide rails 416.2 extend rearwardly
from the roller support structure 310 while the guide rails 416.1 extend forwardly from
the roller support structure 310.
[0162]       The idler roller assembly 414 includes a hub 418 engaged with the guide
rails 416.1 and an idler roller 420 rotatably mounted on the hub 418. A displacement
drive mechanism 422 is engaged with the hub 418 to drive the idler roller 420 towards
and away from the drum roller 430.
[0163]       The accessory 400 includes a shield or shield member in the form of a mat
436. The mat 436 is configured to perform a similar function to that performed by the mat
318. However, the characteristics of the mat 436 make it more suitable for being
interposed between the drum roller 430 and the drive roller 334, and the drum roller 430
and the idler roller 420, respectively, rather than being wound onto the drum roller 314.
[0164]       Thus, when the drive and drum rollers 334, 430 are driven in opposite
directions, simultaneously, the mat 436 can be driven forwards or backwards to define
the adjustment mechanism described above.
[0165]       A contact portion 424 of the mat 436, that makes contact with the drum roller
430, can extend from the drive roller 334 to the idler roller 420. A length of the contact
portion 424 can be adjusted, to some extent, by appropriate displacement of one or both
of the drive and idler rollers 334, 420. Thus, in cases where gripping of the mat 436 is
necessary, the displacement mechanisms 336, 422 can be actuated to drive the drive
and idler rollers 334, 420 towards the drum roller 314. Alternatively, in cases where the
mat 436 is required to be released or a gripping pressure is to be reduced, the

                                              23
displacement mechanisms 336, 422 can be actuated to drive the drive and idler rollers
334, 420 away from the drum roller 314. This would be useful for releasing the mat 436,
for example, for maintenance
[0166]       The accessory 400 is particularly suited for those cases in which the mat 436
is thicker and bulkier than the mat 318. In such cases, the mat 436 may not be able to
be wound onto the drum roller 314, conveniently. In this case, the mat 436 extends
rearwardly from the idler roller 420 and is supported on a further idler roller 438, away
from the framework 308 simply to hang down under gravity.
[0167]       In figures 18 to 21, reference numeral 500 generally indicates an accessory
for a screening apparatus.
[0168]       In this example, the mat 318 is wound onto the drum roller 314 in the manner
described above with reference to the accessory 300.
[0169]       The mat 318 is displaced making use of a reciprocating linear drive
mechanism 502. The linear drive mechanism 502 includes two hydraulic cylinders 504
mounted on a support frame 506, with the mat 318 extending between the hydraulic
cylinders 504 and over the distal and proximal guide rollers 350, 352.
[0170]       A piston 508 extends from each cylinder 504. The cylinder 504 is double
acting to allow the piston 508 to be reciprocated. The cylinder 504 is connected to a
suitable controller such as a PLC, see below with reference to figure 27, for example, or
some other processing device so that the piston 508 can be extended or retracted
manually or under the control of an automated system.
[0171]       A clamping assembly 510 is arranged on the ends of the pistons 508. The
clamp assembly 510 is operable to clamp the mat 318. The clamping assembly 510
includes two opposed, elongate clamp members 512 that extend from one side of the
mat 318 to another side of the mat 318 with the mat 318 interposed between the clamp
members 512. The clamping assembly 510 is capable of being actuated with the PLC or
some other processing device. In use, the clamping assembly 510 is operable to clamp
the mat 318, between the clamp members 512, prior to extension of the pistons 508, so
extending the mat 318 as the drum roller 314 rotates to accommodate the extension of
the mat 318. The clamping assembly 510 is also operable to release the mat 318 prior to
retraction of the pistons 508 so that, after retraction, the clamping assembly 510 can be
operable to clamp the respective side of the mat 318 to extend the mat 318 further when
the piston 508 is extended again.

                                               24
[0172]       In this embodiment, provision needs to be made for the extent of travel of the
pistons 508. Thus, the support frame 506 includes an extension 513 that carries a roller
carriage 515 that extends upwardly from the extension 513. A guide roller 517 is
mounted on the carriage 515 to support the mat 318 on a discharge side of the clamping
assemblies 510 when the clamping assemblies 510 are extended. This facilitates
transition of the belt or mat 318 from the accessory 500 to the deck of the screening
apparatus.
[0173]       The hub 315 incorporates a braking mechanism 511. The braking
mechanism 511 is configured to retard or inhibit rotation of the drum roller 314 while the
sides of the mat are released by the clamping assembly 510. The braking mechanism
511 is configured to be operated by a controller together with the clamping assemblies
510 so that the timing of operation of the braking mechanism 511 and the clamping
assemblies 510 can be controlled to effect extension or retraction of the mat 318 to
define the adjustment mechanism described above.
[0174]       In figures 22 to 24, reference numeral 600 generally indicates an example of
an accessory for use with a screening assembly.
[0175]       The accessory 600 includes two spaced rails 602 capable of being fastened
to a substrate or simply positioned on the substrate.
[0176]       A wheeled support structure 604 is positioned on the rails 602 so that the
support structure can be wheeled to and fro along the rails 602. The support structure
604 includes two support panels 606. Two wheels or casters 608 are mounted on a
lower edge of each support panel 606 to engage respective rails 602. A braking or
locking assembly 609 can be operatively associated with each caster 608 so that, once
the structure 604 is in its operative position, the braking assemblies 609 can be used to
lock the structure 604 in position.
[0177]       A lockdown mechanism 611 can be used to lock the support structure 604 to
the rails 602 once the support structure 604 is in its operative position. It will be
appreciated that a significant amount of force can be exerted on the roller assemblies,
via the mat, in use. The lockdown mechanism 611 can serve to inhibit the support
structure 604 from tipping towards the deck.
[0178]       A number of structural members interconnect the support panels 606. For
example, three elongate structural members or beams 610 interconnect the support
panels 606.

                                              25
[0179]       The roller assemblies include a drum roller assembly 612. The drum roller
assembly 612 includes a drum roller 614 mounted on a shaft 616. One end 620 of a mat
618 is secured to the drum roller 614 so that rotation of the drum roller 614 can cause
the mat 618 to wind onto or off the drum roller 614. The mat 618 performs a similar
function to the mat 318. The mat 318 can be reciprocally displaced over guide rails 622
and an idler roller 624 to define the adjustment mechanism described above.
[0180]       A hydraulic drive mechanism in the form of a hydraulic drive motor 670 is
mounted on the shaft 616 to extend from a slotted opening 672 defined in one of the
support panels 606
[0181]       The roller assemblies also include a drive roller assembly 626. The drive
roller assembly 626 includes a shaft 628 that is rotatably mounted between the support
panels 606 with bearing assemblies 630. A drive roller 634 is fixed, coaxially, to the shaft
628. A drive mechanism in the form of a hydraulic drive 632 is mounted on one end of
the shaft 628 to rotate the shaft 628 and thus the drive roller 634.
[0182]       The drive roller 634 engages the drum roller assembly 612 such that rotation
of the drive roller 634, when driven by the drive 632, causes the mat 618 to extend or
retract depending on a direction of rotation of the drive roller 634.
[0183]       The drive roller 634 bears against the mat 618 that is wound about the drum
roller 614. Thus, as the mat 618 is wound onto the drum roller 614, a spacing between
the drum roller 614 and the drive roller 634 must, of necessity, increase to accommodate
the mat 618. Inversely, as the mat 618 is wound off the roller 614, a spacing between
the roller 614 and the roller 634 must, of necessity, decrease so that the roller 634 can
continue to bear against the mat 618 to drive the roller 614.
[0184]       To accommodate this, the drum roller assembly 612 is displaceable relative
to the support panels 606. This can be achieved in several ways, some examples of
which have been described above with reference to the various embodiments of the
accessory.
[0185]       In this example, the drum roller 612 is mounted on a cradle assembly 636.
The cradle assembly 636 is spring mounted on one of the beams 610 such that
movement of the cradle assembly 636 away from the drive roller assembly 626 is
against a bias of a spring mechanism 638.
[0186]       The cradle assembly 636 includes four cradle arms 640 that are spaced
apart and pivotally mounted on one of the support beams 610 to be pivotal in respective
vertical planes. Four carriers 646 are mounted on free ends of respective cradle arms

                                             26
640 with pivot pins 642 so that the carriers 646 are pivotal with respect to the respective
cradle arms 640. Two carrier rollers 648 are rotatably mounted on the carriers 646 in a
parallel, spaced apart configuration. The carrier rollers 648 are biased into engagement
with the drum roller assembly 612 by the spring mechanism 638 so that the wound mat
618 bears against the carrier rollers 648. Thus, the carrier rollers 648 rotate to
accommodate rotation of the drum roller assembly 612 while the spring mechanism 638
is configured to generate a required pressure between the drive roller 634 and the
wound mat 618 to facilitate driving of the drum roller assembly 612 by the drive roller
assembly 626.
[0187]       The spring mechanism 638 includes a series of spring assemblies 650. Each
spring assembly 650 includes a spring rod 651 pivotally mounted, at one end, to one
respective cradle arm 640. Each spring assembly 650 includes an upper spring plate
652 and a lower spring plate 654. A coil spring 656 is interposed between respective
pairs of plates 652, 654.
[0188]       The shaft 616 is rotatably mounted on and between two support plates 660.
Each support plate 660 is pivotally mounted on a respective support panel 606. Each
support plate 660 is also fixed to a respective end of a tensioning bar 662. Four lugs 664
are mounted on the tensioning bar 662 to extend from the tensioning bar 662 to be
positioned beneath respective lower spring plates 654. Each of the spring rods 651
extends through a respective lug 664. Each of the lower spring plates 654 is
displaceable relative to the respective spring rod 651 towards and away from the upper
spring plates 652. Thus, displacement of the lugs 664 and thus the lower spring plates
654 towards the upper spring plates 652 serves to compress the coil spring 656 so
increasing the pressure between the wound mat 618 and the drive roller 634.
Conversely, displacement of the lugs 664 and thus the lower spring plates 654 away
from the upper spring plates 652 serves to extend the coil spring 656 so decreasing the
pressure between the wound mat 618 and the drive roller 634.
[0189]       A drive mechanism is engaged with each support plate 660 and is operable
to pivot the support plate 660 and thus the tensioning bar 662 to adjust a tension within
the coil springs 656. The drive mechanism can be in the form of a hydraulic cylinder and
piston arrangement 665 mounted on one of the support panels 606.
[0190]       A scraper 658 is mounted between the support panels 606. The scraper 658
includes a transverse bar 664 that extends between the support panels 606 and is
pivotal with respect to those panels 606 so that the scraper 658 can be moved into and
out of operative engagement with the mat 618.

                                              27
[0191]       A scraping member 666 is mounted on the bar 664. The scraping member
666 defines a guide surface 668 that is angled with respect to a direction of travel of the
mat 618 to ensure that particulate material or aggregate is diverted off the mat 618 while
the mat 618 is being retracted to inhibit damage to the roller assemblies.
[0192]       In figure 26, reference numeral 800 generally indicates a schematic of a
screening apparatus.
[0193]       In this embodiment, a hydraulic ram mechanism 802 is suspended from a
support structure 804. A roller 806 is rotatably mounted on an end of a piston 808 of the
ram mechanism 802.
[0194]       A mat 810 is fixed, at one end, to an anchor 812. A free end of the mat 810
is positioned on a screen deck 814. The mat 810 passes between a pair of driven rollers
816 which are operable to drive the free end of the mat 810 towards a discharge end of
the deck 814. A proximal portion 817 of the mat 810 extends from the anchor 812 over
the roller 806 and over a further roller 818. The roller 818 the anchor .812 are positioned
so that when the roller 806 is driven downwardly by the piston 808, an effective length of
the proximal portion 817 is increased, serving to retract the mat 810. When the piston
808 is retracted, the effective length of the proximal portion 817 is decreased and the
rollers 816 serve to extend the mat 810 towards the discharge end of the deck 814. In
this manner, the adjustment mechanism described above is defined.
[0195]       In the following paragraphs, reference is made to the accessory and the
various components thereof described with reference to figures 12 to 25. The numerals
have been omitted for the purposes of clarity only. Such omission should not be
regarded as indicating that the components described below have no association with
the embodiments of the accessory described above. Furthermore, the inventor(s)
envisages that the accessory described below could also be in the form of the accessory
described in the other figures, with minimal modification.
[0196]       In use, the accessory is displaced, using the casters and rails, towards the
feed end 307 of the deck 309 of a screening apparatus. The accessory finds particular
application with multi-deck screening apparatus. Thus, the accessory is configured for
use with a bottom deck of such an apparatus. In these cases, the accessory can be
positioned within about 250 mm to 500 mm from a feed end of the deck. In those
embodiments in which the accessory is mounted on rails, the rails could be arranged
behind the screening apparatus to terminate about 500 mm from a feed end of the deck.

                                               28
[0197]        As is known, such screening apparatus have a curtain 313 (figure 12) of an
elastomeric material, such as rubber, that depends from an upper deck to the bottom
deck. The purpose of this curtain is to inhibit aggregate material from being rejected
rearwardly from the deck. Particularly with generally horizontal decks, the vibrational
pattern created by the vibrators is set up so that material naturally moves from the feed
end to the discharge end of the decks. Thus, the mat will naturally be drawn towards the
discharge end of the deck. This can be constrained, for example, by the braking
mechanisms in the roller assemblies described above. For example, the mat can be
released until a desired length of the mat is positioned on the deck. That length can be
determined in a number of ways. For example, encoders are described below with
reference to controlling the accessory. Otherwise, proximity detectors mounted on the
deck can be used to detect the discharge end of the mat. In another example, a
measuring wheel can be engaged with the mat to measure the extent of movement of
the mat. The measuring wheel can be configured to generate a digital output for reading
by, for example, the PLC described below.
[0198]        When in position, the mat of the accessory can be pushed under the curtain
313 to lift the curtain as indicated by an arrow 315 in figure 12 and to bear against the
bottom deck. The mat can then be extended along the bottom deck using any of the
mechanisms described above. It will be appreciated that the vibrational pattern of the
apparatus will serve to draw the mat out, as well. The accessory is configured so that the
mat angles downwardly from the accessory onto the deck. This facilitates feeding of the
mat onto the deck. An example of a suitable drop would be between about 50 mm and
100 mm.
[0199]        Once in place, the mat of the accessory is retained to some degree on the
deck 309. Thus, when the accessory is used, the step of pushing the mat under the
curtain does not have to be repeated.
[0200]        The corners of a leading edge of the mat can be clipped to stop the mat from
catching. For example, the leading edge of the mat can define 450 mitres.
[0201]        It will be appreciated that, when handling material such as aggregate from a
quarry, the weight of the material can inhibit movement of the mat when the screening
apparatus is inoperative, without damage to the hydraulic drive mechanisms. Thus, the
accessory can include a manual winch mechanism that can be used to retract the mat.
[0202]        In the various embodiments described above, the accessory is wheeled into
and out of operative engagement with the screening apparatus. The inventor(s)
envisages that the accessory can be brought into and out of operative engagement with

                                               29
the screening apparatus using other mechanisms. These could include swinging or
pivoting the apparatus into position from a side of the screening apparatus. In that case,
the accessory could be suspended. Alternatively, the accessory could have pivotal
wheels allowing the accessory to be steered into position.
[0203]       In the various embodiments described above, it is clear that gripping and
displacing the mat is carried out by rollers. It follows that the rollers can have surfaces
that are configured to facilitate such gripping. Thus, the rollers can have projections or
other formations, such as teeth, that can impinge into the mat to enhance gripping.
These projections or formations are selected so as not to damage the mat, especially
the upper surface of the mat.
[0204]       In the various embodiments described above, the hydraulic drives have been
attached to the shafts of the rollers to drive the shafts. The inventor(s) envisages that
various other arrangements may be used. Other drives such as internal combustion
engines with gearboxes could be used instead of rotary hydraulic drives.
[0205]       As can be seen above and in the drawings, in those cases where a pair of
opposed rollers are used to drive the belt, those rollers can be offset. This can enhance
a contact area between the mat and the rollers, so enhancing the ability of the rollers to
displace the mat.
[0206]       The various accessories described above can include a cover to protect the
various mechanisms such as the roller assemblies from the ingress of rocks and stones
and other detritus. The cover can also be configured to protect personnel operating
around the accessories.
[0207]       In a number of the embodiments described above, cameras have been
described as being able to obtain video signals relating to the characteristics of in feed
and outfeed of the aggregate or particulate material. The inventor(s) envisages that, in
addition to cameras, or instead of cameras, other types of scanners could be used. For
example, x-rays could be used to analyse the feeds. Another way of determining the rate
of feed is to measure the power consumption of the drive mechanisms for the feeding
arrangements. It will be appreciated that the greater the power consumption, the higher
the feed rate.
[0208]       The accessories described above can be incorporated into the screening
apparatus to form part of the screening apparatus and supplied together with the
screening apparatus.

                                               30
[0209]        In a number of the embodiments described above, the roller assemblies are
described as being positioned on a support structure such as a framework.
[0210]        In some instances, it may be desirable that the mat be completely released
from the accessory. For example, if the mat becomes stuck under a load of particulate
material during a break down or maintenance of the screening apparatus, it could be
convenient simply to disengage the remainder of the accessory from the mat. Thus, the
accessory could include a quick-release mechanism for releasing the mat from the drum
roller. In a number of the accessories described above, the quick release mechanism
can be provided by the linear drive mechanisms used to displace the drive and idler
roller assemblies.
[0211]        As described above, the position of the mat is related to the characteristics of
the screenings and the discharge. Thus, the accessory can be used to alter or set the
characteristics of the screenings and the discharge.
[0212]        In particular, and with reference to the illustrative drawing in figure 11, the
accessories are particularly useful for enhancing fines collection from a feed of
aggregate using the principles of granular convection described above. As is clear from
the description relating to figure 11, the accessories are useful for manually or
automatically adjusting a position of the mat to achieve different fines proportions within
screenings.
[0213]        Figure 27 shows a schematic layout of various components that are used for
controlling the position of the mat on the deck.
[0214]        The accessory includes a PLC 700 that can be programmed as described
below. The PLC 700 receives inputs from the rotary hydraulic drives described above
and indicated at 702 for convenience. The PLC 700 also receives inputs from various
encoders, indicated at 704, that are mounted on the rollers, or operatively arranged with
respect to the rollers, to determine the extent of extension or retraction of the mat.
[0215]        A modem 706 is connected to the PLC 700 to receive data relating to the
operation of the various components.
[0216]        A user interface 708 is configured to receive data from the modem 706.
[0217]        A data storage device 710 is also connected to the user interface so that
operational data can be stored for subsequent retrieval.
[0218]        The user interface 708 is configured to provide an operator with visual
feedback relating to the running condition of the various components of the accessory.
The user interface 708 is configured so that the operator can make various selections

                                              31
and other adjustments to effect real-time operation. Together with the data storage
device 710, which could be incorporated into the user interface 708, there is provided
capability for data logging.
[0219]        The modem 706 is configured to retrieve data logs from the data storage
device 710 and to update the PLC 700 in order to alter operational characteristics. The
modem 706 is also configured to diagnose faults that may be represented in the data
received by the modem 706 and to report those faults to the user interface 708.
[0220]        Various nodes can be used to bring inputs into the PLC 700. Such inputs
could be in the form of signals relating to feed rate from the weightometers 19, 83. The
feed rates could be represented by separate signals relating to infeed rate and outfeed
rate received from the respective weightometers 19, 83.
[0221]        Other inputs could include data relating to operation of a hydraulic circuit that
is used to drive the hydraulic motors described above. Other data could relate to aspects
of the hydraulic circuit and hydraulic motors such as system pressure, temperature and
filter condition. Furthermore, the inputs could be used by the PLC 700 to control
operation of the hydraulic motors using suitable feedback processes.
[0222]        The user interface 708 can incorporate a touchscreen display with suitable
screen layouts to provide information relating to, for example, infeed and outfeed rates
based on data received from the weightometers, and mat position based on data
received from the encoders.
[0223]        The user interface 708 is configured to permit the input of data. The data
input can relate to a desired mat position, a selection of manual or automatic operation,
manual control of the mat position, and various other inputs that would facilitate
operation of the accessory.
[0224]        The components described above for control of the system are configured so
that the accessory can operate in a manual mode or in an automatic mode. In the
manual mode, the operator can directly control the position of the mat to extend or
retract the mat as necessary. The user interface 708 and/or the PLC 700 can
incorporate a safety feature that inhibits the mat from being adjusted without vibration of
the deck. The reason for this is that there may be a significant weight of unscreened
material positioned on the mat. In that situation, operation of the accessory could result
in damage to the roller assemblies, particularly the drive mechanisms described above.
[0225]         In automatic mode, the mat position is adjusted automatically to follow a
preselected condition. For example, the PLC 700 can be programmed to adjust a

                                                32
position of the mat to achieve certain, desired screening and discharge characteristics.
The PLC 700 can be programmed to define a control loop that is sufficiently damped to
avoid constant movement of the mat and to facilitate overall average performance rather
than targeting instantaneous accuracy. In this way, control of the accessory can be
stable and not unduly disturbed by inconsistent infeed rate.
[0226]       In use, the accessory can be controlled manually using the components
described above and to generate information relating to a relationship between mat
position, infeed rate, outfeed or discharge rate, and, if necessary, screenings
characteristics, such as rate or composition. As has been described above, the variables
need not be limited to rate. For example, with certain materials, the variables can be in
the form of values related to composition of the screenings and discharge. In this way,
the information can form a library that can be indexed and retrieved by the components
when used in an automatic mode. For example, the user interface 708 can be used to
select a desired discharge rate based on a predetermined infeed rate. The user interface
708 can access settings for the PLC 700 from the data storage device 710 so that the
mat position can be automatically set without the need for manual adjustment.
[0227]       The user interface 708 can be configured to log data received from the
various components via the modem 706.
[0228]       In figure 28, reference numeral 720 generally indicates a flowchart that could
be used for programming a control system for controlling operation of the accessory and,
more particularly, for positional control of the mat.
[0229]       At 721, the process is started and at 722 the PLC 700 queries whether an
automatic mode is operational.
[0230]       If a result of the query is "yes", control passes to a control loop 724. At the
control loop, a tracking variable 726 is introduced to a summing junction 728. The
tracking variable could be infeed rate, outfeed rate, or any other variable described
above that could be used to assess whether the mat should be extended or retracted.
[0231]       It will be appreciated that it would be undesirable for the mat to respond
immediately to feedback. Apart from the problems associated with lack of damping, the
operational characteristics of the screening apparatus may require that a certain
condition needs to be maintained for a length of time before a feedback signal can be
regarded as accurate. For example, in a quarry, the material being fed onto the shield or
screen usually does not have consistent characteristics. Thus, the rate can fluctuate.

                                                33
[0232]       In order to address this, the PLC 700 is programmed to execute a delay at
730. At 732, the PLC 700 runs a query as to whether a position of the mat is less than
desired. If "yes", the PLC 700 signals an appropriate hydraulic motor(s) to operate so as
to extend the mat at 742. If "no" the PLC 700 queries, at 734, as to whether a position of
the mat is greater than desired. If "yes" the PLC 700 signals an appropriate hydraulic
motor(s) to operate so as to retract the mat at 740.
[0233]       At 722, if "no", the PLC 700 queries, at 736, as to whether the screening
apparatus is operating. If "yes", the process moves to the query at 732. If "no", the PLC
700 queries, at 737, whether the screen is running. If "yes", control passes to 732. If "no"
the PLC 700 queries, at 738, whether a bypass is active. If "yes", the process moves to
the query at 732.
[0234]       Experimental work was carried out to test the principles described above. A
flexible mat or shield, comprised of conveyor belting, was cut to fit a vibrating screen
surface. The mat was found to work in two ways on aggregate or particulate material
positioned on the mat. The mat reduced the available open area on the screen, so
decreasing a rate of passage of fine sized particles or fines through the screen. The mat
also provided time for the fines within the aggregate to form a layer, as a result of
granular convection or stratification, facilitating the classification of those fines as they
are discharged from an end of the mat.
[0235]       To summarise, the hypothesis tested by the experimental work was that a
reduced open area on a screen would modify the size distributions of the oversized and
undersized products, so providing greater control of product specifications to meet
different market requirements. This would occur through a combination of a reduced
screening time and an increased stratification effect.
[0236]       During screening, particles are presented to the screen surface and given an
opportunity to pass through apertures into an undersized stream. Particles larger than
the screen apertures have zero probability to pass into the undersized stream. Particles
smaller than the apertures have a probability of between zero and one, depending on
the prevailing screen conditions.
[0237]       In general, the probability of the smaller-than-apertures sized particles to
pass into the undersized stream will decrease as the available open area decreases.
However, all particles, large and small, compete for the opportunity to be presented to
the open area. If part of the screen surface is covered, the feed materials will stratify as
they travel along the length of the screen that is closed. The extent of stratification

                                                     34
      depends on the length of travel, among other variables such as vibration, slope, et
      cetera.
      [0238]       It follows that the degree of stratification will increase as a percentage of
      screen coverage is increased. This results in finer particles concentrating closer to the
      screen surface, separating more effectively when presented to the screen open area.
      [0239]       To simplify the analysis in the experiments, the percentage of sub- screen
      material in the feed reporting to the undersized product was used as the criteria for
      defining screening efficiency.
      [0240]       The following tables provide a summary of results. Two markers were
      selected to represent the content of fines in of over-sized (O/S) and under-sized (U/S)
      products. These were the -2.36 mm and the -0.6 mm size fractions.
