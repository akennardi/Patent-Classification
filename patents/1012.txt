[0015]               Before any embodiments of the invention are explained in detail, it is to be
understood that the invention is not limited in its application to the details of construction and
the arrangement of components set forth in the following description or illustrated in the
following drawings. The invention is capable of other embodiments and of being practiced or
of being carried out in various ways.
DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0016]               With reference to FIG. 1, a high angle conveyor 10 is illustrated having a frame
14, a lower continuous conveyor belt 18, an upper continuous conveyor belt 22, and pressing
assemblies 26. The lower conveyor belt 18 and the upper conveyor belt 22 are arranged in an
endless sandwich configuration to conveyor material 30 (FIG. 3) between the lower and upper
conveyor belts 18, 22 at large angles with respect to horizontal. For example, the high angle
conveyor 10 may transport material 30 at a steep conveying angle up to 900 vertical.
[0017]               With reference to FIGS. 1-3, the frame 14 of the high angle conveyor 10 extends at
an angle with respect to horizontal and includes top frame members 34 and side frame
members 38. In some embodiments, the frame 14 may include a staircase 42 that ascends
9752704_1 (GHMatters) P107452.AU

                                                             -3
alongside the lower and upper conveyor belts 18, 22. Idler roller assemblies 46 are positioned
beneath the lower conveyor belt 18. The idler roller assemblies 46 each include idler rollers
50 that are rotatable supported on an idler frame 54. In the illustrated embodiment, the idler
rollers 50 in each idler roller assembly 46 are positioned such that the rotational axes 58 (FIG.
3) of the idler rollers 50 are not aligned (i.e., the idler rollers 50 rotate about axes 58 that are
transverse to each other). Such an arrangement of the idler rollers 50 forms a trough shape
into which the material 30 is received between the lower and upper conveyor belts 18, 22
(FIG. 3).
[0018]               With reference to FIG. 2, both the lower conveyor belt 18 and the upper conveyor
belt 22 are continuous conveyor belts. Specifically, the lower conveyor belt 18 includes a
lower conveying belt portion 62 and a lower return belt portion 66, and the upper conveyor
belt 22 includes an upper conveying belt portion 70 and an upper return belt portion 74. The
lower return belt portion 66 is supported by lower belt support rollers 78. The upper return
belt portion 74 is supported by upper belt support rollers 82 coupled to the frame 14.
[0019]               With continued reference to FIGS. 1-3, the pressing assemblies 26 are coupled to
the frame 14 and bias the upper conveyor belt 22 toward the lower conveyor belt 18, as
described in further detail below. Each of the pressing assemblies 26 includes a bracket 86
pivotally coupled to the frame 14. The bracket 86 includes an A-frame 90 and a roller support
94. In the illustrated embodiment, the A-frame 90 is pivotally coupled to the frame 14 and the
roller support 94 is pivotally coupled to the A-frame 90. The roller support 94 rotatably
supports pressing rollers 98 that engage the upper conveyor belt 22. In the illustrated
embodiment, the pressing rollers 98 are arranged in two rows (FIG. 2), with four pressing
rollers 98 in each row (FIG. 3). Specifically, the roller support 94 includes linkages 102 that
rotatably support the pressing rollers 98.
[0020]               Each of the pressing assemblies 26 further includes a spring support 106 coupled
to the frame 14.                 In the illustrated embodiment, the spring support 106 is secured to the top
frame member 34 by, for example, a welding process. The spring support 106 includes bolts
110, an upper plate 114, and a lower plate 118 that is adjustably positioned with respect to the
upper plate 114 via adjustment of nuts 122 corresponding to the bolts 110. A spring 130 is
included in each of the pressing assemblies 26 and is positioned between the bracket 86 and
9752704_1 (GHMatters) P107452.AU

                                                          -4
the frame 14. In the illustrated embodiment, the spring 130 is positioned between the bracket
86 and the spring support 106.
[0021]               The spring support 106 further includes a cylindrical seat 126 (i.e., an upper spring
seat) extending from the lower plate 118, in which an upper end of the spring 130 is received.
In the illustrated embodiment, the cylindrical seat 126 is coaxially aligned with the spring
130. Similarly, the bracket 86 of the pressing assembly 26 includes a lower cylindrical spring
seat 134 in which a lower end of the spring 130 is received. In the illustrated embodiments,
the spring 130 is positioned within (i.e., seated in) the cylindrical spring seats 126, 134,
however, in alternative embodiments, the spring 130 may be positioned around (i.e., on the
outside of) the cylindrical spring seats 126, 134 (see, for example, spring seat 126B of FIGS.
5-6). The spring 130 urges the bracket 86 and the pressing rollers 98 toward the upper
conveyor belt 22 (i.e., toward the upper conveying belt portion 70 and away from the spring
support 106) such that the pressing assembly 26 biases the upper conveyor belt 22 toward the
lower conveyor belt 18, securing the material 30 therebetween. By adjusting the position of
the lower plate 118 with respect to the upper plate 114 via the nuts 122 and the bolts 110, the
amount of pre-tensioning on the spring 130 can be adjusted by an operator. In other words,
the amount of compression on the spring 130 in a resting state of the pressing assembly 26
can be adjusted by repositioning the lower plate 118 with respect to the upper plate 114. In
some embodiments, repositioning of the lower plate 118 is also utilized to initially assemble
and position the spring 130 between the cylindrical spring seats 126, 134.
[0022]               Further details regarding the structure and operation of a typical high angle
conveyor can be found in U.S. Patent No. 4,609,097 to Continental Conveyor and Equipment
Company, Inc., the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.
[0023]               As long as high angle conveyors operate within the manufacturer's specified
capabilities, high angle conveyors functions properly and according to design. However,
problems operating high angle conveyors arise when the high angle conveyor is loaded
beyond its designed capacity (i.e., outside the specified capabilities). For example, in some
instances a large object that exceeds the maximum lump size limits is placed between the
upper and lower conveyor belts 18, 22. When a large amount of material 30 or large object is
positioned between the conveyor belts 18, 22 and passes underneath the pressing assemblies
26, the spring 130 becomes over-compressed. When the spring 130 becomes over
9752704_1 (GHMatters) P107452.AU

                                                          -5
compressed, the spring 130 is forced out of (i.e., ejected from) the upper and lower spring
seats 126, 134. In other words, when the pressing assembly 26 deflects too much in order to
accommodate large material 30, the spring 130 becomes compressed to such an extent that the
spring force generated by the spring 130 causes the spring 130 to pop out of position (i.e., the
spring 130 buckles and becomes free from the spring seats 126, 134). Having the spring 130
become free from the spring seats 126, 134 is undesired due to the potential for the spring 130
to fall large distances, causing damage and injury. This problem of the spring 130 becoming
free from the spring seats 126, 134 would not have been an obvious problem to those skilled
in the art because under normal operating conditions, the spring 130 is adequately held in
position. As such, the problem with the spring 130 of the pressing assembly 26 becoming
free due to over-compression is being raised for the first time herein along with various
embodiments of the invention to solve the problem.
[0024]               With reference to FIGS. 1- 4, a spring retainer 150 according to a first embodiment
of the invention is illustrated. The spring retainer 150 couples the spring 130 to at least one
the frame 14, the bracket 86, or the spring support 106. In the illustrated embodiment, the
spring retainer 150 is shown coupling the spring 130 directly to the frame 14 (i.e., the top
frame member 34). The spring retainer 150 includes a cable 154 (e.g., a steel cable). The
spring retainer 150 further includes a first thimble 158 at a first end 162 of the cable 154 and a
second thimble 166 at a second end 170 of the cable 166. Specifically, with reference to FIG.
4, fittings 172 secure the first thimble 158 and the second thimble 166 to the cable 154. The
spring retainer 150 further includes an eye bolt 174 coupled to the frame 14. In alternative
embodiments, the eye bolt 174 may be any suitable fastener to which the second end 170 of
the cable 154 may be secured. In further alternatives, the cable 154 may be a high strength
cable with a nylon coating (e.g., an aircraft cable), a zip tie, or any other suitable cable of
sufficient strength.
[0025]               With reference to FIG. 4, the first thimble 158 is coupled to the spring 130 and the
second thimble 166 is coupled to the eye bolt 174. Specifically, the first thimble 158 is
positioned around a circular cross-sectional portion 178 of the spring 130 such that the first
thimble 158 and corresponding cable 154 are operable to move with respect to the spring 130
without creating excessive frictional wear. Likewise, the second thimble 166 is positioned
around a circular cross-sectional portion 182 of the eye bolt 174 such that the second thimble
9752704_1 (GHMatters) P107452.AU

                                                          -6
166 and the corresponding cable are operable to move with respect to the eye bolt 174 without
creating excessive frictional wear. As such, the first end 162 of the cable 154 is coupled to
the spring 130 and the second end 170 of the cable 154 is coupled to the frame 14. In
alternative embodiment, the second end 170 of the cable 154 is coupled to any suitable
stationary structure around the spring 130. For example, in further alternative embodiments,
the second end 170 of the cable 154 is coupled to either the bracket 86 or the spring support
106.
[0026]               As a result of the spring retainer 150, the spring 130 is constrained to the location
surrounding the spring support 106 and bracket 86. As such, should the spring 130 become
free from the upper and lower spring seats 126, 134 due to excessively large material passing
through the high angle conveyor 10, the spring 130 will stay secured to the remainder of the
high angle conveyor 10 by the spring retainer 150. In this way, the spring 130 will not free
fall but is rather secured (i.e., anchored) to the area immediately surrounding the spring 130
(i.e., the frame 14, the spring support 106, the bracket 86, etc.).
[0027]               With reference to FIGS. 5 and 6, a spring retainer 250 according to second
embodiment of the invention is illustrated. The spring retainer 250 includes a fastener 254
(e.g., a L-shaped bolt). The L-shaped bolt 254 includes a first end 258 coupled to the lower
plate 118 of the spring support 106, and a second end 262 coupled to a cylindrical spring seat
126B. In other words, the L-shaped bolt 254 extends between the lower plate 118 and the
cylindrical seat 126B. The cylindrical spring seat 126B is similar to the cylindrical spring
seat 126 of FIGS. 1-4, except that the cylindrical spring seat 126B has a smaller diameter such
that the spring 130 is positioned around the cylindrical spring seat 126B.
[0028]               With continued reference to FIGS. 5 and 6, the first end 258 of the L-shaped bolt
254 is threaded and passes through a hole 266 formed in the lower plate 118. A
corresponding nut 270 secures the first end 258 to the lower plate 118. The second end 262
passes through a hole 278 formed in the cylindrical spring seat 126B. In the illustrated
embodiment, the hole 266 and the hole 278 are larger in diameter than the L-shaped bolt 254,
such that the L-shaped bolt 254 can be assembled by, for example, inserting the second end
262 through the hole 278 first followed by inserting the first end through the hole 266. As
such, the L-shaped bolt 254 extends into an interior space 282 (FIG. 6) defined by an outer
periphery 286 of the spring 130. In other words, a portion of the L-shaped bolt 254 extends
9752704_1 (GHMatters) P107452.AU

                                                         -7
into the spring 130 (i.e., passes between coils of the spring). Similar to the spring retainer
150, the spring retainer 250 constrains the spring 130 to the location surrounding the spring
support 106, securing the spring 130 to the remainder of the high angle conveyor 10.
[0029]               With reference to FIG. 7 and 8, a spring retainer 350 according to a third
embodiment of the invention is illustrated. The spring retainer 350 includes a U-shaped
bracket 354 having a first leg 358, a second leg 362, and an intermediate portion 366
extending between the first leg 358 and the second leg 362. The intermediate portion 366 of
the U-shaped bracket 354 extends through the spring 130 and each of the first leg 358 and the
second leg 362 are coupled to the cylindrical seat 126 of the spring support 106. In particular,
fasteners 370 secure the first and second legs 358, 362 to the cylindrical seat 126. The
intermediate portion 366 partially covers an opening 128 defined by the cylindrical support
126 in which the spring 130 is received. As such, once the spring retainer 350 is assembled,
the spring 130 is secured to the spring support 106. Similar to the spring retainers 150, 250,
the spring retainer 350 constrains the spring 130 to the location surrounding the spring
support 106, securing the spring 130 to the remainder of the high angle conveyor 10.
[0030]               With reference to FIG. 9 and 10, a spring retainer 450 according to a fourth
embodiment of the invention is illustrated. The spring retainer 450 includes a fastener 454
(i.e., a L-shaped bolt). The L-shaped bolt 454 includes a first end 458 coupled to the lower
plate 118 of the spring support 106, and a second end 462 coupled to the cylindrical spring
seat 126. In other words, the L-shaped bolt 545 extends between the lower plate 118 and the
cylindrical seat 126. In the illustrated embodiment, the spring 130 is received within the
cylindrical seat 126. The first end 458 of the L-shaped bolt 454 is threaded and passes
through a hole 466 formed in the center of the lower plate 118. A corresponding nut 470
secures the first end 458 to the lower plate 118. The second end 462 passes through a hole
478 formed in the cylindrical spring seat 126. In the illustrated embodiment, the hole 466 and
the hole 478 are larger in diameter than the L-shaped bolt 454 to facilitate assembly. As such,
the L-shaped bolt 454 extends into an interior space 482 (FIG. 10) defined by an outer
periphery 486 of the spring 130. In other words, a portion of the L-shaped bolt 454 extends
into the spring 130 (i.e., passes between coils of the spring). Similar to the spring retainers
150, 250, 350, the spring retainer 450 constrains the spring 130 to the location surrounding
