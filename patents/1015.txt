ABSTRACT
A method and system for facilitating appraisals of vehicles has sales staff computing or
communications devices [2] management staff devices [3] and wholesaler devices [4], all
of which are connectable over a network [7] to a web-based platform [6].           Users at
devices [2] enter data which is relevant to the appraisal of a vehicle. A substantially real
time alert is generated at management staff devices [3] that appraisal data is available
for consideration. Wholesalers at devices [4] receive a substantially real-time alert that
appraisal data is available for consideration for the purpose of making an offer on a
vehicle and management users at devices [3] receive a substantially real-time alert when
a wholesaler has made an offer to purchase a vehicle.

FIELD OF INVENTION
[001]       It will be convenient to hereinafter describe the invention in relation to the
appraisal of motor vehicles, such as trucks, motorcars/automobiles, motorbikes and
mobile homes.        However, the present invention is not limited to that use only.      For
example, it is equally applicable to other products such as non-land based vehicles such
as aircraft and watercraft.
BACKGROUND
[002]       Throughout this specification the use of the word "inventor" in singular form
may be taken as reference to one (singular) inventor or more than one (plural) inventor of
the present invention.
[003]       It is to be appreciated that any discussion of documents, devices, acts or
knowledge in this specification is included to explain the context of the present invention.
Further, the discussion throughout this specification comes about due to the realisation
of the inventor and/or the identification of certain related art problems by the inventor.
Moreover, any discussion of material such as documents, devices, acts or knowledge in
this specification is included to explain the context of the invention in terms of the
inventor's knowledge and experience and, accordingly, any such discussion should not
be taken as an admission that any of the material forms part of the prior art base or the
common general knowledge in the relevant art in Australia, or elsewhere, on or before
the priority date of the disclosure and claims herein.
[004]       Most sales by motor vehicle dealerships involve the trade-in of a vehicle in part
payment for another vehicle, which may itself be either a new vehicle or a second-hand
vehicle. Accordingly, motor vehicle dealers need to be able to appraise the value of a
traded-in vehicle.       Such   appraisal   includes the gathering     (by  sales  staff) of
comprehensive information about a potential trade-in vehicle, including make, model,
vehicle identification number, and condition (including any damage).        Dealerships are
also generally linked with wholesale networks, to which the dealerships sell traded-in
vehicles. Dealerships need to be able to send comprehensive appraisal information to a
wholesale network or networks to receive a purchase offer back from the wholesale

                                               2
network/networks. A dealership and a wholesale network may be separate divisions of
the same organization.
[005]       Currently in Australia the process of obtaining appraisals is conducted by using
emails and by texting.         This process is essentially manually-driven and manually
monitored.      That is, throughout the customer enquiry and appraisal request, various
human participants in the process must manually gather data into a form which is
meaningful to other participants and manually transmit that data.             In cases where
wholesalers do not respond to a request for an offer, manual/human action is necessary
to ascertain whether or not a request was successfully sent and received, or to ascertain
whether a lack of response indicates a lack of interest in making an offer. Similarly,
when wholesalers do not receive any response to an offer, the wholesaler will not know
whether the lack of response indicates a failure in communications or a lack of interest in
the offer that was made.
[006]       The preceding discussion of background art is intended to facilitate an
understanding of the present invention only. The discussion is not an acknowledgement
or admission that any of the material referred to is or was part of the common general
knowledge as at the priority date of the application.
SUMMARY OF INVENTION
[007]       It is an object of the embodiments described herein to overcome or alleviate at
least one of the above noted drawbacks of related art systems or to at least provide a
useful alternative to related art systems.
[008]      Accordingly, in one aspect, embodiments of the present invention provide a
method of facilitating the appraisal of a vehicle, the method comprising the steps of:
       entering, at a computing or communications device which is connectable to a
       communications network, data which is relevant to the appraisal of a vehicle or
       the like;
       transmitting that data to the communications network; and
       generating, at one or more other such computing or communications devices, a
       substantially real-time alert that the data is available for consideration.

                                                3
[009]        In another aspect, embodiments of the present invention provide a method of
facilitating the appraisal of a vehicle, the method comprising the steps of:
         generating, at one or more computing or communications devices which is
         connectable to a communications network, a substantially real-time alert that
         appraisal data which is relevant to the appraisal of a vehicle or the like is available
         for consideration;
and in which:
         that appraisal data has been entered at one or more other such computing or
         communications devices which are connectable to the communications network.
[0010]       Other aspects and preferred forms are disclosed in the specification and/or
defined in the appended claims, forming a part of the description of the invention.
[0011]       The present invention stems from the realisation that a need existed for better
communication methods and transparency between a host of interested parties when
trading and wholesaling vehicles. Technology allowed various platforms to capture the
information effectively but the invention stems from the need to communicate this
information and how different parties receive varying portions of this information to
facilitate a transaction, this is now achieved by sending selectively varying portions of the
information via push notifications to multiple parties involved in the deal.
[0012]       In contrast, embodiments of the present invention allow the flow of information
at and within a dealership and between a dealership and their wholesale network to be
sent in real time with live alerts of appraisals sent and of offers made.
[0013]       Advantages provided by the present invention comprise the following:
a        increased data transfer efficiency;
e        provides instant notifications to multiple users of various actions required to
         complete a task, resulting in the benefit of tasks being completed in a timely
         manner;
a        real time data access of moving inventory within a dealership network;
a        allows multiple levels of management to be informed of stock movements and
         deals; and
a        allows wholesalers to conduct their business remotely.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0016]      Embodiments      of the present invention       allow users   on computing      or
communications devices to be alerted, in real time, to product appraisal enquiries that
require various actions. The appraisal enquiries with their associated information and
data are preferably communicated via push notifications which preferably include live
links to a software app. Suitable computing or communications devices include personal
tablets and smart phones (such as Apple or Android devices) and networked computers.
[0017]      As is illustrated in figure 1, a system which implements embodiments of the
present invention comprises a network 7 to which are connected communications
devices 2     for   sales   staff,  communications      devices 3 for   management      staff,
communications devices 4 for wholesalers, and a web-based platform 6 which is located
in the cloud.
[0018]      According to the presently-described preferred embodiments of the invention,
there are four flows of data which are described below with reference to the flowchart 20
of figure 2.
[0019]      The first flow of data is from sales staff to management users in a dealership.
Members of sales staff log into the system 1 using communications devices 2.             The
processes of logging in, and of registering new sales staff users and new management
users, are illustrated in figures 3 to 5.    Once logged in, users are presented with the
menu options which are illustrated in figure 6. Although figures 3 to 5 do not illustrate the
screens for the capture of the actual data about new users, those screens, and the data
which is captured, are in accordance with general principles in the art.       Nonetheless,
figure 33 shows a screen shot of a screen for 'add dealer' and figures 34 and 35 show
use of this screen input of the interface used by management staff users and sales staff
users, respectively, for registration.
[0020]      The user interface options and displays of figures 3 to 17 are used by both
sales and management staff. The menu option and notification of figures 18 and 19,

                                              6
respectively, are available to management staff, only. The screen display of figure 20
illustrates an example of a special case. This can be used by both management and
sales staff, however, the 'view' button on the right-hand side of each cell of the screen is
only seen and/or used by management users.          Its main purpose is to be used by the
management staff, and the sales staff will rarely use it, but it is accessible on the sales
staff accounts.
[0021]      Members of sales staff greet customers who are looking to sell or trade their
vehicle. Sales staff then input the relevant information including appraisal data (process
21 in flowchart 20) and take relevant photos of the vehicle. The data fields which are
captured for the purposes of the dealership obtaining an appraisal are illustrated in
figures 7 to 17. This information is then sent over the network 7 (process 22) to a senior
staff member(s) in the same organisation referred to as a "Management User(s)".
[0022]      Management      users are logged on to the system 1 at communications
devices 3. This management user is instantly alerted to incoming information via a "push
notification" (which is illustrated in figure 30) that requires them to review, modify if
necessary and then finally send to their wholesale division.        It is preferred that the
system 1 allows the information to be sent to multiple management users via this push
notification process as two or more management users may wish to review (process 23)
and may, subject to a deliberation (decision point 24), at least amend (process 25) the
information being sent.
[0023]      The second data flow is from the management user(s) to a wholesaler user(s).
When the management user has reviewed and made any necessary changes to the
information they have received from the sales user they now send this data to a
wholesaler or wholesalers so that they, the sales/management, can receive offers back
from the wholesaler(s). All information needed to make an accurate assessment of the
vehicles value is sent to the wholesaler, including general photos and damage photos.
At this point (process 26) the wholesaler in real time receives a push notification alert
(which is illustrated in figure 31). The wholesaler clicks the push notification to review
the notification (process 27 of figure 2) and the communication device 4 displays and the
wholesaler is taken to the wholesale app. The wholesale app presents a menu (which is
illustrated in figure 21) and, on choosing the "received appraisal" menu item, the
wholesaler can access the screens which are illustrated in figures 22 and 24 to 29. All

                                              7
the relevant details of the vehicle that are necessary for them to access the value and
decide    if they will     make    an  offer are  presented   to  the wholesaler(s).      A
wholesaler/wholesalers can make an offer by clicking on the "make an offer" button
(which is illustrated in figure 29).
[0024]      The third data flow is an offer from a wholesaler, or wholesalers, to the
management user. At this point the wholesaler has reviewed the detail sent to them via
push notification and they are ready to submit an offer back to the management user
who notified them of the vehicle. When this offer (process 29) is sent the management
user who sent the details instantly receives a push notification (which is illustrated in
figure 32) alerting them of who has made the offer and what price this user has offered.
This can be occurring with multiple wholesalers sending multiple offers and is not
capped.
[0025]      The fourth data flow is from the management user to a wholesaler. Now the
management user has received all offers, has reviewed the offers (process 30) and is
ready to accept the best offer. The management user now awards (process 32) the
winning offer via a push notification which is sent to the selected wholesaler.        The
wholesaler receives this notification and accepts or can call the management user who
sent the push notification to them.
[0026]      Every step of this process is documented in a web based platform and stored
in the cloud.
[0027]      While   this invention    has been   described  in connection     with specific
embodiments thereof, it will be understood that it is capable of further modification(s).
This application is intended to cover any variations uses or adaptations of the invention
following in general, the principles of the invention and including such departures from
the present disclosure as come within known or customary practice within the art to
which the invention pertains and as may be applied to the essential features
hereinbefore set forth.
[0028]      As the present invention may be embodied in several forms without departing
from the spirit of the essential characteristics of the invention, it should be understood
that the above described embodiments are not to limit the present invention unless
otherwise specified, but rather should be construed broadly within the spirit and scope of

                                               8
the invention as defined in the appended claims. The described embodiments are to be
considered in all respects as illustrative only and not restrictive.
[0029]     Various modifications and equivalent arrangements           are intended to be
included within the spirit and scope of the invention and appended claims. Therefore,
the specific embodiments are to be understood to be illustrative of the many ways in
which the principles of the present invention may be practiced.      In the following claims,
any means-plus-function clauses are intended to cover structures as performing the
defined function and not only structural equivalents, but also equivalent structures. For
example, although a nail and a screw may not be structural equivalents in that a nail
employs a cylindrical surface to secure wooden parts together, whereas a screw
employs a helical surface to secure wooden parts together, in the environment of
fastening wooden parts, a nail and a screw are equivalent structures.
The following sections I - VII provide a guide to interpreting the present specification.
1. Terms
[0030]     The term "product" means any machine, manufacture and/or composition of
matter, unless expressly specified otherwise.
[0031]     The term "process" means any process, algorithm, method or the like, unless
expressly specified otherwise.
[0032]     Each process (whether called a method, algorithm or otherwise) inherently
includes one or more steps, and therefore all references to a "step" or "steps" of a
process have an inherent antecedent basis in the mere recitation of the term 'process' or
a like term. Accordingly, any reference in a claim to a 'step' or 'steps' of a process has
sufficient antecedent basis.
[0033]     The term "invention" and the like mean "the one or more inventions disclosed
in this specification", unless expressly specified otherwise.
[0034]     The      terms    "an   embodiment",     "embodiment",     "embodiments",      "the
embodiment", "the embodiments", "one or more embodiments", "some embodiments",
"certain embodiments", "one embodiment", "another embodiment" and the like mean

                                              9
"one or more (but not all) embodiments of the disclosed invention(s)", unless expressly
specified otherwise.
[0035]     The term "variation" of an invention means an embodiment of the invention,
unless expressly specified otherwise.
[0036]     A reference to "another embodiment" in describing an embodiment does not
imply that the referenced embodiment is mutually exclusive with another embodiment
(e.g., an embodiment described before the referenced embodiment), unless expressly
specified otherwise.
[0037]     The terms "including", "comprising" and variations thereof mean "including but
not limited to", unless expressly specified otherwise.
[0038]     The terms "a", "an" and "the" mean "one or more", unless expressly specified
otherwise.
[0039]     The term "plurality" means "two or more", unless expressly specified otherwise.
[0040]     The term "herein" means "in the present specification, including anything which
may be incorporated by reference", unless expressly specified otherwise.
[0041]     The phrase "at least one of", when such phrase modifies a plurality of things
(such as an enumerated list of things), means any combination of one or more of those
things, unless expressly specified otherwise. For example, the phrase "at least one of a
widget, a car and a wheel" means either (i) a widget, (ii) a car, (iii) a wheel, (iv) a widget
and a car, (v) a widget and a wheel, (vi) a car and a wheel, or (vii) a widget, a car and a
wheel. The phrase "at least one of', when such phrase modifies a plurality of things,
does not mean "one of each of" the plurality of things.
[0042]     Numerical terms such as "one", "two", etc. when used as cardinal numbers to
indicate quantity of something (e.g., one widget, two widgets), mean the quantity
indicated by that numerical term, but do not mean at least the quantity indicated by that
numerical term.     For example, the phrase "one widget" does not mean "at least one
widget", and therefore the phrase "one widget" does not cover, e.g., two widgets.
[0043]     The phrase "based on" does not mean "based only on", unless expressly
specified otherwise. In other words, the phrase "based on" describes both "based only

                                               10
on" and "based at least on". The phrase "based at least on" is equivalent to the phrase
"based at least in part on".
[0044]     The term "represent" and like terms are not exclusive, unless expressly
specified otherwise. For example, the term "represents" do not mean "represents only",
unless expressly specified otherwise. In other words, the phrase "the data represents a
credit card number" describes both "the data represents only a credit card number" and
"the data represents a credit card number and the data also represents something else".
[0045]     The term "whereby" is used herein only to precede a clause or other set of
words that express only the intended result, objective or consequence of something that
is previously and explicitly recited. Thus, when the term "whereby" is used in a claim, the
clause or other words that the term "whereby" modifies do not establish specific further
limitations of the claim or otherwise restricts the meaning or scope of the claim.
[0046]     The term "e.g." and like terms mean "for example", and thus does not limit the
term or phrase it explains. For example, in the sentence "the computer sends data (e.g.,
instructions, a data structure) over the Internet", the term "e.g." explains that
"instructions" are an example of "data" that the computer may send over the Internet, and
also explains that "a data structure" is an example of "data" that the computer may send
over the Internet.      However, both "instructions" and "a data structure" are merely
examples of "data", and other things besides "instructions" and "a data structure" can be
"data".
[0047]     The term "i.e." and like terms mean "that is", and thus limits the term or phrase
it explains. For example, in the sentence "the computer sends data (i.e., instructions)
over the Internet", the term "i.e." explains that "instructions" are the "data" that the
computer sends over the Internet.
[0048]     Any given numerical range shall include whole and fractions of numbers within
the range. For example, the range "1 to 10" shall be interpreted to specifically include
whole numbers between 1 and 10 (e.g., 2, 3, 4,       . . . 9) and non-whole numbers (e.g.,
1.1, 1.2, . . . 1.9).
II. Determining

                                              11
[0049]      The term "determining" and grammatical variants thereof (e.g., to determine a
price, determining a value, determine an object which meets a certain criterion) is used in
an extremely broad sense.         The term "determining" encompasses a wide variety of
actions and therefore "determining" can include calculating, computing, processing,
deriving, investigating, looking up (e.g., looking up in a table, a database or another data
structure), ascertaining and the like. Also, "determining" can include receiving (e.g.,
receiving information), accessing (e.g., accessing data in a memory) and the like. Also,
"determining" can include resolving, selecting, choosing, establishing, and the like.
[0050]      The term "determining" does not imply certainty or absolute precision, and
therefore "determining" can include estimating, extrapolating, predicting, guessing and
the like.
[0051]      The term "determining" does not imply that mathematical processing must be
performed, and does not imply that numerical methods must be used, and does not imply
that an algorithm or process is used.
[0052]      The term "determining" does not imply that any particular device must be used.
For example, a computer need not necessarily perform the determining.
Ill. Indication
[0053]      The term "indication" is used in an extremely broad sense.            The term
"indication" may, among other things, encompass a sign, symptom, or token of
something else.
[0054]      The term "indication" may be used to refer to any indicia and/or other
information indicative of or associated with a subject, item, entity, and/or other object
and/or idea.
[0055]      As used herein, the phrases "information indicative of' and "indicia" may be
used to refer to any information that represents, describes, and/or is otherwise
associated with a related entity, subject, or object.
[0056]      Indicia of information may include, for example, a symbol, a code, a reference,
a link, a signal, an identifier, and/or any combination thereof and/or any other informative
representation associated with the information.

                                               12
[0057]     In some embodiments, indicia of information (or indicative of the information)
may be or include the information itself and/or any portion or component of the
information. In some embodiments, an indication may include a request, a solicitation, a
broadcast, and/or any other form of information gathering and/or dissemination.
IV. Forms of Sentences
[0058]     Where a limitation of a first claim would cover one of a feature as well as more
than one of a feature (e.g., a limitation such as "at least one widget" covers one widget
as well as more than one widget), and where in a second claim that depends on the first
claim, the second claim uses a definite article "the" to refer to the limitation (e.g., "the
widget"), this does not imply that the first claim covers only one of the feature, and this
does not imply that the second claim covers only one of the feature (e.g., "the widget"
can cover both one widget and more than one widget).
[0059]     When an ordinal number (such as "first", "second", "third" and so on) is used
as an adjective before a term, that ordinal number is used (unless expressly specified
otherwise) merely to indicate a particular feature, such as to distinguish that particular
feature from another feature that is described by the same term or by a similar term. For
example, a "first widget" may be so named merely to distinguish it from, e.g., a "second
widget". Thus, the mere usage of the ordinal numbers "first" and "second" before the
term "widget" does not indicate any other relationship between the two widgets, and
likewise does not indicate any other characteristics of either or both widgets.          For
example, the mere usage of the ordinal numbers "first" and "second" before the term
"widget" (1) does not indicate that either widget comes before or after any other in order
or location; (2) does not indicate that either widget occurs or acts before or after any
other in time; and (3) does not indicate that either widget ranks above or below any
other, as in importance or quality. In addition, the mere usage of ordinal numbers does
not define a numerical limit to the features identified with the ordinal numbers.        For
example, the mere usage of the ordinal numbers "first" and "second" before the term
"widget" does not indicate that there must be no more than two widgets.
[0060]     When    a single device or article is described        herein, more than one
device/article (whether or not they cooperate) may alternatively be used in place of the
single device/article that is described. Accordingly, the functionality that is described as

                                               13
being possessed by a device may alternatively be possessed by more than one
device/article (whether or not they cooperate).
[0061]      Similarly, where more than one device or article is described herein (whether
or not they cooperate), a single device/article may alternatively be used in place of the
more than one device or article that is described. For example, a plurality of computer
based devices may be substituted with a single computer-based device. Accordingly,
the various functionality that is described as being possessed by more than one device
or article may alternatively be possessed by a single device/article.
[0062]      The functionality and/or the features of a single device that is described may
be alternatively embodied by one or more other devices which are described but are not
explicitly described as having such functionality/features.         Thus, other embodiments
need not include the described device itself, but rather can include the one or more other
devices which would, in those other embodiments, have such functionality/features.
V. Disclosed Examples and Terminology Are Not Limiting
[0063]      Neither the Title nor the Abstract in this specification is intended to be taken as
limiting in any way as the scope of the disclosed invention(s). The title and headings of
sections provided in the specification are for convenience only, and are not to be taken
as limiting the disclosure in any way.
[0064]      Numerous embodiments are described in the present application, and are
presented for illustrative purposes only. The described embodiments are not, and are
not intended to be, limiting in any sense. The presently disclosed invention(s) are widely
applicable to numerous embodiments, as is readily apparent from the disclosure. One of
ordinary skill in the art will recognise that the disclosed invention(s) may be practised
with various modifications and alterations, such as structural, logical, software, and
electrical modifications. Although particular features of the disclosed invention(s) may be
described with reference to one or more particular embodiments and/or drawings, it
should be understood that such features are not limited to usage in the one or more
particular embodiments or drawings with reference to which they are described, unless
expressly specified otherwise.

                                              14
[0065]      The present disclosure is not a literal description of all embodiments of the
invention(s). Also, the present disclosure is not a listing of features of the invention(s)
which must be present in all embodiments.
[0066]      Devices that are described as in communication with each other need not be in
continuous communication with each other, unless expressly specified otherwise.          On
the contrary, such devices need only transmit to each other as necessary or desirable,
and may actually refrain from exchanging data most of the time.              For example, a
machine in communication with another machine via the Internet may not transmit data
to the other machine for long period of time (e.g. weeks at a time). In addition, devices
that are in communication with each other may communicate directly or indirectly through
one or more intermediaries.
[0067]      A description of an embodiment with several components or features does not
imply that all or even any of such components/features are required. On the contrary, a
variety of optional components are described to illustrate the wide variety of possible
embodiments of the present invention(s).          Unless otherwise specified explicitly, no
component/feature is essential or required.
[0068]      Although process steps, operations, algorithms or the like may be described in
a particular sequential order, such processes may be configured to work in different
orders. In other words, any sequence or order of steps that may be explicitly described
does not necessarily indicate a requirement that the steps be performed in that order.
The steps of processes described herein may be performed in any order practical.
Further, some steps may be performed simultaneously despite being described or
implied as occurring non-simultaneously (e.g., because one step is described after the
other step). Moreover, the illustration of a process by its depiction in a drawing does not
imply that the illustrated process is exclusive of other variations and modifications
thereto, does not imply that the illustrated process or any of its steps are necessary to
the invention(s), and does not imply that the illustrated process is preferred.
[0069]      Although a process may be described as including a plurality of steps, that
does not imply that all or any of the steps are preferred, essential or required. Various
other embodiments within the scope of the described invention(s) include other
processes that omit some or all of the described steps.         Unless otherwise specified
explicitly, no step is essential or required.

                                              15
[0070]     Although a process may be described singly or without reference to other
products or methods, in an embodiment the process may interact with other products or
methods.      For example, such interaction may include linking one business model to
another business model. Such interaction may be provided to enhance the flexibility or
desirability of the process.
[0071]     Although a product may be described as including a plurality of components,
aspects, qualities, characteristics and/or features, that does not indicate that any or all of
the plurality are preferred, essential or required. Various other embodiments within the
scope of the described invention(s) include other products that omit some or all of the
described plurality.
[0072]     An enumerated list of items (which may or may not be numbered) does not
imply that any or all of the items are mutually exclusive, unless expressly specified
otherwise. Likewise, an enumerated list of items (which may or may not be numbered)
does not imply that any or all of the items are comprehensive of any category, unless
expressly specified otherwise. For example, the enumerated list "a computer, a laptop, a
PDA" does not imply that any or all of the three items of that list are mutually exclusive
and does not imply that any or all of the three items of that list are comprehensive of any
category.
[0073]     An enumerated list of items (which may or may not be numbered) does not
imply that any or all of the items are equivalent to each other or readily substituted for
each other.
[0074]     All embodiments are illustrative, and do not imply that the invention or any
embodiments were made or performed, as the case may be.
VI. Computing
[0075]      It will be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that the various
processes described herein may be implemented by, e.g., appropriately programmed
general purpose computers, special purpose computers and computing devices.
Typically a processor (e.g., one or more microprocessors, one or more micro-controllers,
one or more digital signal processors) will receive instructions (e.g., from a memory or
like device), and execute those instructions, thereby performing one or more processes
defined by those instructions.

                                            16
[0076]     A "processor" means one or more microprocessors, central processing units
(CPUs), computing devices, micro-controllers, digital signal processors, or like devices or
any combination thereof.
[0077]     Thus a description of a process is likewise a description of an apparatus for
performing the process. The apparatus that performs the process can include, e.g., a
processor and those input devices and output devices that are appropriate to perform the
process.
[0078]     Further, programs that implement such methods (as well as other types of
data) may be stored and transmitted using a variety of media (e.g., computer readable
media) in a number of manners. In some embodiments, hard-wired circuitry or custom
hardware may be used in place of, or in combination with, some or all of the software
instructions that can implement the processes of various embodiments. Thus, various
combinations of hardware and software may be used instead of software only.
[0079]     The term "computer-readable medium" refers to any medium, a plurality of the
same, or a combination of different media, that participate in providing data (e.g.,
instructions, data structures) which may be read by a computer, a processor or a like
device. Such a medium may take many forms, including but not limited to, non-volatile
media, volatile media, and transmission media. Non-volatile media include, for example,
optical or magnetic disks and other persistent memory. Volatile media include dynamic
random access memory         (DRAM),   which typically constitutes the main memory.
Transmission media include coaxial cables, copper wire and fibre optics, including the
wires that comprise a system bus coupled to the processor. Transmission media may
include or convey acoustic waves, light waves and electromagnetic emissions, such as
those generated during radio frequency (RF) and infra-red (IR) data communications.
Common forms of computer-readable media include, for example, a floppy disk, a
flexible disk, hard disk, magnetic tape, any other magnetic medium, a CD-ROM, DVD,
any other optical medium, punch cards, paper tape, any other physical medium with
patterns of holes, a RAM, a PROM, an EPROM, a FLASH-EEPROM, any other memory
chip or cartridge, a carrier wave as described hereinafter, or any other medium from
which a computer can read.
[0080]     Various forms of computer readable media may be involved in carrying data
(e.g. sequences of instructions) to a processor. For example, data may be (i) delivered

                                                17
from RAM to a processor; (ii) carried over a wireless transmission medium; (iii) formatted
and/or transmitted according to numerous formats, standards or protocols, such as
Ethernet (or IEEE 802.3), SAP, ATP, Bluetooth T M , and TCP/IP, TDMA, CDMA, and 3G;
and/or (iv) encrypted to ensure privacy or prevent fraud in any of a variety of ways well
known in the art.
[0081]      Thus a description of a process is likewise a description of a computer
readable medium storing a program for performing the process. The computer-readable
medium can store (in any appropriate format) those program elements which are
appropriate to perform the method.
[0082]      Just as the description of various steps in a process does not indicate that all
the   described    steps    are  required,   embodiments      of an    apparatus  include   a
computer/computing device operable to perform some (but not necessarily all) of the
described process.
[0083]      Likewise, just as the description of various steps in a process does not indicate
that all the described steps are required, embodiments of a computer-readable medium
storing a program or data structure include a computer-readable medium storing a
program that, when executed, can cause a processor to perform some (but not
necessarily all) of the described process.
[0084]     Where databases are described, it will be understood by one of ordinary skill in
the art that (i) alternative database structures to those described may be readily
employed, and (ii) other memory structures besides databases may be readily employed.
Any illustrations or descriptions of any sample databases presented herein are illustrative
arrangements for stored representations           of information.     Any  number of other
arrangements may be employed besides those suggested by, e.g., tables illustrated in
drawings or elsewhere.        Similarly, any illustrated entries of the databases represent
exemplary information only; one of ordinary skill in the art will understand that the
number and content of the entries can be different from those described herein. Further,
despite any depiction of the databases as tables, other formats (including relational
databases, object-based models and/or distributed databases) could be used to store
and manipulate the data types described herein. Likewise, object methods or behaviours
of a database can be used to implement various processes, such as the described

                                               18
herein. In addition, the databases may, in a known manner, be stored locally or remotely
from a device which accesses data in such a database.
[0085]      Various embodiments can be configured to work in a network environment
including a computer that is in communication (e.g., via a communications network) with
one or more devices.        The computer may communicate with the devices directly or
indirectly, via any wired or wireless medium (e.g. the Internet, LAN, WAN or Ethernet,
Token Ring, a telephone line, a cable line, a radio channel, an optical communications
line,  commercial     on-line  service   providers, bulletin  board   systems,  a   satellite
communications link, a combination of any of the above).         Each of the devices may
themselves comprise computers or other computing devices that are adapted to
communicate with the computer.           Any number and type of devices may be in
communication with the computer.
[0086]      In an embodiment, a server computer or centralised authority may not be
necessary or desirable. For example, the present invention may, in an embodiment, be
practised on one or more devices without a central authority.      In such an embodiment,
any functions described herein as performed by the server computer or data described
as stored on the server computer may instead be performed by or stored on one or more
such devices.
[0087]      Where a process is described, in an embodiment the process may operate
without any user intervention.       In another embodiment, the process includes some
human intervention (e.g., a step is performed by or with the assistance of a human).
[0088]      It should be noted that where the terms "server", "secure server" or similar
terms are used herein, a communication device is described that may be used in a
communication system, unless the context otherwise requires, and should not be
construed to limit the present invention to any particular communication device type.
Thus, a communication device may include, without limitation, a bridge, router, bridge
router (router), switch, node, or other communication device, which may or may not be
secure.
[0089]      It should also be noted that where a flowchart is used herein to demonstrate
various aspects of the invention, it should not be construed to limit the present invention
to any particular logic flow or logic implementation.        The described logic may be

                                                19
partitioned into different logic blocks (e.g., programs, modules, functions, or subroutines)
without changing the overall results or otherwise departing from the true scope of the
invention.    Often, logic elements may be added, modified, omitted, performed in a
different order, or implemented using different logic constructs (e.g., logic gates, looping
primitives, conditional logic, and other logic constructs) without changing the overall
results or otherwise departing from the true scope of the invention.
[0090]      Various embodiments of the invention may be embodied in many different
forms,    including   computer     program    logic for  use   with  a  processor   (e.g., a
microprocessor, microcontroller, digital signal processor, or general purpose computer
and for that matter, any commercial processor may be used to implement the
embodiments of the invention either as a single processor, serial or parallel set of
processors in the system and, as such, examples of commercial processors include, but
are not limited to Merced T M , Pentium     TM,  Pentium I TM, Xeon TM, Celeron TM,  Pentium
ProTM, Efficeon TM , Athlon T M , AMDTM and the like), programmable logic for use with a
programmable logic device (e.g., a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) or other
PLD), discrete components, integrated circuitry (e.g., an Application Specific Integrated
Circuit (ASIC)), or any other means including any combination thereof. In an exemplary
embodiment of the present invention, predominantly all of the communication between
users and the server is implemented as a set of computer program instructions that is
converted into a computer executable form, stored as such in a computer readable
medium, and executed by a microprocessor under the control of an operating system.
[0091]      Computer program logic implementing all or part of the functionality where
described herein may be embodied in various forms, including a source code form, a
computer executable form, and various intermediate forms (e.g., forms generated by an
assembler, compiler, linker, or locator). Source code may include a series of computer
program instructions implemented in any of various programming languages (e.g., an
object code, an assembly language, or a high-level language such as Fortran, C, C++,
JAVA, or HTML.       Moreover, there are hundreds of available computer languages that
may be used to implement embodiments of the invention, among the more common
being Ada; Algol; APL; awk; Basic; C; C++; Conol; Delphi; Eiffel; Euphoria; Forth;
Fortran; HTML; Icon; Java; Javascript; Lisp; Logo; Mathematica; MatLab; Miranda;
Modula-2; Oberon; Pascal; Perl; PL/I; Prolog; Python; Rexx; SAS; Scheme; sed; Simula;
Smalltalk; Snobol; SQL; Visual Basic; Visual C++; Linux and XML.) for use with various

                                              20
operating systems or operating environments.         The source code may define and use
various data structures and communication messages. The source code may be in a
computer executable form (e.g., via an interpreter), or the source code may be converted
(e.g., via a translator, assembler, or compiler) into a computer executable form.
[0092]      The computer program may be fixed in any form (e.g., source code form,
computer executable form, or an intermediate form) either permanently or transitorily in a
tangible storage medium, such as a semiconductor memory device (e.g, a RAM, ROM,
PROM, EEPROM, or Flash-Programmable RAM), a magnetic memory device (e.g., a
diskette or fixed disk), an optical memory device (e.g., a CD-ROM or DVD-ROM), a PC
card (e.g., PCMCIA card), or other memory device. The computer program may be fixed
in any form in a signal that is transmittable to a computer using any of various
communication technologies, including, but in no way limited to, analog technologies,
digital technologies, optical technologies, wireless technologies (e.g., Bluetooth),
networking technologies, and inter-networking technologies. The computer program may
be distributed in any form as a removable storage medium with accompanying printed or
electronic documentation (e.g., shrink wrapped software), preloaded with a computer
system (e.g., on system ROM or fixed disk), or distributed from a server or electronic
bulletin board over the communication system (e.g., the Internet or World Wide Web).
[0093]      Hardware logic (including programmable logic for use with a programmable
logic device) implementing all or part of the functionality where described herein may be
designed using traditional manual methods, or may be designed, captured, simulated, or
documented electronically using various tools, such as Computer Aided Design (CAD), a
hardware description language (e.g., VHDL or AHDL), or a PLD programming language
(e.g., PALASM, ABEL, or CUPL). Hardware logic may also be incorporated into display
screens for implementing embodiments of the invention and which may be segmented
display screens, analogue display screens, digital display screens, CRTs, LED screens,
Plasma screens, liquid crystal diode screen, and the like.
[0094]      Programmable logic may be fixed either permanently or transitorily in a
tangible storage medium, such as a semiconductor memory device (e.g., a RAM, ROM,
PROM, EEPROM, or Flash-Programmable RAM), a magnetic memory device (e.g., a
diskette or fixed disk), an optical memory device (e.g., a CD-ROM or DVD-ROM), or
other memory device.         The programmable logic may be fixed in a signal that is

                                              21
transmittable to a computer using any of various communication technologies, including,
but in no way limited to, analog technologies, digital technologies, optical technologies,
wireless technologies (e.g., Bluetooth), networking technologies, and internetworking
technologies.     The programmable logic may be distributed as a removable storage
medium with accompanying printed or electronic documentation (e.g., shrink wrapped
software), preloaded with a computer system (e.g., on system ROM or fixed disk), or
distributed from a server or electronic bulletin board over the communication system
(e.g., the Internet or World Wide Web).
[0095]      "Comprises/comprising"      and   "includes/including"   when    used    in  this
specification is taken to specify the presence of stated features, integers, steps or
components but does not preclude the presence or addition of one or more other
features, integers, steps, components or groups thereof. Thus, unless the context clearly
requires otherwise, throughout the description and the claims, the words 'comprise',
'comprising', 'includes', 'including' and the like are to be construed in an inclusive sense
as opposed to an exclusive or exhaustive sense; that is to say, in the sense of "including,
but not limited to".
