              ORIGINAL COMPLETE SPECIFICATION
                             STANDARD PATENT
                                      Invention Title
                                     Vacuum cleaner
The following statement is a full description of this invention, including the best method
                           of performing it known to me/us:
                                             1

            The present invention relates to a vacuum cleaner. In particular the present
   invention relates to improved dust container capacity.
            Vacuum cleaners typically have an on board dirt container for receiving and
 5 storing dirt and debris that has been sucked up from a surface that is being cleaned.
   Periodically the dirt container must be emptied and this can be an undesirable task
   for the user. It is known to increase the volume of the dirt container by providing a
   compaction mechanism in the dirt container. Examples of compaction mechanisms
   are shown in EP 1 671 569 and US 2008/0263815. This squashes the contents of
10 the dirt container and increases the effective volume of the dirt container and means
   that the dirt container can be emptied less frequently.
            A problem with the compaction mechanisms is that dirt and debris can
   accumulate above the compaction mechanism and interfere with the functionality of
15 the compaction mechanism.         This means that the compaction mechanism can
   become less effective or even inoperable.
            Embodiments of the present invention aim to address the aforementioned
   problems.
20
            According to a first aspect of the present invention there is a vacuum cleaner
   comprising: a housing; a motor fan assembly mounted in the housing, the motor fan
   assembly arranged to generate an air flow; a      dirt  container   mountable   on  the
   housing and in fluid communication with a dirty air inlet and the motor fan assembly;
25 a moveable dirt compactor mounted in the dirt container and moveable between a
   stowed position and a dirt compacting position wherein the moveable dirt compactor
   is closer to one end of the dirt container in the dirt compacting position than in the
   stowed position; wherein the vacuum cleaner comprises a detector switch coupled to
   the moveable dirt compactor, the detector switch configured to open an electrical
30 circuit and interrupt power supplied to the motor fan assembly when the moveable
   dirt compactor moves towards the dirt compacting position and urges dirt towards the
   one end of the dirt container.
                                              1a

           This means that the motor fan assembly is not operational when the dirt
   compactor is in a compacting position.        This means that a dirty air flow cannot
   intercept the dirt compactor during use of the dirt compactor. This means that dirt
   and debris sucked up from a surface to be cleaned is less likely to contaminate the
 5 mechanism of the dirt compactor.        This means the dirt compactor requires less
   maintenance.
           Preferably the detector switch is configured to close the electrical circuit and
   supply power to the motor fan assembly when the moveable dirt compactor is in the
10 stowed position.     In this way the detector switch is mechanically coupled to the
   movement of the dirt compactor. This provides a reliable and cost effective
   arrangement. Alternatively or additionally the detector switch can be other types of
   detectors such as an optical detector, or a moving magnet and a hall sensor, a reed
   switch and a moving magnet or any other electrical sensor to detect movement of the
15 dirt compactor.
           Preferably wherein the moveable dirt compactor is coupled to the detector
   switch with an elongate mechanical linkage.          The elongate mechanical linkage
   transfers the force from a handle to the dirt compactor. At the same time the physical
20 movement that actuates movement of the dirt compactor can also be used to detect
   the movement of the dirt compactor.
           Preferably a dirt separator mounted in the dirt container is located in an air
   flow path between the dirty air inlet and the motor fan assembly. This means the dirt
25 separator such as a filter is nested within the dirt container. This makes the vacuum
   cleaner unit more compact and portable.
           Preferably the moveable dirt compactor sweeps a surface of the dirt separator
   when the moveable dirt compactor moves from the stowed position to the dirt
30 compacting position. This means that the outer surface of the dirt separator remains
   free from accumulated dirt and debris because the dirt separator is cleaned each
   time the dirt compactor is operated.      This improves the air flow through the dirt
   separator and the efficiency of the vacuum cleaner unit.
                                             2

            Preferably the moveable dirt compactor engages an inner surface of the dirt
   container. The dirt compactor scrapes dirt between the wall of the dirt container and
   the dirt separator. This means that accumulated hair is pushed out of a relatively
   narrow space into the open space of the dirt container where the dirt separator is not
 5 located by the dirt compactor. This avoids the user having to manually remove dirt
   and debris from the dirt container with their hands.
            Preferably the dirty air inlet is mounted on a wall of the dirt container between
   the moveable dirt compactor in the stowed position and the one end of the dirt
10 container. This means that dirt and debris are not sucked into the dirt container
   when the dirt compactor is operational.           This prevents dirt accumulating and
   contaminating the mechanism of the dirt compactor.
            Preferably the moveable dirt compactor is actuated with a moveable handle
15 mounted on the exterior of the dirt container. The moveable handle allows the user
   to gain purchase and exert the necessary force to move the dirt compactor between
   the stowed and compacting positions.
            Preferably the moveable dirt compactor is biased towards the stowed
20 position. In this way the dirt compactor automatically returns to the stowed position
   after being operated.
            Preferably a spring is mounted in the handle for biasing the moveable dirt
   compactor to the stowed position.          By placing the spring inside the handle, the
25 biasing mechanism can be compact.
            Preferably the one end of the dirt container comprises a door for emptying the
   dirt container. This means that the dirt compactor can be used to compact the dirt in
   the dirt container but also help empty the dirt container when the door is open.
30
            Preferably the door comprises a detent for maintaining the door in an open
   position and the dirt container comprises a first latch for releasing the door. This
   means that the user can easily open the door during an emptying operation.
                                               3

            Preferably the dirt container is removeable from the housing. By removing the
   dirt container from the housing, the user does not need to lift the weight of the battery
   and the motor fan assembly during an emptying operation. Accordingly emptying the
   dirt container can be easier for the user.
 5
            Preferably the detector switch is mounted in the housing. This means that the
   detector switch is only operable when the dirt container is mounted in the housing. In
   this way the detector switch prevents operation of the vacuum cleaner unit when the
   dirt container is removed from the housing.             This prevents dirt and debris
10 contaminating the motor fan assembly when the filter or dirt separator is not present.
            Preferably housing comprises a second latch for releasing the dirt container
   from the housing. This means that the dirt container is less likely to be accidentally
   released from the vacuum cleaner unit.
15
   According to a second aspect, there is provided a vacuum cleaner comprising: a
   housing; a motor fan assembly arranged to generate an air flow; a dirt container in
   fluid communication with a dirty air inlet and the motor fan assembly; a moveable dirt
   compactor mounted in the dirt container and moveable between a stowed position
20 and a dirt compacting position wherein the moveable dirt compactor is closer to one
   end of the dirt container in the dirt compacting position than in the stowed position,
   wherein the movable dirt compactor is shaped so as to allow dirt within the dirt
   container located on one side of the dirt compactor to pass to the other side of the
   dirt compactor; and a detector switch coupled to the moveable dirt compactor, the
25 detector switch configured to open an electrical circuit and interrupt power supplied to
   the motor fan assembly when the moveable dirt compactor moves towards the dirt
   compacting position and urges dirt towards the one end of the dirt container.
   The detector switch may be configured to close the electrical circuit and supply
30 power to the motor fan assembly when the moveable dirt compactor is in the stowed
   position.
   The moveable dirt compactor may be coupled to the detector switch with an elongate
   mechanical linkage.
35
                                              4

   The movable dirt compactor may comprise a top surface and a bottom surface, the
   bottom surface having a greater surface area than the top surface.
   At least a portion of the top surface may contact the dirt container when the movable
 5 dirt compactor is in the stowed position.
   The dirt compactor may comprise one or more sloping surfaces between the top
   surface and the bottom surface.
10 The dirty air inlet may be mounted on a wall of the dirt container between the
   moveable dirt compactor in the stowed position and the one end of the dirt container.
   The moveable dirt compactor may be actuated with a moveable handle mounted on
   the exterior of the dirt container.
15
   The moveable dirt compactor may be biased towards the stowed position.
   A spring may be mounted in the handle for biasing the moveable dirt compactor to
   the stowed position.
20
   The one end of the dirt container may comprise a door for emptying the dirt
   container.
   The dirt container may be removeable from the housing.
25
   The detector switch may be mounted in the housing.
   The dirt compactor may comprise one or more open sections or holes for dirt to pass
   through.
30
   According to a third aspect, there is provided a vacuum cleaner comprising: a
   housing; a motor fan assembly arranged to generate an air flow; a dirt container in
   fluid communication with a dirty air inlet and the motor fan assembly; and a moveable
   dirt compactor mounted in the dirt container and moveable between a stowed
35 position and a dirt compacting position wherein the moveable dirt compactor is closer
                                             5

   to one first end of the dirt container in the dirt compacting position than in the stowed
   position, wherein the movable dirt compactor is shaped such that dirt located above
   the dirt compactor and in the dirt container can pass below the dirt compactor when
   the vacuum cleaner is in the upright position or when the vacuum cleaner is in use.

            Figure 7b shows a bottom perspective view of the dirt compactor.
20
            Figure 1 shows a perspective view of a vacuum cleaner 100. The vacuum
   cleaner 100 comprises a vacuum cleaner unit 102 which is mounted in a chassis
   104. The chassis 104 is optional. In this way the vacuum cleaner 100 is a stickvac
   type vacuum cleaner.      In other embodiments the vacuum cleaner 100 can be any
25 type of vacuum cleaner such as an upright vacuum cleaner, a canister vacuum
   cleaner or a handheld vacuum cleaner.
            The chassis 104 comprises a floorhead 106 for engaging surfaces to be
   cleaned. The floorhead 106 has a floorhead dirty air inlet 110 which is in fluid
30
   communication with a hose 108 of the vacuum cleaner unit 102. The floorhead 106
   is coupled to the chassis body 112 via an articulated joint 114. The articulated joint
   114 permits the floorhead 106 to move with respect to the chassis body 112 in two
   degrees of freedom.      The articulated joint 114 comprises two pivoting joints which
                                               6

   have pivoting axes perpendicular to each other.        The chassis also comprises a
   handle 116 for the user to grip and steer the vacuum cleaner 100 during use.
            The vacuum cleaner unit 102 is releasably removeable from the chassis 104.
 5 The vacuum cleaner unit 102 comprises projecting ribs (not shown) which slot into a
   reciprocal recess (not shown) on the chassis 104. The vacuum cleaner unit is
   mountable on the chassis 104 and locked to the chassis 104 with a latch mechanism
   (not shown). The latch mechanism is operated when the vacuum cleaner unit 102 is
   to be released from the chassis 104.
10
            The vacuum cleaner unit 102 will now be discussed in further detail in
   reference to Figure 2. Figure 2 shows a perspective view of the vacuum cleaner unit
   102.    The vacuum cleaner unit 102 is operable remote from the chassis 104.
   Optionally the vacuum cleaner unit 102 is a stand-alone unit which does not couple
15 to a chassis 104 as shown in Figure 1.
            The vacuum cleaner unit 102 comprises a housing 200. The housing 200
   comprises a clam shell type construction comprises two halves which are fastened
   together. The halves of the housing 200 are fastened together with screws but in
20 alternative embodiments any suitable means for fastening the housing together may
   be used such as glue, clips, bolts and so on.
            The vacuum cleaner unit 102 comprises a motor fan assembly 300 which is
   best shown in Figure 3.      Figure 3 shows a perspective cross section view of the
25 vacuum cleaner unit 102. The motor fan assembly 300 comprises a motor 302 and a
   fan 304 for generating a negative pressure for sucking up dirt and debris via the dirty
   air inlet 204. The motor fan assembly 300 is housed within the housing 200 and
   electrically connected to a power source 306. The power source 306 is a battery
   comprising a plurality of battery cells. In other embodiments the vacuum cleaner unit
30 102 additionally or alternatively comprises a mains electricity supply (not shown).
            The motor fan assembly 300 is actuated with a first switch 202. The first
   switch 202 is a main ON/OFF switch which controls power to the motor fan assembly
   300.
                                             7

            Turning    back to Figure 2,       the motor fan assembly 300 is in fluid
   communication with a dirty air inlet 204. The dirty air inlet 204 is coupled to a first
   end 206 of the hose 108 which couples to the floorhead 106 as shown in Figure 1.
   The first end 204 of the hose 108 comprises a hose coupling mechanism 212. The
 5 hose coupling mechanism 212 selectively couples the first end 204 of the hose 108
   to the floorhead 106.       This means that the hose 108 does not accidentally come
   loose from the floorhead 106.           Additionally the hose coupling mechanism 212
   selectively couples the first end 204 to one or more accessories. The accessories
   that couple to the first end 204 can be one or more from the following; a brush, a
10 crevice tool, a pet hair tool, a scrubber, an extension tube, a powered brush unit or
   any other suitable cleaning tool. The hose coupling mechanism 212 comprises a
   sprung biased pivoting latch 214. The latch 214 is biased to a locked position and
   when the user wishes to release the first end 204 from an accessory, the use
   depresses a button 216 and the latch moves to an unlocked position and disengages
15 from the accessory permitting its removal. When the user releases the button 216,
   the latch snaps back into the locked positon. The hose coupling mechanism 212 is
   optional and the first end 204 of the hose 108 may comprise any other suitable
   means for mounting accessories thereto. For example the accessories may screw fit
   or push friction fit on to the first end 204.
20
            A second end 208 of the hose 108 is mounted to the housing 200 and in fluid
   communication with a dirt container 210. The second end 208 is mounted to an
   aperture 310 in a wall 218 of the dirt container 210. In this way there is an air flow
   pathway from the dirty air inlet 204 to the dirt container 210 and to the motor fan
25 assembly 300. The motor fan assembly 300 exhausts clean air out via exhausts
   holes 308.
            The second end 208 of the hose mounted on the wall of the dirt container 210
   is better shown in Figure 3. The dirt container 210 comprises a dirt separator 312
30 which is positioned in the airflow path between the dirty air inlet 204 and the motor
   fan assembly 300. The dirt separator 312 comprises a prefilter perforated shroud
   316 which encloses a filter 314. For the purposes of clarity the individual perforations
   of the perforated shroud 316 are not shown. In some embodiments the dirt separator
   312 comprises only either the perforated shroud 316 or the filter 314.           Both the
35 prefilter 316 and the filter 314 separate dirt and debris entrained in the air flow. The
                                               8

   filter 314 is an air permeable pleated filter. The aperture 310 is mounted in the wall
   218 of the dirt container 210 such that the air is inserted tangentially to the dirt
   container 210. This means that the air swirls around in the dirt container 210 before
   the air flow is sucked through the dirt separator 312. The air flow upstream of the dirt
 5 separator 312 is clean and air outputted from the motor fan assembly 300 does not
   contain any dirt or debris entrained in the air flow.    In some embodiments the dirt
   separator 312 is not a pleated filter or a perforated shroud. Instead the dirt separator
   312 is a cyclonic separator or a multistage cyclonic separator.
10          The dirt separator 312 is mounted in a lid 320 at a first end 318 of the dirt
   container 210. The lid 320 is sealed against the wall 218 of the dirt container 210
   and comprises a hole therethrough for mounting the dirt separator 312. The lid 320
   is sealed against the wall 218 of the dirt container 210 with a resilient member 402
   (shown in Figures 4a). The resilient member 402 is an annular rubber seal that is
15 compressed between the lid 320 and the wall 218.
            A second end 322 of the dirt container 210 comprises a hinged door 324.
   The door 324 is sprung biased and hinged at pivot 330. A door release mechanism
   326 releases the door 324 from the dirt container 210. The door release mechanism
20 326 comprises a sprung biased pivoting latch 326. When a user presses the button
   328 of the latch 326, the latch 326 moves into an unlocked position and the door 324
   is urged by the spring in the pivot 330 into an open position.
            In some embodiments the pivot 330 does not have a spring and the door is
25 not sprung loaded. Instead the door 324 has a stop member 442 to ensure that the
   door only opens to a predetermined angle, for example 90 degrees of pivoting
   rotation with respect to the dirt container 210. The door also has a resilient detent
   440 to ensure that the door will stay open when the user empties the dirt container
   210. In this way the door 324 comprises a detent 440 for maintaining the door in an
30 open position. In order for the user to close the door 324 the user pivots the door
   324 until the detent 440 snaps out of position and the door 324 is free to pivot and be
   closed. Optionally the door 324 is spring biased and also comprises the detent 440
   and the stop member 442.
                                             9

           When the door 324 is open, dirt and debris held in the dirt container 210 can
   be emptied into a bin. In other embodiments the door is not sprung biased.
   Furthermore the door release mechanism 326 is alternatively a clip (not shown)
   mounted on the door which engages with a reciprocal recess on the wall 218. Such
 5 a clip may be a living hinge. In yet another embodiment the dirt container 210 does
   not have a door at the second end 322. Instead the dirt container 210 is emptied by
   removing the lid 320 from the dirt container 210.
           Optionally, the dirt container 210 is removeable from the vacuum cleaner unit
10 102. This means that the dirt container 210 can be removed from the housing 200
   and emptied separately from the vacuum cleaner unit 102. This means that the user
   does not have to carry the entire vacuum cleaner unit 102 when emptying the dirt
   container 210. This makes emptying easier because the user does not have to lift
   the weight of the battery 306 and the motor fan assembly 300 when holding the dirt
15 container 210 over the bin. The dirt container is selectively releaseable with a dirt
   container latch mechanism 332. The latch mechanism 332 is biased to a locked
   position and the latch 332 protrudes from the housing 200 into the dirt container 210.
   In order to release the dirt container 210 from the housing 200, the user actuates the
   dirt container latch mechanism 332 by pressing a button (not shown) which is
20 mechanically coupled to the dirt container latch mechanism 332. Pressing the button
   moves the latch 334 from a locked position into an unlocked position. The latch 334
   comprises a cammed surface 336 so that when the dirt container 210 is pushed back
   into the housing 200, the latch 332 snaps back into the locked position. The dirt
   container latch mechanism 332 is optional and the dirt container 210 may be held in
25 the housing 200 with any other suitable means such as a push friction fit.
           During use the dirt and debris sucked up at the dirty air inlet 204 is collected
   in the dirt container 210.      In order to increase the effective volume in the dirt
   container 210, the dirt container 210 comprises a moveable dirt compactor 400. The
30 moveable dirt compactor 400 will now be discussed in further detail with respect to
   Figures 4a and 4b.
           Figures 4a and 4b show a side cross section of the dirt container 210. The
   dirt container 210 has been removed from the vacuum cleaner unit 102. The dirt
35 compactor 400 is operable when the dirt container has been removed from the
                                            10

   vacuum cleaner unit 102.      The dirt compactor 400 is also operable when the dirt
   container 210 is mounted in the vacuum cleaner unit 102.
           Figure 4a shows the dirt container 210 with the dirt compactor 400 in the
 5 stowed position. Figure 4b shows the dirt compactor 400 in the compacting position
   during operation of the dirt compactor 400.
           The dirt container 210 comprises an upstanding handle housing 404
   projecting upwardly from the dirt container wall 218. The handle housing 404 is a
10 hollow wall portion coupled to the wall 218 of the dirt container 210. The handle
   housing 404 comprises a slot 502 (best shown in Figure 5b) for receiving a moveable
   primary handle 406. The moveable primary handle 406 is slidably mounted on in the
   slot 502 in the handle housing 404. The primary handle 406 is coupled to a handle
   mounting element 408 which slidably engages either side of the slot 502. In this way
15 the handle mounting element 408 slides within an internal conduit 410 in the handle
   housing 404 and slides over an external wall 412 of the handle housing 404. This
   means that the handle mounting element 408 and the primary handle 406 are
   retained in the slot when the primary handle 406 is moved. The moveable primary
   handle 406 is moveable between a raised position and a lowered position.
20
           Figure 4a shows the handle 406 in a raised position which corresponds to the
   dirt compactor 400 in a stowed position. The stowed position is a position of the dirt
   compactor 400 that is not compressing the dirt and debris in the dirt container 210.
   Figure 4b shows the handle 406 in a lowered position which corresponds to the dirt
25 compactor 400 in a compacting position. The compacting positon is a position of the
   dirt compactor 400 where dirt and debris in the dirt container 210 are urged towards
   an end 322 of the dirt container 210.
           The primary handle 406 is mechanically coupled to a compression plate 414
30 (or 700) via an elongate linkage 416. The elongate linkage 416 is fixed to the handle
   mounting element 408 and is housed within the internal conduit 410. Accordingly
   movement of the primary handle 406 and the handle mounting element 408 causes a
   corresponding movement in the linkage 416 and the compression plate 414 (or 700).
                                           11

             In some embodiments the linkage 416 is a rigid rod.                In alternative
   embodiments the linkage 416 can be any suitable means for mechanically coupling
   the primary handle 406 to the compression plate 414 (or 700).
 5           The compression plate 414 is an annulus that surrounds the dirt separator
   312 located in the middle of the dirt container 210. The dirt separator 312 protrudes
   through the centre of the annular compression plate 414 when the dirt compactor 400
   is in the stowed position. The dirt separator 312 is cylindrical and a longitudinal axis
   of the cylindrical dirt separator 312 is aligned with the central axis A-A of the dirt
10 separator 312.        Likewise a centre of the annular compression plate 414 is also
   aligned with the centre of the dirt separator 312. In other embodiments the
   compression plate 414 is another shape such as a cog-shape (as shown in figures
   7a and 7b and discussed further below) or a circular cross section or any other
   suitable cross section. In the embodiment that the compression plate is circular, the
15 filter or dirt separator 312 is mounted outside of the dirt container 210. In this way,
   the circular compression plate substantially fills the cross section of the dirt container
   210 such that during operation of the dirt compactor 400 the compression plate
   exerts a force on substantially all the dirt and debris in the dirt container 210.
20           In alternative embodiments, the compression plate of the dirt compactor 400
   may be shaped so as to allow some dirt to pass either side of the dirt compactor.
   This allows any dirt that may end up above the dirt compactor 400 to pass through
   and move below the dirt compactor 400. For example, the dirt compactor 400 may
   comprise a compression plate 700 that is shaped to have an annular section 701 with
25 protruding sections 702 and open sections 703, so as to form a general cog-shape,
   as shown in figures 7a and 7b. The open sections 703 allow any dirt above the dirt
   compactor 400 to fall through the open sections 703 to prevent dirt being trapped
   above the dirt compactor. The open sections 703 may be may be sized so that only
   a small proportion of dirt in the dirt chamber can pass through it when performing
30 compaction. When performing compaction, the annular section 701 and protruding
   sections 702 urge the majority of the dirt and debris in the dirt container 210 towards
   end 322 of the dirt container 210.
             Optionally dirt compression plate 414 engages both an internal surface 418 of
35 the wall 218 of the dirt container and an exterior surface 420 of the dirt separator
                                             12

   312. The dirt compression plate 414 comprises a resilient sweeper 422 that sweeps
   along the internal surface 418 and the exterior surface 422. In some embodiments
   the resilient sweeper is a deformable member that is in constant contact with the
   surfaces 418, 420. The resilient sweeper 422 is a rubber membrane or additionally
 5 or alternatively a plurality of bristles. This means that as the compression plate 414
   moves towards the second end 322, the resilient sweeper sweeps and / or brushes
   across the internal surface 418 of the wall 218 and the exterior surface 420 of the dirt
   separator 312. This means that any stubbornly fixed dirt will be removed from these
   surfaces every time the dirt compactor 400 is operated. Since the resilient sweeper
10 422 engages the perforated shroud 316 of the dirt separator 312, the perforations
   (not shown) in the shroud 316 are kept clean and improve the air flow efficiency of
   the vacuum cleaner unit 102.
            In the embodiment of figures 7a and 7b, dirt compression plate 700 may
15 optionally engage the exterior surface 420 of the dirt separator 312.         The dirt
   compression plate 700 may comprise a resilient sweeper and/or brush (not shown)
   that sweeps along the exterior surface 422 of the dirt separator 312. This means that
   as the compression plate 700 moves towards the second end 322, the resilient
   sweeper sweeps and / or brushes across the exterior surface 420 of the dirt
20 separator 312. This means that any stubbornly fixed dirt will be removed from the
   surface of the dirt separator 312 every time the dirt compactor 400 is operated.
   Since the resilient sweeper engages the perforated shroud 316 of the dirt separator
   312, the perforations (not shown) in the shroud 316 are kept clean and improve the
   air flow efficiency of the vacuum cleaner unit 102.
25
           As mentioned above, the dirt compactor 400 is in the stowed position in
   Figure 4A. In the stowed position, dirt compression plate 414 of the dirt compactor
   400 is located in an uppermost position adjacent to the first end 318 of the dirt
   container and the lid 320. In this way, the position of the dirt compression plate 414
30 ensures that the maximum volume of the dirt container 210 is available for receiving
   the dirt and debris from the dirty air inlet 204. Figure 4a shows the aperture 310 in
   the wall 218 of the dirt separator 210. The dirt compactor 400 is positioned in the
   stowed position such that the aperture 310 is between the dirt compression plate 414
   and the second end 322. This means that during operation of the vacuum cleaner
35 unit 102 when the dirt compactor 400 is in the stowed position, the dirt and debris
                                              13

   entrained in the air flow is not received in the dirt container 210 between the first end
   320 and the dirt compression plate 414.             Keeping the dirt between the dirt
   compression plate 414 and the second end 322 prevents a build-up of hard to
   remove dirt which will interfere and damage the dirt compactor 400.
 5
            In some scenarios (e.g., when the dirt comprises very fine dust or there is an
   imperfect seal between the compression plate 414 and the dirt container 210 or dirt
   separator 312), some dirt may become trapped in the dirt container 210 between the
   first end 320 of the dirt container 210 and the dirt compactor 400. This problem can
10 be solved by providing an opening or passage for dirt to pass through the dirt
   compactor from the side of the first end 320 towards the second end 322, e.g., by
   providing a dirt compactor 400 with the compression plate 700 shown in figures 7a
   and 7b.
15          The primary handle 406 is optionally biased to the raised position.         This
   means that the dirt compactor 400 is biased to the stowed position.         The primary
   handle 406 comprises an internal spring 424 which is coupled to the handle housing
   404 at peg 426. The spring 424 is a constant force coil spring. This means that the
   user only has to exert the same force on the primary handle irrespective of whether
20 the primary handle 406 is in the raised position or the lowered positon or somewhere
   in between. The internal spring 424 is threaded through the internal conduit 410. In
   some embodiments the biasing can be achieved with any suitable biasing means
   such as a coil spring, a leaf spring and so on. The biasing element can be located in
   any suitable position in the vacuum cleaner unit 102 for biasing the dirt compactor
25 400 and the primary handle 406. For example in some embodiments rather that the
   primary handle 406 being biased, the compression plate 414 (or 700) can be coupled
   to the lid 320 with a biasing means such as a spring. In some embodiments there is
   no biasing element and the primary handle 406 is moved between the lowered
   positon and the raised position manually by the user.
30
            In addition to the primary handle 406 the handle housing 404 comprises a
   secondary handle 428. The secondary handle 428 is formed from a through hole in
   the handle housing.      The secondary handle 428 permits the user to grip the dirt
   container 210 whilst also holding the primary handle 406.
35
                                            14

            Operation of the compactor 400 will now be discussed. The user grips the
   secondary handle 428 whilst holding the primary handle 406. The user pushes the
   primary handle 406 down, towards the second end 322 of the dirt container. The
   user moves the primary handle 406 from the raised position shown in Figure 4a to
 5 the lowered position shown in Figure 4B. This moves the dirt compactor 400 from
   the stowed position shown in Figure 4A to the compacting position shown in Figure
   4B.
            As the primary handle 406 moves down, the dirt compression plate 414 urges
10 dirt between the dirt separator 312 and the wall 218 towards the second end 322.
   The dirt compression plate 414 squeezes the dirt between the compression plate 414
   and the second end 322. In the compacting position, the compression plate 414 (or
   700) is adjacent to an end 430 of the dirt separator 312. This means that the annular
   compression plate 414 (or 700) moves substantially along the entire length of the dirt
15 separator 312 and the resilient sweeper 422 sweeps all of the exterior surface 420 of
   the dirt separator 312.
            The user then releases the primary handle 406 which returns to the raised
   position and the dirt compression plate 414 (or 700) to the stowed position.       This
20 creates free space in the dirt container 210 and the user can continue to user the
   vacuum cleaner unit 102 without emptying the dirt container 210.
            Optionally the user can actuate the dirt compactor 400 with the door 324 in
   the open position. The door 324 is opened with the latch 326 as described above. In
25 this way the dirt compactor 400 is used to urge the dirt out of the dirt container 210
   when emptying.      In particular the annular dirt compression plate 414 is useful for
   removing debris that may become stuck between the exterior surface 420 of the dirt
   separator 312 and the internal surface of the wall 218. This means the user avoids
   having to user their fingers to remove bits of accumulated hair covered in dust and
30 the like from the dirt container 210 when emptying.
            Figures 5A and 5B also respectively show the dirt container 210 with the dirt
   compactor 400 in the stowed position and the compacting position. Figures 5A and
   5B show a perspective cross section of the dirt container 210.
35
                                            15

           As mentioned previously the aperture 310 is mounted in the wall 218 of the
   dirt container 210 between the dirt compression plate 414 (or 700) and the second
   end 322.     However when the dirt compactor 400 is moved into the compacting
   position, the dirt compaction plate 414 (or 700) moves past the aperture 310. This
 5 means that the aperture 310 is located between the dirt compaction plate 414 and
   the first end 320 when the dirt compactor 400 is in the compacting position.
   Accordingly it is undesirable for the motor fan assembly 300 to generate an airflow
   with dirt and debris entrained therein to be input when the dirt compactor 400 is in the
   dirt compacting position.     This is because the dirt and debris will accumulate
10 underneath the lid 320 and the dirt can contaminate the dirt compaction mechanism
   and require maintenance.
           The arrangement to prevent dirt and debris contaminating the dirt compactor
   400 will now be discussed in further detail with respect to Figures 6a and 6b. Figures
15 6a and 6b respectively show a close up perspective cross section of the dirt vacuum
   unit 102 with the dirt compactor 400 in the stowed position and the compacting
   position. The close up representations of the vacuum cleaner unit 102 are indicated
   by the dotted box in Figure 5a.
20          Figures 6a and 6b also show the dirt container 210 mounted in the housing
   200 of the vacuum cleaner unit 102.        The vacuum cleaner unit 102 comprises a
   detector switching mechanism 600 for selectively interrupting power to the motor fan
   assembly 300. The detector switching mechanism 600 is arranged to detect the
   presence of the dirt container 210 being mounted in the housing 200. The switching
25 mechanism 600 comprises an electrical switch 602 which is in electrical series
   connection with the electrical circuit comprising the ON/OFF switch 202, the motor
   fan assembly 300 and the battery 306.
           The detector switching mechanism 600 is configured to close the electrical
30 circuit and supply power to the motor fan assembly 300 when the moveable dirt
   compactor 400 is in the stowed position.
            Figure 6a shows the electrical switch 602 in the ON position such that power
   is supplied from the battery 306 to the motor fan assembly 300 when the main
35 ON/OFF switch 202 is in the ON position.
                                            16

           The electrical switch 602 is actuated by a projecting switching arm 604. The
   projecting switching arm 604 is mounted on the handle mounting element 408.
   Accordingly the projecting switching arm 604 moves up and down when the primary
 5 handle 406 and the handle mounting element 408 moves between the raised position
   and the lowered position.
           When the primary handle 406 is in the raised position, the projecting
   switching arm 604 projects up from the handle housing 404. The projecting switching
10 arm 604 can be seen in Figure 4a as well. When the dirt container 210 is mounted in
   the housing 200, the projecting switching arm 604 protrudes through a hole 606 in
   the housing.     The projecting arm engages and pivots a pivoting arm 608.         The
   pivoting arm 608 pivots and actuates the electrical switch 602 when the projecting
   arm 604 pushes against the pivoting arm 608.         In this way the pivoting arm 608
15 pivots between an engagement position and a disengagement position and actuates
   the electrical switch     602 accordingly.      The engagement       position and the
   disengagement position of the pivoting arm 608 are respectively shown in Figures 6a
   and 6b.
20          Figure 6b shows the primary handle 406 in the lowered position. The linkage
   416 and the handle mounting element 408 are also lowered and moved away from
   the pivoting arm 608 and the electrical switch 602.          Accordingly the projecting
   switching arm 604 is remote from the electrical switch 602 when the primary handle
   406 is in a lowered position. The electrical switch 602 is biased to the open position
25 and therefore the power supplied to the motor fan assembly 300 is interrupted when
   the primary handle 406 is moved to a lowered position.
            In some embodiments the electrical switch is a microswitch.           In other
   embodiments the electrical switch 602 is any suitable electrical element for
30 interrupting the electrical supply to the motor fan assembly 300. For example the
   electrical switch 602 can be a relay, transistor or the projecting switching arm 604
   can itself be an electrical connection of the switch. As can be seen from Figures 6A
   and 6B the switching mechanism is partly on the dirt container 210 and the housing
   200. In other embodiments, the switching mechanism is wholly comprised within the
35 dirt container 210.    In the instance where the switching mechanism is in the dirt
                                            17

   container 210, there are electrical connections between the dirt container 210 and
   the housing 200.
            Alternatively or additionally the detector switch can be other types of
   detectors such as an optical detector to optically detect the projecting switching arm
 5 604, or a moving magnet on the projecting switching arm 604 and a hall sensor in the
   housing 200, a reed switch in the housing 200 and a moving magnet on the
   projecting switching arm 604 or any other electrical sensor to detect movement of the
   dirt compactor. In other embodiments the detector switch 602 is a sensor part of an
   electronic detection circuit comprising a microprocessor.         In this instance the
10 microprocessor controls the power supply to the motor fan assembly in dependence
   on the sensor output.
            The arrangement shown in Figures 6A and 6B means that the motor fan
   assembly is not in operation when the dirt compactor 400 is in the compacting
15 position.    Furthermore the motor fan assembly 300 is not operable when the dirt
   container 210 is removed from the housing 200. This means that an airflow cannot
   be sucked into the motor fan assembly without first passing through the dirt separator
   312.
20          As mentioned above, in some scenarios, some dirt may become trapped in
   the dirt container 210 between the first end 320 and the dirt compactor 400. In such
   cases, a build-up of dirt may prevent the dirt compactor 400 from returning to the
   stowed position because the top surface of the dirt compactor abuts against the dirt
   build-up. This, in turn, may prevent switching arm 604 from protruding through hole
25 606 in the housing and engaging the pivoting arm 608, which actuates the electrical
   switch 602. Thus, the build-up of dirt above the dirt compactor 400 could lead to an
   unintended interruption to the electrical supply to the motor fan assembly 300. One
   way of solving this problem is to provide a dust compactor that allows dirt located on
   one side of the compactor to pass through to the other side of the dirt compactor.
30 Figure 7a shows a top view of an example of such a dirt compactor and figure 7b
   shows a bottom view of the dirt compactor. As mentioned above, the dirt compactor
   has open sections 703 through which dirt can pass.          Other suitably shaped dirt
   compactors that allow dirt to pass through may be provided such as an annular or
   circular dirt compactor with a plurality of holes in them to allow dirt to pass through.
                                            18

   In the upright type vacuum cleaner described herein, the dirt can move under gravity
   and, when in use, under the pull of the vacuum from above the dirt compactor,
   through the open sections and below the dirt compactor.
 5           As shown in figure 7a, the top surface 704 of the dirt compactor has a greater
   surface area than the bottom surface 705 of the dirt compactor. This helps reduce
   the contact area of the dirt compactor with the first end 320 of the inside of the dirt
   container 210 and thus helps reduce the amount of dirt that can be trapped between
   them.      As shown in figure 7a, one optional way of achieving the surface area
10 difference is by providing sloping surfaces or sections 706 between the top surface
   704 and the bottom surface 705. The sloping surface 706 also helps the dirt to roll or
   fall off the dirt compactor.
             During operation, as dirt fills the dirt container 210, the dirt tends to bind to
15 itself. When compacting, the annular section 701 and protruding sections 702 are
   able to push down the dirt directly below those sections and also pull down significant
   dirt directly below the open sections 703 as that dirt has bound to the dirt that is
   being pushed down. Thus, even with the open sections 703, the dirt compactor is
   able to compact and move the majority of dirt towards end 322.

             In another embodiment two or more embodiments are combined. Features of
   one embodiment can be combined with features of other embodiments.
             Embodiments of the present invention have been discussed with particular
25 reference to the examples illustrated. For example in one embodiment the primary
   handle is optional and the actuation of the dirt compactor is operated with other
   mechanism. A lever (not shown) is provided that is pivotally mounted on the dirt
   container 210 and pivotally movement of the lever translates into movement of the
   dirt compactor 400.       Alternatively the dirt compactor 400 is actuated with an
30 motorised gear mechanism (not shown) which can be automated or the user can
   selectively actuate.    For example the dirt compactor 400 is threaded on a rotating
   central rod (not shown) powered by the motorised gear mechanism and the dirt
   compression plate 414 or 700 travels up and down the rotating central rod as the rod
   rotates.
