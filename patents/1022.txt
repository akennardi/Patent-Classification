   COMPOSITIONS COMPRISING CHIMERIC OSPA MOLECULES AND
                             METHODS OF USE THEREOF
                   CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPPLICATIONS
  [0001]      This application claims the benefit of priority to U.S. Provisional Application
  No. 61/676,668, filed July 27, 2012 which is incorporated herein by reference in its
  entirety.
                                 FIELD OF THE INVENTION
 [0002]       The invention generally relates to chimeric OspA polypeptides, nucleic
 acids encoding the polypeptides, compositions comprising these molecules, and
 methods of use thereof.
                            BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
 [0003]      Lyme disease is a tick-borne disease caused by Borrelia burgdorferi sensu
 lato (si/.). The disease is typically characterized by the development of an
 expanding red rash at the site of the tick bite that may be followed by systemic
 complications including meningitis, carditis or arthritis. Almost all cases of Lyme
 disease are caused by one of three genospecies, Borreliaafzeli, Borreliagarinii and
 Borrelia burgdorteri sensu stricto (s.s.). In Europe, all three species which infect
 humans are found. However, in North America only a single species, Borrelia
 burgdorferi sensu stricto, is found. Borrelia burgdorferi is a species of Gram
 negative bacteria of the spirochete class of the genus Borrelia. Antibiotic treatment
of Lyme disease is usually effective but some patients develop a chronic disabling
form of the disease involving joints or nervous system, which does not substantially
improve even after parenteral antibiotic therapy, thus highlighting the need for a
vaccine for high-risk populations.
[00041       Outer surface protein A (OspA) is a 31 kDa antigen, expressed by Borrelia
burgdorferi s.. species present in the midgut of Ixodes ticks. OspA has proven to be
efficacious in preventing Lyme disease in North America (Steere et al., N. Eng. J.
Med. 339: 209-15,1998; Sigal et al., N. Eng. J. Med. 339:216-22, 1998; erratum in:
N. EngL J. Med. 339:571, 1998). The amino terminus of fully processed OspA is a
                                              1caX

   cysteine residue that is post-translationally modified with three fatty-acyl chains that
   anchor the protein to the outer surface of the bacterial membrane (Bouchon et al.,
   Anal. Biochem. 246: 52-61, 1997). Lipidation of OspA is reported to stabilize the
   molecule (Luft, personal communication) and is essential for protection in the
   absence of a strong adjuvant (Erdile et al., Infect Immun. 61: 81-90, 1993). A
   soluble, recombinant form of the protein lacking the amino-terminal lipid membrane
   anchor was co-crystallized with the Fab fragment of an agglutinating mouse
   monoclonal antibody to determine the structure of OspA, which was shown to
  comprise 21 anti-parallel g-strands followed by a single a-helix (Li et al., Proc. Natl.
  Acad. Sci. U.S.A_ 94:3584-9, 1997).
  [0005]     A monovalent OspA-based vaccine (LYMErix@) was marketed in the USA
  for the prevention of Lyme disease. However, in Europe heterogeneity in OspA
  sequences across the three genospecies precludes broad protection with a vaccine
  based on OspA from a single strain (Gern et al., Vaccine 15:1551-7, 1997). Seven
  principal OspA serotypes have been recognized among European isolates
  (designated serotypes 1 to 7, Wilske et al., J. Clin. Microbio. 31:340-50, 1993).
 OspA serotypes correlate with species; serotype 1 corresponds to B. burgdorferi s.s,
 serotype 2 corresponds to B. afzelfi and serotypes 3 to 7 correspond to B. garinii.
 [00061      Protective immunity acquired through immunization with OspA is unusual
 since the interaction between the host's immune response and the pathogen does
 not take place in the host, but in the mid-gut of the tick vector. In the case of Lyme
 disease, a tick acts as a vector or carrier for the transmission of Lyme disease from
 animals to humans. OspA specific antibody acquired during feeding by an infected
tick prevents transmission of B. burgdorferi s. to the immunized mammalian host
 (de Silva et al., J. Exp. Med. 183: 271-5, 1996). Protection is antibody-mediated and
is mainly affected through bactericidal antibody although an antibody that blocks
attachment of the spirochete to a receptor on the lining of the tick gut epithelium may
also be efficacious (Pal et al., J. Immunol 166: 7398-403, 2001).
[0007]      Rational development of effective OspA vaccines requires identification of
the protective epitopes such as that defined by the protective monoclonal antibody
LA-2 (Golde et al., Infect. Immun. 65: 882-9, 1997). X-ray crystallography and NMR
analysis have been used to identify immunologically important hypervariable
domains in OspA and have mapped the LA-2 epitope to amino acids 203-257 (Ding
                                              2

   et al., J. Moi Biol 302: 1153-64, 2000; Luft et al. J Infect Dis. 185 (Suppl 1): S46
   51,2002).
   [0008]      There is a need in the art for the development of an OspA vaccine that can
   provide broad protection against a variety of species of Borrelia that are present in
  the United States, Europe, and elsewhere. The following disclosure describes the
  specifics of such a vaccine.

                       DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
   [0069]     The invention provides chimeric OspA molecules that are useful as
   antigens that can be delivered as an immunogenic composition or vaccine
  composition for Lyme disease or a Borrelia infection. Before any embodiments of
  the invention are explained in detail, it is to be understood that the invention is not
  limited in its application to the details of construction and the arrangement of
  components set forth in the following description or illustrated in the figures and
  examples. The section headings used herein are for organizational purposes only
  and are not to be construed as limiting the subject matter described. All references
  cited in this application are expressly incorporated by reference herein.
  [0070]     The invention embraces other embodiments and is practiced or carried out
 in various ways. Also, it is to be understood that the phraseology and terminology
 used herein is for the purpose of description and should not be regarded as limiting.
 The terms "including," "comprising," or "having" and variations thereof are meant to
 encompass the items listed thereafter and equivalents thereof as well as additional
 items.
 [0071]      Embodiments of the invention are exemplified in the design and synthesis
 of three chimeric OspA coding sequences that encode three distinct lipidated OspA
 molecules, all of which share some common features. Each chimeric coding
 sequence represents two OspA serotypes and the chimeric coding sequences were
designed to encode stable chimeric OspA molecules that are safe and highly
immunogenic, and afford a subject protection against infection with B. burgdorferi
sensu lato (s..).
[0072]      In one aspect, the chimeric OspA molecules comprise the proximal portion
from one OspA serotype, together with the distal portion from another OspA serotype
while retaining the protective properties of both of the parent polypeptides. The
chimeric OspA nucleic acid molecules were expressed in Escherichia coli (E coi) to
provide antigens which could be formulated as a combination vaccine to provide
protection against all six prevalent serotypes (serotypes 1-6) associated with Lyme
disease or Borrelia infection in Europe and against the single OspA serotype
associated with Lyme disease or Borrelia infection in North America. Because a
                                               17

  vaccine comprising serotypes 1-6 provides protection against B. afzelii, B. garini, B.
  bavariensis, and B. burgdorferi, the vaccine is designed for global use.
  [0073)     The invention also includes the preparation of a second set of chimeric
  OspA coding sequences which is, in one aspect, derived from the first set of three
  genes, by removing nucleic acid sequences encoding a leader sequence needed to
  produce a lipidated OspA molecule. The two sets of constructs (giving rise to
  lipidated and non-lipidated polypeptides) were needed to evaluate their ease of
  production in the fermentor (biomass, stability, product yields etc.), to assess how
  readily different types of antigen can be purified and to compare their biological
  characteristics (safety profile and protective potency).
 [0074]      The invention includes immunogenic compositions comprising the chimeric
 OspA molecules of the invention. The invention likewise includes vaccines and
 vaccine kits comprising such OspA molecules, processes for making the
 immunogenic compositions and vaccines and the use of the immunogenic
 compositions and vaccines in human and veterinary medical therapy and prevention.
 The invention further includes methods of immunizing against Lyme disease or
 Borrelia infection using the OspA compositions described herein and the use of the
 OspA compositions in the manufacture of a medicament for the prevention of Lyme
disease or Borrelia infection.

to deoxyribonucleotides or ribonucleotides and polymers thereof in either single- or
double-stranded form. The term encompasses nucleic acids containing known
nucleotide analogs or modified backbone residues or linkages, which are synthetic,
naturally occurring, and non-naturally occurring, which have similar binding
properties as the reference nucleic acid, and which are metabolized in a manner
similar to the reference nucleotides. Examples of such analogs include, without
limitation, phosphorothioates, phosphoramidates, methyl phosphonates, chiral
methyl phosphonates, 2-0-methyl ribonucleotides, peptide-nucleic acids (PNAs).
                                              20

    The terms encompass molecules formed from any of the known base analogs of
    DNA and RNA such as, but not limited to 4-acetylcytosine, 8-hydroxy-N6
    methyladenine, aziridinyl-cytosine, pseudoisocytosine, 5-(carboxyhydroxylmethyl)
    uracil, 5-fluorouracil, 5-bromouracil, 5-carboxymethylaminomethyl-2-thiouracil, 5
    carboxy-methylaminomethyluracil, dihydrouracil, inosine, N6-iso-pentenyladenine, 1
    methyladenine, 1-methylpseudouracil, 1-methylguanine, 1-methylinosine, 2,2

   methyluracil, N-uracil-5-oxyacetic acid methylester, uracil-5-oxyacetic acid,
   pseudouracil, queosine, 2-thiocytosine, and 2,6-diaminopurine.
   [0081]      Unless otherwise indicated, a particular nucleic acid sequence also
   implicitly encompasses conservatively modified variants thereof (e.g., degenerate
  codon substitutions) and complementary sequences, as well as the sequence
  explicitly indicated. Specifically, degenerate codon substitutions, in some aspects,
  are achieved by generating sequences in which the third position of one or more
  selected (or all) codons is substituted with mixed-base and/or deoxyinosine residues
  (Batzer et al., Nucleic Acid Res. 19:5081 (1991); Ohtsuka et al., J. Biol Chem.
 260:2605-2608 (1985); Rossolini et al., Mol. Cell Probes 8:91-98 (1994)). The term
 nucleic acid is used interchangeably with gene, cDNA, mRNA, oligonucleotide, and
 polynucleotide.
 [0082]       The terms "polypeptide," "peptide" and "protein" are used interchangeably
 herein to refer to a polymer of amino acid residues linked via peptide bonds. The
terms apply to amino acid polymers in which one or more amino acid residue is an
artificial chemical mimetic of a corresponding naturally occurring amino acid, as well
as to naturally occurring amino acid polymers and non-naturally occurring amino acid
polymers. The term "protein" typically refers to large polypeptides. The term
"peptide" typically refers to short polypeptides. Synthetic polypeptides can be
synthesized, for example, using an automated polypeptide synthesizer.
                                              21

    [0083]     The term "Osp A molecule" or "chimeric OspA molecule" refers, in one
    aspect, to an "OspA nucleic acid" comprising the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID
    NO: 1 (IipB sOspA 1/2251), SEQ ID NO: 3 (lipB sOspA 6/4), SEQ ID NO: 5 (lipB
    sOspA 5/3), SEQ ID NO: 7 (sOspA 1/2251), SEQ ID NO: 9 (sOspA 6/4), SEQ ID NO:
    11 (sOspA 5/3), SEQ ID NO: 168 (orig sOspA 1/2), SEQ ID NO: 170 (orig sOspA
    6/4), or SEQ ID NO: 172 (orig sOspA 5/3), or, in another aspect to an "OspA
    polypeptide" comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2 (IipB sOspA
    1/2251), SEQ ID NO; 4 (IipB sOspA 6/4), SEQ ID NO: 6 (lipB sOspA 5/3), SEQ ID
    NO: 8 (sOspA 1/2251), SEQ ID NO: 10 (sOspA 6/4), SEQ ID NO: 12 (sOspA 5/3),
   SEQ ID NO: 169 (orig sOspA 1/2), SEQ ID NO: 171 (orig sOspA 6/4), or SEQ ID
   NO: 173 (orig sOspA 5/3).
   [0084]      The term "lipB sOspA molecule" refers, in one aspect, to an "OspA nucleic
   acid" comprising the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 (lipB sOspA 1/2251), SEQ
   ID NO: 3 (lipB sOspA 6/4), or SEQ ID NO: 5 (lipB sOspA 5/3) or, in another aspect to
  an "OspA polypeptide" comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2 (lipB
  sOspA 1/2251), SEQ ID NO: 4 (lipB sOspA 6/4), or SEQ ID NO: 6 (lipB sOspA 5/3).
  The nucleic acid sequences of SEQ ID NOS: 7, 9, and 11 lack the nucleic acid
  sequence encoding the lipB leader sequence (MRLLIGFALALALIG (SEQ ID NO:
  13). In addition, the nucleic acid sequences of SEQ ID NOS: 7, 9, and 11 encode a
  methionine residue at the amino terminus of SEQ ID NOS: 8, 10, and 12 in place of
  the cysteine residue present at the carboxy terminus of the lipB leader sequence in
  SEQ ID NOS: 2, 4, and 6.
 [0085]       The term "orig sOspA molecule" or "original sOspA molecule" refers, in one
 aspect, to an "OspA nucleic acid" comprising the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID
 NO: 168 (orig sOspA 1/2), SEQ ID NO: 170 (orig sOspA 6/4), or SEQ ID NO: 172
 (orig sOspA 5/3) or, in another aspect to an "OspA polypeptide" comprising the
 amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 169 (orig sOspA 1/2), SEQ ID NO: 171 (orig
sOspA 6/4), or SEQ ID NO: 173 (orig sOspA 5/3). These "original" molecules are
chimeric constructs without mutations and without codon optimization.
[0086]       The invention includes "lipidated OspA" and "non-lipidated OspA" chimeric
molecules. In various aspects, lipidation confers adjuvant properties on OspA. In
some aspects of the invention, the lipidated OspA molecules comprise an OspB
leader sequence. In some aspects of the invention, the OspB leader sequence
                                             22

   comprises amino acids MRLLIGFALALALIG (SEQ ID NO: 13). In other aspects, the
   OspB leader sequence comprises other amino acids.
   [0087]     The terms "identical" or percent "identity" as known in the art refers to a
   relationship between the sequences of two or more polypeptide molecules or two or
   more nucleic acid molecules, as determined by comparing the sequences. In the art,
   "identity" also means the degree of sequence relatedness between nucleic acid
   molecules or polypeptides, as the case may be, as determined by the match
  between strings of two or more nucleotide or two or more amino acid sequences.
  "Identity" measures the percent of identical matches between the smaller of two or
  more sequences with gap alignments (if any) addressed by a particular mathematical
  model or computer program (i.e., "algorithms"). "Substantial identity" refers to
  sequences with at least about 70%, about 71 %, about 72%, about 73%, about 74%,
  about 75%, about 76%, about 77%, about 78%, about 79%, about 80%, about 81%,
  about 82%, about 83%, about 84%, about 85%, about 86%, about 87%, about 88%,
  about 89%, about 90%, about 91 %, about 92%, about 93%, about 94%, about 95%,
  about 96%, about 97%, about 98%, or about 99% sequence identity over a specified
  sequence. In some aspects, the identity exists over a region that is at least about
  50-100 amino acids or nucleotides in length. In other aspects, the identity exists
  over a region that is at least about 100-200 amino acids or nucleotides in length. In
  other aspects, the identity exists over a region that is at least about 200-500 amino
  acids or nucleotides in length. In certain aspects, percent sequence identity is
 determined using a computer program selected from the group consisting of GAP,
 BLASTP, BLASTN, FASTA, BLASTA, BLASTX, BestFit and the Smith-Waterman
 algorithm
 [0088]      It also is specifically understood that any numerical value recited herein
 includes all values from the lower value to the upper value, i.e., all possible
 combinations of numerical values between the lowest value and the highest value
 enumerated are to be considered to be expressly stated in this application. For
example, if a concentration range is stated as about 1% to 50%, it is intended that
values such as 2% to 40%, 10% to 30%, or 1% to 3%, etc., are expressly
enumerated in this specification. The values listed above are only examples of what
is specifically intended.
                                               23

    [0089]     Ranges, in various aspects, are expressed herein as from "about" or
    "approximately" one particular value and/or to "about" or "approximately" another
    particular value. When values are expressed as approximations, by use of the
   antecedent "about," it will be understood that some amount of variation is included in
   the range.
   [0090]     The term "similarity" is a related concept but, in contrast to "identity", refers
   to a measure of similarity which includes both identical matches and conservative
   substitution matches. If two polypeptide sequences have, for example, 10/20
   identical amino acids, and the remainder are all non-conservative substitutions, then
   the percent identity and similarity would both be 50%. If, in the same example, there
   are five more positions where there are conservative substitutions, then the percent
   identity remains 50%, but the percent similarity would be 75% (15/20). Therefore, in
  cases where there are conservative substitutions, the degree of percent similarity
  between two polypeptides will be higher than the percent identity between those two
  polypeptides.
  [0091J      The term "isolated nucleic acid molecule" refers to a nucleic acid molecule
  of the invention that (1) has been separated to any degree from proteins, lipids,
  carbohydrates or other materials with which it is naturally found when total DNA is
  isolated from the source cells, (2) is not linked to all or a portion of a polynucleotide
 to which the "isolated nucleic acid molecule" is linked in nature, (3) is operably linked
 to a polynucleotide which it is not linked to in nature, or (4) does not occur in nature
 as part of a larger polynucleotide sequence. Substantially free as used herein
 indicates that the nucleic acid molecule is free from any other contaminating nucleic
 acid molecule(s) or other contaminants that are found in its natural environment that
 would interfere with its use in polypeptide production or its therapeutic, diagnostic,
 prophylactic or research use.
 [0092]      The term "isolated polypeptide" refers to a polypeptide of the present
 invention that (1) has been separated to any degree from polynucleotides, lipids,
carbohydrates or other materials with which it is naturally found when isolated from
the source cell, (2) is not linked (by covalent or noncovalent interaction) to all or a
portion of a polypeptide to which the "isolated polypeptide" is linked in nature, (3)is
operably linked (by covalent or noncovalent interaction) to a polypeptide with which it
is not linked in nature, or (4) does not occur in nature. In one aspect, the isolated
                                               24

   polypeptide is substantially free from any other contaminating polypeptides or other
  contaminants that are found in its natural environment that would interfere with its
  therapeutic, diagnostic, prophylactic or research use.
  [0093]     As used herein a "fragment" of a polypeptide refers to any portion of the
  polypeptide smaller than the full-length polypeptide or protein expression product.
  Fragments are typically deletion analogs of the full-length polypeptide wherein one or
  more amino acid residues have been removed from the amino terminus and/or the
  carboxy terminus of the full-length polypeptide. Accordingly, "fragments" are a
  subset of deletion analogs described below.
  [0094]     As used herein an "analog" refers to a polypeptide substantially similar in
 structure and having the same biological activity, albeit in certain instances to a
 differing degree, to a naturally-occurring molecule. Analogs differ in the composition
 of their amino acid sequences compared to the naturally-occurring polypeptide from
 which the analog is derived, based on one or more mutations involving (i) deletion of
 one or more amino acid residues at one or more termini of the polypeptide (including
 fragments as described above) and/or one or more internal regions of the naturally
 occurring polypeptide sequence, (ii) insertion or addition of one or more amino acids
 at one or more termini (typically an "addition" analog) of the polypeptide and/or one
or more internal regions (typically an "insertion" analog) of the naturally-occurring
polypeptide sequence or (iii) substitution of one or more amino acids for other amino
acids in the naturally-occurring polypeptide sequence. Substitutions are
conservative or non-conservative based on the physico-chemical or functional
relatedness of the amino acid that is being replaced and the amino acid replacing it.
[0095]      "Conservatively modified analogs" applies to both amino acid and nucleic
acid sequences. With respect to particular nucleic acid sequences, conservatively
modified nucleic acids refers to those nucleic acids which encode identical or
essentially identical amino acid sequences, or where the nucleic acid does not
encode an amino acid sequence, to essentially identical sequences. Because of the
degeneracy of the genetic code, a large number of functionally identical nucleic acids
encode any given protein. For instance, the codons GCA, GCC, GCG and GCU all
encode the amino acid alanine. Thus, at every position where an alanine is specified
by a codon, the codon can be altered to any of the corresponding codons described
without altering the encoded polypeptide. Such nucleic acid variations are "silent
                                            25

   variations," which are one species of conservatively modified analogs. Every nucleic
   acid sequence herein which encodes a polypeptide also describes every possible
   silent variation of the nucleic acid. One of skill will recognize that each codon in a
   nucleic acid (except AUG, which is ordinarily the only codon for methionine, and
   TGG, which is ordinarily the only codon for tryptophan) can be modified to yield a
   functionally identical molecule. Accordingly, each silent variation of a nucleic acid
  which encodes a polypeptide is implicit in each described sequence.
  [0096]      As to amino acid sequences, one of skill will recognize that individual
  substitutions, insertions, deletions, additions, or truncations to a nucleic acid,
  peptide, polypeptide, or protein sequence which alters, adds or deletes a single
  amino acid or a small percentage of amino acids in the encoded sequence is a
  "conservatively modified analog" where the alteration results in the substitution of an
  amino acid with a chemically similar amino acid. Conservative substitution tables
  providing functionally similar amino acids are well known in the art. Such
  conservatively modified variants are in addition to and do not exclude polymorphic
 variants, interspecies homologs, and alleles of the invention.
 [0097]      The following eight groups each contain amino acids that are conservative
 substitutions for one another:
 1)       Alanine (A), Glycine (G);
 2)       Aspartic acid (D), Glutamic acid (E);
 3)      Asparagine (N), Glutamine (Q);
 4)      Arginine (R), Lysine (K);
 5)      Isoleucine (1), Leucine (L), Methionine (M), Valine (V);
6)       Phenylalanine (F), Tyrosine (Y), Tryptophan (W);
7)       Serine (S), Threonine (T); and
8)       Cysteine (C), Methionine (M) (see, e.g., Creighton, Proteins (1984)).
[0098]      As used herein a "variant" refers to a polypeptide, protein or analog thereof
that comprises at least one amino acid substitution, deletion, insertion, or
modification, provided that the variant retains the biological activity of the native
polypeptide.
                                             26

    [0099]     As used herein an "allelic variant" refers to any of two or more polymorphic
    forms of a gene occupying the same genetic locus. Allelic variations arise naturally
    through mutation and, in some aspects, result in phenotypic polymorphism within
    populations. In certain aspects, gene mutations are silent (no change in the
    encoded polypeptide) or, in other aspects, encode polypeptides having altered
    amino acid sequences. "Allelic variants" also refer to cDNAs derived from mRNA
   transcripts of genetic allelic variants, as well as the proteins encoded by them.
   [00100]      The term "derivative" refers to polypeptides that are covalently modified
   by conjugation to therapeutic or diagnostic agents, labeling (e.g., with radionuclides
   or various enzymes), covalent polymer attachment such as pegylation (derivatization
   with polyethylene glycol) and insertion or substitution by chemical synthesis of non
   natural amino acids. In some aspects, derivatives are modified to comprise
   additional chemical moieties not normally a part of the molecule. Such moieties, in
   various aspects, modulate the molecule's solubility, absorption, and/or biological
   half-life. The moieties, in various other aspects, alternatively decrease the toxicity of
  the molecule and eliminate or attenuate any undesirable side effect of the molecule,
  etc. Moieties capable of mediating such effects are disclosed in Remington's
  Pharmaceutical Sciences (1980). Procedure for coupling such moieties to a
  molecule are well known in the art. For example, in some aspects, an OspA
  derivative is an OspA molecule having a chemical modification which confers a
  longer half-life in vivo to the protein. In one embodiment, the polypeptides are
  modified by addition of a water soluble polymer known in the art. In a related
 embodiment, polypeptides are modified by glycosylation, PEGylation, and/or
 polysialylation.
 [00101]       The term "recombinant" when used with reference, e.g., to a cell, or
 nucleic acid, protein, or vector, indicates that the cell, nucleic acid, protein or vector,
 has been modified by the introduction of a heterologous nucleic acid or protein or the
alteration of a native nucleic acid or protein, or that the cell is derived from a cell so
modified. Thus, for example, recombinant cells express genes that are not found
within the native (non-recombinant) form of the cell or express native genes that are
otherwise abnormally expressed, underexpressed or not expressed at all.
[00102]       As used herein "selectable marker" refers to a gene encoding an enzyme
or other protein that confers upon the cell or organism in which it is expressed an
                                               27

   identifiable phenotypic change such as resistance to a drug, antibiotic or other agent,
   such that expression or activity of the marker is selected for (for example, but without
   limitation, a positive marker, such as the neo gene) or against (for example, and
  without limitation, a negative marker, such as the diphtheria gene). A "heterologous
  selectable marker" refers to a selectable marker gene that has been inserted into the
  genome of an animal in which it would not normally be found.
  [00103]       Examples of selectable markers include, but are not limited to, an
  antibiotic resistance gene such as neomycin (neo), puromycin (Puro), diphtheria
  toxin, phosphotransferase, hygromycin phosphotransferase, xanthineguanine
  phosphoribosyl transferase, the Herpes simplex virus type 1 thymidine kinase,
  adenine phosphoribosyltransferase and hypoxanthine phosphonbosyltransferase.
  The worker of ordinary skill in the art will understand any selectable marker known in
 the art is useful in the methods described herein.
  [00104]      The term "heterologous" when used with reference to portions of a nucleic
 acid indicates that the nucleic acid comprises two or more subsequences that are
 not found in the same relationship to each other in nature. For instance, the nucleic
 acid is typically recombinantly produced, having two or more sequences from
 unrelated genes arranged to make a new functional nucleic acid, e.g., a promoter
 from one source and a coding region from another source. Similarly, a heterologous
 protein indicates that the protein comprises two or more subsequences that are not
 found in the same relationship to each other in nature (e.g., a fusion protein).
 [00105]       As used herein, the term "homologous" refers to the relationship between
 proteins that possess a "common evolutionary origin," including proteins from
superfamilies (e.g., the immunoglobulin superfamily) and homologous proteins from
different species (e.g., myosin light chain, etc.) (Reeck et al., Cell 50:667, 1987).
Such proteins (and their encoding genes) have sequence homology, as reflected by
their sequence similarity, whether in terms of percent similarity or the presence of
specific residues or motifs at conserved positions.
[00106]        Optimal alignment of sequences for comparison is conducted, for
example and without limitation, by the local homology algorithm of Smith et al., Adv.
Apple. Math. 2:482, 1981; by the homology alignment algorithm of Needleman et al.,
J Mol Biol. 48:443, 1970; by the search for similarity method of Pearson et al., Proc.
                                               28

    Nad. Acad. Sci USA 85:2444, 1988; by computerized implementations of these
   algorithms (GAP, BESTFIT, FASTA, and TFASTA in the Wisconsin Genetics
   Software Package, Genetics Computer Group, 575 Science Dr., Madison, WI), or by
   visual inspection (see generally Ausubel et al., supra). Another example of algorithm
   that is suitable for determining percent sequence identity and sequence similarity is
   the BLAST algorithm, which is described in Altschul et al., J. MoL BioL 215:403-410,
   1990. Software for performing BLAST analyses is publicly available through the
   National Center for Biotechnology Information. In addition to calculating percent
   sequence identity, the BLAST algorithm also performs a statistical analysis of the
  similarity between two sequences (see, e.g., Karlin et al., Proc. NatL Acad. Sci. USA
  90:5873-5787, 1993).
  [00107]      The term "vector" is used to refer to any molecule (e.g., nucleic acid,
  plasmid or virus) used to transfer coding information to a host cell.
  [00108]      A "cloning vector" is a small piece of DNA into which a foreign DNA
  fragment can be inserted. The insertion of the fragment into the cloning vector is
  carried out by treating the vehicle and the foreign DNA with the same restriction
  enzyme, then ligating the fragments together. There are many types of cloning
  vectors and all types of cloning vectors are used in the invention. Genetically
 engineered plasmids and bacteriophages (such as phage A)are perhaps most
 commonly used for this purpose. Other types of cloning vectors include bacterial
 artificial chromosomes (BACs) and yeast artificial chromosomes (YACs).
 [00109]       An "expression vector" is a nucleic acid construct, generated
 recombinantly or synthetically, with a series of specified nucleic acid elements that
 permit transcription of a particular nucleic acid in a host cell. The expression vector
 can be part of a plasmid, virus, or nucleic acid fragment. In certain aspects, the
expression vector includes a nucleic acid to be transcribed operably linked to a
promoter.
[00110]       The term "coding sequence" is defined herein as a nucleic acid sequence
that is transcribed into mRNA, which is translated into a polypeptide when placed
under the control of the appropriate control sequences. The boundaries of the
coding sequence are generally determined by the ATG start codon, which is
normally the start of the open reading frame at the 5' end of the mRNA and a
                                              29

  transcription terminator sequence located just downstream of the open reading
  frame at the 3'end of the mRNA. A coding sequence can include, but is not limited
  to, genomic DNA, cDNA, semisynthetic, synthetic, and recombinant nucleic acid
  sequences. In one aspect, a promoter DNA sequence is defined by being the DNA
  sequence located upstream of a coding sequence associated thereto and by being
  capable of controlling the expression of this coding sequence.
  [00111]     A "promoter" is defined as an array of nucleic acid control sequences that
  direct transcription of a nucleic acid. As used herein, a promoter includes necessary
  nucleic acid sequences near the start site of transcription, such as, in the case of a
  polymerase If type promoter, a TATA element. A promoter also optionally includes
 distal enhancer or repressor elements, which can be located as much as several
 thousand base pairs from the start site of transcription. A "constitutive" promoter is a
 promoter that is active under most environmental and developmental conditions. An
 "inducible" promoter is a promoter that is active under environmental or
 developmental regulation.
 [00112]      The term "operably linked" refers to a functional linkage between a nucleic
 acid expression control sequence (such as a promoter, or array of transcription
 factor binding sites) and a second nucleic acid sequence, wherein the expression
 control sequence directs transcription of the nucleic acid corresponding to the
 second sequence.
 [00113]     The term "transduction" is used to refer to the transfer of nucleic acids
from one bacterium to another, usually by a phage. "Transduction" also refers to the
acquisition and transfer of eukaryotic cellular sequences by retroviruses.
[00114]      The term "transfection" is used to refer to the uptake of foreign or
exogenous DNA by a cell, and a cell has been "transfected" when the exogenous
DNA has been introduced inside the cell membrane. A number of transfection
techniques are well known in the art and are disclosed herein. See, for example,
Graham et al., Virology, 52:456 (1973); Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning, a
Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories, New York, (1989); Davis et al.,
Basic Methods in Molecular Biology, Elsevier, (1986); and Chu et al., Gene, 13:197
(1981). Such techniques can be used to introduce one or more exogenous DNA
moieties into suitable host cells.
                                             30

    [00115]     The term "transformation" as used herein refers to a change in a cells
    genetic characteristics, and a cell has been transformed when it has been modified
   to contain new DNA. For example, a cell is transformed where it is genetically
   modified from its native state. Following transfection or transduction, the
   transforming DNA may recombine with that of the cell by physically integrating into a
   chromosome of the cell. In some instances, the DNA is maintained transiently as an
   episomal element without being replicated, or it replicates independently as a
   plasmid. A cell is considered to have been stably transformed when the DNA is
   replicated with the division of the cell.
  [00116]      The term endogenouss" refers to a polypeptide or polynucleotide or other
  compound that is expressed naturally in the host organism, or originates within a
  cell, tissue or organism. "Exogenous" refers to a polypeptide, polynucleotide or other
  compound that originates outside a cell, tissue or organism.
  [00117]      The term "agent" or "compound" describes any molecule, e.g. protein or
 pharmaceutical, with the capability of affecting a biological parameter in the
 invention.
 [00118]      A "control," as used herein, can refer to an active, positive, negative or
 vehicle control. As will be understood by those of skill in the art, controls are used to
 establish the relevance of experimental results, and provide a comparison for the
 condition being tested.
 [00119]      The term "reduces the severity," when referring to a symptom of Lyme or
 Lyme disease, means that the symptom has delayed onset, reduced severity, or
 causes less damage to the subject. Generally, severity of a symptom is compared to
a control, e.g., that does not receive an active prophylactic or therapeutic
composition. In that case, a composition can be said to reduce the severity of a
symptom of Lyme if the symptom is reduced by 10%, 25%, 30%, 50%, 80%, or
100% (i.e., essentially eliminated), as compared to the control level of the symptom.
[00120]       The term "antigen" refers to a molecule or a portion of a molecule capable
of being bound by a selective binding agent, such as an antibody, and additionally
capable of being used in a subject to produce antibodies capable of binding to an
epitope of each antigen. An antigen, in various aspects, has one or more epitopes.
                                             31

     [00121]     The term "antibody" refers to a molecule or molecules having specificity
    for an OspA polypeptide. As used herein the terms, "specific," "specificity," and
    "specifically binds" refer to the ability of the antibody to bind to OspA polypeptides
    and not to bind to non-OspA polypeptides. In certain aspects, the antibody is a
    'neutralizing antibody," wherein the antibody reacts with an infectious agent and
    destroys or inhibits its infectiveness or virulence. The invention includes
    immunogenic compositions comprising antibodies that "neutralize" Borrelia.
    [00122]     The terms "pharmaceutically acceptable carrier" or "physiologically
   acceptable carrier" as used herein refer to one or more formulation materials suitable
   for accomplishing or enhancing the delivery of the OspA polypeptide, OspA nucleic
   acid molecule or OspA antibody as a pharmaceutical composition.
   [00123]      The term "stabilizer" refers to a substance or vaccine excipient which
   protects the immunogenic composition of the vaccine from adverse conditions, such
   as those which occur during heating or freezing, and/or prolongs the stability or
  shelf-life of the immunogenic composition in a stable and immunogenic condition or
  state. Examples of stabilizers include, but are not limited to, sugars, such as
  sucrose, lactose and mannose; sugar alcohols, such as manitol; amino acids, such
  as glycine or glutamic acid; and proteins, such as human serum albumin or gelatin.
  [00124]       The term "antimicrobial preservative" refers to any substance which is
  added to the immunogenic composition or vaccine that inhibits the growth of
  microorganisms that may be introduced upon repeated puncture of multidose vials,
 should such containers be used. Examples of antimicrobial preservatives include,
 but are not limited to, substances such as thimerosal, 2-phenoxyethanol,
 benzethonium chloride, and phenol.
 [00125]       The term "immunogenic composition" refers to a composition comprising
 an antigen (e.g., chimeric OspA molecules) against which antigen-specific antibodies
are raised, an adjuvant that stimulates the subject host's immune response, and a
suitable immunologically-inert, pharmaceutically-acceptable carrier. Optionally, an
immunogenic composition comprises one or more stabilizers. Optionally, an
immunogenic composition comprises one or more antimicrobial preservatives.
[00126]        The terms "vaccine" or "vaccine composition" refer to a biological
preparation that improves immunity to a particular disease (e.g., Lyme disease or
                                                 32

   Borreliainfection). A vaccine typically contains an agent that resembles a disease
   causing microorganism (e.g., chimeric OspA molecules (antigen) of Borrelia). The
  agent stimulates the body's immune system to recognize the agent as foreign,
  destroy it, and "remember" it, so that the immune system can more easily recognize
  and destroy any of these microorganisms that it later encounters. Vaccines, in
  various aspects, are prophylactic (prevent or ameliorate the effects of a future
  infection by any natural or "wild" pathogen), or therapeutic (vaccines against present
  infection). As set forth above, such vaccine compositions include formulations
  comprising pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. Optionally, a vaccine also
  comprises one or more stabilizers and/or one or more antimicrobial preservatives.
  [00127]      The terms "effective amount" and therapeuticallyy effective amount" each
  refer to the amount of nucleic acid molecule, polypeptide, composition, or antibody
  used to support an observable level of one or more biological activities of the OspA
 polypeptides as set forth herein. For example, an effective amount, in some aspects
 of the invention, would be the amount necessary to prevent, neutralize, or reduce a
 Borrelia infection.
 [00128]      The term "combination" refers to two or more nucleic acid molecules of
 the invention, or two or more polypeptides of the invention. In some aspects,
 combinations of molecules of the invention are administered to provide immunity or
 fight infection from at least four of the six serotypes (1-6) of Borrelia described
 herein. In various aspects, combinations of two or three molecules or polypeptides
of the invention are used. In certain aspects, combinations of molecules of the
invention are administered to a subject to provide immunity from all six serotypes (1
6) of Borrelia described herein. The latter combination has been shown to provide
immunity to heterologous strains of Borrelia expressing OspA types not present in
the combination of nucleic acid molecules or polypeptides.
[00129]       The term "combination vaccine" refers to a vaccine formulation containing
more than one vaccine composition or more than one protective antigen to one or
more diseases. The invention includes a combination vaccine comprising OspA
chimeric antigens against Lyme disease or Borrelia in addition to an antigen against
one or more other diseases. In various aspects, one or more of the other diseases is
a tick-borne disease. In certain aspects, the other tick-borne disease is Rocky
Mountain Spotted Fever, Babesiosis, Relapsing Fever, Colorado tick fever, Human
                                              33

    monocytic ehrlichiosis (HME), Human granulocytic ehrlichiosis (HGE), Southern
   Tick-Associated Rash Illness (STARI), Tularemia, Tick paralysis, Powassan
   encephalitis , Q fever, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, Cytauxzoonosis,
   boutonneuse fever, or tick-borne encephalitis. In particular aspects, the invention
   includes a combination vaccine which comprises one or more vaccines, including a
   tick-borne encephalitis vaccine, a Japanese encephalitis vaccine, and a Rocky
   Mountain Spotted Fever vaccine. In some aspects, the combination vaccine
  comprises vaccine compositions that have a seasonal immunization schedule
  compatible with immunization against Borrelia infection or Lyme disease. In more
  particular aspects, combination vaccines are useful in the prevention of multiple
  diseases for use in geographical locations where these diseases are prevalent.
  [00130]       The term "Borrelia" refers to a species of Gram negative bacteria of the
  spirochete class of the genus Borrelia. In one aspect, "Borrelia burgdorferi sensu
  lato (s. .)" refers to Borrelia burgdorferiin the wider sense. Almost all cases of Lyme
  disease or Borreliosis are caused by one of three genospecies, Borrelia afzeli,
  Borrelia garini and Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto (s.s.), which refers to B.
  burgdorferi in the stricter sense). OspA serotypes of Borrelia correlate with species;
 serotype 1 corresponds to B. burgdorferi s.s., serotype 2 corresponds to B. afzelii
 and serotypes 3 to 7 correspond to B. garinfi. Recent literature indicates that OspA
 serotype 4 is proposed to have its own species status as Borrelia bavariensis
 (Margos et al., Appl. Environ, Microbiol. 75: 5410-6, 2009). In various aspects, the
 immunogenic or vaccine compositions of the invention also provide protection
 against other species of Borrela including, but not limited to, Borrellajaponica,
 Borrelia andersoni, Borrelia bissetti, Borrelia sinica, Borrelia turdi, Borrelia tanukii,
 Borrelia valaisiana, Borrelia lusitaniae, Borrelia spielmani, Borrelia miyamotoi or
 Borrelia lonestar.
[00131]        A "subject" is given its conventional meaning of a non-plant, non-protist
living being. In most aspects, the subject is an animal. In particular aspects, the
animal is a mammal. In more particular aspects, the mammal is a human. In other
aspects, the mammal is a pet or companion animal, a domesticated farm animal, or
a zoo animal. In certain aspects, the mammal is a cat, dog, horse, or cow. In
various other aspects, the mammal is a deer, mouse, chipmunk, squirrel, opossum,
or raccoon.

   Lyme Disease (Borreliosis or Lyme Borreliosis)
   [00132]      In some aspects, the invention includes chimeric OspA molecules and
   compositions comprising these molecules in the prevention of Lyme disease or
   Borrelia infection. Lyme Disease is also known in the art as Borreliosis or Lyme
   Borreliosis and, therefore, all of these terms are included in the invention. Likewise,
   the invention includes methods of preventing or treating Lyme disease comprising
   administering the chimeric OspA molecules described herein. Lyme disease, or
   borreliosis, is an infectious disease caused by at least three species of Gram
  negative spirochetal bacteria belonging to the genus Borre/ia. There are at least 13
   Borrelia species which have been discovered, three of which are known to be Lyme
  related. The Borrelia species that cause Lyme disease are collectively known as
  Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, and show a great deal of genetic diversity. The
  group Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato is made up of three closely-related species that
  are probably responsible for the large majority of cases. Borrelia burgdorferi sensu
  stricto is the main cause of Lyme disease in the United States (but it is also present
  in Europe), whereas Borrelia afzelii and Borrelia garinii cause most European cases.
  Recent literature indicates that Borrelia bavariensis, first found in Bavaria, could be
  considered a new species. However, to date, OspA serotype 4 has been considered
 to be a strain of Borrelia garini (Margos et al., 1d). Some studies have also proposed
 that Borrelia species (e.g. Borrelia bissetti, Borella spielmanii, Borrellia lusitaniae,
 and Borrelia valaisiana) may sometimes infect humans. Although these species do
 not seem to be important causes of disease, immunogenic protection against these
 species is also include in the invention.
 [00133]       Lyme disease is the most common tick-borne disease in the Northern
 Hemisphere. The disease is named after the village of Lyme, Connecticut where a
 number of cases were identified in 1975. Borrelia is transmitted to humans by the
 bite of infected ticks belonging to a few species of the genus Ixodes ("hard ticks").
 Early symptoms, in some instances, include fever, headache, fatigue, depression,
and a characteristic circular skin rash called erythema migrans. Left untreated, later
symptoms can often involve the joints, heart, and central nervous system. In most
cases, the infection and its symptoms are eliminated by antibiotics, especially if the
illness is treated early. However, late, delayed, or inadequate treatment can lead to
the more serious symptoms, which can be disabling and difficult to treat.
                                              35

   Occasionally, symptoms such as arthritis persist after the infection has been
   eliminated by antibiotics.
   [00134]     Some groups have argued that "chronic" Lyme disease is responsible for
  a range of medically unexplained symptoms beyond the recognized symptoms of
  late Lyme disease, and that additional, long-term antibiotic treatments are needed.
  However, long-term treatment is controversial and the dispute regarding such
  treatment has led to legal action over treatment guidelines.
  [00135]     Lyme disease is classified as a zoonosis, as it is transmitted to humans
  from a natural reservoir which includes rodents and birds by ticks that feed on both
  sets of hosts. Hard-bodied ticks of the genus Ixodes are the main vectors of Lyme
 disease. Most human infections are caused by ticks in the nymphal stage, as the
  nymphal ticks are very small and may feed for long periods of time undetected. Tick
  bites often go unnoticed because of the small size of the tick in its nymphal stage, as
 well as tick secretions that prevent the host from feeling any itch or pain from the
 bite.
 [00136]      Lyme disease is diagnosed clinically based on symptoms, objective
 physical findings (such as erythema migrans, facial palsy, or arthritis), a history of
 possible exposure to infected ticks, as well as serological blood tests. Approximately
 half of the patients with Lyme disease will develop the characteristic bulls-eye rash,
 but many may not recall a tick bite. Laboratory testing is not recommended for
 persons who do not have symptoms of Lyme disease.
 [00137]      Because of the difficulty in culturing Borre/ia bacteria in the laboratory,
 diagnosis of Lyme disease is typically based on the clinical exam findings and a
 history of exposure to endemic Lyme areas. The Erythema migrans (EM) rash,
 which only occurs in about 50% of all cases, is considered sufficient to establish a
diagnosis of Lyme disease even when serologic blood tests are negative.
 Serological testing can be used to support a clinically suspected case but is not
diagnostic by itself. Diagnosis of late-stage Lyme disease is often difficult because
of the multi-faceted appearance which can mimic symptoms of many other diseases.
For this reason, a reviewer called Lyme the new "great imitator." Lyme disease, in
some instances, is misdiagnosed as multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis,
fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), lupus, or other autoimmune and
                                              36

   neurodegenerative diseases. Thus, there is a great need in the art for a vaccine to
   prevent or treat Lyme disease.
   Outer Surface Protein A (OspA) of Borrelia
   [00138]     In various aspects, the invention includes chimeric OspA molecules of
   Borrelia and compositions comprising these molecules in the prevention and
  treatment of Lyme disease or Borrelia infection. Several Borre/ia outer surface
  proteins have been identified over the past decade that are up-regulated by
  temperature- and/or mammalian host-specific signals as this spirochete is
  transmitted from ticks to mammals.
  [00139]     The major outer surface protein, OspA, of Borrelia burgdorferi is a
  lipoprotein of particular interest because of its potential as a vaccine candidate.
  Serotypic and genetic analysis of OspA from both European and North American
  strains of Borreia have demonstrated antigenic and structural heterogeneities.
  OspA is described in published PCT patent application WO 92/14488, in Jiang et al.
  (Clin. Diagn. Lab. Immunol 1: 406-12, 1994) and is known in the art. Osp A has
 been shown to induce protective immunity in mouse, hamster and dog challenge
 studies. Clinical trials in humans have shown the formulations of OspA to be safe
 and immunogenic in humans (Keller et al., JAMA (1994) 271:1764 1768).
 [00140]      While OspA is expressed in the vast majority of clinical isolates of Borrelia
 burgdorferi from North America, a different picture has emerged from examination of
 the clinical Borrelia isolates in Europe. In Europe, Lyme disease is mainly caused by
 three genospecies of Borreia, namely B. burgdorferi, B. garini and B. afzeli. Recent
 literature indicates that Borrelia bavariensis may be its own genospecies. Thus,
 Borrelia bavariensis has been proposed as a new name for OspA serotype 4, also
 known as a strain of Borrelia garinli (Margos et al., 1d). The invention is directed to
chimeric OspA molecules that provide protective immunity against all genospecies of
Borrelia. The invention describes the design and synthesis of three chimeric OspA
genes that encode for three distinct lipidated OspA molecules that share common
features. Each gene represents two OspA serotypes and the genes were designed
to encode stable OspA molecules that are safe and highly immunogenic, and afford
a subject protection against infection with B. burgdorferi sensu lato (s.L). The
invention also describes three original chimeric OspA genes without mutations and
                                             37

  without codon optimization that encode three distinct lipidated OspA molecules that
  share common features. Each gene represents two OspA serotypes and encode
   molecules that afford a subject protection against infection with B. burgdorferi sensu
  lato (s.i).
  [00141]      Seven principal OspA serotypes have been recognized among European
  isolates (designated serotypes 1 to 7, Wilske et al., J. Clin. MicrobioL 31:340-50,
  1993). OspA serotypes correlate with species; serotype 1 corresponds to B.
  burgdorferi s.s., serotype 2 corresponds to B. afzelii and serotypes 3 to 7 correspond
  to B. garinii. Serotype 4, in some aspects, is alternatively considered Borre/a
  bavariensis. (See Margos et al., Id). Epidemiological studies of European Borrelia
  isolates indicate that a vaccine based on OspA types 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 would
  provide theoretical coverage in Europe of 98.1 % of Lyme disease and cover 96.7%
  of invasive disease isolates. The invention provides six chimeric OspA nucleic acid
  molecules (SEQ ID NOS: 1, 3, and 5, and SEQ ID NOS: 168, 170, and 172) and six
  chimeric OspA polypeptide molecules (SEQ ID NOS: 2, 4, and 6, and SEQ ID NOS:
  169, 171, and 173) that can provide protective immunity against all six serotypes 1-6.
 Six synthetic OspA genes were designed to encode OspA molecules with the
 protective epitopes from OspA serotypes 1 and 2 (lipB sOspA 1/2251 (SEQ ID NOS: 1
 (nucleic acid) and 2 (amino acid) and orig sOspA 1/2 (SEQ ID NOS: 168 (nucleic
 acid) and 169 (amino acid)); OspA serotypes 6 and 4 (lipB sOspA 6/4 (SEQ ID NOS:
 3 (nucleic acid) and 4 (amino acid) and orig sOspA 6/4 (SEQ ID NOS: 170 (nucleic
 acid) and 171 (amino acid)); and OspA serotypes 5 and 3 (lipB sOspA 5/3 (SEQ ID
 NOS: 5 (nucleic acid) and 6 (amino acid) and orig sOspA 5/3 (SEQ ID NOS: 172
 (nucleic acid) and 173 (amino acid)). The chimeric OspA genes were made using
synthetic overlapping oligonucleotides. These recombinant proteins are, in certain
aspects, produced at high yield and purity and, in various aspects, manipulated to
maximize desirable activities and minimize undesirable ones.
Chimeric OspA Nucleic Acid Molecules and Polypeptide Molecules
[00142]       In various aspects, the invention includes chimeric OspA nucleic acid and
polypeptide molecules of Borrelia. The OspA nucleic acids of the invention include a
nucleic acid molecule comprising, consisting essentially of, or consisting of a
nucleotide sequence as set forth in SEQ ID NO: 1 (lipB sOspA 1/225), SEQ ID NO: 3
(lipB sOspA 6/4), SEQ ID NO: 5 (lipB sOspA 5/3), SEQ ID NO: 7 (sOspA 1/2251),
                                             38

   SEQ ID NO: 9 (sOspA 6/4), SEQ ID NO: 11 (sOspA 5/3), SEQ ID NO: 168 (orig
   sOspA 1/2), SEQ ID NO: 170 (orig sOspA 6/4), or SEQ ID NO: 172 (orig sOspA 5/3),
  or a nucleotide sequence encoding the polypeptide as set forth in SEQ ID NO: 2
  (lipB sOspA 1/2251), SEQ ID NO: 4 (lipB sOspA 6/4), SEQ ID NO: 6 (IipB sOspA 5/3),
  SEQ ID NO: 8 (sOspA 1/2251), SEQ ID NO: 10 (sOspA 6/4), SEQ ID NO: 12 (sOspA
  5/3), SEQ ID NO: 169 (orig sOspA 1/2), SEQ ID NO: 171 (orig sOspA 6/4), or SEQ
  ID NO: 173 (orig sOspA 5/3).
  [00143]    The nucleic acid sequences of SEQ ID NOS: 7, 9, and 11 lack the nucleic
  acid sequence encoding the lipB leader sequence (MRLLIGFALALALIG (SEQ ID
  NO: 13). In addition, the nucleic acid sequences of SEQ ID NOS: 7, 9, and 11
  encode a methionine residue at the amino terminus of SEQ ID NOS: 8, 10, and 12 in
 place of the cysteine residue present at the carboxy terminus of the lipB leader
 sequence in SEQ ID NOS: 2, 4, and 6. SEQ ID NOS: 1, 3, and 5 are lipB sOspA
 polynucleotides, and SEQ ID NOS: 2, 4, and 6 are lipB sOspA polypeptides.
 [00144]     In some aspects, the invention includes original ("orig") chimeric OspA
 nucleic acid and polypeptide molecules of Borrelia without mutations and without
 codon optimization. The OspA nucleic acids of the invention, therefore, include a
 nucleic acid molecule comprising, consisting essentially of, or consisting of a
 nucleotide sequence as set forth in SEQ ID NO: 168 (orig sOspA 1/2), SEQ ID NO:
 170 (orig sOspA 6/4), or SEQ ID NO: 172 (orig sOspA 5/3), or a nucleotide
 sequence encoding the polypeptide as set forth in SEQ ID NO: 169 (orig sOspA 1/2),
 SEQ ID NO: 171 (orig sOspA 6/4), or SEQ ID NO: 173 (orig sOspA 5/3).

 [00148]     In some embodiments, methods to determine sequence identity and/or
similarity are designed to give the largest match between the sequences tested.
 Methods to determine identity and similarity are described in publicly available
computer programs. In some aspects, computer program methods to determine
identity and similarity between two sequences include, but are not limited to, the
GCG program package, including GAP (Devereux et at, Nucl. Acid. Res., 12:387
(1984); Genetics Computer Group, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI, BLASTP,
BLASTN, and FASTA (Altschul et al., J. Mol. Biol., 215:403-410 (1990)). The
BLASTX program is publicly available from the National Center for Biotechnology
Information (NCBI) and other sources (BLAST Manual, Altschul et al. NCB/NLM/NIH
Bethesda, MD 20894; Altschul et ai., supra (1990)). The well-known Smith
Waterman algorithm is also used to determine identity.
                                            47

   [00149]     Certain alignment schemes for aligning two amino acid sequences, in
   some aspects, result in the matching of only a short region of the two sequences,
   and this small aligned region may have very high sequence identity even though
   there is no significant relationship between the two full-length sequences.
  Accordingly, in one embodiment the selected alignment method (GAP program) will
  result in an alignment that spans at least 50 contiguous amino acids of the target
  polypeptide. For example, using the computer algorithm GAP (Genetics Computer
  Group, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI), two polypeptides for which the
  percent sequence identity is to be determined are aligned for optimal matching of
  their respective amino acids (the "matched span", as determined by the algorithm).
  A gap opening penalty (which is calculated as 3x the average diagonal; the "average
  diagonal" is the average of the diagonal of the comparison matrix being used; the
  "diagonal" is the score or number assigned to each perfect amino acid match by the
  particular comparison matrix) and a gap extension penalty (which is usually 1/10
 times the gap opening penalty), as well as a comparison matrix such as PAM 250 or
  BLOSUM 62 are used in conjunction with the algorithm. A standard comparison
 matrix (see Dayhoff et al., Atlas of Protein Sequence and Structure, 5(3)(1978) for
 the PAM 250 comparison matrix; Henikoff et al., Proc. Nati. A cad. Sci USA,
 89:10915-10919 (1992) for the BLOSUM 62 comparison matrix) is also used by the
 algorithm.
 [001501      In various aspects, parameters for a polypeptide sequence comparison
 include the following:
         Algorithm: Needleman et al., J. Mol. Biol., 48:443-453 (1970);
         Comparison matrix: BLOSUM 62 from Henikoff et al., supra (1992);
         Gap Penalty: 12
         Gap Length Penalty: 4
         Threshold of Similarity: 0
[00151)      The GAP program is useful with the above parameters. The
aforementioned parameters are the default parameters for polypeptide comparisons
(along with no penalty for end gaps) using the GAP algorithm.
                                             48

    [00152]    In some aspects, parameters for nucleic acid molecule sequence
   comparisons include the following:
          Algorithm: Needleman et al., supra (1970);
          Comparison matrix: matches = +10, mismatch = 0
          Gap Penalty: 50
          Gap Length Penalty: 3
   [00153]    The GAP program is also useful with the above parameters. The
  aforementioned parameters are the default parameters for nucleic acid molecule
  comparisons. Other exemplary algorithms, gap opening penalties, gap extension
  penalties, comparison matrices, thresholds of similarity, and the like, are used by
  those of skill in the art, including those set forth in the Program Manual, Wisconsin
  Package, Version 9, September, 1997. The particular choices to be made will be
  apparent to those of skill in the art and will depend on the specific comparison to be
  made, such as DNA-to-DNA, protein-to-protein, protein-to-DNA; and additionally,
  whether the comparison is between given pairs of sequences (in which case GAP or
  BestFit are generally preferred) or between one sequence and a large database of
 sequences (in which case FASTA or BLASTA are preferred).
 [00154]      Differences in the nucleic acid sequence, in some aspects, result in
 conservative and/or non-conservative modifications of the amino acid sequence
 relative to the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2 (lipB sOspA 1/2251), SEQ ID
 NO: 4 (lipB sOspA 6/4), SEQ ID NO: 6 (lipB sOspA 5/3), SEQ ID NO: 8 (sOspA
 1/2251), SEQ ID NO: 10 (sOspA 6/4), SEQ ID NO: 12 (sOspA 5/3), SEQ ID NO: 169
 (orig sOspA 1/2), SEQ ID NO: 171 (orig sOspA 6/4), or SEQ ID NO: 173 (orig sOspA
5/3).
[00155]      Conservative modifications to the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2
(lipB sOspA 1/2251), SEQ ID NO: 4 (lipB sOspA 6/4), SEQ ID NO: 6 (lipB sOspA 5/3),
SEQ ID NO: 8 (sOspA 1/2251), SEQ ID NO: 10 (sOspA 6/4), SEQ ID NO: 12 (sOspA
5/3), SEQ ID NO: 169 (orig sOspA 1/2), SEQ ID NO: 171 (orig sOspA 6/4), or SEQ
ID NO: 173 (orig sOspA 5/3) (and corresponding modifications to the encoding
nucleotides) will produce OspA polypeptides having functional and chemical
characteristics similar to those of a naturally occurring OspA polypeptide. In
                                              49

    contrast, substantial modifications in the functional and/or chemical characteristics of
    OspA polypeptides are accomplished by selecting substitutions in the amino acid
    sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2 (lipB sOspA 1/2251), SEQ ID NO: 4 (lipB sOspA 6/4),
    SEQ ID NO: 6 (lipB sOspA 5/3), SEQ ID NO: 8 (sOspA 1/2251), SEQ ID NO: 10
    (sOspA 6/4), SEQ ID NO: 12 (sOspA 5/3), SEQ ID NO: 169 (orig sOspA 1/2), SEQ
    ID NO: 171 (orig sOspA 6/4), or SEQ ID NO: 173 (orig sOspA 5/3) that differ
   significantly in their effect on maintaining (a) the structure of the molecular backbone
   in the area of the substitution, for example, as a sheet or helical conformation, (b) the
   charge or hydrophobicity of the molecule at the target site, or (c) the bulk of the side
   chain.
   [00156]      For example, a "conservative amino acid substitution," in some aspects,
   involves a substitution of a native amino acid residue with a nonnative residue such
  that there is little or no effect on the polarity or charge of the amino acid residue at
  that position. Furthermore, any native residue in the polypeptide, in certain aspects,
  is also substituted with alanine, as has been previously described for "alanine
  scanning mutagenesis."
  [00157]      Conservative amino acid substitutions also encompass non-naturally
  occurring amino acid residues which are typically incorporated by chemical peptide
  synthesis rather than by synthesis in biological systems. These include
  peptidomimetics and other reversed or inverted forms of amino acid moieties.
 [00158]       Naturally occurring residues, in various aspects, are divided into classes
 based on common side chain properties:
 1)       hydrophobic: norleucine, Met, Ala, Val, Leu, lie;
 2)       neutral hydrophilic: Cys, Ser, Thr, Asn, Gin;
 3)       acidic: Asp, Glu;
 4)      basic: His, Lys, Arg;
5)       residues that influence chain orientation: Gly, Pro; and
6)       aromatic: Trp, Tyr, Phe.
[00159]       For example, non-conservative substitutions, in some aspects, involve the
exchange of a member of one of these classes for a member from another class.
Such substituted residues, in various aspects, are introduced into regions of the
                                               50

     OspA polypeptide that are homologous, or similar, with OspA polypeptide orthologs,
    or into the non-homologous regions of the molecule.
    [00160]     In making such changes, the hydropathic index of amino acids is often
    considered. Each amino acid has been assigned a hydropathic index on the basis of
    its hydrophobicity and charge characteristics. They are: isoleucine (+4.5); valine
    (+4.2); leucine (+3.8); phenylalanine (+2.8); cysteine/cystine (+2.5); methionine
    (+1.9); alanine (+1.8); glycine (-0.4); threonine (-0.7); serine (-0.8); tryptophan (-0.9);
   tyrosine (-1.3); proline (-1 .6); histidine (-3.2); glutamate (-3.5); glutamine (-3.5);
   aspartate (-3.5); asparagine (-3.5); lysine (-3.9); and arginine (-4.5).
   [00161]      The importance of the hydropathic amino acid index in conferring
   interactive biological function on a protein is understood in the art. Kyte et al., J Mo.
   Bo, 157:105-131 (1982). It is known that certain amino acids may be substituted
   for other amino acids having a similar hydropathic index or score and still retain a
   similar biological activity. In making changes based upon the hydropathic index, the
  substitution of amino acids whose hydropathic indices are within 2 is, in certain
  aspects, preferred, those which are within 1 are, in other aspects, particularly
  preferred, and those within 0.5 are, in various aspects, more particularly preferred.
  [00162]      It is also understood in the art that the substitution of like amino acids can
  be made effectively on the basis of hydrophilicity, particularly where the biologically
  functional equivalent protein or peptide thereby created is intended, in part, for use in
  immunological embodiments, as in the present case. The greatest local average
 hydrophilicity of a protein, as governed by the hydrophilicity of its adjacent amino
 acids, correlates with its immunogenicity and antigenicity, i.e., with a biological
 property of the protein.
 [00163]       The following hydrophilicity values have been assigned to these amino
acid residues: arginine (+3.0); lysine (+3.0); aspartate (+3.0  1); glutamate (+3.0
 1); serine (+0.3); asparagine (+0.2); glutamine (+0.2); glycine (0); threonine (-04);
proline (-0.5  1); alanine (-0.5); histidine (-0.5); cysteine (-1.0); methionine (-1.3);
valine (-1.5); leucine (-1.8); isoleucine (-1.8); tyrosine (-2.3); phenylalanine (-2.5) and
tryptophan (-3.4). In making changes based upon similar hydrophilicity values, the
substitution of amino acids whose hydrophilicity values are within 2 is, in certain
aspects, preferred, those which are within 1 are in other aspects, particularly
                                                 51

  preferred, and those within 0.5 are, in various aspects, more particularly preferred.
  One of skill also identifies epitopes from primary amino acid sequences on the basis
  of hydrophilicity. These regions are also referred to as "epitopic core regions."
  [00164]      Desired amino acid substitutions (whether conservative or non
  conservative) can be determined by those skilled in the art at the time such
 substitutions are desired. For example, amino acid substitutions can be used to
 identify important residues of the OspA polypeptide, or to increase or decrease the
 affinity of the OspA polypeptides for their substrates, described herein.
 [00165]       In some aspects, substitutions of nucleotides in nucleotide sequences
 and amino acids in amino acid sequences are included in the invention. The
substitutions include one to 5, one to 10, one to 15, one to 20, one to 25, one to 30,
one to 35, one to 40, one to 45, one to 50, one to 55, one to 60, one to 65, one to 70,
one to 75, one to 80, one to 85, one to 90, one to 95, one to 100, one to 150, and
one to 200 nucleotides. Likewise, substitutions include one to 5, one to 10, one to
15, one to 20, one to 25, one to 30, one to 35, one to 40, one to 45, one to 50, one to
55, one to 60, one to 65, one to 70, one to 75, one to 80, one to 85, one to 90, one to
95, and one to 100 amino acids. The substitutions, in various aspects, are
conservative or non-conservative.

[00166]     A skilled artisan can determine suitable analogs or variants of the
polypeptide as set forth in SEQ ID NO: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 169, 171, or 173 using well
known techniques. For identifying suitable areas of the molecule that may be
changed without destroying activity, one skilled in the art may target areas not
believed to be important for activity. For example, when similar polypeptides with
                                              53

    similar activities from the same species or from other species are known, one skilled
    in the art may compare the amino acid sequence of an OspA polypeptide to such
    similar polypeptides. With such a comparison, one can identify residues and
    portions of the molecules that are conserved among similar polypeptides. It will be
    appreciated that changes in areas of an OspA polypeptide that are not conserved
   relative to such similar polypeptides would be less likely to adversely affect the
   biological activity and/or structure of the OspA polypeptide. One skilled in the art
   would also know that, even in relatively conserved regions, one may substitute
   chemically similar amino acids for the naturally occurring residues while retaining
   activity (conservative amino acid residue substitutions).
   [00167]      In some embodiments, OspA polypeptide variants include glycosylation
  variants wherein the number and/or type of glycosylation sites has been altered
  compared to the amino acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12,
   169, 171, or 173. In one embodiment, OspA polypeptide variants comprise a greater
  or a lesser number of N-linked glycosylation sites than the amino acid sequence set
  forth in SEQ ID NO: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 169, 171, or 173. An N-linked glycosylation
  site is characterized by the sequence: Asn-X-Ser or Asn-X-Thr, wherein the amino
  acid residue designated as X may be any amino acid residue except proline. The
  substitution of amino acid residues to create this sequence provides a potential new
  site for the addition of an N-linked carbohydrate chain. Alternatively, substitutions
  which eliminate this sequence will remove an existing N-linked carbohydrate chain.
 Also provided is a rearrangement of N-linked carbohydrate chains wherein one or
  more N-linked glycosylation sites (typically those that are naturally occurring) are
 eliminated and one or more new N-linked sites are created. Additional OspA
 variants include cysteine variants wherein one or more cysteine residues are deleted
 from or substituted for another amino acid (e.g., serine) as compared to the amino
 acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 169, 171, or 173. Cysteine
 variants are useful when OspA polypeptides must be refolded into a biologically
active conformation such as after the isolation of insoluble inclusion bodies.
Cysteine variants generally have fewer cysteine residues than the native protein, and
typically have an even number to minimize interactions resulting from unpaired
cysteines.
                                              54

   [00168]     The invention further provides polypeptides that comprise an epitope
   bearing portion of a protein as shown in SEQ ID NO: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 169, 171, or
    173. The term, "epitope" refers to a region of a protein to which an antibody can
   bind, See e.g., Geysen et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 81:3998-4002 (1984).
   Epitopes can be linear or conformational, the latter being composed of discontinuous
   regions of the protein that form an epitope upon folding of the protein. Linear
  epitopes are generally at least 6 amino acid residues in length. Relatively short
  synthetic peptides that mimic part of a protein sequence are routinely capable of
  eliciting an antiserum that reacts with the partially mimicked protein. See, Sutcliffe et
  al., Science 219:660-666 (1983). Antibodies that recognize short, linear epitopes are
  particularly useful in analytic and diagnostic applications that employ denatured
  protein, such as Western blotting. See Tobin, Proc. Nati. Acad. Sci. USA, 76:4350
  4356 (1979). Antibodies to short peptides, in certain instances, also recognize
  proteins in native conformation and will thus be useful for monitoring protein
  expression and protein isolation, and in detecting OspA proteins in solution, such as
  by ELISA or in immunoprecipitation studies.
 Synthesis of Chimeric OspA Nucleic Acid Molecules and Polypeptide
  Molecules
 [00169]      The nucleic acid molecules encode a polypeptide comprising the amino
 acid sequence of an OspA polypeptide and can readily be obtained in a variety of
 ways including, without limitation, recombinant DNA methods and chemical
 synthesis.
 [00170]      Recombinant DNA methods are generally those set forth in Sambrook et
al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press,
Cold Spring Harbor, NY (1989), and/or Ausubel et al., eds., Current Protocols in
Molecular Biology, Green Publishers Inc. and Wiley and Sons, NY (1994).
Recombinant expression techniques conducted in accordance with the descriptions
set forth below, in various aspects, are followed to produce these polynucleotides
and to express the encoded polypeptides. For example, by inserting a nucleic acid
sequence which encodes the amino acid sequence of an OspA polypeptide into an
appropriate vector, one skilled in the art can readily produce large quantities of the
desired nucleotide sequence. The sequences can then be used to generate
detection probes or amplification primers. Alternatively, a polynucleotide encoding
                                             55

    the amino acid sequence of an OspA polypeptide can be inserted into an expression
    vector. By introducing the expression vector into an appropriate host, the encoded
    OspA polypeptide or OspA polypeptides are, in some aspects, produced in large
    amounts.
    [00171]     Likewise, chemical synthesis of nucleic acids and polypeptides are well
    known in the art, such as those described by Engels et al., Angew. Chem. Intl. Ed.,
    28:716-734 (1989). These methods include, inter alia, the phosphotriester,
    phosphoramidite and H-phosphonate methods for nucleic acid synthesis. In one
   aspect, a method for such chemical synthesis is polymer-supported synthesis using
   standard phosphoramidite chemistry. Typically, the DNA encoding the amino acid
   sequence of an OspA polypeptide will be several hundred nucleotides in length.
   Nucleic acids larger than about 100 nucleotides are synthesized as several
   fragments using these methods. The fragments are then ligated together to form the
  full-length nucleotide sequences of the invention. In particular aspects, the DNA
  fragment encoding the amino terminus of the polypeptide has an ATG, which
  encodes a methionine residue.
  [00172]      In a particular aspect of the invention, chimeric OspA coding sequences
  are made using synthetic overlapping oligonucleotides. Because DNA from Borrelia
  cells is not used, a further benefit of the synthetic approach is the avoidance of
 contamination with adventitious agents contained in material of animal origin (i.e.
 serum or serum albumin) present in Borre/ia culture medium. This strategy also
 substantially reduces the number of manipulations required to make the chimeric
 genes, since it allows sequence alterations to be made in a single step, such as
 modifications to optimize expression (OspB leader sequence), to introduce restriction
 sites to facilitate cloning, or to avoid potential intellectual property issues. It also
 enables codon usage to be optimized for an E. coli host, since the presence of
 codons that are rarely used in E. co/i is known to present a potential impediment to
 high-level expression of foreign genes (Makoff et al., Nucleic Acids Res. 17:10191
202, 1989; Lakey et al., Infect. Immun. 68:233-8, 2000). Other methods known to
the skilled artisan are used as well.
[00173]       In certain embodiments, nucleic acid variants contain codons which have
been altered for the optimal expression of an OspA polypeptide in a given host cell.
Particular codon alterations depend upon the OspA polypeptide(s) and host cell(s)
                                               56

     selected for expression. Such "codon optimization" can be carried out by a variety of
     methods, for example, by selecting codons which are preferred for use in highly
     expressed genes in a given host cell. Computer algorithms which incorporate codon
    frequency tables such as "Ecohigh.cod" for codon preference of highly expressed
    bacterial genes are used, in some instances, and are provided by the University of
    Wisconsin Package Version 9.0, Genetics Computer Group, Madison, WI. Other
    useful codon frequency tables include "Celegans high.cod", "Celeganslow.cod",
    "Drosophila high.cod", "Humanhigh.cod", "Maizehigh.cod", and "Yeast high.cod,"
    [00174]     A nucleic acid molecule encoding the amino acid sequence of an OspA
    polypeptide, in certain aspects, is inserted into an appropriate expression vector
   using standard ligation techniques. The vector is typically selected to be functional
   in the particular host cell employed (i.e., the vector is compatible with the host cell
   machinery such that amplification of the gene and/or expression of the gene can
   occur). A nucleic acid molecule encoding the amino acid sequence of an OspA
   polypeptide, in various aspects, is amplified/expressed in prokaryotic, yeast, insect
   (baculovirus systems), and/or eukaryotic host cells. Selection of the host cell
  depends in part on whether an OspA polypeptide is to be post-translationally
  modified (e.g., glycosylated and/or phosphorylated). If so, yeast, insect, or
  mammalian host cells are preferable. For a review of expression vectors, see Meth.
  Enz., vol.185, D.V. Goeddel, ed., Academic Press Inc., San Diego, CA (1990).
  [00175]      Cloning vectors include all those known in the art. See, e.g., Sambrook,
  Fritsch & Maniatis, Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Second Edition. Cold
  Spring Harbor, N.Y.: Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1989. In one aspect,
  pUC18 is used as the cloning vector for all intermediate steps, because genetic
  manipulations and sequencing are easier with this plasmid than with the vector
 pET30a. The principal features are notably, the lacZ gene fragment coding for LacZ
 alpha peptide from base pairs 149 to 469 (lac promoter at base pairs 507), the bla
 gene encoding the ampicillin resistance determinant from base pairs 1629 to 2486
 (bla promoter at base pairs 2521), the origin of replication at base pairs 867 and
 multiple cloning sites from base pairs 185 to 451 (Fig. 12).
[00176]       Expression vectors include all those known in the art, including without
limitation cosmids, plasmids (e.g., naked or contained in liposomes) and viruses that
incorporate the recombinant polynucleotide. The expression vector is inserted (e.g.,
                                              57

   via transformation or transduction) into an appropriate host cell for expression of the
   polynucleotide and polypeptide via transformation or transfection using techniques
   known in the art. See, e.g., Sambrook, Fritsch & Maniatis, Molecular Cloning: A
   Laboratory Manual, Second Edition. Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y.: Cold Spring Harbor
   Laboratory Press, 1989. In one aspect, pET30a (Novagen) is used as the
   expression vector for the final complete OspA gene insert. In pET vectors, genes
   are cloned under the control of a T7 promoter and expression is induced by
   providing a source of T7 RNA polymerase in the host cell (no expression occurs until
   a source of T7 RNA polymerase is provided). The principal features are the gene
   encoding kanamycin resistance (kan) at base pairs 4048 to 4860, the lac gene base
  pairs 826 - 1905, the F1 origin of replication at base pairs 4956-5411 and multiple
  cloning sites from base pairs 158 to 346 (Fig. 13).
  [00177]     After the vector has been constructed and a nucleic acid molecule
  encoding an OspA polypeptide has been inserted into the proper site of the vector,
  the completed vector is inserted into a suitable host cell for amplification and/or
  polypeptide expression. The transformation of an expression vector for an OspA
 polypeptide into a selected host cell is, in various aspects, accomplished by well
 known methods such as transfection, infection, calcium chloride-mediated
 transformation, electroporation, microinjection, lipofection or the DEAE-dextran
 method or other known techniques. The method selected will in part be a function of
 the type of host cell to be used. These methods and other suitable methods are well
 known to the skilled artisan and are set forth, for example, in Sambrook et al., supra.
 [00178]     Host cells, in some aspects, are prokaryotic host cells (such as E col) or
eukaryotic host cells (such as yeast, insect or vertebrate cells). The host cell, when
cultured under appropriate conditions, synthesizes an OspA polypeptide which can
subsequently be collected from the culture medium (if the host cell secretes it into
the medium) or directly from the host cell producing it (if it is not secreted). The
selection of an appropriate host cell depends upon various factors, such as desired
expression levels, polypeptide modifications that are desirable or necessary for
activity (such as glycosylation or phosphorylation), and ease of folding into a
biologically active molecule. Such host cells include, but are not limited to, host cells
of bacterial, yeast, fungal, viral, invertebrate, and mammalian sources. For
examples of such host cells, see Maniatis et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory
                                              58

   Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. (1989). In
  additional aspects, host cells used in the art since the publication of the Maniatis
   (supra) manual are also used in the invention.
  [00179]      In one aspect, the host cell is an E. coli cell. Suitable strains of E. coli
  include, but are not limited to, BL21, DH5a, HMS174(DE3), DH1 0B, or E. CLONI
  1OG (Lucigen, Middleton, Wis.). In some embodiments, host cells are engineered to
  enhance transformation efficiency and/or maintenance of the vector.
  [00180]      In one aspect, the E coli strain DH5ci [genotype: end Al hsdR17 (rK
  mK+) supE44 thi-1 recAl gyrA (NaIr) relAl D(lacZYA-argF)U1 69 deoR
  (F80dlacD(lacZ)M1 5] (Gibco BRL) is used for all intermediate cloning steps. This
  strain is derived from E coli strain K1 2, one of the most widely used hosts in genetic
 engineering. The strain is amp- to allow selection of transformants with vectors
 containing the ampicillin resistance gene (amp).
 [00181]      In another aspect, the E coli strain HMS174(DE3) is used as the host for
 expression. E. coli HMS174(DE3) host cells [genotype : F- recAl hsdR (rkl2
 mk1 2+) RifR (DE3)] (Novagen) are used in various examples described herein for
 the final cloning steps. The strain is kan- to allow selection of transformants with
 vectors containing the kanamycin resistance gene (kan).
 [00182]      Host cells comprising an OspA polypeptide expression vector are cultured
 using standard media well known to the skilled artisan. The media will usually
 contain all nutrients necessary for the growth and survival of the cells. Suitable
 media for culturing E. coli cells include, for example, Luria Broth (LB) and/or Terrific
 Broth (TB). Suitable media for culturing eukaryotic cells include Roswell Park
 Memorial Institute medium 1640 (RPMI 1640), Minimal Essential Medium (MEM)
and/or Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM), all of which, in some instances,
are supplemented with serum and/or growth factors as indicated by the particular cell
line being cultured. A suitable medium for insect cultures is Grace's medium
supplemented with yeastolate, lactalbumin hydrolysate and/or fetal calf serum, as
necessary.
[001 83]     Typically, an antibiotic or other compound useful for selective growth of
transformed cells is added as a supplement to the media. The compound to be used
will be dictated by the selectable marker element present on the plasmid with which
                                              59

    the host cell was transformed. For example, where the selectable marker element is
    kanamycin resistance, the compound added to the culture medium will be
    kanamycin. Other compounds for selective growth include ampicillin, tetracycline
    and neomycin.
    [00184]      The amount of an OspA polypeptide produced by a host cell can be
    evaluated using standard methods known in the art. Such methods include, without
   limitation, Western blot analysis, SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, non
   denaturing gel electrophoresis, chromatographic separation such as Hgh
   Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC), immunodetection such as
   immunoprecipitation, and/or activity assays such as DNA binding gel shift assays.
   [00185]      In some cases, an OspA polypeptide is not biologically active upon
   isolation. Various methods for "refolding" or converting the polypeptide to its tertiary
   structure and generating disulfide linkages are used to restore biological activity.
  Such methods include exposing the solubilized polypeptide to a pH usually above 7
  and in the presence of a particular concentration of a chaotrope. The selection of
  chaotrope is very similar to the choices used for inclusion body solubilization, but
  usually the chaotrope is used at a lower concentration and is not necessarily the
  same as chaotropes used for the solubilization. In some instances, the
  refolding/oxidation solution also contains a reducing agent or the reducing agent plus
  its oxidized form in a specific ratio to generate a particular redox potential allowing
 for disulfide shuffling to occur in the formation of the protein's cysteine bridge(s).
 Some of the commonly used redox couples include cysteine/cystamine, glutathione
 (GSH)/dithiobis GSH, cuprous chloride, dithiothreitol(DTT)/ dithiane DTT, and 2
 2mercaptoethanol(bME)/dithio-b(ME). A cosolvent is often used to increase the
 efficiency of the refolding, and the more common reagents used for this purpose
 include glycerol, polyethylene glycol of various molecular weights, arginine and the
like.
[00186]        If inclusion bodies are not formed to a significant degree upon expression
of an OspA polypeptide, then the polypeptide will be found primarily in the
supernatant after centrifugation of the cell homogenate. The polypeptide is further
isolated from the supernatant using methods such as those described herein or
otherwise known in the art.
                                               60

     [00187]    The purification of an OspA polypeptide from solution can be
     accomplished using a variety of techniques known in the art. If the polypeptide has
    been synthesized such that it contains a tag such as Hexahistidine (OspA
    polypeptide/hexaHis) or other small peptide such as FLAG (Eastman Kodak Co.,
    New Haven, CT) or myc (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) at either its carboxyl or amino
    terminus, the polypeptide is often purified in a one-step process by passing the
    solution through an affinity column where the column matrix has a high affinity for the
   tag. For example, polyhistidine binds with great affinity and specificity to nickel; thus
   an affinity column of nickel (such as the Qiagen@ nickel columns) can be used for
   purification of OspA polypeptide/polyHis. See for example, Ausubel et al., eds.,
   Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Section 10.11.8, John Wiley & Sons, New
   York (1993).
   [00188]     Additionally, the OspA polypeptide may be purified through use of a
   monoclonal antibody which is capable of specifically recognizing and binding to the
  OspA polypeptide. Suitable procedures for purification thus include, without
  limitation, affinity chromatography, immunoaffinity chromatography, ion exchange
  chromatography, molecular sieve chromatography, High Performance Liquid
  Chromatography (HPLC), electrophoresis (including native gel electrophoresis)
  followed by gel elution, and preparative isoelectric focusing ("Isoprime"
  machine/technique, Hoefer Scientific, San Francisco, CA). In some cases, two or
  more purification techniques are combined to achieve increased purity.
 [00189]       OspA polypeptides are also prepared by chemical synthesis methods
 (such as solid phase peptide synthesis) using techniques known in the art, such as
 those set forth by Merrifield et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc., 85:2149 (1963), Houghten et
 al., Proc. Nati. Acad. Sci. USA, 82:5132 (1985), and Stewart and Young, "Solid
 Phase Peptide Synthesis", Pierce Chemical Co., Rockford, IL (1984). Such
 polypeptides are synthesized with or without a methionine on the amino terminus.
 Chemically synthesized OspA polypeptides, in some aspects, are oxidized using
methods set forth in these references to form disulfide bridges. Chemically
synthesized OspA polypeptides are expected to have comparable biological activity
to the corresponding OspA polypeptides produced recombinantly or purified from
natural sources, and thus are often used interchangeably with a recombinant OspA
polypeptide. It is appreciated that a number of additional methods for producing
                                              61

  nucleic acids and polypeptides are known in the art, and the methods can be used to
  produce OspA polypeptides.
  Chemical Derivatives of OspA Polypeptide Molecules
  [00190]      Chemically modified derivatives of the OspA polypeptides are prepared
  by one skilled in the art, given the disclosures set forth herein below. OspA
  polypeptide derivatives are modified in a manner that is different either in the type or
  location of the molecules naturally attached to the polypeptide. Derivatives, in some
  aspects, include molecules formed by the deletion of one or more naturally-attached
  chemical groups. The polypeptide comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID
  NO: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 169, 171, or 173, or an OspA polypeptide variant, in one
  aspect, is modified by the covalent attachment of one or more polymers. For
 example, the polymer selected is typically water soluble so that the protein to which it
 is attached does not precipitate in an aqueous environment, such as a physiological
 environment. Included within the scope of suitable polymers is a mixture of
 polymers. In certain aspects, for therapeutic use of the end-product preparation, the
 polymer will be pharmaceutically acceptable.
 [00191]     The polymers each are, in various aspects, of any molecular weight and
 are branched or unbranched. The polymers each typically have an average
 molecular weight of between about 2kDa to about 1OOkDa (the term "about"
 indicating that in preparations of a water-soluble polymer, some molecules will weigh
 more, some less, than the stated molecular weight). The average molecular weight
of each polymer is, in various aspects, between about 5kDa to about 5OkDa,
between about 12kDa to about 40kDa, and between about 20kDa to about 35kDa.
[00192]      Suitable water-soluble polymers or mixtures thereof include, but are not
limited to, N-linked or 0-linked carbohydrates; sugars; phosphates; polyethylene
glycol (PEG) (including the forms of PEG that have been used to derivatize proteins,
including mono-(C1-C1 0) alkoxy- or aryloxy-polyethylene glycol); monomethoxy
polyethylene glycol; dextran (such as low molecular weight dextran of, for example,
about 6 kDa);, cellulose; or other carbohydrate-based polymers, poly-(N-vinyl
pyrrolidone) polyethylene glycol, propylene glycol homopolymers, a polypropylene
oxide/ethylene oxide co-polymer, polyoxyethylated polyols (e.g., glycerol) and
polyvinyl alcohol. Also encompassed by the present invention are bifunctional
                                             62

    crosslinking molecules which are sometimes used to prepare covalently attached
    multimers of the polypeptide comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2,
   4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 169, 171, or 173, or an OspA polypeptide variant.
   [00193]      In some aspects, chemical derivatization is performed under any suitable
   condition used to react a protein with an activated polymer molecule. Methods for
   preparing chemical derivatives of polypeptides generally comprise the steps of (a)
   reacting the polypeptide with the activated polymer molecule (such as a reactive
   ester or aldehyde derivative of the polymer molecule) under conditions whereby the
   polypeptide comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2, 4, 6, 8,10,12,
   169, 171, or 173, or an OspA polypeptide variant becomes attached to one or more
   polymer molecules, and (b) obtaining the reaction product(s). The optimal reaction
   conditions are determined based on known parameters and the desired result. For
   example, the larger the ratio of polymer molecules:protein, the greater the
   percentage of attached polymer molecule. In one embodiment, the OspA
  polypeptide derivative has a single polymer molecule moiety at the amino terminus
  (see, for example, U.S. Patent No. 5,234,784).
  [00194]      The pegylation of the polypeptide, in certain aspects, is specifically
  carried out by any of the pegylation reactions known in the art, as described for
  example in the following references: Francis et al., Focus on Growth Factors, 3:4-10
  (1992); EP 0154316; EP 0401384 and U.S. Patent No. 4,179,337. For example,
  pegylation is carried out via an acylation reaction or an alkylation reaction with a
  reactive polyethylene glycol molecule (or an analogous reactive water-soluble
 polymer) as described herein. For the acylation reactions, the polymer(s) selected
 should have a single reactive ester group. For reductive alkylation, the polymer(s)
 selected should have a single reactive aldehyde group. A reactive aldehyde is, for
 example, polyethylene glycol propionaldehyde, which is water stable, or mono C1
 C10 alkoxy or aryloxy derivatives thereof (see U.S. Patent No. 5,252,714).
 [00195]      In another embodiment, OspA polypeptides are chemically coupled to
 biotin, and the biotin/ OspA polypeptide molecules which are conjugated are then
allowed to bind to avidin, resulting in tetravalent avidin/biotin/ OspA polypeptide
 molecules. OspA polypeptides are also covalently coupled to dinitrophenol (DNP) or
trinitrophenol (TNP) and the resulting conjugates precipitated with anti-DNP or anti
TNP-IgM to form decameric conjugates with a valency of 10. The OspA polypeptide
                                             63

    derivatives disclosed herein, in certain aspects, have additional activities, enhanced
    or reduced biological activity, or other characteristics, such as increased or
    decreased half-life, as compared to the non-derivatized molecules.
    Immunogenic Compositions, Vaccines, and Antibodies
    [001961    Some aspects of the invention include immunogenic compositions and
    vaccines. Immuogenic chimeric OspA molecules of the invention are used in
    combination as antigen(s) to elicit an anti-OspA immune response in a subject (i.e.,
   act as a vaccine). Exemplary immunogenic OspA polypeptides (SEQ ID NOS: 2, 4,
   6, 169, 171, and 173) are delivered in combination to elicit an immune response to
   any one or more of serotypes 1-6 of Borrelia, and more generally to many other
   species of Borrelia as discussed herein. An immune response can also be raised by
   delivery of plasmid vectors encoding the OspA polypeptides of the invention (i.e.,
   administration of "naked DNA"). In some aspects, OspA nucleic acid molecules
   (SEQ ID NOS: 1, 3, 5, 168, 170, and 172) are delivered by injection, via liposomes,
  or by other means of administration described herein. Once immunized, the subject
  elicits a heightened immune response against the OspA protein of serotypes 1-6 of
  Borrelia and against other species of Borrelia.
  [00197]     As set out above, therefore, both OspA polypeptides and OspA nucleic
  acid molecules are included as antigens for use in the immunogenic and/or vaccine
  compositions of the invention. In certain aspects, both the nucleic acid and the
 protein are delivered to the subject. In particular aspects, the immune response to a
 nucleic acid vaccine is proposed to be enhanced by simultaneous administration of a
 cognate protein (see WO 99/30733). The nucleic acid and protein do not need to be
 administered in the same composition. Both must merely be administered during the
 induction phase of the immune response with the protein, in some aspects, being
 masked or held back until after the nucleic acid has primed the immune system. In a
particular aspect, vaccines are intended to deliver nucleic acid and protein antigen
into antigen presenting cells (see WO 97/28818). In various aspects, the nucleic
acid and protein are complexed, e.g., by covalent conjugation. In further aspects,
liposomal formulations are also included to enhance the immunogenicity of vaccine
antigens.
                                              64

    [00198]      In certain aspects, an immunogenic composition of the invention includes
    any one or more of the OspA molecules described herein in combination with a
    pharmaceutical carrier, wherein the composition induces production of an antibody
   that specifically binds an Outer surface protein A (OspA) protein. In some aspects,
   the immunogenic composition also comprises a stabilizer or antimicrobial
   preservative. In particular aspects, the immunogenic composition induces
   production of an antibody that specifically binds Borreia. In other aspects, the
   composition induces production of an antibody that neutralizes Borrelia.
   [00199]      In some aspects, the invention includes the use of adjuvants in the
   immunogenic compositions comprising the chimeric OspA molecules (antigens)
   described herein. In certain aspects, immunogenicity is significantly improved if an
   antigen is co-administered with an adjuvant. In some aspects, an adjuvant is used
  as 0.001% to 50% solution in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Adjuvants enhance
  the immunogenicity of an antigen but are not necessarily immunogenic themselves.
  [00200]      Adjuvants, in various aspects, have a number of positive effects on
  vaccination. In some instances, adjuvants accelerate the generation of a robust
  immune response in subjects. Adjuvants, in other instances, increase the level of
  immune response, prolong its duration and improve immune memory. Adjuvants are
  often used to overcome weakened immunity of particular subject groups (e.g., the
  elderly or immune-suppressed patients) or to improve the immunogenicity of
  particular "at risk group" (such as, but not limited to, the very young or elderly). The
 immune enhancing effects of an adjuvant, in various instances, leads to a reduction
 of the amount of antigen required in the final formulation to give a protective
 response (i.e. dose-sparing).
 [00201]      In general, adjuvants are classified, based on their dominant mechanism
 of action, into two main groups: The first group are the agonists of innate immunity
system receptors or sensors, such as Toll-like-receptor (TLR) agonists, C-type lectin
receptor agonists, retinoic acid inducible gene 1 (RIG-1) like receptor (RLR)
agonists, and nucleotide-binding domain and leucine rich repeat-containing receptor
(NLR) agonists. The second group are the substances which act as delivery
systems, also known as TLR-independent adjuvants. Examples of TLR agonist
adjuvants are ASO4 (Glaxo Smith Kline), a TLR-4 agonist, used as an adjuvant in
commercial Hepatitis B and papillioma virus vaccines; Vaxinate, a flagellin-fusion
                                             65

   protein TLR-5 agonist; and numerous TLR-9 agonist adjuvants, such as those that
   use double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) and oligonucleotides CpG or ODNia. Other
   TLR-agonists falling into this category of adjuvants include glycolipids (TLR-1),
   lipoteichoic acid and lipoprotein (TLR-1/TLR-2 and TLR-2/TLR-6) lipopolysaccharide,
   lipooligocaccharides and monophosphoryt lipid A (MPL) (TLR-4), double-stranded
   RNA (TLR-3); peptidoglycan (TLR-6), single stranded RNA (TLR-7). Examples of
  two C-type lectin receptor agonist adjuvants include 13-glucans (Dectin-1) and
   mannans (Dectin-2), both derived from fungal cell walls. RLR receptor agonist
  adjuvants include single-stranded viral RNA and double-stranded viral DNA, while
  NLR agonist adjuvants include peptidoglycan degradation products, microbial
  products, and non-infectious crystal particles. In all cases, the agonists act by
  directly activating the innate immune system receptor to trigger an immune
  enhancing inflammatory response. The second group of adjuvants, the TLR
  independent adjuvants, mostly act as delivery systems and enhance antigen uptake
  and presentation by an antigen presenting cell. In some instances, these adjuvants
  can also act by retaining the antigen locally near the site of administration to produce
  a depot effect facilitating a slow, sustained release of antigen to cells of the immune
  system. Adjuvants also attract cells of the immune system to an antigen depot and
  stimulate such cells to elicit immune responses. Examples of TLR independent
 adjuvants include mineral salts, such as aluminum hydroxide and aluminum
 phosphate (collectively referred to as alum) and calcium phosphate; oil-in-water
 emulsion (e.g., MF59, ASO3 and ProVax); water in oil emulsion (Montanide,
 TiterMax); biopolymers (Advax); plant derivatives, especially fractions of saponin, a
 triterpenoid extract from the bark of the South American Molina soap tree Quillaja
 saponaria (SFA-1, QS21, Quil A); immune stimulating complexes (ISCOM and
 ISCOM matrix) composed of saponin fractions, sterol and, optionally, phospholipids
 (ISCOMATRIX and Matrix-M); liposomes, which are phospholipid spheres of various
sizes and charge (Vaxfectin and Vaxisome); virus-like particles and virosomes,
which are liposomes containing viral surface antigens, such as Influenza
haemagglutinin and neuraminidase; nanoparticles of various composition; chitosan,
peptides such as polyarginine and a peptide known as the KLK peptide.
[00202]      The adjuvants listed herein above are used singly or in combination.
Combinations of TLR-dependent and a TLK-independent adjuvants are often
                                             66

    preferred as the antigen and the TLR-dependent adjuvant are believed to be
    trafficked to antigen presenting cells by the TLR-independent adjuvant, which would
    also stimulate uptake and stability, while the TLR-dependent adjuvant would directly
    enhance immunity through the activation of TLR signaling.
    [00203]     Examples of TLR-dependent and TLR-independent adjuvant
   combinations include ASO1: a mixture of MPL (a TLR-4 agonist), liposomes and QS
   21 (both TLR-independent adjuvant); ASO4: MPL (a TLR-4 agonist) and aluminum
   hydroxide/phosphate; C31: ODNIa (a TLR-9 agonist) and KLK peptide (a TLR
   independent adjuvant); and Freunds complete adjuvant, a membrane extract of
   Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TLR-4 agonist ) and a oil-in-water emulsion (a TLR
   independent adjuvant).
   [00204]      Combinations consisting of multiple TLR-dependent adjuvants are also
   used to maximize the immune enhancing effect of adjuvanted vaccine formulations.
  Agonists of TLRs, which use different adaptor proteins, are often combined (e.g., a
  combination of an agonist for the plasma membrane-bound TLR-3 or TLR-4 receptor
  which utilizes the TRIF (Toll/interleukin 1 receptor domain-containing adaptor protein
  inducing INF-B) adaptor pathway with an agonist of the TLRs (TLR-7, TLR-8 and
  TLR-9), which are expressed in endosomal or lysosomal organelles and utilize the
  MyD88 myeloidd differentiating primary response protein) adaptor protein pathway).
 [00205]       These immunostimulatory agents or adjuvants improve the host immune
 response in vaccines as well. In some cases, substances such as
 lipopolysaccarides can act as intrinsic adjuvants since they normally are the
 components of the killed or attenuated bacteria used as vaccines. Extrinsic
 adjuvants, such as those listed herein above, are immunomodulators which are
typically non-covalently linked to antigens and are formulated to enhance the host
immune response.
[00206]       A wide range of extrinsic adjuvants can provoke potent immune
responses to antigens. These include saponins complexed to membrane protein
antigens (immune stimulating complexes), pluronic polymers with mineral oil, killed
mycobacteria in mineral oil, Freund's complete adjuvant, bacterial products, such as
muramyl dipeptide (MDP) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), as well as lipid A, and
                                             67

   liposomes. To efficiently induce humoral immune response (HIR) and cell-mediated
   immunity (CMI), immunogens are, in certain aspects, emulsified in adjuvants.
   [00207]      Desirable characteristics of ideal adjuvants include any or all of: lack of
   toxicity; ability to stimulate a long-lasting immune response; simplicity of manufacture
   and stability in long-term storage; ability to elicit both CMI and HIR to antigens
  administered by various routes; synergy with other adjuvants; capability of selectively
  interacting with populations of antigen presenting cells (APC); ability to specifically
  elicit appropriate    TH1 or TH2 cell-specific immune responses; and ability to selectively
  increase appropriate antibody isotype levels (for example IgA) against antigens.
  [00208]       U.S. Pat. No. 4,855,283, incorporated herein by reference, thereto
  teaches glycolipid analogs including N-glycosylamides, N-glycosylureas and N
  glycosylcarbamates, each of which is substituted in the sugar residue by an amino
 acid, as immune-modulators or adjuvants. U.S. Pat. No. 4,855,283 reported that N
 glycolipids analogs displaying structural similarities to the naturally occurring
 glycolipids, such as glycosphingolipids and glycoglycerolipids, are capable of eliciting
 strong immune responses in both herpes simplex virus vaccine and pseudorabies
 virus vaccine. Some glycolipids have been synthesized from long chain alkylamines
 and fatty acids that are linked directly with the sugar through the anomeric carbon
 atom, to mimic the functions of the naturally occurring lipid residues.
 [00209]       In some aspects, the immunogenic composition contains an amount of an
 adjuvant sufficient to enhance the immune response to the immunogen. Suitable
 adjuvants include, but are not limited to, aluminium salts (aluminium phosphate or
 aluminium hydroxide), squalene mixtures (SAF-1), muramyl peptide, saponin
derivatives, mycobacterium cell wall preparations, monophosphoryl lipid A, mycolic
acid derivatives, non-ionic block copolymer surfactants, Quil A, cholera toxin B
subunit, polphosphazene and derivatives, and immunostimulating complexes
(ISCOMs) such as those described by Takahashi et al. (Nature 344:873-875, 1990).
In some aspects, the adjuvant is a synthetic adjuvant. In a particular aspect, the
synthetic adjuvant is glucopyranosyl lipid adjuvant (GLA). In exemplary aspects, the
adjuvant is aluminum hydroxide.
[00210]       A further aspect of the invention is a vaccine comprising the immunogenic
composition of the invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. As
                                                 68

  discussed herein above, the vaccine, in certain aspects, includes one or more
  stabilizers and/or one or more preservatives.
  [00211]      In one aspect, there is provided a vaccine comprising at least one
  recombinant expression construct which comprises a promoter operably linked to a
  nucleic acid sequence encoding an antigen (chimeric OspA polypeptide described
  herein) and an adjuvant. In one embodiment the recombinant expression construct
  (expression vector comprising the OspA polynucleotide) is present in a viral vector,
  which in certain further embodiments is present in a virus that is selected from an
  adenovirus, an adeno-associated virus, a herpesvirus, a lentivirus, a poxvirus, and a
  retrovirus.
  [00212]      Further aspects of the invention include antibodies to the chimeric OspA
  molecules described herein. In various aspects, the invention includes the chimeric
 OspA molecules to make anti-OspA antibodies and to provide immunity from Borrelia
 infection. In some aspects, these anti-OspA antibodies, e.g., murine, human, or
 humanized monoclonal antibodies or single chain antibodies, are administered to a
 subject (e.g., passive immunization) to effect an immune response against the OspA
 protein of any one or more of serotypes 1-6 of Borrelia. As used herein, the term
 "antibodies" refers to a molecule which has specificity for one or more OspA
 polypeptides. Suitable antibodies are prepared using methods known in the art. In
 certain aspects, an OspA antibody is capable of binding a certain portion of the
 OspA polypeptide thereby inhibiting the binding of the polypeptide to the OspA
 polypeptide receptor(s). Antibodies and antibody fragments that bind the chimeric
 OspA polypeptides of the invention are within the scope of the present invention.
[00213]       In some aspects, antibodies of the invention include an antibody or
fragment thereof that specifically binds one or more OspA polypeptides produced by
immunizing an animal with a polypeptide comprising the amino acid sequence
selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOS: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 169, 171, and
173. In other aspects, the invention includes an antibody or fragment thereof that
specifically binds to a polypeptide encoded by a nucleic acid sequence selected from
the group consisting of SEQ ID NOS: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 168, 170, and 172. In various
aspects, the antibody or fragment thereof is human, humanized, polyclonal, or
monoclonal. In further aspects, the antibody is an Fab or an Fab' antibody. In
                                             69

    particular aspects, the antibody comprises a detectable label. In some aspects, the
    antibody is a chemically modified derivative of the antibody.
    [00214]     The administration of the chimeric OspA molecules in accordance with
   the invention stimulates an immune or antibody response in humans or animals. In
   some aspects, three chimeric OspA molecules (e.g., lipidated OspA 1/2     251, lipidated
   OspA 6/4 OspA, and lipidated OspA 5/3; or original OspA 1/2, original OspA 6/4, and
   original OspA 5/3) are administered together to elicit antibody response against all
   six serotypes (1-6) discussed herein. This antibody response means that the
   inventive methods are, in various aspects, used for merely stimulating an immune
   response (as opposed to also being a protective response) because the resultant
  antibodies (without protection) are nonetheless useful. From eliciting antibodies, by
  techniques well-known in the art, monoclonal antibodies are prepared; and, those
  monoclonal antibodies are employed in well known antibody binding assays,
  diagnostic kits or tests to determine the presence or absence of Borrelia burgdorferi
  s.L or to determine whether an immune response to the spirochete has simply been
  stimulated. The monoclonal antibodies, in certain aspects, are employed in
  immunoadsorption chromatography to recover or isolate Borrelia antigens such as
 OspA.
 [00215]       The OspA antibodies of the invention, in various aspects, are polyclonal,
 including monospecific polyclonal, monoclonal (MAbs), recombinant, chimeric,
 humanized such as CDR-grafted, human, single chain, and/or bispecific, as well as
 fragments, variants or derivatives thereof. Antibody fragments include those portions
 of the antibody which bind to an epitope on the OspA polypeptide. Examples of such
fragments include Fab and F(ab') fragments generated by enzymatic cleavage of
full-length antibodies. Other binding fragments include those generated by
recombinant DNA techniques, such as the expression of recombinant plasmids
containing nucleic acid sequences encoding antibody variable regions.
[00216]        Polyclonal antibodies directed toward an OspA polypeptide generally are
produced in a subject (including rabbits, mice, or other animal or mammal) by means
of multiple subcutaneous, intramuscular or intraperitoneal injections of OspA
polypeptide and an adjuvant. It is useful, in certain aspects, to conjugate an OspA
polypeptide of the invention to a carrier protein that is immunogenic in the species to
be immunized, such as keyhole limpet hemocyanin, serum, albumin, bovine
                                             70

   thyroglobulin, or soybean trypsin inhibitor. Also, adjuvants, such as alum, are used
   to enhance the immune response. After immunization, blood samples are drawn
   from the subject immunized and the serum is assayed for anti-OspA polypeptide
   antibody titer.
   [00217]     Monoclonal antibodies (mAb) directed toward an OspA polypeptide are
   produced using any method which provides for the production of antibody molecules
   by continuous cell lines in culture. Examples of suitable methods for preparing
   monoclonal antibodies include the hybridoma methods of Kohler et a., Nature,
   256:495-497 (1975) and the human B-cell hybridoma method, Kozbor, J. Immunol.,
   133:3001 (1984) and Brodeur et al., Monoclonal Antibody Production Techniques
  and Applications, pp. 51-63 (Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, 1987). Also provided by
  the invention are hybridoma cell lines which produce monoclonal antibodies reactive
  with OspA polypeptides.
  [00218]     Monoclonal antibodies of the invention, in some instances, are modified
  for use as therapeutics. One embodiment is a "chimeric" antibody in which a portion
  of the heavy and/or light chain is identical with or homologous to a corresponding
  sequence in antibodies derived from a particular species or belonging to a particular
  antibody class or subclass, while the remainder of the chain(s) is/are identical with or
  homologous to a corresponding sequence in antibodies derived from another
  species or belonging to another antibody class or subclass. Also included are
 fragments of such antibodies, so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity.
  See, U.S. Patent No. 4,816,567 and Morrison et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA,
 81:6851-6855 (1985).
 [00219]     In another embodiment, a monoclonal antibody of the invention is a
 "humanized" antibody. Methods for humanizing non-human antibodies are well
 known in the art (see U.S. Patent Nos. 5,585,089, and 5,693,762). Generally, a
 humanized antibody has one or more amino acid residues introduced into it from a
source which is non-human. Humanization can be performed, for example, using
methods described in the art (Jones et at., Nature 321:522-525 (1986); Riechmann
et al., Nature 332:323-327 (1988); Verhoeyen et al., Science 239:1534-1536 (1988)),
by substituting at least a portion of a rodent complementarity-determining region
(CDR) for the corresponding regions of a human antibody.
                                            71

   [00220]      In an alternative embodiment, human antibodies are produced from
   phage-display libraries (Hoogenboom et al., J. Mo. Bio/ 227:381 (1991) and Marks
   et al., J. Mol. Biol. 222:581 (1991)). These processes mimic immune identification
  through the display of antibody repertoires on the surface of filamentous
  bacteriophage, and subsequent selection of phage by their binding to an antigen of
  choice. One such technique is described in PCT Application No. PCT/US98/17364
  (Adams et al.), which describes the isolation of high affinity and functionally agonistic
  antibodies for MPL- and msk-receptors using such an approach.
  [00221]       Chimeric, CDR grafted, and humanized antibodies are typically produced
  by recombinant methods. Nucleic acids encoding the antibodies are introduced into
  host cells and expressed using materials and procedures described herein or known
  in the art. In one embodiment, the antibodies are produced in mammalian host cells,
 such as CHO cells. Monoclonal (e.g., human) antibodies are, in various aspects,
 produced by the expression of recombinant DNA in host cells or by expression in
 hybridoma cells as described herein. In some aspects, the monoclonal antibody or
 fragment thereof is humanized. In a particular aspect, the monoclonal antibody is
 F237/BK2 as described herein.
 [00222]       In certain aspects, the invention includes methods for preventing or
 treating a Borrelia infection or Lyme disease in a subject, the method comprising the
 step of administering an antibody or fragment thereof as described herein to the
subject in an amount effective to prevent or treat the Borre/ia infection or Lyme
disease. In particular aspects, the antibody or fragment thereof is a hyperimmune
serum, a hyperimmune plasma, or a purified immunoglobulin fraction thereof. In
other aspects, the antibody or fragment thereof is a purified immunoglobulin
preparation or an immunoglobulin fragment preparation.
[00223]        The anti-OspA antibodies of the invention, in various aspects, are
employed in any known assay method, such as competitive binding assays, direct
and indirect sandwich assays, and immunoprecipitation assays (Sola, Monoclonal
Antibodies: A Manual of Techniques, pp. 147-158 (CRC Press, Inc., 1987)) for the
detection and quantitation of OspA polypeptides. The antibodies will bind OspA
polypeptides with an affinity which is appropriate for the assay method being
employed.
                                              72

    [00224J    For diagnostic or clinical applications, in certain embodiments, anti-OspA
    antibodies are labeled with a detectable moiety. The detectable moiety can be any
    one which is capable of producing, either directly or indirectly, a detectable signal.
    For example, in certain aspects, the detectable moiety is a radioisotope, such as 3H,
   '4c, 32p, 35S, or 1251; a fluorescent or chemiluminescent compound, such as
   fluorescein isothiocyanate, rhodamine, or luciferin; or an enzyme, such as alkaline
   phosphatase, p-galactosidase, or horseradish peroxidase (Bayer et al., Meth.
   Enzym. 184:138-163 (1990)).
   [00225]     Competitive binding assays rely on the ability of a labeled standard (e.g.,
   an OspA polypeptide, or an immunologically reactive portion thereof) to compete
  with the test sample analyte (an OspA polypeptide) for binding with a limited amount
  of anti- OspA antibody. The amount of an OspA polypeptide in the test sample is
  inversely proportional to the amount of standard that becomes bound to the
  antibodies. To facilitate determining the amount of standard that becomes bound,
  the antibodies typically are insolubilized before or after the competition, so that the
  standard and analyte that are bound to the antibodies are conveniently separated
  from the standard and analyte which remain unbound.
  [00226]     Sandwich assays typically involve the use of two antibodies, each
 capable of binding to a different immunogenic portion, or epitope, of the protein to be
 detected and/or quantitated. In a sandwich assay, the test sample analyte is
 typically bound by a first antibody which is immobilized on a solid support, and
 thereafter a second antibody binds to the analyte, thus forming an insoluble three
 part complex. See, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 4,376,110. The second antibody itself, in
 some instances, is labeled with a detectable moiety (direct sandwich assays) or is
 measured using an anti-immunoglobulin antibody that is labeled with a detectable
 moiety (indirect sandwich assays). For example, one type of sandwich assay is an
 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), in which case the detectable moiety
is an enzyme.
[00227]      The anti-OspA antibodies are also useful for in vivo imaging. An antibody
labeled with a detectable moiety, in certain aspects, is administered to an animal into
the bloodstream, and the presence and location of the labeled antibody in the host is
assayed. The antibody, in various aspects, is labeled with any moiety that is
detectable in an animal, whether by nuclear magnetic resonance, radiology, or other
                                              73

    detection means known in the art. In some aspects of the invention, OspA
    antibodies are used as therapeutics.
    Chimeric OspA Compositions and Administration
    [00228]    To administer OspA chimeric polypeptides described herein to subjects,
    OspA polypeptides are formulated in a composition comprising one or more
    pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. The phrase "pharmaceutically or
    pharmacologically acceptable" refers to molecular entities and compositions that do
    not produce allergic, or other adverse reactions when administered using routes
   well-known in the art, as described below. "Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers"
   include any and all clinically useful solvents, dispersion media, coatings, antibacterial
   and antifungal agents, isotonic and absorption delaying agents and the like. In some
   aspects, the composition forms solvates with water or common organic solvents.
   Such solvates are included as well.
   [00229]    The immunogenic composition or vaccine composition of the invention is,
  in various aspects, administered orally, topically, transdermally, parenterally, by
  inhalation spray, vaginally, rectally, or by intracranial injection. The term parenteral
  as used herein includes subcutaneous injections, intravenous, intramuscular,
  intracisternal injection, or infusion techniques. Administration by intravenous,
  intradermal, intramusclar, intramammary, intraperitoneal, intrathecal, retrobulbar,
  intrapulmonary injection and or surgical implantation at a particular site is
 contemplated as well. Generally, compositions are essentially free of pyrogens, as
 well as other impurities that could be harmful to the recipient.
 [00230]      Formulation of the pharmaceutical composition will vary according to the
 route of administration selected (e.g., solution, emulsion). An appropriate
 composition comprising the composition to be administered is prepared in a
 physiologically acceptable vehicle or carrier. For solutions or emulsions, suitable
 carriers include, for example, aqueous or alcoholic/aqueous solutions, emulsions or
 suspensions, including saline and buffered media. Parenteral vehicles, in some
aspects, include sodium chloride solution, Ringer's dextrose, dextrose and sodium
chloride, lactated Ringer's or fixed oils. Intravenous vehicles, in certain aspects,
include various additives, preservatives, or fluid, nutrient or electrolyte replenishers.
                                              74

   [00231]      Pharmaceutical compositions useful in the compounds and methods of
   the present invention containing OspA polypeptides as an active ingredient contain,
   in various aspects, pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or additives depending on
   the route of administration. Examples of such carriers or additives include water, a
   pharmaceutical acceptable organic solvent, collagen, polyvinyl alcohol,
   polyvinylpyrrolidone, a carboxyvinyl polymer, carboxymethylcellulose sodium,
   polyacrylic sodium, sodium alginate, water-soluble dextran, carboxymethyl starch
  sodium, pectin, methyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose, xanthan gum, gum Arabic, casein,
  gelatin, agar, diglycerin, glycerin, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, Vaseline,
  paraffin, stearyl alcohol, stearic acid, human serum albumin (HSA), mannitol,
  sorbitol, lactose, a pharmaceutically acceptable surfactant and the like. Additives
  used are chosen from, but not limited to, the above or combinations thereof, as
  appropriate, depending on the dosage form of the present invention.
  [00232]      A variety of aqueous carriers, e.g., water, buffered water, 0.4% saline,
 0.3% glycine, or aqueous suspensions contain, in various aspects, the active
 compound in admixture with excipients suitable for the manufacture of aqueous
 suspensions. Such excipients are suspending agents, for example sodium
 carboxymethylcellulose, methylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, sodium
 alginate, polyvinylpyrrolidone, gum tragacanth and gum acacia; dispersing or wetting
 agents, in some instances, are a naturally-occurring phosphatide, for example
 lecithin, or condensation products of an alkylene oxide with fatty acids, for example
 polyoxyethylene stearate, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with long chain
 aliphatic alcohols, for example heptadecaethyl-eneoxycetanol, or condensation
 products of ethylene oxide with partial esters derived from fatty acids and a hexitol
 such as polyoxyethylene sorbitol monooleate, or condensation products of ethylene
 oxide with partial esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, for example
polyethylene sorbitan monooleate. The aqueous suspensions, in some aspects,
contain one or more preservatives, for example ethyl, or n-propyl, p
hydroxybenzoate.
[00233]       In some aspects, OspA compositions are lyophilized for storage and
reconstituted in a suitable carrier prior to use. This technique has been shown to be
effective with conventional immunoglobulins. Any suitable lyophilization and
reconstitution techniques known in the art are employed. It is appreciated by those
                                             75

    skilled in the art that lyophilization and reconstitution leads to varying degrees of
    antibody activity loss and that use levels are often adjusted to compensate.
    [00234]      Dispersible powders and granules suitable for preparation of an aqueous
   suspension by the addition of water provide the active compound in admixture with a
   dispersing or wetting agent, suspending agent and one or more preservatives.
   Suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents are exemplified by
   those already mentioned above.
   [00235]       In certain aspects, the concentration of OspA in these formulations varies
   widely, for example from less than about 0.5%, usually at or at least about 1% to as
   much as 15 or 20% by weight and will be selected primarily based on fluid volumes,
   viscosities, etc., in accordance with the particular mode of administration selected.
   Thus, for example, and without limitation, a typical pharmaceutical composition for
   parenteral injection is made up to contain 1 ml sterile buffered water, and 50 mg of
   blood clotting factor. A typical composition for intravenous infusion could be made
  up to contain 250 ml of sterile Ringer's solution, and 150 mg of blood clotting factor.
  Actual methods for preparing parenterally administrable compositions are known or
  are apparent to those skilled in the art and are described in more detail in, for
  example, Remington's Pharmaceutical Science, 15th ed., Mack Publishing
  Company, Easton, Pa. (1980). An effective dosage is usually within the range of
  0.01 mg to 1000 mg per kg of body weight per administration.
  [00236        In various aspects, the pharmaceutical compositions are in the form of a
 sterile injectable aqueous, oleaginous suspension, dispersions or sterile powders for
 the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersions. The
 suspension, in some aspects, is formulated according to the known art using those
 suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents which have been
 mentioned above. The sterile injectable preparation, in certain aspects, is a sterile
 injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenterally-acceptable diluent or
solvent, for example as a solution in 1,3-butane diol. In some embodiments, the
carrier is a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol,
polyol (for example, glycerol, propylene glycol, and liquid polyethylene glycol, and
the like), suitable mixtures thereof, vegetable oils, Ringer's solution and isotonic
sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed
as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil is
                                                76

   employed, in various aspects, including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition,
   fatty acids such as oleic acid find use in the preparation of injectables.
   [00237]     In all cases the form must be sterile and must be fluid to the extent that
   easy syringability exists. The proper fluidity is maintained, for example, by the use of
   a coating, such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the
   case of dispersion and by the use of surfactants. It must be stable under the
  conditions of manufacture and storage and must be preserved against the
  contaminating action of microorganisms, such as bacteria and fungi. The prevention
  of the action of microorganisms is brought about by various antibacterial and
  antifungal agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, sorbic acid,
  thimerosal, and the like. In many cases, it will be desirable to include isotonic
  agents, for example, sugars or sodium chloride. In certain aspects, prolonged
  absorption of the injectable compositions is brought about by the use in the
 compositions of agents delaying absorption, for example, aluminum monostearate
 and gelatin.
 [00238]       Compositions useful for administration, in certain aspects, are formulated
 with uptake or absorption enhancers to increase their efficacy. Such enhancers,
 include, for example, salicylate, glycocholate/linoleate, glycholate, aprotinin,
 bacitracin, SDS, caprate and the like. See, e.g., Fix (J Pharm. Sci., 85:1282-1285,
 1996) and Oliyai et al. (Ann. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol., 32:521-544, 1993).
 [00239]      In addition, the properties of hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity of the
 compositions used in the compounds and methods of the invention are well
 balanced, thereby enhancing their utility for both in vitro and especially in vivo uses,
 while other compositions lacking such balance are of substantially less utility.
 Specifically, compositions in the invention have an appropriate degree of solubility in
 aqueous media which permits absorption and bioavailability in the body, while also
 having a degree of solubility in lipids which permits the compounds to traverse the
cell membrane to a putative site of action.
[00240]      In particular aspects, the OspA polypeptides described herein are
formulated in a vaccine composition comprising adjuvant. Any adjuvant known in the
art is used in various aspects of the vaccine composition, including oil-based
adjuvants such as Freund's Complete Adjuvant and Freund's Incomplete Adjuvant,
                                              77

   mycolate-based adjuvants (e.g., trehalose dimycolate), bacterial lipopolysaccharide
   (LPS), peptidoglycans (i.e., mureins, mucopeptides, or glycoproteins such as N
   Opaca, muramyl dipeptide [MDPJ, or MDP analogs), proteoglycans (e.g., extracted
   from Klebsiela pneumoniae), streptococcal preparations (e.g., OK432), Biosti mTM
   (e.g., 01K2), the "Iscoms" of EP 109 942, EP 180 564 and EP 231 039, aluminum
   hydroxide, saponin, DEAE-dextran, neutral oils (such as miglyol), vegetable oils
   (such as arachis oil), liposomes, Pluronic@ polyols, the Ribi adjuvant system (see,
  for example GB-A-2 189 141), or interleukins, particularly those that stimulate cell
   mediated immunity. An alternative adjuvant consisting of extracts of Amycolata, a
  bacterial genus in the order Actinomycetales, has been described in U.S. Patent No.
  4,877,612. Additionally, proprietary adjuvant mixtures are commercially available.
  The adjuvant used depends, in part, on the recipient subject. The amount of
  adjuvant to administer depends on the type and size of the subject. Optimal
  dosages are readily determined by routine methods.
  [00241]     The vaccine composition optionally includes vaccine-compatible
  pharmaceutically acceptable (i.e., sterile and non-toxic) liquid, semisolid, or solid
 diluents that serve as pharmaceutical vehicles, excipients, or media. Any diluent
  known in the art is used. Exemplary diluents include, but are not limited to,
 polyoxyethylene sorbitan monolaurate, magnesium stearate, methyl- and
 propylhydroxybenzoate, talc, alginates, starches, lactose, sucrose, dextrose, sorbitol,
 mannitol, gum acacia, calcium phosphate, mineral oil, cocoa butter, and oil of
 theobroma.
 [00242]      The vaccine composition is packaged in forms convenient for delivery.
 The compositions are enclosed within a capsule, caplet, sachet, cachet, gelatin,
 paper, or other container. These delivery forms are preferred when compatible with
entry of the immunogenic composition into the recipient organism and, particularly,
when the immunogenic composition is being delivered in unit dose form. The
dosage units are packaged, e.g., in tablets, capsules, suppositories, vials, or
cachets.
[00243]      The invention includes methods for inducing an immunological response
in a subject, including OspA antibodies in a mammalian host comprising
administering an effective amount of the Osp A compositions described herein.
Likewise, the invention includes methods for preventing or treating a Borrelia
                                             78

   infection or Lyme disease in a subject, the method comprising the step of
   administering an effective amount of the vaccine compositions described herein to
  the subject.
  [00244]      The vaccine composition is introduced into the subject to be immunized
  by any conventional method as described herein in detail above. In certain aspects,
  the composition is administered in a single dose or a plurality of doses over a period
  of time (as described in more detail below). In some aspects, the terms "dose"and
  "unit dose" are used interchangeably herein.
  Dosing of a Chimeric OspA Composition/Methods for Inducing an
  Immunological Response
  [00245]     The useful dosage of immunogenic composition or vaccine composition to
  be administered will vary depending on various factors which modify the action of
 drugs, e.g. the age, condition, body weight, sex and diet of the subject, the severity
 of any infection, time of administration, mode of administration, and other clinical
 factors.
 [00246]      In some aspects, formulations or compositions of the invention are
 administered by an initial bolus followed by booster delivery after a period of time
 has elapsed. A booster immunization (or "booster"), in some aspects, is important to
 achieve high titers of circulating antibody for protection against the bacteria. In some
 aspects, the compositions of the invention are formulated in a dose or unit dose
 effective to increase Borrelia antibody production to increase geometric mean titer
 (GMT) level of the subject, In some aspects, GMT level is increased to a level of
 about 1,000 to about 10,000 at about 60 days after initial dosing. In further aspects,
 GMT level is increased to a level of about 2,000 to about 30,000 at about 90 days
after initial dosing. In even further aspects, GMT level is increased to greater levels
after administration of a booster. For example, GMT level increased to a level of
about 15,000 to 50,000 after booster administration. In certain aspects, GMT level
increased greater than 50,000 after booster administration. In certain aspects,
formulations of the invention are administered by an initial bolus followed by a
continuous infusion to maintain therapeutic circulating levels of drug product. In
particular aspects, immunogenic compositions or vaccine compositions of the
invention are administered in a vaccination scheme after various periods of time. In
some aspects, the vaccination is delivered in a rapid immunization scheme for
                                            79

   travelers to regions that are prone to Borrelia infection. As another example, the
   composition or formulation of the invention is administered as a one-time dose.
   Those of ordinary skill in the art readily optimize effective dosages and
   administration regimens as determined by good medical practice and the clinical
   condition of the individual subject. The frequency of dosing depends on the
   pharmacokinetic parameters of the agents and the route of administration.
   [00247]      The pharmaceutical formulation is determined by one skilled in the art
   depending upon the route of administration and desired dosage. See for example,
   Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th Ed. (1990, Mack Publishing Co.,
   Easton, PA 18042) pages 1435-1712, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated
  by reference. Such formulations, in some instances, influence the physical state,
  stability, rate of in vivo release, and rate of in vivo clearance of the administered
  composition. Depending on the route of administration, a suitable dose is calculated,
  in particular aspects, according to body weight, body surface area or organ size. In
  some aspects, appropriate dosages are ascertained through use of established
  assays for determining blood level dosages in conjunction with appropriate dose
  response data. In certain aspects, the antibody titer of an individual is measured to
 determine optimal dosage and administration regimens. The final dosage regimen
 will be determined by the attending doctor or physician, considering various factors
 which modify the action of the pharmaceutical compositions, e.g. the composition's
 specific activity, the responsiveness of the subject, the age, condition, body weight,
 sex and diet of the subject, the severity of any infection or malignant condition, time
 of administration and other clinical factors. As studies are conducted, further
 information will emerge regarding the appropriate dosage levels and duration of
treatment for the prevention and/or treatment of relevant conditions.
[00248]        In certain aspects, the OspA immunogenic or vaccine composition
comprises any dose of OspA nucleic acid molecule(s) or polypeptide(s) sufficient to
evoke an immune response in the subject. The effective amount of an OspA
immunogenic or vaccine composition to be employed therapeutically will depend, for
example, upon the therapeutic context and objectives. One skilled in the art will
appreciate that the appropriate dosage levels for vaccination or treatment will thus
vary depending, in part, upon the molecule delivered, the indication for which the
OspA molecule(s) are being used, the route of administration, and the size (body
                                               80

   weight, body surface or organ size) and condition (the age and general health) of the
   patient. Accordingly, the clinician, in some instances, titers the dosage and modifies
   the route of administration to obtain the optimal therapeutic effect.
   [00249]     A typical dosage, in various aspects, ranges from about 0.1 pg/kg to up to
   about 100 mg/kg or more, depending on the factors mentioned above. In other
   embodiments, the dosage may range from 0.1 pg/kg up to about 100 mg/kg; or 1
   pg/kg up to about 100 mg/kg; or 5 pg/kg up to about 100 mg/kg. By way of example,
   a dose of a OspA polypeptide useful in the present invention is approximately 10
   pg/ml, 20 pg/ml, 30 pg/ml, 40 pg/ml, 50 pg/ml, 60 pg/ml, 70 pg/ml, 80 pg/mI, 90
    g/m, 100 pg/ml, 110 pg/ml, 120 pg/ml, 130 pg/ml, 140 pg/m, 150 pg/m, 160 gg/ml,
   170 pg/ml, 180 pg/ml, 190 pg/ml, 200 pg/ml, 210 pg/ml, 220 pg/ml, 230 pg/ml, 240
   pg/ml, 250 pg/ml, 260 pg/ml, 270 pg/ml, 280 pg/ml, 290 pg/ml, 300 pg/ml, 320 gg/ml,
   340 g/ml, 360 pg/ml, 380 pg/ml, 400 pg/m, 420 pg/ml, 440 pg/ml, 460 pg/ml, 480
  pg/ml, 500 pg/ml, 520 pg/ml, 540 pg/ml, 560 pg/ml, 580 pg/ml, 600 pg/ml, 620 g/mI,
  640 pg/ml, Inparticular aspects, a typical dose comprises 0.1 to 5.0 ml per subject.
  Inmore particular aspects, a typical dose comprises 0.2 to 2.0 ml per subject. In
  certain aspects, a dose comprises 0.5 to 1.0 ml per subject.
  [00250]     In more particular aspects, the dose or unit dose administered to a
  subject is about 10 pg, about 20 pg, about 30 pg, about 40 pg, about 50 pg, about
  60 pg, about 70 pg, about 80 pg, about 90 pg, or about 100 pg. Thus, compositions
 and formulations comprising the OspA chimeric polypeptides are designed for easy
 administration of such doses to a subject. In even more particular aspects, the dose
 or unit dose administered per subject is administered once or is administered about
 once a month for two or more months and then, optionally, is followed by a booster.
 In some aspects, the booster is administered at about 2 months, about 3 months,
about 4 months, about 5 months, about 6 months, about 7 months, about 8 months,
about 9 months, about 10 months, about 11 months, about 12 months after the initial
unit dose or the initial multiple unit doses. In some aspects, boosters are
administered about yearly or about once every two or three or four or five or six or
seven or eight or nine years to provide protective immunity.
[00251]      The frequency of dosing will depend upon the pharmacokinetic
parameters of the OspA molecule in the formulation used. Typically, a clinician will
                                             81

    administer the composition until a dosage is reached that achieves the desired
    effect. The composition, in various aspects, is therefore administered as a single
    dose, or as two or more doses (which may or may not contain the same amount of
    the desired molecule) over time, or as a continuous infusion via an implantation
   device or catheter. Further refinement of the appropriate dosage is routinely made
    by those of ordinary skill in the art and is within the ambit of tasks routinely
   performed by them. Appropriate dosages are often ascertained through use of
   appropriate dose-response data which is routinely obtained.
   Kits
   [00252]      As an additional aspect, the invention includes kits which comprise one or
   more pharmaceutical formulations for administration of OspA polypeptide(s) to a
   subject packaged in a manner which facilitates their use for administration to
   subjects.
  [00253]      In a specific embodiment, the invention includes kits for producing a
  single dose administration unit. The kits, in various aspects, each contain both a first
  container having a dried protein and a second container having an aqueous
  formulation. Also included within the scope of this invention are kits containing
  single and multi-chambered pre-filled syringes (e.g., liquid syringes and lyosyringes).
  [00254]      In another embodiment, such a kit includes pharmaceutical formulation
 described herein (e.g., a composition comprising a therapeutic protein or peptide),
  packaged in a container such as a sealed bottle or vessel, with a label affixed to the
 container or included in the package that describes use of the compound or
 composition in practicing the method. In one embodiment, the pharmaceutical
 formulation is packaged in the container such that the amount of headspace in the
 container (e.g., the amount of air between the liquid formulation and the top of the
 container) is very small. Preferably, the amount of headspace is negligible (i.e.,
 almost none).
[00255]       In one aspect, the kit contains a first container having a therapeutic
protein or peptide composition and a second container having a physiologically
acceptable reconstitution solution for the composition. In one aspect, the
pharmaceutical formulation is packaged in a unit dosage form. The kit optionally
further includes a device suitable for administering the pharmaceutical formulation
                                                82

   according to a specific route of administration. In some aspects, the kit contains a
   label that describes use of the pharmaceutical formulations.

  [00258]       Additional aspects and details of the invention will be apparent from the
  following examples, which are intended to be illustrative rather than limiting.

       ANALYSIS OF THE SEQUENCE OF OSPA FROM EUROPEAN BORRELIA
    BURGDORFERI SENSU LATO STRAINS (MOLECULAR EPIDEMIOLOGY) FOR
             THE DETERMINATION OF AN OSPA VACCINE FORMULATION
 [002591       The objective of the study was to determine a suitable formulation for a
 Lyme disease OspA vaccine for Europe. The study was based on sequence
 analysis of the OspA gene (molecular epidemiology) from a large and diverse strain
 collection of B. burgdorferi sensu lato, which adequately represents a broad
 geographic coverage of Europe, the various clinical syndromes associated with
 disease, and each of the three pathogenic genospecies (B. afzelii, B. garinii and B.
 burgdorferi ss) associated with Lyme disease. Lyme disease is caused by Borrelia
 burgdorferi sensu lato, which comprises 13 genospecies in total, three of which (B.
afzeli, B. garinii and B. burgdorferi ss) are recognized as being pathogenic in
humans.
[00260]       At the outset, a large scale epidemiological study (see Table 3 below)
was carried out which evaluated Borrelia burgdoferi sensu lato strains from patients
                                              83

  with Lyme disease (and from ticks) from 21 countries in Europe. A total of 553
  European Borre/ia isolates collected from 16 European countries were studied.
  Each species was determined by PCR using primer sets specific for the 16s rRNA
  genes of each species.
  [00261]     Isolates from each of the three Borrelia species known to cause human
  Lyme disease in Europe were well represented: B. afzelli (n=309, 55.9%), B.
  burgdorferi sensu stricto (n=67, 12.1%), and B. garinii (n=173, 31.3%). Of the 359
  human isolates, 56.8 % were B. afzelij and B. afzelii was the predominant species
 determined from human isolates in most locations. Similarly, B. afzeli was isolated
 from 54.1% of tick isolates. B. burgdorferi s.s. was isolated from 11.7% of human
 strains and 12.9% of tick isolates. B. burgdorferi s.s. was isolated from human
 isolates from South Eastern Europe, notably Italy, Hungary, Slovenia and Austria. B.
 garinii strains were isolated from 30.4% of human isolates and accounted for 33% of
 tick isolates. B. garinii strains isolated from humans and ticks were obtained from
 most of the geographic regions throughout Europe. The data from this study
correlated well with the data presented from other European studies and suggests
that the collection of isolates studied represents an accurate picture of Lyme disease
in Europe.
[00262]      OspA sequencing was carried out to determine an optimal vaccine
formulation for Europe. Based on this data, a vaccine including OspA types 1 to 6
would cover 98.1% of the strains and 96.7% of invasive disease cases.
Epidemiological study results of European Borrelia isolates indicate that a vaccine
based on OspA types 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 would provide theoretical coverage in
Europe of 98% of Lyme disease and 96.7% of invasive neuroborreliosis isolates.

      Serotype 4 is alternatively considered Borrelia bavariensis (See Margos et aL, 1d).
    [00263]        Hence a vaccine comprising three novel recombinant OspAs (1/2, 6/4,
    and 5/3), each representing 2 OspA serotypes, would retain key structural elements
    necessary for protection against all 6 prevalent OspA serotypes (1-6) associated with
    Lyme borreliosis in Europe and against the single OspA serotype associated with
    Lyme borreliosis in the USA.
    [00264]        Inclusion of an OspA 5/3 construct, representing B. garinii OspA
    serotypes 5 and 3, (together with OspA serotypes 1/2 and 6/4), should protect
    against 98.1% of disease and 96.7% of invasive isolates. A vaccine without OspA
    5/3 would be expected to protect against only about 88.9% of disease, and only
    about 73.4% of invasive disease. Thus, a vaccine comprising all six serotypes is
    more effective in the prevention of Lyme disease than a vaccine with only four
   serotypes.
                                                     EXAMPLE 2:
          STRATEGY FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF SYNTHETIC OSPA GENES
                                        ENCODING LIPIDATED OSPA
   [00265]        The aim of the study was to prepare lipidated OspA chimeric constructs
  from several strains of Borrelia in order to make a vaccine that would protect the
                                                           85

    recipient from Lyme disease caused by any of these several strains of Borrelia. The
    general strategy is summarized in Fig. 1 and is described below.
    [00266]     For each novel OspA gene, four sets of oligonucleotides of between 30
   60 bases were synthesized. Each oligonucleotide set consisted of between 8-12
   complementary overlapping oligonucleotides. The oligonucleotides from each set
   were annealed together, in separate experiments, to generate double-stranded DNA
   fragments with specific restriction enzyme recognition sites at either end, i.e.
   fragments N-H (Nde I - Hind ///, H-K (Hind // - Kpn /), K-E (Kpn I - EcoR /) and E-B
   (EcoR /- BamH ). Each of the four fragments was cloned independently into
   pUC1 8, cut with the corresponding restriction enzymes and transformed into the E
   coli host DH5a, after which the sequence of the cloned fragment was verified.
   [00267]      E. coli strain DH5a [genotype: end A1 hsdR17 (rK'mK*) supE44 thi-1
   recA 1gyrA (NaIr) re/A 1A(IacZYA-argF)U 169 deoR (<b80dlacJ(acZ)M15] (Gibco
  BRL) was used for all intermediate cloning steps. This strain is derived from E coli
  strain K12, one of the most widely used hosts in genetic engineering. The strain is
  amp- to allow selection of transformants with vectors containing the ampicillin
  resistance gene (amp). E co/i HMS174(DE3) was selected as the host for
  expression. E coli HMS174(DE3) host cells [genotype : F- recA1 hsdR (rkl2 mkl2)
  RifR (DE3)] (Novagen) were used for the final cloning steps. The strain is kan' to
 allow selection of transformants with vectors containing the kanamycin resistance
 gene (kan).
 [00268]       pUC1 8 (Gibco BRL, Basel, Switzerland) was used as the cloning vector
 for all intermediate steps, because genetic manipulations and sequencing were
 easier with this plasmid than with pET30a. The principal features are notably, the
 lacZ gene fragment coding for LacZ alpha peptide from base pairs 149 to 469 (lac
promoter at base pairs 507), the bla gene encoding the ampicillin resistance
determinant from base pairs 1629 to 2486 (bla promoter at base pairs 2521), the
origin of replication at base pairs 867 and multiple cloning sites from base pairs 185
to 451 (Fig. 12).
[00269]       pET30a (Novagen) was used as the expression vector for the final
complete OspA gene insert. In pET vectors genes are cloned under the control of a
T7 promoter and expression is induced by providing a source of T7 RNA polymerase
                                             86

   in the host cell (no expression occurs until a source of T7 RNA polymerase is
   provided). The principal features are the gene encoding kanamycin resistance (kan)
  at base pairs 4048 to 4860, the lac/ gene base pairs 826 - 1905, the F1 origin of
  replication at base pairs 4956-5411 and multiple cloning sites from base pairs 158 to
  346 (Fig. 13).
  [00270]     The four fragments needed to make a full-length OspA gene were excised
  from a DNA miniprep. DNA was isolated from each of the four clones using the
  same restriction enzymes used for the original cloning step. The DNA fragments
  were purified and ligated together with pUC1 8 DNA cut with Nde 1and BamH land
  were transformed into E coli DH5c competent cells. The full-length OspA gene
  cloned in pUC18 was sequenced to confirm that no errors had been introduced in
 this step.
 [00271]      The OspA gene was then sub-cloned into a pET-30a expression vector
 using the restriction enzymes Nde I and BamH I and transformed into the E. coli host
 HMS 174(DE3). In the pET30a vector, the OspA gene is controlled by the
 bacteriophage T7 promoter.
 [00272]      Three synthetic OspA genes were designed to encode OspA molecules
 with the protective epitopes from serotype 1 and 2 OspAs (ipB sOspA 1/2251),
 serotype 6 and 4 OspAs (lipB sOspA 6/4) and serotype 5 and 3 OspAs (lipB sOspA
5/3) of Borrelia. The primary amino acid sequences of these molecules (SEQ ID
NOS: 2, 4, and 6, respectively) are shown in Figures 2-8 and described herein with a
full description of the main features incorporated into their design.
[00273]      The oligonucleotides for the lipB sOspA 1/2 construct were synthesized
in-house on an ABI 394 DNA/RNA synthesizer, The oligonucleotides for the lipB
sOspA 5/3 and lipB sOspA 6/4 constructs were purchased from GenXpress (Wiener
Neudorf, Austria) and were HPLC purified.

   [00274J     Preparation of E co/i competent cells. A single colony was used to
   inoculate 5 ml modified LB broth (5.5 g NaCI, 5 g yeast extract, 10 g soya peptone,
   which was not obtained from an animal or genetically modified plant source - per liter
   of water). The culture was incubated until it became turbid, after which the culture
  was diluted to a volume of 25 ml with pre-warmed modified LB broth. The culture
  was incubated further until it had reached an OD600nm of 0.2 to 0.6 (40 - 60 min)
  and was diluted to a volume of 125 ml, transferred to a 500 ml flask and incubated
  until an OD600nm of 0.6 was reached. The culture was chilled quickly by gentle
  shaking for 5 min in an ice bath and the cells were pelleted directly (Beckman
  centrifuge, 4000 rpm for 10 min.), washed carefully with TfBI buffer (Teknova
  Hollister, CA) (30 mM K-acetate, 50 mM MnCI2 , 100 mM KCL, 10 mM CaCl2 15%
  glycerol), resuspended in 5 ml of TfBIl (10 mM Na-MOPS, 75 mM CaC 2 , 10 mM
  KCL, 15% glycerol) and held on ice for 15 min. The cells were then pipetted into 100
  pl aliquots and were snap frozen directly in dry ice.
  [002751     Annealing of oligonucleotide mixtures to form OspA gene fragments (de
  novo synthesis). Three synthetic OspA genes were designed to encode OspA
  molecules with the protective epitopes from serotype 1 and 2 OspAs (lipB sOspA
  1/2), serotype 6 and 4 OspAs (lipB sOspA 6/4) and serotype 5 and 3 OspAs (lipB
 sOspA 5/3). For each novel OspA gene (lipidated), four sets of oligonucleotides of
 between 30 - 60 base pairs were synthesized (see Tables 4-6). Figures 16-18 show
 the codon optimized sequences for each of the constructs aligned with the
 nucleotide sequences predicted from published sequences). Each oligonucleotide
 set consisted of between 8-12 complementary overlapping oligonucleotides. The
 oligonucleotides from each set were annealed together, in separate experiments, to
 generate double-stranded DNA fragments with specific restriction enzyme
 recognition sites at either end i.e. fragments N-H (Nde I - Hind Ill), H-K (Hind Il
 Kpn 1), K-E (Kpn I - EcoR 1)and E-B (EcoR I - BamH 1).
[00276J      The lyophilized oligonucleotides were reconstituted with distilled water,
the OD260nm was measured and the concentration was adjusted to 10 pM. For
each OspA fragment, 2 pi of each of the oligonucleotides were mixed together with 1
pl of T4 polynucleotide kinase and T4 DNA ligase buffer (1Ox) and the mixture was
incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes to enable phosphorylation of the
oligos (for the lipB sOspA 6/4 construct this step was omitted as the oligos were
                                            93

   already phosphorylated). The mixture was heated to 95 0Q for 1 minute (denaturing
   step) and then the oligos were allowed to anneal by leaving the mix to cool slowly to
   room temperature. The annealed mix was used directly in ligations, or was stored at
   -20,"C until further needed.
   [00277]      Cloning of OspA gene fragments. Each of the four fragments required for
   constructing an individual synthetic OspA gene was cloned independently into
   pUC18 and transformed into the E. coli host DH5a (see Figure 1).
   [00278]      For each novel OspA gene, four sets of oligonucleotides of between 30
   60 bases were synthesized. Each oligonucleotide set consisted of between 8-12
  complementary overlapping oligonucleotides. The oligonucleotides from each set
  were annealed together, in separate experiments, to generate double-stranded DNA
  fragments with specific restriction enzyme recognition sites at either end, i.e.
  fragments N-H (Nde I - Hind Ill), H-K (Hind III - Kpn I), K-E (Kpn I - EcoR I) and E-B
  (EcoR I - BamH I). Each of the four (4) fragments was cloned independently into
  pUC1 8 cut with the corresponding restriction enzymes and transformed into the E.
  coli host DH5a, after which the sequence of the cloned fragment was verified.
  [00279]      Plasmid DNA (pUC1 8) was purified from an overnight E coli culture (LB
  broth) with a QIAGEN plasmid purification system according to the manufacturer's
  protocol. Vector DNA was then digested with pairs of restriction enzymes; Nde I &
  Hind Ill, Hind Ill & Kpn I, Kpn I & EcoR I, EcoR I & BamH I in accordance with the
  manufacturers' protocols. The digested samples were applied to a 0.8% agarose gel
 and electrophoretically separated. The linearized vector DNA was excised and
 eluted using a commercial gel elution kit (OlAquick Gel Extraction Kit, Qiagen)
 according to the manufacturer's protocol and ligated, using T4 DNA ligase, to the
 annealed oligonucleotide mixture. The ligation products were transformed into
 competent cells of E. coli DH5a and transformants containing the plasmid were
 selected on LB agar containing ampicillin (100 pg/ml).
 [00280]      The presence of the insert of the expected size in the cloning vector,
pUC1 8, was confirmed by purifying plasmid DNA, digesting the DNA with the
enzymes used for cloning and analyzing the DNA fragments by agarose gel
electrophoresis using the procedures previously described. The cloned DNA
fragment was sequenced using purified plasmid DNA as the DNA template and the
                                             94

   sequencing primers 5'-TCGGGGCTGGCTTAACTATG-3 (SEQ ID NO: 14) and 5'
   GCTTCCGGCTCGTAT (SEQ ID NO:15) (which are in the pUC18 vector outside the
   multiple cloning sites, bp 130-150 and bp 530-515, respectively). Sequence
   reactions were run on an automatic sequencer (ABI 310). Sequences were edited
   using SequenceEditor and the sequences were imported into VectorNTI for analysis.
   Only clones with the correct sequences were used as building blocks for constructing
   full-length OspA genes.
   [00281]      For the lipB sOspA 5/3 gene a different strategy was employed, since no
  suitable unique internal site could be found within the Kpn I - BamH I fragment and
  the amino acid sequence did not permit the use of an internal EcoR I site (see Figure
   14). A Pvu II site exists within the Kpn I - BamH I fragment, however there are two
   Pvu II sites in the pUC18 vector which mean direct cloning of the fragments in
  pUC1 8 is not possible. Hence, the oligos for the constructs were designed to have
  an EcoR I site inserted outside and adjacent to the Pvu 1l site, to permit cloning of
  the Kpn I - EcoR I and the EcoR I - BamH I fragments into pUC1 8. Subsequent
  digestion of the inserted fragments with Kpn I, EcoR I and BamH I generated
 fragments, which were subsequently digested with Pvu II. The Pvu l-digested
 fragments (Kpn I -Pvu II and Pvu 1l- BamH I) were then used in a triple ligation with
 pUC1 8 vector DNA cut with Kpn I and BamH I to generate the Kpn I - BamH I
 fragment.
 [00282]       Constructing full-length OspA genes. In the next step, each of the four
 fragments required for constructing an individual synthetic OspA gene was excised
 from the pUC1 8 vector and re-cloned, in a single step, into pUC1 8 vector to generate
 a full-length OspA gene (see Figure 1).
[002831        The four fragments needed to make full-length genes were excised from
miniprep. DNA isolated using the same restriction enzymes used for the original
cloning step. The digested samples were applied to an agarose gel and
electrophoretically separated. The DNA for each of the respective 4 insert fragments
was excised and eluted using a commercial gel elution kit (QiaQuick Gel Extraction
Kit) according to the manufacturer's protocol and ligated, using T4 DNA ligase, to
linearized vector DNA digested with Nde I and BamH I and purified using a QlAquick
Gel Extraction Kit. The ligated DNA was transformed into competent cells of E. coli
DH5a and clones containing the plasmid were selected on LB agar containing
                                              95

    ampicillin (100 pg/ml). Colonies were screened by PCR for the presence of inserts
    of the expected size (approx 830 bp).
    [00284]     Single colonies were used as template DNA in PCR reactions comprising
    1OX buffer (15 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mM KCI, 1.5 mM MgCI 2 ), 200 pM dNTPs,
    1.25 U Amplitaq DNA polymerase, 400 nM forward primer 5'
   TCGGGGCTGGCTTAACTATG-3 (SEQ ID NO: 14) and 400 nM reverse primer 5'
   GCTTCCGGCTCGTAT (SEQ ID NO: 15). PCR reaction conditions were as follows;
   944C for 5 min., 35 x (94*C for 30 s, 48*C for 30 s, 72"C for 1 min 30s) followed by a
   soak at 72"C for 5 minutes and a hold at 40C. PCR products were used directly or
   stored at S -15*C until further use. PCR products were analyzed by agarose gel
   electrophoresis for the presence of inserts of the correct size (approx. 980 bp).
   Inserts of the correct size were sequenced to confirm that no errors had been
  introduced i.e. sequence reactions were set up using plasmid DNA isolated
  (QIAGEN Plasmid Purification kit) from overnight cultures (LB amp broth) and using
  sequencing primers that flank the cloning sites (5'-TCGGGGCTGGCTTAACTATG-3'
  (SEQ ID NO: 14) and 5'-GCTTCCGGCTCGTATGTTGT-3' (SEQ ID NO: 16), bp 130
  150 and 530-510, respectively). Sequence reactions were run on an automatic
  sequencer (ABI 310). Sequences were edited using SequenceEditor and the
  sequences were imported into VectorNTI for analysis.
  [00285]       Sub-cloning of novel OspA genes into the pET30a expression vector.
 Once the full length OspA gene was verified in pUC1 8, the OspA genes were then
 sub-cloned into the pET-30a expression vector using the restriction enzymes Ndel
 and BamH I and transformed into the E coli host HMS 174(DE3).
 [00286]       Miniprep DNA from pUC1 8 clones with the correct sequence was
 digested with Nde I and BamH I. Similarly pET30a vector DNA was digested with
 Nde I and BamH I, The digested DNAs were run on an agarose gel and
electrophoretically separated. The insert fragment of approximately 830 bp and the
linearized vector DNA were excised and purified as described previously. The vector
and insert DNA were ligated, using T4 DNA ligase and the ligation products were
transformed into competent cells of E co/i HMS1 74(DE3) (Novagen). The
transformants were plated onto LB plates containing kanamycin (30 pg/ml). Single
colonies were screened by PCR using the primers 5'
TTATGCTAGTTATTGCTCAGCG-3' (SEQ ID NO: 17) and 5'

   TTCCCCTCTAGAAATAATTTTGT-3' (SEQ ID NO: 18). PCR products were applied

   product of the correct size (approx. 1 kb) were subsequently used to set up overnight
   cultures, from which miniprep DNA was isolated using a QIAGEN Plasmid
   Purification kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. The sequence was again
   confirmed (using primers 5'-TTATGCTAGTTATTGCTCAGCG-3' (SEQ ID NO: 17)
   and 5'-TTCCCCTCTAGAAATAATTTTGT-3' (SEQ ID NO: 18), bp 65-86 and 395

  [00287]       Generating lipB sOspA 1/2"' from IipB sOspA 1/2. A single amino acid
  was changed in the lipB sOspA 1/2 construct, namely amino acid alanine at position
  251 was changed to an asparagine residue, to enhance immunogenicity. The amino
  acid change was introduced by PCR. First, PCR was set up with the external
  forward primer and the internal reverse primer yielding a product of about 730 bp
  with the introduced amino acid change (see Figure 15). Second, PCR was set up
 with the internal forward primer and the external reverse primer to yield a product of
  100 bp containing the introduced amino acid change. The two PCR products, which
 overlapped in sequence, were then used as template DNA in a final PCR reaction
 with the external forward and external reverse primers to yield the final full-length
 OspA product containing the introduced amino acid change.
 [00288]       The pET30a construct was used as the source of template DNA. PCR
 reactions were set up comprising lOX buffer [15 mM Tris-HCI (pH 8.0), 50 mM KCI,
 1.5 mM MgCl2], 200 pm dNTPs, 1.25 U Amplitaq DNA polymerase, and 400 nM of
 each primer pair (primer pair 5'- GGA ATT CCA TAT GCG TCT GTT GAT CGG CT
 (SEQ ID NO: 19) & 5'- TTG GTG CCT GCG GAG TCG (SEQ ID NO:20) and primer
pair 5'- AAT ACG ACT CCG CAG GCA CC (SEQ ID NO: 21) & 5'- CTG-GGA TCC
GCT CAG CTT ATT TCA (SEQ ID NO: 22)). PCR reactions were set up with the
following conditions; 94 0C for 5 min., 35 x (94 0C for 30 s, 48C for 30 s, 72*C for 1
min 30s) followed by a soak at 72*C for 5 minutes and a hold at 40C. The reactions
yielded 2 separate overlapping products and the 2 products were used as the
template DNA in a third PCR reaction using the external primers 5'- GGA ATT CCA
TAT GCG TCT GTT GAT CGG CT (SEQ ID NO: 19) and 5'- CTG-GGA TCC GCT
CAG CTT ATT TCA (SEQ ID NO: 22) which incorporated restriction sites for Nde I
and BamH 1. The reaction conditions were 94"C for 60 sec followed by 35 cycles of
                                            97

    (30 sec 940C, 60 sec 49*C, 90 sec 72*C) followed by 72*C for 5 min. The amplified
   product was purified with a QiaQuick purification kit (Qiagen) in accordance with the
   manufacturer's specifications and the product was digested with Nde I and BamH I
   and ligated to pET30a vector DNA cut Nde I and BamH . The ligation products were
   transformed into competent cells of E coli DH5a. The transformants were plated
   onto LB plates containing kanamycin (30 pg/ml). Single colonies were screened by
   PCR using the primers 5'-TTATGCTAGTTATTGCTCAGCG-3' (SEQ ID NO: 17) and
   5'-TTCCCCTCTAGAAATAATTTTGT-3' (SEQ ID NO: 18). PCR products were
   applied to an agarose gel and were electrophoretically separated. Colonies which
   yielded a product of the correct size (approx. 1 kb) were subsequently used to set up
   overnight cultures, from which miniprep DNA was isolated using a QIAGEN Plasmid
   Purification System according to the manufacturer's protocol. The sequence was
  confirmed (using primers 5'-TTATGCTAGTTATTGCTCAGCG-3' (SEQ ID NO: 17)
  and 5-TTCCCCTCTAGAAATAATTTTGT-3' (SEQ ID NO: 18)) and the resulting
  construct was transformed into E co/i HMS174 (DE3) competent cells and the
  resulting positive transformants were given the name lipB sOspA 1/2251.
  [00289]      Generation of constructs without leader sequence. Constructs were
 prepared with a lipB leader sequence, to which a lipid moiety is typically attached at
 the amino terminal cysteine residue. Experimental testing of the recombinant
 lipidated OspAs verified the presence of a lipid moiety. However, constructs which
 did not contain the lipB leader sequence were also prepared. Constructs which did
 not contain the lipB leader sequence were made by PCR amplification from each of
 the three lipB constructs (in pET30a) using primers selected to generate a final
 product of 769-771 bp without the nucleic acid sequence coding for the leader
sequence and with the codon for the cysteine residue replaced with a codon for a
methionine residue.
[00290]       PCR reactions comprised 1OX buffer [15 mM Tris-HCI (pH 8.0), 50 mM
KCI, 1.5 mM MgCl2], 200 pm dNTPs, 1.25 U Amplitaq DNA polymerase, 400 nM
forward primer 5'-CGTGCGTACCATATGGCACAGAAAGGTGCTGAGTCT-3'                         (SEQ
ID NO: 23) and 400 nM reverse primer 5'-CTGGGATCCGCTCAGCTTATTTCA-3'
(SEQ ID NO: 22) and template DNA. PCR conditions were; 94*C for 5 min, 35 x
(94 C for 30 s, 48 C for 30 s, 72*C for 1 min 30 s) followed by a soak at 72*C for 5
                                            98

    min and a hold at 40C. PCR reactions were used directly or stored at        15CC until
   further use.
   [00291]      The PCR products were purified using a QiaQuick PCR purification kit
   (Qiagen), were digested with Nde I and BamH I and were ligated to pET30a vector
   DNA digested with Nde I and BamH . The ligation mixes were used to transform E.
   coli HMS1 74 (DE3) and colonies containing recombinant plasmids were selected by
   their resistance to kanamycin and the sequence was verified from PCR products.
   [00292]     Evaluation of expression in E. coli HMS 174(DE3). Selected colonies
   were tested for their ability to express the respective novel OspA protein. In each
   case, single colonies were used to inoculate LB broth containing kanamycin (30
   pg/ml) and were incubated at 370C for 1 to 5 hours until an OD (600 nm) value
   greater than 0.6 and less than 1 was reached. At this point, a sample of the culture
   was retained (representing the un-induced sample) and the remainder of the culture
  was induced by the addition of IPTG to a final concentration of 1 mM. The un
  induced sample (1 ml) was centrifuged and the pellet retained and stored at -20C.
  The induced culture was allowed to grow for a further three hours, after which a 1 ml
  sample was taken, the OD (600 nm) was measured, the sample centrifuged and the
  pellet retained and stored at -20 "C.
  [00293]      Preparation of primary ce/Is. Primary cells were prepared for each of the
  three lipidated constructs and for each of the three non-lipidated constructs. The
  primary cells comprised E coli cells (HMS1 74 (DE3)) carrying a pET30a plasmid
 expressing the respective OspA. For preparation of primary cells, a single colony
 from the respective stock was picked from a plate containing kanamycin (30 pg/ml)
 and rifampicin (200 pg/ml) and was used to inoculate 500 pl of SMK medium (SOP
 8114) and incubated overnight. One hundred microliters of this culture was then
 used to inoculate 100 ml of SMK medium (in duplicate) and the culture was
 incubated for 17 to 20 hours at 370C shaking. Sterile glycerol was then added to the
 culture at a final concentration of 15% and the material was pipetted in aliquots in
500 pl amounts into 60 ampoules, thus yielding 60 ampoules of primary cells which
were directly stored at -80*C.
[00294]       Three synthetic OspA genes were designed to encode OspA molecules
with the protective epitopes from serotype I and 2 OspAs (lipB sOspA 1/2251),
                                              99

  serotype 6 and 4 OspAs (lipB sOspA 6/4) and serotype 5 and 3 OspAs (lipB sOspA
  5/3). The primary amino acid sequences of these molecules and a description of the
  main features incorporated into their design are set out in the following Examples.

           DESCRIPTION OF LIPIDATED 1/2251 OSPA (LIPB SOSPA1/2               25 1
                                                                                  )
  [00295]    The aim of the study was to design a novel OspA antigen, lipidated 1/2   251
  OspA (lipB sOspA 1/2251), comprising serotypes 1 and 2. LipB sOspA 1/2251,
  comprises the proximal portion of a serotype 1 OspA sequence (Strain B31,
  GenBank Accession No. X1 4407) fused to the distal portion of a serotype 2
 sequence (Strain Pko, GenBank Accession No. S48322). The start of the sequence
 unique to the type 2 serotype is the lysine (K) residue at position 216. The construct
 was originally designed to encode the amino acid alanine (A) at position 251.
 However, the construct was subsequently altered by PCR to encode an asparagine
 (N) residue (the actual residue in the published sequence from Pko) to enhance
 immunogenicity, hence the nomenclature lipB sOspA 1/2.
 [00296]    Secondary features of IipB sOspA 1/2251 are shown in the annotated
 amino acid sequence of lipB sOspA 1/2251 in Figure 2 and include:
        0      the replacement of the putative arthritogenic epitope (Gross et al.,
 1998), hLFA-1 (YVLEGTLTA) (SEQ ID NO:24), in the proximal portion of the
 molecule (amino acids 161 to 185) with an equivalent sequence (shown in italics and
a flanking sequence) from a serotype 2 OspA sequence (Strain Pko; GenBank
Accession No. S48322): a sequence that is distinct from the hLFA-1 epitope;
        *      an OspB leader sequence (amino acids I to 15 of Figure 2) and
various substitutions to avoid prior art. The asparagine (N) and aspartic acid (D)
residues at positions 44 and 46 were replaced with an aspartic acid (D) and an
asparagine (N), respectively, to produce the sequence KEKDKN (SEQ ID NO: 25).
The alanine (A) and aspartic acid (D) residues at positions 78 and 79 were replaced
with a threonine (T) and an asparagine (N), respectively, to produce the sequence
KTNKSK (SEQ ID NO: 26);
        6     stabilizing mutations as described in international patent publication
number WO 02/16421A2 (Luft & Dunn). For example, methionine (M) replaced
                                           100

   arginine (R) at amino acid 136 (R139M); tyrosine (Y) replaced glutamic acid (E)at
   amino acid 157 (E160Y); and methionine (M) replaced lysine (K) at amino acid 186
   (K189M); and
           0      additional stabilizing mutations. For example, threonine (T) replaced
   valine (V) at amino acid 173 (aa 176 of the disclosure). The removal of the putative
   arthritogenic epitope (position 161-185), by replacing a B. burgdorferi sequence with
   a B. afzelii sequence, disrupted the hydrogen bonding between amino acids 173 and
   174 (aa 176 and 177 of the disclosure). This led to decreased binding to protective
   monoclonal antibodies (105.5 and LA-2 (Jiang et al., J. Immunol. 144: 284-9, 1990;
   Golde et al., Infect. Immun. 65: 882-9, 1997; and Ding et al., J. MoL Biol 302: 1153
  64, 2000). A threonine (T) was introduced at position 173, instead of a valine (V), to
  restore the hydrogen bond and increase reactivity to protective monoclonal
  antibodies 105.5 and LA2.
  [00297]      In addition, amino acids 16-25 (start of the mature protein) are identical to
  the OspB sequence (GenBank Accession No. X7481 0).
  [00298]      The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of lipB sOspA 1/2251
 are shown in Figure 3. The leader sequence (green) is cleaved off during protein
 secretion. The sequence of the mature OspA protein starts with a cysteine residue
 (underlined), which forms the attachment site for the protein's lipid anchor.

               DESCRIPTION OF LIPIDATED 6/4 OSPA (LIPB SOSPA 6/4)
 [00299]      The aim of the study was to design a novel OspA antigen, lipidated
sOspA 6/4 OspA (ipB sOspA 6/4), comprising serotypes 4 and 6. LipB sOspA 6/4
comprises the proximal portion of a serotype 6 OspA sequence (Strain K48,
GenBank Accession No. 140098) fused to the distal portion of a serotype 4 sequence
(Strain pTroB; GenBank Accession No. 140089). The start of the sequence unique to
the type 4 serotype is the asparagine (N) residue at position 217. Secondary
features are shown in the annotated amino acid sequence of lipB sOspA 6/4 in
Figure 4 and include:
                 stabilizing mutations described in International Patent Application No.
WO 02/16421A2 (Luft and Dunn): methionine (M) instead of an arginine (R) at amino

    acid 136, tyrosine (Y) instead of a glutamic acid (E) at amino acid 157, and
    methionine (M) instead of a lysine (K) at amino acid 187; and
           a      like lipB sOspA 1/2251, described above, an OspB leader sequence was
    used (amino acids 1 to 15 in Figure 4) and amino acids 16-25 are identical to
    sequence from OspB (GenBank Accession No. X74810).
    [00300]    Although the peptide sequence KEKNKD (SEQ ID NO: 27) was absent
   from the parent OspA type 6 sequence (KEKDKD) (SEQ ID NO: 28), the aspartic
   acid (D) residue at position 46 was replaced with an asparagine residue (N) in
   conformity with an equivalent change made in the lipB sOspA 1/2251 construct to
   produce the sequence KEKDKN (SEQ ID NO:25).
   [00301]     Although the peptide sequence KADKSK (SEQ ID NO:29) was absent
  from the parent OspA type 6 sequence (KTDKSK) (SEQ ID NO: 30), the aspartic
  acid (D) residue at position 79 was replaced with an asparagine residue (N) in
  conformity with an equivalent change made in the lipB sOspA 1/2251 construct to
  produce the sequence KTNKSK (SEQ ID NO:26).
  [00302]     Amino acid 37 was changed from the glutaminc acid (E), as present in the
  parent sequence (Strain K48; GenBank Accession No. 140098), to a valine (V),
  because almost all type 6 sequences have a valine in this position.
  [00303]     The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of lipB sOspA 6/4 are
 shown in Figure 5. The leader sequence (green) is cleaved off during protein
 secretion. The sequence of the mature OspA protein starts with a cysteine residue
 (underlined, see Figure 5), which forms the attachment site for the protein's lipid
 anchor.

 [00304]      The aim of the study was to design a novel OspA antigen, lipidated
sOspA 5/3 OspA (lipB sOspA 5/3), comprising serotypes 3 and 5. LipB sOspA 5/3
comprises the proximal portion of a serotype 5 OspA sequence [Database Accession

     The start of the sequence unique to the type 3 serotype is the aspartic acid (D)
     residue at position 216. Secondary features are shown in the annotated amino acid
     sequence of lipB sOspA 5/3 in Figure 6 and include:

    methionine (M) instead of a lysine (K) at amino acid 187; and
           *       like lipB sOspA 1/2251 and lipB sOspA 6/4, described above, an OspB
    leader sequence was used (amino acids 1 to 15 in Figure 6) and amino acids 16-25
    are identical to sequence from OspB (GenBank Accession No. X7481 0).
   [00305]      Although the peptide sequence KEKNKD (SEQ ID NO:27) was absent
   from the parent OspA type 5 sequence (KEKDKD) (SEQ ID NO: 28), the aspartic
   acid (D) residue at position 46 was replaced with an asparagine residue (N) in
   conformity with an equivalent change made in the lipB sOspA 1/2251 construct giving
   the sequence KEKDKN (SEQ ID NO:25).
   [00306]     Although the peptide sequence KADKSK (SEQ ID NO:29) was absent
  from the parent OspA type 5 sequence (KTDKSK) (SEQ ID NO: 30), the aspartic

  conformity with an equivalent change made in the IipB sOspA 1/2251 construct
  giving the sequence KTNKSK (SEQ ID NO: 26).
  [00307]      The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of lipB sOspA 5/3 are
  shown in Figure 7. The leader sequence (green) is cleaved off during protein
 secretion. The sequence of the mature OspA protein starts with a cysteine codon
 (underlined, see Figure 7), which forms the attachment site for the protein's lipid
 anchor.
                                          EXAMPLE 6:
  OPTIMIZATION OF CODON USAGE FOR HIGH LEVEL EXPRESSION IN E. COLI
 [003081      Because the presence of codons that are rarely used in E. co/i is known
to present a potential impediment to high-level expression of foreign genes, low
usage codons were replaced with codons which are used by highly expressed genes
in E. coli. The nucleotide sequences of the novel OspA genes were designed to
                                              103

    utilize the coons found most frequently (preferred codons) among the highly
    expressed class II, E coligenes (Guerdoux-Jamet et. al, DNA Research 4:257
    65,1997). The data for codon usage among the novel OspA genes and for the highly
   expressed class Il E. coligenes are summarized in Tables 7 and 8. The data for the
   less frequent amino acids for which tRNA molecules are less likely to be rate limiting
   is presented separately (Table 7) from the data for the amino acids which occur most
   often (Table 8).

  [00309]    The high degree of concordance between codon usage chosen for the
 novel OspA genes (common amino acids only) and among E co/i class I genes is
 apparent (i.e. plot of percentage figures from Table 8 for class If genes against
 individual novel OspA genes; see Figure 8). For the three lipidated constructs, the
 original sequences had a GC content ranging from 32.8% to 33.8%, while the codon
 optimized sequences had a GC content ranging from 43.8% to 46.8%, which is
similar to the 50% GC content of E coli.

             CONSTRUCTION OF SYNTHETIC NON-LIPIDATED OSPA GENES
   [00310]      Constructs were also prepared which did not contain the lipB leader
   sequence. The two sets of constructs (lipidated and non-lipidated) are needed to
   evaluate their ease of production in the fermentor (biomass, stability, product yield,
   and the like), to assess how readily the different types of antigen can be purified and
   to compare their biological characteristics (safety profile and protective potency).
   [00311]      The constructs (SEQ ID NOS: 7, 9, and 11) were generated by PCR
   amplification from each of the three lipB OspA constructs (SEQ ID NOS: 1, 3, and 5)
   using PCR primers with incorporated restriction sites. The PCR products were
   purified, digested with Nde I and BamH I and ligated to digested pET30a vector
   DNA. The ligation mixes were used to transform E. co/i DH5c         and the OspA
  sequences were verified. Miniprep DNA was prepared, isolated, and used to
  transform HMS 174(DE3) host cells. The sequences of the non-lipidated derivatives
  are identical to the lipidated versions, except they lack the first 45 base pairs coding
  for the leader sequence and contain an Nde I site which contains a methionine
  codon which replaces the cysteine codon in the lipidated versions (see Figure 9).

               EXPRESSION OF NOVEL RECOMBINANT OSPA ANTIGENS
 [00312]       To express/produce the novel recombinant OspA genes for antigenic
 purposes, an E. coli expression system controlled by the bacteriophage T7 RNA
 polymerase (Studier et al., J. Mol. Biol. 189:113-30, 1986) was used. In this
 expression system, the novel OspA genes were cloned into the multiple cloning site
 in one of the pET series of plasmids (e.g., pET30a). Because expression of the
foreign gene is under the control of a bacteriophage T7 promoter, which is not
recognized by E. co/i RNA polymerase, expression is dependent on a source of T7
RNA polymerase. This enzyme is provided when the recombinant plasmids are
transferred into an appropriate expression host, such as E. coli HMS174(DE3),
which contains a chromosomal copy of the T7 RNA polymerase gene. Expression of
the chromosomally integrated T7 RNA polymerase gene is under control of a lacUV5
promoter, which can be switched on (i.e. induced) by the addition of isopropyl P-D-1
                                             106

   thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) or lactose (see Figure 10). Consequently, expression
   of the foreign gene is also regulated by the addition of the inducer molecule.
   [00313]     The cells were induced at late log-phase and harvested 3-4 hours after
  induction. In induced cells, the chimeric OspA antigen was the most highly
  expressed protein as determined by SDS-PAGE of cell lysates. Most of the OspA
  chimeras were found in the supernatant. Contaminating E. coli proteins were
  removed by anion-exchange chromatography and the chimeric OspA proteins eluted
  in the void volume were concentrated by ultrafiltration.
  [00314]      The expression of the novel recombinant OspA proteins from each of the
  constructs was tested, and samples from induced and un-induced cultures were run
  on an SDS polyacrylamide gel (Figure 11). For the lipidated (SEQ ID NOS: 2, 4, and
  6) and non-lipidated (SEQ ID NOS: 8, 10, and 12) antigens, a band of approximately
  31 kDa was observed in each case (see Figure 11). The proteins were
  characterized and the molecular weights determined correlated (+/- 0.5 daltons) with
 the theoretical molecular weights assuming the terminal methionine is cleaved off.
  Figure 11 shows that the expressed recombinant lipidated OspA proteins comprise
 at least 10% of the total protein yield, verifying that the constructs are useful for their
 intended purpose.

        A SINGLE RECOMBINANT OSPA ANTIGEN (R OSPA 1/2) PROTECTS
         AGAINST INFECTION WITH B. BURGDORFERI S.S. AND B. AFZELII
 [00315]      The purpose of this study was to determine if a single recombinant
antigen (rOspA 1/2; the polypeptide comprising SEQ ID NO: 2 (lipB sOspA 1/2251)),
designed to retain the protective properties of OspA serotypes 1 and 2, is able to
induce antibody responses which protect mice against infection with either
B.burgdorferis.s. (OspA serotype 1) or B afzeli (OspA serotype 2). Evidence is
provided to show that the inclusion of additional rOspA antigens did not have an
antagonistic effect on the protective immunity afforded by the rOspA 1/2 antigen.
[00316]       Design and construction of rOspA 1/2. To eliminate the risk of introducing
adventitious agents, complementary overlapping synthetic oligonucleotides were
used to generate DNA fragments that were ligated together and cloned into vector
                                            107

   pET30a and the sequence was verified. This approach also enabled codon usage to
   be optimized for the E. coli host HMS1 74 (DE3) used to express the OspA gene.
   The novel gene is based on the proximal portion of a serotype-1 OspA sequence
   (amino acids 29 to 218, Strain B31; GenBank Accession Number X14407) fused to
   the distal portion of a serotype-2 sequence (amino acids 219 to 273, Strain PKo;
  Accession Number S48322). The 25 amino acid fragment from B. burgdorferistrain
   B31 (aa 164 to 188) was replaced with sequence from B. afzeli strain PKo (aa 164
  to 188) because this region of the B31 OspA (aa 165-173) is highly related to the
  region encompassing the hLFA-1 epitope (aa 332-340). The N-terminal sequence
  including the leader sequence and the first 11 amino acids were derived from OspB
  (Strain B31; GenBank Accession Number X74810) in order to optimize lipidated
  protein expression. Other specific amino acid changes were made to improve the
  immunogenicity and conformational stability of the rOspA 1/2 molecule and the
  sequence of rOspA 1/2 (lipB sOspA 1/2251) is set out in SEQ ID NO: 2.
 [00317]       Animal testing. The ability of a single recombinant OspA antigen (rOspA
  1/2) to prevent infection with two species of Borrelia, which express different OspA
 antigens, was assessed in C3H/HeJ mice immunized subcutaneously (days 0 and
 28) with purified OspA antigen (0.1 pg or 0.03pg doses) formulated with 0.2% (w/v)
 aluminum hydroxide as adjuvant. Mice were challenged 2 weeks after the booster
 immunization, either by intradermal injection (needle challenge; 7 x 104 cells) or by
 the natural route of infection (tick challenge). For the latter experiments, 8 nymphal
 ticks were applied per mouse and allowed to feed for up to 5 days. The nymphs
 were collected in the vicinity of Budweis (Czech Republic), an area endemic for
 Lyme disease. The majority of these ticks were infected with B. afzeliias determined
 by testing unfed ticks by PCR. The infectious status of the mice was determined four
weeks later. In the tick challenge experiments, the presence of Borrelia was
 confirmed by culture (urinary bladder) and by detection of Borrelia DNA by real-time
 PCR (heart). Animal experiments were conducted in accordance with Austrian laws
on animal experimentation and international guidelines (AAALAC and OLAW) and
were reviewed by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and approved by
the Austrian regulatory authorities. Immunogenicity. The antibody response (pg
IgG/ml) to rOspA 1/2 antigen was determined by ELISA using rOspA 1/2 as the
                                             108

   coating antigen and an OspA specific monoclonal antibody (prepared in house) with
   a defined IgG content as a standard.
   [00318]     Diagnostic procedures. For the needle challenge experiments, the
  presence of antibodies to a conserved epitope in the surface-exposed lipoprotein
  VIsE protein (C6 ELISA; coated plates from Immunetics@ C6 Lyme ELISA TM) or to
  Borrelia antigens other than the OspA immunogen (Western blotting) was used to
  diagnose infection. Western blotting used a cell lysate prepared from B. burgdorferi
  s.s. strain ZS7 as this was the challenge organism. Animals were deemed infected if
  they were positive in both assays.
  [00319]      For the tick challenge experiments, the C6 ELISA and Western blotting
 were also done. However, Western blotting used lysates from B. burgdorferi s.s.
 ZS7, B. afze~liACA1 and B. garinii KL1 1, because the identity of the infecting
 organism was unknown. Animals were considered to have undergone
 seroconversion only if both assays were positive. In addition, Borrelia infection was
 assessed by culture from the urinary bladder and by detection of B.burgdorferi s.
 nucleic acids in genomic DNA extracted from heart tissue using a real-time PCR
 assay targeting the 5'-region of OspA and a 16S rRNA gene-based assay. Animals
 were scored as PCR-positive only if a PCR product was detected with both assays.
 Overall, to judge an animal as infected, mice needed to be positive either by culture,
 PCR or serology.
 [00320J      Characterization of infecting Borrelia. Where possible, the infecting
 organism was cultured and the OspA sequence and deduced amino acid sequence
determined for OspA residues 38-262 (B. atzeli VS461, GenBank Accession
 Number Z29087). This information was compared to OspA reference sequences so
that the OspA type and Borrelia species could be inferred. For species which
express a single OspA serotype, the OspA sequence for the type strain for the
species was chosen as a reference, e.g., B. afzelii VS461 or B. valaisiana VS1 16
(GenBank Accession Number Z29087; AF095940). As B. garinii has multiple OspA
types, OspA sequences for OspA genotypes 3-7 were used (i.e. strains PBr, PTrob,
WABSou, TIsl and T25; GenBank Accession Numbers X80256, X80186, X85441,
X85440 and X80254, respectively). For real-time PCR-based typing, sequence
alignments of the OspA gene of 124 B. burgdorferi s.L species deposited in
GenBank were inspected for serotype-specific sequences and suitable primer-probe
                                            109

     combinations were designed using Primer Express 3.0 (Applied Biosystems). All
     assays were run on an ABI Prism 7900HT sequence detection unit using universal
     cycling conditions.
     [00321]     Prevention of B.burgdorferi s.s (OspA serotype- 1) infection by
     immunization with rOspA 1/2. All of the mice immunized with low doses of two
    different lots of the rOspA 1/2 antigen developed IgG antibodies specific for the
    immunogen as determined by ELISA. No antibodies were detected in the control
    mice which had been treated with vaccine formulation buffer containing aluminum
    hydroxide. To assess the ability of this immune response to prevent infection with B.
    burgdorferis.s., a species that encodes a serotype-1 OspA, the mice were injected
   intradermally with 7 x 104 cells of B. burgdorferi s.s. strain ZS7. All of the control
   mice treated with buffer containing adjuvant showed serological evidence of infection
   as demonstrated by C6 ELISA and by Western blotting. None of the mice
   immunized with the rOspA 1/2 antigen became infected and the sera from these
   mice were negative by both assays. As little as 0.03pg of the rOspA 1/2 antigen,
  when formulated with aluminum hydroxide as adjuvant and administered in a two
  dose immunization regimen, conferred 100% protection (P < 0.0001, Fisher exact
  two tailed test) against a needle challenge with the virulent B. burgdorferi s.s. strain
  ZS7.
  [00322]       Prevention of B. afzelii (OspA serotype-2) infection by immunization with
  rOspA 1/2. To assess the ability of immunization with the rOspA 1/2 antigen to
 prevent infection with B. afzeli, a species that encodes a serotype-2 OspA, mice
 were immunized, in two separate experiments, with the same antigen lots and study
 design as used in the needle challenge experiment described above. However, in
 this case, the immunized mice were challenged with feral ticks (nymphs) known to
 be infected mainly with B. afzelfi. The ability of these feral ticks to transmit B.
 burgdorferi s.. to mice was confirmed by challenging non-immunized control
animals.
[00323]        Most of the control mice (total 11/14, 79%) became infected. All infected
control animals were positive for Borrelia DNA by two independent real-time PCR
assays (16S rRNA and OspA genes). In 10/11 cases, it was possible to isolate
Borrelia by culture of the urinary bladder. The remaining mouse was positive by
serology and PCR. For 9 of the 10 culture isolates, OspA sequences were retrieved
                                              110

   and all were typed as B. afzelii (> 99% OspA sequence identity). Furthermore, all
  infecting organisms were typed as B. afzelii by PCR analysis of the DNA extracted
  from the heart using a real-time PCR assay specifically targeting serotype 2 OspA
  genes. These data confirm that B. afzelii was the principal Borrelia species being
  transmitted from the infected feral ticks to their mouse host.
  [00324]     Few of the mice immunized with rOspA 1/2 (total 3/32, 9%) became
  infected. Of these three mice, one was infected as determined by all three
  diagnostic criteria (serology, PCR and culture) and sequence analysis revealed that
  the infecting organism was B. gariniiserotype-6 (> 99% OspA sequence identity).
  The remaining two animals deemed infected were positive by only two of the three
  criteria. One mouse was positive by serology and PCR. However, the infecting
  organism could not be retrieved in culture. Nevertheless, this organism could be
 typed as B. garini serotype-7 by PCR analysis of the DNA extracted from the heart
  using PCR specific for the serotype-7 OspA gene. The third mouse was PCR and
 culture positive but serologically negative. The isolate cultured from this mouse was
 B. valaisiana as determined by sequencing (OspA sequence identity with B.
  valaisiana strain VS1 16). Importantly, none of the immunized mice (0/32) became
 infected with B. afzeii. As little as 0.03pg of the rOspA 1/2 antigen, when formulated
 with aluminum hydroxide as adjuvant and administered in a two dose immunization
 regimen, conferred full protection against B. afzelii transmitted by feral ticks.
 [00325]      Conclusion. A single recombinant outer surface protein A (OspA) antigen
 designed to contain protective elements from two different OspA serotypes (1 and 2)
 was able to induce antibody responses which protect mice against infection with
 either B. burgdorferisensu stricto (OspA serotype-1) or B. afzelii (OspA serotype-2).
 Protection against infection with B. burgdorferi s.s. strain ZS7 was demonstrated in a
 needle challenge model. Protection against B. afzell species was shown in a tick
challenge model using feral ticks. In both models, as little as 0.03pg of antigen,
when administered in a two dose immunization schedule with aluminum hydroxide
as adjuvant, was sufficient to provide complete protection against the species
targeted. As anticipated, the protection afforded by this novel antigen did not extend
to other Borrelia species as demonstrated by the antigen's inability to provide
protection against infection with B. garinil and B. valaisiana strains. This proof of
principle study proves that knowledge of protective epitopes can be used for the
                                            111

   rational design of effective, genetically-modified vaccines requiring fewer OspA
   antigens and suggests that this approach may facilitate the development of an OspA
   vaccine for global use.

    EFFICIENCY OF MOUSE ANTI-OSPA ANTIBODIES TO BIND TO THE SURFACE
    OF LIVE BORRELIA OR TO INHIBIT GROWTH THEREOF CORRELATES WITH
                 PROTECTION AGAINST NEEDLE CHALLENGE USING
                         A B. BURGDORFERI S.S. TYPE 1 STRAIN
   [00326]    The purpose of this study was to establish correlates of protection for
   mice immunized with the rOspA 1/2 antigen in a needle challenge model using a
  Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto OspA type 1 strain. Parameters analyzed were the
  potency of anti-OspA antibodies to bind to the surface of live Borreliae or to inhibit
  growth of Borreliae.
  [00327]     98 mice were deliberately immunized with a sub-optimal 3 ng dose of the
  rOspA 1/2 antigen adjuvanted with 0.2% AI(OH)3), which was 10-fold lower than the
  lower dose used in Example 9, in a prime-booster regimen so that, upon challenge,
  both protected and infected animals would be observed. Vaccination was carried out
  subcutaneously using a dose volume of 100 pl on days 0, 14 and 28. On day 38,
 pre-challenge sera samples were taken from 96 mice, and animals were challenged
  10 days later with 19.4 x ID50 of culture grown B.burgdorferi s.s. ZS7, and infection
 status was determined after four weeks. 71 of the 96 mice (72%) were found to be
 protected after immunizing with this low dose of antigen.
 [00328]      Four weeks post-challenge blood was taken to identify infected mice by
 Western blotting their sera against a membrane fraction of B.burgdorferis.s. strain
ZS7. At the challenge doses used, only infected mice had an antibody response to
 membrane antigens of strain ZS7 other than OspA (the response to OspA, induced
by vaccine, was not scored).
[00329]       Quantitation of OspA antibody binding to the surface of live Borreliae. In
this assay, B. burgdorferi s.s. strain B31 expressing OspA types 1 were incubated at
a fixed dilution (1:100) with the pre-challenge mouse sera at room temperature in the
presence of EDTA to prevent complement activation. After washing to remove
                                             112

   unbound antibody, antibodies that were specifically bound to the cell surface were
   labeled by incubating the treated cells with an r-Phycoerythrin-conjugated anti
   mouse Ig polyclonal antibody. Subsequently, a DNA stain (LDS-751) that emits red
   fluorescence, thereby enhancing detection, was used, and bacteria were then
   analyzed by flow cytometry (FACSCalibur, Beckton-Dickinson). The fluorescence
   intensity, which correlates with the number of antibody molecules attached to the cell
   surface, was recorded for at least 2,000 individual Borreliae, and the mean of the
  fluorescence intensities (MFI) was calculated. Normal mouse serum served as the
  negative control to evaluate the extent of non-specific surface binding of antibodies,
  while an OspA serotype 1-specific mAb served as a positive control to confirm the
  identity of the OspA type and to verify the level of OspA expression of the cells in the
  bacterial culture.
  [00330]      A bacterial growth inhibition assay. To measure the potency of the pre
  challenge sera to inhibit growth of the Borreliae, B. burgdorferis.s. strain B31
 expressing OspA type 1 was cultured at 33C in the presence of serial dilutions of
  heat-inactivated pre-challenge or non-immune mouse serum (negative control) in the
 presence of complement (normal guinea pig serum). When the bacteria in the
 control cultures incubated with non-immune sera had grown sufficiently, as
 determined microscopically, accurate cell counts were made by flow cytometric
 analysis. Cell cultures were mixed with a solution containing a defined number of
 fluorescence-labeled beads and a DNA-dye was added to fluorescently label the
 Borrelia cells. Samples were processed using a FACSCalibur Flow cytometer until
 100 beads were counted, and the absolute cell concentrations were calculated
 (cells/ml) by comparing the numbers of events in the gate defining the beads and in
the gate defining the Borreliae. The serum dilution that inhibited bacterial growth by
50% was calculated in comparison to the NMS control and reported as GI-50 titer. A
standard serum preparation was used to normalize titers between different assays.
Distribution of the measured serum parameters were compared among infected and
protected animals by the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test (Graphpad Prism
Vers. 5.0).
[00331]       Results of this study (see Figure 19) clearly demonstrate that a highly
significant correlation exists between the functional antibody content of the immune
serum at the time of challenge and protection against infection with a high dose (19.4
                                             113

   x ID5o) needle challenge of B. burgdorferi s.s. (ZS7). FACS -based fluorescence
   intensity measurements of live Borreliae expressing OspA type 1, which reflects the
   number of anti-OspA antibody molecules attached to the cell surface, carried out
   after incubation of the bacteria with the pre-challenge sera at a fixed dilution,
   correlated best with protection (p <0.0001 Mann-Whitney U test). However, growth
   inhibition titers also correlated highly significantly with protection (p =0.0002 Mann
   Whitney U test, Figure 19).

    EFFICIENCY OF MOUSE ANTI-OSPA ANTIBODIES TO BIND TO THE SURFACE
           OF LIVE BORRELIA OR TO INHIBIT GROWTH CORRELATES WITH
        PROTECTION AGAINST TICK CHALLENGE USING A B. AFZELJI TYPE 2
                                             STRAIN
  [00332]       The purpose of this study was to establish correlates of protection of mice
  immunized with the chimeric OspA 1/2 antigen in a tick challenge model, which
  utilizes the natural infection route by using feral ticks collected from Budweis in the
  Czech Republic to infect the mice. Since nymphal ticks from this endemic area are
  so predominantly infected with B. afzeli, they are considered to provide a B. afzeii
  OspA type 2 strain challenge. As set out in Example 10, the parameters analyzed
 were the potency of anti-OspA antibodies to bind to the surface of live Borreliae or to
 inhibit growth of Borreliae, both of which had been shown to correlate well against
 needle challenge with Borrelia bugdorferi s.s. Thus, this study serves to extend the
 applicability of using these two parameters as correlates of protection against natural
 infection of B. afzeli, the most prominent human disease associated genospecies in
 Europe.
 [00333]       Forty mice were immunized with a sub-optimal 3 ng dose of the rOspA
 1/2 antigen adjuvanted with 0.2% AI(OH)3), which was 10-fold lower than the lower
 dose used in Example 9, in a prime-booster regimen. As in Example 10, this sub
 optimal dose was chosen in order to ensure that both protected and infected animals
would be observed after challenge. Vaccination was carried out subcutaneously
using an injection volume of 100 pIl on days 0, 14 and 28. On day 40, individual
blood samples were taken from the mice to generate pre-challenge sera. Because
the limited number of ticks available did not allow the challenge of all 40 mice, 20
                                               114

   mice were selected based on surface binding and anti-type 2 IgG concentrations to
   cover a broad range of responses. Eight ticks were applied to each mouse and were
   allowed to feed on the mice for 5 days. Four weeks after the challenge, the mice
   were sacrificed and the infectious status of the immunized and control mice was
   determined by Western blotting of sera against membrane antigens from B.
   burgdorferi s.s., B. afzelii and B. garinii; culture of Borrelia organisms from the
   bladder; and real time PCR detection of Borrelia from DNA extracted from the
  bladder.
  [00334]      Quantitation of OspA antibody binding to the surface of live Borreliae. In
  this assay, B. afzelii strain Arcon expressing OspA type 2 was incubated at a fixed
  dilution (1:100) with the pre-challenge mouse sera at room temperature in the
  presence of EDTA to prevent complement activation. After washing to remove
  unbound antibody, antibodies specifically bound to the cell surface were labeled by
  incubating the treated cells with an r-Phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-mouse Ig
 polyclonal antibody. All subsequent steps in the assay where similar to those
 described in Example 10. Normal mouse serum served as the negative control for
 non-specific antibody binding. A high titer mouse serum raised against the tri
 component rOspA vaccine formulation, together with OspA serotype 2-specific mAbs
 served as positive controls to confirm OspA serotype specificity and the OspA
 expression level of cells in the bacterial culture.
 [00335]      Bacterial growth inhibition assay. To measure the potency of the pre
 challenge sera to inhibit growth of Borreliae, the B. afzeli strain Arcon expressing
 OspA type 2 was cultured at 33 *C in the presence of serial dilutions of heat
inactivated pre-challenge or non-immune mouse serum (negative control) without
complement. When the bacteria in the control cultures, which were incubated with
non-immune sera, had grown sufficiently, as determined microscopically, accurate
cell counts were made by flow cytometric analysis. The procedure used to count the
bacteria was similar to that previously described for the growth inhibition assay in
Example 10. The serum dilution which inhibited bacterial growth by 50% was
calculated in comparison to the NMS control and reported as GI-50 titer. A standard
serum preparation was used to normalize titers between different assays.
                                               115

   [00336]     Statistical analysis. Distribution of the measured serum parameters were
  compared in infected and protected animals by the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U
  test (Graphpad Prism Version 5.0).
  [00337]      Results. Of the 20 animals immunized three times with 0.003 pg of
  rOspA 1/2 and challenged with 8 feral ticks, 7/20 (35%) were found to be infected.
  Due to limited tick availability, it was not possible to determine the exact infection
  rate of the challenge by challenging a control group of non-immunized mice.
  However, this challenge was not required for the purpose of the present study, and
  typically a rate of infection of 70-80% is achieved in challenge experiments with feral
  ticks from Budweis.
  [00338]     Significant differences were detected between the protected and infected
 groups for the results of the surface binding (p = 0.007) and growth inhibition (p =
 0.03) assays (Figure 20).
 [00339]      Conclusion. In this study it has been shown that a statistically significant
 correlation exists between the functional antibody content in mouse serum at the
 time of challenge and the protection against infection with a feral tick challenge
 applying 8 ticks per mouse. FACS-based fluorescence intensity measurements of
 live Borreliae expressing OspA type 2, which reflects the number of anti-OspA
 antibody molecules attached to the cell surface performed after incubation of the
 bacteria with the pre-challenge sera at a fixed dilution, correlated best with
 protection. Growth inhibition titers also correlated well with protection. In contrast to
 Borrelia burgdorferi s.s. strains, where complement is required for efficient killing,
rOspA1/2 antigen induced antibodies that effectively inhibit Borrelia growth even in
the absence of complement.
[00340]      The results of the studies presented in Example 10 and 11, when taken
together, establish the in vitro parameters of the mean fluorescent intensity (MFI) of
surface bound antibody to live Borreliae and the GI-50 titer of immune mouse sera
as "correlates of protection" in both examples where active mouse protection models
are currently available (e.g., namely, a needle challenge model for B. burgdorferi
s.s. OspA Type 1 strains and a tick challenge model for B. afzelii OspA Type 2
strains. Moreover, in the absence of reliable active protection models for evaluating
protection against homologous B. garinii strains expressing OspA types 3-6, by
                                              116

    inference, the aforementioned models can be used as in vitro "surrogate markers of
    protection" to evaluate the protective potential and cross strain coverage of various
    vaccine formulations for strains expressing all the vaccine homologous OspA types
    and even for those expressing heterologous OspA types. Indeed, when studies
    using these functional immune response assays were carried out on immune sera
   from mice immunized with the 3-component chimeric rOspA vaccine formulation,
   then comparable MFI and GI-50 titers were obtained for 8. garinii (OspA types 3, 4,
   5, 6) (see Examples 13), thus indicating, through these surrogate markers of
   protection, that protective responses were also achieved against strains for which
   currently no active mouse protection model exists. Furthermore, by comparing the
   immune responses of mice immunized with either (a), individual chimeric rOspA
   antigens; (b), or any one of the possible 2-component chimeric rOspA antigen
   vaccine formulation combinations; or (c), the 3-component chimeric rOspA antigen
  formulation, it was possible to show that the latter 3-component vaccine was
  required to optimally cover strains expressing OspA types 1-6 (Example 14).
  Moreover, through the use of these in vitro surrogate marker assays, it was possible
  to show that immune responses produced after immunizing mice with the 3
  component chimeric rOspA vaccine formulation (rOspA 1/2, rOspA 6/4 and rOspA
  5/3) do induce functional immune responses to all intra type variants (or subtypes) of
  types 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6 tested to date (see Example 15) and even to heterologous
  OspA types, other than the homologous OspA types 1-6 present within the vaccine
  (see Example 16).
                                       EXAMPLE 12:
        MULTIVALENT RECOMBINANT OSPA FORMULATION COMPRISING 3
          ANTIGENS (1/2,6/4, AND 5/3) IS HIGHLY IMMUNOGENIC IN MICE
 [00341]      A multivalent OspA vaccine (rOspA 1/2, rOspA 5/3, and rOspA 6/4) was
 evaluated in a tick challenge model. Three recombinant OspA antigens containing
the protective epitopes from OspA serotype 1 and 2 (SEQ ID NO: 2), OspA serotype
6 and 4 (SEQ ID NO: 4), and OspA serotype 5 and 3 (SEQ ID NO: 6) were combined
in a vaccine.
[00342]       Groups of ten female C3H/HeJ mice (age at immunization: 11 weeks)
were immunized subcutaneously on days 0 and 28 with a fixed dose of 0.3 pg of the
                                            117

    multivalent vaccine (0.1 pg of each, rOspA 1/2, rOspA 5/3, and rOspA 6/4). The tick
    challenge was done as described herein above with ticks from Budweis, Czech
    Republic. The ability of the feral ticks to transmit B.burgdorferi si to mice was
   confirmed by challenging un-immunized control animals. The infection status of the
   challenged mice was determined by Western blotting, real-time PCR, and by culture.
   [00343]     Interim blood samples were taken on day 41 by orbital puncture. Final
   blood samples (day 70/71) were collected by heart puncture. Individual sera were
   prepared from whole blood by centrifugation (10 minutes; 1000-2000xG; RT). Sera
   were stored at     - 20*C until use.
   [00344]     In this experiment unfed ticks, taken from the same batch used to
  challenge the mice, were characterized to determine the overall infection rate and to
  confirm the species of the infecting organisms. When 80 nymphal ticks were tested
  for the presence of B.burgdorferi s.I. DNA by 16S rRNA real-time PCR, 32.5%
  (26/80) were found to be infected. The OspA-serotype could be determined by PCR
  ELISA for 22 of the 26 infected nymphs; 86% (19/22) were typed as B. afze/iiand
  14% (3/22) as B.burgdorferis.s.
  [00345]     All of the non-immunized control mice (100%; 10/10) became infected,
 whereas only one of the mice immunized with the multivalent rOspA vaccine became
 infected (10%; 1/10). There was 100% agreement between the different methods
 used to identify infected mice. The multivalent rOspA vaccine resulted in a
 statistically highly significant protection (p=0.00012; Fisher's exact two tailed test)
 when compared to the control group.
 [00346]      These data show that immunization with a multivalent rOspA vaccine,
 which contains the rOspA 1/2 antigen, is able to prevent infection with B. afzeii, a
 Borrelia species which expresses a serotype 2 OspA. Further, there is no evidence
that the inclusion of additional rOspA antigens has an antagonistic effect on the
 protective immunity afforded by the rOspA 1/2 antigen.
[00347]       This vaccine provided protection against tick-transmitted infection with B.
afzelii which was equivalent to that seen with the OspA 1/2 antigen; 0.3pg of the
vaccine (0.1 pg of each antigen) formulated with 0.2% AI(OH)3 and administered in a
two dose schedule provided 90% protection as determined by Western blot, culture
of Borreia and detection of Borrelia DNA by PCR.

      A VACCINE COMPRISING THE THREE-COMPONENT VACCINE (OSPA 1/2,
      OSPA 6/4, AND OSPA 5/3) INDUCES HIGH LEVELS OF FUNCTIONAL ANTI
     OSPA ANTIBODIES WHICH BIND TO AND INHIBIT GROWTH OF BORRELIA
                         STRAINS EXPRESSING OSPA TYPES 1-6
   [00348]    Since both surface binding (MFI) and growth inhibition (GI-50 titers) were
   shown to be good correlates of protection in a needle challenge (B. burgdorferis.s.)
   model (Example 10) and in a tick challenge (B. afzeli) mouse model (Example 11),
  the present study was undertaken to determine if equivalent functional immune
  responses are induced by the 3-component chimeric rOspA antigen vaccine
  formulation against B. garinii OspA serotypes 3-6, for which no in vivo protection
  model is available to investigate the efficacy of a vaccine.
  [00349]    Mouse immunization. Groups of 10 female C3H/HeJ mice were
  immunized subcutaneously three times (day 0, day 14, day 28) with a 1:1:1 mixture
 of rOspA-1/2, rOspA-6/4 and rOspA-5/3) at three different doses (1, 0.1, 0.03 pg
 protein per dose) combined with 0.2% AI(OH)3 as an adjuvant. Serum was
 generated from blood samples taken on day 40.
 [00350]     Ouantitation of OspA antibody binding to the surface of live Borreliae. In
 this assay, in vitro grown cultures of six representative Borrelia strains expressing
 OspA types 1-6 (B. burgdorferi sensu stricto B31/OspA-1; B. afzelii Arcon/OspA-2; B.
 garinii PBr/OspA-3; B. garinii DK6/OspA-4; B. garinii W/OspA-5; and B. garinii
 KL1 1/OspA-6) were incubated at a fixed dilution (1:100) with pools of the peak titer
 mouse sera at room temperature in the presence of EDTA to prevent complement
 activation. The subsequent washing, labeling, detection and analysis procedures
 were similar to those described in Example 10. Normal mouse serum served as the
 negative control for non-specific binding of antibodies.
[00351]      Bacterial growth inhibition assay. To measure the potency of the pre
challenge sera to inhibit growth of Borreliae, six representative strains expressing
OspA types 1-6 (B31, Arcon, PBr, DK6, W, and KL1 1) were cultured at 33'C in the
presence of serial dilutions of heat-inactivated peak titer serum pools or non-immune
mouse serum (negative control). B31 was cultured in the presence of complement
(guinea pig serum), while the other five strains were tested in the absence of
                                            119

   complement. Once again, growth inhibition assays were carried out as described in
   Example 10. A standard serum preparation was used to normalize titers between
  different assays.
   [00352]     Surface binding and growth inhibiting efficiency of anti-OspA antibody
   responses. Intense fluorescence staining with MFI values, ranging from 50 to 200,
  was observed for all six Borrelia strains when tested with the three serum pools
  derived from the different immunization dose groups (1.0, 0.1 and 0.03 pg protein
  per dose) of the 3-component vaccine at a dilution of 1:100 (Figure 21). When the
  serum pools from the 3 dose groups were tested for their capacity to inhibit bacterial
  growth, the 3-component vaccine was also found to have induced strong G1-50 titers
  to all six OspA type strains, ranging from 1000 (type 4 strain, 0.03 pg dose) to
  20,000 (type 6 strain).
  [00353]      Conclusion. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the rOspA
  antigens are highly immunogenic and induce large quantities of functional antibodies
 which can bind to the surface of live Borreliae and inhibit growth of Borreliae.
  Coverage among the six strains tested was complete, as high fluorescence
 intensities and high growth inhibition titers were detected, comparable to the levels
 observed for the OspA types 1 and 2. In summary, the results presented in this
 study indicate that antibody responses induced by the tri-component rOspA vaccine
 (1/2  +  5/3 + 6/4), when formulated with AI(OH)3, prevent infections by strains
 expressing OspA types 1-6, which, as epidemiological studies have shown,
 theoretically covers over 99% of isolates causing human disease in Europe and
 North America and, thus, is highly effective in preventing Lyme Borreliosis.

[00354]       The purpose of this study was to investigate and compare the
immunogenicity and the cross strain coverage of functional surface binding and/or

    correlates of protection
    [00355]     Immunization of mice. Ten female mice (C3H) per group were immunized
   with 0.1 pg of a single component vaccine comprising rOspA 1/2 antigen, rOspA 6/4
   antigen, or rOspA 5/3 antigen; a two-component vaccine comprising 0.1 pg of both
    1/2 + 5/3 antigens, 1/2 + 6/4 antigens, or 5/3 + 6/4 antigens; or a three-component
   vaccine comprising a combination 0.1 pg of all three 1/2+ 5/3+ 6/4 antigens
   adjuvanted with 0.2% AI(OH)3 in a prime-booster regimen. Vaccination was carried
   out subcutaneously using a dose volume of 200 p1 on days 0, 14 and 28. On day 42,
   individual blood samples were taken from mice to generate sera.
   [00356]      Antibody suface binding and growth inhibition assays. A slightly modified
  version of the surface binding assay was used to determine the efficiency of anti
  OspA IgG to bind to the surface of live Borreliae. Serial dilutions of a serum pool
  with defined MFI titers were included in the analyses to create a standard curve from
  which relative titers of test sera were read off after interpolation with a non-linear
  regression curve. The MFI titer of standard serum for the individual strains
  expressing OspA types 1-6 was defined as the highest dilution at which the
  fluorescence intensity of the Borre/iae was determined to be at least 3-fold over the
  fluorescence intensity observed with normal mouse serum. All determinations were
 carried out in duplicate.
 [00357]       The scatter plots presented in Figure 22 compare the MFI titers to the six
 strain expressing homologous OspA types observed for the immune sera of
 individual C3H mice after immunization with either single rOspA antigens or rOspA
 antigen combinations. Results showed that a formulation containing all three rOspA
 antigens (1/2, 5/3 and 6/4) was necessary to induce high MFI titers against all six
 Borrelia strains expressing OspA types 1-6, and that formulations composed of two
 rOspA antigens (i.e. covering four strains) did not fully cover the strains expressing
the two OspA types not present in the formulation.
[00358]       To determine the potency of the various vaccine combinations to induce
growth inhibiting antibodies, six representative Borreliae strains (B31, Arcon, PBr,
DK6, W, KL1 1), expressing OspA types 1-6 respectively, were cultured at 33*C in
the presence of heat-inactivated immune or non-immune mouse serum pools. All
                                              121

    sera were tested at a single dilution. The following dilutions were used: B31, PBr
    and KL1 11:200, Arcon, DK6 and W 1:100. PBr was cultured in the absence of 20%
    complement, while the other 5 strains were tested in the presence of complement.
    Baby rabbit complement was used for DK6, W and KL1 1, while guinea pig serum
   was used for B31 and Arcon. When the bacteria in the control cultures incubated
   with non- immune sera had grown sufficiently, as determined microscopically,
   accurate cell counts were made as described previously (see Example 10). The
   percentage of bacterial growth inhibition was calculated from the cell count observed
   with test serum relative to the normal mouse serum control. The overall growth
   inhibition observed for the different formulations tested was then presented (Figure
   23) as the number of animals among the different groups of ten C3H mice that
   showed more than 50% growth inhibition. Results demonstrated that the 3
   component formulation was the only formulation capable of inducing high titers of
   growth-inhibiting antibodies against all six representative strains expressing OspA
  types 1-6 (Figure 23). In all cases, the 3-component vaccine formulation provided
  >50% growth inhibition in >90% of the immunized animals. The 2-component
  vaccine formulations did not fully cover the two strains expressing the OspA types
  not present in the vaccine. The formulation comprising rOspA 1/2 + 6/4 did not cover
  the type 3 strain; the formulation comprising rOspA 1/2 + 5/3 formulation did not
  cover types 4 or 6; and the formulation comprising rOspA 5/3 + 6/4 did not cover
  type 1.

      THE MULTIVALENT OSPA VACCINE FORMULATION COVERS BORRELIA
     EXPRESSING INTRA-TYPE VARIANTS OR SUBTYPES OF OSPA TYPES 1-6
 [00359]      Although Borrelia OspA types 1-6 were selected as the basis for the
 design and construction of the multivalent rOspA vaccine, Borreliae which express
 OspA protein variants of types 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6 have also been isolated. These
variants, while being classified as being within the same type, have slightly altered
nucleotide gene sequences and amino acid protein sequences. Thus, intra-type
variants or subtypes exist among OspA types 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6 (see Figure 24). No
intra-type variant or subtype has yet been observed for OspA type 4.
                                             122

    [00360]    The purpose of this study was to confirm that immune serum generated
    by immunizing mice with the 3-component multivalent rOspA vaccine contains
   functional antibodies which can bind to the surface of live Borreliae expressing these
   intra-type variants or subtypes.
   [00361]     For this study, a pooled mouse immune serum was generated by
   immunizing 70 female C3H mice three times with 0.3 pg of the 3-component
   multivalent rOspA vaccine on days 0, 14 and 28. On day 42, mice were bled and
   serum was obtained and pooled. The pooled immune serum was then used to test
  for binding of antibodies to the surface of live Borre/iae. Borrelia cultures were
  incubated with the immune serum pool or control normal mouse serum at 1:100 in
  duplicate, and fluorescence intensities of Borreiae measuring binding of anti-OspA
  antibodies to the bacteria was monitored by FACS analyses as described herein
  above.
  [00362]      High levels of surface binding antibodies (defined as a fluorescence
  intensity of over 10 times that observed for a non-immunized mouse control serum)
 at a serum dilution of 1:100 were detected for most of the strains expressing OspA
 subtypes 1-6. In particular, high levels of antibody binding were detected with
 Borre/iae strains expressing OspA sub-types 1a, 1b, 1c, 1d, 1f, 1h, 1J, 1k, and 11; 2a,
 2b, 2e, 2g, 2k, 21, and 2n; 3a, 3c, 3d, and 3e; 5a and 5c; and 6a, 6e, 6f, 6g, and 6k
 (Figure 24). Weaker binding (defined as a fluorescence intensity of between 2-10
 times that observed for a non-immunized mouse control serum) was observed with
 Borreliae strains expressing OspA subtypes 1g, 2j, 2m, 3b, 5d, and 61 (Figure 24),
 but this weaker binding was primarily due to the low expression of the OspA protein
under the growth conditions used.
[00363]       Conclusion. The 3-component chimeric rOspA vaccine induces
functional, surface-binding antibodies against all intra-type variants or subtypes of
OspA types 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6 in C3H mice.

  the homologous OspA types 1-6. 40 C3H mice were immunized three times with 0.3
  pg of the 3-component vaccine on days 0, 14 and 28. On day 42, the mice were
  bled, and a serum pool was made and used to evaluate the efficiency of surface
  binding and growth inhibition against strains expressing heterologous OspA types.
 [00365]       The results of this study showed that the 3-component chimeric rOspA
 vaccine does induce antibodies which bind to the surface of Borreliae and inhibit
 growth of other types of Borre/iae, including strains of B. spielmanii, B. valaisiania, B.
 lusitaniae and B. japonica (see Table 9). In the case of B. garini expressing OspA
 type 7, only weak surface binding and little or no growth inhibition was observed;
 however, this weak binding and small amount of growth inhibition may be due to low
 expression levels of OspA under the in vitro culture conditions used rather than to
 the lack of binding of immune serum antibodies.

    MULTIVALENT OSPA VACCINE FORMULATIONS INDUCES ANTIBODIES TO A
     COMMON EPITOPE AT THE N-TERMINUS OF THE OSPA MOLECULE WHICH
       CAN CONTRIBUTE TO PROTECTION AGAINST ANY OSPA EXPRESSING
                                      BORRELIA STRAIN
   [00366]      During the course of investigating the protective efficacy of multivalent
   chimeric rOspA formulations, a monoclonal antibody (F237/BK2) was generated
   against a 2-component rOspA vaccine comprising rOspA-1/2 and rOspA-6/4.
   F237/BK2 was shown by anti-OspA ELISA to bind to all OspA types investigated
   thus far (OspA types 1-7), as well as to the 3 chimeric rOspA antigens (rOspA-1/2,
   rOspA-5/3 and rOspA-6/4) Such result indicate that F237/BK2 recognizes a
   common epitope found on all OspA molecules. Moreover, preliminary epitope
   mapping studies indicate that this common epitope is located on the less variable N
  terminal half of the molecule (i.e. at the N-terminus of amino acid 130), where OspA
  sequence homologies are most commonly observed.
  [00367]      Interestingly, F237/BK2 was also shown to bind to the surface of Borreliae
  expressing homologous OspA types 1-6 and heterologous OspA types, including
  those expressed by B. spielmani, B. valaisiania and B. japonica, albeit less
  efficiently than monoclonal antibodies directed against C-terminal type- specific
  epitopes. Using methods similar to those described in previous examples, F237/BK2
 was also found to inhibit the growth of representative strains expressing OspA types
  1, 2, 4, 5 and 6.
 [00368]       When F237/BK2 was tested in an in vivo passive protection model in
 mice, F237/BK2 was observed to confer protection against feral tick challenge,
 corresponding to a B. afzelii Type 2 challenge. Ticks were collected in Wundschuh
 (Styria, Austria), which are known to be predominantly infected with B. afzeii.       Ten
female C3H mice were injected intraperitoneally with 500 pg of affinity-purified nAb
 F237/BK2. Two hours later, 8 ticks were applied per animal to 10 passively
immunized mice as well as to 10 sham-immunized animals. Four days later, the fed
ticks were removed. On day 90, mice were sacrificed and analyzed for infection by
serological testing, PCR analysis and Borre/ia culture, as described herein above.
No animal was infected in the group treated with F237/BK2, whereas 5 animals
                                             125

    (50%) were infected with B. afzelii in the control group. Thus, monoclonal antibody
    F237/BK2 provided statistically significant (p - 0.0325) passive protection against a
   tick challenge when compared with the sham-immunized control mice. This is the
   first time that a monoclonal antibody which binds to a common epitope on the N
   terminal half of the molecule has been reported to be involved in protection.
   Moreover, if a vaccine could induce antibodies recognizing this common epitope,
   such an antibody would certainly contribute to the vaccine's cross protective efficacy.
   [00369]      To test whether such antibodies were indeed induced by the 3
  component chimeric rOspA vaccine formulation, a monoclonal antibody inhibition
   ELISA was carried out employing peroxidase-labeled F237/BK2. In these
  experiments, a GST-OspA type 3 protein was used as coating antigen, and either
  normal mouse serum or a serum pool from C3H mice immunized three times with
  the 3-component chimeric rOspA vaccine was added to the wells at a dilution of
  1:100. Sixty minutes later, peroxidase-labeled F237/BK2 was added at a pre
 optimized concentration to eventually give an Optical Density (OD) value of around 1
 for the non-inhibiting normal mouse serum control, and incubation was continued for
 an additional 60 min. Finally, ELISA plates were washed and developed with TMB
 substrate.
 [00370]       Using this monoclonal antibody inhibition ELISA assay, it could be
 demonstrated that the 3-component chimeric rOspA formulation does indeed induce
 antibodies which bind to an epitope identical to or in close proximity to the epitope
 recognized by mAb F237/BK2. OD values were significantly reduced (e.g., typically
 by 20-30%) by the anti-OspA immune sera compared to the non-inhibiting normal
 mouse serum control.
[00371]        Conclusion. This study shows that the 3-component chimeric rOspA
vaccine is able to induce both a type-specific and a broad cross-protective immune
response.

   [00372]     The aim of the study was to design additional novel OspA antigens
   comprising serotypes 1 and 2, 6 and 4, and 5 and 3, respectively. Three synthetic
   OspA genes (SEQ ID NOS: 168 (orig sOspA 1/2), 170 (orig sOspA 6/4), and 172
   (orig sOspA 5/3)) were designed to encode OspA polypeptide molecules with
   protective epitopes from OspA serotypes 1 and 2 (orig sOspA 1/2), OspA serotypes
   6 and 4 (orig sOspA 6/4) and OspA serotypes 5 and 3 (orig sOspA 5/3) of Borrelia.
   The primary amino acid sequences of these molecules (SEQ ID NOS: 169,171, and
   173, respectively) are provided in Table 1. These sequences comprise original
  chimeric constructs, i.e. without mutations and without codon optimization.

  [00373]     A multivalent OspA vaccine comprising original construct formulations
 without codon optimization and without mutations (orig OspA 1/2, orig OspA 5/3, and
 orig OspA 6/4) is evaluated in a tick challenge model. Three recombinant OspA
 antigens containing the protective epitopes from OspA serotypes 1 and 2 (SEQ ID
 NO: 169), OspA serotypes 6 and 4 (SEQ ID NO: 171), and OspA serotypes 5 and 3
 (SEQ ID NO: 173) are combined in a vaccine.
 [00374]      Groups of ten female C3H/HeJ mice (age at immunization: 11 weeks) are
 immunized subcutaneously on days 0 and 28 with a fixed dose of 0.3 pg of the
 multivalent vaccine (0.1 pg of each, orig OspA 1/2, orig OspA 5/3, and orig OspA
6/4). The tick challenge is done as described herein above with ticks from Budweis,
Czech Republic. The ability of the feral ticks to transmit B.burgdorferi s.l to mice is
confirmed by challenging un-immunized control animals. The infection status of the
challenged mice is determined by Western blotting, real-time PCR, and by culture.
[00375]      Interim blood samples are taken on day 41 by orbital puncture. Final
blood samples (day 70/71) are collected by heart puncture. Individual sera are
                                           127

   prepared from whole blood by centrifugation (10 minutes; 1000-2000xG; RT). Sera
   are stored at    - 200C until use.
   [00376]     In this experiment unfed ticks, taken from the same batch used to
   challenge the mice, are characterized to determine the overall infection rate and to
   confirm the species of the infecting organisms.

  [00377]     The results presented in Example 13 indicate that antibody responses
  induced by the tri-component rOspA vaccine (lipB sOspAl/2 + lipB sOspA 5/3 + lipB
 sOspA 6/4), when formulated with AI(OH)3, prevent infections by strains expressing
 OspA types 1-6 and, therefore, are effective in preventing Lyme Borreliosis. Thus,
 the present study is being carried out to determine if equivalent functional immune
 responses are induced by the tri-component OspA vaccine comprising chimeric
 original (orig) OspA antigens (Orig sOspAl/2 + Orig sOspA 5/3 + Orig sOspA 6/4).
 [00378]      Mouse immunization. Groups of 10 female C3H/HeJ mice are immunized

pg protein per dose) combined with 0.2% AI(OH)3 as an adjuvant. Serum is
generated from blood samples taken on day 40.
[00379]      Quantitation of OspA antibody binding to the surface of live Borreliae. In

KL1 1/OspA-6) are incubated at a fixed dilution (1:100) with pools of the peak titer
mouse sera at room temperature in the presence of EDTA to prevent complement
activation. The subsequent washing, labeling, detection and analysis procedures
are similar to those described in Examples 10 and 13. Normal mouse serum serves
as a negative control for non-specific binding of antibodies.

   [00384]     Antibody surface binding and growth inhibition assays. A slightly modified
  version of the surface binding assay described above is used to determine the
  efficiency of anti-OspA IgG to bind to the surface of live Borreliae. Serial dilutions of
  a serum pool with defined MFI titers are included in the analyses to create a
  standard curve from which relative titers of test sera are read off after interpolation
  with a non-linear regression curve. The MFI titer of standard serum for the individual
  strains expressing OspA types 1-6 is defined as the highest dilution at which the
  fluorescence intensity of the Borreliae is determined to be at least 3-fold over the
  fluorescence intensity observed with normal mouse serum. All determinations are
  carried out in duplicate.
  [00385]     To determine the potency of the various vaccine combinations to induce
  growth inhibiting antibodies, six representative Borreliae strains (B31, Arcon, PBr,
  DK6, W, KL1 1), expressing OspA types 1-6 respectively, are cultured at 33"C in the
  presence of heat-inactivated immune or non-immune mouse serum pools. All sera
 are tested at a single dilution. The following dilutions are used: B31, PBr and KL1 1
  1:200, Arcon, DK6 and W 1:100. PBr is cultured in the absence of 20%
 complement, while the other 5 strains are tested in the presence of complement.
 Baby rabbit complement is used for DK6, W and KL1 1, while guinea pig serum is
 used for B31 and Arcon. When the bacteria in the control cultures incubated with
 non- immune sera has grown sufficiently, as determined microscopically, accurate
 cell counts are made as described previously (see Example 10). The percentage of
 bacterial growth inhibition is calculated from the cell count observed with test serum
 relative to the normal mouse serum control. The overall growth inhibition observed
for the different formulations tested is then presented as the number of animals
among the different groups of ten C3H mice that showed more than 50% growth
inhibition.

     THE MULTIVALENT OSPA VACCINE FORMULATION COVERS BORRELIA
    EXPRESSING INTRA-TYPE VARIANTS OR SUBTYPES OF OSPA TYPES 1-6
[00386]      The purpose of this study was to confirm that immune serum generated
by immunizing mice with the 3-component multivalent orig OspA vaccine (orig
sOspA 1/2, orig sOspA 6/4, and orig sOspA 5/3) contains functional antibodies which
                                             130

   can bind to the surface of live Borreliae expressing these intra-type variants or
   subtypes.
   [00387]     For this study, a pooled mouse immune serum is generated by
   immunizing 70 female C3H mice three times with 0.3 pg of the 3-component
   multivalent orig OspA vaccine on days 0, 14 and 28. On day 42, mice are bled and
  serum is obtained and pooled. The pooled immune serum is then used to test for
  binding of antibodies to the surface of live Borreliae. Borrelia cultures are incubated
  with the immune serum pool or control normal mouse serum at 1:100 in duplicate,
  and fluorescence intensities of Borreliae measuring binding of anti-OspA antibodies
  to the bacteria are monitored by FAGS analyses as described herein above.
                                        EXAMPLE 23:
        DOSING., SAFETY, IMMUNOGENICITY, AND FUNCTIONAL ANTIBODY
         RESPONSE OF THE MULTIVALENT OSPA VACCINE FORMULATION
 [00388]      Three dose levels (30, 60, and 90pg) of trivalent (i.e., 3-component
 multivalent) vaccine comprising lipB sOspA 1/2251 (SEQ ID NO: 2), lipB sOspA 6/4
 (SEQ ID NO: 4), and lipB sOspA 5/3 (SEQ ID NO: 6), with and w/o AI(OH) 3 adjuvant,
 were tested in a dose escalation study in subjects 18-70 years of age. The vaccine
 formulation was tested for safety, immunogenicity, antibody persistence, and booster
 response in a double-blind, randomized, multicenter dose escalation study. Subjects
 received 3 vaccinations at monthly intervals (Day 1, Day 29, and Day 57). A booster
 was administered at 9-12 months to selected subjects.
 Safety After Primary Immunizations
[00389]      After the primary immunization, safety was evaluated. The adjuvanted
formulations showed superior tolerability compared to non-adjuvanted formulations
with respect to systemic reactions. There was no significant dose effect within
adjuvanted formulations for systemic reactions. There was no significant dose or
adjuvant effect for local reactions. The 90 pg non-adjuvanted formulation was
excluded from the booster dose for tolerability reasons. Thus, preliminary results
indicate that safety information favors adjuvanted over non-adjuvanted formulations.
                                            131

    Immunogenicity After Primaty Immunizations
    [00390]     There was substantial antibody response after three-dose priming.
   Adjuvanted formulations showed significant lower immunogenicity against all OspA
   types compared to the non-adjuvanted formulations (ANCOVA analysis). There was
   no statistical significant dose effect within the adjuvanted formulations on Day 85 for
   all OspA types.
   [00391]      The 30pg and 60pg (as backup) adjuvanted formulations were selected
   for further study in a larger population of seronegative and seropositive subjects.
   Data indicate that the 30pg adjuvanted dose is immunogenic with no significant
  improvement at higher dose levels. Data indicate that there was a superior
  tolerability profile with adjuvanted formulations. The 60 pg adjuvanted dose was
  continued to determine if any superior response is indicated after booster vaccination
  or primary vaccination in seronegative/seropositive subjects.
  [00392]      Seropersistence was observed up to 9 months after the first vaccination
  (Day 271). In fact, antibody persistence by Day 271 was comparable for the three
 adjuvanted dose levels, with the 90pg adjuvanted formulation demonstrating slightly
 better seropersistence. Antibodies induced by the non-adjuvanted formulations
 persisted at somewhat higher levels.
 Immunogenicity After Booster Vaccinations
 [00393]       There were substantial increases in antibody titers after booster
 vaccinations. There was a statistically significant positive effect of adjuvantation on
 ELISA titer. There was no influence of age on post-booster ELISA titer. Functional
antibody titers correlated well with ELISA titers.
 Functional Antibody Response Data
[00394]        Functional antibody response was measured by a surface binding assay,
a monoclonal antibody competitive inhibition (mAb Cl) ELISA, and a Borre/ia
killing/growth inhibition assay. The surface binding assay is a flow cytometry-based
assay that quantifies the level of antibodies within test sera that bind to the surface of
live Borrelia. The mAb Cl ELISA measures the amount of antibody within test sera
which binds to known protective or Borrelicidal specific epitopes as defined by
mouse anti-OspA type specific mAbs. The Borrelia killing/growth inhibition assay
measures the killing/growth inhibition activity of test sera in the presence of
                                              132

    complement by quantifying the number of viable cells in a culture on the bases of
   ATP levels using a highly sensitive Luciferase luminescence assay.
   [00395]     In general, primary response and six-month antibody persistence levels
   were slightly greater with the non-adjuvanted formulations. However, post-booster
   functional antibody responses were equivalent, if not better, for the adjuvanted
   formulations. Post-booster adjuvanted functional antibody titers were (1) 10-12 fold
   higher than peak primary response levels for the surface binding assay; (2) 7-8 fold
   higher than peak primary response levels for the Borrelia killing/growth inhibition
   assay; and (3) 2-3 fold higher than primary responses for the mAb Cl ELISA assay.
   Safety After Booster Vaccinations
  [00396]     After the booster vaccinations, safety was evaluated. Systemic reactions
  occurred at a low rate both in adjuvanted and non-adjuvanted formulations. The
  majority of systemic reactions were mild (only two moderate reactions). Only mild
  reactions were reported in the 30pg dose group with or without adjuvant. No severe
  local reactions occurred within seven days after the booster. There were no related
  SAEs with any dose/formulation so far in the study

     DOSE RECOMMENDATION FOR PHASE 3 STUDY WITH THE MULTIVALENT
                             OSPA VACCINE FORMULATION
 [00397]      Three dose levels with and without adjuvant were tested in various
 subjects in Phasel /2 studies of the multivalent OspA vaccine formulation. These
 studies indicated that there is better tolerability and substantial antibody response of
 adjuvanted formulations after 3-dose priming. There were no clinically relevant
 differences in antibody persistence between adjuvanted formulations. There was a
 significant positive effect of adjuvantation on antibody titers after the booster
 vaccination, and optimal immune response after the booster vaccination was seen
with the 30pg adjuvanted formulation with no significant improvement at higher dose
levels. Functional antibody results confirmed the anti-OspA IgG ELISA results.
