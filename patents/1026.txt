PREDICTING MOTOR FAILURE BASED ON RELATIONSHIP OF MOTOR
                   PAIR CHARACTERISTICS
BACKGROUND
[0001]  The present invention relates to monitoring
mining machine components.
SUMMARY
[0002]  Mining machines,  such as continuous miners,
often include motor pairs   for driving similar
components.   For example, a continuous miner includes a
motor pair for driving cutting heads, a motor pair for
gathering heads, and a motor pair for tracks that move
the machine.   Motor failures on mining machines can be
costly and require a number of man-hours to repair and
replace parts.   The mining machine is generally
inoperable while being repaired, and the lack of
revenue-producing mining activity further compounds the
cost of motor failures.
[0003]  As each motor in the motor pair performs
similar work functions, a variance in their relative
temperatures may indicate a problem, a need for
maintenance, and/or predict a future malfunction.
Accordingly, embodiments of the invention include
detecting particular variances in the relative
temperatures of a motor pair, and generating an alarm
such that a costly failure of one of the motors can be
avoided.

from the group consisting of the parameter of the first
motor and the parameter of the second motor exceeds a
parameter threshold, and determining that the parameter
of the first motor differed from the parameter of the
second motor by at least a difference threshold for a
predetermined amount of time.

second motor;   and a controller coupled to the first and
second parameter sensors to obtain the first and second
parameters, the controller outputting an alarm signal
upon determining that at least one selected from the
group of the first parameter and the second parameter
exceeds a parameter threshold, and determining that the
first parameter of the first motor differed from the
second parameter of the second motor by at least a
difference threshold for a predetermined amount of
time.

[0006]   In a further embodiment, the invention provides
a method of predicting motor failure, the method
comprising:   receiving, by a controller, a first
parameter of a first motor on a mining machine from a
first parameter sensor on a mining machine;          receiving,
by the controller, a second parameter of a second motor
on the mining machine from a second parameter sensor on
the mining machine, wherein the second motor is
downstream from the first motor in a series cooling
system;  outputting a first alarm signal, by the
controller, upon determining that the first parameter
of the first motor is greater than the second parameter
of the second motor by at least a first difference
threshold;   and outputting a second alarm signal, by the
controller, upon determining that the second parameter
of the second motor is greater than the first parameter
of the first motor by at least a second difference
threshold, wherein the second difference threshold is
greater than the first difference threshold.
[0007]   In a further embodiment, the invention provides
a mining machine monitoring system, the system

receive the second parameter detected by the second
parameter sensor, output a first alarm signal upon
determining that the first parameter of the first motor
is greater than the second parameter of the second
motor by at least a first difference threshold, and
output a second alarm signal upon determining that the
second parameter of the second motor is greater than
the first parameter of the first motor by at least a
second difference threshold, wherein the second
difference threshold is greater than the first
different threshold.
[0008]   Also disclosed herein is a mining machine
monitoring system including a motor pair of a machine,
a first and second parameter sensor, and a motor pair
detection module.    The motor pair includes a first
motor and a second motor.    The first parameter sensor
detects a parameter of the first motor for a
predetermined time window, and the second parameter
sensor detects a second parameter of the second motor
for the predetermined time window.     The motor pair
detection module is coupled to the first and second
parameter sensors and obtains the detected parameters.
The motor pair detection module outputs an alarm signal
upon  (1) determining that at least one of the
parameters exceeds a parameter threshold during the
predetermined time window, and    (2) determining that the
parameter of the first motor differed from the
parameter of the second motor by at least a difference
threshold for at least a percentage threshold of the
predetermined time window.    In some embodiments, the
                                          9940920_1 (GHMatters) P96316.AU.1 2/02/18

parameter sensors are temperature sensors, the first
and second parameters are temperatures of the first
motor and second motor, respectively, and the parameter
threshold is a temperature threshold.
[0009]  Further disclosed herein is a method of
predicting motor failure.    The method includes
receiving, by a motor pair detection module, a
parameter of a first motor on a machine and a parameter
of a second motor on the machine for a predetermined
time window.   The method further includes outputting an
alarm signal, by the motor pair detection module, upon
determining that   (1) at least one of the parameter of
the first motor and the second motor exceeds a
parameter threshold during the predetermined time
window, and  (2) the parameter of the first motor
differed from the parameter of the second motor by at
least a difference threshold for at least a percentage
threshold of the predetermined time window.           In some
embodiments, the parameters are temperatures and the
parameter threshold is a temperature threshold.

apparent by consideration of the detailed description

[0020]  Fig. 1 illustrates a remote mining machine
monitoring system 100 including a mining machine 105 in
an underground mine shaft  110.   The mining machine 105
is in communication with a router 115, which is also
positioned in the mine shaft 110.     The router 115
communicates via a local mine network 120 with a
surface server 125.   The surface server 125 is further
in communication with one or more local clients 130,
which may include personal computers,    laptops, tablets,
smart phones, etc.,  and is in communication with the
Internet 135.   A remote server 140 is in communication
with the Internet 135 and remote clients 145,             such as
personal computers 145a, laptops    (not shown),          tablets
(not shown),  smart phones 145b, etc.
[0021]  Each of the components  in the system 100 are
communicatively coupled for bi-directional
communications.   The communication paths between any
two components of the system 100 may be wired              (e.g.,
via Ethernet  cables or otherwise),   wireless        (e.g., via
a WiFi@, cellular, Bluetooth@ protocols),        or a
combination thereof.   Although only a single mining
machine 105 and router 115 are depicted in Fig. 1,
additional mining machines 105 may be coupled to the
router 115.   Similarly, additional routers 115 may be
included to provide alternate communication paths to
the mine network 120 and to communicate with other
mining machines.   Thus, the mine network 120 provides
communication paths between the surface server 125 and
various mining machine 105 and routers 115.
Furthermore, additional remote clients 145,           remote
                                          9940920_1 (GHMatters) P96316.AU.1 2/02/18

servers   140, local clients 130,   surface servers              125 may
also be included in the system 100.
[0022]   Figs. 2A-C illustrate a continuous miner 150,
which is an example of the mining machine 105 in the
system 100.    The continuous miner 150 includes a cutter
system 155, which includes rotating cutters 160 with
teeth 165 that, essentially, scrape ore       (e.g., coal)
from a ceiling in a mine shaft.      The cutter system 155
is rotationally driven by a pair of motors via a gear
box.   That is,  the gear box receives the rotational
output of the motor pair and, in turn, drives the
cutters 160.    Falling ore is gathered in a collecting
tray 170 and funneled by gathering heads 175 toward a
conveyor 180.    The gathering heads 175 are each rotated
by a separate motor and the arms     185 push ore within
the collecting tray 170 onto the conveyor 180.                   The
continuous miner 150 further includes a set of left and
right tracks 190 to provide movement of the entire
machine.    Each set of tracks is driven by a separate
motor.   As shown in Figs. 2B, the cutter system 155 and
conveyor 180 may be raised and lowered, and, as shown
in Fig. 2C, the conveyor 180 may be pivoted about a
pivot point 195.
[0023]   Fig. 3 illustrates a block diagram of the
mining machine 105.    The mining machine 105 includes a
controller 200 coupled to an input/output          (I/O) module
202 for communicating with external devices, such as
the router 115.    The controller 200 is further coupled
to a motor pair 204,   temperature sensors 206, a user
I/O module 208,   other motors, pumps, actuators 210,                     and
other sensors 212.    The motor pair 204 includes a motor
                                           9940920_1 (GHMatters) P96316.AU.1 2/02/18

204a and a motor 204b, with each driving similar
components on the mining machine 105.      For example,
with reference to the continuous miner 150 of Figs. 2A
C, the motors 204a and 204b each have a rotational
output coupled to a single gear box     (not shown) used to
drive the cutter system 155.     The gear box, driven by
the motors 204a and 204b, in turn, drives the cutters
160 of the cutter system 155.     Similarly, the motor
204a may drive one of the gathering heads 175 or one of
the tracks   180, while the motor 204b drives the other
of the gathering heads 175 or the other of the tracks
180.   Generally, each motor of a particular motor pair
is of the same type and has    similar operating
characteristics.    Only a single motor pair 204 is
illustrated in Fig. 3 to simplify the following
explanation;   however, the mining machine 105, like the
continuous miner 150, may include multiple motor pairs
and associated temperature sensors, and embodiments of
the invention described herein may be applied to each
pair.
[0024]   The temperature  sensors 206a and 206b detect a
temperature of the motor 204a and 204b, respectively,
and provides a signal to the controller 200
representative of the measured temperatures.               The
temperature sensors 206 may continuously provide
temperature readings to the controller 200,            or may
provide temperature readings at discrete intervals.
The temperature   sensors 206a and 206b may be mounted on
or near the motors 204a and 204b, respectively, to
obtain the temperature data.
                                           9940920_1 (GHMatters) P96316.AU.1 2/02/18

                                     - 11
[0025]  The user I/O module 208 provides a user
interface and may include one or more of a display,
graphical user interface, control buttons, levers,
LEDs,  speakers, etc. to enable the user to operate the
mining machine 105.          The other motors, pumps,
actuators, etc. 210 represent the other controllable
components of the mining machine 105.           The other
sensors  212 represent the additional sensors used to
provide the controller 200 feedback on various
components of and environmental characteristics near to
the mining machine 105.
[0026]  Fig.  4 illustrates        a motor pair  detection                (MPD)
module 300.    Based on the temperature data obtained by
the temperature     sensors 206, the MPD module 300
monitors the temperature of the motor pair 204 to
predict an impending motor failure before significant
damage occurs to one of the motors 204a,b or related
components.    As each motor 204a,b, in the motor pair
204 performs similar work functions, a variance in
their relative temperatures may indicate a problem, a
need for maintenance, and/or predict a future
malfunction.    Accordingly, the MPD module 300 detects
particular variances in the relative temperatures of
the motor pair 204,         and generates an alarm such that a
failure of one of the motors 204a,b can be avoided.
[0027]  The MPD module 300 may be implemented on the
mining machine 105,         the remote server 140, the surface
server 125, one of the remote clients 145, or the local
client 130.    In some instances, the MPD module 300
receives real-time temperature data from the
temperature sensors 206, for example, when the MPD
                                                9940920_1 (GHMatters) P96316.AU.1 2/02/18

                             - 12
module 300 is implemented on the controller 200 of the
mining machine 105.   In some instances, the controller
200 aggregates sensor data collected from the
temperature sensors 206 and the other sensors 212 and
stores the aggregated sensor data in a memory of the
mining machine 105.   Periodically, the sensor data is
output as a data file via the router 115 to one of more
devices, such as the remote server 140,     the surface
server 125, the remote clients 145, and the local
client 130.   Generally, the data file includes the
sensor data aggregated since the previous data file was
sent.  For example, a new data file with sensor data
may be sent every fifteen minutes, the data file
including sensor data aggregated over the previous
fifteen minute window.
[0028]  The temperature data 305, whether obtained from
a data file of aggregated sensor data or in real time
from the temperature  sensors 206, is provided to a
temperature threshold module 310 and a temperature
difference module 315 of the MPD module 300.             The
temperature threshold module 310 and the temperature
difference module 315 analyze the temperature data 305,
and provide an output to the motor failure prediction
module 320 based on their analysis.
[0029]    The temperature threshold module 310
determines whether the temperature of either motor 204a
or 204b exceeded a high temperature threshold, such as
300 degrees Fahrenheit, at least once during the time
period that is being analyzed.    If at least one of the
motors 204a,b exceeded the high temperature, the
temperature threshold module 310 outputs an indication
                                         9940920_1 (GHMatters) P96316.AU.1 2/02/18

                                 -   13
of such   (e.g., a TRUE signal) to the motor failure
prediction module 320.       The temperature difference
module 315 determines whether, over the previous time
period  (e.g., fifteen minutes),        the temperature of the
motor 204a has varied from the temperature of the motor
204b by at least a particular amount            (a "difference
threshold") for at least a percentage threshold of the
time period.    If the temperatures of the motors 204a,b
varied by at least the difference threshold                   (e.g.,           45
degrees Fahrenheit) for at least a predetermined
percentage   (e.g., 95%) of the time period, the
temperature difference module 315 outputs an indication
of such   (e.g., a TRUE signal) to the motor failure
prediction module 320.
[0030]  If  the motor failure     prediction       module 320
receives a TRUE signal from both the temperature
threshold module 310 and the temperature difference
module 315, the motor failure prediction module 320
indicates to the alarm module 325 a prediction of a
failure of one of the motors 204a,b.             In response to
receiving a prediction of motor failure, the alarm
module 325 outputs an alarm 330.            Fig. 5 depicts a
logic timing diagram 335 illustrating the relationship
between the outputs of the temperature threshold module
310, the temperature difference module 315, the motor
failure prediction module 320, and the alarm module
325, as described above.
[0031]  The motor failure prediction module 320 may
also receive an indication from the temperature
difference module 315 of which motor 204a or 204b had a
higher temperature, as that motor would be associated
                                                  9940920_1 (GHMatters) P96316.AU.1 2/02/18

with the failure prediction.     The alarm signal 330 may
be transmitted to one or more of the controller 200,
the remote clients 145, the remote server 140, the
local client 130, and the surface server 125 to alert a
user, supervisor, and/or technician of a predicted
motor failure.    The alarm 330 may be transmitted via
the various components and networks of the system 100
to arrive the appropriate destination device, or, if
residing on the destination device     (e.g., the mining
machine 105),  may be communicated directly from the MPD
module 300.   The receiving users, supervisors, and/or
remote technicians may then take appropriate action to
prevent a motor failure, such as preventative
maintenance, upgrades,   repairs, and the like.               In some
instances, in response to receiving the alarm 330, the
controller 200 prevents or limits further operation of
one or both of the motors 204a,b to prevent failure of
the motor(s) 204ab.     In response to receive the alarm
330,  the destination device may produce one or more of
audible alerts   (sirens, beeps, etc.),   tactile alerts
(vibrations), or visual alerts     (flashing LEDs, text,
etc.)  to raise attention.   The alarm 330 may also
include alarm information, such as one or more of the
temperature data that caused the alarm 330 to be
generated, the identification of the mining machine
105,  identification of the motor pair 204,         location of
the mining machine, type of alarm, and other
information to inform the receiver of the alarm 330.
For example, whether the MPT 300 resides on the mining
machine 105 or the remote server 140, or elsewhere in
the system 100, the alarm 330 may cause:        LEDs to flash
                                           9940920_1 (GHMatters) P96316.AU.1 2/02/18

display of the mining machine 105;     a smart phone 145b

and/or a local client 130 to generate a pop-up screen
on a graphical user interface to display the alarm
information.
[0032]   Figs.  6A-B depict temperature data for the
motor pair 204 obtained from three consecutive data
files, each containing fifteen minutes of temperature
data 305.    Fig. 6A relates to the high temperature
threshold analysis performed by the temperature
threshold module 310.     During a first time window 350,
the temperatures of the motors 204a,b remain below a
high temp threshold 355, which is assumed to be 300
degrees Fahrenheit in this example.      During a second
time window 360, the temperature of motor 204a exceeds
the high temperature threshold 355 momentarily                 (see
portion 365).     In response to analyzing the temperature
data 305 for time window 360,     the temperature threshold
module 310 outputs a TRUE signal.      During a time window
370, the temperature of the motor 204a again exceeds
the high temperature threshold 355     (see portion 375).
In response to analyzing the temperature data 305 of
the time window 370, the temperature threshold module
310 also outputs a TRUE signal.
[0033]   Fig. 6B relates to the temperature difference
analysis performed by the temperature difference module
315.   Fig. 6B assumes a temperature difference
threshold 380 is 45 degrees Fahrenheit and a percentage
threshold of 95%.     During the first time window 350,
the temperature difference between the motor 204a and
                                           9940920_1 (GHMatters) P96316.AU.1 2/02/18

                                  - 16
the motor 204b varies less than the difference
threshold.      Accordingly, the temperature difference
module 315 does not output a TRUE signal for time
window 350.      During the time window 360, the
temperature difference between the motor 204a and the
motor 204b is less than the difference threshold for
all but the portion 385.       Since the ratio of the
portion 385 to the time window 360 is less than the
percentage threshold, the temperature difference module
315 does not output a TRUE signal. During the time
window 370, the temperature difference between the
motor 204a and the motor 204b is greater than the
difference threshold for a large portion of the window
(see portion 390).       In other words, of the fifteen
minutes of the time window 370, the difference
threshold was exceeded for at least        14 minutes and 15
seconds    (95% of  15 minutes).    Since the ratio of the
portion 390 to the time window 360 is greater than the
percentage threshold, the temperature difference module
315 outputs a TRUE signal.
[0034]   In   summary,  during the time window 370,               at
least one of the motors      (motor 204a) exceeds 300
degrees Fahrenheit     (the high temperature threshold
355),  and the temperature of the motor pair 204 varies
in excess of 45 degrees Fahrenheit        (the difference
threshold 380)     for at least  95%   (the percentage
threshold) of the time window 375.         Accordingly, the
temperature threshold module 310 and the temperature
difference module 315 output TRUE signals to the motor
prediction module 320, and an alarm 330 is generated by
the MPD module 300.
                                              9940920_1 (GHMatters) P96316.AU.1 2/02/18

[0035]   Although Figs.    6A-B illustrate analysis of
temperature data 305 provided in three data files, each
covering fifteen minute windows of data, the MPD module
300 is also operable to analyze temperature data with a
sliding window 395.     For example, as illustrated in
Fig. 7 and assuming a fifteen minute sliding window,
every minute    (or another increment),      the MPD module 300
analyzes temperature data obtained for the previous
fifteen minutes.     Thus,   at minute 15,    the MPD module
300 analyzes temperature data for the time period from
minute 0 to minute 15;     at minute 16, the MPD module 300
analyzes temperature data from minute 1 to minute 16,
and so forth.
[0036]   The high temperature     threshold     355,       difference
threshold 380, percentage threshold, and time window
are variable depending on the particular motor pair 204
being monitored.     In some instances, the high
temperature threshold 355 is lower or higher than 300
degrees Fahrenheit, such as 200,        250,  275,       325,         350,
and 400 degrees Fahrenheit or another temperature
higher, lower, or in-between 200 and 400 degrees
Fahrenheit.    In some instances, the temperature
difference threshold 380 is higher or lower than 45
degrees Fahrenheit, such as 25,        30,  35,    40,      50,       55,      60,
or 65 degrees Fahrenheit, or another temperature
higher, lower, or in-between 25 and 65 degrees
Fahrenheit.    In some instances, the percentage
threshold is higher or lower than         95%, such as 50%,
75%,  85%,  90%,  99%, or 100%, or another value between
50%  and 100%.    In some instances, the time window may
be greater or less than 15 minutes, such as 5,                     10,       20,
                                                9940920_1 (GHMatters) P96316.AU.1 2/02/18

                                - 18
25,  or 30 minutes, or another time length higher,
lower, or in-between 5 and 30 minutes.        In some
instances, the high temperature threshold 355,
difference threshold 380, percentage threshold, and
time window are variable on-the-fly based on
environmental conditions, machine history, or other
factors.    For instance, the variables can be altered to
be more sensitive    (lower thresholds) or less sensitive
(higher thresholds) as the machine ages or as the
environmental conditions become more or less harsh.
[0037]   Fig. 8 illustrates a method 400 for predicting
motor failure based on temperature characteristics of
the motor pair 204.     The method 400 is described with
reference to the MPD module 300 of Fig. 4.             In step
405,  the MPD module 300 obtains a data file containing
aggregated temperature data obtained by the sensors 206
over a certain time window     (e.g., fifteen minutes).                      In
step 410,   the temperature threshold module 310 and
temperature difference module 315 obtain the
temperature data 305 from the data file including the
temperatures of the motor 204a and 204b collected
during the time window.     In step 415, the temperature
threshold module 310 determines whether the temperature
of either motor 204a or 204b ever exceeded a high
temperature threshold 355,    such as 300 degrees
Fahrenheit, during the time window.      The temperature
threshold module 310 also indicates the result of the
determination to the motor failure prediction module
320.   If neither motor 204a nor motor 204b exceeded the
high temperature threshold 355, the MPD module 300 does
                                           9940920_1 (GHMatters) P96316.AU.1 2/02/18

                               - 19
not predict a motor failure and proceeds to step 420 to
await another data file.
[0038]   If, however,  one of the motors 204a or 204b
exceeded the high temperature threshold 355,            the MPD
module 300 proceeds to step 425 to determine the
temperature differences between the motor 204a and
motor 204b during the time window.     In step 430, the
temperature difference module 315 determines whether
the temperature difference between the motor 204a and
the motor 204b is greater than the difference threshold
380 for a percentage of the time window greater than
the percentage threshold.     If true, the MPD module 300
generates an alarm in step 435.     If false, the MPD
module 300 proceeds to step 420 to await a further data
file.
[0039]   Although the steps of method 400 are depicted
as occurring serially, one or more of the steps may be
executed in parallel or partially in parallel.                   For
instance, step 415 may occur in parallel with step 425
and/or step 430.    Additionally, step 415 may occur
after one or both of    steps 425 and 430.
[0040]   Fig. 9 illustrates a method 450 for predicting
motor failure based on real-time temperature
characteristics of the motor pair 204 using a sliding
window such as sliding window 395.     The method 450 may
be used to monitor real-time temperature data from the
temperature sensors 206, and the sliding window may be
used to analyze temperature data obtained from data
files.    In step 455, the MPD module 300 obtains a
temperature for motor 204a and for motor 204b.                   In step
460,  the temperature threshold module 310 determines
                                           9940920_1 (GHMatters) P96316.AU.1 2/02/18

                              - 20
whether the temperature of the motor 204a or 204b has
exceeded the high temperature threshold 355 in the
previous time window   (e.g., in the previous fifteen
minutes).   If not, the MPD module 300 returns to step
455 to obtain temperatures of the motor pair 204 at the
next time interval.   The next time interval may be,                     for
example, a matter of  seconds, one minute, or several
minutes.   If one of the motors 204a,b exceeded the high
temperature threshold 355, the MPD module 300 proceeds
to step 465.   In step 465, the temperature difference
module 315 determines the temperature differences
between the motor 204a and motor 204b during the
previous time window.    In step 470, the temperature
difference module 315 determines whether the
temperature difference between the motor 204a and the
motor 204b is greater than the difference threshold 380
for a percentage of the previous time window greater
than the percentage threshold.     If true, the MPD module
300 generates an alarm in step 475.     If false, the MPD
module 300 returns to step 455 to obtain temperatures
of the motor pair 204 at the next time interval.
[0041]  Although the steps of method 450 are depicted
as occurring serially, one or more of the steps may be
executed in parallel or partially in parallel.                  For
instance, step 460 may occur in parallel with step 465
and/or step 470.   Additionally, step 460 may occur
after one or both of  steps 465 and 470.
[0042]  The MPD module 300 may be used with or may
implement further temperature-related motor failure
prediction or detection schemes.     For example, if the
temperature of one of the motors 204a,b reaches a very
                                          9940920_1 (GHMatters) P96316.AU.1 2/02/18

                              - 21
high threshold, at any given point, the MPD module 300
may generate an alarm regardless of the temperature of
the other motor 204a,b and the time length at which the
very high threshold was exceeded.    Thus, the MPD module
300 is operable to supplement additional motor and
mining machine monitoring techniques not described
herein.
[0043]  In some embodiments, the motor pair 204 is
cooled by a cooling system, such as a water cooling
circuit.   The cooling system may be a parallel cooling
system that cools both motors 204a,b in parallel, or a
series cooling system that cools the motors 204a,b in
series.   In a parallel cooling system, the motors
204a,b generally have a similar temperature during
normal operation.   In a series cooling system, one of
the motors 204a,b is generally has a higher temperature
than the other of the motors 204a,b during normal
operation.   The discrepancy occurs,  for instance,
because the cooling system cools the motor 204a first,
and the residual cooling agent is then applied to the
motor 204b.
[0044]  For a mining machine 105 with a parallel
cooling system, a single difference threshold             (e.g., 45
degrees Fahrenheit) may be used, as described in the
above examples.   However, for a mining machine 105 with
a series cooling system, the difference threshold may
vary depending on which motor 204a,b has a higher
temperature than the other motor 204a,b.        In an
exemplary embodiment, the mining machine 105 uses a
series cooling system in which the motor 204a generally
operates about 10 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than the
                                         9940920_1 (GHMatters) P96316.AU.1 2/02/18

                               -  22
motor 204b.    In this embodiment, taking the normal
operating temperature difference into account, the
difference threshold is exceeded when either            (1) the
motor 204a is 55 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than the
motor 204b or   (2) the motor 204b is 25 degrees
Fahrenheit warmer than the motor 204a.      Accordingly, in
a mining machine 105 with a series cooling system, the
method 400 and 450 may be implemented such that steps
430 and 470 include a sub-steps of determining which
motor 204a,b has a higher temperature, and then
selecting and using the appropriate difference
threshold based on the determination.      The particular
temperature thresholds are merely exemplary, as other
values may be used in embodiments of the invention.
[0045]  In  some embodiments,  in  place of temperature
sensors  206, another sensor or technique is used to
infer the temperatures of the motor pair 204.                For
example, by monitoring the current drawn by the motor
204a with a current sensor, the controller 200 may
infer the temperature of the motor 204a.         The
controller 200 converts the current to temperature data
305 and provides it to the MPD module 300.            In other
embodiments, motor power consumption, motor power
factor, or other motor parameters can be used to
detector or predict possible motor failure.
[0046]  Furthermore, in some embodiments, the mining
machine 105 may be a mining machine other than the
continuous miner    (see Figs. 2A-C) that has at least one
motor pair, including above-surface mining machines.
For example, the mining machine 105 may be a shuttle
car having one or more traction motor pairs, a flexible
                                          9940920_1 (GHMatters) P96316.AU.1 2/02/18

                             - 23
conveyor train having one or more traction motor pairs,
and a battery-powered haulage vehicle    (also referred to
as a battery hauler) having one or more traction motor
pairs.
[0047]  Moreover, in some embodiments, the motor pair
failure prediction techniques described herein may be
implemented on other machines and vehicles having one
or more motor pairs,  such as electric passenger
vehicles, industrial equipment, watercraft, and the
like.
[0048]  Thus, the invention provides, among other
things, systems and methods for predicting failure of a
motor in a mining machine motor pair.     Various features
and advantages of the invention are  set forth in the
following claims.

requires otherwise due to express language or necessary
implication, the word "comprise" or variations such as
"comprises" or "comprising" is used in an inclusive
