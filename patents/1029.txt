 A circular column formwork system and method of utilisation thereof
Field of the Invention
[1]       This invention relates generally to concrete formwork. More particularly, this invention
relates to a circular column formwork system and method of utilisation thereof.
Background of the Invention
[2]       Formwork for the formation of columns may comprise a plurality of formed steel mould
sections which may be bolted together for forming a cylindrical concrete mould for the pouring of
concrete therein.
[3]       However, such systems are heavy and inconvenient to install and transport and introduce
delays in the installation and dismantling thereof.
[4]       The present invention seeks to provide a circular column formwork system and method of
utilisation thereof, which will overcome or substantially ameliorate at least some of the deficiencies
of the prior art, or to at least provide an alternative.
[5]       It is to be understood that, if any prior art information is referred to herein, such reference
does not constitute an admission that the information forms part of the common general knowledge
in the art, in Australia or any other country.
Summary of the Disclosure
[6]       There is provided herein a lightweight, high-strength circular column formwork system and
method of utilisation thereof which is easier to transport, install and dismantle as compared to certain
prior art circular column formwork arrangements.
[7]       Specifically, the present formwork system comprises a plurality of semicircular wooden panels
which are strapped together and stacked to form a substantially water tight cylindrical concrete
mould.
[8]       The wooden panels are lightweight and therefore easy to transport, install and dismantle.
[9]       Furthermore, the wooden panels are high strength, exhibiting a maximum bearing force of in
excess of 20 kN/m 2 and bending strength of approximately 50 MPa in embodiments.
[10]      In embodiments, the wooden panels are manufactured from layers of fine poplar sheets
curved by hot press and bound utilising WBP glue and layered with a water repellent film.
[11]      As such, the wooden panels are very smooth, providing a superior concrete finish.
Furthermore, utilisation of a release agent increases the number of times the wooden panels may be
reused, such as by up to 8 times or more.
                                                      1

[12]     Lateral edges of the wooden panels may comprise a tongue and groove interlock which seals
the panels together when under compression of the strapping and furthermore holds the edges of the
wooden panels in exact alignment, thereby preventing imperfections in the concrete surface finish.
[13]     In embodiments, for columns in excess of 3 m in height, the wooden panels of two differing
heights may be provided which are ultimately staggered to increase the strength of the system.
[14]     Other aspects of the invention are also disclosed.
Brief Description of the Drawings
[15]     Notwithstanding any other forms which may fall within the scope of the present invention,
preferred embodiments of the disclosure will now be described, by way of example only, with
reference to the accompanying drawings in which:
[16]     Figure 1 shows a circular column formwork system in accordance with an embodiment;
[17]     Figure 2 shows interlocking of adjacent edges of the wooden panels of the formwork system
in accordance with an embodiment;
[18]     Figure 3 shows a top view of the formwork system in accordance with an embodiment; and
[19]     Figure 4 shows the alternate staggering of wooden panels of differing heights together for the
formation of a column in excess of a certain height, such as 3 m, in accordance with an embodiment.
Description of Embodiments
[20]     Figure 1 shows a circular column formwork system 100 comprising a plurality of wooden
panels 101 each having a semicircular cross-section which are strapped together utilising strapping to
form an interior cylindrical profile for the formation of concrete columns.
[21]     Figure 3 shows a top plan view of the system 100 showing the interior cylindrical profile
thereof.
[22]     Each panel 101 may define top, bottom and lateral edges. In this regard, Figure 2 illustrates
the lateral edges of the panels 101 defining a tongue and groove (or similar) interlock which seals the
panels 101 together under compression of the belts 102. Furthermore, the tongue and grooves hold
the lateral edges of the panels 102 in exact alignment, thereby preventing inconsistencies in the
concrete finish.
[23]     In an embodiment, the wooden panels 101 may be manufactured from layers of fine poplar
sheets which are curved by hot press and bound utilising Water Boiled Proof (WBP) glue. Surfaces
thereof may be coated with a water repellent.
[24]     The wooden panels 102 may be provided in differing dimensions and thicknesses for the
formation of differing types of columns. In embodiments, the wooden panels 101 may be provided
comprising the following dimensions and number of components:

[30]     The method of concrete column formation may comprise erecting a reinforcement bar cage
structure and joining a plurality of the semicircular cross-section wooden panels 101 around the
reinforcement bar structure to form an interior cylindrical mould thereabout.
                                                       4

[31]    Interior surfaces of the wooden panels 101 may be coated with a release agent.
[32]    Thereafter, the wooden panels 101 are secured together utilising the strapping. Given the
exemplary embodiments shown in figure 1, an initial bottom strap 102 may be installed. Preferably, a
5 to 10 mm spacer is located thereunderneath to ease the dismantling thereof.
[33]    Thereafter, additional strapping 102 may be installed, including in accordance with the above
belts spacing guidance.
[34]    Specifically, for the first approximately 1.5 m in elevation, strapping 102 may be provided at
200 mm intervals. Thereafter, and up to approximately 4 m in elevation, the strapping 102 may be
spaced at 300 mm intervals. Thereafter, and up to approximately 7 m in elevation, the strapping 102
may be fastened every 400 mm.
[35]    As alluded to above, the strapping 102 forces the edges of the wooden panels 101 together
such that the tongue and groove mechanical interlock seals the edges thereof in a substantially water
tight manner.
[36]    For columns in excess of approximately 3 m, it is preferred that wooden panels 101 of differing
height be utilised in alternatively staggered arrangement as a substantially shown in Figure 4.
[37]    Specifically, Figure 4 illustrates the formation of a 4m high column. As can be seen, the
wooden panels 101 comprise two types of wooden panels 101 of differing heights comprising a
wooden panel of approximately 3 m in height and a second panel of approximately 1 m in height.
[38]    The two lowermost panels comprise the adjoinment of 3 m and 1 m high wooden panels 101
such that a corresponding pair of 1 m and 3 m high wooden panels may be located thereatop
alternately so as to constitute a cylinder of 4 m in elevation.
[39]    Alternatively, for columns of less than approximately 3 m in elevation, a single type of wooden
panel 101 may be employed.
[40]    Thereafter, concrete may be poured within the cylindrical mould formed by the wooden
panels 101, including in accordance with the above pouring guidance. Ideally, the concrete is vibrated
simultaneously.
[41]    For example, for columns having an interior diameter of between approximately 250 and 1200
mm, concrete is ideally poured to a maximum height of approximately 3.2 m and allowed to set prior
to the additional pouring of further concrete thereatop.
[42]    For columns having greater diameter such as, for example, between 1600 and 2400 mm, the
concrete is ideally poured at less than 3 m per hour to a maximum height of approximately 3 m.
[43]    Once the concrete has set, the strapping 102 is unbound and the panels 101 removed, leaving
the formed concrete column in place.
                                                     5
