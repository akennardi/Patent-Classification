CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS
[0001]         This is a national stage entry application of international application
PCT/US2014/036677, filed May 2104, which claims priority to and the benefit of U.S.
provisional patent application nos. 61/818,586, filed 2 May 2013, and 61/873,500, filed 4
September 2013, the disclosure of both of which are incorporated herein by reference in their
entireties.
BACKGROUND INFORMATION
[00021         Bacteria are responsible for a significant amount of disease and infection.
Ridding surfaces of bacteria is desirable to reduce human exposure. Because bacteria have
developed self-preservation mechanisms, they are extremely difficult to remove and/or
eradicate.
[00031         Bacteria can be found in several forms, including planktonic and biofilm. In a
biofilm, bacteria interact with surfaces and form colonies which adhere to a surface and
continue to grow. The bacteria produce exopolysaccharide (EPS) and/or extracellular
polysaccharide (ECPS) macromolecules which crosslink to form matrices or films that help
to keep the bacteria attached to the surface
[0004]         In addition to adhering to surfaces, biofilm matrices protect bacteria against
many forms of attack. Protection likely involves both the small diameter of the flow channels
in the matrix, which restricts the size of molecules that can transport to the underlying
bacteria, and consumption of biocides through interactions with constituent EPS and/or ECPS
macromolecules.
[0005]         Additionally, bacteria in biofilm form are down-regulated (sessile) and not
actively dividing. This makes them resistant to attack by a large group of antibiotics and
antimicrobials, many of which attack the bacteria during the active parts of their lifecycle,
e.g., cell division.
                                                  1

[0006]        Due to protection afforded by the macromolecular matrix and their down
regulated state, bacteria in a biofilm are very difficult to treat. The types of biocides and anti
microbials that can effectively treat bacteria in this form are strongly acidic or oxidizing,
often involving halogen atoms, oxygen atoms, or both. Common examples include con
centrated bleach, strong mineral acids (e.g., HCI), high concentrations of quaternary ammonia
compounds and aldehydes, and H 20 2 . Commonly, large dosages of such chemicals are
allowed to contact the biofilm for extended amounts of time (up to 24 hours in some
circumstances), which makes them impractical for many applications.
[0007]        Formulations that disrupt the macromolecular matrices or bypass and/or disable
the defenses inherent in these matrices have been described in U.S. Pat. Publ. Nos. 2010/
0086576 and 2012/0059263. These formulations are aqueous compositions containing an
acid or base, a buffering salt added at sufficient concentration to yield a relatively high
osmolarity, and large amounts of surfactant, with the solutes creating an osmotic pressure
differential across the bacteria cell wall and the surfactant(s) weakening those walls by
interacting with wall proteins.
[0008]        The foregoing compositions usually do not immediately break down the biofilm
macromolecular matrix and, instead, transform that matrix into a gel-like state, which still
provides some shielding of the bacteria. The aggregate efficacy and disinfection rate of these
compositions thus are limited by the flux rate of the active ingredient(s) moving through the
biofilm matrix and rate of bacterial cell wall degradation. (Disruption of the EPS decreases
the mean free path that the antimicrobial components must travel.)
[0009]        Further, regulatory bodies such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and
Environmental Protection Agency have set threshold amounts for surfactants such as benzal
konium chloride and cetylpyridinium chloride. Any composition that includes such surfac
tants in amounts above those thresholds must be reviewed for safety prior to commercial
introduction for certain applications such as, but not limited to, food contact (without rinsing),
oral rinses, medical instrument sterilization, and skin contact. The foregoing compositions
have surfactant concentrations that usually exceed regulatory threshold amounts.
SUMMARY
[0010]        Provided herein is an antimicrobial composition that is effective against bacteria
in a variety of states, even when the composition is at or near neutral pH values. In addition
                                                 2

to being lethal toward a wide spectrum of gram positive and gram negative bacteria, the
composition also exhibits lethality toward other microbes such as viruses, fungi, molds, yeasts,
and bacterial spores. In many embodiments, the composition has little or no toxicity to
humans and animals.
[0011]        The antimicrobial composition includes a solvent component and a solute
component that is present in an amount sufficient to result in an overall osmolarity of the
composition of at least 500, typically at least 575, and commonly at least 650 mOsm/L. The
solvent component includes one or more organic liquid(s) which are chosen so that the
solvent component exhibits a 6 p value below -15.1, where 6 p is the dipolar intermolecular
force (polarity) Hansen Solubility Parameter (HSP).
[0012]        The high osmolarity of the composition combined with the correct solvent
parameter(s), even in the absence of a surfactant, can quickly solvate a biofilm's macro
molecular matrix and bacterial cell wall proteins. Solvent component(s) exhibiting the
required 6p value have been found to better, more efficiently solubilize microbe cell wall
proteins. By bringing some portion of these cell wall proteins into solution, the entrained
bacteria more easily can be caused to undergo cell leakage which, combined with the high
partial pressure across their cell walls leads to bacterial death. Additionally, enhancing
macromolecular matrix dissolution and increasing its solubility in the solvent system permits
a shorter mean free path for the active components (the chemicals which interact with the
bacteria), thereby increasing their rate and density and decreasing their necessary contact
time and/or severity. These advantages permit use of compositions with lower total ingre
dient concentrations and/or milder conditions (e.g., pH) to be used.
[0013]        While near neutral pH compositions are effective, the pH of the composition
typically is moderately low (about 4 < pH < 6) or moderately high (about 8 < pH < 10).
Higher and lower pH values may increase efficacy by permitting the composition to more
efficiently disrupt the macromolecular matrix of a biofilm, perhaps by reacting or complexing
with crosslinking metal ions.
[0014]        At least some of the osmotically active solutes may include the dissociation
product(s) of one or more acids or bases that are effective at interrupting or breaking ionic
crosslinks in the macromolecular matrix of the biofilm, which facilitates passage of the
solutes, and surfactant if used, through the matrix to the bacteria entrained therein and/or
protected thereby.
                                                  3

[0015]         Also provided are methods of using the foregoing composition. In an exemplary
method, a composition of the type described above can be applied to a biofilm so as to effect
at least a 3 log reduction in the number of live bacteria. For example, application of an
inventive composition to a biofilm tested in accordance with the Center for Disease Control
(CDC) biofilm reactor test method described below can provide at least a 3 log reduction in
the number of live bacteria after a residence time of 5 minutes.
[0016]         Also provided are methods of making the composition. In an exemplary
method, a target 6 p is identified, one or more solvents having a 6p within 0.5 MPa/2 of the
target is/are identified, and the solvent(s) is/are blended with sufficient solutes to provide a
composition having an osmolarity of at least 500, 600, 700, or 800 mOsm/L.
[0017]         In another exemplary method, an aqueous composition that includes one or
more solutes can be modified by addition of one or more organic liquids so as to provide the
composition with a target 6p that is less than the 6 p of the original (aqueous) composition.
[0018]         The composition can be incorporated into a semi-viscous gel or adherent coating
from which the active components can elute over time or remain entrained within the gel or
coating to prevent colonization of the gel or coated surface. In the case of a gel, the compo
sition can employ any of a variety of water-miscible ointment bases, with choice providing
control over elution rate from the gel to provide continuous application of the antimicrobial
composition, to dissolve in place so as to provide a burst dose of product, or to elute to cover
the surface.
[0019]         At times, a single bacterial strain may be of particular interest or concern. In
those cases, a composition that is particularly effective against that bacteria can be formulated
due to differences in cell wall proteins of the different bacterial species. This can be quite
beneficial in situations where eliminating a pathogenic bacteria while not affecting the
remainder of the microflora is desired. (In these cases, the composition likely will employ a
different target 6p than that described above, which is intended for broad spectrum efficacy;
using a polarity at or near that target would be expected to kill all of the microbes exposed to
the composition.)
[0020]         The enhanced effectiveness of the composition permits lower concentrations of
surfactant to be used. Although not absolutely required, the presence of a surfactant,
particularly a polar surfactant, increases the efficacy of these formulations and increases the
rate at which the composition acts against the targeted microbe(s). This is most likely due to
                                                   4

the surfactant inducing cell lysis by attaching to those portions of the cell wall proteins that
are solubilized by the solvent component.

patent application is/are incorporated herein by reference.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0036]        The foregoing summary explanation made mention of HSP, a common method
for predicting whether one material will dissolve in another to form a solution, and the HSP
values for most commonly used solvents are well documented. (A number of alternative
methods to determine the solubility of solutes within a solvent are available. The most
common alternative is the Hildebrand solubility parameter, which measures the cohesive
energy densities of the solvent and solute and compares them for similarity. The polar forces
are not separated from the dispersive and hydrogen bonding forces and, for reasons that
                                                6

become apparent below, this makes the Hildebrand solubility parameter somewhat less
desirable as a measurement/choice tool. Nevertheless, the ordinarily skilled artisan will
recognize that it, as well as other methods, can be used to identify appropriate organic liquids
and/or solvent combinations.)
[0037]           Each component in a mixture or composition has three HSPs: dispersion,
dipole-dipole (polarity) interactions, and hydrogen bonding. These parameters are generally
treated as coordinates in three dimensions, with HSP characterizations being visualized using
a spherical representation: the 3D coordinates are at the center of the sphere with the radius
of the sphere (Ro or "interaction radius") indicating the maximum difference in affinity toler
able for a "good" interaction with a solvent or solute. In other words, acceptable solvents lie
within the interaction radius, while unacceptable ones lie outside it.
[0038]           The distance between the HSPs of two materials in so-called Hansen space (Ra)
can be calculated according to the following formula:
                                             6
                                = 4 ( 6 d2 - d1-     -  6i)2 + (6 h2 - 6hl)2
        6
where     d is the energy from dispersion forces between the molecules, 6p is the energy from
dipole-dipole intermolecular forces, and Sh is the energy from hydrogen bonds between
molecules.
[0039]           A simple composite affinity parameter, the Relative Energy Difference (RED),
represents the ratio of the calculated HSP difference (Ra) to the interaction radius (Ro), i.e.,
RED   =   Ra/Ro. In situations where RED < 1.0, the solubilities of the molecules are suffici
ently similar that one will dissolve in the other. In situations where RED > 1.0, the solubili
ties of the molecules are not sufficiently similar for one to dissolve the other. In situations
where RED ~ 1.0, partial dissolution is possible.
[0040]           Regression analysis of data collected during development of the present
composition has shown that each of the 6 p, 6 d, and Ra values correlates with composition
                                                                                        6
effectiveness. (Because of the direct correlation within this data between the 6p,        d, and Ra
values, compositions that have solvent components that have the stated 6 pvalues also can be
                         6
described in terms of      d and Ra values.)
[0041]           Two regression analysis statistics of interest are the F- and p-values. The F
value is calculated by dividing the test factor (e.g., 6p) mean square by the test error (non
assigned variation) mean square, with higher numbers meaning that the test factor is more
important than random chance. (Mean square is the sum of squares divided by the degrees of
                                                   7

freedom.) The p-value is the probability of obtaining a test statistic that is at least as extreme
as the calculated value if the null hypothesis is true (in this case, probability that the increase
in efficacy is due to random chance and that there is no difference between adding and not
adding solvent).
[0042]         Despite 6p, 6 d, and Ra values all correlating with composition effectiveness, the
F and p-values based on only the 6p value have the highest correlation. Possible reasons for
the dominant importance of the 6p factor include the protein molecules on the surface of the
bacteria being crosslinked in place and the relative unimportance for the entire protein to be
solubilized for efficacy, i.e., only a portion of the protein must be solubilized to allow the
solute, optionally with acid/base and/or surfactant, to induce leakage of cell contents through
or across the membrane.
[0043]         The dipole-dipole interaction Hansen solubility parameter for a particular
solution or mixture of solvents can be calculated according to the following formula:
                                                  n
                                         6p           (6di X Xdi)                    (11)
where Sai is the energy from dipolar intermolecular force for solvent i, xdi is the percentage of
solvent i in the solvent portion of the composition, and n is the total number of solvent
components.
[0044]         Hereinthroughout, the 6 pvalue for a given solvent or combination of solvents is
determined at room temperature (because solubility typically increases with increasing
temperature, meaning that the dissolution rate of the macromolecular matrix and the bacterial
cell wall proteins will increase, the efficacy of the inventive composition is expected to
increase at higher temperatures) and pH values are those which can be obtained from any of a
variety of potentiometric techniques employing a properly calibrated electrode.
[0045]         Turning now to the composition, it can contain as few as two components: a
solvent having a 6 p value low enough to permit some of the bacterial cell wall proteins to
become solubilized and a solute capable of raising the osmolarity of the system to a level
high enough to induce cell lysis. As discussed below, the efficacy of the composition often
can be positively impacted by including sufficient acid or base to move the pH away from
neutral and/or one or more types of surfactant.
                                                    8

[0046]         While ingredients used to prepare or provide such components typically are
ineffective against bacteria in biofilm form when used at concentrations commonly employed
in commercial products, an appropriately fonnulated composition can be very effective at
breaking down or bypassing and disabling biofilm defenses, thereby allowing the composi
tion to solvate some portion of the bacterial cell wall proteins and induce bacterial membrane
leakage, leading to cell lysis, thereby killing even bacteria in a sessile state.
[0047]         The solvent component typically includes water (6p ~ 16.0 MPa") and at least
one organic liquid with a 6 p value lower than that of water.
[0048]         Water commonly is employed in the solvent component of the composition due
to its high solute holding capability (which allows for higher osmolarity compositions),
wetting properties, excellent biocompatibility, environmental friendliness, and low cost.
Essentially any source of water can be used, although those that are relatively free of bacteria
without advance treatment are preferred. The water need not be distilled, deionized, or the
like, although such treatments certainly are not excluded. To enhance solubility of one or
more of the other components of the composition, the water can be heated.
[0049]         Where the solvent component contains water and one or more organic liquids,
the latter acts to reduce the 6 p value of the solvent component to a point where the solvent
system better solubilizes one or more of the proteins of the bacterial cell walls. In other
words, the Ra of the solvent system is such that it is less than or equal to the Ro of at least one
bacterial cell wall protein, i.e., the solvent system-protein RED is no more than -1.0.
[0050]         The 6 pvalue of the overall solvent component is less than 16.0, generally less
than ~15.8, less than ~15.6, less than ~15.4, or less than ~15.2, preferably no more than
 ~15.1, no more than -15.0, no more than ~14.8, no more than -14.6, no more than ~14.4, no
more than ~14.2, or no more than ~14.0 MPa". For broad spectrum effectiveness, the 6 p
value of the overall solvent component generally ranges from 13.1 to 15.7 MPan, commonly
from 13.3 to 15.6 MPa', typically from 13.5 to 15.5 MPa, and most typically from 13.7 to
15.4 MPa.
[0051]         With respect to the organic liquid(s), practically any having a 6 p value less than
 ~2, less than ~3, less than -4, less than ~5, less than ~6, less than ~7, less than ~8, less than
 -9, less than ~10, less than -11, less than -12, less than -13, less than ~14, less than -14.2,
less than -14.4, less than -14.6, less than -14.8, less than -15.0, less than -15.1, less than
                                                   9

 ~15.2, less than -15.3, or less then -15.5 MPa 4 can be used. Non-limiting examples of
organic liquids having such 6p values are provided in Tables 1 and 2 below.
[0052]         When used in conjunction with water, such a material(s) commonly is present at
concentrations of from 0.1 to -33%, 0.25 to -25%, 0.5 to -20%, -1 to -15%, -2 to -12%, -3
to -11%, -4 to ~10%, or -5 to ~-10%, with all of the foregoing representing w/v measure
ments, i.e., grams of organic liquid(s) per liter of total solvent component of the composition.
[0053]         The amount of a given organic liquid (or mixture of organic liquids) to be added
to water can be calculated using formula (11) if a targeted 6 p value is known. Similarly, a
projected 6 , value can be calculated using formula (II) if the amount of organic liquid(s) and
their individual 6p values are known. Methods of formulating antimicrobial compositions
based on both such techniques are contemplated.
[0054]         Although the presence of water in the solvent component is preferred for
reasons explained above, an organic liquid or a mixture of multiple organic liquids, each
having a 6p value less than 15.5 MPa2 or the solution thereof having an overall 6p value less
than 15.5 MPa/, that can solvate the solute component (and other optional ingredients)
without the presence or addition of water can be used.
[0055]         The solvent component can consist of, or consist essentially of, just organic
liquids. In other embodiments, the solvent component can consist of, or consist essentially
of, water and an organic liquid having 6 p value less than 15.5 MPa . In yet other
embodiments, the solvent component can consist of, or consist essentially of, water and two
or more organic liquids with the resulting solvent component having 6 p value less than 15.5
MPa.
[0056]         With respect to organic liquids, preferred compounds include ethers and
alcohols due to their low tissue toxicity and environmentally friendliness. These can be
added at concentrations up to the solubility limit of the other ingredients in the composition.
[0057]         Ether-based liquids that can be used in the solvent component include those
defined by the following general formula
                            R'(CH2)xO-R 2-[O(CH2)z]yZ                            (III)

[0059]        Other organic liquids may be used to achieve efficacy with good miscibility
with water, examples of which include, but are not limited to, ketones such as acetone,
methyl butyl ketone, methyl ethyl ketone and chloroacetone; acetates such as amyl acetate,
ethyl acetate and methyl acetate; (meth)acrylates and derivatives such as acrylamide, lauryl
methacrylate and acrylonitrile; aryl compounds such as benzene, chlorobenzene, fluoro
benzene, toluene, xylene, aniline and phenol; aliphatic alkanes such as pentane, isopentane,
hexane, heptane and decane; halogenated alkanes such as chloroform, methylene dichloride,
chloroethane and tetrachloroethylene; cyclic alkanes such as cyclopentane and cyclohexane;
and polyols such as ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, propylene glycol, hexylene glycol,
and glycerol. When selecting such organic liquids for use in the solvent component of the
                                                12

composition, possible considerations include avoiding those which contain a functional group
that will react with either the acid(s)/base(s) or salt(s) employed in the composition and
favoring those which possess higher regulatory pre-approval limits.
[0060]         Tailoring the solvent concentrations and polarity value might permit targeting of
a particular species or sub-genus of bacteria, for example, where a pathogenic bacteria on a
tissue surface is suppressing native, beneficial flora (e.g., acne treatment). If the targeted
bacteria has a known (or determinable) 6p value that is outside the broad-spectrum efficacy
                     6
region (e.g., it has   p value of 15.4 while the beneficial flora are stable at and somewhat
below that 6 p value), a tailored composition with a solvent component having a 6p value of
 15.4 can be used to eradicate (wholly or substantially) the targeted bacteria while not killing
the beneficial flora to flourish, thereby providing further benefits to the treated tissue after the
pathogenic bacteria is removed.
[0061]         Turning now to the solute component of the antimicrobial composition, the
present compositions have high osmolarities, with efficacy generally increasing as osmolarity
increases. However, in some applications where a reduced osmolarity is necessary or desir
able, efficacy can be maintained at lower osmolarities as long as a threshold value necessary
to induce an osmotic pressure imbalance across the bacterial cell wall is maintained. The
presence of more of these solutes helps to negate the defense mechanisms provided by the
EPS macromolecules of the matrix; in other words, having an abundance of solutes ensures
that, even though many have been consumed by interaction with the macromolecular matrix,
a sufficient amount arrive at the entrained bacteria to induce a high osmotic pressure across
the bacterial cell wall membranes, leading to lysis.
[0062]         This efficacy is independent of the particular identity or nature of individual
compounds of the solute component, although smaller molecules are generally more effective
than larger molecules due to solvent capacity (i.e., the ability to (typically) include more
small molecules in a given amount of solvent component than an equimolar amount of larger
molecules), relative ease of transport through the macromolecular matrix of a biofilm, and
ease of transport across cell wall membranes. Charged, chelating molecules increase disso
lution of the macromolecular matrix by removing the crosslinking metal ions between EPS
chains, and accordingly are a preferred class of solutes.
[0063]         Any of a number of solutes can be used to increase the composition osmolarity,
which increases the differential osmotic pressure across the bacterial cell wall membrane.
                                                  13

[0064]          One approach to achieve increased osmolarity of the composition is by adding
large amounts of ionic compounds (salts); see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 7,090,882.
[0065]          Where one or more organic acids or bases are used in the composition, a
preferred, but not required, approach to increasing osmolarity involves inclusion of salt(s) of
one or more the acid(s) or base(s) or the salt(s) of one or more other organic acids. For
example, where the composition includes an acid, a many fold excess (e.g., 3x to 1Ox,
preferably at least 5 x or even at least 8x) of one or more salts of that acid also can be
included. The identity of the countercation portion of the salt is not believed to be particu
larly critical, with common examples including ammonium ions and alkali metals. Where a
polyacid is used, all or fewer than all of the H atoms of the carboxyl groups can be replaced
with cationic atoms or groups, which can be the same or different. For example, mono-, di
and trisodium citrate all constitute potentially useful buffer precursors. However, because
trisodium citrate has three available basic sites, it has a theoretical buffering capacity up to
50% greater than that of disodium citrate (which has two such sites) and up to 200% greater
than that of sodium citrate (which has only one such site).
[0066]          Regardless of how achieved, the osmolarity of the composition is at least moder
ately high, with an osmolarity of at least ~0.5 Osm/L being preferred for most applications.
Depending on particular end-use application, the composition can have any of the following
concentrations: at least -0.6, at least -0.75, at least - 1.0, at least -1.5, at least -1.75, at least
-2.0, at least -2.25, at least -2.5, at least -2.75, at least -3.0, at least --3.25, and even at least
-3.5 Osm/L (with the upper limit being defined by the solubility limit of the solutes in the
solvent component). Some applications, particularly those involving contact with human or
animal tissue, usually involve relatively lower solute concentrations (e.g., 0.7 to 2.5 Osm/L,
0.8 to 2.45 Osm/L, 0.9 to 2.4 Osm/L, 0.95 to 2.35 Osm/L, and 1 to 2.33 Osm/L), while other
applications, such as those requiring sterilization of inanimate objects, can employ relatively
higher solute concentrations (e.g., 1 to 3.6 Osm/L, 1.1 to 3.5 Osm/L, 1.2 to 3.4 Osm/L, 1.3 to
3.3 Osm/L, 1.4 to 3.2 Osm/L, and 1.5 to 3.1 Osm/L). (As points of comparison, in biological
applications, a 0.9% (by wt.) saline solution, which is -0.3 Osm/L, typically is considered to
be have moderate tonicity, while a 300 (by wt.) saline solution, which is -0.9 Osm/L,
generally is considered to be hypertonic.) Without wishing to be bound by theory,
compositions having higher osmolarities may exert higher osmotic pressure on bacterial cell
walls, which increases susceptibility to interruption by solvent and/or surfactant.
                                                   14

[0067]          The solvent component increases the efficiency of the composition with respect
to both macromolecular matrix dissolution and inducement of cell lysis. Accordingly, lower
osmolarity compositions can be created which provide greater efficacy than counterpart
compositions that do not contain the type of solvent component described above. In view of
this enhanced efficiency, the values in the preceding paragraph can be reduced by 1%, 2%,
3%, 4%, 5%, 6%, 7%, 8%, 9%, 10%, 12%, 14%, 16%, 18% or even as much as -20%.
[0068]          With respect to pH, neutral embodiments of the present compositions can be
efficacious. These neutral pH compositions might have reduced efficacy against some bacteria
(albeit still superior to alternative technologies) compared to low or high pH counterparts but,
conversely, are expected to be more effective than acidic or caustic counterparts for other
species.
[0069]            In general, moving the pH of a composition away from neutral results in
increased efficacy due to an increase in the driving force for chelation of the metal ions
crosslinking the EPS polymers, thereby increasing the rate at which the composition breaks
down (or at least softens) the macromolecular matrix, and increases the efficacy of bacterial
cell wall disruption and attack, thereby increasing the rate of cell lysis. This enhancement
may not be linear, i.e., the enhancement in efficacy may be asymptotic past certain
hydronium ion or hydroxide ion concentrations.
[0070]          Compositions with very high and very low pH values, i.e., pH greater than ~10
or less than ~ 4, respectively, are not as environmental friendly or safe, but can be highly
effective in some applications. For some applications where efficacy is more important than
biocompatibility, the pH of the composition can be as low as -2.0 or as high as -12.5.
[0071]          In vivo applications (including sinus rinses) commonly involve compositions
with 4 < pH < 7. Dermal applications commonly employ compositions with 4 < pH < 9.5.
As long as the pH of the composition is greater than -3 or less than -10, the composition
generally will be biocompatible; specifically, external exposure will result in no long-term
negative dermal effects and ingestion can result biodegradation and/or biosorption, particu
larly if diluted with water soon after ingestion. If the pH is greater than -4 or less than -10,
accidental inhalation or exposure to an aerosolized version of the composition should not
result in laryngospasms or other throat-related damage. However, even those embodiments
of the composition having a pH below -4 or greater than -10 are believed to be significantly
less toxic than presently available commercial products.
                                                  15

[0072]          Hard surface cleaning, such as hospital and food service area disinfection,
applications typically employ compositions with 4 < pH < 6 or 8 < pH < 10. More severe
applications, such as sterilization of medical instruments and equipment, commonly involve
compositions with 2 < pH < 4 or 9 < pH < 12.
[0073]         From the foregoing, one can see that a composition having a pH other than
neutral can be preferred. Preferred compositions include those with a pH value at least 0.5
units away from neutral, those with a pH value at least 1.0 unit away from neutral, those with
a pH value at least 1.5 units away from neutral, those with a pH value at least 2.0 units away
from neutral, those with a pH value at least 2.5 units away from neutral, those with a pH
value at least 3.0 units away from neutral, those with a pH value at least 3.5 units away from
neutral, those with a pH value at least 4.0 units away from neutral, and those with a pH value
at least 4.5 units away from neutral.
[0074]         Acidic forms of the present composition generally have a pH less than 6.8, less
than 6.6, less than 6.4, less than 6.2, less than 6.0, less than 5.8, less than 5.6, less than 5.4,
less than 5.2, less than 5.0, less than 4.8, less than 4.6, less than 4.4, less than 4.2, less than
4.0, less than 3.8, less than 3.6, less than 3.4, less than 3.2, less than 3.0, less than 2.8, less
than 2.6, less than 2.4, less than 2.2, or even -2.0. In terms of ranges, the pH can be from -2
to -6.7, from --2.5 to -6.5, from -2.7 to -6.3, from -3 to -6, from -3.3 to -5.7, or from -3.5
to -5.5.
[0075]         Acidity can be achieved by adding to the solvent component (or vice versa) one
or more acids. Strong (mineral) acids such as HCl, H 2SO 4 , H 3PO 4, HNO 3, H 3B0 3 , and the
like or, preferably, organic acids, particularly organic polyacids may be used. Examples of
organic acids include monoprotic acids such as formic acid, acetic acid and substituted
variants (e.g., hydroxyacetic acid, chloroacetic acid, dichloroacetic acid, phenylacetic acid,
and the like), propanoic acid and substituted variants (e.g., lactic acid, pyruvic acid, and the
like), any of a variety of benzoic acids (e.g., mandelic acid, chloromandelic acid, salicylic
acid, and the like), glucuronic acid, and the like; diprotic acids such as oxalic acid and
substituted variants (e.g., oxamic acid), butanedioic acid and substituted variants (e.g., malic
acid, aspartic acid, tartaric acid, citramalic acid, and the like), pentanedioic acid and
substituted variants (e.g., glutamic acid, 2-ketoglutaric acid, and the like), hexanedioic acid
and substituted variants (e.g., mucic acid), butenedioic acid (both cis and trans isomers),
iminodiacetic acid, phthalic acid, and the like; triprotic acids such as citric acid, 2
                                                   16

methylpropane-1,2,3-tricarboxylic acid, benzenetricarboxylic acid, nitrilotriacetic acid, and
the like; tetraprotic acids such as prehnitic acid, pyromellitic acid, and the like; and even
higher degree acids (e.g., penta-, hexa-, heptaprotic, etc.). Where a tri-, tetra-, or higher acid
is used, one or more of the carboxyl protons can be replaced by cationic atoms or groups
(e.g., alkali metal ions), which can be the same or different.
[0076]         In certain embodiments, preference can be given to those organic acids or bases
which are, or can be made to be, highly soluble in aqueous systems; acids that include groups
that enhance solubility in water (e.g., hydroxyl groups), examples of which include tartaric
acid, citric acid, and citramalic acid, can be preferred in some circumstances. Example of
these bases include NaOH, Na2CO3, and NH 3 . In these and/or other embodiments, preference
can be given to those organic acids and bases which are biocompatible; many of the organic
acids and bases listed above are used in preparing or treating food products, personal care
products, and the like. Alternatively or additionally, preference can be given to those organic
acids and bases which can act to chelate the metallic cations involved in crosslinking the
macromolecular matrix of the biofilm.
[0077]         Basic forms of the present composition generally have a pH greater than -7.5,
generally greater than 8.0, greater than 8.4, greater than 8.6, greater than 9.0, greater than 9.2,
greater than 9.4, greater than 9.6 greater than 9.8, greater than 10.0, greater than 10.2, greater
than 10.4, greater than 10.6, greater than 10.8, greater than 11.0, greater than 11.2, greater
than 11.4, greater than 11.6, greater than 11.8, greater than 12.0, greater than 12.2, greater
than 12.4, or even greater than 12.5. In terms of ranges, the pH can be from -8 to -12.5,
from -8.2 to -12.0, from -8.4 to -11.5, from -8.6 to -11.0, or from -8.8 to -10.5.
[0078]         Basicity is achieved by adding one or more bases such as, but not limited to,
alkali metal salts of weak acids, including acetates, bicarbonates, fulmates, lactates,
phosphates, and glutamates; alkali metal nitrates; alkali metal hydroxides, in particular NaOH
and KOH; alkali earth metal hydroxides, in particular Mg(OH)2; alkali metal borates; NH 3;
and alkali metal hypochlorites (e.g., NaCIO) and bicarbonates (e.g., NaHCO 3 ).
[0079]         The amount of acid or base added to the solvent component can be calculated or
can be added until the composition reaches a desired pH, using standard pH monitoring
equipment to track increases or decreases.
[0080]         In the compositions described in US Patent Publ. Nos. 2010/0086576 and
2012/059263, which were not intended to include one or more organic liquids as part of the
                                                 17

solvent component, inclusion of a surfactant, preferably an ionic surfactant, is required. In
the present composition, surfactant is not required, although inclusion of a surfactant can
increase the ability to both solubilize EPS polymers (by binding to those polymers and
bringing them into solution) and by helping to extract proteins from bacterial cell walls,
leading to cell leakage and lysis.
[0081]         Essentially any material having surface active properties in water can be
employed, regardless of whether water is present in the solvent component of the compo
sition, although those that bear some type of ionic charge are expected to have enhanced
antimicrobial efficacy because such charges, when brought into contact with a bacteria, are
believed to lead to more effective cell membrane disruption and, ultimately, to cell leakage
and lysis. This mechanism can kill even sessile bacteria because it does not involve or entail
disruption of a cellular process.
[00821         Polar surfactants generally are more efficacious than non-polar surfactants.
Ionic surfactants are most effective because they can directly interact with EPS polymers and
bacterial cell wall proteins. For polar surfactants, cationic surfactants are the most effective,
followed by zwitterionic and anionic surfactants. Additionally, smaller surfactants are more
efficacious because they can more easily move through the biofilm macromolecular matrix
and access the entrained bacteria. Another factor which influences the efficacy of ionic
surfactants is the size of side-groups attached to the polar head. Larger size-groups and more
side-groups on the polar head can decrease the efficacy of surfactants.
[00831         Because surfactant is not the only component in the present composition
involved in solubilizing proteins (i.e., solvent assists in this process), non-ionic surfactants
can find more utility in the present composition than in prior compositions which did not
contain solvent. Bacterial cell wall proteins already are solubilized by organic liquid(s) in the
solvent component, allowing the non-ionic surfactants to interact with them by lower-order
mechanisms such as Van der Waals forces.
[0084]         Because surfactants often provide tangential advantages, they can be included in
the composition even where they yield little or no improvement in efficacy above that
afforded by the organic liquid(s).
[0085]         Potentially useful anionic surfactants include, but are not limited to, ammonium
lauryl sulfate, dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate, perflourobutanesulfonic acid, perfloruononanoic
acid, perfluorooctanesulfonic acid, perfluorooctanoic acid, potassium laurylsulfate, sodium

sodium cholate hydrate, sodium deoxycholate, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), sodium
glycodeoxycholate, sodium lauryl sulfate, and the alkyl phosphates set forth in U.S. Pat. No.

[0086]         Potentially useful cationic surfactants include, but are not limited to, cetylpyridi
nium chloride (CPC), cetyl trimethylammonium chloride, benzethonium chloride, 5-bromo
5-nitro- 1,3 -dioxane, dimethyldioctadecylammonium chloride, cetrimonium bromide, diocta
decyldimethylammonium bromide, tretadecyltrimethyl ammonium borine, benzalkonium
chloride (BK), hexadecylpyridinium chloride monohydrate and hexadecyltrimethyl
ammonium bromide, with the benzalkonium chloride being a preferred material.
[0087]         Potentially useful nonionic surfactants include, but are not limited to, sodium
polyoxyethylene glycol dodecyl ether, N-decanoyl-N-methylglucamine, digitonin, n-dodecyl
B-D-maltoside, octyl B-D-glucopyranoside, octylphenol ethoxylate, polyoxyethylene (8) iso
octyl phenyl ether, polyoxyethylene sorbitan monolaurate, and polyoxyethylene (20) sorbitan

dimethylammonio] -1-propane sulfonate, 3 -(decyldimethylammonio) propanesulfonate inner
salt, and N-dodecyl-NN-dimethyl-3 -ammonio- I -propanesulfonate.
[0088]         Potentially useful zwitterionic surfactants include sulfonates (e.g. 3-[(3
cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate), sultaines (e.g. cocamidopropyl
hydroxysultaine), betaines (e.g. cocamidopropyl betaine), and phosphates (e.g. lecithin).
[0089]         For other potentially useful materials, the interested reader is directed to any of a
variety of other sources including, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,107,328 and 6,953,772 as
well as U.S. Pat. Publ. No. 2007/0264310.
[0090]         When a surfactant is included in a formulation, the amount can vary widely
based on a variety of factors including, but not limited to, the age of the biofilm (particularly
whether it is entrenched, a factor which relates to the type of proteins and mass of the macro
molecular matrix), size of the biofilm, amount of surface soiling, the species of bacteria,
whether more than one type of bacteria is present, and the solubility of the surfactant(s).
[0091]         The amount of surfactant generally constitutes greater than -0.02%, typically at
least ~0.04%, typically at least -0.06%, typically at least -0.08%, and typically at least
                                                 19

-0.10% (all w/w, based on the total weight of the composition). Some compositions can
include even more surfactant, for example, at least -0.12%, at least -0.13%, at least -0.14%,
at least -0.15%, at least -0.16%, at least -0.2%, at least -0.25%, at least -0.5%, at least
--0.75%, and even at least 1% of the composition (all w/w, based on the total weight of the
composition). The upper limit of amount of surfactant to be incorporated can be defined by
the solubility limits of the particular surfactant(s) chosen. (Any two of the foregoing
minimum amounts can be combined to provide an exemplary range of amounts of surfactant.)
[0092]         At times, maximum amounts of certain types of surfactants that can be present
in a composition for a particular end use (without specific testing, review and approval) are
set by governmental regulations. For example, compositions intended for food contact
without rinsing can have a maximum amount of 0.02% (by wt.) BK, compositions intended
for use as oral rinsing can have a maximum amount of 0.1% (by wt.) CPC (although an
additional 0.13 % (by wt.) BK can be present as a preservative), and compositions intended
for application to compromised or uncompromised skin can have a maximum amount of
0.13% (by wt.) BK, while compositions involved in applications such as sterilizing medical
instruments can include at least 1% (by wt.), often up to -2% (by wt.) or more of any of a
variety of surfactants.
[0093]         The antimicrobial composition can include a variety of additives and adjuvants
to make it more amenable for use in a particular end-use application without negatively
affecting its efficacy in a substantial manner. Examples include, but are not limited to,
emollients, fungicides, fragrances, pigments, dyes, defoamers, foaming agents, flavors,
abrasives, bleaching agents, preservatives (e.g., antioxidants) and the like. A comprehensive
listing of additives approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is available (by
hyperlink to a zipped text file) at
http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/InfornationOnDrugs/ucm          113978.htm (link active as of filing date
of this application).
[0094]         The composition does not require inclusion of an active antimicrobial agent for
efficacy, but such materials can be included in certain embodiments. Non-limiting examples
of potentially useful active antimicrobial additives include C2-C8 alcohols (other than or in
addition to any used as an organic liquid of the solvent component) such as ethanol, n
propanol, and the like; aldehydes such as gluteraldehyde, formaldehyde, and o-phthalalde
hyde; formaldehyde-generating compounds such as noxythiolin, tauroline, hexamine, urea
                                                 20

formaldehydes, imidazolone derivatives, and the like; anilides, particularly triclocarban;
biguanides such as chlorhexidine and alexidine, as well as polymeric forms such as
poly(hexamethylene biguanide); dicarboximidamides (e.g., substituted or unsubstituted
propamidine) and their isethionate salts; halogen atom-containing or releasing compounds
such as bleach, C1O 2, dichloroisocyanurate salts, tosylchloramide, iodine (and iodophors),
and the like; silver and silver compounds such as silver acetate, silver sulfadiazine, and silver
nitrate; peroxides such as H2 0 2 and peracetic acid; phenols, bis-phenols and halophenols
(including hexachlorophene and phenoxyphenols such as triclosan); and quaternary
ammonium compounds. Additionally, antibiotics may be added for medical applications.
[0095]        Based on the foregoing description, one can see that the non-solvent portion of
the composition can consist of, or consist essentially of, solutes (particularly those deriving
from a buffer precursor, either alone or in combination with other solutes) and ions resulting
from dissociation of an acid or base. In other embodiments, the non-solvent portion can
consist of, or consist essentially of, solutes, ions resulting from dissociation of an acid or
base, and one or more surfactants. In yet other embodiments, the non-solvent portion can
consist of, or consist essentially of, solutes, ions resulting from dissociation of an acid or
base, one or more surfactants and less than 1% w/v bleach solution.
[00961        The composition conveniently can be provided as a solution, as a ready-to-use
product or as a concentrate, although other forms might be desirable for certain end-use
applications. Accordingly, the composition can provided as a soluble powder (for subsequent
dilution, an option which can reduce transportation costs), a slurry, or a thicker form such as
a gel or paste which might be particularly useful for providing increased residence times.
[0097]        The composition can also be provided as a gel or coating that actively elutes out
to disinfect or prevent colonization of a surface.
[0098]        In a gel, a liquid form of the composition can be formulated into an oleaginous,
absorption, water/oil emulsion, oil/water emulsion, or water-miscible carrier base. Examples
of oleaginous bases include white petrolatum and white ointment bases. Examples of
absorption bases include hydrophilic petrolatum, anhydrous lanolin, and those used in such
commercial products as AquabaseTM, AquaphorTM, and PolysorbTM ointments. Water/oil
bases can include cold-cream type bases, hydrous lanolin, and those used in such commercial
products as HydrocreamTM, EucerinTM, and NiveaTM moisturizers. Oil/water bases can
include hydrophilic ointment as well as those used in such commercial products as
                                                  21

DemabaseTM, VelvacholTM, and UnibaseTM ointments. Water-miscible bases include PEG
ointment, cellulosic gels, chitosan gels, polyvinyl pyrollidone, and those used in such
commercial products as PolybaseTM ointment.
[0099]        Examples of solvent-containing compositions that can be provided as stable gels
are shown in Table 3. (By "stable" is meant no substantial loss in efficacy or change in
appearance after room temperature storage for several months.) Each had an effective pH of
4.0 and an osmolarity of 2.33 Osm/L; the first two had 10% w/v entrained solvent (DGME
and IPA, respectively), while the third had 1% w/v entrained phenoxyethanol (because U.S.
Food and Drug Administration regulations permit far less of this material in compositions
intended for dermal contact).

[0100]        Coatings can be formulated from the gel forms above or can be incorporated
into more adherent and stable products, such as latex, silicone, polyurethane, cross-linked
PEG, chitosan gels, or a coalescent such as polyvinyl pyrollidone.
[0101]        Regardless of the physical form of the composition, increasing temperature
and/or agitation during application treatment can beneficially impact total disinfection as well
as disinfection rate. Because the compositions dissolve and/or break up the macromolecular
matrix and extracting bacterial cell wall proteins, applying the composition in a flowing
manner can be beneficial, i.e., partially or fully solvated EPS macromolecules can be
removed from the treatment area, preventing it from blocking treatment chemicals, and fresh
composition can be introduced to the bacterial cell walls.
                                                 22

[0102]         The composition can be employed in a variety of ways. For example, when used
to treat a biofilm on a surface (e.g., cutting board, counter, desk, etc.), the composition can be
applied directly to the biofilm, optionally followed by physical rubbing or buffing, or the
composition can be applied to the rubbing/buffing medium, e.g., cloth. Where a biofilm in an
inaccessible area is to be treated, soaking or immersion of the biofilm in an excess of the
composition can be performed for a time sufficient to essentially solvate the biofilm, which
then can be flushed from the affected area. Regardless of contact method, the surfactant
component(s) are believed to kill significant numbers of bacteria without a need for the
bacteria to be removed from the biofilm or vice versa. The solution may applied by a number
of means including spraying onto or allowed to flow over a surface, applied with or without
pressure, applied with soaked wipes or bandages, or applied ultrasonically.
[0103]         Compositions according to the present invention are more efficacious, both in
terms of total number of bacterial killed and of speed (amount of time needed to achieve an
acceptable amount of bacterial reduction), than otherwise equivalent compositions that do not
contain organic liquid(s) in the solvent component; this is true even where the amount of
surfactant component is greatly reduced or even omitted. Thus, a composition having a
solvent component with a 6 p value of-15.5 will, under the same testing conditions, increase
the amount of reduction of P. aeruginosa by 1 to 3 log and of S. aureus by I to 2 log relative
to an aqueous composition having a 6 p value of 16.0; a composition having a solvent compo
nent with a 6 p value of ~15.0 (i.e., 14.9 - 15.2) will have even greater increases in efficacy,
e.g., on the order of 3 to 6 log for P. aeruginosaand of 2 to 3 log for S. aureus. A graphical
depiction of the impact of the 6 p value of the solvent component on efficacy can be seen in,
for example, FIG. 6.
[0104]         Due to the abundance of microbial contaminations, the present composition has
a large number of potential uses including, but not limited to the cleaning of residential,
commercial and industrial hard surfaces such as bathroom surfaces (floors, countertops,
sinks, drains including floor and sink and shower, toilet bowls, toilet seats, showers including
walls, floors, tubs, shower curtains and shower doors, fixtures, and the like), kitchen surfaces
(such as countertops, floors, stovetops, sinks and drains, cutting boards, pots, pans, dishes,
eating utensils, cooking and serving utensils, dishwasher internal surfaces, food processing
equipment of all types, coffee makers, icemakers, and the like), industrial food processing
surfaces such as for meat, poultry, seafood, dairy, produce and beverage processing (such as
                                                  23

floors, drains, cutting and preparation surfaces, packaging surfaces, processing equipment
holding tanks, cabinets, and surfaces transfer belts fluid lines chambers, and the like), and
food surfaces directly by immersion spray or other means such as animal carcasses,
individual cuts, egg washing, and produce washing.
[01051        The present composition also can be used in the preparation, cleaning and/or
disinfection of medical/healthcare surfaces such as surgical theater objects (e.g., tables, trays,
floors, walls, sinks, drains, any instruments and tools, implants and devices before installation
or being treated in the body during surgery); respirators; reprocessing of devices like scopes
of various types (e.g., endoscopes, gastroscopes, laparoscopes, etc.); dialysis machines;
analyzers of all types such as for blood, urine, or other tissue/fluid samples; reprocessing of
implants or surgical tools, especially heat sensitive where autoclaving can cause issues but
also as a final sterilization before surgical use; patient care surfaces including but not limited
to floors, walls, sinks, fixtures, toilets, drains, bed rails and frames, telephone, audio-visual
remote controllers, tables, chairs, etc.; cleaning of contact lenses, and cleaning of dentures.
[0106]        Biofilms and biofouling greatly decrease the energy efficiency of production
processes by a number of mechanisms, including increasing surface friction, degrading
metallic components, clogging fluid lines, coating surfaces and decreasing heat transfer rates.
The present composition can counteract such deleterious effects in industrial applications
such as cleaning and/or preparing chemical reactors; processing or repackaging equipment,
especially where contamination creates a need for repeated maintenance; treatment of
surfaces where biofouling causes corrosion or reduced heat transfer characteristics detri
mental to function; and oil and gas production for the production and pumping equipment,
downhole applications (e.g., to control biofouling that impedes or reduces production), as
well as anywhere that bacterial contamination creates vapor issues or chemical changes, e.g.
bacterial growth in biodiesel and "souring" of gas during storage.
[01071        Other surfaces that can benefit from applications of the present composition,
regardless of form, include toys, baby pacifiers, door handles, grocery carts, telephones,
remote control devices, the drums of washing machines, humidifiers, dehumidifiers, air
conditioning condensers, automotive ductwork, air handling ductwork, garbage cans, reverse
osmosis filter elements, and ion exchange filter elements.
[0108]        Other potential applications for the present composition include treatment of
textiles and fabrics such as general clothes washing especially for malodor, hospital linen for
                                                    24

disinfection or sanitization, baby laundry for disinfection or sanitization, and bandages;
treatment of living human or animal tissue such as for treating rhinosinusitis (either directly
clearing the sinus cavity or combined with a packing material), otitis, surgical site prep,
surgical wash, rinsing of surgical sites during operation or before, inclusion in the body to
remain after closure to provide extended antibacterial protection especially when provided as
a gel form within a surgical site directly or when left to surround an implant or implanted
device such as a pacemaker, treatment of wounds either as a wash as a gel intended to be left
for an extended period on the wound or intended for use as a treatment solution as in negative
pressure wound therapy devices, treatment of cystic fibrosis to remove biofilm from the
lungs, treatment of tonsils and adenoids, as an antibacterial hemostat when combined with a
suitable clotting agent, oral care as a rinse or toothpaste, rinsing of impacted teeth after root
canals, toe fungus, yeast infections, diaper rash, acne, hand sanitizer, skin cleanser, for
treatment of udder rot, hoof rot, metritis, dairy teat dip, and the like; and flow channel-type
devices such as dental unit water lines, re-circulating cooling/heating loops (either open or
closed) such as in cooling towers, heat exchangers, manufacturing equipment or laboratory
equipment, re-circulating loops for lubricants and cutting fluids, processing equipment such
as chemical reactors, fermenting tanks, liquid and beverage packaging, any system that may
contain any or all of holding tanks, fluid transfer lines, valves, joints or dispensers for
aqueous based systems, condensate collection and transfer lines, vapor lines especially where
water vapor is present, and tanker transports such as in over the road trucking or rail.

EXAMPLES

microbial compositions against bacteria in a variety of formats. Brief descriptions of these

    Quantitative carrier test (QCT), ASTM test method E2197-02 ( 9): To three separate
         vessels, each containing 10 mL KH 2 PO 4 solution (-30% w/v in water), are added,
         respectively, 0.5 g tryptone, 0.5 g bovine serum albumen, and 0.04 g bovine mucin;
         each was sterilized separately. In a separate container, 340 pL microbial suspension
         (bacteria grown from a suspension originally obtained from ATCC of Manassas,
         Virginia), 25 tL of the BSA solution, 100 1 iL of the mucin solution, and 35 pL of the
         tryptone stock are added together to provide a soil loaded bacterial suspension which
         is used immediately after preparation. A 10 ptL aliquot of the soil loaded bacterial
         suspension is applied to a clean stainless steel disk and allowed to dry before a 50 ptL
         aliquot of antimicrobial composition is applied. Results of this test are reported as
         reductions from control (logarithmic scale).

     Biofilm CDC reactor test, ASTM E2871       -12:  Biofilms are grown on coupons in a CDC
         reactor (ASTM E-2562). Upon removal, the coupons are immersed in sterile buffered
         water to remove planktonic bacteria before being placed in sterile 50 mL conical
         tubes and having 4 mL antimicrobial composition added thereto. After a specified
         dwell time (e.g., 3, 5 or 10 minutes), 36 mL of a Day/Engler broth (available from a
         variety of commercial sources such as Sigma-Aldrich) is added to the tube to stop any
         further antimicrobial activity of the composition, and the remaining bacterial load is
         quantified. Results are reported as reductions from control (logarithmic scale).
     Planktonic bacteria test (AOAC 955.14, 955.15, 964.02): A soil load (~10      6  suspended
         bacteria) is applied to a number of Peni cylinders (typically 60), which are placed in
         sterile test tubes containing 10 mL of an antimicrobial composition. After the
         treatment time (e.g., 3, 5 or 10 minutes), the cylinders are transferred to test tubes
         containing growth media, a neutralizer (e.g., Day/Engler broth), and a growth indica
         tor such as a pH-sensitive dye that changes color if the pH drops below neutral (as
         would happen during cell respiration by any bacteria living on the Peni cylinder after
         treatment). Visual color inspection is performed, with results being provided as an
         amount of time (in seconds) required to completely disinfect a tested surface. (Where
         60 test cylinders are run, 58 must lack the color change to achieve a passing result.)
[0112]          After precursor buffering compositions A through M from Table 4 were
prepared, 37% (by wt.) HCl or 50% (by wt.) NaOH was added to achieve the target pH.
                                           Examples 1-24
[0113]          Twenty four antimicrobial compositions were prepared: examples 1-8 contained
 1.78 g (0.008 mol) SDS anionic surfactant, examples 9-16 contained 2.10 g (0.008 mol) BK
cationic surfactant, and examples 17-24 contained no added surfactant.
[0114]          All these compositions were prepared so as to have effective solute concentrations
of 2.33 Osm/L, with half of the compositions from each of the three groups being acidic
(pH   = 4.0) and the other half being alkaline (pH = 10.0):
         acidic (examples 1-4, 9-12 and 17-20)         - 127.0 g/L citric acid and 112.5 g/L
                                                         sodium citrate dihydrate, and
         alkaline (examples 5-9, 13-16 and 21-24) - 19.4 g/L NaOH and 65.0 g/L KH 2 PO 4.
                                                 28

[0115]        Each composition was prepared in a 100 mL glass vessel by adding surfactant
(if used) with sufficient water to disperse it, the buffer precursor (salt), and then the acid or
base.
[0116]        To each of the compositions of examples 1-4 was added, respectively, 10 g of
one of the following organic liquids (with the parenthetical numbers being the 6p values, in
MPa., of the solvent components of the resulting compositions): PGME (14.96), DGME
(15.32), IPA (15.01) or DMSO (16.04). Sufficient water then was added to bring each
composition to 100 mL before the vessel was covered and stored at room temperature
(-23-C).
[0117]        The foregoing solvent and water addition was repeated for the compositions of
the other groups, i.e., examples 5-8, 9-12, 13-16, 17-20 and 21-24.
[0118]        The compositions are summarized below in Table 4.

[0120]       Bacterial reduction versus   p values  of the solvent component of the
compositions were plotted, with the results being shown as follows:

           FIG. 3b      -    P. aeruginosa CDC reactor (biofilm), pH       = 10 composition
[0121]         In each of these plots, a definite increase in efficacy can be seen when the 6p
value falls below about 15.2 MPa". The exact point where the discontinuity begins varies
somewhat between the planktonic bacteria and biofilm tests, but the transition occurs at
 15.2 < 6p < 15.4 MPan.
[0122]         Further, the plots for S. aureus at pH  =  10 with cationic surfactant (FIGs. lb and
2b) indicate efficacy beyond the theoretical bound. Without wishing to be bound by theory, a
different (sub)section of the proteins on the wall of this bacteria might be solubilized at the 6p
value corresponding to the anomalous log reduction data point.
[0123]         The data from Table 5 also seem to indicate that pH     =  4 compositions generally
are somewhat more effective than pH       =  10 compositions and that cationic surfactant
containing compositions are more effective than anionic surfactant-containing and surfactant
free counterparts, although the latter still demonstrated significant antimicrobial capability.
[0124]         After the foregoing testing was completed, the correlation of each of the HSPs
to the results was evaluated. Basic regression analysis was performed for the results of each
individual parameter and for the interaction radius value. The fit and probabilty results for
this regression analysis are shown below in Table 6.

parameters follow the same trends when placed into solution. As such, strong correlation
between these parameters will exist when a regression is performed versus efficacy.
Accordingly, the 6d value is also expected to be useful in formulating compositions and, in
                                                  32

that case, the point of delimination for solution efficacy will be functionally equiavalent to

[0128]         The pH  =  10 and 2.33 Osm/L compositions from Examples 1-24 and 25-32 were
identified, and their log reduction vs. 6 p value data were plotted, with the results being shown
in FIGs. 4 (S. aureus) and 5 (P. aeruginosa),which show significant enhancement in anti
microbial activity near 6 p value : 15.3 MPa".

[0129]        To eliminate test-to-test variation and remove potentially confounding effects of
using different solvents, the biofilm testing employed in Examples 1-24 was perfonned on
compositions having varying concentrations of one solvent (PGME) at concentrations of
from 0 to 10% w/v and varying amounts of exposure time.
[01301        The PGME was added to a composition containing 2.1 g/L BK, 19.4 g/L NaOH,
and 65.0 g/L KH 2 PO 4 (pH   = 10.0 and 2.33 Osm/L).
[0131]        Bacterial reduction data from these tests plotted against 6p values are shown in
FIG. 6, which indicates that composition efficacy increases dramatically as the 6p value of the
solvent component decreases and with increasing application time. (The 10 minute applica
tions at 6p = 15.38 and 6p =  15.17 MPaV and the 5-minute application at 6p = 15.17 MPa
yield complete disinfection of the biofilm. The composition that did not contain any added
PGME was not tested at a 3-minute application time.)

[0132]        To evaluate the efficacy of antimicrobial compositions in a medical application,
testing was undertaken using a mixed-species biofilm wound model using a drip flow reactor.
Mixed species biofilms usually are more difficult to disinfect and produce a wider variance of
data.
[0133]        A mixed species biofilm of P. aeruginosaand S. aureus was grown on hydroxy
apatite coated microscope slides in a drip flow reactor at a low flow rate (10 mL/hour) to
yield a biofilm of ~107 to 108 CFU/cm.
[0134]        Test compositions then were applied to all but one of the slides for 5 minutes
with no flow. After the slides were harvested, log reduction values were obtained by deter
mining the amount of bacteria on the control slide and the test samples and subtracting the
latter from the former.
[0135]        The compositions tested were prepared similarly to those set forth above in
Examples 1-24. The particular amounts of the various components were as follows:
         examples 44-49 - 2.1 g/L BK, 21.7 g/L NaOH, 74.7 g/L KH 2 PO 4 (pH = 9.0 and

                          880 mOsm/L),
       examples 57-59  - 1.3 g/L BK, 1.0 g/L Na2CO3, 75.0 g/L NaHC03 (pH        = 8.0 and
                          1.76 Osm/L),

lower    p values exhibited increased efficacy relative to similar compositions having higher 6p
values, although some variation due to buffer system and particular bacteria was noted.

[0142]        Bacterial reduction versus 6 p value of the solvent component of the

follows:
          FIG. 7     -    S. aureus CDC reactor (biofilm), pH = 10 composition, and
          FIG. 8     -    P. aeruginosaCDC reactor (biofilm), pH = 10 composition.
[0143]        FIGs. 7-8 visually demonstrate that, as 6p value decreases, efficacy against both
S. aureus and P. aeruginosaincreases, with the effect against the latter being more profound.
[0144]        Bacterial reductions versus pH of the compositions of Examples 9 and 11, 13
and 15, and 65-66 (all of which had 10% (w/v) solvent, 2.1 g/L cationic surfactant, and 2.33
Osm/L) were plotted, with the results being shown in FIG. 9 (S. aureus) and FIG. 10 (P.
aeruginosa). These plots seem to indicate that acidic compositions (lower pH values) have
greater efficacy than higher pH solutions for S. aureus, while compositions with more neutral
values are quite effective against P. aeruginosa. Based on this, composition osmolarity
                                                38

appears to impact efficacy more strongly than pH, a characteristic that suggests that
moderate, surface-friendly compositions still can be very effective against target bacteria.
[0145]        Bacterial reductions versus effective solute concentrations of the compositions
from Examples 9, 11, 13, 15, 60, 67-68 and 70 (all of which contained 2.1 g/L cationic
surfactant and 10% w/v organic liquid) were plotted, with the results being shown in FIG. 11
(S. aureus) and FIG. 12 (P. aeruginosa). In FIG. 11, the low pH compositions appear to
present a trend toward increased efficacy with increasing effective solute concentration, but
the high pH compositions do not seem to follow this trend. In FIG. 12, the DGME
containing compositions follow the expected trend of increased efficacy with increasing
effective solute concentration, but the IPA-containing compositions do not.

[0146]        Additional planktonic (AOAC) testing was performed to determine the effects
of varying the 6p value of the solvent component on the efficacy of compositions against soil
loaded S. aureus bacteria. Each composition employed KH 2 PO 4 as buffer and IPA as solvent.
The osmolarity of each composition was 2.33 Osm/L.
[0147]        Thirty portions of each compositions were tested at 300 seconds each (soil
loaded bacteria samples at ~106 CFU/carrier.) Any visual indication of growth (i.e., color
change from yellow to purple) was given a failing grade.

[0149]         The data of Table 10 are plotted in FIGs. 13 (efficacy of the compositions as a
function of the 6p value of the solvent component) and 14 (efficacy of the compositions as a
function of concentration of surfactant).
[0150]         FIG. 13 clearly indicates a correlation between efficacy and decreasing 6 p value.
The graph also seems to indicate that higher pH compositions retain efficacy even at higher
6p values but that pH has little effect as the 6 pvalues pass a certain inflection point.
[0151]         FIG. 14 indicates little effect due to change in surfactant concentration, although
the effect of increasing the amount of IPA has a very large influence on efficacy, presumably
due to the concomitant decrease in 6p value of the solvent component.
