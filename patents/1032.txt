                                           ABSTRACT
The invention relates to inhibition of wild-type and certain mutant forms of human histone
methyltransferase EZH2, the catalytic subunit of the PRC2 complex which catalyzes the
mono- through tri-methylation of lysine 27 on histone H3 (H3-K27). In one embodiment the
inhibition is selective for the mutant form of the EZH2, such that trimethylation of H3-K27,
which is associated with certain cancers, is inhibited. The methods can be used to treat
cancers including follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Also
provided are methods for identifying small molecule selective inhibitors of the mutant forms
of EZH2 and also methods for determining responsiveness to an EZH2 inhibitor in a subject.

                                    FIELD OF THE INVENTION
          This invention relates to inhibition of wild-type and certain mutant forms of human
  histone methyltransferase EZH2, the catalytic subunit of the PRC2 complex which catalyzes the
  mono- through tri-methylation of lysine 27 on histone H3 (H3-K27), methods for treating
  cancers including follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and
  methods for determining responsiveness to an EZH2 inhibitor in a subject.
                                            BACKGROUND
          In eukaryotic cells DNA is packaged with histones to form chromatin. Approximately
  150 base pairs of DNA are wrapped twice around an octamer of histones (two each of histones
  2A, 2B, 3 and 4) to form a nucleosome, the basic unit of chromatin. Changes in the ordered
  structure of chromatin can lead to alterations in transcription of associated genes. This process is
  highly controlled because changes in gene expression patterns can profoundly affect fundamental
  cellular processes, such as differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis. Control of changes in
  chromatin structure (and hence of transcription) is mediated by covalent modifications to
9 histones, most notably of their N-terminal tails. These modifications are often referred to as
  epigenetic because they can lead to heritable changes in gene expression, but they do not affect
  the sequence of the DNA itself. Covalent modifications (for example, methylation, acetylation,
  phosphorylation and ubiquitination) of the side chains of amino acids are enzymatically
  mediated.
5         The selective addition of methyl groups to specific amino acid sites on histones is
  controlled by the action of a unique family of enzymes known as histone methyltransferases
                                                     1

        WO 2013/138361                                                          PCT/US2013/030565
  (HMTs). The level of expression of a particular gene is influenced by the presence or absence of
  one or more methyl groups at a relevant histone site. The specific effect of a methyl group at a
  particular histone site persists until the methyl group is removed by a histone demethylase, or
  until the modified histone is replaced through nucleosome turnover. In a like manner, other
  enzyme classes can decorate DNA and histones with other chemical species, and still other
  enzymes can remove these species to provide control of gene expression.
           The orchestrated collection of biochemical systems behind transcriptional regulation
  must be tightly controlled in order for cell growth and differentiation to proceed optimally.
  Disease states result when these controls are disrupted by aberrant expression and/or activity of
  the enzymes responsible for DNA and histone modification. In human cancers, for example,
  there is a growing body of evidence to suggest that dysregulated epigenetic enzyme activity
  contributes to the uncontrolled cell proliferation associated with cancer as well as other cancer
  relevant phenotypes such as enhanced cell migration and invasion. Beyond cancer, there is
  growing evidence for a role of epigenetic enzymes in a number of other human diseases,
  including metabolic diseases (such as diabetes), inflammatory diseases (such as Crohn's
  disease), neurodegenerative diseases (such as Alzheimer's disease), and cardiovascular diseases.
  Therefore, selectively modulating the aberrant action of epigenetic enzymes holds great promise
  for the treatment of a range of diseases.
  Histone Methyltransferase EZH2
           Polycomb group (PcG) and trithorax group (trxG) proteins are known to be part of the
  cellular memory system. Francis et al. (2001) Nat Rev Mol Cell Biol 2:409-21; Simon et al.
  (2002) Curr Opin Genet Dev 12:210-8. Both groups of proteins are involved in maintaining the
  spatial patterns of homeotic box (Hox) gene expression, which are established early in
  embryonic development by transiently expressed segmentation genes. In general, PcG proteins
5 are transcriptional repressors that maintain the "off state," and trxG proteins are transcriptional
  activators that maintain the "on state." Because members of PcG and trxG proteins contain
  intrinsic histone methyltransferase (HMTase) activity, PcG and trxG proteins may participate in
  cellular memory through methylation of core histones. Beisel et al. (2002) Nature 419:857-62;

           Biochemical and genetic studies have provided evidence that DrosophilaPcG proteins
  function in at least two distinct protein complexes, the Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1)
  and the ESC-E(Z) complex (also known as Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2)), although
  the compositions of the complexes may be dynamic. Otte et al. (2003) Curr Opin Genet Dev
  13:448-54. Studies in Drosophila(Czermin et al. (supra); Muller et al. (supra)) and mammalian
  cells (Cao et al. (supra); Kuzmichev et al. (supra)) have demonstrated that the ESC-E(Z)/EED
  EZH2 (i.e., PRC2) complexes have intrinsic histone methyltransferase activity. Although the
  compositions of the complexes isolated by different groups are slightly different, they generally
  contain EED, EZH2, SUZ12, and RbAp48 or Drosophilahomologs thereof. However, a
  reconstituted complex comprising only EED, EZH2, and SUZ12 retains histone
  methyltransferase activity for lysine 27 of histone H3. US Patent 7,563,589 (incorporated by
  reference).
           Of the various proteins making up PRC2 complexes, EZH2 (Enhancer of Zeste Homolog
  2) is the catalytic subunit. The catalytic site of EZH2 in turn is present within a SET domain, a
  highly conserved sequence motif (named after Su(var)3-9, Enhancer of Zeste, Trithorax) that is
  found in several chromatin-associated proteins, including members of both the Trithorax group
  and Polycomb group. SET domain is characteristic of all known histone lysine
  methyltransferases except the H3-K79 methyltransferase DOTI.
           In addition to Hox gene silencing, PRC2-mediated histone H3-K27 methylation has been
  shown to participate in X-inactivation. Plath et al. (2003) Science 300:131-5; Silva et al. (2003)
  Dev Cell 4:481-95. Recruitment of the PRC2 complex to Xi and subsequent trimethylation on
  histone H3-K27 occurs during the initiation stage of X-inactivation and is dependent on Xist
  RNA. Furthermore, EZH2 and its associated histone H3-K27 methyltransferase activity was
5 found to mark differentially the pluripotent epiblast cells and the differentiated trophectoderm.
  Erhardt et al. (2003) Development 130:4235-48).
           Consistent with a role of EZH2 in maintaining the epigenetic modification patterns of
  pluripotent epiblast cells, Cre-mediated deletion of EZH2 results in loss of histone H3-K27
  methylation in the cells. Erhardt et al. (supra). Further, studies in prostate and breast cancer cell
9 lines and tissues have revealed a strong correlation between the levels of EZH2 and SUZ12 and
                                                      3

Varambally et al. (2002) Nature 419:624-9), indicating that dysfunction of the PRC2 complex
may contribute to cancer.
        Recently, somatic mutations of EZH2 were reported to be associated with follicular
lymphoma (FL) and the germinal center B cell-like (GCB) subtype of diffuse large B-cell
lymphoma (DLBCL). Morin et al. (2010) Nat Genet 42:181-5. In all cases, occurrence of the
mutant EZH2 gene was found to be heterozygous, and expression of both wild-type and mutant
alleles was detected in the mutant samples profiled by transcriptome sequencing. Currently, the
standard of care for the treatment of most cases of DLBCL is the R-CHOP regimen. However,
the outcome of this regimen is far from satisfactory. Therefore, there is a great medical need to
identify novel and effective therapies, optionally based on the genetic profiles of the subject.
                               SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
        The invention is based upon the discovery that cells expressing certain EZH2 mutants are
more responsive to EZH2 inhibitors than cells expressing wild type EZH2.
        The invention features a method for treating or alleviating a symptom of cancer or
precancerous condition in a subject administering to a subject expressing a mutant EZH2
comprising a mutation in the substrate pocket domain as defined in SEQ ID NO: 6 a
therapeutically effective amount of an EZH2 inhibitor.
        The invention also features a method (or an in vitro method) of determining a
responsiveness of a subject having a cancer or a precancerous condition to an EZH2 inhibitor by
providing a sample from the subject; and detecting a mutation in the EZH2 substrate pocket
domain as defined in SEQ ID NO: 6; and the presence of said mutation indicates the subject is
responsive to the EZH2 inhibitor.
        The invention also provides a use of an EZH2 inhibitor in a therapeutically effective
amount in the manufacture of a medicament for treating or alleviating a symptom of cancer or
precancerous condition in a subject expressing a mutant EZH2 comprising a mutation in the
substrate pocket domain as defined in SEQ ID NO: 6.

  residue alanine (A) at amino acid position 677 of SEQ ID NO: 1 (A677G); a substitution of
  valine (V) for the wild type residue alanine (A) at amino acid position 687 of SEQ ID NO: 1
  (A687V); a substitution of methionine (M) for the wild type residue valine (V) at amino acid

  arginine (R) at amino acid position 685 of SEQ ID NO: 1 (R685H); a substitution of cysteine (C)
  for the wild type residue arginine (R) at amino acid position 685 of SEQ ID NO: 1 (R685C); a
  substitution of phenylalanine (F) for the wild type residue tyrosine (Y) at amino acid position
  641 of SEQ ID NO: 1 (Y641F); a substitution of histidine (H) for the wild type residue tyrosine
  (Y) at amino acid position 641 of SEQ ID NO: 1 (Y641H); a substitution of asparagine (N) for
  the wild type residue tyrosine (Y) at amino acid position 641 of SEQ ID NO: 1 (Y641N); a
  substitution of serine (S) for the wild type residue tyrosine (Y) at amino acid position 641 of
  SEQ ID NO: 1 (Y641S); and a substitution of cysteine (C) for the wild type residue tyrosine
  (Y) at amino acid position 641 of SEQ ID NO: 1 (Y641C).
           The subject of the present invention includes any human subject who has been diagnosed
  with, has symptoms of, or is at risk of developing a cancer or a precancerous condition. For
  example, the cancer is lymphoma, leukemia or melanoma. Preferably, the lymphoma is non
  Hodgkin lymphoma, follicular lymphoma or diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Alternatively, the
  leukemia is chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). The precancerous condition is
  myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS, formerly known as preleukemia).

                               BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES
           Figure 1 is two graphs establishing that B-cell lymphoma-associated mutants of EZH2
  are active histone methyltransferases. In vitro methyltransferase activity of PRC2 complexes
  containing wild-type and various Y641 mutants of EZH2 was measured as (A) methyl transfer
  reactions using a peptide (H3 21-44) as substrate, and (B) methyl transfer reactions using avian
  nucleosomes as substrate. Symbols: wild-type (e), Y641F (o), Y641H (:), Y641N (m), and
  Y641S (A). CPM is counts per minute, referring to scintillation counting as a result of             3H
  radiation.
           Figure 2 is four graphs establishing that PRC2 complexes containing mutant EZH2
  preferentially catalyze di- and tri-methylation of histone H3-K27. (A) Methyltransferase activity
  of mutant and wild-type (WT) complexes on unmethylated peptide (open bars), monomethylated
  peptide (hashed bars), and dimethylated peptide (closed bars). (B) Affinity for peptide substrates
  as judged by K 1/2 is similar across all peptide methylation states for PRC2 complexes containing
  wild-type (o),Y641F (e), Y641H (o), Y641N (m), and Y641S (A) EZH2. Note that the variation
  in K1/2 values across all substrates and all enzyme forms is less than 3.5-fold. For any particular
  methylation state of substrate the variation in K 1/2 value is less than 2-fold. (C) Enzyme turnover
  number    (kcat) varies with substrate methylation status in opposing ways for WT and Y641
  mutants of EZH2. The       kcat decreases with increasing K27 methylation states for wild-type
  (o), but increases for Y641F (e), Y641H (o),D Y641N (m), and Y641S (A) mutants of EZH2.
5 (D) Catalytic efficiency (kcat/Ki/ 2 ) decreases with increasing K27 methylation states for wild-type
  (o), but increases for Y641F (e), Y641H (o), Y641N (m), and Y641S (A) mutants of EZH2. In
  panels B-D, the lines drawn to connect the data points are not intended to imply any
  mathematical relationship; rather, they are merely intended to serve as visual aides.
           Figure 3A is a trio of graphs depicting predicted relative levels of H3-K27me3 (top
9 panel), H3-K27me2 (middle panel), and H3-K27mel (bottom panel) for cells containing
                                                         6

        WO 2013/138361                                                         PCT/US2013/030565
  different EZH2 mutants. Simulations were performed using a coupled enzyme steady state
  velocity equation and the steady state kinetic parameters shown in Table 2. All values are
  relative to the homozygous WT EZH2-containing cells and assume saturating concentrations of
  intracellular SAM, relative to Km and intracellular nucleosome concentrations similar to Km.
          Figure 3B is a series of Western blot analyses of relative patterns of H3-K27 methylation
  status for lymphoma cell lines homozygous for WT EZH2, or heterozygous for the indicated
  EZH2 Y641 mutation. Panels from top to bottom depict the results of probing with antibodies
  specific for the following: total EZH2; H3-K27me3; H3-K27me2; H3-K27mel; and total
  histone H3 as loading control.
          Figure 4 depicts selected proposed mechanisms leading to aberrantly high levels of
  trimethylation on histone H3-K27 in cancer. These include: a) mutation of Y641 in EZH2
  resulting in a change in substrate preference from the nonmethylated to the mono- and di
  methylated histone H3-K27; b) overexpression of EZH2; c) mutations in UTX that inactivate
  enzyme function, causing a decrease in demethylation of H3-K27me3; and d) overexpression of
  the PRC2 complex subunit PHF19/PCL3 that leads to increases in recruitment of the PRC2
  complex to specific genes and an increase in histone H3-K27 trimethylation. In all four models
  the alteration leads to aberrant histone H3-K27 trimethylation in the proximal promoter regions
  of genes resulting in transcriptional repression of key genes in cancer.
          Figure 5 depicts a SDS-PAGE gel showing that the expression levels of each of the five
  component PRC2 complexes are similar with mutant and wild-type EZH2.
          Figure 6 is a pair of tables showing that mutant and wild-type (WT) PRC2 complexes
  display strong substrate preference for H3-K27-containing peptides. Each enzyme was tested
  against a panel of overlapping 15-mer peptides covering all of H3 and H4. Activity was
  measured as velocity (CPM per minute), and the reported value represents the mean of two
5 independent determinations for each reaction. For all the complexes the most favored peptide
  was H3:16-30. WT complex had greater than 6-fold more activity against this peptide than any
  of the mutant complexes.
          Figure 7 is a graph depicting inhibitory potency of S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine (SAH)
  against EZH2 WT and Y641 mutants of EZH2. The X axis shows log concentration of SAH;

           Figure 8 is a graph depicting inhibitory potency of Compound 75 against EZH2 WT and
  Y641 mutants of EZH2. The X axis shows log concentration of Compound 75; the Y axis shows
  percent inhibition.
           Figure 9 depicts a Western Blot analysis of relative levels of H3-K27mel, me2 and me3
  in a cell line pane, including multiple DLBCL lines expressing WT or Y641 mutatnt EZH2.
  Histones were extracted from the cell lines shown, fractionated by SDS-PAGE on a 4-20% gel,
  transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and probed with antibodies to Histone H3, H3-K27mel,
  me2, or me3..
           Figure 10 depicts an immunocytochemistry analysis of H3 and H3-K27me3 levels in a
  panel of WT and Y641 mutant lymphoma cell lines. Cell pellets from the indicated cell lines
  were fixed and embedded in paraffin. Slides were prepared and levels of H3 and H3-K27me3
  were evaluated by immunocytochemistry using antibodies to histone H3, or H3-K27me3.
           Figure 11 depicts an immunocytochemistry analysis of H3 and H3-K27me2 levels in a
  panel of WT and Y641 mutant lymphoma cell lines. Cell pellets from the indicated cell lines
  were fixed and embedded in paraffin. Slides were prepared and levels of H3 and H3-K27me2
  were evaluated by immunocytochemistry using antibodies to histone H3, or H3-K27me2.
           Figure 12 is a graph depicting the inhibition of global H3-K27me3 levels by EZH2
  inhibitor treatment in Y641 mutant WSU-DLCL2 cells. WSU-DLCL2 cells were treated for 4
  days with the indicated concentrations of EZH2 inhibitor A or B. Following compound
  treatment, histones were extracted, fractionated by SDS-PAGE on a 4-20% gel, transferred to
  nitrocellulose membranes, and probed with antibodies to Histone H3, or H3-K27me3.
           Figure 13 is a graph showing that the EZH2 inhibitors can block proliferation of a Y641
  mutant WSU-DLCL2 cells, but has little effect on non Y641 mutant OCI-LY19 cells. Cells were
  incubated in the presence of increasing concentrations of EZH2 inhibitor A or B for eleven days.
5 Vehicle treated (DMSO) cells were included as controls. Cell number and viability was
  determined using the Guava Viacount assay in a Guava EasyCyte Plus instrument. Cells were
  split and media and compound was replenished every 3-4 days.
           Figure 14 is a graph showing the presence of an EZH2 (Y641) mutation and/or high H3
  K27me3 and low H3-K27me2 levels predict sensitivity to EZH2 inhibitors. Cell lines were
                                                    8

  maintained in the presence of increasing concentrations of one EZH2 inhibitor up to 25 tiM.
  Viable cells counts were used to derive IC 90 values after 11 days of treatment. Results are plotted
  with cell lines segregated according to EZH2 mutational status (A), or segregated according to
  H3-K27me2 and H3-K27me3 levels (B). In both plots, the line shows the average IC90 values
  from the indicated cell line group.
          Figure 15 is a panel of graphs showing velocity vs. enzyme concentration measured for
  wild-type, A677G or A687V EZH2. Biotinylated peptides representing histone H3 residues 21
  44 containing un-, mono-, di- or trimethyl lysine 27 (H3K27meO through H3K27me3) were
  assayed at a fixed concentration with a dilution series of the indicated EZH2 enzyme.
  Timepoints were sampled over the course of 90 minutes and 3H-SAM incorporation at lysine 27
  of the H3 peptide was measured by capturing the peptide in a Flashplate and reading the counts
  per minute (CPM). Linear regression of the timecourse yielded enzyme velocity in CPM per
  minute (CPM/min) which was plotted as a function of enzyme concentration.
                                    DETAILED DESCRIPTION
          Chromatin structure is important in gene regulation and epigenetic inheritance. Post
  translational modifications of histones, such as methylation are involved in the establishment and
  maintenance of higher-order chromatin structure.
  EZH2 MUTANTS
9         EZH2 is a histone methyltransferase that is the catalytic subunit of the PRC2 complex
  which catalyzes the mono- through tri-methylation of lysine 27 on histone H3 (H3-K27).
          Point mutations of the EZH2 gene at a single amino acid residue (e.g., Tyr641, herein
  referred to as Y641) of EZH2 have been reported to be linked to subsets of human B-cell
  lymphoma. Morin et al. (2010) Nat Genet 42(2):181-5. In particular, Morin et al. reported that
5 somatic mutations of tyrosine 641 (Y641F, Y641H, Y641N, and Y641S) of EZH2 were
  associated with follicular lymphoma (FL) and the germinal center B cell-like (GCB) subtype of
  diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). The mutant allele is always found associated with a
  wild-type allele (heterozygous) in disease cells, and the mutations were reported to ablate the
  enzymatic activity of the PRC2 complex for methylating an unmodified peptide substrate.

           The present invention is based in part upon the surprising discovery that cells expressing
  an EZH2 mutant are more sensitive to EZH2 inhibitors of the instant invention than cells
  expressing wild type EZH2. Accordingly, an aspect of the present invention relates to methods
  for treating or alleviating a symptom of cancer or precancerous condition in a subject by
  administering to a subject expressing a mutant EZH2 a therapeutically effective amount of an
  EZH2 inhibitor. The mutant EZH2 of the present invention refers to a mutant EZH2 polypeptide
  or a nucleic acid sequence encoding a mutant EZH2 polypeptide. Preferably the mutant EZH2
  comprises one or more mutations in its substrate pocket domain as defined in SEQ ID NO: 6.
  For example, the mutation may be a substitution, a point mutation, a nonsense mutation, a
  misssense mutation, a deletion, or an insertion. Exemplary substitution amino acid mutation
  includes a substitution at amino acid position 677, 687, 674, 685, or 641 of SEQ ID NO: 1, such
  as, but is not limited to a substitution of glycine (G) for the wild type residue alanine (A) at
  amino acid position 677 of SEQ ID NO: 1 (A677G); a substitution of valine (V) for the wild type
  residue alanine (A) at amino acid position 687 of SEQ ID NO: 1 (A687V); a substitution of
  methionine (M) for the wild type residue valine (V) at amino acid position 674 of SEQ ID NO: 1

  (Y641S); or a substitution of cysteine (C) for the wild type residue tyrosine (Y) at amino acid
5 position 641 of SEQ ID NO: 1 (Y641C).

          The mutation of the present invention may be a frameshift at amino acid position 730,
  391, 461, 441, 235, 254, 564, 662, 715, 405, 685, 64, 73, 656, 718, 374, 592, 505, 730, or 363 of
  SEQ ID NO: 3, 5 or 21 or the corresponding nucleotide position of the nucleic acid sequence
  encoding SEQ ID NO: 3, 5, or 21. The mutation of the EZH2 may also be an insertion of a
  glutamic acid (E) between amino acid positions 148 and 149 of SEQ ID NO: 3, 5 or 21. Another
  example of EZH2 mutation is a deletion of glutamic acid (E) and leucine (L) at amino acid
  positions 148 and 149 of SEQ ID NO: 3, 5 or 21. The mutant EZH2 may further comprise a
  nonsense mutation at amino acid position 733, 25, 317, 62, 553, 328, 58, 207, 123, 63, 137, or 60
  of SEQ ID NO: 3, 5 or 21.
          It has also been unexpectedly discovered that the wild-type (WT) EZH2 enzyme displays
  greatest catalytic efficiency (kcat/K) for the zero- to mono-methylation reaction of H3-K27 and
5 lesser efficiency for subsequent (mono- to di- and di- to tri-methylation) reactions; whereas, in
  stark contrast, the disease-associated Y641 mutations display very limited ability to perform the
  first methylation reaction but have enhanced catalytic efficiency for the subsequent reactions
  relative to wild-type enzyme. These results imply that the malignant phenotype of disease
  exploits the combined activities of a H3-K27 mono-methylating enzyme (PRC2 containing WT
9 EZH2 or EZH1) together with PRC2 containing mutant EZH2 for augmented conversion of H3
  K27 to the tri-methylated form (H3-K27me3). Therefore, an aspect of the present invention
                                                     13

     WO 2013/138361                                                         PCT/US2013/030565
relates to inhibiting the activity of EZH2, including certain mutant forms of EZH2. In one
embodiment the present invention relates to inhibiting selectively the activity of certain mutant
forms of EZH2.
         While not intending to be bound by any one theory, it is hypothesized that the mutation
of EZH2 in its substrate pocket domain may facilitate multiple rounds of H3-K27 methylation by
impacting the H-bonding pattern and/or steric crowding in the active site of the enzyme
bisubstrate ternary complex, affecting the formation of a proper water channel for deprotonation
of the reacting lysine.

  Wherein X can be any amino acid except the corresponding wild type residue.
           The implications of the present results for human disease are made clear by the data
  summarized in Table 2 (see Example 5). Cells heterozygous for EZH2 would be expected to
  display a malignant phenotype due to the efficient formation of H3-K27me l by the WT enzyme
9 and the efficient, subsequent transition of this progenitor species to H3-K27me2, and, especially,
  H3-K27me3, by the mutant enzyme form(s).
           It has been reported that H3-K27mel formation is not exclusively dependent on WT
  EZH2 catalysis. Knockout studies of EZH2 and of another PRC2 subunit, EED, have
  demonstrated H3-K27me l formation can be catalyzed by PRC2 complexes containing either
5 EZH2 or the related protein EZH1 as the catalytic subunit. Shen, X. et al. (2008) Mol Cell
                                                    24

       WO 2013/138361                                                            PCT/US2013/030565
  32:491-502. Hence, catalytic coupling between the mutant EZH2 species and PRC2 complexes
  containing either WT-EZH2 or WT-EZH1 would suffice to augment H3-K27me2/3 formation,
  and thus produce the attendant malignant phenotype. The data therefore suggest that the
  malignant phenotype of follicular lymphoma (FL) and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma
  (DLBCL)of the germinal center B cell (GCB) subtype, associated with expression of mutant
  forms of EZH2, is the result of an overall gain of function with respect to formation of the
  trimethylated form of H3-K27. This interpretation of the data also helps to reconcile the
  existence of cancer-associated overexpression of EZH2 or PRC2 associated proteins (e.g.,
  PHF19/PCL3) and also loss-of-function genotypes for the histone H3-K27 demethylase UTX.
  Loss of UTX activity would be enzymatically equivalent to a gain of function for EZH2, in
  either situation resulting in greater steady state levels of tri-methylated H3-K27 in cancer cells
  (Figure 4).
           The mono-, di-, and tri- methylation states of histone H3-K27 are associated with
  different functions in transcriptional control. Histone H3-K27 monomethylation is associated
  with active transcription of genes that are poised for transcription. Cui et al. (2009) Cell Stem
  Cell 4:80-93; Barski (2007) Cell 129:823-37. In contrast, trimethylation of histone H3-K27 is
  associated with either transcriptionally repressed genes or genes that are poised for transcription
  when histone H3-K4 trimethylation is in cis. Cui et al. (supra); Kirmizis et al. (2007) Genes Dev
  18:1592-1605; Bernstein et al. (2006) Cell 125:315-26. Taken together, alterations in the PRC2
  complex activity reported in cancer, including the Y641 mutation of EZH2, are predicted to
  result in an increase in the trimethylated state of histone H3-K27 and thus to result in
  transcriptional repression.
           Another discovery of the present invention is that cells expressing a mutant EZH2
  comprising a mutation in the substrate pocket domain as defined in SEQ ID NO: 6 are, in
5 general, more sensitive to small molecule EZH2 inhibitors than cells expressing wild type (WT)
  EZH2. Specifically, cells expressing Y641 mutant EZH2 show reduced growing, dividing or
  proliferation, or even undergo apoptosis or necrosis after the treatment of EZH2 inhibitors. In
  contrast, cells expressing WT EZH2 are not responsive to the anti-proliferative effect of the
  EZH2 inhibitors (Figures 13 and 14). Particularly, cells expressing a substitution mutation at
9 amino acid position 677 of SEQ ID NO: 1 show greater sensitivity to EZH2 inhibitors than cells
  expressing other EZH2 mutants (Example 19).

        WO 2013/138361                                                          PCT/US2013/030565
           EZH2 and other protein methyltransferases have been suggested to be attractive targets
  for drug discovery. Copeland et al. (2009) Nat Rev Drug Discov 8:724-32; Copeland et al.
  (2010) Curr Opin Chem Biol 14(4):505-10; Pollock et al. (2010) Drug Discovery Today:
  Therapeutic Strategies 6(1):71-9. The present data also suggest an experimental strategy for
  development of FL and GCB lymphoma-specific drugs. As the differences in substrate
  recognition between the WT and disease-associated mutants derive from transition state
  interactions, small molecule inhibitors that selectively mimic the transition state of the mutant
  EZH2 over that of the WT enzyme should prove to be effective in blocking H3-K27 methylation
  in mutation-bearing cells. Inhibitors of this type would be expected to display a large therapeutic
  index, as target-mediated toxicity would be minimal for any cells bearing only the WT enzyme.
  Transition state mimicry has proved to be an effective strategy for drug design in many disease
  areas. See, for example, Copeland, R. A. Enzymes: A PracticalIntroduction to Structure,
  Mechanism and DataAnalysis. 2nd ed, (Wiley, 2000).
           The present results point to a previously unrecognized, surprising dependency on
  enzymatic coupling between enzymes that perform H3-K27 mono-methylation and certain
  mutant forms of EZH2 for pathogenesis in follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell
  lymphoma. While not intending to be bound by any one theory, it is believed the data constitute
  the first example of a human disease that is dependent on such coupling of catalytic activity
  between normal (WT) and disease-associated mutant (such as Y641) enzymes.
           An aspect of the present invention is a method for treating or alleviating a symptom of
  cancer or precancerous condition in a subject by administering to a subject expressing a mutant
  EZH2 comprising a mutation in the substrate pocket domain as defined in SEQ ID NO: 6 a
  therapeutically effective amount of an EZH2 inhibitor.
           Another aspect of the invention is a method for inhibiting in a subject conversion of H3
5 K27 to trimethylated H3-K27. The inhibition can involve inhibiting in a subject conversion of
  unmethylated H3-K27 to monomethylated H3-K27, conversion of monomethylated H3-K27 to
  dimethylated H3-K27, conversion of dimethylated H3-K27 to trimethylated H3-K27, or any
  combination thereof, including, for example, conversion of monomethylated H3-K27 to
  dimethylated H3-K27 and conversion of dimethylated H3-K27 to trimethylated H3-K27. As
9 used herein, unmethylated H3-K27 refers to histone H3 with no methyl group covalently linked

  to the amino group of lysine 27. As used herein, monomethylated H3-K27 refers to histone H3
  with a single methyl group covalently linked to the amino group of lysine 27. Monomethylated
  H3-K27 is also referred to herein as H3-K27mel. As used herein, dimethylated H3-K27 refers
  to histone H3 with two methyl groups covalently linked to the amino group of lysine 27.
  Dimethylated H3-K27 is also referred to herein as H3-K27me2. As used herein, trimethylated
  H3-K27 refers to histone H3 with three methyl groups covalently linked to the amino group of
  lysine 27. Trimethylated H3-K27 is also referred to herein as H3-K27me3.
          Histone H3 is a 136 amino acid long protein, the sequence of which is known. See, for
  example, GenBank Accession No. CAB02546, the content of which is incorporated herein by
  reference. As disclosed further herein, in addition to full-length histone H3, peptide fragments of
  histone H3 comprising the lysine residue corresponding to K27 of full-length histone H3 can be
  used as substrate for EZH2 (and likewise for mutant forms of EZH2) to assess conversion of H3
  K27ml to H3-K27m2 and conversion of H3-K27m2 to H3-K27m3. In one embodiment, such
  peptide fragment corresponds to amino acid residues 21-44 of histone H3. Such peptide
  fragment has the amino acid sequence LATKAARKSAPATGGVKKPHRYRP (SEQ ID NO: 19).
          The method of the present invention involves administering to a subject expressing a
  mutant EZH2 a therapeutically effective amount of an inhibitor of EZH2, wherein the inhibitor
  inhibits histone methyltransferase activity of EZH2, thereby inhibiting conversion of H3-K27 to
  trimethylated H3-K27 in the subject and thus treating or allievating a symptom of cancer or
  disorders associated with abnormal histon methylation levels in the subject.
          A subject expressing a mutant EZH2 of the present invention refers to a subject having a

  DETECTION OF EZH2 MUTANTS
          A mutant EZH2 polypeptide can be detected using any suitable method. For example, a
  mutant EZH2 polypeptide can be detected using an antibody that binds specifically to the mutant
  EZH2 polypeptide or to a peptide fragment that is characteristic of the mutant EZH2
  polypeptide. A peptide fragment that is characteristic of the mutant EZH2 polypeptide may
  include, for example, a SET domain as provided in SEQ ID NO: 7, except for substitution of one
  ore more residues in the substrate pocket domain as defined in SEQ ID NO: 6 by an amino acid
  residue other than the wild type residue. In another embodiment, a peptide fragment that is
  characteristic of the mutant EZH2 polypeptide may include, for example, a 10-113 amino acid
  fragment of the SET domain as provided in SEQ ID NO: 7, except for substitution of one ore
  more residues in the substrate pocket domain as defined in SEQ ID NO: 6 by an amino acid
  residue other than the wild type residue, provided that the fragment includes the amino acid
  residue corresponding to a mutation of EZH2.        An antibody is considered to bind specifically to
  the mutant EZH2 polypeptide or to a peptide fragment that is characteristic of the mutant EZH2
  polypeptide if it binds to that mutant EZH2 polypeptide or peptide fragment thereof but not to
  the corresponding wild-type EZH2 polypeptide or peptide fragment thereof. In one embodiment,
  such antibody is considered to bind specifically to the mutant EZH2 polypeptide or to a peptide
5 fragment that is characteristic of the mutant EZH2 polypeptide if it binds to that mutant EZH2
  polypeptide or peptide fragment thereof with an affinity that is at least ca. 100-fold greater than
  for the corresponding wild-type EZH2 polypeptide or peptide fragment thereof. In one
  embodiment, such antibody is considered to bind specifically to the mutant EZH2 polypeptide or
  to a peptide fragment that is characteristic of the mutant EZH2 polypeptide if it binds to that
9 mutant EZH2 polypeptide or peptide fragment thereof with an affinity that is at least ca. 1000
                                                    29

        WO 2013/138361                                                        PCT/US2013/030565
  fold greater than for the corresponding wild-type EZH2 polypeptide or peptide fragment thereof.
  The antibody can be used, for example, in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or
  Western blot assay. The antibody may be monoclonal, polyclonal, chimeric, or an antibody
  fragment. The step of detecting the reaction product may be carried out with any suitable
  immunoassay.
           In one embodiment the antibody is a monoclonal antibody. A monoclonal antibody can
  be prepared according to conventional methods well known in the art. See, for example, Kdhler
  and Milstein (1975) Nature 256 (5517):495-7.
           As another example, a mutant EZH2 polypeptide can be detected using mass
  spectrometry (MS), e.g., electrospray ionization coupled with time-of-flight (ESI-TOF) or
  matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization coupled with time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF). Such
  methods are well known in the art. The analysis will involve identification of one or more
  peptide fragments comprising the mutation of interest, for example, a peptide 12 to 24 amino
  acids long comprising a sequence spanning the amino acid corresponding to a mutation in wild
  type EZH2.
           A nucleic acid sequence encoding a mutant EZH2 polypeptide or a peptide fragment that
  is characteristic of the mutant EZH2 polypeptide can be detected using any suitable method. For
  example, a nucleic acid sequence encoding a mutant EZH2 polypeptide can be detected using
  whole-genome resequencing or target region resequencing (the latter also known as targeted
  resequencing) using suitably selected sources of DNA and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
  primers in accordance with methods well known in the art. See, for example, Bentley (2006)
  Curr Opin Genet Dev. 16:545-52, and Li et al. (2009) Genome Res 19:1124-32. The method
  typically and generally entails the steps of genomic DNA purification, PCR amplification to
  amplify the region of interest, cycle sequencing, sequencing reaction cleanup, capillary
5 electrophoresis, and data analysis. High quality PCR primers to cover region of interest are
  designed using in silico primer design tools. Cycle sequencing is a simple method in which
  successive rounds of denaturation, annealing, and extension in a thermal cycler result in linear
  amplification of extension products. The products are typically terminated with a fluorescent tag
  that identifies the terminal nucleotide base as G, A, T, or C. Unincorporated dye terminators and
9 salts that may compete for capillary eletrophoretic injection are removed by washing. During
  capillary electrophoresis, the products of the cycle sequencing reaction migrate through
                                                   30

       WO 2013/138361                                                           PCT/US2013/030565
  capillaries filled with polymer. The negatively charged DNA fragments are separated by size as
  they move through the capillaries toward the positive electrode. After electrophoresis, data
  collection software creates a sample file of the raw data. Using downstream software
  applications, further data analysis is performed to translate the collected color data images into
  the corresponding nucleotide bases. Alternatively or in addition, the method may include the use
  of microarray-based targeted region genomic DNA capture and/or sequencing. Kits, reagents,
  and methods for selecting appropriate PCR primers and performing resequencing are
  commercially available, for example, from Applied Biosystems, Agilent, and NimbleGen (Roche
  Diagnostics GmbH). Methods such as these have been used to detect JAK2 and
  myeloproliferative leukemia gene (MPL) mutations and to diagnose polycythemia vera, essential
  thrombocythemia, and idiopathic myelofibrosis. For use in the instant invention, PCR primers
  may be selected so as to amplify, for example, at least a relevant portion of SEQ ID NO: 8
  (above).
           Alternatively or in addition, a nucleic acid sequence encoding a mutant EZH2
  polypeptide may be detected using a Southern blot in accordance with methods well known in
  the art. In one embodiment a DNA sequence encoding a mutant EZH2 polypeptide is detected
  using nucleic acid hybridization performed under highly stringent conditions. A nucleic acid
  probe is selected such that its sequence is complementary to a target nucleic acid sequence that
  includes a codon for the mutant amino acid corresponding to a mutation of wild-type EZH2.
  Such mutation includes any mutation of EZH2, preferably one or more mutations in the substrate
  pocket domain as defined in SEQ ID NO: 6 of EZH2, such as, but are not limited to a
  substitution of glycine (G) for the wild type residue alanine (A) at amino acid position 677 of
  SEQ ID NO: 1 (A677G); a substitution of valine (V) for the wild type residue alanine (A) at
  amino acid position 687 of SEQ ID NO: 1 (A687V); a substitution of methionine (M) for the
5 wild type residue valine (V) at amino acid position 674 of SEQ ID NO: 1 (V674M); a
  substitution of histidine (H) for the wild type residue arginine (R) at amino acid position 685 of
  SEQ ID NO: 1 (R685H); a substitution of cysteine (C) for the wild type residue arginine (R) at
  amino acid position 685 of SEQ ID NO: 1 (R685C); a substitution of phenylalanine (F) for the
  wild type residue tyrosine (Y) at amino acid position 641 of SEQ ID NO: 1 (Y641F); a
9 substitution of histidine (H) for the wild type residue tyrosine (Y) at amino acid position 641 of
  SEQ ID NO: 1 (Y641H); a substitution of asparagine (N) for the wild type residue tyrosine (Y)

         A sequence-specific probe is combined with a sample to be tested under highly stringent
conditions. The term "highly stringent conditions" as used herein refers to parameters with
which the art is familiar. Nucleic acid hybridization parameters may be found in references that
compile such methods, e.g., J. Sambrook, et al., eds., Molecular Cloning: A LaboratoryManual,
Second Edition, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York, 1989, or
F. M. Ausubel, et al., eds., CurrentProtocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley & Sons, Inc.,
New York. More specifically, highly stringent conditions, as used herein, refers, for example, to
hybridization at 650 C in hybridization buffer (3.5 x SSC, 0.02% Ficoll, 0.02% polyvinyl
pyrrolidone, 0.02% bovine serum albumin (BSA), 2.5 mM NaH 2 PO 4 (pH 7), 0.5% SDS, 2 mM
EDTA). SSC is 0.15 M sodium chloride/0.015 M sodium citrate, pH 7; SDS is sodium dodecyl
sulphate; and EDTA is ethylenediaminetetracetic acid. After hybridization, the membrane upon
which the DNA is transferred is washed, for example, in 2 x SSC at room temperature and then
at 0.1-0.5 x SSC/0.1 x SDS at temperatures up to 680 C.
         There are other conditions, reagents, and so forth that can be used, which result in a
similar degree of stringency. The skilled artisan will be familiar with such conditions, and thus
they are not given here. It will be understood, however, that the skilled artisan will be able to
manipulate the conditions in a manner to permit the clear identification of EZH2-associated
nucleic acids of the invention, including, in particular, nucleic acids encoding mutants of EZH2
(e.g., by using lower stringency conditions). The skilled artisan also is familiar with the
methodology for screening cells and libraries for expression of such molecules, which then are
routinely isolated, followed by isolation of the pertinent nucleic acid molecule and sequencing.
         The subject is administered a therapeutically effective amount of an inhibitor of EZH2.
As used herein, an inhibitor of EZH2 refers, generally, to a small molecule, i.e., a molecule of
molecular weight less than about 1.5 kilodaltons (kDa), which is capable of interfering with the
histone methyltransferase enzymatic activity of EZH2.
                                                  32

       WO 2013/138361                                                           PCT/US2013/030565
          In one embodiment the inhibitor of EZH2 inhibits histone methyltransferase activity of
  wild-type EZH2. In one embodiment the inhibitor of EZH2 inhibits histone methyltransferase
  activity of the mutant EZH2. In one embodiment the inhibitor of EZH2 inhibits histone
  methyltransferase activity of wild-type EZH2 and histone methyltransferase activity of the
  mutant EZH2. In one embodiment the inhibitor of EZH2 selectively inhibits histone
  methyltransferase activity of the mutant EZH2.
          As disclosed herein, certain mutants of EZH2 (such as Y641) are relatively poor catalysts
  for conversion of unmethylated H3-K27 to H3-K27mel and yet unexpectedly effective catalysts
  for conversion of H3-K27me2 to H3-K27me3. Certain mutants of EZH2 (such as A687) prefer
  monomethyl H3-K27 substrate. In contrast, certain mutants of EZH2 (such as A677) show equal
  preference among unmethylated, monomethylated and dimethylated H3-K27. Conversely, wild
  type EZH2 is a relatively effective catalyst for conversion of unmethylated H3-K27 to H3
  K27mel and yet unexpectedly ineffective catalyst for conversion of H3-K27me2 to H3-K27me3.
  This is important because mono-, di- and tri-methylated states of H3-K27 exhibit different
  functions in transcriptional control. For example, H3-K27mel is associated with active
  transcription of genes that are poised for transcription, while H3-K27me3 is associated with
  transcriptionally repressed genes or genes that are poised for transcription when H3-K4
  trimethylation is in cis. Thus, selective inhibition of histone methyltransferase activity of the
  mutant of EZH2 affects selective inhibition of production of the different methylated forms of
  H3-K27, thereby modifying transcription associated with H3-K27 methylation levels.
          An inhibitor of EZH2 "selectively inhibits" histone methyltransferase activity of the
  mutant EZH2 when it inhibits histone methyltransferase activity of the mutant EZH2 more
  effectively than it inhibits histone methyltransferase activity of wild-type EZH2. For example, in
  one embodiment the selective inhibitor has an IC50 for the mutant EZH2 that is at least 40
5 percent lower than the IC50 for wild-type EZH2. In one embodiment the selective inhibitor has
  an IC50 for the mutant EZH2 that is at least 50 percent lower than the IC50 for wild-type EZH2.
  In one embodiment the selective inhibitor has an IC50 for the mutant EZH2 that is at least 60
  percent lower than the IC50 for wild-type EZH2. In one embodiment the selective inhibitor has
  an IC50 for the mutant EZH2 that is at least 70 percent lower than the IC50 for wild-type EZH2.
9 In one embodiment the selective inhibitor has an IC50 for the mutant EZH2 that is at least 80
                                                     33

        WO 2013/138361                                                          PCT/US2013/030565
  percent lower than the IC50 for wild-type EZH2. In one embodiment the selective inhibitor has
  an IC50 for the mutant EZH2 that is at least 90 percent lower than the IC50 for wild-type EZH2.
          In one embodiment, the selective inhibitor of a mutant EZH2 exerts essentially no
  inhibitory effect on wild-type EZH2.
          The inhibitor inhibits conversion of H3-K27me2 to H3-K27me3. In one embodiment the
  inhibitor is said to inhibit trimethylation of H3-K27. Since conversion of H3-K27mel to H3
  K27me2 precedes conversion of H3-K27me2 to H3-K27me3, an inhibitor of conversion of H3
  K27mel to H3-K27me2 naturally also inhibits conversion of H3-K27me2 to H3-K27me3, i.e., it
  inhibits trimethylation of H3-K27. It is also possible to inhibit conversion of H3-K27me2 to H3
  K27me3 without inhibition of conversion of H3-K27mel to H3-K27me2. Inhibition of this type
  would also result in inhibition of trimethylation of H3-K27, albeit without inhibition of
  dimethylation of H3-K27.
          In one embodiment the inhibitor inhibits conversion of H3-K27mel to H3-K27me2 and
  the conversion of H3-K27me2 to H3-K27me3. Such inhibitor may directly inhibit the
  conversion of H3-K27mel to H3-K27me2 alone. Alternatively, such inhibitor may directly
  inhibit both the conversion of H3-K27mel to H3-K27me2 and the conversion of H3-K27me2 to
  H3-K27me3.
          The inhibitor inhibits histone methylase activity. Inhibition of histone methylase activity
  can be detected using any suitable method. The inhibition can be measured, for example, either
  in terms of rate of histone methylase activity or as product of histone methylase activity.
  Methods suitable for either of these readouts are included in the Examples below.
          The inhibition is a measurable inhibition compared to a suitable negative control. In one
  embodiment, inhibition is at least 10 percent inhibition compared to a suitable negative control.
  That is, the rate of enzymatic activity or the amount of product with the inhibitor is less than or
5 equal to 90 percent of the corresponding rate or amount made without the inhibitor. In various
  other embodiments, inhibition is at least 20, 25, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 75, 80, 90, or 95 percent
  inhibition compared to a suitable negative control. In one embodiment, inhibition is at least 99
  percent inhibition compared to a suitable negative control. That is, the rate of enzymatic activity
  or the amount of product with the inhibitor is less than or equal to 1 percent of the corresponding
9 rate or amount made without the inhibitor.

        In certain embodiments the invention comprises the step of performing an assay to detect
a mutant of EZH2 in a sample from a subject. Assays of this type are described above. As used
herein, a "sample from a subject" refers to any suitable sample containing cells or components of
cells obtained or derived from a subject. In one embodiment the sample includes cells suspected
to express mutant EZH2, e.g., cancer cells. In one embodiment the sample is a blood sample. In
                                                35

      WO 2013/138361                                                          PCT/US2013/030565
one embodiment the sample is a biopsy sample obtained from, for example, a lymphatic tissue
(e.g., lymph node) or bone marrow. In one embodiment the sample is a biopsy sample obtained
from a tissue other than or in addition to a lymphatic tissue (e.g., lymph node) or bone marrow.
For example, in one embodiment the sample is a biopsy from a cancer, e.g., a tumor composed of
cancer cells. Cells in the sample can be isolated from other components of the sample. For
example, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) can be isolated as a buffy coat from a
blood sample that has been centrifuged in accordance with methods familiar to those of skill in
the art.
         When the result of the assay on a sample from a subject indicates that a mutant EZH2 is
present in the sample, the subject is said to express mutant EZH2. Indeed, in one embodiment,
when the result of the assay on a sample from a subject indicates that a mutant EZH2 is present
in the sample, the subject is identified as a candidate for treatment with an inhibitor of EZH2,
wherein the inhibitor selectively inhibits histone methyltransferase activity of the mutant EZH2.
         When the result of the assay on a sample from a cancer indicates that a mutant EZH2 is
present in the cancer, the cancer is said to express the mutant EZH2.
         Similarly, when the result of the assay on a sample comprising cancer cells from a subject
having a cancer indicates that a mutant EZH2 is present in the sample, the subject is said to
express the mutant EZH2.
         Detection of dimethylated H3-K27 or trimethlated H3-K27 can be accomplished using
any suitable method in the art. In one embodiment, the methylation level is detected using
antibodies specific for dimethylated H3-K27 or trimethlated H3-K27. For example, the isolated
tissue is formalin fixed and embedded in paraffin blocks for long term preservation. The blocks
can be used to prepare slides for immunohistochemical staining or fluorescent staining with
antibodies against methylated H3-K27. Alternatively, whole cell lysates or histone extracts can
be prepared from the isolated tissue sample and subsequently used for immunohistochemical
staining, western blot analysis or fluorescent staining. In another embodiment the methylation
level is detected using a polypeptide or an aptamer specific for dimethylated H3-K27 or
trimethlated H3-K27. In another embodiment, the methylation level is detected using mass
spectrometry (MS).

          A control dimethylated H3-K27 or a control trimethlated H3-K27 can be established from
  a control sample, e.g., an adjacent non-tumor tissue isolated from the subject or a healthy tissue
  from a healthy subject. Alternatively, the control methylation level of H3-K27me2 or H3
  K27me3 can be established by a pathologist with known methods in the art.
  SCREENING METHODS
          An aspect of the invention is a method for identifying a test compound as an inhibitor of
  a mutant EZH2. In one embodiment the method includes combining an isolated mutant EZH2
  with a histone substrate, a methyl group donor (such as S-adenosyl methionine (SAM)), and a
  test compound, wherein the histone substrate comprises a form of H3-K27 selected from the
  group consisting of unmethylated H3-K27, monomethylated H3-K27, dimethylated H3-K27, and
  any combination thereof; and performing an assay to detect methylation of H3-K27 in the
  histone substrate, thereby identifying the test compound as an inhibitor of the mutant EZH2
  when methylation of H3-K27 in the presence of the test compound is less than methylation of
  H3-K27 in the absence of the test compound. The assay to detect methylation of H3-K27 can be
  selected to measure the rate of methylation, the extent of methylation, or both the rate and extent
  of methylation.
          The mutant EZH2 is isolated as a PRC2 complex or functional equivalent thereof. As
  used herein, the term "isolated" means substantially separated from other components with
  which the complex may be found as it occurs in nature. A compound can be isolated without
  necessarily being purified. In one embodiment the mutant of EZH2 is isolated as a complex of a
  mutant EZH2 together with EED and SUZ12. In another embodiment the mutant of EZH2 is
  isolated as a complex of a mutant EZH2 together with EED, SUZ12, and RbAp48. Under
  appropriate conditions, a PRC2 complex or functional equivalent thereof exhibits histone
  methyltransferase activity for H3-K27. In one embodiment the complex is composed of
5 recombinantly expressed component polypeptides, e.g., EZH2, EED, SUZ12, with or without
  RbAp48.
          The isolated mutant EZH2 is combined with a histone substrate. A histone substrate
  includes any suitable source of histone polypeptides or fragments thereof that can serve as
  substrate for EZH2. In one embodiment the histone substrate includes histones isolated from a

  methods are well known to persons skilled in the art and need not be further specified here. See,
  for example, Fang et al. (2004) Methods Enzymol 377:213-26. In accordance with the Examples
  below, in one embodiment the histone substrate is provided as nucleosomes. In accordance with
  the Examples below, in one embodiment the histone substrate is provided as avian (chicken)
  erythrocyte nucleosomes.
          Histone substrate so provided may include an admixture of states of histone modification,
  including various states of H3-K27 methylation as judged by Western blotting with H3-K27
  methylation state-specific antibodies. In one embodiment the histone substrate may be provided
  as purified full-length histone H3. Such purified full-length histone H3 may be provided as a
  homogeneous preparation in respect of states of H3-K27 methylation, or as an admixture of
  various states of H3-K27 methylation. Homogeneous preparations of isolated histone H3 in
  respect of states of H3-K27 methylation may be prepared in part by passage over an
  immunoaffinity column loaded with suitable H3-K27 methylation state-specific antibodies or by
  immunoprecipitation using magnetic beads coated with suitable H3-K27 methylation state
  specific antibodies. Alternatively or in addition, the methylation state of H3-K27 can be
  characterized as part of performing the assay. For example, the starting material histone
  substrate might be characterized as containing 50 percent unmethylated H3-K27, 40 percent
  monomethylated H3-K27, 10 percent dimethylated H3-K27, and 0 percent trimethylated H3
  K27.
          In one embodiment the histone substrate includes a peptide library or a suitable peptide
  comprising one or more amino acid sequences related to histone H3, including, in particular, a
  sequence that encompasses H3-K27. For example, in one embodiment, the histone substrate is a
  peptide fragment that corresponds to amino acid residues 21-44 of histone H3. Such peptide
  fragment has the amino acid sequence LATKAARKSAPATGGVKKPHRYRP (SEQ ID NO: 19).
5 The peptide library or peptide can be prepared by peptide synthesis according to techniques well
  known in the art and optionally modified so as to incorporate any desired degree of methylation
  of lysine corresponding to H3-K27. As described in the Examples below, such peptides can also
  be modified to incorporate a label, such as biotin, useful in performing downstream assays. In
  one embodiment the label is appended to the amino (N)-terminus of the peptide(s). In one
9 embodiment the label is appended to the carboxy (C)-terminus of the peptide(s).
                                                   38

        WO 2013/138361                                                       PCT/US2013/030565
           H3-K27 methylation-specific antibodies are available from a variety of commercial
  sources, including, for example, Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA) and Active Motif
  (Carlsbad, CA).
           The isolated mutant EZH2 is combined with a test compound. As used herein, a "test
  compound" refers to a small organic molecule having a molecular weight of less than about 1.5
  kDa. In one embodiment a test compound is a known compound. In one embodiment a test
  compound is a novel compound. In one embodiment, a test compound can be provided as part of
  a library of such compounds, wherein the library includes, for example, tens, hundreds,
  thousands, or even more compounds. A library of compounds may advantageously be screened
  in a high throughput screening assay, for example, using arrays of test compounds and robotic
  manipulation in accordance with general techniques well known in the art.
           In certain embodiments a test compound is a compound that is a derivative of SAH or a
  derivative of Compound 75.
           Detection of methylation of H3-K27 can be accomplished using any suitable method. In
  one embodiment, the source of donor methyl groups includes methyl groups that are labeled with
  a detectable label. The detectable label in one embodiment is an isotopic label, e.g., tritium.
  Other types of labels may include, for example, fluorescent labels.
           Detection of formation of trimethylated H3-K27 can be accomplished using any suitable
  method. For example, detection of formation of trimethylated H3-K27 can be accomplished
  using an assay to detect incorporation of labeled methyl groups, such as described above,
  optionally combined with a chromatographic or other method to separate labeled products by
  size, e.g., polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), capillary electrophoresis (CE), or high
  pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). Alternatively or in addition, detection of formation of
  trimethylated H3-K27 can be accomplished using antibodies that are specific for trimethylated
5 H3-K27.
           Detection of conversion of monomethylated H3-K27 to dimethylated H3-K27 can be
  accomplished using any suitable method. In one embodiment the conversion is measured using
  antibodies specific for monomethylated H3-K27 and dimethylated H3-K27. For example,
  starting amounts or concentrations of monomethylated H3-K27 and dimethylated H3-K27 may
9 be determined using appropriate antibodies specific for monomethylated H3-K27 and
                                                   39

  dimethylated H3-K27. Following the combination of enzyme, substrate, methyl group donor,
  and test compound, resulting amounts or concentrations of monomethylated H3-K27 and
  dimethylated H3-K27 may then be determined using appropriate antibodies specific for
  monomethylated H3-K27 and dimethylated H3-K27. The beginning and resulting amounts or
  concentrations of monomethylated H3-K27 and dimethylated H3-K27can then be compared.
  Alternatively or in addition, beginning and resulting amounts or concentrations of
  monomethylated H3-K27 and dimethylated H3-K27 can then be compared to corresponding
  amounts of concentrations from a negative control. A negative control reaction, in which no test
  agent is included in the assay, can be run in parallel or as a historical control. Results of such
  control reaction can optionally be subtracted from corresponding results of the experimental
  reaction prior to or in conjunction with making the comparison mentioned above.
           Because the dimethylated form of H3-K27 may be further methylated in the same assay,
  a reduction in the amount or concentration of monomethylated H3-K27 may not appear to
  correspond directly to an increase in dimethylated H3-K27. In this instance, it may be presumed,
  however, that a reduction in the amount or concentration of monomethylated H3-K27 is, by
  itself, reflective of conversion of monomethylated H3-K27 to dimethylated H3-K27.
           Detection of conversion of dimethylated H3-K27 to trimethylated H3-K27 can be
  accomplished using any suitable method. In one embodiment the conversion is measured using
  antibodies specific for dimethylated H3-K27 and trimethylated H3-K27. For example, starting
  amounts or concentrations of dimethylated H3-K27 and trimethylated H3-K27 may be
  determined using appropriate antibodies specific for dimethylated H3-K27 and trimethylated H3
  K27. Following the combination of enzyme, substrate, and test compound, resulting amounts or
  concentrations of dimethylated H3-K27 and trimethylated H3-K27 may then be determined
  using appropriate antibodies specific for dimethylated H3-K27 and trimethylated H3-K27. The
5 beginning and resulting amounts or concentrations of dimethylated H3-K27 and trimethylated
  H3-K27can then be compared. Alternatively or in addition, beginning and resulting amounts or
  concentrations of dimethylated H3-K27 and trimethylated H3-K27 can then be compared to
  corresponding amounts of concentrations from a negative control. A negative control reaction,
  in which no test agent is included in the assay, can be run in parallel or as a historical control.
9 Results of such control reaction can optionally be subtracted from corresponding results of the
  experimental reaction prior to or in conjunction with making the comparison mentioned above.

           A test agent is identified as an inhibitor of the mutant EZH2 when methylation of H3
  K27 with the test compound is less than methylation of H3-K27 without the test compound. In
  one embodiment, a test agent is identified as an inhibitor of the mutant EZH2 when formation of
  trimethylated H3-K27 in the presence of the test compound is less than formation of
  trimethylated H3-K27 in the absence of the test compound.
           An aspect of the invention is a method for identifying a selective inhibitor of a mutant
  EZH2. In one embodiment the method includes combining an isolated mutant EZH2 with a
  histone substrate, a methyl group donor (e.g., SAM), and a test compound, wherein the histone
  substrate comprises a form of H3-K27 selected from the group consisting of monomethylated
  H3-K27, dimethylated H3-K27, and a combination of monomethylated H3-K27 and
  dimethylated H3-K27, thereby forming a test mixture; combining an isolated wild-type EZH2
  with a histone substrate, a methyl group donor (e.g., SAM), and a test compound, wherein the
  histone substrate comprises a form of H3-K27 selected from the group consisting of
  monomethylated H3-K27, dimethylated H3-K27, and a combination of monomethylated H3-K27
  and dimethylated H3-K27, thereby forming a control mixture; performing an assay to detect
  trimethylation of the histone substrate in each of the test mixture and the control mixture;
  calculating the ratio of (a) trimethylation with the mutant EZH2 and the test compound (M+) to
  (b) trimethylation with the mutant EZH2 without the test compound (M-); calculating the ratio of
  (c) trimethylation with wild-type EZH2 and the test compound (WT+) to (d) trimethylation with
  wild-type EZH2 without the test compound (WT-); comparing the ratio (a)/(b) with the ratio
  (c)/(d); and identifying the test compound as a selective inhibitor of the mutant EZH2 when the
  ratio (a)/(b) is less than the ratio (c)/(d). In one embodiment the method further includes taking
  into account a negative control without test compound for either or both of the test mixture and
  the control mixture.
5          The present invention also provides a previously unrecognized, surprising correlation of a
  patient's responsiveness to an EZH2 inhibitor. Accordingly, an aspect of the invention is a
  method for determining a responsiveness to an EZH2 inhibitor in a subject having a cancer or a
  precancerous condition. The method generally involves in detecting a mutation in the EZH2
  substrate pocket domain as defined in SEQ ID NO: 6. For example, the mutation may be a
9 substitution, a point mutation, a nonsense mutation, a misssense mutation, a deletion, or an
  insertion described above. Preferred substitution amino acid mutation includes a substitution at
                                                       41

  amino acid position 677, 687, 674, 685, or 641 of SEQ ID NO: 1, such as, but is not limited to a

  type residue tyrosine (Y) at amino acid position 641 of SEQ ID NO: 1 (Y641S); or a substitution
  of cysteine (C) for the wild type residue tyrosine (Y) at amino acid position 641 of SEQ ID NO:
  1 (Y641C).
          In a preferred embodiment, the subject has cancer or a cancerous condition. For
  example, the cancer is lymphoma, leukemia or melanoma. Preferably, the lymphoma is non
  Hodgkin lymphoma, follicular lymphoma or diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Alternatively, the
  leukemia is chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). The precancerous condition is
  myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS, formerly known as preleukemia).

  PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS
           One or more EZH2 antagonists can be administered alone to a human patient or in
  pharmaceutical compositions where they are mixed with suitable carriers or excipient(s) at doses
  to treat or ameliorate a disease or condition as described herein. Mixtures of these EZH2
  antagonists can also be administered to the patient as a simple mixture or in suitable formulated
  pharmaceutical compositions. For example, one aspect of the invention relates to pharmaceutical
  composition comprising a therapeutically effective dose of an EZH2 antagonist, or a
  pharmaceutically acceptable salt, hydrate, enantiomer or stereoisomer thereof; and a
  pharmaceutically acceptable diluent or carrier.
           Techniques for formulation and administration of EZH2 antagonists may be found in
  references well known to one of ordinary skill in the art, such as Remington's "The Science and
  Practice of Pharmacy," 21st ed., Lippincott Williams & Wilkins 2005.
           Suitable routes of administration may, for example, include oral, rectal, or intestinal
  administration; parenteral delivery, including intravenous, intramuscular, intraperitoneal,
  subcutaneous, or intramedullary injections, as well as intrathecal, direct intraventricular, or
  intraocular injections; topical delivery, including eyedrop and transdermal; and intranasal and
5 other transmucosal delivery.
           Alternatively, one may administer an EZH2 antagonist in a local rather than a systemic
  manner, for example, via injection of the EZH2 antagonist directly into an edematous site, often
  in a depot or sustained release formulation.
           In one embodiment, an EZH2 antagonist is administered by direct injection into a tumor
9 or lymph node.

        WO 2013/138361                                                           PCT/US2013/030565
           Furthermore, one may administer an EZH2 antagonist in a targeted drug delivery system,
  for example, in a liposome coated with cancer cell-specific antibody.
           The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may be manufactured, e.g., by
  conventional mixing, dissolving, granulating, dragee-making, levigating, emulsifying,
  encapsulating, entrapping or lyophilizing processes.
           Pharmaceutical compositions for use in accordance with the present invention thus may
  be formulated in a conventional manner using one or more physiologically acceptable carriers
  comprising excipients and auxiliaries which facilitate processing of the active EZH2 antagonists
  into preparations which can be used pharmaceutically. Proper formulation is dependent upon the
  route of administration chosen.
           For injection, the agents of the invention may be formulated in aqueous solutions,
  preferably in physiologically compatible buffers such as Hanks' solution, Ringer's solution, or
  physiological saline buffer. For transmucosal administration, penetrants are used in the
  formulation appropriate to the barrier to be permeated. Such penetrants are generally known in
  the art.
           For oral administration, the EZH2 antagonists can be formulated readily by combining
  the active EZH2 antagonists with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers well known in the art.
  Such carriers enable the EZH2 antagonists of the invention to be formulated as tablets, pills,
  dragees, capsules, liquids, gels, syrups, slurries, suspensions and the like, for oral ingestion by a
  patient to be treated. Pharmaceutical preparations for oral use can be obtained by combining the
  active EZH2 antagonist with a solid excipient, optionally grinding a resulting mixture, and
  processing the mixture of granules, after adding suitable auxiliaries, if desired, to obtain tablets
  or dragee cores. Suitable excipients include fillers such as sugars, including lactose, sucrose,
  mannitol, or sorbitol; cellulose preparations such as, for example, maize starch, wheat starch, rice
5 starch, potato starch, gelatin, gum tragacanth, methyl cellulose, hydroxypropylmethyl-cellulose,
  sodium carboxymethylcellulose, and/or polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). If desired, disintegrating
  agents may be added, such as the cross-linked polyvinyl pyrrolidone, agar, or alginic acid or a
  salt thereof such as sodium alginate.
           Dragee cores are provided with suitable coatings. For this purpose, concentrated sugar
9 solutions may be used, which may optionally contain gum arabic, talc, polyvinyl pyrrolidone,
                                                     44

       WO 2013/138361                                                             PCT/US2013/030565
  carbopol gel, polyethylene glycol, and/or titanium dioxide, lacquer solutions, and suitable
  organic solvents or solvent mixtures. Dyestuffs or pigments may be added to the tablets or
  dragee coatings for identification or to characterize different combinations of active EZH2
  antagonist doses.
          Pharmaceutical preparations which can be used orally include push-fit capsules made of
  gelatin, as well as soft, sealed capsules made of gelatin and a plasticizer, such as glycerol or
  sorbitol. The push-fit capsules can contain the active ingredients in admixture with filler such as
  lactose, binders such as starches, and/or lubricants such as talc or magnesium stearate and,
  optionally, stabilizers. In soft capsules, the active EZH2 antagonists may be dissolved or
  suspended in suitable liquids, such as fatty oils, liquid paraffin, or liquid polyethylene glycols.
  In addition, stabilizers may be added.
          For buccal administration, the compositions may take the form of tablets or lozenges
  formulated in conventional manner.
          For administration by inhalation, the EZH2 antagonists for use according to the present
  invention are conveniently delivered in the form of an aerosol spray presentation from
  pressurized packs or a nebuliser, with the use of a suitable propellant, e.g.,
  dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, dichlorotetrafluoroethane, carbon dioxide or
  other suitable gas. In the case of pressurized aerosol the dosage unit may be determined by
  providing a valve to deliver a metered amount. Capsules and cartridges of e.g., gelatin for use in
  an inhaler or insufflator may be formulated containing a powder mix of the EZH2 antagonist and
  a suitable powder base such as lactose or starch.
          The EZH2 antagonists can be formulated for parenteral administration by injection, e.g.,
  bolus injection or continuous infusion. Formulations for injection may be presented in unit
  dosage form, e.g., in ampoules or in multi-dose containers, with an added preservative. The
5 compositions may take such forms as suspensions, solutions or emulsions in oily or aqueous
  vehicles, and may contain formulatory agents such as suspending, stabilizing and/or dispersing
  agents.
          Pharmaceutical formulations for parenteral administration include aqueous solutions of
  the active EZH2 antagonists in water-soluble form. Additionally, suspensions of the active
9 EZH2 antagonists may be prepared as appropriate oily injection suspensions. Suitable lipophilic

  solvents or vehicles include fatty oils such as sesame oil, or synthetic fatty acid esters, such as
  ethyl oleate or triglycerides, or liposomes. Aqueous injection suspensions may contain
  substances which increase the viscosity of the suspension, such as sodium carboxymethyl
  cellulose, sorbitol, or dextran. Optionally, the suspension may also contain suitable stabilizers or
  agents which increase the solubility of the EZH2 antagonists to allow for the preparation of
  highly concentrated solutions.
           Alternatively, the active ingredient may be in powder form for reconstitution before use
  with a suitable vehicle, e.g., sterile pyrogen-free water.
           The EZH2 antagonists may also be formulated in rectal compositions such as
  suppositories or retention enemas, e.g., containing conventional suppository bases, such as cocoa
  butter or other glycerides.
           In addition to the formulations described previously, the EZH2 antagonists may also be
  formulated as a depot preparation. Such long acting formulations may be administered by
  implantation (for example, subcutaneously or intramuscularly or by intramuscular injection).
  Thus, for example, the EZH2 antagonists may be formulated with suitable polymeric or
  hydrophobic materials (for example as an emulsion in an acceptable oil) or ion exchange resins,
  or as sparingly soluble derivatives (for example, as a sparingly soluble salt).
           Alternatively, other delivery systems for hydrophobic pharmaceutical EZH2 antagonists
  may be employed. Liposomes and emulsions are examples of delivery vehicles or carriers for
  hydrophobic drugs. Certain organic solvents such as dimethysulfoxide also may be employed.
  Additionally, the EZH2 antagonists may be delivered using a sustained-release system, such as
  semi-permeable matrices of solid hydrophobic polymers containing the therapeutic agent.
  Various sustained-release materials have been established and are well known by those skilled in
  the art. Sustained-release capsules may, depending on their chemical nature, release the EZH2
5 antagonists for a few weeks up to over 100 days. Depending on the chemical nature and the
  biological stability of the therapeutic reagent, additional strategies for protein stabilization may
  be employed.
           The pharmaceutical compositions may also comprise suitable solid or gel phase carriers
  or excipients. Examples of such carriers or excipients include but are not limited to calcium
9 carbonate, calcium phosphate, various sugars, starches, cellulose derivatives, gelatin, and
                                                     46

  METHODS OF TREATMENT
           Provided herein are methods of treating, preventing or alleviating a symptom of
  conditions and diseases, such as cancers and precancerous conditions, the course of which can be
  influenced by modulating the methylation status of histones or other proteins, wherein said
  methylation status is mediated at least in part by the activity of EZH2. Modulation of the
  methylation status of histones can in turn influence the level of expression of target genes
  activated by methylation, and/or target genes suppressed by methylation.
           For example, one aspect of the invention relates to a method for treating or alleviating a
  symptom of cancer or precancerous condition. The method comprises the step of administering
  to a subject having a cancer or a precancerous condition and expressing a mutant EZH2 a
  therapeutically effective amount of an inhibitor of EZH2. Preferably, a mutant EZH2
  polypeptide or a nucleic acid sequence encoding a mutant EZH2 polypeptide comprises a
  mutation in its substrate pocket domain as defined in SEQ ID NO: 6. More preferablly, a mutant
  EZH2 polypeptide or a nucleic acid sequence encoding a mutant EZH2 polypeptide comprises a
  substitution mutation at amino acid position 677, 687, 674, 685, or 641 of SEQ ID NO: 1, such
  as, but is not limited to a substitution of glycine (G) for the wild type residue alanine (A) at
  amino acid position 677 of SEQ ID NO: 1 (A677G); a substitution of valine (V) for the wild type
  residue alanine (A) at amino acid position 687 of SEQ ID NO: 1 (A687V); a substitution of
  methionine (M) for the wild type residue valine (V) at amino acid position 674 of SEQ ID NO: 1
  (V674M); a substitution of histidine (H) for the wild type residue arginine (R) at amino acid
  position 685 of SEQ ID NO: 1 (R685H); a substitution of cysteine (C) for the wild type residue
  arginine (R) at amino acid position 685 of SEQ ID NO: 1 (R685C); a substitution of
  phenylalanine (F) for the wild type residue tyrosine (Y) at amino acid position 641 of SEQ ID
5 NO: 1 (Y641F); a substitution of histidine (H) for the wild type residue tyrosine (Y) at amino
  acid position 641 of SEQ ID NO: 1 (Y641H); a substitution of asparagine (N) for the wild type
  residue tyrosine (Y) at amino acid position 641 of SEQ ID NO: 1 (Y641N); a substitution of
  seine (S) for the wild type residue tyrosine (Y) at amino acid position 641 of SEQ ID NO: 1
  (Y641S); or a substitution of cysteine (C) for the wild type residue tyrosine (Y) at amino acid
9 position 641 of SEQ ID NO: 1 (Y641C).

          In one embodiment the inhibitor inhibits histone methyltransferase activity of the mutant
  EZH2. In one embodiment the inhibitor selectively inhibits histone methyltransferase activity of
  the mutant EZH2. Optionally, the cancer is a lymphoma. Preferably, the cancer is a non
  Hodgkin lymphoma, a follicular lymphoma or a diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).
  Alternatively, the cancer is leukemia (such as CML) or melanoma. The precancerous condition
  includes, but is not limited to, myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS, formerly known as
  preleukemia).
          Diseases such as cancers and neurological disease can be treated by administration of
  modulators of protein (e.g., histone) methylation, e.g., modulators of histone methyltransferase,
  or histone demethylase enzyme activity. Histone methylation has been reported to be involved
  in aberrant expression of certain genes in cancers, and in silencing of neuronal genes in non
  neuronal cells. Modulators described herein can be used to treat such diseases, i.e., to inhibit
  methylation of histones in affected cells.
          Based at least on the fact that abnormal histone methylation has been found to be
  associated with certain cancers and precancerous conditions, a method for treating cancer or a
  precancerous condition with a mutant EZH2 in a subject comprises administering to the subject
  in need thereof a therapeutically effective amount of a compound that inhibits methylation or
  restores methylation to roughly its level in counterpart normal cells. In one embodiment a
  method for treating cancer or a precancerous condition in a subject comprises administering to
  the subject in need thereof a therapeutically effective amount of a compound that inhibits
  conversion of unmethylated H3-K27 to monomethylated H3-K27 (H3-K27mel). In one
  embodiment a method for treating cancer or a precancerous condition in a subject comprises
  administering to the subject in need thereof a therapeutically effective amount of a compound
  that inhibits conversion of monomethylated H3-K27 (H3-K27mel) to dimethylated H3-K27
5 (H3-K27me2). In one embodiment a method for treating cancer or a precancerous condition in a
  subject comprises administering to the subject in need thereof a therapeutically effective amount
  of a compound that inhibits conversion of H3-K27me2 to trimethylated H3-K27 (H3-K27me3).
  In one embodiment a method for treating cancer or a precancerous condition in a subject
  comprises administering to the subject in need thereof a therapeutically effective amount of a
9 compound that inhibits both conversion of H3-K27mel to H3-K27me2 and conversion of H3
  K27me2 to H3-K27me3. It is important to note that disease-specific increase in methylation can
                                                    48

  occur at chromatin in key genomic loci in the absence of a global increase in cellular levels of
  histone or protein methylation. For example, it is possible for aberrant hypermethylation at key
  disease-relevant genes to occur against a backdrop of global histone or protein hypomethylation.
          Modulators of methylation can be used for modulating cell proliferation, generally. For
  example, in some cases excessive proliferation may be reduced with agents that decrease
  methylation, whereas insufficient proliferation may be stimulated with agents that increase
  methylation. Accordingly, diseases that may be treated include hyperproliferative diseases, such
  as benign cell growth and malignant cell growth (cancer).
          Exemplary cancers that may be treated include lymphomas, including non-Hodgkin
  lymphoma, follicular lymphoma (FL) and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL); melanoma;
  and leukemia, including CML. Exemplary precancerous condition includes myelodisplastic
  syndrome (MDS; formerly known as preleukemia).

  Spinocerebellar Ataxia 2 (SCA2), Machado-Joseph Disease (MJD; SCA3), Spinocerebellar
  Ataxia 6 (SCA6), Spinocerebellar Ataxia 7 (SCA7), and Spinocerebellar Ataxia 12 (SCA12).
  COMBINATION THERAPY
           In one aspect of the invention, an EZH2 antagonist, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt
  thereof, can be used in combination with another therapeutic agent to treat diseases such as
  cancer and/or neurological disorders. For example, the additional agent can be a therapeutic
  agent that is art-recognized as being useful to treat the disease or condition being treated by the
  compound of the present invention. The additional agent also can be an agent that imparts a
  beneficial attribute to the therapeutic composition (e.g., an agent that affects the viscosity of the
  composition).
           The combination therapy contemplated by the invention includes, for example,
  administration of a compound of the invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and
5 additional agent(s) in a single pharmaceutical formulation as well as administration of a
  compound of the invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and additional agent(s)
  in separate pharmaceutical formulations. In other words, co-administration shall mean the
  administration of at least two agents to a subject so as to provide the beneficial effects of the
  combination of both agents. For example, the agents may be administered simultaneously or
9 sequentially over a period of time.

          The agents set forth below are for illustrative purposes and not intended to be limiting.
  The combinations, which are part of this invention, can be the compounds of the present

  DOSAGE
9         As used herein, a "therapeutically effective amount" or "therapeutically effective dose" is
                                                    52

       WO 2013/138361                                                              PCT/US2013/030565
  an amount of an EZH2 antagonist or a combination of two or more such compounds, which
  inhibits, totally or partially, the progression of the condition or alleviates, at least partially, one or
  more symptoms of the condition. A therapeutically effective amount can also be an amount
  which is prophylactically effective. The amount which is therapeutically effective will depend
  upon the patient's size and gender, the condition to be treated, the severity of the condition and
  the result sought. In one embodiment, a therapeutically effective dose refers to that amount of
  the EZH2 antagonists that result in amelioration of symptoms in a patient. For a given patient, a
  therapeutically effective amount may be determined by methods known to those of skill in the
  art.
          Toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of EZH2 antagonists can be determined by standard
  pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, e.g., for determining the
  maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the ED50 (effective dose for 50% maximal response). The
  dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and it can be expressed
  as the ratio between MTD and ED50 . The data obtained from these cell culture assays and animal
  studies can be used in formulating a range of dosage for use in humans. Dosage may also be
  guided by monitoring the EZH2 antagonist's effect on pharmacodynamic markers of enzyme
  inhibition (e.g., histone methylation or target gene expression) in diseased or surrogate tissue.
  Cell culture or animal experiments can be used to determine the relationship between doses
  required for changes in pharmacodynamic markers and doses required for therapeutic efficacy
  can be determined in cell culture or animal experiments or early stage clinical trials. The dosage
  of such EZH2 antagonists lies preferably within a range of circulating concentrations that include
  the ED5 0 with little or no toxicity. The dosage may vary within this range depending upon the
  dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized. The exact formulation, route of
  administration and dosage can be chosen by the individual physician in view of the patient's
5 condition. In the treatment of crises, the administration of an acute bolus or an infusion
  approaching the MTD may be required to obtain a rapid response.
          Dosage amount and interval may be adjusted individually to provide plasma levels of the
  active moiety which are sufficient to maintain the methyltransferase modulating effects, or
  minimal effective concentration (MEC) for the required period of time to achieve therapeutic
9 efficacy. The MEC will vary for each EZH2 antagonist but can be estimated from in vitro data
  and animal experiments. Dosages necessary to achieve the MEC will depend on individual
                                                      53

        WO 2013/138361                                                          PCT/US2013/030565
  characteristics and route of administration. However, high pressure liquid chromatography
  (HPLC) assays or bioassays can be used to determine plasma concentrations.
          Dosage intervals can also be determined using the MEC value. In certain embodiments,
  EZH2 antagonists should be administered using a regimen which maintains plasma levels above
  the MEC for 10-90% of the time, preferably between 30-90% and most preferably between 50
  90% until the desired amelioration of symptoms is achieved. In other embodiments, different
  MEC plasma levels will be maintained for differing amounts of time. In cases of local
  administration or selective uptake, the effective local concentration of the drug may not be
  related to plasma concentration.
          One of skill in the art can select from a variety of administration regimens and the
  amount of EZH2 antagonist administered will, of course, be dependent on the subject being
  treated, on the subject's weight, the severity of the affliction, the manner of administration and
  the judgment of the prescribing physician.

          Unless otherwise indicated, the term "substituted" means substituted by one or more
  defined groups. In the case where groups may be selected from a number of alternative groups
  the selected groups may be the same or different.
          The term "independently" means that where more than one substituent is selected from a
5 number of possible substituents, those substituents may be the same or different.

              An "effective amount" means that amount of a drug or pharmaceutical agent that will
  elicit the biological or medical response of a tissue, system, animal or human that is being
  sought, for instance, by a researcher or clinician. Furthermore, the term "therapeutically
  effective amount" means any amount which, as compared to a corresponding subject who has
  not received such amount, results in improved treatment, healing, prevention, or amelioration of
  a disease, disorder, or side effect, or a decrease in the rate of advancement of a disease or
  disorder. The term also includes within its scope amounts effective to enhance normal
  physiological function.
              As used herein, "alkyl", "C1 , C 2 , C 3 , C 4 , C5 or C6 alkyl" or "C1 -C 6 alkyl" is intended to
  include C 1, C 2 , C 3 , C 4 , C5 or C6 straight chain (linear) saturated aliphatic hydrocarbon groups and
  C 3 , C 4 , C5 or C6 branched saturated aliphatic hydrocarbon groups. For example, CI-C 6 alkyl is
  intended to include C1 , C 2 , C 3 , C 4 , C5 and C6 alkyl groups. Examples of alkyl include, moieties
  having from one to six carbon atoms, such as, but not limited to, methyl, ethyl, n-propyl,
  i-propyl, n-butyl, s-butyl, t-butyl, n-pentyl, s-pentyl or n-hexyl.
              In certain embodiments, a straight chain or branched alkyl has six or fewer carbon atoms
  (e.g., C 1-C6 for straight chain, C3-C6 for branched chain), and in another embodiment, a straight
  chain or branched alkyl has four or fewer carbon atoms.
              As used herein, the term "cycloalkyl" refers to a saturated or unsaturated nonaromatic
  hydrocarbon mono-or multi-ring (e.g., fused, bridged, or spiro rings) system having 3 to 30
  carbon atoms (e.g., C 3-Cio). Examples of cycloalkyl include, but are not limited to, cyclopropyl,
  cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, cycloheptyl, cyclooctyl, cyclopentenyl, cyclohexenyl,
  cycloheptenyl, and adamantyl. The term "heterocycloalkyl" refers to a saturated or unsaturated
  nonaromatic 3-8 membered monocyclic, 7-12 membered bicyclic (fused, bridged, or spiro rings),
  or 11-14 membered tricyclic ring system (fused, bridged, or spiro rings) having one or more
5 heteroatoms (such as 0, N, S, or Se), unless specified otherwise. Examples of heterocycloalkyl

  methylenedioxyphenyl).
            As used herein, "carbocycle" or "carbocyclic ring" is intended to include any stable
  monocyclic, bicyclic or tricyclic ring having the specified number of carbons, any of which may

          The term "substituted," as used herein, means that any one or more hydrogen atoms on
  the designated atom is replaced with a selection from the indicated groups, provided that the
  designated atom's normal valency is not exceeded, and that the substitution results in a stable
  compound. When a substituent is oxo or keto (i.e., =0), then 2 hydrogen atoms on the atom are
  replaced. Keto substituents are not present on aromatic moieties. Ring double bonds, as used
5 herein, are double bonds that are formed between two adjacent ring atoms (e.g., C=C, C=N or
  N=N). "Stable compound" and "stable structure" are meant to indicate a compound that is
  sufficiently robust to survive isolation to a useful degree of purity from a reaction mixture, and
  formulation into an efficacious therapeutic agent.
          When a bond to a substituent is shown to cross a bond connecting two atoms in a ring,
9 then such substituent may be bonded to any atom in the ring. When a substituent is listed
  without indicating the atom via which such substituent is bonded to the rest of the compound of a

  given formula, then such substituent may be bonded via any atom in such formula.
  Combinations of substituents and/or variables are permissible, but only if such combinations
  result in stable compounds.
           When any variable (e.g., R 1) occurs more than one time in any constituent or formula for
  a compound, its definition at each occurrence is independent of its definition at every other
  occurrence. Thus, for example, if a group is shown to be substituted with 0-2 R1 moieties, then
  the group may optionally be substituted with up to two R1 moieties and R1 at each occurrence is
  selected independently from the definition of R 1 . Also, combinations of substituents and/or
  variables are permissible, but only if such combinations result in stable compounds.

  occur, and includes both event(s), which occur, and events that do not occur.
           Herein, the term "pharmaceutically-acceptable salts" refers to salts that retain the desired
  biological activity of the subject compound and exhibit minimal undesired toxicological effects.
  These pharmaceutically-acceptable salts may be prepared in situ during the final isolation and
  purification of the compound, or by separately reacting the purified compound in its free acid or
  free base form with a suitable base or acid, respectively.
           By the term "co-administering" and derivatives thereof as used herein is meant either
  simultaneous administration or any manner of separate sequential administration of one or more
  additional pharmaceutically active compounds, whether for treating cancer, the side effects of
  cancer or cancer therapy, or some other disease. Preferably, if the administration is not
  simultaneous, the compounds are administered in a close time proximity to each other.
  Furthermore, it does not matter if the compounds are administered in the same dosage form, e.g.
  one compound may be administered topically and another compound may be administered
  orally.
           The compounds of Formulae (J)-(JJJ) include the compounds themselves, as well as their
5 salts, their solvates, their N-oxides, and their prodrugs, if applicable. In certain embodiments,
  compounds according to Formulae (I)-(III) may contain an acidic functional group, one acidic
  enough to form salts. Representative salts include pharmaceutically acceptable metal salts such

           In certain embodiments, compounds according to Formulae (J)-(JJJ) may contain a basic
  functional group and are therefore capable of forming pharmaceutically-acceptable acid addition
  salts by treatment with a suitable acid. Suitable acids include pharmaceutically-acceptable
  inorganic acids and pharmaceutically-acceptable organic acids. Representative pharmaceutically
  acceptable acid addition salts include hydrochloride, hydrobromide, nitrate, methylnitrate,

           Compounds of the present invention that contain nitrogens can be converted to N-oxides
  by treatment with an oxidizing agent (e.g., 3-chloroperoxybenzoic acid (mCPBA) and/or
  hydrogen peroxides) to afford other compounds of the present invention. Thus, all shown and
  claimed nitrogen-containing compounds are considered, when allowed by valency and structure,
  to include both the compound as shown and its N-oxide derivative (which can be designated as
  N->O or N*-O-). Furthermore, in other instances, the nitrogens in the compounds of the present
  invention can be converted to N-hydroxy or N-alkoxy compounds. For example, N-hydroxy
  compounds can be prepared by oxidation of the parent amine by an oxidizing agent such as
  m-CPBA. All shown and claimed nitrogen-containing compounds are also considered, when
5 allowed by valency and structure, to cover both the compound as shown and its N-hydroxy (i.e.,
  N-OH) and N-alkoxy (i.e., N-OR, wherein R is substituted or unsubstituted C1 -C 6 alkyl, C1
  C6 alkenyl, CI-C 6 alkynyl, 3-14-membered carbocycle or 3-14-membered heterocycle)

           In the present specification, the structural formula of the compound represents a certain
9 isomer for convenience in some cases, but the present invention includes all isomers, such as
  geometrical isomers, optical isomers based on an asymmetrical carbon, stereoisomers, tautomers,
                                                     121

  and the like. In addition, a crystal polymorphism may be present for the compounds represented
  by the formula. It is noted that any crystal form, crystal form mixture, or anhydride or hydrate
  thereof is included in the scope of the present invention. Furthermore, so-called metabolite
  which is produced by degradation of the present compound in vivo is included in the scope of the
  present invention.
           "Isomerism" means compounds that have identical molecular formulae but differ in the
  sequence of bonding of their atoms or in the arrangement of their atoms in space. Isomers that
  differ in the arrangement of their atoms in space are termed "stereoisomers." Stereoisomers that
  are not mirror images of one another are termed "diastereoisomers," and stereoisomers that are
  non-superimposable mirror images of each other are termed "enantiomers" or sometimes optical
  isomers. A mixture containing equal amounts of individual enantiomeric forms of opposite
  chirality is termed a "racemic mixture."
           A carbon atom bonded to four nonidentical substituents is termed a "chiral center."
           "Chiral isomer" means a compound with at least one chiral center. Compounds with
  more than one chiral center may exist either as an individual diastereomer or as a mixture of
  diastereomers, termed "diastereomeric mixture." When one chiral center is present, a
  stereoisomer may be characterized by the absolute configuration (R or S) of that chiral center.
  Absolute configuration refers to the arrangement in space of the substituents attached to the
  chiral center. The substituents attached to the chiral center under consideration are ranked in
  accordance with the Sequence Rule of Cahn, Ingold and Prelog. (Cahn et al., Angew. Chem.
  Inter. Edit. 1966, 5, 385; errata 511; Cahn et al., Angew. Chem. 1966, 78, 413; Cahn and Ingold,
  J. Chem. Soc. 1951 (London), 612; Cahn et al., Experientia 1956, 12, 81; Cahn, J. Chem. Educ.
  1964, 41, 116).
           "Geometric isomer" means the diastereomers that owe their existence to hindered
5 rotation about double bonds or a cycloalkyl linker (e.g., 1,3-cylcobutyl). These configurations
  are differentiated in their names by the prefixes cis and trans, or Z and E, which indicate that the
  groups are on the same or opposite side of the double bond in the molecule according to the
  Cahn-Ingold-Prelog rules.
           It is to be understood that the compounds of the present invention may be depicted as
9 different chiral isomers or geometric isomers. It should also be understood that when
  compounds have chiral isomeric or geometric isomeric forms, all isomeric forms are intended to
                                                   122

     WO 2013/138361                                                            PCT/US2013/030565
be included in the scope of the present invention, and the naming of the compounds does not
exclude any isomeric forms.
        Furthermore, the structures and other compounds discussed in this invention include all
atropic isomers thereof. "Atropic isomers" are a type of stereoisomer in which the atoms of two
isomers are arranged differently in space. Atropic isomers owe their existence to a restricted
rotation caused by hindrance of rotation of large groups about a central bond. Such atropic
isomers typically exist as a mixture, however as a result of recent advances in chromatography
techniques, it has been possible to separate mixtures of two atropic isomers in select cases.
        "Tautomer" is one of two or more structural isomers that exist in equilibrium and is
readily converted from one isomeric form to another. This conversion results in the formal
migration of a hydrogen atom accompanied by a switch of adjacent conjugated double bonds.
Tautomers exist as a mixture of a tautomeric set in solution.   In solutions where tautomerization
is possible, a chemical equilibrium of the tautomers will be reached. The exact ratio of the
tautomers depends on several factors, including temperature, solvent and pH. The concept of
tautomers that are interconvertable by tautomerizations is called tautomerism.
        Of the various types of tautomerism that are possible, two are commonly observed. In
keto-enol tautomerism a simultaneous shift of electrons and a hydrogen atom occurs. Ring-chain
tautomerism arises as a result of the aldehyde group (-CHO) in a sugar chain molecule reacting
with one of the hydroxy groups (-OH) in the same molecule to give it a cyclic (ring-shaped) form
as exhibited by glucose.
        Common tautomeric pairs are: ketone-enol, amide-nitrile, lactam-lactim, amide-imidic
acid tautomerism in heterocyclic rings (e.g., in nucleobases such as guanine, thymine and
cytosine), imine-enamine and enamine-enamine. An example of keto-enol equilibria is between
pyridin-2(1H)-ones and the corresponding pyridin-2-ols, as shown below.
                                          0                             OH

        It is to be understood that the compounds of the present invention may be depicted as
different tautomers. It should also be understood that when compounds have tautomeric forms,

  all tautomeric forms, including mixtures thereof, are intended to be included in the scope of the
  present invention, and the naming of the compounds does not exclude any tautomer form.
           The compounds of Formulae (I)-(III) may be prepared in crystalline or non-crystalline
  form, and, if crystalline, may optionally be solvated, e.g., as the hydrate. This invention includes
  within its scope stoichiometric solvates (e.g., hydrates) as well as compounds containing variable
  amounts of solvent (e.g., water).
           Certain of the compounds described herein may contain one or more chiral atoms, or may
  otherwise be capable of existing as two enantiomers. The compounds claimed below include
  mixtures of enantiomers as well as purified enantiomers or enantiomerically enriched mixtures.
  Also included within the scope of the invention are the individual isomers of the compounds
  represented by Formulae (I)-(III), or claimed below, as well as any wholly or partially
  equilibrated mixtures thereof. The present invention also covers the individual isomers of the
  claimed compounds as mixtures with isomers thereof in which one or more chiral centers are
  inverted.
           Where there are different isomeric forms they may be separated or resolved one from the
  other by conventional methods, or any given isomer may be obtained by conventional synthetic
  methods or by stereospecific or asymmetric syntheses.
           While it is possible that, for use in therapy, a compound of Formulae (I)-(III), as well as
  salts, solvates, N-oxides, and the like, may be administered as a neat preparation, i.e., no
  additional carrier, the more usual practice is to present the active ingredient confected with a
  carrier or diluent. Accordingly, the invention further provides pharmaceutical compositions,
  which includes a compound of Formulae (I)-(III) and salts, solvates and the like, and one or more
  pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, diluents, or excipients. The compounds of Formulae (I)
  (III) and salts, solvates, N-oxides, etc, are as described above. The carrier(s), diluent, or
5 excipient(s) must be acceptable in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the
  formulation and not deleterious to the recipient thereof. In accordance with another aspect of the
  invention there is also provided a process for the preparation of a pharmaceutical formulation
  including admixing a compound of the Formulae (I)-(III), or salts, solvates, N-oxides, etc, with
  one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, diluents or excipients.
9          It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that certain protected derivatives of
  compounds of Formulae (I)-(III), which may be made prior to a final deprotection stage, may not

  possess pharmacological activity as such, but may, in certain instances, be administered orally or
  parenterally and thereafter metabolized in the body to form compounds of the invention which
  are pharmacologically active. Such derivatives may therefore be described as "prodrugs".
  Further, certain compounds of the invention may act as prodrugs of other compounds of the
  invention. All protected derivatives and prodrugs of compounds of the invention are included
  within the scope of the invention. It will further be appreciated by those skilled in the art, that
  certain moieties, known to those skilled in the art as "pro-moieties" may be placed on
  appropriate functionalities when such functionalities are present within compounds of the
  invention. Preferred prodrugs for compounds of the invention include: esters, carbonate esters,
  hemi-esters, phosphate esters, nitro esters, sulfate esters, sulfoxides, amides, carbamates, azo
  compounds, phosphamides, glycosides, ethers, acetals, and ketals.
          Additionally, the compounds of the present invention, for example, the salts of the
  compounds, can exist in either hydrated or unhydrated (the anhydrous) form or as solvates with
  other solvent molecules. Nonlimiting examples of hydrates include monohydrates, dihydrates,
  etc. Nonlimiting examples of solvates include ethanol solvates, acetone solvates, etc.
          "Solvate" means solvent addition forms that contain either stoichiometric or non
  stoichiometric amounts of solvent. Some compounds have a tendency to trap a fixed molar ratio
  of solvent molecules in the crystalline solid state, thus forming a solvate. If the solvent is water
  the solvate formed is a hydrate; and if the solvent is alcohol, the solvate formed is an alcoholate.
  Hydrates are formed by the combination of one or more molecules of water with one molecule of
  the substance in which the water retains its molecular state as H 20.
          As used herein, the term "analog" refers to a chemical compound that is structurally
  similar to another but differs slightly in composition (as in the replacement of one atom by an
  atom of a different element or in the presence of a particular functional group, or the replacement
5 of one functional group by another functional group). Thus, an analog is a compound that is
  similar or comparable in function and appearance, but not in structure or origin to the reference
  compound.
          As defined herein, the term "derivative" refers to compounds that have a common core
  structure, and are substituted with various groups as described herein. For example, all of the
9 compounds represented by Formula (I) are aryl- or heteroaryl-substituted benzene compounds,
  and have Formula (I) as a common core.

        The term "bioisostere" refers to a compound resulting from the exchange of an atom or of
a group of atoms with another, broadly similar, atom or group of atoms. The objective of a
bioisosteric replacement is to create a new compound with similar biological properties to the
parent compound. The bioisosteric replacement may be physicochemically or topologically
based. Examples of carboxylic acid bioisosteres include, but are not limited to, acyl
sulfonimides, tetrazoles, sulfonates and phosphonates. See, e.g., Patani and LaVoie, Chem. Rev.
96, 3147-3176, 1996.

compounds. Isotopes include those atoms having the same atomic number but different mass
numbers. By way of general example and without limitation, isotopes of hydrogen include
tritium and deuterium, and isotopes of carbon include C-13 and C-14.

  pharmaceutically acceptable, but non-pharmaceutically acceptable salts can conveniently be used
  to prepare pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.
           Compounds useful in accordance with the invention may be provided as salts with
  pharmaceutically compatible counterions (i.e., pharmaceutically acceptable salts). A
  "pharmaceutically acceptable salt" means any non-toxic salt that, upon administration to a
  recipient, is capable of providing, either directly or indirectly, a compound or a prodrug of a
  compound useful in accordance with this invention. A "pharmaceutically acceptable counterion"
  is an ionic portion of a salt that is not toxic when released from the salt upon administration to a
  subject. Pharmaceutically compatible salts may be formed with many acids, including but not
  limited to hydrochloric, sulfuric, acetic, lactic, tartaric, malic, and succinic acids. Salts tend to be
  more soluble in water or other protic solvents than their corresponding free base forms. The
  present invention includes the use of such salts.
           Pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts include those formed with mineral acids
  such as hydrochloric acid and hydrobromic acid, and also those formed with organic acids such
  as maleic acid. For example, acids commonly employed to form pharmaceutically acceptable
  salts include inorganic acids such as hydrogen bisulfide, hydrochloric, hydrobromic, hydroiodic,
  sulfuric and phosphoric acid, as well as organic acids such as para-toluenesulfonic, salicylic,
  tartaric, bitartaric, ascorbic, maleic, besylic, fumaric, gluconic, glucuronic, formic, glutamic,

  N-methyl,N-ethylamine; diethylamine; triethylamine; mono-, bis-, or tris-(2-hydroxy-lower alkyl
  amines), such as mono-, bis-, or tris-(2-hydroxyethyl)amine, 2-hydroxy-tert-butylamine, or tris
  (hydroxymethyl)methylamine, N,N-di alkyl-N-(hydroxy alkyl)-amines, such as N,N-dimethyl-N

          Certain compounds useful in accordance with the invention and their salts may exist in
  more than one crystalline form (i.e., polymorph); the present invention includes the use of each
  of the crystal forms and mixtures thereof.
          Certain compounds useful in accordance with the invention may contain one or more
  chiral centers, and exist in different optically active forms. When compounds useful in
  accordance with the invention contain one chiral center, the compounds exist in two
  enantiomeric forms and the present invention includes the use of both enantiomers and mixtures
  of enantiomers, such as racemic mixtures thereof. The enantiomers may be resolved by methods
  known to those skilled in the art; for example, enantiomers may be resolved by formation of
  diastereoisomeric salts which may be separated, for example, by crystallization; formation of
  diastereoisomeric derivatives or complexes which may be separated, for example, by
  crystallization, gas-liquid or liquid chromatography; selective reaction of one enantiomer with an
  enantiomer-specific reagent, for example, via enzymatic esterification; or gas-liquid or liquid
  chromatography in a chiral environment, for example, on a chiral support (e.g., silica with a
  bound chiral ligand) or in the presence of a chiral solvent. Where the desired enantiomer is
5 converted into another chemical entity by one of the separation procedures described above, a
  further step may be used to liberate the desired purified enantiomer. Alternatively, specific
  enantiomers may be synthesized by asymmetric synthesis using optically active reagents,
  substrates, catalysts or solvents, or by converting one enantiomer into the other by asymmetric
  transformation.

  DEFINITIONS
          For convenience, certain terms employed in the specification, examples, and appended
  claims are collected here. All definitions, as defined and used herein, supersede dictionary
  definitions, definitions in documents incorporated by reference, and/or ordinary meanings of the
  defined terms.
          The articles "a" and "an" are used herein to refer to one or to more than one (i.e., to at
  least one) of the grammatical object of the article. By way of example, "an element" means one
  element or more than one element.
          The phrase "and/or," as used herein in the specification and in the claims, should be
  understood to mean "either or both" of the elements so conjoined, i.e., elements that are
  conjunctively present in some cases and disjunctively present in other cases. Multiple elements
  listed with "and/or" should be construed in the same fashion, i.e., "one or more" of the elements
  so conjoined. Other elements may optionally be present other than the elements specifically
  identified by the "and/or" clause, whether related or unrelated to those elements specifically
  identified. Thus, as a non-limiting example, a reference to "A and/or B", when used in
  conjunction with open-ended language such as "comprising" can refer, in one embodiment, to A
  only (optionally including elements other than B); in another embodiment, to B only (optionally
  including elements other than A); in yet another embodiment, to both A and B (optionally
  including other elements); etc.
          As used herein in the specification and in the claims, "or" should be understood to have
5 the same meaning as "and/or" as defined above. For example, when separating items in a list,
  "or" or "and/or" shall be interpreted as being inclusive, i.e., the inclusion of at least one, but also
  including more than one, of a number or list of elements, and, optionally, additional unlisted
  items. Only terms clearly indicated to the contrary, such as "only one of' or "exactly one of," or,
  when used in the claims, "consisting of," will refer to the inclusion of exactly one element of a
9 number or list of elements. In general, the term "or" as used herein shall only be interpreted as
                                                   130

        WO 2013/138361                                                             PCT/US2013/030565
  indicating exclusive alternatives (i.e., "one or the other but not both") when preceded by terms of
  exclusivity, such as "either," "one of," "only one of," or "exactly one of." "Consisting
  essentially of," when used in the claims, shall have its ordinary meaning as used in the field of
  patent law.
           As used herein in the specification and in the claims, the phrase "at least one," in
  reference to a list of one or more elements, should be understood to mean at least one element
  selected from any one or more of the elements in the list of elements, but not necessarily
  including at least one of each and every element specifically listed within the list of elements and
  not excluding any combinations of elements in the list of elements. This definition also allows
  that elements may optionally be present other than the elements specifically identified within the
  list of elements to which the phrase "at least one" refers, whether related or unrelated to those
  elements specifically identified. Thus, as a non-limiting example, "at least one of A and B" (or,
  equivalently, "at least one of A or B," or, equivalently "at least one of A and/or B") can refer, in
  one embodiment, to at least one, optionally including more than one, A, with no B present (and
  optionally including elements other than B); in another embodiment, to at least one, optionally
  including more than one, B, with no A present (and optionally including elements other than A);
  in yet another embodiment, to at least one, optionally including more than one, A, and at least
  one, optionally including more than one, B (and optionally including other elements); etc.
           It should also be understood that, unless clearly indicated to the contrary, in any methods
  claimed herein that include more than one step or act, the order of the steps or acts of the method
  is not necessarily limited to the order in which the steps or acts of the method are recited.
           In the claims, as well as in the specification above, all transitional phrases such as
  "comprising," "including," "carrying," "having," "containing," "involving," "holding,"
  "composed of," and the like are to be understood to be open-ended, i.e., to mean including but
5 not limited to. Only the transitional phrases "consisting of' and "consisting essentially of' shall
  be closed or semi-closed transitional phrases, respectively, as set forth in the United States Patent
  Office Manual of Patent Examining Procedures, Section 2111.03.
           The terms "co-administration" and "co-administering" refer to both concurrent
  administration (administration of two or more therapeutic agents at the same time) and time
9 varied administration (administration of one or more therapeutic agents at a time different from
                                                     131

        WO 2013/138361                                                           PCT/US2013/030565
  that of the administration of an additional therapeutic agent or agents), as long as the therapeutic
  agents are present in the patient to some extent at the same time.
           The term "precancerous condition" or "premalignant condition" refers to a disease,
  syndrome, or finding that, if left untreated, may lead to cancer. It is a generalized state associated
  with a significantly increased risk of cancer.
           The term "treating" as used herein refers to alleviate of at least one symptom of the
  disease, disorder or condition. The term encompasses the administration and/or application of
  one or more compounds described herein, to a subject, for the purpose of providing management
  of, or remedy for a condition. "Treatment" for the purposes of this disclosure, may, but does not
  have to, provide a cure; rather, "treatment" may be in the form of management of the condition.
  When the compounds described herein are used to treat unwanted proliferating cells, including
  cancers, "treatment" includes partial or total destruction of the undesirable proliferating cells
  with minimal destructive effects on normal cells. A desired mechanism of treatment of
  unwanted rapidly proliferating cells, including cancer cells, at the cellular level is apoptosis.
           The term "preventing" as used herein includes either preventing or slowing the onset of a
  clinically evident disease progression altogether or preventing or slowing the onset of a
  preclinically evident stage of a disease in individuals at risk. This includes prophylactic
  treatment of those at risk of developing a disease.
           The term "subject" as used herein for purposes of treatment includes any human subject
  who has been diagnosed with, has symptoms of, or is at risk of developing a cancer or a
  precancerous condition. For methods of prevention the subject is any human subject. To
  illustrate, for purposes of prevention, a subject may be a human subject who is at risk of or is
  genetically predisposed to obtaining a disorder characterized by unwanted, rapid cell
  proliferation, such as cancer. The subject may be at risk due to exposure to carcinogenic agents,
5 being genetically predisposed to disorders characterized by unwanted, rapid cell proliferation,
  and so on.
           Except as otherwise indicated, standard methods can be used for the production of
  recombinant and synthetic polypeptides, fusion proteins, antibodies or antigen-binding fragments
  thereof, manipulation of nucleic acid sequences, production of transformed cells, and the like.
9 Such techniques are known to those skilled in the art. See, e.g., Sambrook et al., Molecular
                                                    132

         The term "EZH2 polypeptide" encompasses functional fragments of the full-length
polypeptides and functional equivalents of either of the foregoing that have substantially similar
or substantially identical amino acid sequences (at least about 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95% 98%
or more amino acid sequence similarity or identity), where the functional fragment or functional
equivalent retains one or more of the functional properties of the native polypeptide.
         By "functional" it is meant that the polypeptide (or nucleic acid) has the same or
substantially similar activity with respect to one or more of the biological properties of the native
polypeptide (or nucleic acid), e.g., at least about 50%, 75%, 85%, 90%, 95% or 98% or more of
the activity of the native polypeptide (or nucleic acid).
         The term "modulate" (and grammatical equivalents) refers to an increase or decrease in
activity. In particular embodiments, the term "increase" or "enhance" (and grammatical
equivalents) means an elevation by at least about 25%, 50%, 75%, 2-fold, 3-fold, 5-fold, 10-fold,
15-fold, 20-fold or more. In particular embodiments, the terms "decrease" or "reduce" (and
grammatical equivalents) means a diminishment by at least about 25%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 75%,
80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 98% or more. In some embodiments, the indicated activity, substance or
other parameter is not detectable. Specifically provided are antagonists of EZH2.
         The term "pharmacodynamic marker" refers to a molecular marker of drug response that
can be measured in patients receiving the drug. The marker should be a direct measure of
modulation of the drug target and be able to show quantitative changes in response to dose. A
potential pharmacodynamic marker for EZH2 antagonists could be levels of histone H3-K27
methylation in disease or surrogate tissue.
         As used herein, the term "responsiveness" is interchangeable with terms "responsive",
"sensitive", and "sensitivity", and it is meant that a subject showing therapeutic response when
administered an EZH inhibitor, e.g., tumor cells or tumor tissues of the subject undergo apoptosis
and/or necrosis, and/or display reduced growing, dividing, or proliferation..
         The term "control" or "reference" refers to methylation levels (e.g., monomethylation
                                                  133

  level, dimethylation level or trimethylation level) detected in an adjacent non-tumor tissue
  isolated from the subject, detected in a healthy tissue from a healthy subject, or established by a
  pathologist with standard methods in the art.
           By "sample" it means any biological sample derived from the subject, includes but is not
  limited to, cells, tissues samples and body fluids (including, but not limited to, mucus, blood,
  plasma, serum, urine, saliva, and semen).
           Throughout the description, where compositions are described as having, including, or
  comprising specific components, it is contemplated that compositions also consist essentially of,
  or consist of, the recited components. Similarly, where methods or processes are described as
  having, including, or comprising specific process steps, the processes also consist essentially of,
  or consist of, the recited processing steps. Further, it should be understood that the order of steps
  or order for performing certain actions is immaterial so long as the invention remains operable.
  Moreover, two or more steps or actions can be conducted simultaneously.
           The synthetic processes of the invention can tolerate a wide variety of functional groups;
  therefore various substituted starting materials can be used. The processes generally provide the
  desired final compound at or near the end of the overall process, although it may be desirable in
  certain instances to further convert the compound to a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, ester or
  prodrug thereof.

  commercially available starting materials, compounds known in the literature, or from readily
  prepared intermediates, by employing standard synthetic methods and procedures either known
  to those skilled in the art, or which will be apparent to the skilled artisan in light of the teachings
  herein. Standard synthetic methods and procedures for the preparation of organic molecules and
  functional group transformations and manipulations can be obtained from the relevant scientific
5 literature or from standard textbooks in the field. Although not limited to any one or several
  sources, classic texts such as Smith, M. B., March, J., March'sAdvanced Organic Chemistry:

  certain aspects and embodiments of the present invention, and are not intended to limit the
  invention.
  Example 1 - Recombinant Five-Component PRC2 Complex
          Wild-type EZH2 (GenBank Accession No. NM_004456) or Tyr641 mutants were co
  expressed with wild-type AEBP2 (GenBank Accession No. NM_153207), EED (GenBank
  Accession No. NM_003797), SUZ12 (GenBank Accession No. NM_015355) and RbAp48
  (GenBank Accession No. NM_005610) in Spodopterafrugiperda(Sf9) cells using a baculovirus
  expression system. An N-terminal FLAG tag on the EED was used to purify active PRC2
  complex from cell lysates (BPS Bioscience, catalog number 51004). The purity of the final
  PRC2 preparations was assessed by SDS-PAGE with Coomassie blue staining.
  Example 2 - H3, H4 Peptide Panel
          A library consisting of 44 peptides of 15 amino acids each was synthesized by 21"
  Century Biochemicals (Marlboro, MA). This peptide panel encompassed all of the amino acids
  of human histones H3 and H4 with 5 residue overlaps between consecutive peptide sequences.
  The N-terminus of each peptide was appended with biotin, and the C-termini were represented as
  the amide. Purity (> 95%) and identity were confirmed by liquid chromatography/mass spectral
  analysis.
          For study of the H3-K27 methylation status dependence of enzyme activity, peptides
  were synthesized representing the amino acid sequence of human H3 from residues 21-44
9 (H3:21-44) with lysine 27 represented as the unmodified, mono-methylated, di-methylated or tri
  methylated side chain amine. These peptides were purchased from New England Peptide
  (Gardner, MA) with biotin appended to the C-terminus of each peptide.
  Example 3 - Evaluation of H3-K27 Methylation Status in Cells
          The cell lines OCI-LY19 (ACC 528), KARPAS-422 (ACC 32), and WSU-DLCL2 (ACC
5 575) were obtained from DSMZ. The cell lines DB (CRL-2289) and SU-DHL6 (CRL-2959)
  were obtained from ATCC. OCI-LY 19, WSU-DLCL2, and DB cell lines were grown in RPMI
  1640 with 10% FBS, and KARPAS-422 and SU-DHL6 cell lines were grown in RPMI-1640
  plus 20% FBS. Cells were grown to a density of 1.5-2 x106 cells/mL and 1 x 107 cells were
  harvested by centrifugation at 264 x g, washed in ice cold PBS and lysed by resuspension in a

  loX pellet volume of RIPA lysis buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, 15 0mM NaCl, 0.25%
  DOC, 1% NP-40, and 1 mM EDTA (Millipore #20-188), plus 0.1% SDS and protease inhibitor
  tablets (Roche # 1836153). Lysates were sonicated by 2 rounds of 10 1-second bursts at setting
  3 with a Misonix XL-2000 to ensure efficient histone extraction, and cleared by centrifugation at
  40 C using a bench top centrifuge at 14,000 rpm for 10 minutes. Protein concentration was
  determined by BCA assay (Pierce). Four micrograms of each lysate was fractionated on 4-20%
  Tris-Glycine gel (Invitrogen), transferred to PVDF, and probed with the following antibodies in
  Odyssey blocking buffer: mouse anti-EZH2 (CST 3147; 1:2000 dilution), rabbit anti-H3
  K27me3 (CST 9733; 1:10000 dilution), rabbit anti-H3-K27me2 (CST 9755; 1:5000 dilution),
  rabbit anti-H3-K27mel (Active Motif 39377; 1:5000 dilution), and mouse anti-Total H3 (CST
  3638; 1:20000 dilution). Following primary Ab incubation, membranes were probed with IRDye
  800CW donkey-anti-mouse IgG (LiCOR #926-32212) or Alexa Fluor 680 goat-anti-rabbit IgG
  (Invitrogen #A-21076) secondary Ab and imaged using the LiCOR Odyssey system.
  Example 4 - Enzymology
           As noted above, it had previously been concluded that the disease-associated changes at
  Tyr641 resulted in loss of function with respect to EZH2-catalyzed H3-K27 methylation.
  However, a presumptive reduction in the rate of H3-K27 methylation due to enzyme
  heterozygosity was difficult to rationalize as the basis for a malignant phenotype, especially in
  light of previous data indicating that overexpression of EZH2, loss-of-function mutations in the
  corresponding H3-K27 demethylase UTX, or overexpression of components of the PRC2, such
  as PHF19/PCL3, involved in increased H3-K27 trimethylation, all result in malignant
  phenotypes in specific human cancers. Morin et al. (2010) Nat Genet 42:181-5; Martinez-Garcia

           Recombinant PRC2 complexes were prepared with WT and Tyr641 mutant versions of

  ability to catalyze 3H-methyl transfer from labeled S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) to an
  unmodified peptide representing the amino acid sequence surrounding H3-K27 (H3:21-44) or to
  native avian erythrocyte oligonucleosomes. As previously reported (Morin et al. (2010) Nat
  Genet 42:181-5), it was found that the WT enzyme displayed robust activity for methyl transfer
  to this unmethylated peptidic substrate, but that none of the mutant enzymes displayed
  significant methyltransferase activity (Figure 1A). In contrast to the previously reported data
  and that in Fig. 1A, it was found that all of the mutant EZH2 constructs were active
  methyltransferases against the avian nucleosome substrate (Figure 1B). The nucleosomes
  isolated from the avian natural source represent an admixture of states of histone modification,
  including various states of H3-K27 methylation as judged by Western blotting with H3-K27
  methylation- specific antibodies.
           There are several potential explanations for the discordant activity of the mutant PRC2
  complexes on peptide and nucleosome substrates. One possibility is that substrate recognition
  sites distal to the enzyme active site (i.e., exosites) are important determinants of substrate
  binding and turnover; these sites would engage complementary recognition elements on the
  nucleosome that are not available on small peptidic substrates. However, when E. coli
  expressed, recombinant human histone H3 was tested as a substrate for the WT and mutant
  PRC2 complexes, the resulting pattern of activity was identical to that seen for the peptide
  substrate; that is, the WT enzyme demonstrated robust methyltransferase activity against the H3
  substrate, the Y641F mutant showed 7% the activity of WT complex, and all other mutants
  displayed < 1% the activity of WT complex. Hence, exosite engagement seems an unlikely
  explanation for the current results. The nucleosome presents many lysine residues beyond H3
  K27 as potential sites of methylation that would not be present in the small peptidic substrate.
  Thus, another possibility is that mutation of Y641 alters the substrate specificity of EZH2 to
5 result in methylation of lysine residues other than H3-K27. This possibility is unlikely given the
  excellent agreement between mutant activity on small peptide and recombinant H3 protein
  substrates.
           The apparent discordance between the present results and those previously reported was
  resolved when the enzymatic activity of the WT and mutant PRC2 complexes were tested against
9 a panel of peptidic substrates that represent all possible lysine (K) residues of histone H3 and
  histone H4 (see Example 2 above). All of the enzyme forms showed significant activity only

  against peptides containing the equivalent of residue H3-K27. The specific activity of the
  mutants, however, was greatly reduced relative to WT in the order WT >> Y641F > Y641S ~
  Y641H > Y641N, again consistent with previous reported findings.
  Example 5 - Enzymology
           To understand further the enzymatic activity of these mutants, and to reconcile the
  apparent discrepancy between activity against peptidic and nucleosome substrates, the ability of
  the enzyme forms to catalyze further methylation of various H3-K27 methylation states in the
  context of the H3:21-44 peptide was studied. As stated above, it was found that all of the mutant
  enzymes were deficient catalysts of unmodified H3-K27 peptide methylation, relative to the WT
  enzyme. Remarkably, however, all of the mutant enzymes were found to be superior to WT
  enzyme in catalyzing further methylation of the mono- and especially the di-methylated H3-K27
  peptides (Figure 2). Thus, the data suggest that the WT enzyme is most efficient in catalyzing
  the zero- to mono-methylation reaction. The mutant enzymes are defective in catalyzing this
  initial step, but are more efficient than the WT enzyme in catalyzing the subsequent steps leading
  from mono-methyl to di- and tri-methyl H3-K27.
           The origins of the differential substrate specificities of WT and mutant EZH2 were
  explored through steady state enzyme kinetics. As summarized in Table 2, the mutations have
  minimal effects on ground-state substrate recognition, as demonstrated by the similar values of
  Km for nucleosome and of K 1/2 for peptide substrates. In all cases the peptidic substrates
  displayed sigmoidal binding behavior; hence the concentration of peptide resulting in half
  maximal velocity is reported here as K 1/ 2 instead of the more common Michaelis constant, Km.
  Copeland (2005) Evaluation of Enzyme Inhibitors in Drug Discovery: A Guide to Medicinal
  Chemists and Pharmacologists,Wiley. The SAM Km likewise displayed minimal variation
  among the enzyme forms, ranging from 208  50 to 304  64 nM. Instead, the differences in
5 substrate utilization appear to have their origin in transition state recognition, as demonstrated by
  differences in kcat values among the enzymes for various substrates (Table 2). As a result, the
  catalytic efficiency, quantified as the ratio kcat/K (where K is either Km or K 1/2 , depending on
  substrate identity; vide supra), varies between the WT and mutant enzymes for different states of
  H3-K27 methylation (Table 2).

           The steady state kinetic parameters listed in Table 2 made it possible to calculate the
  expected levels of different H3-K27 methylation states for cells heterozygous for the various
  mutant EZH2 forms, relative to cells homozygous for the WT enzyme. To perform these
9 simulations, a number of simplifying assumptions were made: (1) that steady state enzyme
  kinetics are relevant to PRC2-catalyzed H3-K27 methylation in the cellular context and that all
  measurements are made at the same time point in cell growth; (2) that the mutant and WT
  enzyme are expressed at equal levels in heterozygous cells and that the total EZH2 level is equal
  in all cells; (3) that the cellular concentration of SAM, relative to its Km is saturating and does

        WO 2013/138361                                                         PCT/US2013/030565
  not change among the cells; (4) that the cellular concentration of nucleosome, is similar to its Km
  and likewise does not change among cells; (5) that EZH1 catalyzed methylation of H3-K27 was
  insignificant and constant among the cells; and (6) that any H3-K27 demethylase activity was
  also constant among the cells.
           With these assumptions in place, the predictions illustrated in Figure 3A were obtained
  for relative levels of H3-K27me3 (top panel), H3-K27me2 (middle panel) and H3-K27mel
  (bottom panel). A clear pattern emerges from these simulations. The level of H3-K27me3
  increases relative to WT cells for all mutant-harboring cells, ranging from a 30% increase for the
  Y641H mutant to > 400% for the Y641N mutant. At the same time, the levels of H3-K27me2
  decreases to < 50% of WT for all of the mutants, and the levels of H3-K27mel are reduced by
  approximately half for all mutants, relative to WT.
           The relative levels of the H3-K27 methylation states in B-cell lymphoma cell lines that
  are known to be homozygous for WT EZH2 (OCI-LY 19) or heterozygous for EZH2 Y641N
  (DB, KARPAS 422, and SU-DHL-6) or EZH2 Y641F (WSU-DLCL2) were then measured by
  Western blotting (Figure 3B). The pattern of relative H3-K27 methylation states seen in Figure
  3b is in excellent agreement with the results of the simulations based on in vitro steady state
  kinetic parameters, despite the assumptions used in the simulations and the use of a non
  physiological peptide surrogate as substrate.
           Thus, increased H3-K27me3 was observed for all Y641 mutant-harboring cells relative to
  WT, decreased H3-K27me2 was observed for all Y641 mutant-harboring cells relative to WT,
  and decreased H3-K27mel was observed for at least two of the four mutant cell lines. The near
  comparable levels of H3-K27mel in WT and KARPAS 422 and SU-DHL-6 cells may reflect
  different expression levels of WT and mutant EZH2, different contributions of EZH1, or other
  factors not accounted for in the simulations. Nevertheless, the concordance between the
5 predicted and experimental patterns of H3-K27 methylation status is remarkable and supports the
  view that enzymatic coupling between WT and mutant EZH2 leads to increased H3-K27me3,
  thus resulting in the malignant phenotype of cells that are heterozygous for these mutants.

  Example 11 - H3-K27me2/me3 ratios predict sensitivity to an EZH2 inhibitor
           Tumor cell lines heterozygous for the EZH2 (Y641) mutation display increased levels of
  H3-K27me3, the methylation state of H3-K27 thought to be important in tumorigenesis. Levels
  of the mono (H3-K27me 1), di (H3-K27me2), or trimethylated (H3-K27me3) forms of H3-K27 in
  a panel of cell lines that were WT for EZH2, or heterozygous for EZH2 (Y641) mutations were
  evaluated. Cell lines used are listed in Table 5. The majority of lines are B-cell lymphoma lines,
  however two melanoma lines were also included. IGRI is a melanoma line that has recently been
  found to contain a Y641N mutation in EZH2, and A375 cells were included as a WT EZH2
  melanoma control line. Figures 9A and B show the results of western blot analysis of histones
  isolated from this cell line panel probed with antibodies recognizing H3-K27mel, H3-K27me2,
  or H3-K27me3. In general, global H3-K27me3 levels are higher in Y641 mutant containing cell
  lines than in cell lines expressing WT EZH2 exclusively. The exception is Farage cells, where
  H3-K27me3 levels were similar to those in WT lines. More striking are the dramatically lower
  levels of H3-K27me2 in EZH2 Y641 mutant cell lines relative to wild type cell lines. Little or no
9 H3-K27me2 signal was observed in western blot of histones extracted from Y641 mutant cell
  lines, whereas the signal observed with the same antibody in WT cell lines was more intense
  than that observed with the antibody specific for H3-K27me3. Overall, in WT cell lines the
  western blot signal with an HK27me2 antibody was higher than the signal observed with the H3
  K27me3 antibody, whereas the opposite was true in Y641 mutant cell lines. Thus the ratio of H3
5 K27me3/me2 signal in Y641 lines is higher than that observed in WT lines.
           The H3-K27 methylation state can also be examined by Mass spectrometry (MS), an
  independent method that does not rely on antibody reagents. The MS analysis demonstrated that
                                                    147

     WO 2013/138361                                                         PCT/US2013/030565
H3-K27me3 levels are higher in Y641 mutant and Pfeiffer lines (A677G) than in the other WT
lines, whereas the opposite is true for H3-K27me2 levels. In the Y641 mutant and Pfeiffer lines
(A677G), H3-K27me3 levels were higher than H3-K27me2 levels, whereas the opposite was true
in the other WT lines. These results are consistent with those observed by western blot analysis
in Figure 9A and B.
        The differences in H3-K27 methylation state was also detected by immunocytochemistry
using antibodies to H3-K27me2 or H3-K27me3. This immunohistochemistry assay is used for
detecting aberrant H3-K27me2/3 ratios associated with Y641 mutant EZH2 in formalin fixed
paraffin embedded patient tumor tissue samples. A panel of five WT and five Y641 mutant
lymphoma cell line pellets were fixed and embedded in paraffin blocks and stained with anti-H3
K27me2 or H3-K27me3 antibodies. An antibody to histone H3 was included as a positive
control, since all cells should contain nuclear histone H3. Figure 10 shows that all cell lines were
positive in 100% of cells for both H3-K27me3 and H3 staining. Under these conditions, no clear
difference in H3-K27me3 staining intensity was observed between WT and Y641 mutant cell
lines. This may reflect the limited dynamic range of chromogenic immunocytochemistry staining
compared to other methods of detection. However, as shown in Figure 11, cell lines could be
clearly segregated into those staining positive or negative for H3-K27me2. All WT cell lines
stained positive for H3-K27me2, whereas all Y641 mutant cell lines and Pfeiffer cells (A677G)
showed no staining with the H3-K27me2 antibody. These results are consistent with those
obtained by western and MS analysis.
        Without wishing to be bound by theory, the increased levels of H3-K27me3 associated
with the gain of function EZH2 (Y641) mutations may render cells bearing EZH2 mutations
more sensitive to small molecule EZH2 inhibitors. To evaluate whether the increased H3
K27me3 and/or decreased H3-K27me2 levels observed in Pfeiffer cells in the absence of an
EZH2 Y641 mutation would also correlate with sensitivity to EZH2 inhibitors, two compounds
that demonstrate potent inhibition of EZH2 in biochemical assays with IC50s of 85 and 16 nM
respectively were tested. Treatment of WSU-DLCL2 cells with either compound led to inhibition
of global H3-K27me3 levels, confirming their ability to enter cells and inhibit cellular EZH2
methyltransferase activity (Figure 12).

         The sensitivity of a panel of WT and Y641 mutant cell lines to each compound was
evaluated in proliferation assays. Because the anti-proliferative activity of EZH2 inhibitors takes
several days to manifest, compounds were assessed in 11-day proliferation assays. Figure 13
shows representative growth curves for WT (OCI-LY19), or Y641 mutant (WSU-DLCL2) cell
lines treated with the test compounds. Both compounds demonstrated anti-proliferative activity
against WSU-DLCL2 cells, but little activity against OCI-LY19 cells. Inhibitor A was a more
potent inhibitor of WSU-DLCL2 proliferation than Inhibitor B and this is consistent with
Inhibitor A being a more potent inhibitor of EZH2 in biochemical assays. Proliferation assays
were performed in a panel of WT and Y641 mutant lymphoma cell lines, with Inhibitor B, and
day 11 IC90 values were derived. Figure 14A shows IC90 values of lymphoma cell lines
grouped by EZH2 Y641 status. Overall, Y641 mutant cell lines demonstrated increased
sensitivity to EZH2 inhibitors relative to WT cell lines, although RL and SUDHL4 cells were
significantly less sensitive than other mutant lines. Pfeiffer cells (A677G) demonstrate high H3
K27me3 and low H3-K27me2 levels, and so grouping cell lines according to high H3-K27me3
and low H3-K27me2 gives better discrimination of EZH2 inhibitor sensitivity as shown for
Inhibitor B in Figure 14B.      Thus, high H3-K27me3 and low H3-K27me2 levels can be used to
predict sensitivity to EZH2 inhibitors, independent of knowledge of mutational status.
         These results demonstrates that identifying EZH2 Y641 mutations in patient tumors
and/or detecting low levels of H3-K27me2 relative to H3-K27me3 through use of techniques
such as western blot, MS or IHC in a patient can be used to identify which patient will respond to
EZH2 inhibitor treatment.

  tag on the EED was used to purify active PRC2 complex from cell lysates. The purity of the final
  PRC2 preparations was assessed by SDS-PAGE with Coomassie blue staining and protein
  concentration was determined using a bovine serum albumin standard curve in a Bradford assay.

  PRC2 in assay buffer (20 mM BICINE, 1 mM DTT, 0.002% Tween 20, 0.005% bovine skin
  gelatin (BSG), pH 7.6). Reactions were allowed to proceed for the indicated time interval and
  then quenched by addition of excess cold SAM (100 p M final concentration). Quenched reaction
  mixtures were transferred to a streptavidin-coated Flashplate (Perkin Elmer, catalog number
  SMP410), and allowed to bind for one hour before the plates were washed in a Biotek EL-405x
  platewasher and read on a TopCount NXT HTS scintillation and luminescence counter
  (PerkinElmer).
  Example 14 - Enzymology
           Recombinant 4-component PRC2 complexes were prepared with wild-type and either
  A677G or A687V mutant versions of EZH2 (see Example 12 above; Cao et al. (2004) Mol Cell
  15:57-67). Each complex was initially tested for the ability to catalyze 3H-methyl transfer from
  labeled S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) to each of the four H3:21-44 peptides. Enzyme was
  serially diluted, and a mixture of peptide (200 nM) and SAM (200 nM 3 H-SAM and 800 nM
  unlabeled SAM) was added. Reactions were quenched at 15 minute intervals by the addition of
  an excess of unlabeled SAM and reaction velocity was calculated based on the linear regression
  of raw counts per minute (CPM) vs. time. As shown in Figure 15, the mutant enzymes displayed
  a different pattern of activity than the wild-type enzyme. The A677G and A687V mutants had
  robust activity on all of the unmethylated, monomethylated and dimethylated H3:21-44 peptides,
  whereas the wild-type enzyme only showed robust activity on the unmethylated and
  monomethylated peptides. The control peptide, containing fully trimethylated H3-K27 was not
  methylated in the assay, indicating that H3-K27 was the target lysine.
  Example 15 - Enzymology
           To further understand the enzymatic activity of these mutants, the origins of the
  differential substrate specificities of wild-type and mutant EZH2 were explored through steady
5 state enzyme kinetics. Reactions containing a titration of the H3-K27 peptides with fixed
  enzyme (4 nM) and SAM (200 nM          3H-SAM    and 800 nM unlabeled SAM) were performed. In
  all cases the peptidic substrates displayed sigmoidal binding behavior; hence the concentration of
  peptide resulting in half-maximal velocity is reported here as K1 2 instead of the more common
  Michaelis-Menten constant, Km (Copeland (2005) Evaluation of Enzyme Inhibitors in Drug
  Discovery: A Guide to Medicinal Chemists and Pharmacologists,Wiley). As summarized in
                                                     151

  Table 6, the mutations have an effect on ground-state substrate recognition as demonstrated by
  lower K 1 /2 for the unmethylated peptide substrates and higher K1 / 2 values for the dimethylated
  peptide substrates. Additionally, the maximal velocities of the enzymes are affected by the
  mutations. The A677G mutation leads to 2.9-, 3.7- and 22-fold increases in kcat on respective un
  , mono-, and dimethyl H3-K27 peptide susbtrates, while the A687V mutation results in a 3-fold
  reduction in kcat on the unmethyl H3-K27 peptide, but produces respective 3.5- and 2.5-fold
  increases in kcat on the mono- and dimethyl H3-K27 peptides. The SAM Km displayed minimal
  variation among the enzyme forms, 403  64 nM to 899  89 nM on the substrate containing the
  preferred methylation state at the H3-K27 residue.

          The Pfeiffer cell line, containing the heterozygous EZH2 mutation A677G, is shown to
  be sensitive to EZH2 inhibition by a small molecule inhibitor Compound #7. Proliferation
  inhibition is seen as early as 96hr post-inhibitor treatment. The proliferation IC50 after 11 days

  contain the Y641F heterozygous mutation, and have an IC50 of 270nM or OCI-Lyl9 cells, which
  are WT for EZH2, and have an IC50 of 3000nM. These results show that in a cellular context,
