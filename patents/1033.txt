A mould 3.020 has a heating layer 3.022 formed on at least a portion of its cavity surface. The
heating element is a resistive layer 4.030, preferably formed using nanotechnology techniques. An
insulating layer 5.036 isolates the resistive layer from the mould surface. Electrodes 4.032, 4.034 are
provided for establishing electrical connexion with an electrical power source. This device enables
more precise control of heating of the mould charge than the bulk heating of the mould.

 A Mould or.Mould Core and a Method of Manufacturing a Mould or Mould Core
Field of the invention
[001]   This invention relates to a mould construction and a method of using a mould.
[002]   The invention is particularly suited for moulding processes where heat must
be added to the mould charge when it is inside the mould cavity. The invention will be
described in the context of an injection moulding process. The invention can be
adapted for use with thermosetting materials such as silicone and for use with
thermal cross-linking of materials, such as plastics.
Background of the invention
[003]             When injection moulding using material such as silicone in liquid
silicone injection moulding, the mould charge can be in a liquid form, and is heated
and cured in the mould. The current practice of heating a mould charge inside a
mould is to heat the mould to a predetermined temperature before injecting the
mould charge into the mould. This uses a substantially greater amount of heat than is
required to heat the mould charge. In addition, the cycle time is increased due to the
time required to heat or reheat the mould to the predetermined temperature. The rate
of heating or cooling the mould charge can affect the quality of the product.
[004]            Mould cavities can have non-planar surfaces.
Summary of the invention
[005]            In this specification, the term "thermal element" refers to a coating,
layer, or plural layer arrangement which is capable of acting as an active heat source
or a heat sink or both. That is, the thermal element can generate heat or absorb heat.
[006]            According to an embodiment of the invention, there is provided a
mould or a mould core having a thermal element applied to a substrate, the substrate
including at least a part of the surface of the mould or core or both.
[007]            The thermal coating can include at least one heating element applied
to a substrate, the substrate including at least part of the surface of the mould cavity
or mould core or both.
[008]            The heating element can be a thin film layer.
[009]            The heating element can be electrically insulated from the substrate.

                                             2
[010]           A thermal insulation layer can be provided between the heating
element and, the substrate.

layer.

conductive layer.
[014]           The cooling fluid can be a liquid.
[015]           The cooling fluid can be a gas.
[016]           The cooling system can be turned on after the mould charge has been
thermally set or cross-linked.
[017]           The mould can include a pair of electrodes connected to the or each
heating element.
[018]           The heating element can have at least one portion which is thicker
than another portion of the heating element.
[019]           The mould can include two or more electrically separate heating
elements.
[020]           The mould can include a second electrical insulation layer formed on
the top of the heating element.
[021]           The thermal element can be a Peltier device.
[022]           The Peltier device can be a multi-layer device.
[023]           The invention also provides a method of forming an electrical heating
element on at least a portion of the surface of a mould cavity, including the steps of:
depositing a first insulation layer on the said at least a portion of the mould surface,
and
depositing an electrically resistive layer on the first insulation layer.
[024]           The method can include the step of forming a second insulation layer
on the electrically resistive layer.
[025]           A thermal insulation layer can be provided between the resistive layer
and the substrate.

[026]            The method can include the step of forming a pair of electrodes on the
or each electrically conducting layer.
[027]           The method can include forming two or more separate electrically
isolated heating elements.
[028]           The method can include forming at least one region of greater
thickness in at least one heating element.
[029]           A source of heating energy can be connected to the heating element.
[030]           The source of energy can be an electrical energy supply.
[031]           At least one of the layers can be applied by the sol-gel process.
[032]           The layers can be applied by spray pyrolysis.
[033]           The mould can include cooling fluid ducts.

the mould charge prior to injecting the mould charge;
and
turning the surface heaters off when the mould charge has been injected.
[035]           The method can also include the step of cooling the mould body via
cooling fluid in cooling ducts in the mould.

Detailed description of the embodiment or embodiments
[051]             The invention will be described with reference to the embodiments
illustrated in the drawings.
[052]             To reduce the complexity of the drawings and better illustrate the
inventive concepts, the conventional operating elements of the moulding system,
which are familiar to the person skilled in the technology, such as, eg, the injection
valves, are not shown in the schematic illustrations.
[053]             Figure 1 represents a moulded product 1.002 produced by a mould
made according to an embodiment of the invention. The product is made from
silicone and has an upper portion in the form of a first cylinder 1.004 and a lower
portion in the form of a second cylinder 1.006 coaxial with the first cylinder, but of
larger radius.

WO 2011/035376                                                           PCT/AU2010/001244
                                             5
 [054]           Figure 2 schematically illustrates a first mould portion adapted to form
the upper cylinder portion 1.004 of the product 1.002. The mould has a cylindrical
 cavity defined by cylindrical wall 2.016 and closed at the top 2.012. A rim 2.014
 projects transversely to the wall 2.016.
 [055]           Figure 3 represents the mating mould portion 3.020 adapted to
combine with the mould portion of Figure 2 when moulding the product 1.002. A
second cylindrical cavity is formed by cylindrical wall 3.026 closed at the base and
having a transversely projecting rim 3.024. The projecting rims 2.014 and 3.024 are
brought together under closing force during the moulding process and define the join
line between the two mould halves.
[056]           A heating element 3.022 is formed on the base of the second cylinder.
[057]           The mould halves can be made of the conventional materials, such as
steel or aluminium.
[058]           The mould halves can also include cooling fluid ducts (not shown).
[059]           As shown in Figure 4, the heating element 4.022 can be formed as a
thin film element including a conductive layer 4.030 formed on an electrically
insulating layer 4.036. A pair of electrodes or buss bars 4.032, 4.034 can be mounted
on opposite sections of the conductive layer 4.030. The layer 4.030 is referred to as a
conductive layer, rather than a resistive layer as, in the preferred embodiment, it is of
relatively low resistivity. However, the term resistive layer could also be used to
describe layer 4.030 as it is a resistive heating element.
[060]           Preferably the insulating layer 4.036 also has good thermal insulation
characteristics.
[061]           The electrodes can be connected to an external source of electrical
power via conductive leads which can pass through the walls of the mould or which
can be fed into the cavity via the rim.
[062]           The electrical power source can be the mains power, such as 240 v,
50 Hz. Alternatively the power supply can be a DC power supply. The power supply
can have a controllable output. The resistance of the conductor layer can be
designed to provide the optimal heat energy input to the mould shot.
[063]           A power regulation arrangement can be provided to ensure that the
input heat energy is as required. Thus, the current and voltage can be monitored to
determine the input power. Alternatively, the resistance of the conductive layer can
be measured or calibrated at intervals and then only one of the voltage or current

WO 2011/035376                                                           PCT/AU2010/001244
                                               6
 needs to be monitored. since the power can be calculated from any two of voltage,
 current and resistance.
 [064]           In a preferred embodiment, the conductive layer 4.030, the insulation
 layer 4.036 and the electrodes 4.032, 4.034 can be formed by nanotechnology
 processes to provide very thin layers.
 [065]           In an alternative embodiment, the electrodes 4.032, 4.034 can be
formed on the insulator layer 4.036, and the conductive layer then formed on top of
the electrodes.
 [066]           A second heating element may optionally be provided in the top 2.012
of the first mould cavity.
 [067]           Figure 5 illustrates a modified version of the heater element
arrangement of Figure 4. The insulator layer 5.036 projects beyond the conductive
 layer 5.030. A second insulator layer 5.040 is applied over the top of the conductor
 layer and electrodes. The insulation layers 5.036, 5.040 project beyond the edges of
the conductive layer.
 [068]           The insulative layer 5.040 can also be designed to provide abrasion
resistance for the underlying layers.
[069]            Preferably the insulation layer 5.040 has high electrical insulation
characteristics and good thermal conduction characteristics.
[070]            In a further embodiment, heating elements can be incorporated in the
join line portions of the mould, such as in rim 3.024 or rim 2.014. This provides the
operator with the option of controlling the setting or cross-linking of the join line
material separately from the mould charge.
[071]            The insulative layers, the conductive layer, and the electrodes can be
formed using nanotechnology processes. Thus the sol-gel process can be used to
form the components. Alternatively, spray pyrolysis can be used to form one or more
of the layers. Other methods of forming the layers can include dip coating, spray
coating, spluttering, chemical deposition, physical deposition, and other methods
suitable for depositing conductive or insulative materials. Preferably the method is
adapted for nano-deposition.
[072]            Very thin layers can thus be made.
[073]            The layers can have a thickness of between 1 micron & 1000 micron.

WO 2011/035376                                                           PCT/AU2010/001244
                                              7
[074]           The composition of the resistive layer can be for example, a mixture of
tin oxide and indium oxide, or an alloy of indium with 9% tin. The layers can be
applied by RF Sputtering, vapour phase deposition, the sol-gel process, etc. The
layer thickness can range from 0.2 pm to over 100 pm. The resistivity can range from
less than 2 f/cm2 to over 40 fl/cm2 . Other compositions can be used. The book
Integrating Electrical heating Elements in Appliance Design, Thor Hegbom, Marcel
Dekker,lnc 1997, at Chapter 7 describes various compositions and methods of
application of thin film heaters.
[075]           The composition of the base insulator can be Teflon.
[076]           During the moulding process, the mould material, eg, silicone, can be
injected cold, eg, at ambient temperature. The heating element can then be switched
on and deliver sufficient heat energy to raise the material to the cure temperature
within a predetermined time. Alternatively, the heating element can be pre-heated.
[077]           In conventional cold injection moulding, the mould body is pre-heated
to a temperature above the cure temperature of the mould charge. Thus, as the
mould charge is injected into the mould, the skin layer will be rapidly raised above the
cure temperature, while the material more distant from the mould wall will be heated
more slowly. Arrangements embodying the present invention can heat the mould
charge more evenly than is achievable using conventional pre-heated moulds.
[078]           It is generally desirable to have a fairly uniform current distribution in
the conductor layer. Figure 6 illustrates schematically an alternative electrode
arrangement in which a central electrode 6.050 forms one side of the resistance
connection, and a pair of peripheral electrodes 6.032, 6.034 can be connected to the
other side of the power supply. A lead 6.042 can be connected to the central
electrode to facilitate connection to the power supply. The lead can be insulated from
the conductor layer by an insulator layer 6.046. This prevents current from the
conductor layer flowing to the lead except via the electrodes 6.032, 6.034, 6.050.
Thus the lead does not interfere with the current distribution in the conductor layer
6.030.
[079]           In a further modification shown in Figure 7, a single annular peripheral
electrode 7.044 and a central disc electrode 7.050 can be connected to respective
sides of the power supply. A lead 7.042 from the central electrode can also be taken
out across the conductor layer and the annular electrode, with an insulation layer
7.046 between the lead and the conductor layer and the annular electrode. A further
insulating layer can be deployed on top of the lead.

WO 2011/035376                                                               PCT/AU2010/001244
                                               8
[080]             In a still further arrangement, a plurality of alternative electrodes can
be formed on or under the conductor layer, with alternative conductors connected to
opposite sides of the power supply.
[081]             However, in some instances it may be desirable to change the current
density in different portions of the conductor layer, and this can also be achieved by
shaping the electrodes to control the current distribution. The principle being that the
closer the portions of the opposite electrodes are spaced, the greater the current in
the intervening portion of the conductor layer. Hence, a uniform thickness conductor
layer can be used in conjunction with profiled electrodes to control the current
distribution within the conductor layer. For example, in the arrangement of Figure 4,
the current density would be least across the diagonal intersecting the centre of the
two electrodes, while the current density would be greatest in the portion of the
conductor layer proximate the ends of the electrodes.
[082]            While the conductor layer, the insulation layers and the electrodes are
shown as circular, they can be designed in any shape required to fit the mould wall.
The layers can conform to two dimensional or three dimensional surfaces.
[083]            Figure 8 is a hypothetical graph illustrating temperature plotted against
depth and time within a mould. The vertical axis is the temperature axis. The time
axis is angled downwardly, or projecting out of the plane of the page (assuming the
temperature axis to lie in the plane of the page), while the depth axis is angled
upwards, or projecting behind the plane of the page.
[084]            Temperatures of up to 250 0C can be used to cure the silicone.
Silicone can cure at the rate of about 5 sec/mm thickness for a given input
temperature. Temperatures of between 11 0*C to 250 0C can be used.
[085]            Temperature at the mould surface with an input power of P1 is
illustrated by line 8.102, and the surface temperature with input power of P2 is
illustrated by line 8.104. P2 is greater than P1.
[086]            At depth D, the temperature profile for an input power of P1 is
illustrated by line 8.106, and line 8.108 illustrates the temperature profile at depth D
with an input power of P2.
[087]            A plane defined by lines A & B is drawn through the cure temperature
TCURE. A cure locus can be drawn where the temperature profile line at a particular
depth intersects the cure plane. Thus the line 8.110 represents the cure temperature

WO 2011/035376                                                           PCT/AU2010/001244
                                                9
locus with an input power of P1. Similarly, the cure locus at P2 is represented by line
8.112.
[088]            With an input power of P1, the material at the surface takes a time
period t1 to reach the cure temperature. With an input power of P1, the material at
depth D takes t 2 to reach the cure temperature.
[089]            With an input power of P2 , the material at the surface takes a time
period t3 to reach the cure temperature. With an input power of P2, the material at
depth D takes t 4 to reach the cure temperature.
[090]            This graph illustrates the ability of the system according to the
invention to control the cure process. It is also possible, in accordance with the
invention to change the input power during a moulding operation to achieve a desired
cure rate profile.
[091]            In addition, different portions of the mould surface can be heated at
different rates. this can be achieved by having separate conductor layers at different
locations. This can be achieved by depositing separate conductor layers at different
locations with a physical space between the separate layers. Alternatively, a single
layer can be deposited and then dividing lines can be etched out of the conductor
layer to form the separate conductor layers. Separate electrode pairs can be applied
to the separate conductor layer locations so they can be heated at different rates.
[092]            In a further alternative, the thickness of the conductor layer can be
varied at different locations. This may be done, for example, by deposition a first
conductor layer over the entire surface to be heated, and then selectively depositing
further layer or layers at specified locations to increase the thickness of the layer at
the specified locations. The resistivity of the layer varies inversely in relation to the
thickness of the layer. The thicker layers will carry additional current compared with
the adjacent non-thickened layer portions.
[093]            The heating element can be applied to a planar surface, a convex
surface, or a concave surface. The heating element can be applied to either a mould
core or mould cavity, or both.
[094]            Figure 9 schematically illustrates a Peltier device according to an
embodiment of the invention. A Peltier device operates on the basis that a junction
between a pair of certain dissimilar materials such as metals will heat up if a current
passes through the junction in one direction, and will cool if the current is reversed.
The device illustrated by way of example in Figure 9 has a first metal layer 9.062 and

a second metal layer 9.066. Links such as 9.064 of the first metal contact the second
metal layer at junction 9.076, and links 9.078 of the second metal contact the first
layer at junction 9.078 The links are separated by insulation 9.070 in the interstices
between the links.
[095]             Electrode 9.061 and 9.063 form part of the electrical supply path
delivering current to the device. Arrows 9.072 and 9.074 indicate a current flow in a
first direction. This current flow causes the junction 9.076 to cool, and junction 9.074
to heat.
[096]            The layers 9.062 and 9.066 can cover a substantial portion of the
surface of the substrate.
[097]             Figure 10 illustrates the device of Figure 9 operating in the reverse
mode to that shown in Figure 9. When the current flow is reversed, junction 10.076
becomes hot and junction 10.078 cools. Thus, it is possible to use a Peltier
arrangement to deliver cering heat and then to cool the mould charge.
[098]            Figure 11 illustrates a further Peltier arrangement. In this arrangement,
the dissimilar metals 11.084, 11.086 are laid out in parallel lines with a common
interface which forms the Peltier junction. A second Peltier junction is formed by the
strips 11.090, 11.092. The strips 11.086, 11.092 are joined by an isthmus 11.096 of
the same material. Electrodes 11.080, 11.082 deliver the electrical current to the
strips 11.084, 11.090 respectively. Insulator strips 11.088 can be provided so that a
number of such Peltier devices can be assembled in parallel.
[099]            The temperature differential provided by a Peltier couple is of the
order of 70 0 C in the unloaded state, and less when the device is transferring heat
energy. thus, a stack of several Peltier devices need to be used to deliver a
temperature of the order of 300*C under thermal load conditions. Figure 12 illustrates
a multi-layer Peltier arrangement. Second metal layers 12.066, 12.069 are
sandwiched between first metal layers 12.062, 12.067, 12.071. Electrodes 12.063,
12.061 deliver current to the upper and lower layers 12.062, 12.071 respectively.
[0100]           Figure 13 shown an alternative arrangement according to an
embodiment of the invention. A resistive layer 13.030 has a pair of electrodes
attached to opposed edges. An electrical insulation layer 13.054 is located between
the resistive layer 13.030 and a thermally conductive layer 13.052. The thermally
conductive layer may be a metal with good thermal conductivity, or it may be made
from carbon nanotubes or other suitable material. A cooling fluid duct 13.056 can be
provided in thermal conductive contact with the thermal conductive layer 13.052.

[0101]            In operation, the mould can be preheated before ht e mould charge is
injected into.the mould, and the mould charge can be heated by the resistive layer
 13.054. During the curing phase, no cooling fluid id pumped through the duct 13.056.
When the charge has cured, cooling fluid can be pumped through the duct 13.056.
The timing of the curing process will be determined by the amount of heat energy
delivered through the resistive layer
[0102]            An electrical power supply shown schematically as battery 12.202 in
Figure 12 , with power control means (switch 12.202) are connected to the
electrodes. A controller or processor 12.200 can be programmed to control the heat
energy input based on the depth of the cavity, and the cure or cross-link rate of the
charge. Metering equipment, such as ammeter 12.206 and voltmeter 12.208 can
provide control signals to the controller 12.200.
[0103]            In the current process of moulding plastics, the mould charge is
injected hot, and the heat is drawn off via the mass of the mould body. cooling ducts
can be provided in the mould body so cooling fluid can be circulated to cool thee
mould body. However, in order to ensure that the plastics mould charge flows
correctly during the injection phase, it is current practice to heat the mould to above
120*C. Thus a significant amount of time is required to cool the mould body
sufficiently for the plastics to set before opening the mould. Thus the invention
provides a method of moulding plastics in which the mould body does not need to be
pre-heated. The mould body is maintained at a low temperature, and the surface
heaters are turned on slightly before the mould charge is injected so the surface is at
a sufficient temperature to prevent setting of the mould charge while the mould
charge is being injected. When the mould charge has been injected, the surface
heaters are turned off and the cooling process commences with the heat of the
mould charge being drawn out through the body of the mould. Again, cooling ducts
can be provided in the body to assist in cooling. Also, if a Peltier arrangement is
used, this can be run to cool the thermal element. In this arrangement, the sprue
through which the plastics charge is delivered to the mould can also be heated to
ensure a smooth flow of the plastics material.
