Description
             GANG MOWER WITH REEL MOWER CUTTING UNITS
Technical field
[0001] The invention relates to a mower comprising a large number of cutting units
       with rollers. The invention also relates to a process for folding a mower.
Background of the invention
[0002] In order to increase its mowing capacity, a lawn mower is provided with a
       plurality of cutting units. These cutting units are positioned side by side in
       order to provide the broadest width of work as possible. Each cutting unit
       comprises rotating blades, a casing in order to stop projectiles thrown by
       the blades, wheels engaging the ground and eventually an engine to rotate
       the blades. With all these components, each cutting unit is heavy, and a
       plurality of heavy cutting units represents an important load.
[0003] Gang mowers generally comprise a frame that extends laterally in order to
       connect the cutting units. The cutting units are mounted on the frame and
       are articulated between a cutting position and a rest position. Thus, the
       frame has to bear the weight of cutting units when they are in the rest
       position. In mowing position, the frame also has to withstand shocks due to
       unevenness of the ground, or due to curt manoeuvers, or eventually the
       presence of blocks on the grass forming a hurdle.
[0004] The broader the frame is, the higher the frame is strained. For this reason,
       when the mower comprises a plurality of cutting units, for instance more
       than ten, the frame needs to be peculiarly resistant. This need of resistance
       implies to conceive a heavy frame. The frame is mounted on wheels that
       are configured to bear the weight of the mower, including the weight of the
       frame, and of cutting units.
[0005] The document US 5,076,044 A discloses a mowing device with a frame and
       a plurality of cutting units. Each cutting unit is linked to the frame by means
       of chains and lift means. The frame shows an elongated shape and may be
       pulled by a tractor. The frame is configured in order to be disposed
       transversally to the drive direction of the tractor. The frame relies on a
       plurality of pairs of wheels who are distributed along the frame. The wheels

                                            2
       engage the ground and bear the weight of the frame. However, these
       wheels may damage the grass due to their number and to the weight they
       support. In particular, turf rollers production requires mowing frequently the
       grass sprout even when they are young and consequently weak. The
       frequency of passages of the wheels will damage the grass culture and
       reduce the quality of turf rollers. Damages may be more important when the
       mower follows curves or turns sharply. For instance, wheels may create
       some notches on the turf. When the mower turns, the wheels exert shear
       strains at their interface with the turf. These strains damage the crop.
[0006] Document US 5,220,773 discloses a mower for mowing a wide swath. The
       mower includes side-by-side wings to which a plurality of cutting units are
       mounted, the most distal unit being mounted on a horizontally pivoting
       swing-arm, which is mounted to a horizontally pivoting strut. The strut is
       pivotably mounted on the front of a frame of the mower and under control of
       a hydraulic cylinder to facilitate mowing operations, and in particular, to
       allow mowing close to obstacles. This mower shows however some
       limitations in the weight and length of the struts, essentially in that the frame
       might become unstable when operating long and heavy struts carrying the
       cutting units.
Summary of the invention
Technical problem
[0007] The object of the invention is to propose a solution to at least one of the
       aforementioned problems, more particularly to provide a large mowing
       capacity while reducing the risk of damaging a turf with a mower.

       transversally in the mowing configuration; preferably the cutting units are in
       majority linked to the at least one beam, eventually in the mowing
       configuration the beams are mounted in a cantilever fashion.
[0017] According to an advantageous embodiment of the invention, each beam is
       pivotally mounted on the frame as to be foldable to a position along a
       longitudinal axis of said frame, preferably in a forward direction and/or an
       inward direction.

                                           4
[0018] According to an advantageous embodiment of the invention, each beam
       comprises a lateral portion and a central portion which are aligned in the
       mowing configuration; preferably in the transport configuration the lateral
       portion of each beam is folded back over the top of the corresponding
       central portion.
[0019] According to an advantageous embodiment of the invention, the frame
       comprises a longitudinal portion that mainly extends longitudinally and
       shows a front end and a rear end, preferably the cutting units are linked to
       the frame through the rear half of the elongated portion, more preferably the
       cutting units are linked to the frame through the rear end of the elongated

[0020] According to an advantageous embodiment of the invention, in the mowing
       configuration the cutting units are generally longitudinally distributed along
       the longitudinal portion, preferably the cutting units are longitudinally
       distributed on more than the length of the longitudinal portion, eventually at
       least one cutting unit is linked to the longitudinal portion of the frame.
[0021] According to an advantageous embodiment of the invention, the mower
       comprises a set of wheels pivotally fixed to the frame, preferably the mower
       is elongated, the wheels being fixed to the frame in the vicinity of the rear
       end of the frame.
[0022] According to an advantageous embodiment of the invention, in the transport
       configuration, the majority of the cutting units are above the wheels of the
       mower, preferably the frame comprises an axle joining the wheel to the
       frame, the cutting units are generally transversally above the axle.
[0023] According to an advantageous embodiment of the invention, the frame

       of the rollers is superior to 4,00 cm, preferably superior to 6,00 cm, more
       preferably superior to 9,00 cm.
[0027] This feature increases the contact area between each roller and the ground,
       and then decreases the strain applied by each roller on the ground. Hence,
       grass sprouts will be less crushed by the passage of a roller, which is an
       important point since rollers are supposed to bear the weight of the frame.

       generally rigid, preferably the frame can show elastic deformations of one
       of its extremities in respect of the other extremities of less than 5 cm,
       preferably less than 3 cm, more preferably less than 1 cm. Higher
       deformations are plastic deformations.
[0034] According to an advantageous embodiment of the invention, the beams
       comprise locking means for preventing them to pivot relatively to each other.
[0035] According to an advantageous embodiment of the invention, the mower
       comprises an axle joining the wheels to the frame.

                                          6

       the mower are disposed in a transversally central position.
[0043] According to an advantageous embodiment of the invention, in majority, the
       cutting units are longitudinally regularly spaced along the frame.
[0044] According to an advantageous embodiment of the invention, the disposition
       of the cutting units generally shows symmetry according to a longitudinal
       and vertical plan.
[0045] According to an advantageous embodiment of the invention, the cutting
       units are disposed side by side transversally.
[0046] According to an advantageous embodiment of the invention, in the transport
       configuration the beams are placed above the wheels.
[0047] According to an advantageous embodiment of the invention, in the transport
       configuration the cutting units are in the non-mowing position in respect with
       the frame.
[0048] The invention also relates to a process for folding a mower according to the

        operation of lifting the central portions and the lateral portions, and a third
        operation of pivoting forwardly the lateral portions and the central portions.
[0049] According to an advantageous embodiment of the invention, in the second
        operation the cutting units of the lateral portions are lifted above the wheels.
[0050] According to an advantageous embodiment of the invention, the third
        operation and the first operation may be inverted, then the operation of lifting
        the cutting unit of the first operation becomes optional.
[0051] In one aspect, the invention resides in a mower comprising
       a frame,
       two beams pivotally mounted on the frame so as to be foldable from a "V"
       mowing configuration to a position along a longitudinal axis of the frame,
       at least eight cutting units generally disposed side by side,
       means linking the cutting units to the beams,
      wherein the frame forms the structure of a trailer comprising a longitudinal
      elongate portion with a front end and a rear end, the beams being pivotably
      mounted to the rear end.
[0052] Preferably, the means linking the cutting units to the beams are lift means
        configured for moving the cutting units between a mowing position to a non
        mowing position.
[0053] Preferably, the cutting units are reel mowing cutting units with a set of
        helicoidally blades.
[0054] Preferably, the lift means link independently each cutting unit to the beams.
[0055] Preferably, the lift means comprise at least one crank linked to one of the
        beams and to one of the cutting units.
[0056] Preferably, the lift means comprise a plurality of actuators, each of which
        being linked to one of the beams and directly or indirectly to one of the
        cutting units.
[0057] Preferably, the majority of the cutting units are disposed in order to
        transversally overlap their closest neighbor.
[0058] Preferably, each of the beams comprises a lateral portion and a central
        portion which are aligned in the mowing configuration; and in the transport
        configuration the lateral portion of each beam is folded back over the top of
        the corresponding central portion.

                                            8
[0059] Preferably, said mower comprises a set of wheels rotatably mounted on the
        frame in the vicinity of the rear end of the frame.
[0060] Preferably, the frame comprises a hub to which the beams are linked, and
        a raise mechanism for lifting the hub from the mowing configuration to the
        transport configuration.
[0061] Preferably, at least one of the cutting units is linked to the raise mechanism
        and/or at least one of the cutting units is linked to the hub.
Advantages of the invention
[0062] The invention permits, in the mowing configuration, to transfer part of the
        weight of the frame of the mower to the rollers of the cutting units instead of
        to the wheels. When the mower is implemented on a tractor, it permits to
        transfer part of the tractor's weight on the rollers.
[0063] The invention affords to reduce the number and/or the size of the wheels of
        the mower, since in the mowing configuration the frame's weight is
        supported by rollers instead of these wheels. The invention permits to
        reduce the width of the wheels which reduces the shear strains generated
        by the wheels when the mower turns.
[0064] During mowing operation mown grass is projected and forms blocks on rear
        cuttings units. These blocks may fall from cutting units and reduces the
        quality of turf. The "V" configuration of the cutting units reduces the block
        formation since a front cutting unit is just ahead of a single cutting unit
        instead of two.
[0065] The invention provides a smart solution for engineering a wide gang mower
        that becomes thin in the transport configuration. The invention also reduces
        the overall length of the mower in the transport configuration.

Description of embodiments
[0073] In the coming description the orientation used corresponds to the orientation
       shown by the cutting unit shows in mowing configuration. The mower is
       considered to stand on a flat ground.
[0074] The figure 1 illustrates a mower 2 according to the invention. The mower 2
       is seen in an aerial view. The mower may be a vehicle. The mower may be
       a trailer. The mower may be pulled by a tractor 4, or may eventually be an
       implement mounted on the frame of a tractor, the implement being carried
       by the tractor's wheels.
[0075] The mower 2 comprises at least six cutting units 6, preferably at least
       eighteen cutting units 6. The cutting units 6 are generally arranged side by
       side. They generally form alignments. They are generally arranged on two
       main axes that form a kind of letter "V". Some cutting units may be placed
       outside the alignments.
[0076] The mower comprises a frame 8. The frame 8 comprises at least one beam
       10, preferably two beams 10. The beams 10 principally extend transversally.
       They also extend longitudinally, preferably forward. The beams 10 may
       extend longitudinally in opposite directions, and longitudinally in the same
       direction. They are tilted regarding a transversal axis 11. Each beam 10
       forms an angle a with the transversal axis 11 that is comprised between 50
       and 60", preferably comprised between 150 and 500, more preferably
       comprised between 300 and 40'. The cutting units 6 are linked to the beams
       10. Some cutting units 6 may be settled longitudinally at the level of the

                                            10
       tractor 4. This feature increases the maneuverability of the mower 2 and the
       tractor. It also permits to settle forward the center of gravity of the mower.
[0077] The frame comprises a longitudinal portion 12. The longitudinal portion 12
       is elongated. The longitudinal portion 12 length is superior to three times the
       width of a cutting unit, preferably five times. The longitudinal portion 12 is
       transversally placed in a central position. It extends on the majority of the
       mower's length. The mower 2 also comprises wheels 14. It may comprise
       wheels 14 linked to the rear half of the longitudinal portion 12, preferably
       linked at the rear extremity of the elongated portion. Preferably, the gravity
       centers of the beams 10 are before the wheels 14.
[0078] The mower 2 may comprise a hub 16 that connects the beams to the
       longitudinal portion 12. The mower 2 may comprise lift means for lifting the
       beams from a mowing configuration to a transport configuration.
[0079] The hub 16 can support cutting unit(s) 6 disposed centrally as to cover at
       the least the width of the frame 12, or at least the width of the frame 12 and
       the wheels 14. This or these cutting units can be arranged at the rear of the
       hub 16.
[0080] The mower is essentially wide, it may extend on more than ten meters. The
       mower is wider than the tractor 4, at least two times preferably four times.
       Hence, it needs to be foldable in order to reduce its width and to respect
       road regulation in matter of width of a vehicle. The following figures depict
       the steps for folding the mower in a transport configuration.
[0081] The figure 2 is a side view of a first operation for folding the mower's frame.
       The mower 2 is towed by a tractor 4 that is partially represented.
[0082] Each beam 10 comprises a plurality of portion. It preferably comprises a
       central portion 20 and a lateral portion 22 that are aligned. They may be
       linked to each other by pivot means 24 that may show horizontal pivot axes.
       The pivot means 24 may comprise a pivot junction associated with each
       beam 10. Each pivot junction shows a pivot axis that is perpendicular to its
       respective beam 10.
[0083] The pivot means 24 may comprise rotary engines (not represented).
       Alternatively, the pivot means 24 comprises actuators, like hydraulic
       actuators, and are eventually completed by levers.

                                          11
[0084] The first operation consists in retracting the lateral portions 22 of the beams
       10. The lateral portions 22 are folded up. The lateral portions 22 are
       switched from a forward position toward a rearward position.
[0085] During the first operation, each lateral portion 22 is pivoted in respect of his
       respective central portion 20 of substantially a half turn. Each lateral portion
       22 is pivoted of an angle comprised between 1600 and 2000, preferably an
       angle comprised between 170" and 1900, more preferably an angle
       comprised between 1750 and 1850.
[0086] In the meantime, the cutting units 6 are placed in a non-mowing position.
       The non-mowing position may be a rest position. They are away from the
       ground 26. They no longer engage the ground 26. In an alternative
       embodiment of the invention, the cutting units 6 may reach their non
       mowing position before or after the lateral portions are pivoted.
[0087] The figure 3 shows a side view of the mower 2 in a first intermediate step
       during the folding of the frame 8.
[0088] At this moment, the lateral portions 22 are placed back over the top of their
       respective central portions 20. Then, these portions (20, 22) are stacked.
       The portions are still in a "V" configuration. The stacked portions are still
       disposed laterally to the wheels 14. They are at the height of the wheels 14.
       The lateral portions extend along the central portions.
[0089] The figure 4 represents a second operation for folding mower 2 which is
       seen laterally.
[0090] The mower 2 is represented with his longitudinal portion 12, the hub 16 and
       the raise mechanism 18, the beams are not represented. At least one cutting
       unit 6 is linked to the raise mechanism 18 and/or at least one cutting unit 6
       is linked to the hub 16. Preferably, the mower 2 comprises one cutting unit
       linked to the hub 16 transversally in a central position, and two cutting units
       linked also to the hub 16 and transversally disposed laterally to the central
       cutting unit of the raise mechanism. These three cutting units 6 are not
       settled in the general alignment of the cutting units 6 linked to the beams
       10.
[0091] The hub 16 is linked to the longitudinal portion 12 by the raise mechanism.
       For this purpose, the later comprises a set of arms 28 that are pivotally
       linked to the longitudinal portion 12 and to the hub 16. The arms 28 may be

                                           12
       substantially parallel. During the second operation, the arms 28 are pivoted
       upwardly of at least 100, preferably at least 300, more preferably at least
       600.
[0092] The raise mechanism 18 may comprise a lower arm 28 and an upper arm
       28. The upper arm and the lower arm may show a trapezoidal shape or a
       rectangular shape. Each arm 28 presents a width in the continuity of the
       longitudinal portion and of the hub respectively.
[0093] The raise mechanism 18 also comprises an actuator 30, like a hydraulic
       actuator. When the actuator retracts 30, the hub 16 is lifted. This actuator
       30 may be relied to the arms 28. It can eventually be linked to the
       longitudinal portion 12 at one end, and to the hub at the other end. The raise
       mechanism 18 is configured for lifting the beams 10 whilst generally keeping
       their orientation.
[0094] The raise mechanism 18 permits to lift the beams 10 above the wheels 14.
       In particular, the central portions 20 are lifted above the wheels 14. More
       peculiarly, the cutting units 6 linked under the central portions 20 are lifted
       above the wheels. At the end of the second operation, the mower 2 still
       extends on a broad area.
[0095] The figure 5 shows a third operation for folding the beams 10. The mower 2
       is seen in a top view.
[0096] In this operation, the central portions 20 of the beams 10 are pivoted
       inwardly. They are pivoted in a forward direction. The central portions 20
       are linked to the hub through rotation means 32. The rotation means 32 may
       rotate around generally vertical axis. These axes may be substantially tilted
       forwardly in order to bring down the forward extremities of the central
       portions 20. The rotation means 32 advantageously comprise actuators (not
       represented), like hydraulic actuators.
[0097] During the third operation, each central portion 20 is pivoted inwardly of an
       angle comprised between 50 and 90', preferably an angle comprised
       between 200 and 700, more preferably an angle comprised between 400 and
       600. At the end of this operation, the mower 2 reaches the transport
       configuration.
[0098] The figure 6 presents a side view of the transport configuration of the mower
       2.

                                           13
[0099] In this configuration, the beams 10 as a whole are placed above the wheels
        14. The cutting units linked to the beams are also above the wheels. As we
        can notice on this picture, the fact that the beams comprise several portions
        permits to reduce the overall length of the mower 2 in its transport
        configuration. Then, the mower 2 is easier to pull. It also requires less area
        for parking.
[00100] The raise mechanism 18 for lifting the hub 16 may be configured to slightly
        incline the stacked portions 22 and 20. The forward extremity of the stacked
        portions may be inclined downwardly in order to lower the center of gravity
        of the mower 2. Consequently, the stability of the mower is increased in
        spite of its height.
[00101] In the transport configuration, the mower 2 is less than 2,50 m width. Its
        height is less than 4,00 m, preferably less than 3,50 m high, more preferably
        less than 2,50 m high.
[00102] The figure 7 represents a cutting unit 6 according to the invention.
[00103] The cutting unit 6 may be a reel mower cutting unit. The cutting unit 6
        comprises a casing 36 that forms a shell. The cutting unit also comprises a
        cylinder 38 provided with at least one blade 40, preferably several blades
        40 that are distributed around the cylinder 38. The blade or the blades 40
        show a helicoidally shape. This shape describes a spiral around the
        cylinder. The bladed cylinder 38 may be hollow. It is pivotally articulated with
        respect to the casing 36. The width of the bladed cylinder 38 is at least 60
        cm, preferably at least 80 cm, more preferably at least 100 cm.
[00104] Each blade 40 shows a sharp outer edge. During mowing, the bladed
        cylinder 38 turns in a way that throws mowed lawn backward. The skilled
        person in the art is able to recognize the mowing direction of the mower
        considering the blades' sharp edges.
[00105] The casing 36 covers at least partially the bladed cylinder 38 for stopping
        projections of stones or particles present in the grass. It prevents injuries for
        people or damages for the mower itself.
[00106] The cutting unit 6 also comprises an engine 42 that rotates the bladed
        cylinder 38. The engine may be placed laterally, outside the casing 36. It
        may be driven electrically or hydraulically. The engine 36 is plugged by wires

                                           14
        or pressure ducts (not represented). The wires or the pressure ducts may
        extend inside the beams 10.
[00107] The cutting unit also comprises rolling means like a roller 44. The rolling
        means are adapted to engage the ground in a cutting configuration. They
        are configured for bearing at least the weight of the corresponding cutting
        unit 6. The rolling means permit to maintain an even cutting eight. They
        avoid cutting turf too shortly. The rolling means may comprise a single roller
        44 disposed in a rear or in a front position of cutting unit 6. The rolling means
        may eventually comprise a front roller and a rear roller. Each roller 44
        extends transversally on the majority of the bladed cylinder 38, preferably
        at least on the whole width of the bladed cylinder 38. The roller 44 is
        designed for withstanding chocks due to a stone lying in the grass.
[00108] The weight of the cutting unit is superior to 10 kg. The cutting unit 6 may be
        heavier than 30 kg. The cutting unit 6 may be heavier than 60 kg.
[00109] According to an alternative embodiment of the invention, the cutting unit
        may comprise a horizontal blade turning around a vertical axis. This
        horizontal blade may replace the cylinder.
[00110] The cutting unit 6 is linked to a beam of the mower. The mower comprises
        lift means that link the cutting unit 6 to the beam 10. The lift means may be
        articulating means. The lift means are configured for articulating the cutting
        unit 6 between a mowing position, in which the roller 44 may engage the
        ground, and a non-mowing position in which the roller is above the ground.
        Preferably, in the non-mowing position the roller is above the ground of at
        least 5 cm, preferably of at least 15 cm, more preferably of at least 40 cm.
[00111] The lift means comprise a crank 46 linked to the beam 10 and to the casing
        36 of the cutting unit 6. Each extremity of the crank 46 presents a pivot link.
        Each pivot link essentially comprises a single degree of freedom. The pivot
        axis of each pivot link is preferably longitudinally oriented. The cutting unit
        6 is free to rotate at the extremity of the crank 46. Then, it may flip in order
        to follow the shape of the ground when the mower is going on. This feature
        is interesting when the ground shows concave or convex surfaces
[00112] The lift means also comprise an actuator 48. The actuator 48 may be
        activated electrically or hydraulically. The actuator 48 may be a linear

                                             15
        actuator, preferably a linear hydraulic actuator. The actuator 48 may be
        linked to the crank 46 at one end and to the beam at the other end.
[00113] The lift means are configured for applying a load on the cutting unit 6. Then,
        the beam 10 and more generally the mower rely on the roller 44 of the
        cutting unit 6.
[00114] In an advantageous aspect of the invention, the mower comprises a plurality
        of lift means. Each cutting unit 6 is linked to the frame throw independent lift
        means. Independent lift means are configured for applying a load on each
        cutting unit 6. Then the frame's weight is distributed on all rollers of the
        cutting units. In the case drawn on figure 1, the frame's weight is distributed
        on 16,00 m width. All rollers act as a single roller that engages the ground
        and supports the mowers. Since the mower's wheels are longitudinally
        placed in the vicinity of the roller, the pressure applied by the wheels on the
        ground is reduced. In the case where the mower is an implement directly
        mounted on the frame of a tractor, the rollers will be able to support a part
        of the weight of the tractor.
