Detailed Description of Preferred Embodiments
[0045]      FIG. 1 shows an illustrative embodiment of a container 10 (e.g., bottle, jar, jug, or the
like) including a medallion or medal 12 separate from and carried by any suitable portion of the
container 10. The medal 12 may be non-removably retained to the container 10 and may be
used as a unique code for the container 10, as will be discussed in further detail herein below.
The terminology "non-removably retained" includes a manner in which the medal 12 is, by
design-intent, not intended to be removed from the container 10 without visible damage to the
container 10. The container 10 may be produced in accordance with illustrative embodiments
of a container manufacturing process presently disclosed herein below.
[0046]     The container 10 may be of any suitable shape, and may include a jug, jar, bottle,
other food or beverage container, or any other suitable container. The container 10 includes a
longitudinal axis A, a base (not shown) at one axial end of the container 10 that is closed in an
axial direction, a body 14 extending in an axial direction from the axially closed base, a
shoulder 16 extending axially and radially from the body 14, and a neck 18 extending axially
from the shoulder 16 and including a finish 20 having an open mouth 22 at another axial end of
the container 10 opposite of the base.        As used herein, the term "axial" includes oriented
generally along a longitudinal axis of the container 10 and may include but is not limited to a
direction that is strictly parallel to a container longitudinal central axis A. Likewise, the term
"radial" includes oriented generally along a radial line with respect to the longitudinal axis of the
container and may include but is not limited to a direction that is strictly perpendicular to the
container longitudinal central axis A. The body 14 may be of any suitable shape in cross
section transverse to the axis A as long as the body 14 is circumferentially closed.              For
example, the body 14 may be of cylindrical transverse cross-sectional shape that is
circumferentially closed. In other embodiments, the body 14 may be generally oval, square,
rectangular, triangular, or of any other suitable transverse cross-sectional shape. As used

                                                 -8
herein, the term "circumferentially" applies not only to circular transverse cross-sectional
shapes but also applies to any closed transverse cross-sectional shape.
[0047]     Referring to FIGS. 1 and 2, the medal 12 may be coupled to the body 14 of the
container 10 as illustrated, and/or may be coupled to any other suitable portion of the container
10, for example, the shoulder 16 or the neck 18 (FIG. 1). The medal 12 may be composed of
a rigid material, for instance, at least one of metal, glass, or ceramic, or any other suitable rigid
material, but preferably not plastic, or paper or other fibrous material.      The medal 12 may
include an outward surface 24 that may carry indicia 26 (FIG. 1), which may include a brand
name, logo, slogan, or any other suitable indicia. The container 10 may include a depression
28 in a body wall in which the medal 12 may be carried. The medal 12 also may include an
inward surface 30 that may carry an authentication code 32 (FIG. 1A), which may include a
serial number or the like. In another embodiment, the code 32 may be carried on the outward
surface 24 and the indicia 26 (FIG. 1) may be carried by the inward surface 30.
[0048]     The medal 12 is non-removably retained to the container 10 with material of one
piece construction integral with a wall of the container 10. For example, the container 10 also
may include a retainer 35, which may include a radially outwardly extending column, post,
stud, or peg 34 having an enlarged head 36 that traps the medal 12 between the head 36 and
the container body 14. The depression 28 and/or the peg 34 may be formed by corresponding
features in a blank mold and/or a blow mold. In one example, the head 36 may be formed by
swaging, or forming the free end of the peg 34 in any suitable manner. In another example,
the medal 12 may be insert molded to the container 10, for example, by any suitable insert
molding techniques in a blank or blow mold stage of container manufacturing. Although only
one peg 34 is illustrated, any suitable quantity of pegs 34 may be used to secure the medal 12
to the container 10.
[0049]     Referring to FIG. 3, the container 10 is shown with its body 14' in a pre-swaged
condition. The container 10 includes a radially outwardly extending peg 34' before swaging.
The medal 12 includes an aperture 38 therethrough between the outward and inward surfaces
24, 30. The medal 12 is applied to the container 10 over the peg 34' such that the peg 34'
protrudes through the medal aperture 38, and such that the inward surface 30 of the medal 12'
locates against an outward surface 40 of the container 10 within the depression 28. Then, the
peg 34' may be swaged so as to form the head 36 illustrated in FIGS. 1 and 2. Depending on
where in the manufacturing process the swaging is carried out, the swaging may be conducted
with or without application of additional heat to the peg 34'.

reactive material from premature exposure, and/or a scavenging material to protect the air
reactive material from premature exposure. Such materials and configurations are disclosed
and shown in conjunction with FIGS. 4-19 of U.S. Patent Application 13/832,589 (Attorney
Docket 19205 and entitled CONTAINER HAVING A USE INDICATOR), which was filed on the
same date as the present application and is assigned to the assignee hereof and is
incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
[0058]     The closure 342 may include a cap 344 that may be coupled to the container neck
finish 320 in any suitable manner, for example, by threading, friction fit, or in any other suitable
manner. The cap 344 may include a base wall 346, and an outer annular skirt 348 extending
axially from the base wall 346 and terminating in a lower edge 349.
[0059]     In one implementation of the present embodiment, the medal 312 may be completely
covered in an axial direction by the cap 344 wherein the lower edge 349 of the skirt 348
extends axially below the medal 312.         Also, the medal 312 may be sealed air-tight to the
container 310 wherein an inner surface of the lower edge 349 of the skirt 348 may be in full
circumferential sealing contact with the container neck 318.
[0060]     In another implementation, the closure 342 also may include a cover 350 that may
cover all or a portion of the closure cap 344 and extends below at least a portion of the medal
312 and over at least a portion of the container neck 318 in sealing contact therewith.          For
example, the cover 350 may be a shrink wrap, wax, or any other suitable covering that can
provide an air-tight seal. Accordingly, the medal 312 may also or instead be sealed air-tight to
the container 310 by the cover 350. The closure 342 and cover 350 are shown as being
transparent, but may be opaque or translucent so that the medal 312 may be visible from
outside the package.
[0061]     In a further implementation, the medal 312 may not be sealed air-tight to the
container 310 and, instead, may include a protective coating that may be removed when the
closure 342 is removed. For example, the closure 342 may be adapted to scrape, pull, or peel
the protective coating off of the medal 312 when the closure 342 is removed.                   More
particularly, a portion of the cap 344, for example, the lower edge 349 thereof, may be adapted
to scrape, pull, or peel the protective coating off the medal 312, for instance, via a sharp

                                                - 12
radially inwardly extending portion thereof. In the present embodiment, the medal 312 may
provide an indication of use of the package 311 as described and shown in conjunction with
FIGS. 1-3 of U.S. Patent Application 13/832,589 (Attorney Docket 19205 and entitled
CONTAINER HAVING A USE INDICATOR), which was filed on the same date as the present
application and is assigned to the assignee hereof and is incorporated herein by reference in
its entirety.
[0062]      During product packaging, the medal 312 may be assembled to the container 310 in
an inert environment in any suitable manner, and the closure 342 may be sealingly applied to
the container 310 to prevent oxidation of the medal 312.
[0063]      Upon initial packaging of the package 311, the medal 312 may exhibit an initial or
first state of a visual characteristic, for example, a first color or other appearance. (Therefore,
the medal 312 and the closure 342 may be assembled to the container 310 in a vacuum, in an
inert environment, or the like to prevent premature exposure of the medal 312.)          But when
exposed to air, for example, after removal of the closure 342 when initially opening the original
package 311, and responsive to such opening, the medal 312 may exhibit another, second
state of the visual characteristic, for example, a second color or other appearance. As used
herein, the term "opening" includes partial or complete opening of a container, for example,
partial turning or unthreading of a closure from the container or complete removal of a closure.
As used herein, the term "removal" may include partial or complete removal.
[0064]      The second state is different from and irreversible to the initial or first state.
Accordingly, the state-changed medal 312 may indicate design-intent use of the package 311,
like first time or initial container opening after the package 311 is factory sealed.          The
terminology "irreversible" includes a manner in which the medal is, by design-intent, modifiable
in one direction, for example, transparent to opaque and not back to transparent, or in another
example, opaque to transparent and not back to opaque.
[0065]      FIGS. 10-11 illustrate another illustrative embodiment of a container 410 that may
include a medal 412 responsive to a change associated with a closure 442 relative to the
container 410. This embodiment is similar in many respects to the embodiment of FIGS. 1-9
and like numerals between the embodiments generally designate like or corresponding
elements throughout the several views of the drawing figures. Accordingly, the descriptions of
the embodiments are incorporated into one another, and the description of the common
subject matter generally may not be repeated here.

                                               -13
[0066]     The container 410 may carry a medal 412, for example, on a container neck 418, or
in any other suitable location. The medal 412 may be non-removably retained to the container
410 by an integral retainer 435, which may include an enlarged head 436 of a stud 434
integrally formed with the container 410, or via any other suitable features, or in any other
suitable manner. The medal 412 may include a substrate 413 which may carry one or more
reactants 452 that react by receipt of electricity thereto from a power source. The reactants
452 may be carried in any suitable cavity, pocket, enclosed hollow portion, or the like, of the
substrate 413.
[0067]     Accordingly, the container 410 also may carry a normally open electrical circuit,
which may include a power source 454, which may include one or more batteries, quartz
piezoelectrics, capacitors, solar cells, or any other suitable supply of electricity. The power
source 454 may be carried by any suitable container wall and is electrically connectable to the
reactants 452 for electrifying the reactants 452 when the circuit is closed.       Therefore, the
container 410 additionally may carry a sensor 456, which may include contacts or any other
suitable configuration, and any suitable electrical conductor(s) 458 coupling the power source
454 to the sensor 456 and the reactants 452. The sensor 456 may be carried by a neck finish
420. The sensor 456 may include a capacitive proximity sensor, magnetic sensor (e.g. reed
switch), photoelectric sensor, inductive proximity sensor, or any other suitable sensor or
switch.   The conductor(s) 458 may include wiring, tracings, and/or the like.       The circuit is
shown as a schematic example, and any other suitable configurations suitable for powering an
element upon closure removal are contemplated.
[0068]     Moreover, the container 410 may be part of a package 411 including a closure 442
coupled to the neck finish 420 of the container 410. The sensor 456 may be configured to be
closed upon removal (partial or complete) of the closure 442 from the container 410. In one
embodiment, the closure 442 may be rotatably coupled to the container neck finish 420, for
example, via thread segments, or any other suitable container/closure engagement elements.
In such an embodiment, a portion of the closure 442 may displace one of the contacts of the
sensor 456 into engagement with the other of the sensor contacts to close the circuit and
discharge electricity from the battery 454 into the reactants 452.
[0069]     In a first implementation of the present embodiment, the reactant(s) 452 may include
electrochemically reactive products. For example, the reactants 452 may include magnesium,
zirconium, xenon, potassium chloride, or any other suitable materials that may ignite once

                                                -14
upon exposure to electricity and change appearance. Accordingly, the medal 412 and
reactants 452 may be similar to an old photographic flashcube.
[0070]     In a second implementation of the present embodiment, the reactant 452 may
include an electrochromic material.          For example, the reactant 452 may include an
electrochromic polymer, or any other suitable electrochromic material that may change at least
one of color or opacity upon exposure to electricity. Accordingly, the medal 412 may be an
electrochromic (or electrochromatic) device, which may include electrically switchable or
variable glass or glazing that has switchable or variable light transmission properties
depending on voltage applied thereto.         For example, in one or more embodiments, the
electrochromic device may include "Smart Glass," "EGlass," "smart sunglass," or "smart
window" light transmission technology.
[0071]     In any of the aforementioned implementations, the medal 412 may exhibit a first
visual characteristic, for example, a first color or other appearance before the reactant(s) 452
are electrified, as shown in FIG. 10.       But when exposed to electricity, for example, upon
removal of the closure 442, the medal 412 may exhibit a second visual characteristic, for
example, a second color or other appearance upon electrification of the reactants 452, as
shown in FIG. 11. In particular, the reactants 452 themselves may change appearance from a
light appearance to a dark appearance.          Accordingly, the state-changed medal 412 may
indicate design-intent use of the package 411, like first time or initial container opening after
the package 411 is factory sealed.
[0072]     In other related embodiments, the circuit, including the closure 442, battery 454
and/or sensor 456, may be configured differently, for example, as described and shown in
conjunction with FIGS. 10-15 of U.S. Patent Application 13/683,475 (Attorney Docket 19225
and entitled CONTAINER HAVING A USE-EVIDENT DEVICE), which was filed on November
21, 2012 and is assigned to the assignee hereof and is incorporated herein by reference in its
entirety.
[0073]     FIG. 12 illustrates another illustrative embodiment of a container 510 that may
include a medal 512 responsive to a change associated with a closure 542 relative to the
container 510. This embodiment is similar in many respects to the embodiment of FIGS. 1-11
and like numerals between the embodiments generally designate like or corresponding
elements throughout the several views of the drawing figures. Accordingly, the descriptions of

                                                -15
the embodiments are incorporated into one another, and the description of the common
subject matter generally may not be repeated here.
[0074]     The container 510 may be part of a package 511 including a closure 542 coupled to
a container neck finish 520 of the container 510, which may carry a medal 512, for example,
on a container neck 518, or in any other suitable location.         The medal 512 may be non
removably retained to the container 510 by an integral retainer 535, which may include an
enlarged head 536 of a stud 534 integrally formed with the container 510, or via any other
suitable features, or in any other suitable manner. The medal 512 may be or may include a
photochromic material, for example, photochromic glass or the like that may be activated by
ultraviolet light upon opening of the package 511.
[0075]     Accordingly, the container 510 also may carry an electrical circuit, which may include
a power source 554, an ultraviolet (UV) light source 560, and a sensor 556 and electrical
conductor(s) 558.       The power source 554 may include one or more batteries, quartz
piezoelectrics, capacitors, solar cells, or any other suitable supply of electricity. The power
source 554 may be carried by any suitable container wall and is electrically connectable to the
UV light source 560 for generating UV light when the sensor 556 is closed. The sensor 556
may include a capacitive proximity sensor, magnetic sensor (e.g. reed switch), photoelectric
sensor, inductive proximity sensor, or any other suitable sensor or switch and related wiring,
tracings, and/or the like. In a reed switch embodiment or the like, the closure 542 may carry a
sensor activator 562, for instance, a magnet, a ferrous metal, or any other suitable sensor
activation component.     The UV light source 560 may include one or more UV light emitting
diodes (LEDs), or any other suitable source(s) of UV light.
[0076]     The sensor 556 may be configured to be closed upon removal (partial or complete)
of the closure 542 from the container 510.          In one embodiment, the closure 542 may be
rotatably coupled to the container neck finish 520, for example, via thread segments, or any
other suitable container/closure engagement elements.          In the illustrated embodiment, the
sensor activator 562 may pass by the sensor 556 to activate the sensor 556 and thereby close
the circuit and discharge electricity from the battery 554 to the UV light source 560.     Such
circuits and components are disclosed and shown in U.S. Patent Application 13/679,506
(Attorney Docket 19254 and entitled PRODUCT AND PACKAGE WITH A PHOTOSENSITIVE
USE-EVIDENT FEATURE), which was filed on November 16, 2012 and is assigned to the
assignee hereof and is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

                                                   -16
[0077]      The medal 512 may exhibit a first visual characteristic, for example, a first color or
other appearance before the UV light source 560 is energized. But when exposed to UV light,
for example, upon removal of the closure 542, the medal 512 may exhibit a second visual
characteristic, for example, a second color or other appearance upon energizing of the light
source 560. Accordingly, the state-changed medal 512 may indicate use of the package 511,
like first time or initial container opening after the package 511 is factory sealed. As used
herein, the term "use" may include design intent use, for example, package opening, product
dispensing, and/or the like, but also may include unintended or unauthorized use, for example,
product removal, product dilution, addition of counterfeit product, and/or the like.
[0078]       In the illustrated embodiment, the UV light source 560 may be carried inside the
container 510 on a wall thereof, which may be opposite that of the medal 512. Accordingly,
the activated light source 560 will darken the glass 552 after opening and dispensing of certain
UV blocking products P. In other embodiments, the UV light source 560 would be carried by
the container 510 on a wall thereof in a location immediately adjacent or behind the medal 512.
Accordingly, the activated light source 560 will darken the glass 552 upon opening even if the
product P is a UV blocking type of product.
[0079]      The container 510 may include a UV protector to protect the medal 512 from
premature exposure to UV light. The UV protector may be carried by the container 510, either
directly or indirectly. The UV protector may include any suitable UV blocking, UV absorbing,
and/or UV retarding material or element of any kind. For example, UV protective material may
include vanadium, selenium, carbon, iron, other glass colorant materials or colored glass,
and/or the like. The UV protective material may be part of the container composition itself, a
coating on interior and/or exterior surfaces of a substrate of the container 510 and/or the medal
512, and/or the like. In another example, the UV protector may include a shrink sleeve (not
shown) around the container 510 and medal 512 and which includes UV protective material
and which may be translucent or transparent. In any case, the UV protector may be provided
over, around, or radially outward of, the medal 512 to protect it from exposure to UV light from
outside the package 510.
[0080]       FIG. 13 illustrates another illustrative embodiment of a package 611 that may include
a medal 612 responsive to a change associated with a closure 542 relative to the container
510. This embodiment is similar in many respects to the embodiment of FIGS. 1-12 and like
numerals between the embodiments generally designate like or corresponding elements
throughout the several views of the drawing figures.          Accordingly, the descriptions of the

                                              -17
embodiments are incorporated into one another, and the description of the common subject
matter generally may not be repeated here.
[0081]     The package 611 is substantially similar to the package 511 of FIG. 12 including the
container 510 and the closure 542, but including a different medal 612. The medal 612 may
include a substrate 613 including a UV protector, and a sintered layer of photochromic glass
652 that may be applied to a rear (container facing) surface of the substrate 613.          The
substrate 613 may be composed of a UV protector material and/or may be coated with same.
In another implementation, the photochromic glass 652 instead may be applied to a portion of
the container 510 corresponding in outer profile to the medal 612.
[0082]     In either case, the photochromic glass 652 may include any suitable metal halide
material, which may include silver, copper, and/or cadmium with chlorine halide, bromine
halide, and/or iodine halide.    The photochromic material may include any suitable material
selected from the group(s) consisting of the aforementioned materials, or from any other
suitable photochromic material(s).     The layer may be produced and applied by selectively
applied ceramic label (ACL) or in a manner similar to ACL, which techniques - in and of
themselves - are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. For example, a metal halide
containing glass may be produced, pulverized into fine particles of glass, and combined with
organic binders, lubricants, flowing agents, and the like to produce a compound that can be
heated and flowed onto the container 510 and/or the medal substrate 613 using screen
printing or any other suitable techniques. Thereafter, the container 510 and/or medal substrate
612 with the sintered layer thereon may be heat treated, for example, through a decoration lehr
to sinter the glass particles onto the container 510 and/or substrate 613. The photochromic
glass 652 may be activated by ultraviolet light upon opening of the package 511.            The
photochromic glass 652 is protected by premature exposure to ambient UV light impinging on
the outside of the package 611 by the UV protective medal substrate 613.           Likewise, the
photochromic glass 652 is protected from ambient UV light shining through the container 510
by flowable product P in the container 510. For example, some spirits, for instance, cognac,
scotch whiskey, whiskey, and/or the like absorb much of the UV spectrum and can be used as
a UV protector for the photochromic glass 652.
[0083]     Again, the container 510 may carry the electrical circuit, with the power source 554,
the UV light source 560, and the sensor 556 and conductor(s) 558. And again, the sensor 556
may be configured to be closed upon removal (partial or complete) of the closure 542 from the

                                                  -18
container 510 so as to discharge electricity from the battery 554 to the UV light source 560.
UV light will impinge on the photochromic glass 652 to darken it.
[0084]      Therefore, the medal 612 may exhibit a first visual characteristic, for example, a first
color or other appearance before the UV light source 560 is energized. But when exposed to
UV light, for example, upon removal of the closure 542, the medal 612 or at least the
photochromic glass 652, may exhibit a second visual characteristic, for example, a second
color or other appearance upon energizing of the light source 560. Accordingly, the state
changed medal 612 or photochromic glass 652 may indicate design-intent use of the package
611, like first time or initial container opening after the package 611 is factory sealed.
[0085]      FIG. 14 illustrates another illustrative embodiment of a container 710 that may
include a medal 712 responsive to a change associated with a closure 742 relative to the
container 710. This embodiment is similar in many respects to the embodiment of FIGS. 1-13
and like numerals between the embodiments generally designate like or corresponding
elements throughout the several views of the drawing figures. Accordingly, the descriptions of
the embodiments are incorporated into one another, and the description of the common
subject matter generally may not be repeated here.
[0086]      The container 710 may be part of a package 711 including a closure 742 coupled to
a neck finish 720 of a neck 718 of the container 710. The closure 742 may include a base wall
746, and an outer skirt 748 extending axially from the base wall 746. The closure 742 may be
coupled to the container 710 in any suitable manner, for instance, via thread segments or any
other suitable cooperative engagement elements on the container 710 and closure 742.
[0087]      The container 710 may carry a medal 712, for example, on the container neck 718,
or in any other suitable location.        The medal 712 may be non-removably retained to the
container 710 by an integral retainer 735, which may include an enlarged head 736 of a stud
734 integrally formed with the container 710, or via any other suitable features, or in any other
suitable manner. The medal 712 may include a body portion 764 trapped between the head
736 and the container 710, and an extension portion 766 that extends axially toward the
closure 742. The extension portion 766 may be radially spaced away from the container 710
and may extend axially into the closure 742. The medal 712 would be fully intact between the
body and extension portions 764, 766 after initial packaging of the package 711, thereby
indicating an authentic product.

                                              -19
[0088]     But upon partial or complete removal of the closure 742, the medal 712 would be
severed by the closure 742. For example, the closure skirt 748 may include a cutter 768 that
may extend radially inwardly from a lower portion of the skirt 748. The cutter 768 may extend
partially or completely circumferentially around the skirt 748, and may include a separate
component or may include a sharp, radially inwardly extending, integral portion of the closure
742 itself. In another implementation, the cutter 768 may be exposed only upon application of
axial downward pressure of the closure 742 toward the container 710.
[0089]      Upon removal of the closure 742, the cutter 748 cuts through the medal 712
between the extension portion 766 and the body portion 764.           The severed medal 712
provides an indication that the package 711 has been opened from its authentic, as-packaged
state.   The medal 712 may be relatively thin and of relatively soft metal composition, for
instance, copper, or may be plastic and overmolded to the closure 742.
[0090]     FIGS. 15-17 illustrate another illustrative embodiment of a package 811 that may
include a medal 812 responsive to a change associated with a closure 842 relative to a
container 810. This embodiment is similar in many respects to the embodiment of FIGS. 1-14
and like numerals between the embodiments generally designate like or corresponding
elements throughout the several views of the drawing figures. Accordingly, the descriptions of
the embodiments are incorporated into one another, and the description of the common
subject matter generally may not be repeated here.
[0091]     Referring to FIG. 15, the package 811 includes a container 810 including an
electromagnetic medal 812 non-removably retained to the container 810 via an integral portion
of the container 810, for instance, via an integral retainer 835 which may include an enlarged
head 836 of the container 810. The package 811 also may include an electrical circuit, which
may include the aforementioned components of the various electrical circuits described herein,
including a power source 854, a sensor 856 and one or more electrical conductors 858
coupled to the medal 812.
[0092]     With reference to FIG. 16, the medal 812 may include a first member 870 that may
be fixed to and positioned adjacent to the container 810, and a second member 872 that may
be movably coupled with respect to the container 810 and disposed radially outward of the first
member 870 such that the first member 870 is positioned between the second member 872
and the container 810. The first member 870 includes a first magnetic element 871 and the
second member 872 includes a second magnetic element 873 for cooperation with the first

                                                  - 20
magnetic element 871. The magnetic elements 871, 873 may be fixed to or integral with the
corresponding members 870, 872.
[0093]       With reference to FIG. 17, the first member 870 (FIG. 16) may include one or more
first portions 874 and one or more second portions 875 different in appearance than the first
portions 874. For example, the first portions 874 may be light in appearance, for instance,
white, and the second portions 875 may be dark in appearance, for instance, black. In other
examples, the portions 874, 875 may be different colors, may exhibit different indicia, or may
exhibit any other different appearance.        The portions 874, 875 may include four 90-degree
quadrants or any other suitable shape and configuration.
[0094]        Referring again to FIG. 15, the second member 872 may include one or more
windows 876, for example, apertures, to provide visible access to one or more portions of the
first member 870 (FIG. 16).        The windows 876 may include two diametrically opposed 90
degree quadrants or may be of any other suitable shape and configuration. In any event, the
windows 876 may correspond to the portions 874 of the first member 870 (FIG. 16) to provide
visible access thereto. In an as-packaged state, the windows 876 may be oriented to expose
or provide visible access to the first portions 874 of the first member 870 (FIG. 16), for
example, to provide an indication that the package 811 is authentic and has not been opened.
[0095]        Upon partial or complete removal of the closure 842, however, the windows 876 may
be oriented to expose the second portions 875 of the first member 870 (FIG. 16).                   For
example, upon removal of the closure 842 the first magnetic element 871 may be powered via
the circuit. More specifically, the electrical circuit may include the first magnetic element 871,
which may be coupled to the power source 854 to energize the first magnetic element 871
upon removal of the closure 842. Energizing of the magnetic element 871 causes attraction of
the second magnetic element 873 thereby causing rotation of the second member 872. Such
rotation may continue until the magnetic elements 871, 873 contact one another and the
windows 876 are oriented so as to expose the second portions 875 of the first member, for
example, to provide an indication that the package 811 has been opened.
[0096]       Those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the second member 872 may be
rotatably coupled to the container 810, for instance, about the integral container peg 834, and
that the first member 870 (FIG. 16) may be fixed to the container 810 against rotation by being
friction fit to the peg 834, or in any other suitable manner. But artisans of ordinary skill will also
recognize that the second member 872 could be fixed and the first member 870 (FIG. 16)

                                                  -21
could be rotatable. Artisans of ordinary skill would also recognize that the electromagnetic
medal 812 could include linearly movable first and second members instead of the illustrated
rotatable members.
[0097]     In either implementation, the second member 872 is not movable with respect to the
first member 870 (FIG. 16) absent energizing of the magnetic element.            For example, a
protective cover (now shown) may be non-removably coupled to the container 810 over the
members 870, 872, or any suitable electrical functionality may be used to maintain the member
872 in place. Also, ratchet features could be provided between the members 870, 872 to
prevent or provide an indication tampering with the medal 812.
[0098]     FIG. 18 illustrates another illustrative embodiment of a package 911 that may include
a medal 912 responsive to a change associated with a closure 942 relative to a container 910.
This embodiment is similar in many respects to the embodiment of FIGS. 1-17 and like
numerals between the embodiments generally designate like or corresponding elements
throughout the several views of the drawing figures.        Accordingly, the descriptions of the
embodiments are incorporated into one another, and the description of the common subject
matter generally may not be repeated here.
[0099]     The package 911 includes a container 910 and a closure 942 coupled to a container
neck 918 and, more particularly, to a neck finish (not separately shown) of the container 910.
The package 911 also includes a medal 912 non-removably retained to the container neck 918
in a location axially adjacent to the closure 942. Although the illustrated embodiment includes
an enlarged head 936 of an integral retainer 935 consistent with previously disclosed
embodiments herein, those of ordinary skill in the art would recognize that the medal 912 may
be non-removably retained by two or more such integral retainers, a pocketed retainer feature
similar to FIGS. 4 and 7, or in any other suitable manner.
[0100]     The closure 942 may include a base wall 946, an outer annular skirt 948 extending
axially from the base wall 946 and terminating in an axial end surface 949, and a cam 978
carried by the skirt 948 for example, between the axial end surface 949 and the base wall 946.
The skirt 948 may have an outer surface, and the cam 978 may extend radially outwardly with
respect to the outer surface 948 of the skirt. For example, the cam 978 may include a leading
edge 979 circumferentially adjacent to a cylindrical outer surface of the skirt 948, and a cam
lobe 981 projected radially outwardly and extending circumferentially around a portion of the
skirt 948.

                                               -22
[0101]     During manufacture of the package 911, the closure 942 may be applied and
tightened to the container 910 in any suitable manner, and then the medal 912 may be coupled
to the container 910 with a rear surface facing the container 910. The medal 912 is coupled to
the container 910 so that a portion of the medal 912 axially overlaps the closure 942. More
specifically, the portion of the medal 912 may axially overlap the axial end surface 949 of the
skirt 948, and at least a portion of the cam 978, such that when the closure 942 is rotated, the
overlapping portion of the medal 912 overlaps at least a portion of the cam 978.
[0102]     In use, and from the as-packaged state of the package 911, the closure 942 may be
rotated with respect to the container 910 so as to force the cam 978 into engagement with the
medal 912, for example, with the rear surface thereof. Continued rotation of the closure 942
with respect to the container 910 causes increasingly larger portions of the lobe 981 of the cam
978 to engage the medal 912 and thereby apply increased force to the medal 912. In turn, the
force on the medal 912 is directed to the integral retainer feature 935, which eventually breaks
under the applied force before the closure 942 is completely removed from the container 910.
Accordingly, a portion of the container may be broken to free the medal 912 from the container
910 for keeping as a collectors' or promotional item.
[0103]     FIG. 19 illustrates another illustrative embodiment of a package 1011 that may
include a medal 1012 responsive to a change associated with a closure 1042 relative to a
container 1010. This embodiment is similar in many respects to the embodiment of FIGS. 1-18
and like numerals between the embodiments generally designate like or corresponding
elements throughout the several views of the drawing figures. Accordingly, the descriptions of
the embodiments are incorporated into one another, and the description of the common
subject matter generally may not be repeated here.
[0104]     The package 1011 includes a container 1010, a closure 1042 coupled to the
container 1010, a medal 1012 carried by the container 1010, and a flaccid loop 1080 coupled
to the medal 1012 and having a portion carried between the closure 1042 and the container
1010. The closure 1042 may be coupled to the neck finish 1020 of the container 1010 via
cooperating thread segments, or any other suitable engagement elements, or in any other
suitable manner. The flaccid loop 1080 may include a chain, as illustrated, a cord, a cable, or
any other suitable flaccid loop, and may be used as a necklace or for any other suitable
purpose. The loop 1080 may extend over the neck finish 1020 in any suitable manner that
allows for closure 1042 application and removal.      For example, the loop 1080 may extend
through axially extending interruptions in thread segments thereof to allow the closure 1042 to

                                              - 23
be threaded to the neck finish 1020 over the loop 1080. Also, the loop 1080 may extend over
the open mouth of the container 1010 as illustrated, and/or may wrap around the neck finish
1020.
[0105]     From the as-packaged state, the closure 1042 may be removed from the container
1010 to allow the loop 1080 and the attached medal 1012 to be removed from the package
1011, at least in one embodiment. In another embodiment, as illustrated, the medal 1012 may
be non-removably retained to the container 1010 via an integral retainer 1035, for example, an
enlarged head 1036 of a peg. Accordingly, a user may pry on the medal 1012 to break the
retainer 1035 and free the medal 1012.
[0106]     In either embodiment, the medal 1012 and/or the loop 1080 may be used as a
collectors' or promotional item. The lack of such item(s) from a package is in indication that
the package is not authentic or is counterfeit.       As with any of the presently disclosed
embodiments, the closure 1042 may be coupled to the container 1010 with a tamper-evident
band (not separately shown), overwrapped foil seal, or any other accessories.
[0107]     FIG. 20 illustrates another illustrative embodiment of a package 1111 that may
include a medal 1112 responsive to a change associated with a closure 1142 relative to a
container 1110. This embodiment is similar in many respects to the embodiment of FIGS. 1-19
and like numerals between the embodiments generally designate like or corresponding
elements throughout the several views of the drawing figures. Accordingly, the descriptions of
the embodiments are incorporated into one another, and the description of the common
subject matter generally may not be repeated here.
[0108]     The package 1111 includes a container 1110, a closure 1142 coupled to the
container 1110, and a medal 1112 carried by the container 1110 and retained thereto with an
integral retainer 1135 of the container 1110. The integral retainer 1135 may be similar to that
shown and described with reference to FIGS. 4-7 except, in one example, the portion 1135 has
an open axial end 1137 out of which the medal 1112 may protrude axially.
[0109]     The closure 1142 includes a base wall 1146, an outer annular skirt 1148 that
extends axially from the base wall 1146 and terminates in an axial end 1149.          Those of
ordinary skill in the art would recognize that the end 1149 may be part of a tamper indicating
band (not separately sown) of the closure 1142 or a main body portion of the closure 1142.

                                               - 24
[0110]     The medal 1112 may include a body 1164 carried in the integral retainer 1135 and
having an axial end 1166 that may be carried between the container 1110 and the closure
1142 wherein the closure 1142 covers a portion of the medal 1112. Accordingly, a portion of
the medal 1164 may axially overlap a corresponding portion of the closure 1142 to block
access to the axial end 1166 of the medal 1112.
[0111]      During manufacture of the package 1111, the medal 1112 may be coupled to the
container 1110 via the integral retainer 1135 by sliding the medal 1112 into a pocket defined
radially between the retainer 1135 and an outer surface of the container neck 1118, or by
forming the retainer 1135 over the medal 1112, for example at edges 1136, or any suitable
manner. Thereafter, the closure 1142 may be non-removably retained to the container 1110
so that the axial edge 1149 of the skirt 1148 extends below the axial end 1166 of the medal
1112.
[0112]      In use, the closure 1142 may be completely removed from the container 1110 to
expose and allow access to the axial end 1166 of the medal 1112. At that point, a user may
remove the medal 1112 by grasping the end 1166 of the medal 1112, and sliding it out of the
retainer 1135 or breaking it free from the retainer 1135, or in any other suitable manner.
[0113]      FIG. 21 illustrates another illustrative embodiment of a container 1210.       This
embodiment is similar in many respects to the embodiment of FIGS. 1-20 and like numerals
between the embodiments generally designate like or corresponding elements throughout the
several views of the drawing figures. Accordingly, the descriptions of the embodiments are
incorporated into one another, and the description of the common subject matter generally
may not be repeated here.
[0114]     The container 1210 may include a medal 1212 non-removably retained to an outer
surface thereof consistent with previously disclosed embodiments.        For example, the medal
1212 may be retained to the container 1210 with integral retainers 1235 of the container 1210
itself. In the illustrated embodiment, the retainers 1235 may include enlarged heads 1236 of
integral container pegs (not separately shown) to trap edges of the medal 1212 to the
container 1210. Of course, any other suitable configuration may be used including retainers
extending through apertures (not shown) through the medal 1212, or a retaining frame over the
outer periphery of the medal 1212 like that of FIGS. 4 and 7, or the like.

                                                - 25
[0115]     The medal 1212 and portions of the container 1210 adjacent or surrounding the
medal 1212 may have a shared unique appearance. An example shared unique appearance
is indicated schematically by a common continuous pattern, for instance a wavy line pattern,
over both the medal 1212 and at least a portion of the container 1210. In another example of a
shared unique appearance, common continuous indicia (like text or numerals) may extend
over both the container 1210 and the medal 1212. The indicia may include a serial number,
phrase, or any other suitable indicia.
[0116]     The medal 1212 may be removed from the container 1210 by using a key or other
implement to pry on the medal 1212 and fracture the integral retainers 1235. But once the
medal 1212 is removed from the container 1210, it cannot be easily replaced with a
replacement medal because its appearance would not be shared with the original container.
Accordingly, the attached medal 1212 and appearance shared with the container 1210 provide
an anti-counterfeit measure.
[0117]     In general, the containers described above can be produced in any suitable manner.
[0118]     The containers may be composed of glass, plastic, or metal, and may be of one
piece integrally formed construction.      (The term "integrally formed construction" does not
exclude one-piece integrally molded layered constructions of the type disclosed in, for
example, U.S. Patent 4,740,401, or one-piece containers to which other structure is added
after the container-forming operation.)       In a glass embodiment, the containers may be
fabricated in a press-and-blow, narrow neck press-and-blow, or a blow-and-blow container
manufacturing operation.     In a plastic embodiment, the containers may be produced in an
injection, compression, and/or blow molding operation. In a metal embodiment, the containers
may be manufactured in a roll forming and welding operation, or in any other suitable manner.
Below, an example glass container manufacturing process is described.         But many of the
principles described     below are     applicable to   plastic container and  metal   container
manufacturing processes.
[0119]     For example, a typical glass container manufacturing process includes a "hot end"
and a "cold end." The hot end may include one or more glass melting furnaces to produce a
glass melt, one or more forming machines to form the glass melt into containers, and one or
more applicators to apply a hot-end coating to the containers. The "hot end" also may include
an annealing lehr, or at least a beginning portion of the annealing lehr, for annealing the
containers therein.    Through the lehr, the temperature may be brought down gradually to a

                                               - 26
downstream portion, cool end, or exit of the lehr. The "cold end" may include an end portion of
the annealing lehr, applicators to apply one or more cold-end coatings to the containers
downstream of the annealing lehr, inspection equipment to inspect the containers, and
packaging machines to package the containers.
[0120]     In conjunction with the above description, the containers may be produced by the
following container manufacturing process, which may or may not include all of the disclosed
steps or be sequentially processed or processed in the particular sequence discussed, and the
presently disclosed manufacturing process and marking methods encompass any sequencing,
overlap, or parallel processing of such steps.
[0121]     First, a batch of glass-forming materials may be melted.    For example, a melting
furnace may include a tank with melters to melt soda-lime-silica to produce molten glass.
Thereafter, the molten glass may flow from the tank, through a throat, and to a refiner at the
downstream end of the furnace where the molten glass may be conditioned.              From the
furnace, the molten glass may be directed toward a downstream forehearth that may include a
cooling zone, a conditioning zone, and a downstream end in communication with a gob feeder.
The feeder may measure out gobs of glass and deliver them to a container forming operation.
[0122]     Next, the glass gobs may be formed into containers, for example, by forming
machines, which may include press-and-blow or blow-and-blow individual section machines, or
any other suitable forming equipment.      Blank molds may receive the glass gobs from the
feeder and form parisons or blanks, which may be at a temperature on the order of 900-1100
degrees Celsius.     Blow molds may receive the blanks from the blank molds and form the
blanks into containers, which may be at a temperature on the order of 700-900 degrees
Celsius. Material handling equipment may remove the containers from the forming machines
and place the containers on conveyors or the like.
[0123]    Also, the formed containers may be annealed, for example, by an annealing lehr. At
an entry, hot end, or upstream portion of the annealing lehr, the temperature therein may be,
for instance, on the order of 500-700 degrees Celsius. Through the lehr, the temperature may
be brought down gradually to a downstream portion, cool end, or exit of the lehr, for example,
to a temperature therein on the order of 100 degrees Celsius.

                                               - 27
[0124]     At any suitable point(s) in the manufacturing process, the containers are tagged with
medals. The tagging step includes applying medals to the containers or to the blanks to mark
the containers or blanks.
[0125]     In one example, the medals may be applied to the blanks in the blank molds or to the
containers in the blow molds, for instance, by insert molding the medals onto the bases of the
blanks or the containers as they are formed. For example, a robotic arm or pick-and-place unit
may be used to pick up a medal and place it in a recess or detent in a mold. Accordingly, in
one embodiment, a forming step may include sub-steps of forming a blank and then forming
the container from the blank, wherein the medal is insert molded to the blank during the blank
forming step. In another embodiment, the forming step may includes sub-steps of forming a
blank and then forming the container from the blank, wherein the medal is insert molded to the
container during the container forming step.
[0126]     In another example, the medals may be applied to the containers downstream of the
blow molds. For instance, portions of the containers may be swaged to retain the medals to
the containers between the forming and annealing steps, using any suitable material handling
and swaging equipment.        The swaging equipment may include heaters to heat the container
projections before and/or during swaging, and may include swaging heads to contact and
deform the container projections over the medals.        For example, the heaters may include
torches, induction coils, lasers, or any other suitable heating devices, and the swaging heads
may include rotary, reciprocating, vibrational, or other types of swaging heads.        As used
herein, the term "swage" includes cold or hot swaging, stationary or rotary swaging, or any
other suitable process of forming container material with respect to the medals to secure the
medals to the containers.
[0127]     The container forming step may include forming a radially outwardly extending peg
integrally with a wall of the container.  Also, the container forming step may include forming a
depression in the wall of the container around the peg. In another embodiment, the container
forming step may includes forming a radially outwardly extending rim in a wall of the container.
[0128]     The retaining step may include placing the medal over the peg and against the
container wall and swaging the peg, so that container material flows axially or transversely with
respect to the axis of the peg, thereby forming a head on the peg to trap the medal between
the head and the container wall so that the head extends over a portion of the medal to non
removably retain the medal to the container. Also, the retaining step may include placing the

                                              - 28
medal in a depression formed in the container. In another embodiment, the retaining step may
include placing the medal within a rim and against the container wall and swaging the rim over
a radially outer edge of the medal to form a retaining flange on the rim to trap the medal
between the flange and the container wall so that the rim flange extends over a portion of the
medal to non-removably retain the medal to the container. In either embodiment, the retaining
step may include applying the medal to the container so that decorative indicia on one side of
the medal faces outwardly, and/or so that authentication indicia on one side of the medal faces
inwardly. Also, in either embodiment, the retaining step further may include applying solder
glass between the medal and the container, adhering the medal to the container with an
adhesive, or the like, for example, to supplement retention of the medal to the container.
[0129]     In any case, the medals are non-removably retained to corresponding wall(s) of the
containers so that the medals cannot be removed without destroying or damaging the
containers, such that the medals serve as tamper-resistant authentication markers. If desired,
the container may be damaged or destroyed to gain separate access to the medals, for
example, where the medals are sought after as collectors' items. Accordingly, separate bar
code labels or the like need not be applied to the containers. Unlike typical bar code labels
that are flexible and can be easily torn away from containers, the presently disclosed medals
are rigid and cannot be pulled away from the containers without breaking one or more portions
of the containers. And even if the medals could somehow be removed, replacement medals
could not be attached to the containers in their original manner thereby providing indication of
a lack of authenticity.     Bar code labels and the like may be easily tampered with, add
significant cost to the process, and may detract from a brand appeal of a product.
[0130]     In use, a product manufacturer can fill a container with product, record an
authentication code from the container medal, and store information about the product in
conjunction with the serial code as a record in a production database or the like. Later in the
product cycle, a distributor, consumer, or the like can read the serial code from the medal,
access the manufacturer's production database via the Internet or otherwise, and search the
database for the serial code to authenticate the container and/or the product inside the
container.
[0131]     Accordingly, the medals can be used throughout a distribution and supply chain for
container or product tracking and tracing, returning and refilling, and/or authenticity verification
of the container and/or the product contained within the container. For example, a variety of
attributes can be verified or added during the product cycle, for instance, the date and/or

                                                 -29
location of manufacture of the container, the product contained within the container,
authenticity of the container and/or the product therein. In some of the embodiments, the act
of removing the closure and/or the medal causes visible damage to the container. Also in
some embodiments, for instance with those shown in FIGS. 19 and 20, the medal may be
removed without damage to the container and the fact that the medal is missing is an
indication that the package has been previously opened, is counterfeit, or the like.
[0132]      There thus has been disclosed a container and methods of manufacture, that fully
satisfy all of the objects and aims previously set forth. The disclosure has been presented in
conjunction with several illustrative embodiments, and additional modifications and variations
have been discussed. Other modifications and variations readily will suggest themselves to
persons of ordinary skill in the art in view of the foregoing discussion.
[0133]      This application is a divisional application of Australian patent application number
2014237775, whose specification as originally filed is hereby incorporated by reference in its
entirety.
