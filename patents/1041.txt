    BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
            Parkinson's disease is a debilitating disease caused by the death of dopamine
    neurons in the central nervous system. Parkinson's disease patients experience life
    altering symptoms of tremors, slowness in moving, and difficulty walking. While no
15  drugs exist which cure the disease or stop its progression, a number of drugs exist to help
    with symptoms. The most commonly used drug and the drug all Parkinson's patients
    eventually use is levodopa. Levodopa (also referred to herein as "levodopa") is currently
    supplied in tablets with or without one or two other drugs. The other drugs typically
    function to prevent the body from metabolizing the levodopa before it can take its effect.
20  Many patients initially respond well to levodopa treatment, but over time the effect
    becomes diminished. Patients typically start increasing their levodopa dosage as their
    disease progresses. A patient at the early stages of taking levodopa may only take 200
    mg of levodopa per day, but a later stage patient could be taking 600 to 1200 mg of
    levodopa a day. Once the doses increase, patients become prone to dyskinesis.
25  Dyskinesis are involuntary movements due to too much levodopa. When patient
    levodopa concentrations go to low, patients experience freezing episodes where the
    patient has significant difficulty moving. Once a freezing episode occurs, patient can
    take a tablet of levodopa, but they have to wait until the levodopa is absorbed to become
    unfrozen. Further complicating the freezing problem is that Parkinson's patients have
30  poor stomach motility resulting in slow drug absorption. An inhalable formulation of
    levodopa could help patients with these freezing issues. A difficulty in creating an
                                                 -1 -

  WO 2014/074795                                                             PCT/US2013/069102
    inhalable levodopa product is delivering enough dose to the patient, since levodopa is a
    high dose drug. Another difficulty is delivering an inhaled drug to a Parkinson's patient.
    Since these patients are movement impaired, they need a quick and simple process to
    inhale the levodopa.
 5           In addition to the above difficulties with delivering levodopa, a number of
    difficulties exist with delivering high doses of any drug by the pulmonary route. A dry
    powder containing a drug can vary greatly in density. Modifying the density of the
    powder can affect stability and the ability of the drug to reach the lungs appropriately.
    However, optimizing the density of the levodopa inhalable powder enables the effective
10  delivery of high doses of levodopa to the patient by inhalation. Even if appropriate
    density can be reached for a high dose drug such as levodopa, the efficient emptying of
    the powder from the capsule is also a critical factor. If the emptying characteristics of
    the capsule are poor, the increased dosage achieved by optimal loading of the powder
    into the capsule is diminished.
15           A number of important challenges exist to deliver a high dose of levodopa to a
    Parkinson's patient while also keeping the drug product stable and easy to use for the
    patient. Pulmonary powders may be provided in amorphous form as amorphous forms
    of a compound have faster dissolution and would be more likely to show a fast onset of
    action. Despite the advantage of fast onset of action for an amorphous powder,
20  amorphous powders are difficult to manufacture and difficult to keep stable under long
    term storage conditions, as required by the drug regulatory agencies. Further, filling
    large volumes of amorphous powders in a capsule can be challenging due to electrostatic
    charges. For crystalline powders, increasing the relative humidity can reduce the
    electrostatic charge of the powder and allow for better capsule filling, but increasing the
25  relative humidity is not a viable option for an amorphous powder. Amorphous powders
    become prone to amorphous to crystalline transitions under elevated relative humidity.
    Thus, a significant difficulty exists in identifying a fast acting amorphous powder which
    is stable with a low electrostatic charge.

    DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
            The capsules according to the invention are for use in an inhalation device and
    contain, as the inhalable powder, levodopa mixed with one or more physiologically
    acceptable excipients, characterized in that the powder has a working density (also
10  referred to herein as "bulk density") of about 100 g/L or less which can also be expressed
    as about 0.1 g/cm 3 or less. Because levodopa is a high dose drug and delivering large
    amounts of levodopa is difficult for pulmonary delivery, it would be desirable to have a
    low density powder. A low density powder could allow for a significantly higher dose of
    levodopa per capsule than an average density powder. A difficulty is that low density
15  levodopa powders are difficult to achieve while still allowing for a powder that can be
    easily filled into a capsule. In one embodiment the invention provides capsules
    containing an inhalable powder comprising levodopa wherein the capsule has superior
    emptying characteristics upon delivery of the powder from the capsule upon actuation
    when used in conjunction with an inhaler. Superior emptying from the capsule is an
20  important characteristic of a capsule containing an inhalable powder comprising
    levodopa.
            The capsules for inhalation according to the invention are filled with inhalable
    powder containing levodopa, wherein that the powder has a working density of less than
    about 0.1 g/cm 3. In one embodiment the powder has a working density of about 0.01
25  g/cm 3, 0.02 g/cm 3, 0.03 g/cm 3, 0.04 g/cm 3, 0.05 g/cm 3, 0.06 g/cm 3, 0.07 g/cm 3, 0.08
    g/cm 3, 0.9 g/cm 3 or 0. 1g/cm 3. In one embodiment the powder has a working density of
    about 0.01 g/cm 3 to 0.1 g/cm   3
                                      and preferably about 0.02 g/cm   3
                                                                         and 0.08 g/cm 3 .
            The term "working density" as used herein is interchangeable with the term "bulk
    density" and is defined herein as the weight of the powder (m) divided by the volume it
30  occupies (Vo) and is expressed herein as grams per liter (g/L) as determined by
    measurement in a graduated cylinder. Briefly, a graduated cylinder is first weighed,
    filled with powder without compacting, leveled if necessary without compacting and
    weighed again. The unsettled apparent volume is read to the nearest graduated unit. The
                                                   -4-

    working density is calculated by the formula m/Vo. Working density may also be
    expressed for example in grams per cubic centimeter (g/cm 3). In one embodiment the
    working density is less than 0.1 g/cm 3 . In one embodiment the working density ranges
    from about 0.01 g/cm 3 to about 0.1 g/cm 3 . In one embodiment the working density
 5  ranges from about 0.02 g/cm3 to about 0.08 g/cm 3 and preferably from about 0.02 g/cm 3
    to about 0.05 g/cm 3 .
            In one embodiment, the capsules contain powder with a working density between
    about 0.03 g/cm 3 to about 0.06 g/cm 3. In another embodiment, the capsules contain
    powder with a working density between about 0.04 g/cm 3 to about 0.05 g/cm 3. In a
10  further embodiment, the capsules contain powder with a working density of about 0.04
    g/cm 3. In a further embodiment, the capsules contain powder with a working density of
    about 0.045 g/cm 3 . In a further embodiment, the capsules contain powder with a
    working density of about 0.05 g/cm 3. In a further embodiment, the capsules contain
    powder with a working density of about 0.035 g/cm 3. In a further embodiment, the
15  capsules contain powder with a working density of about 0.03 g/cm 3 . In one
    embodiment, the capsules contain powder with a working density between about 0.03
    g/cm 3 to about 0.05 g/cm 3. In another embodiment, the capsules contain powder with a
    working density between about 0.04 g/cm 3 to about 0.06 g/cm 3 . In another embodiment,
    the capsules contain powder with a working density between about 0.05 g/cm 3 to about
20  0.06 g/cm3. In another embodiment, the capsules contain powder with a working density
    between about 0.06 g/cm 3 to about 0.07 g/cm 3 .
            The inhalable powder contained in the capsules of the invention comprises at
    least 50% by weight levodopa by weight of solids in the powder. In some embodiments,
    the inhalable powder in a capsule of this invention may contain at least 60%, 70%, 80%,
25  90% by dry weight or more levodopa. In one embodiment the inhalable powder contains
    about 75% by dry weight or more levodopa. In one embodiment, the inhalable powder
    contains about 85% by dry weight by weight or more levodopa. In one embodiment the
    inhalable powder in the capsule contains about 90% by dry weight by weight or more
    levodopa. In one embodiment, the inhalable powder in the capsule contains between 80
30  95% by dry weight levodopa of solids in the powder. In one embodiment, the inhalable
    powder in the capsule contains between 85-95% by dry weight levodopa of solids in the
    powder. In one embodiment, the inhalable powder in the capsule contains between 88
    92% by dry weight levodopa of solids in the powder.

             The inhalation powder may contain additional excipients. Examples of
    excipients include salts such as sodium chloride (NaCl), sodium citrate, sodium lactate,
    and potassium chloride and phospholipids such as dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine
    (DPPC) dilauroylphosphatidylcholine (DLPC), disaturated-phosphatidylcholine
 5  (DSPC). In one embodiment, the capsule contains a powder comprising 90% levodopa,
    8% dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine, and 2% sodium chloride as measured by % of solids
    in the powder. In one embodiment the capsule contains an inhalable powder having a
    dry weight ratio of 90:8:2 of levodopa:DPPC:NaCl. In another embodiment the capsule
    contains an inhalable powder having a dry weight ratio of 90:5:5 of
10  levodopa:DPPC:NaCl.
             The capsules of the invention comprising the inhalable powders are useful for
    delivery of levodopa to the pulmonary system, in particular to the deep lung. The
    inhalable powder contained in the capsule of the invention is characterized by a fine
    particle fraction (FPF), geometric and aerodynamic dimensions and by other properties,
15  as further described below.
             Gravimetric analysis, using Cascade impactors, is a method of measuring the size
    distribution of airborne particles. The Andersen Cascade Impactor (ACI) is an eight
    stage impactor that can separate aerosols into nine distinct fractions based on
    aerodynamic size. The size cutoffs of each stage are dependent upon the flow rate at
20  which the ACI is operated. Preferably the ACI is calibrated at 60 L/min. In one
    embodiment, a two-stage collapsed ACI is used for particle optimization. The two-stage
    collapsed ACI consists of stages 0, 2 and F of the eight-stage ACI and allows for the
    collection of two separate powder fractions. At each stage an aerosol stream passes
    through the nozzles and impinges upon the surface. Particles in the aerosol stream with a
25  large enough inertia will impact upon the plate. Smaller particles that do not have enough
    inertia to impact on the plate will remain in the aerosol stream and be carried to the next
    stage.
             The ACI is calibrated so that the fraction of powder that is collected on a first
    stage is referred to herein as "fine particle fraction" or "FPF". The FPF corresponds to
30  the percentage of particles that have an aerodynamic diameter of less than 5.6 pm. The
    fraction of powder that passed the first stage of the ACI and is deposited on the
    collection filter is referred to as "FPF(3.4)". This corresponds to the percentage of
    particles having an aerodynamic diameter of less than 3.4 pm.
                                                   -6-

             The FPF fraction has been demonstrated to correlate to the fraction of the powder
    that is deposited in the lungs of the patient, while the FPF(3.4) has been demonstrated to
    correlate to the fraction of the powder that reaches the deep lung of a patient. In
    accordance with the invention, the FPF of the inhalable powder of the nominal dose
 5  contained in the capsule (i.e. the percentage of particles in the powder contained in the
    capsule that have an aerodynamic diameter of less than 5.6 pm) is about 40% or more.
    In one embodiment the FPF of the nominal dose of the inhalable powder contained in the
    capsule is about 50%, 6 0%, or 70%, or 8 0%, or 9 0%. In one embodiment the FPF is
    about 50% to about 60% of the nominal dose of the inhalable powder contained in the
                                                                   6
10  inhaler. In one embodiment the FPF is about 55% to about         5% of the nominal dose of
    the inhalable powder contained in the inhaler. In one embodiment the FPF is about 50%
    to about 70% of the nominal dose of the inhalable powder contained in the inhaler. In
                                                        62
    one embodiment the FPF is about 57% to about           % of the nominal dose of the inhalable
    powder contained in the inhaler. In one embodiment the FPF is about 50% to about 69%
15  of the nominal dose of the inhalable powder contained in the inhaler. In one
    embodiment the FPF is about 50%, 51%, 52%, 53%, 54%, 55%, 56%, 57%, 58%, 59%,
                 62
    6 %
      0  , 6 1%,    %, 6 3 %, 6 4 %, or 6 5% of the nominal dose of the inhalable powder
    contained in the inhaler.
             As used herein, the term "nominal powder dose" is the total amount of powder
20  held in the capsule. As used herein, the term "nominal drug dose" is the total amount of
    Levodopa contained in the nominal powder dose. The nominal powder dose is related to
    the nominal drug dose by the load percent of drug in the powder.
             In one embodiment, the nominal powder dose is 25-50 mg by dry weight. In a
    further embodiment, the nominal powder dose is 25-40 mg by dry weight. In a still
25  further embodiment, the nominal powder dose is 30-35 mg by dry weight or 32-38 mg
    by dry weight.
             Another method for measuring the size distribution of airborne particles is the
    multi-stage liquid impinger (MSLI). The Multi-stage liquid Impinger (MSLI) operates on
    the same principles as the Anderson Cascade Impactor (ACI), but instead of eight stages
30  there are five in the MSLI. Additionally, instead of each stage consisting of a solid plate,
    each MSLI stage consists of a methanol-wetted glass frit. The wetted stage is used to
    prevent bouncing and re-entrainment, which can occur using the ACI. The MSLI is used
    to provide an indication of the flow rate dependence of the powder. This can be
                                                   -7-

  WO 2014/074795                                                               PCT/US2013/069102
    accomplished by operating the MSLI at 30, 60, and 90 L/min and measuring the fraction
    of the powder collected on stage 1 and the collection filter. If the fractions on each stage
    remain relatively constant across the different flow rates then the powder is considered to
    be approaching flow rate independence.
 5           In one embodiment, the inhalable powders of the invention have a tap density of
    less than about 0.4 g/cm 3. For example, the particles have a tap density less than about
    0.3 g/cm 3, or a tap density less than about 0.2 g/cm 3, a tap density less than about 0.1
    g/cm 3. Tap density can be measured by using instruments known to those skilled in the
    art such as the Dual Platform Microprocessor Controlled Tap Density Tester (Vankel,
10  N.C.) or a GEOPYC      TM  instrument (Micrometrics Instrument Corp., Norcross, GA,
    30093). Tap density is a standard measure of the envelope mass density. Tap density can
    be determined using the method of USP Bulk Density and Tapped Density, United States
    Pharmacopia convention, Rockville, Md., 10 Supplement, 4950-4951, 1999. Features
    which can contribute to low tap density include irregular surface texture and porous
15  structure. The envelope mass density of an isotropic particle is defined as the mass of
    the particle divided by the minimum sphere envelope volume within which it can be
    enclosed. In one embodiment of the invention, the particles have an envelope mass
    density of less than about 0.4 g/cm 3.
             The inhalable powder of the invention has a preferred particle size, e.g., a volume
20  median geometric diameter (VMGD) of at least about 1 micron (pm). The diameter of
    the spray-dried particles, for example, the VMGD, can be measured using a laser
    diffraction instrument (for example Helos, manufactured by Sympatec, Princeton, N.J.).
    Other instruments for measuring particle diameter are well known in the art. The
    diameter of particles in a sample will range depending upon factors such as particle
25  composition and methods of synthesis. The distribution of size of particles in a sample
    can be selected to permit optimal deposition to targeted sites within the respiratory tract.
             The particles of the inhalable powder of the invention preferably have a "mass
    median aerodynamic diameter" (MMAD), also referred to herein as "aerodynamic
    diameter", between about 1 pm and about 5 pm or any subrange encompassed between
30  about 1 pm and about 5 pm. For example, but not limited to, the MMAD is between
    about 1 pm and about 3 pm, or the MMAD is between about 3 pm and about 5 pm.
    Experimentally, aerodynamic diameter can be determined by employing a gravitational

    distance is used to infer directly the aerodynamic diameter of the particles. An indirect
    method for measuring the mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) is the multi

    where d9 is the geometric diameter, for example the MMGD, and p is the powder density.
            In one embodiment, the particles have a mass mean geometric diameter (MMGD)
    of between about 5 pim and about 18 pim. In another embodiment, the particles have a
10  mass mean geometric diameter (MMGD) of between about 5 pim and about 12 pim. In
    another embodiment, the particles have a mass mean geometric diameter (MMGD) of
    between about 8 pim and about 10 pim. In another embodiment, the particles have a mass
    mean geometric diameter (MMGD) of between about 8 pim and about 15 pim.
            Powders for use in capsules of this invention are typically produced by spray
15  drying. In some cases, spray-drying can produce extremely dry particles which may
    have poor handling properties and may be difficult to compact into a capsule in a dense
    manner. A nitrogen source with a specified moisture level may be flown over, across, or
    through the dry powder to add a specific moisture content to the dry powder. Such
    moisture can provide the desired working density of the powder. Spray drying methods
20  in accordance with the invention are described in the Examples herein and in U.S. Patent
    Numbers: 6,848,197 and 8,197,845, incorporated herein by reference.
            The inhalable powder comprising levodopa as described above is used to fill
    capsules suitable for use in an inhaler. The term "capsule material" as used herein refers
    to the material from which the shell of the capsule for inhalation is made. The shell of
25  the capsule is also referred to herein as the "capsule shell" or the "capsule's shell". In
    one embodiment, the capsule material according to the invention is selected from among
    gelatin, cellulose derivatives, starch, starch derivatives, chitosan and synthetic plastics.
            If gelatin is used as the capsule material, examples according to the invention
    may be selected from among polyethyleneglycol (PEG), PEG 3350, glycerol, sorbitol,
30  propyleneglycol, PEO-PPO block copolymers and other polyalcohols and polyethers. If
    cellulose derivatives are used as the capsule material, examples according to the
    invention may be selected from hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC),
    hydroxypropylcellulose, methylcellulose, hydroxymethylcellulose and

    hydroxyethylcellulose. If synthetic plastics are used as the capsule material, examples
    according to the invention may be selected from polyethylene, polycarbonate, polyester,
    polypropylene and polyethylene terephthalate. In one embodiment, the capsule material
    further comprises titanium dioxide. In one preferred embodiment the capsule comprises
 5  HPMC and titanium dioxide. In one embodiment, the capsule comprises carrageenan.
    In a further embodiment, the capsule comprises potassium chloride. In a still further
    embodiment, the capsule comprises, HPMC, carrageenan, potassium chloride, and
    titanium dioxide .In one embodiment, the capsule size is selected from 000, 00, 0, 1, or 2.
    In a specific embodiment, the capsule size is 00.
10          In one specific embodiment, the capsule is a hydroxypropylmethylcellulose
    (HPMC) capsule. In another specific embodiment, the capsule is a
    hydroxypropylmethylcellulose size 00 capsule. In one specific embodiment the capsule
    material comprises HPMC and titanium dioxide and the capsule size is 00.
            In one embodiment, a 00 capsule contains between 15 and 50 grams of levodopa
15  by dry weight. In another embodiment, a 00 capsule contains between 20 and 40 grams
    of levodopa by dry weight. In another embodiment, a 00 capsule contains between 25
    and 35 grams of levodopa by dry weight. In another embodiment, a 00 capsule contains
    about 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, or 40 grams of levodopa by dry weight.
            In one aspect of the invention, the powders have low electrostatic charge to
20  enable high dispersion from the capsule.
            The invention further provides a method and dosator apparatus for dispensing
    low density, high flowing powders into capsules at high target fill weights with accuracy
    and repeatability. Referring to FIG. 4, the dosator 20 of the invention is described The
    dosator of the invention is also referred to herein as the "full bore dosator" because the
25  inner diameter of the dosator chamber as measured at the mesh screen 26 is large,
    approximately 0.280 to 0.315 inches and is preferably 0.286 inches. This is larger than
    the inner diameter of the dosator chamber of a standard size dosator which typically has
    a diameter of 0.250 inches. The larger inner diameter of the dosator chamber of the
    dosator of the present invention allows more powder to be held due to the pressure drop
30  through the powder.

             Continuing to refer to FIG. 4, the dosator 20 is preferably in the form of a tube
    which tapers from the top 50 of the dosator to the bottom 56 of the dosator and has an
    axial passage therein forming an elongate cavity. A stationary plunger 22 is disposed
    within the cavity. A removable mesh screen 26 having an area that is equal to Id 2/4
 5  (wherein d is the inner diameter of the dosator chamber as measured at the mesh screen)
    and a mesh size that is smaller than the mass median diameter (D50 ) of the dry powder is
    disposed between the stationary plunger 22 and the bottom 56 of the dosator. A dosator
    chamber 27 of a predetermined height is defined by the space between the mesh screen
    26 and the bottom 56 of the dosator for receiving powder from a powder source and
10  holding the powder until it is expelled into the capsule. In one embodiment, the height
    of the dosator chamber is in the range of 5 mm to 20 mm. The height of the dosator
    chamber may be chosen to accommodate the required fill weight of the capsule. At least
    one vacuum pump is operably linked to the dosator via a linking means such as a port 24,
    and is capable of drawing dry powder into the dosator chamber 27 from a powder source
15  and compacting the powder into a slug of powder having a predetermined bulk density
    prior to expelling the slug of powder into a capsule. And, at least one source of positive
    pressure operably linked to the dosator and capable of providing positive pressure to
    expel the powder slug from the dosator.
             The mesh screen 26 is designed to be removable and replaceable and to allow
20  powders to be filled based on geometry and traits. A mesh screen 26 is needed to prevent
    powder from traveling up towards the vacuum pump operably linked to the dosator and
    clogging the system. This maintains constant vacuum throughout the course of a filling
    run, which keeps the accuracy at the target fill weight. If powder was to pass the mesh
    screen 26, fill weights would continue to drop as the filling run progresses. The mesh
25  size of the screen 26 is smaller than the D50 of the given powder to ensure powder does
    not clog the lines. If the particle size is larger, a larger mesh can be used to minimize the
    resistance and therefore maximize fill weights. In one embodiment the mesh screen is a
    2 micron mesh screen. In one embodiment, the mesh screen is a 5 micron mesh screen.
             In one embodiment, the dosator 20 is operably linked to at least one vacuum
30   pump. In one embodiment the dosator is operably linked to at least two vacuum pumps.
     The dosator 20 may be linked to one or more vacuum pumps via, for example, one or
     more ports 24.

             In one embodiment the dosator 20 is operably linked to a positive pressure source
     suitable for applying positive pressure to expel a slug from the dosator chamber 27 into
     a capsule. In one embodiment the positive pressure source is a nitrogen containing
     source such as a nitrogen tank.
 5           Referring now to FIG. 5, to operate the full bore dosator of the invention, powder
     is loaded into hopper and is conveyed to bowl 52 via an auger to remove air and
     maintain powder bed height 51 throughout the filling run. The bed height 51 is
     maintained at a height double the stroke height of the dosator. As used herein the
     phrase "stroke height" means the measure from the bottom 56 of the dosator to the mesh
10   screen 26.
             The manifold 60 is common to both negative and positive pressure systems used.
     In one embodiment, vacuum is generated by two vacuum pumps to achieve a pressure
     of--latm (-98KPa). The low pressure creates a large pressure differential (AP) across
     the mesh screen 26.
15           In accordance with the invention a large vacuum and large bore design, can allow
     high fill weights be achieved for the given powders. Once the dosator 20 filled with
     powder is aligned over the capsule 62, preferably a size 00 capsule, the manifold 60 is
     transitioned to positive pressure to expel the slug 64 from the dosator into the capsule
     62. As used herein the term "slug" refers to the compacted powder after the vacuum
20   has been applied through the dosator as shown in FIG. 5 element 64. The "push"
     pressure generated is just enough to remove powder from the dosator 20. Too much
     pressure results in the slug 64 being broken up and expelled from the capsule 62 due to
     the density and flowability of the powder. Too little pressure results in the slug 64 not
     being fully expelled from the dosator.
25           The bed height, vacuum and push pressure allow the high fill weight to be
     achieved. The accuracy is achieved by adjusting the stroke height, which makes small
     adjustments back to the intended fill weight.
             The advantages of the improved dosator of the invention is that the vacuum
     dosing arrangement allows for low density, high flowing particles (e.g. particles that do
30   not adhere to each other) to be filed at high target fill weights with accuracy and
     repeatability. The relative standard deviation (RSD) for the levodopa powders such as
     the 90:8:2 levodopa:DPPC:NaCl powder fill per each run is less than 4% for a 32 mg
     capsule fill using a 00 capsule. The high vacuum used, ~-1 atmospheres, compacts the
                                                 - 12 -

     low density powder to allow as much as about 50 mg of powder to be filled into a size
     00 HPMC capsule. FIG. 6 is a table showing exemplary technical specifications for
     various gelatin capsules used in accordance with the dosator of the invention.
             Therefore, in one embodiment, the invention comprises a method of filling a
 5   capsule using the dosator of the invention, the method comprising the steps of: creating
     a low pressure vacuum within the dosator; positioning the dosator in a bowl filled with
     powder and drawing the powder into the dosator chamber; maintaining the powder in
     the dosator chamber with the low pressure vacuum to form a slug of powder having a
     predetermined bulk density and expelling the slug of powder into a capsule.
10           In one embodiment, the bulk density of the powder slug is between about 0.02
     g/cm 3 to about 0.05 g/cm 3. In one embodiment, the capsule is a 00 size capsule. In one
     embodiment the powder slug comprises between about 15 and 50 milligrams of powder.
     In one embodiment the powder slug comprises between about 25 and 35 milligrams of
     powder.
15           In one embodiment at least one vacuum pump achieves a pressure of about -1
     atmosphere (atm). In one embodiment, at least two vacuum pumps achieve a pressure
     of about -I atm.
             In one embodiment, the diameter of the dosator chamber a measured at the mesh
     screen is between 0.280 and 0.315 inches. In one embodiment, the diameter of the
20   dosator chamber as measured at the mesh screen is 0.286 inches. In one embodiment,
     the hopper is filled with powder to achieve a bed height that is twice the stroke height of
     the dosator.
             In one embodiment, the dosator fills a 00 capsule with about 25 to 50 mg of
     powder. In one embodiment, the dosator fills the 00 capsule with at least 30 mg of dry
25   powder.
             In one embodiment, the dosator fills 2 or more 00 capsules with about 30 mg or
     more of dry powder wherein the relative standard deviation in the amount of powder
     filled in all capsules is less than 4%.
             The capsules of the invention are particularly suitable for use in a dry powder
30   inhaler for the delivery of a dry powder composition comprising levodopa to a patient
     afflicted with, for example, Parkinson's disease and in need of treatment with levodopa.
     The patient in need of treatment may require maintenance therapy for Parkinson's
     disease or rescue therapy for Parkinson's disease such as would be necessary in the case

     of an acute and/or freezing episode due to Parkinson's disease. In one embodiment, the
     capsules are used in a dry powder inhaler to deliver an effective amount of the dry
     powder composition to the patient in a single breath as is described in U.S. Patent
     Numbers, 6,858,199 and 7,556,798 incorporated herein by reference.
 5           As used herein, the term "effective amount" means the amount needed to achieve
     the desired effect or efficacy. The actual effective amounts of drug can vary according
     to the specific drug or combination thereof being utilized, the particular composition
     formulated, the mode of administration, and the age, weight, condition of the patient,
     and severity of the episode being treated. In the case of a dopamine precursor, agonist or
10   combination thereof it is an amount which reduces the Parkinson's symptoms which
     require therapy. Dosages for a particular patient are described herein and can be
     determined by one of ordinary skill in the art using conventional considerations, (e.g. by
     means of an appropriate, conventional pharmacological protocol). For example,
     effective amounts of oral levodopa range from about 50 milligrams (mg) to about 500
15   mg. In many instances, a common ongoing (oral) levodopa treatment schedule is 100
     mg eight (8) times a day.
             The administration of more than one dopamine precursor, agonist or combination
     thereof, in particular levodopa, carbidopa, apomorphine, and other drugs can be
     provided, either simultaneously or sequentially in time. Carbidopa or benserazide, for
20   example, is often administered to ensure that peripheral carboxylase activity is
     completely shut down. Intramuscular, subcutaneous, oral and other administration
     routes can be employed. In one embodiment, these other agents are delivered to the
     pulmonary system. These compounds or compositions can be administered before, after
     or at the same time. In a preferred embodiment, particles that are administered to the
25   respiratory tract include both Levodopa and carbidopa. The term "co-administration" is
     used herein to mean that the specific dopamine precursor, agonist or combination
     thereof and/or other compositions are administered at times to treat the episodes, as well
     as the underlying conditions described herein.
             In one embodiment chronic levodopa therapy includes the use of the capsules of
30   the invention in a dry powder inhaler for pulmonary delivery of levodopa combined
     with oral carbidopa. In another embodiment, pulmonary delivery of levodopa is
     provided during the episode, while chronic treatment can employ conventional oral
     administration of levodopa/carbidopa. In a further embodiment chronic levodopa

             The present invention will be further understood by reference to the following
    non-limiting examples.
    EXAMPLES
10  Example 1
             This example summarizes a series of studies examining modifications performed
    on the spray drying operation for the production of a 90:8:2
    levodopa:dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC):sodium chloride (NaCl) composition
    referred to herein as "90:8:2". The 90:8:2 spray drying operation that was developed for
15  the production of initial lots of powders containing levodopa involved the production of
    a 90:8:2 levodopa: DPPC: NaCl powder that was fully amorphous with a water content
    of approximately 4%, a fine particle fraction in the range of 50-60% < 5.4 microns and a
    maximum capsule fill weight of approximately 23 mg per size 00 capsule. This
    combination of properties resulted in a maximum delivered dose of levodopa (fine
20  particle mass of levodopa) of approximately 12 mg per capsule, with these powders
    exhibiting a high degree of electrostatic charging and low bulk (typically 0.01 - 0.02
    g/cc) and tap density (typically 0.02 - 0.04 g/cc), which made it extremely difficult to fill
    these powders reproducibly into size 00 capsules. Based on this, it was desired to attempt
    to increase the delivered dose of levodopa per capsule to 17 mg or greater. Additionally,
25  it was desired to increase the physical stability of the 90:8:2 powders, as some powder
    lots were also observed to undergo an amorphous to crystalline conversion upon storage,
    particularly for lots that were filled under conditions for which the laboratory humidity
    was not controlled, thus potentially exposing these lots to elevated humidity.
             During the spray drying operation, powder collected on the filter bags in the
30  product filter is exposed to the moisture-laden environment of the product filter because
    of water vapor moving from the spray drying unit towards the exhaust across the product
    filter bags. When this powder is pulsed off the filter bags for collection, it tends to retain
    the residual moisture that it picked up in the product filter, which may act to facilitate a
                                                 - 15 -

  WO 2014/074795                                                             PCT/US2013/069102
    solid-state conversion from an amorphous to a crystalline form, either immediately or at
    some point during storage. To prevent this conversion, the powder must be dried
    effectively prior to collection, which is achieved by introducing dry nitrogen as a purge
    stream between the product filter and the collection vessel. However, during this drying
 5  operation, the powder becomes electrostatically charged, possibly due to bone dry
    conditions of the incoming nitrogen purge gas. This electrostatic charge decreases the
    bulk density of the powder, which in-turn decreases the amount of powder that can be
    filled in a capsule hence reducing the fine particle mass (FPM) per capsule. The methods
    and modifications indicated below were performed and evaluated for their ability to
10  increase the FPM by eliminating the electrostatic charge on the powder and/or increasing
    the bulk density of the powder without predisposing the powder to solid-state
    conversion.
             The studies described herein were thus conducted with the goals of (1)
    optimizing the fine particle mass (FPM) per capsule, (2) increasing the capsule fill
15  weight and (3) stabilizing the amorphous solid state structure of bulk spray dried 90:8:2.
    Process parameter, unit operation and formulation modifications were executed and
    evaluated for their effectiveness in achieving endpoints (1-3).
      Types of Modifications
20           Three types of modifications, (1) unit operation modifications, (2) process
    parameter modifications and (3) formulation modifications were evaluated.
      (1) Unit operation modifications
             Two types of unit operation modifications were studied, (i) the use of humidified
25  purge gas and (ii) in-line ionization. Of these two, the use of humidified purge gas
    showed the best results with respect to decreasing electrostatic charge and increasing the
    maximum fill weight of the capsules. The details of this modification are described
    below.
             Exposure to a humid environment helps decrease the static charge stored on a
30  material because moisture in the air increases the conductivity of air, thereby enabling
    gas discharge. Since the dry nitrogen used as the purge gas to dry the powder was
    thought to be the primary cause for generation of the electrostatic charge on the 90:8:2
    powder humidification of the purge gas may allow for charge dissipation and help
                                                 - 16-

  WO 2014/074795                                                               PCT/US2013/069102
    eliminate the electrostatic charge stored on the surface of the powder particles. This can
    act to increase the bulk density, which will in-turn increase the fine particle mass per
    capsule.
             Humidification of the purge gas was carried out using two types of purge inlet
 5  setups (i) a standard inlet setup as shown in FIG. 2A, in which the purge gas entered the
    product filter horizontally in at the bottom of the product filter and (ii) an angled inlet
    setup as shown in FIG. 2B, in which the purge gas enters the product filter at an angle to
    the vertical axis at the bottom of the product filter.
             In a standard configuration, the powder pulsed off the product filter bags has
10  contact with the dry purge gas for only a fraction of a second due to the narrow stream of
    purge gas entering in such a setup. By changing the angle of the purge gas inlet, as in the
    angled inlet configuration, one can increase the exposure time for powder pulsed off the
    bags to incoming dry purge gas. This setup may help more efficient elimination static
    charging as compared to a humidifying purge gas coming in through a standard
15  horizontal inlet, which in turn may increase the fine particle mass and decrease the
    electrostatic charging of the powder.
             Referring to FIG. 1, humidification of the purge gas was carried out by passing
    the gas through a pressure pot 1 filled with water 2 for irrigation. A bypass line 3 with a
    control valve 8 was attached in parallel with the pressure pot 1. By controlling the ratio
20  of the amount of nitrogen that passes through the pressure pot 1 to the amount that
    bypasses it, one can control the resulting relative humidity (RH) of the purge gas.
    Humidity of the exiting purge gas was measured using a dew-point meter 4 attached in
    series downstream of the humidification pressure pot 1 apparatus.
             The purge gas is then passed through rotameter 5 which functions to control the
25  flow of the purge gas to the product filter and facilitates adjusting the water content of
    the final powder. Butterfly valve 31 functions to isolate the product filter from the
    environment when the collection vessel 7 is changed. Butterfly valve 32 functions to
    isolate the collection vessel from the environment during the product transfer step from
    the collection vessel into a holding container which is stored at optimized temperature
30  and relative humidity.
             The humidified purge gas was then introduced at the bottom of the product filter
    apparatus 6 through (i) standard horizontal purge inlet (FIG. 2A), or (ii) angled purge
    inlet setup (FIG. 2B).

              In an angled inlet setup (FIG. 2B), a directional inlet 9 for the purge gas stream
     was used, as opposed to a standard horizontal inlet 10 (FIG. 2A). This directional inlet 9
     can be rotated along its own axis, and can hence be directed towards either the product
     filter 6 or the collection vessel 7 as shown in FIG. 1 and FIGs. 3A-D.
 5            Directional inlet 9 configurations used included: downward 0' (FIG. 3A),
     upwards 0' (FIG. 3B), downwards angled 25-30' (FIG. 3C) and upwards angled 25 - 30'
     (FIG. 3D) with items in parenthesis indicating the angle to the vertical axis of the
     product filter.
             Additionally, with the purge gas inlet at 0' to the vertical axis, different
10     atomization gas flow (25 g/min to 55 g/min) rates were evaluated.
     Experimental conditions
              Purge gas was humidified to different relative humidity levels. Rotameter for
     purge gas inlet was set to 3.5 g / min or 20 scfh.

             However, visual observation of the powders indicated that the powders were much
     denser compared to the standard powder. Additionally, X-ray powder diffraction
     (XRPD) analysis of these powders showed evidence of crystalline peaks starting to form
     for the powders produced with purge gas humidities in excess of 10%. It is expected that

    this initial amount of crystalline phase will act to catalyze further recrystallization of
    these powders upon storage, which has been observed to result in undesirable decreases
    in FPF and water content. Thus, it was determined that a purge gas humidification in the
    range of 5-10% RH was optimal with respect to decreasing the electrostatic charge of the
 5  spray-dried powders utilizing the standard setup.

             Visually, all powders except for the one produced with downward angled
 5  orientation appeared to be much denser and to possess a relatively less amount of
    electrostatic charge as compared to the powders produced with the standard purge gas
    inlet orientation.
    Results
             Although humidification of the purge gas was observed to make the powders
10  denser while keeping the FPF and water content the same, these formulations were
    observed in some cases to display evidence of the formation of a crystalline phase via
    XRPD, in particular for purge gas humidities in excess of 10%. As a result, the use of
    purge gas humidified to greater than 10% RH was determined to not be a viable option,
    with the use of a purge gas relative humidity in the range of 5 to 10% providing a
15  mechanism for reducing powder electrostatic charge and increasing powder density
    without decreasing powder FPF or causing an amorphous to crystalline conversion.
    (2) Formulation Modifications
             Alternative formulations        to the 90:8:2 levodopa:DPPC:NaCl powder were

    Modification of DPPC: Sodium chloride ratio
             Powders having an alternate ratio of DPPC:NaCl were evaluated for their
    efficiency in increasing the density and reducing electrostatic charging of the 90%
    levodopa powders. It was hypothesized that increasing the salt content of the powders
 5  could potentially act to help dissipate and thus reduce their electrostatic charge.
    Experimental design:
            A DPPC:NaCl ratio of 4:6 was initially selected as a starting point to evaluate the
    influence of a higher amount of sodium chloride on the FPF and density of the 90:8:2
10  powders. Purge gas relative humidities were maintained at both 0% and 10%.
    Results:

    levodopa:DPPC:NaCl powders made using similar conditions (typically 0.02 g/cc for
20  bulk density and 0.04 g/cc for tap density). Since this trial produced favorable bulk and
    tap density results along with favorable results for FPF and gPSD, a decision was made
    to evaluate additional alternative DPPC:NaCl ratios of 2:8 and 6:4 and compare the
    results to 4:6 and control (8:2) powders. Results for powders produced utilizing the

    potential route towards optimizing the FPM and bulk density of 90:8:2 powders. The
10  excipients 1-leucine, sodium citrate and calcium chloride, which were available in-house,
    were used and evaluated as additives or as substitutes to the excipients currently in the

             Sodium citrate was evaluated as a potential alternative to Sodium chloride,
15  Calcium chloride was investigated as another potential salt additive to the current
    formulation and -leucine was evaluated as a potential alternative to DPPC. When

    Discussion
            Although addition of -leucine increased the tap and bulk densities of the powder,
    the FPF was significantly lower than that of the standard 90:8:2 levodopa:DPPC:NaCl
 5  formulation.
            Substitution of sodium chloride by sodium citrate in the same ratio produced a
    capsule fill weight of 27.3 mg. An XRPD analysis of the powder concluded that it
    maintained its amorphous state. However, no other tests could be performed, as the yield
    was significantly low.
10          Addition of sodium citrate and calcium chloride, in addition to increasing the
    load of DPPC and reducing the load of Levodopa (50:25:15:10
    Levodopa:DPPC:NaCitrate:CaCl 2) was observed to increase the FPF of the powder to
    65%. However, XRPD analysis of the powder concluded the presence crystal growth.
15  Example 2 Optimization of capsule filling operations
            The standard 90:8:2 formulation powder is a low density powder with a high
    electrostatic charge. Because of the high volume which the low density 90:8:2 powders
    occupies, the amount of powder which can be filled into a capsule without affecting its
    aerodynamic performance is greatly limited. When such a low density powder has a high
20  electrostatic charge, a high degree of variability can be seen in the fill weights of
    capsules due to the constant interaction of the charged powder with the walls of the
    capsules and the filling equipment. Capsule filling operations for such a powder, which
    displays a low fill weight and high weight variability at the same time, presented a set of
    unique challenges, all of which necessitated filling equipment modifications which
25  helped achieve the fill weight goals without affecting the physical and chemical
    properties of the powder.
            This example summarizes the experiments and modifications carried out the
    optimize the powder filling operations conducted using the Harro Hbfliger KFM III-C
    capsule filling machine for filling 90:8:2 powders into size 00 capsules.
30          Different KFM III-C variables and formulation compositions were evaluated
    under different vacuum configurations for their effectiveness in achieving an optimal and
    reproducible fill weight with different 90:8:2 formulations. Three vacuum
    configurations were used (i) no vacuum to the dosators, (ii) Use of pre-installed KFM
                                                -24-

     vacuum to the dosators, and (iii) Use of external vacuum to the dosators. For the 90:8:2
     active powders, an external vacuum assisted size 00 full-bore vacuum dosator was
     determined to be the optimal configuration in order to achieve accurate and reproducible
     fill weights on the KFM III-C capsule filling machine. The analysis of this set up is
 5   described below.
     Filling with the use of external vacuum on dosator
              In this vacuum setup, a Gast vacuum pump (model # 1023-101Q-G608X) was
     used as a vacuum for the dosators instead of the vacuum on-board the KFM machine.
10            Dosator configurations and formulation variables that were evaluated for capsule
     filling accuracy and reproducibility using the external vacuum included:

20            For this experiment, the standard size 00 dosator was used to fill powder obtained
     by spray drying a 90:4:6 levodopa:DPPC:NaCl formulation. The variables evaluated for
     fill weight accuracy in this experiment included - (i) leveling blade versus platform for
     the powder bed, and (ii) low versus high powder bed height. The results for this
     experiment are summarized in Table 9 below.

    Full bore size 00 vacuum dosator with 90:8:2 and 90:5:5 levodopa:DPPC:NaCl
20           Referring now to FIG. 4, a full bore dosator 20 is a standard vacuum dosator
    which has been modified to increase the inner diameter of the dosator chamber at the
    mesh screen 26 to 0.286 inches as compared to 0.250 inches which is the typical inner
    diameter of a standard dosator chamber. The dosator 20 was also modified in such a
    way that the dosator plunger 22 stays stationary, and powder is pulled into the dosator 20
                                                       -26-

  WO 2014/074795                                                                      PCT/US2013/069102
    by applying a vacuum and expelled out of the dosator 20 by applying expulsion pressure
    as illustrated in the schematic of FIG. 5. Vacuum was generated by means of a pump
    attached to the dosator 20 at the port 24 with appropriate tubing. A two (2) micron mesh
    screen 26 was added at the bottom of the plunger 22 to prevent powder from crossing
 5  over and interfering with the vacuum pump and tubing. Expulsion pressure was
    provided by means of compressed nitrogen sourced from an external storage tank.
             In this experiment, a full bore vacuum dosator was used for filling 90:8:2 powder
    which was produced using a nitrogen gas overlay on the aqueous phase. As discussed
    previously, the 90:5:5 90:8:2 powder formulations were observed to have almost twice
10  the original fill weights due to increased bulk density and tap density values. Using a
    full-bore vacuum dosator, it was possible to produce similar high fill weights using the
    standard 90:8:2 90:8:2 powder.
             To achieve the target capsule fill weight, the dosator chamber height was dialed
    in against a standard vacuum of -15" Hg, until capsules having sufficient accuracy and
15  reproducibility of the desired fill weight were produced. The temperature of the room
    was maintained around 20'C and the relative humidity of the room was maintained
    around 20% R.H.
             One lot of 90:8:2 levodopa:DPPC:NaCl was filled for a trial fill, followed by
    another lot of the same composition. After these two lots were produced, a third lot with
20  90:5:5 levodopa:DPPC:NaCl was filled. All 3 lots are evaluated for the KFM's
    effectiveness in producing an accurate and reproducible fill weight.
             The results for this experiment are summarized in Table 12 below.

             Previous attempts at filling to 90:8:2 formulations resulted in a maximum fill
    weight of 23 milligrams per capsule. The fill weights obtained using the full bore
    vacuum dosator are significantly greater than the previous attempts. For example, fill

    weights of 28 to 40mg may be achieved. Examples of fill weights include, but are not
    limited to, 28-32mg, 30-34mg, or 35-40mg.
             Full bore size 00 vacuum dosator, size 4 plunging dosator and size 5 plunging
    dosator with lactose monohydrate NF: Lactose monohydrate NF was used as a placebo
 5  for the 90:8:2 formulation. The target fill weight of lactose was 10 mg.
    Conclusion
             Typical filling of large amounts of powder are uncommon for pulmonary
    products. Applicants have identified new parameters and processes which allow for
10  filling large amounts of powder in a capsule for pulmonary delivery. For the 90:8:2
    active powders, an external vacuum assisted size 00 full-bore vacuum dosator can be
    used in order to achieve higher maximum fill weights (up to 38 mg or higher) as
    compared to the previous maximum fill weight of 23 mg seen for the 90:8:2 powder, as
    well as accurate and reproducible fill weights on the KFM III-C capsule filling machine.
15           Additionally, of the three ratios of powders that were evaluated using this setup,
    the powder with an levodopa:DPPC:NaCl ratio of 90:8:2 can be filled much more
    accurately and reproducibly to the target fill weight, as compared to the 90:5:5 and
    90:4:6 ratios.
             For the Lactose placebo powder, an external vacuum assisted size 5 plunger
20  dosator is the setup of choice to achieve the desired target weight accurately and
    reproducibly.
    Example 3-Analysis of capsule materials and emitted dose
             It was hypothesized that certain types of capsules may be useful in increasing the
25  emitted dose of powder. HPMC "clear" capsules and HPMC/ titanium dioxide "white"
    capsules were chosen. Two workstations with an inhaler configured with emitted dose
    tubes were provided. Clear or white capsules were filled to 28 mg with inhalable
    levodopa powder (dry weight ratio of 90:8:2 of levodopa:DPPC: NaCl) prepared in
    accordance with Example 1 to a target load and placed in the inhaler. An analyst was
30  assigned to each station and actuated the inhaler into the ED tube at 28.3 L/min for 4.2
    seconds and rinsed for content. The FPF of the content was measured using standard
    procedures. Analysts also switched work stations and used each other's inhaler
    technique. The results are provided in the following Tables 13-20. Tables 13 and 14

    Discussion
             The data shows that more powder was emitted from the white capsules having a
    capsule material that comprises HPMC and titanium dioxide as compared to the powder
 5  emitted from the clear capsules that do not contain titanium dioxide in the capsule
    material. This data is surprising. Without being limited to any theory, it is believed that
    the titanium dioxide present in the capsule material reduces the amount of powder that
    sticks to the capsule wall upon emptying from the capsule.

    Purpose
             To characterize 90/8/2 and 90/5/5 Levodopa powder in machine filled capsules
    that have been exposed to 75% relative humidity and 25'C conditions for 15, 30 and 60
    minutes using gravimetric ACI-3 and XRPD. Additional time points were added at 240
15  and 360 minutes of exposure, white and clear capsules were tested with lot 41021
    (90/8/2).
    Experimental Design: Samples from Lot 28100 (90/8/2) and Lot 28109 (90/5/5) were
    exposed to pre-stated conditions in a humidity chamber and then immediately analyzed.
