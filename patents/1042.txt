                                             LOSS
   The present application is a divisional application of Australian Application No.
   2014354808, which is incorporated in its entirety herein by reference.
 5 Technical Field of the Invention
   The present invention relates in general to the field of personalized medicine, and more
   particularly, to a novel method and apparatus for selecting atherapy to improve cognitive
   function.
   Background of the Invention
10 Without limiting the scope of the invention, its background is described in connection
   with the treatment of cognitive dysfunctions.
   The detection and evaluation of disease conditions has progressed greatly as a result of
   the sequencing of the human genome and the availability of bioinformatics tools. One
   such system is taught in United States Patent No. 8,430,816, issued to Avinash, et al., for
15 a system and method for analysis of multiple diseases and severities.        Briefly, these
   inventors teach a data processing technique that includes a computer-implemented
   method for accessing reference deviation maps for a plurality of disease types. The
   reference deviation maps may include subsets of maps associated with severity levels of
   respective disease types and a disease severity score may be associated with each
20 severity level. The method is said to also include selecting patient severity levels for
   multiple disease types based on the subsets of reference deviation maps.         Also, the
   method may include automatically calculating a combined patient disease severity score
   based at least in part on the disease severity scores associated with the selected patient
   severity levels, and may include outputting a report based at least in part on the
25 combined patient disease severity score.
   Another such invention, is taught in United States Patent No. 8,008,025, issued to Zhang
   and directed to biomarkers for neurodegenerative disorders.         Briefly, this inventor
   teaches methods for diagnosing neurodegenerative disease, such as Alzheimer's Disease,
   Parkinson's Disease, and dementia with Lewy body disease by detecting a pattern of
30 gene product expression in a cerebrospinal fluid sample and comparing the pattern of

                                            - la
  gene product expression from the sample to a library of gene product expression pattern
  known to be indicative of the presence or absence of a neurodegenerative disease. The
  methods are also said to provide for monitoring neurodegenerative disease progression
  and assessing the effects of therapeutic treatment. Also provided are kits, systems and
5 devices for practicing the subject methods.

                                                     2
   United States Patent Application Publication No. 2013/0012403, filed by Hu is directed to
   compositions and methods for identifying autism spectrum disorders.              This application is
   directed to microRNA chips having a plurality of different oligonucleotides with specificity for
   genes associated with autism spectrum disorders. The invention is said to provide methods of
 5 identifying microRNA profiles for neurological and psychiatric conditions including autism
   spectrum disorders, methods of treating such conditions, and methods of identifying therapeutics
   for the treatment of such neurological and psychiatric conditions.
   Yet another application is United States Patent Application Publication No. 2011/0159527, filed
   by Schlossmacher, et al., for methods and kits for diagnosing neurodegenerative disease.
10 Briefly, the application is said to teach methods and diagnostic kits for determining whether a
   subject may develop or be diagnosed with a neurodegenerative disease. The method is said to
   include quantitating the amount of alpha-synuclein and total protein in a cerebrospinal fluid
   (CSF) sample obtained from the subject and calculating a ratio of alpha-synuclein to total
   protein content; comparing the ratio of alpha-synuclein to total protein content in the CSF
15 sample with the alpha-synuclein to total protein content ratio in CSF samples obtained from
   healthy neurodegenerative disease-free subjects; and determining from the comparison whether
   the subject has a likelihood to develop neurodegenerative disease or making a diagnosis of
   neurodegenerative disease in a subject. It is said that a difference in the ratio of alpha-synuclein
   to total protein content indicates that the subject has a likelihood of developing a
20 neurodegenerative disease or has developed a neurodegenerative disease.
   Summary of the Invention
   In one embodiment, the present invention includes a method for selecting a therapy for improved
   cognition or prevention of cognitive loss using one or more anti-inflammatory therapies
   comprising: obtaining a sample from a subject; measuring one or more biomarkers in the sample
25 selected from at least one of interleukin ([L)-7, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFa), IL-5, IL-6,
   C-reactive protein (CRP), IL-10, tenascin C (TNC), intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM1),
   coagulation factor VII (FVII), 1309, tumor necrosis factor receptor-I (TNFR1), alpha-2
   macroglobulin (A2M), chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 17 (TARC), eotaxin3, vascular cell
   adhesion molecule-I (VCAM1), thrombopoietin (TPO), fatty acid binding protein (FABP), IL
30 18, beta-2 microblogulin (B2M), serum amyloid Al cluster (SAA), pancreatic polypeptide
   (PPY), Parkinson protein 7 (DJ 1), beta amyloid (Ap), tau, or a-synuclein; comparing the level of
   the one or more biomarkers within a sample of patients suffering from cognitive loss; dividing
   the level of expression of the one or more markers as being either high proinflammatory or low

                                                   3
   proinflammatory; and selecting a course of treatment for the subject based on whether the
   subject is selected as being high proinflammatory or low proinflammatory. In one aspect, the
   method further comprises the steps of: generating a high and a low proinflamrnatory
   endophenotype by determining the level of expression of two or more markers selected from
 5 IL7, TNFa, IL5, IL6, CRP, IL10, TNC, ICAMI, FVIl, 1309, TNFRI, A2M, TARC, eotaxin3,
   VCAMI, TPO, FABP, IL18, B2M, SAA, PPY, DJI, Ap, tau, or a-synuclein; and determining
   the high and low proinflammatory groupings by determining the level of expression of the two
   or more biomarkers. In another aspect, the proinflammatory profile is generated using learning
   machines (random forest, support vector machines), clustering algorithms (factor analysis,
10 principal component analysis), summation of values, or other methods to generate a
   proinflammatory score across multiple measures. In another aspect, the high end of the score
   across multiple markers is reflective of the high proinflammatory endophenotype and the low
   end as the low proinflammatory         endophenotype with all others falling in a middle
   endophenotype. In another aspect, if the subject is scored in the high proinflammatory group an
15 anti-inflammatory treatment is indicated, and if the subject is scored in a low proinflammatory
   group then an anti-inflammatory treatment is contraindicated.    In another aspect, at least one of
   the biomarker measurements is obtained by a method selected from the group consisting of
   immunoassay and enzymatic activity assay. In another aspect, the sample is serum or plasma.

20 Disease, Parkinson's Disease, Down's syndrome, Frontotemporal dementia, Dementia with
   Lewy Bodies, Multiple sclerosis, traumatic brain injury, depression, schizophrenia, bipolar
   disease (and other mental illness), diabetes, hypertension, stroke, heart attack, dyslipidemia,
   other conditions/diseases or aging. In another aspect, cognition is "normal" but patients are
   deemed "at risk" based on their pro-inflammatory endophenotype. In another aspect, the level
25 of expression of the various proteins is measured by at least one of fluorescence detection,
   chemiluminescence detection, electrochemiluminescence detection and patterned arrays, reverse
   transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, antibody binding, fluorescence activated sorting,
   detectable bead sorting, antibody arrays, microarrays, enzymatic arrays, receptor binding arrays,

30 liquid phase binding arrays, fluorescent resonance transfer, or radioactive labeling. In another
   aspect, the high and low end of the proinflammatory group is determined by specifically
   determining the level of expression of C-reactive protein (CRP) and tumor necrosis factor alpha
   (TNFa). In another aspect, the high and low end of the proinflammatory group is determined
   from 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, or 25

                                                     4
   biomarkers. In another aspect, the proinflammatory endophenotypes may be treated with one of
   more of the following non-limiting examples of therapeutic agents: NSAIDs, non-selective
   NSAIDs, selective NSAIDs, steroids, glucocorticoids, Immune Selective Anti-Inflammatory
   Derivatives (ImSAIDs), anti-TNF medications, anti-IL5 drugs, or CRP-lowering agents.            In

   Derivatives (ImSAIDs), anti-TNF medications, anti-IL5 drugs or CRP-lowering agents; are
   contraindicated if the subject does not have a proinflammatory endophenotype.           In another
   aspect, the method further comprises the step of generating a dataset that comprises the level of
10 the one or more biomarkers prior to the step of comparing the level of the one or more
   biomarkers within a sample of patients suffering from cognitive loss.
   In another embodiment, the present invention includes a method for selecting patient therapy for
   improved cognition comprising: obtaining a sample from a subject; measuring the level of
   expression of TNFa and CRP in the sample; determining the tertile of the level of expression of
15 the these two biomarkers; and depending on the level of expression dividing the level of
   expression of the two or more markers as being either high proinflammatory or low
   proinflammatory; and selecting a course of treatment for the subject based on whether the
   subject is selected as being high proinflammatory or low proinflammatory, wherein the tertile is
   determined by: scoring the tertile scores for both markers to generate a score with a range from
20 two to six, assigning a lower score (i.e., 2) to the low end of a proinflammatory, assigning a
   highest score (i.e., 6) score was assigned to a high end of the proinflammatory, with all other
   scores falling in a middle score. In another aspect, the method further comprises the step of
   generating a dataset that comprises the level of expression of TNFa and CRP in the sample prior

25 Detailed Description of the Invention
   While the making and using of various embodiments of the present invention are discussed in
   detail below, it should be appreciated that the present invention provides many applicable
   inventive concepts that can be embodied in a wide variety of specific contexts. The specific
   embodiments discussed herein are merely illustrative of specific ways to make and use the
30 invention and do not delimit the scope of the invention.

                                                    22
   To facilitate the understanding of this invention, a number of terms are defined below. Terms
   defined herein have meanings as commonly understood by a person of ordinary skill in the areas
   relevant to the present invention. Terms such as "a", "an" and "the" are not intended to refer to
   only a singular entity, but include the general class of which a specific example may be used for
 5 illustration. The terminology herein is used to describe specific embodiments of the invention,
   but their usage does not delimit the invention, except as outlined in the claims.
   As used herein, the phrase "neurological disease" refers to a disease or disorder of the central
   nervous system and many include, e.g., neurodegencrative disorders such as AD, Parkinson's
   disease, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia and neurological diseases include
10 multiple sclerosis, neuropathies.     The present invention will find particular use in treating
   cognitive dysfunction associated with AD and other neurodegenerative disorders such as
   Parkinson's Disease, Frontotemporal dementia, Dementia with Lewy Bodies, and Down's
   syndrome.
   As used herein, the terms "Alzheimer's patient", "AD patient", and "individual diagnosed with
15 AD" all refer to an individual who has been diagnosed with AD or has been given a probable
   diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD).
   As used herein, the terms "Parkinson's disease patient", and "individual diagnosed with
   Parkinson's disease" all refer to an individual who has been diagnosed with PD or has been
   given a diagnosis of Parkinson's disease.
20 As used herein, the terms "Frontotemporal dementia", and "individual diagnosed with
   frontotemporal dementia" all refer to an individual who has been diagnosed with FTD or has
   been given a diagnosis of FTD.
   As used herein, the term "Dementia with Lewy bodies" (DLB), and "individual diagnosed with
   DLB" all refer to an individual who has been diagnosed with DLB or has been given a diagnosis
25 of DLB.
   As used herein, the term "Down's syndrome" (DS), and "individual diagnosed with Down's
   syndrome" all refer to an individual who has been diagnosed with DS or has been given a
   diagnosis of DS.
   As used herein, the phrase "neurological disease biomarker" refers to a biomarker that is a
30 neurological disease diagnosis biomarker.
   As used herein, the term "neurological disease biomarker protein", refers to any of: a protein
   biomarkers or substances that are functionally at the level of a protein biomarker.

                                                     23
   As used herein, the terms "cognition", "cognitive ability", "memory", "language" and the like
   are used interchangeably to refer to an individual's ability to perform cognitive abilities and the
   dysfunction of those abilities that may be as a result of a diagnosis of MCI, AD, DLB, FTD,
   DLB, Multiple Sclerosis (MS), PD, or other neurological disease as well as other medical and
 5 psychiatric conditions including, but not limited to, diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia,
   metabolic syndrome, depression, traumatic brain injury, schizophrenia, bipolar disease, as well
   as the cognitive slowing/decline associated with the aging process itself.
   As used herein, methods for "aiding treatment" refer to methods that assist in making a clinical
   determination regarding the course of treatment of cognitive dysfunction associated with the
10 neurological disease (e.g., AD, PD, DLB, FTD, DS or MCI), and may or may not be conclusive
   with respect to the definitive diagnosis.
   As used herein, the term "stratifying" refers to sorting individuals into different classes or strata
   based on the features of a neurological disease.          For example, stratifying a population of
   individuals with Alzheimer's disease involves assigning the individuals on the basis of the
15 severity of the disease (e.g., mild, moderate, advanced, etc.).
   As used herein, the term "predicting" refers to making a finding that an individual has a
   significantly enhanced probability of developing a certain neurological disease.
   As used herein, "biological fluid sample" refers to a wide variety of fluid sample types obtained
   from an individual and can be used in a diagnostic or monitoring assay. Biological fluid sample
20 include, e.g., blood, cerebral spinal fluid (CSF), urine and other liquid samples of biological
   origin.   Commonly, the samples are treatment with stabilizing reagents, solubilization, or
   enrichment for certain components, such as proteins or polynucleotides, so long as they do not
   interfere with the analysis of the markers in the sample.
   As used herein, a "blood sample" refers to a biological sample derived from blood, preferably
25 peripheral (or circulating) blood. A blood sample may be, e.g., whole blood, serum or plasma.
   In certain embodiments, serum is preferred as the source for the biomarkers as the samples are
   readily available and often obtained for other sampling, is stable, and requires less processing,
   thus making it ideal for locations with little to refrigeration or electricity, is easily transportable,
   and is commonly handled by medical support staff.
30 As used herein, a "normal" individual or a sample from a "normal" individual refers to
   quantitative data, qualitative data, or both from an individual who has or would be assessed by a
   physician as not having a disease, e.g., a neurological disease. Often, a "normal" individual is

                                                    24
   also age-matched within a range of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10 years with the sample of the
   individual to be assessed.
   As used herein, the term "treatment" refers to the alleviation, amelioration, and/or stabilization
   of symptoms, as well as delay in progression of symptoms of a particular disorder. For example,
 5 "treatment" of AD includes any one or more of: (1) elimination of one or more symptoms of
   AD, (2) reduction of one or more symptoms of AD, (4) stabilization of the symptoms of AD
   (e.g., failure to progress to more advanced stages of AD), and (5) delay in onset of one or more
   symptoms of AD delay in progression (i.e., worsening) of one or more symptoms of AD; and (6)
   delay in progression (i.e., worsening) of one or more symptoms of AD.
10 As used herein, the term "endophenotype" refers to a subgroup of patients within a broader
   category, which can be defined by biological, cognitive, or psychological/questionnaire data.
   Figure I shows four endophenotypes for cognitive loss. For example, within patients diagnosed
   with traumatic brain injury (TBI) who are suffering from cognitive loss, those TBI patients may
   be subdivided into groups based on a pro-inflammatory endophenotype, neurotrophic factor
15 endophenotype, metabolic endophenotype and even a depressive endophenotype.
   As used herein, the term "fold difference" refers to a numerical representation of the magnitude
   difference between a measured value and a reference value, e.g., an AD biomarker, a
   Parkinson's biomarker, a dementia biomarker, or values that allow for the differentiation of one
   or more of the neurological diseases. Typically, fold difference is calculated mathematically by
20 division of the numeric measured value with the numeric reference value. For example, if a
   measured value for an AD biomarker is 20 nanograms/milliliter (ng/ml), and the reference value
   is 10 ng/ml, the fold difference is 2 (20/10=2). Alternatively, if a measured value for an AD
   biomarker is 10 nanograms/milliliter (ng/ml), and the reference value is 20 ng/ml, the fold
   difference is 10/20 or -0.50 or -50%).
25 As used herein, a "reference value" can be an absolute value, a relative value, a value that has an
   upper and/or lower limit, a range of values; an average value, a median value, a mean value, or a
   value as compared to a particular control or baseline value. Generally, a reference value is based
   on an individual sample value, such as for example, a value obtained from a sample from the
   individual with e.g., a neurological disease such as AD, Parkinson's Disease, or dementia,
30 preferably at an earlier point in time, or a value obtained from a sample from an neurological
   disease patient other than the individual being tested, or a "normal" individual, that is an
   individual not diagnosed with AD, Parkinson's Disease, or dementia. The reference value can
   be based on a large number of samples, such as from AD patients, Parkinson's Disease patients,

                                                        25
   dementia patients, or normal individuals or based on a pool of samples including or excluding
   the sample to be tested.
   As used herein, the phrase "a predetermined amount of time" is used to describe the length of
   time between measurements that would yield a statistically significant result, which in the case
 5 of disease progression for cognitive loss can be 7 days, 2 weeks, one month, 3 months, 6
   months, 9 months, 1 year, 1 year 3 months, 1 year 6 months, 1 year 9 months, 2 years, 2 years 3
   months, 2 years 6 months, 2 years 9 months, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or even 10 years and combinations
   thereof
   As used herein, the phrases "neurocognitive screening tests", or "cognitive test" are used to
10 describe one or more tests known to the skilled artisan for measuring cognitive status or
   impairment and can include but is not limited to: a 4-point clock drawing test, an verbal fluency
   test, trail making test, list learning test, and the like. The skilled artisan will recognize and know
   how these tests can be modified, how new tests that measure similar cognitive function can be
   developed and implemented for use with the present invention.
15 Cognitive loss is common among the aging/elderly population. Approximately 10-12% of all
   individuals age 65 and above suffer from Alzheimer's disease with another approximately 20%
   suffering from mild cognitive impairment (MCI), which is a prodromal phase to Alzheimer's
   disease. Additionally, cognitive loss is commonly associated with other neurodegenerative (e.g.
   Parkinson's disease, frontotemporal dementia), neurological (e.g. traumatic brain injury,
20 multiple sclerosis), psychiatric (e.g. depression, bipolar, schizophrenia) and other medical
   conditions (e.g. diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia). On the other hand, the "one-size-fits-all"
   approach to treating cognitive loss among adults and elders has largely been a failure. For
   example, all clinical trials focusing on beta amyloid protein within Alzheimer's disease have
   failed in Phase III testing with no new medications approved for this disease in decades.
25 Additionally, while there are well-established depression - cognition and diabetes - cognition
   links, trials focusing on disease specific interventions have been of limited benefit.           These
   failures led to the present discovery, namely, that there are many underlying biological reasons
   for cognitive loss and that these systems may be largely "disease" irrelevant. For example,
   inflammation is related to many diseases (e.g. Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, cancer,
30 multiple sclerosis, diabetes, TBI), which the present inventors have recognized are linked to
   poorer cognition across diseases. Therefore, the present inventors have subgrouped patients who
   am at increased risk for cognitive loss related to underlying dysfunction of the inflammatory,
   and other systems, and to treatment regimens that improve or prevent such cognitive loss across

                                                    26
   disease conditions. To date, there have been no strategies for prevention of cognitive loss that
   have been proven effective.
   The present inventors have developed an endophenotype approach to treating and preventing
   cognitive loss among aging population. The term endophenotype' has been discussed frequently
 5 in psychiatry and they provide a way for identifying subgroups of clinical phenotypes 2. The
   present invention demonstrates four distinct endophenotypes that can be used to guide cognitive
   impairment therapy:       inflammatory3 4, , neurotrophic   factor,   depressive   and metabolic7
   endophenotypes of cognitive loss. Endophenotypes of cognitive loss have also been identified
   based on neuropathology, neuroimaging",         genetics", and cerebrospinal fluid markers' 2 . The
10 inventors provide herein four endophenotypes specifically designed to guide therapy and
   exemplary therapies for use with the invention.
   Pro-inflammatory endophenotype. When providing treatment for those subjects identified with
   the pro-inflammatory endophenotypes, the treatment can include the following. Nonsteroidal
   anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs): Non-selective NSAIDs - non-selective NSAIDs would be
15 selected for those patients falling into the high end of the proinflammatory endophenotype. As
   shown herein, non-selective NSAIDs (naproxen) were the superior treatment to selective
   NSAIDs (celecoxib). Non-selective NSAIDs can be tested with anyone falling within the high
   end of the proinflammatory endophenotype.
   Selective NSAIDs: selective NSAIDs (e.g. celecoxib) can be tested with those falling within the
20 high end of the proinflammatory endophenotype.
   Steroids: Many steroids, glucocorticoids, have anti-inflammatory properties and can be
   considered for those patients falling within the high end of the pro-inflammatory endophenotype.
   Immune Selective Anti-Inflammatory Derivatives (ImSAIDs): ImSAIDs can be considered for
   patients falling within the high end of the proinflammatory endophenotype.
25 Anti-TNF medications can be specifically utilized for those within the high end of the
   proinflammatory endophenotype where TNFa weighs most heavily.
   Anti-IL5 drugs can be utilized for those within the high end of the proinflammatory
   endophenotype where IL-5 weighs most heavily.
   CRP-lowering agents can be selectively utilized for those in the high end of the proinflammatory
30 endophenotype where CRP weighs most heavily.
   Metabolic Endophenotype.

                                                   27
   When providing treatment for those subjects identified with the metabolic endophenotypes anti
   diabetic medications can be utilized for those falling within the low or high end of the metabolic
   endophenotype, depending on the mechanism of action of the drug.
   Insulin would be utilized for those whose metabolic endophenotype weighs insulin heavily.
 5 Insulin may be utilized also for those whose metabolic endophenotype weighs glucose levels
   most heavily.
   GLP-I medications would be utilized for those whose metabolic endophenotype weighs GLP-l
   most heavily. In the inventors' prior work, GLP-1 was higher among those with cognitive
   dysfunction; however, higher levels of GLP-l was associated with better memory and therefore
10 would be administered for treatment of cognitive problems among those with cognitive loss and
   prevention of cognitive loss among cognitively normal elders.
   Amylin-related medications can be utilized for those whose metabolic endophenotype weighs
   amylin most heavily.
   Oral hypoglycemics can be tested among any patients who are in the high end of the metabolic
15 endophenotype.
   Neurotrophic Endophenotype.
   When providing treatment for those subjects identified with the neurotrophic endophenotypes
   neurotrophic factor agonists can be examined for improved cognitive function and prevention of
   cognitive loss among those in the low end of the neurotrophic endophenotype. Neurotrophic
20 factor agonists can be examined for cognitive improvement among those in the high end of the
   neurotrophic endophenotype. It is unlikely that those in the middle group of the neurotrophic
   endophenotype will experience cognitive benefit or decline from such treatments.
   Exercise therapy can be prescribed to any patients who fall into the low end of the neurotrophic
   endophenotype for prevention or treatment of cognitive loss as well as for improvement of
25 cognitive loss among those in the high end of the neurotrophic endophenotype.
   BDNF and BDNF agonists would be utilized for those patients in the low end of the
   neurotrophic endophenotype for improved cognition as well as prevention of cognitive loss.
   Such medications would be utilized for treating cognitive loss among the high end of the
   endophenotype. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, selective serotonin 2C (5-HT2C)
30 antagonists, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, and tricyclic antidepressants have
   been found to increase BDNF levels and may be particularly useful in treating and/or preventing
   cognitive loss for those whose neurotrophic endophenotype weighs BDNF most heavily.

                                                    28
   Combined exercise and medications such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, selective
   serotonin 2C (5-HT2C) antagonists, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, and tricyclic
   antidepressants have been found to increase BDNF levels and may be particularly useful in
   treating and/or preventing cognitive loss for those whose neurotrophic endophenotype weighs
 5 BDNF most heavily.
   GDNF and GDNF agonists would be utilized for those patients in the low end of the
   neurotrophic endophenotype for improved cognition as well as prevention of cognitive loss.
   Such medications would be utilized for treating cognitive loss among the high end of the
   endophenotype.
10 Depressive Endophenotype.
   When providing treatment for those subjects identified with the depressive endophenotypes
   antidepressant medications and/or therapy can be utilized for those who score elevated on the
   depressive endophenotype of cognitive loss (DepE) for treatment and/or prevention of cognitive
   dysfunction.
15 Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, selective serotonin 2C (5-HT2C) antagonists, serotonin
   norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, and tricyclic antidepressants have been found related to
   cognitive functioning may be useful in treating and/or preventing cognitive loss for those whose
   score elevated on DepE scores.
   Combined exercise and medications such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, selective
20 serotonin 2C (5-HT2C) antagonists, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, and tricyclic
   antidepressants may be particularly useful in treating and/or preventing cognitive loss for those
   who score elevated on the DepE.
   For those subjects with a proinflammatory endophenotype that weighs IL-6 most heavily,
   selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, selective serotonin 2C (5-HT2C) antagonists, serotonin
25 norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, and tricyclic antidepressants may be particularly useful in
   treating and/or preventing cognitive loss for those who score elevated on the DepE.
   For those subjects with an proinflammatory endophenotype that weights IL-6 and/or TNFa most
   heavily, combined exercise and antidepressant therapy (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors,
   selective serotonin 2C (5-HT2C) antagonists, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, and
30 tricyclic antidepressants) may be particularly useful in treating and/or preventing cognitive loss
   for those who score elevated on the DepE.

                                                   29
   Proinflammatory Endophenotype.
   Cognitive dysfunction and decline is a major source of morbidity and mortality in the U.S. and is
   associated with greater health care cost, decreased treatment compliance, lost wages (patient and
   family), decreased productivity, poorer quality of life and gradual loss of independence. The
 5 most prominent form of cognitive loss is dementia of the Alzheimer's type; however, cognitive
   loss is also associated with traumatic brain injury (TBI), multiple sclerosis (MS), Parkinson's
   disease (PD), depression, schizophrenia, as well as many other disorders/diseases. Interestingly,
   inflammation is a common biological pathway that has been linked with each of these conditions
   as well as cognitive loss. Additionally, epidemiological studies suggest that use of anti
10 inflammatory medications is associated with decreased risk for cognitive loss/dementia as well
   as increased cognitive functioning among various disease states (e.g. TBI) though these results
   have been inconsistent and with many clinical trials ending in failure. To date, no prior work has
   been undertaken to develop a personalized medicine approach to identification of which specific
   patients should or should not be placed on anti-inflammatory medications in order to improve
15 cognition. The novel method of the present invention was explicitly developed as a personalized
   medicine approach that identifies not only the sub-population of individuals who should be
   placed on anti-inflammatory medications for cognitive enhancing benefits, but equally
   important, which sub-population should not be placed on these medications as it is associated
   with greater cognitive loss. This new method can be implemented in clinical trials and practice
20 to improve/stabilize cognition among a select sub-population of patients as well as screen out
   patients that should not be placed on anti-inflammatory medications due to risk of increased
   cognitive decline. The present inventors, have discussed the existence of a proinflammatory
   endophenotypes, however, this work for the first time provides a distinct endophenotypes, a
   combination of endophenotypes, and/or a critical therapeutic regimen as a result of the
25 endophenotype   34,I5,16
   In order to determine if the proinflammatory endophenotype predicted treatment response,
   baseline plasma samples were analyses from a previously conducted trial of the Alzheimer's
   Disease Cooperative Study (ADCS, Aisen et al 2003, JAMA).
   Baseline plasma samples were assayed using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) for a range of
30 inflammatory markers. The pro-inflammatory profile was generated using CRP and TNFa.
   Additional markers can be used to improve the already robust results shown herein.             The
   frequency of the low, middle (referent group) and high ends of the pro-inflammatory profile are
   presented below.

   When looking at change in MMSE scores over the 12 month period of the trial, the findings
   were as follows: Placebo group - (a) those in the low end of the pro-inflammatory profile were
   stable over 12 months (stable in disease severity and cognitive functioning) when compared to
 5 the high end and the referent group (i.e. middle group), (b) those in the high end declined
   significantly over 12 months when compared to the referent group and the low end of the pro
   inflammatory profile. Treatment group - (a) those in the low end of the pro-inflammatory profile
   (group 1 in Figure 2) who were treated with an anti-inflammatory drug declined significantly
   faster (i.e. disease severity and cognition) when compared to the referent group (i.e. middle
10 group; group 2 in Figure 2)), (b) those in the high end (group 3 in Figure 2) were stable over 12
   months when treated with an anti-inflammatory drug when compared to the low end of the pro
   inflammatory profile and the referent group. Therefore, treatment is indicated among those in the
   high end of the proinflamnatory endophenotypes, but contraindicated among those in the low
   end of the proinflammatory endophenotype.
15 When considering disease severity (i.e., clinical dementia rating (CDR) Sum of Boxes
   [CDRSum]), the same was found. See Figure 3. Specifically, those in the low end of the pro
   inflammatory profile who were treated with an anti-inflammatory drug progressed in disease
   severity more rapidly over 12 months than any other group whereas those who were in that same
   biomarker-defined group declined minimally over 12 months if left untreated. On the other

                                                     31
   hand, those in the high end who were treated declined less than those who were untreated though
   the magnitude of difference is less than that observed from the objective cognitive measure
   above (i.e., mini-mental state examination (MMSE) scores).
   When examining baseline cognitive and disease severity markers from an independent cohort of
 5 AD cases and normal controls, the pro-inflammatory endophenotypes profile of the present
   invention clearly discriminated between patients' baseline characteristics. Figure 4 shows a
   linear decrease in cognitive functioning (MMSE scores). Figure 5 clearly demonstrates a linear
   increase in disease severity based on the pro-inflammatory profile among AD patients. Figure 6
   demonstrates the same linear decline in baseline cognitive ability (MMSE scores) among non
10 demented normal controls as a function of the pro-inflammatory profile.
   Metabolic Endophenotype.
   As discussed herein above, cognitive dysfunction and decline is a major source of morbidity and
   mortality in the U.S. Interestingly, metabolic dysfunction and diabetes is a common biological
   pathway that has been linked with each of these conditions as well as cognitive loss.
15 Additionally, epidemiological studies suggest that midlife diabetes is a powerful risk factor for
   late-life cognitive loss and that diabetes is associated with increased neuropathological burden at
   autopsy. As a result of this literature, several clinical trials have been conducted using diabetes
   and metabolic medications to treat Alzheimer's disease, Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI)
   (MCI; pre-AD) with some success and several ongoing studies. In fact, one group has begun a
20 phase 3 trial of intranasal insulin as a therapy for MCI and early AD. While there has been some
   success, the therapeutic benefits have been modest and no prior work has been conducted to
   identify the specific patients with diabetes at greatest risk for cognitive loss. The novel method
   of the present invention was expressly developed as a companion diagnostic method (and
   personalized medicine approach) that identifies the sub-population of individuals who should be
25 placed on diabetes/metabolic medications for cognitive enhancing benefits. The present
   invention can be implemented in clinical trials to best select patients most likely to benefit from
   the treatment thereby substantially reducing the sample sizes required.
   The present inventors proposed a metabolic endophenotype among MCI and AD based on (1)
   prior work linking diabetes and metabolic disturbance to MCI and AD and (2) and the inventors'
30 prior biomarker and clinical work among Mexican Americans 't The inventors also sought to
   characterize the metabolic endophenotype (MetEndo) among those diagnosed with MCI, AD
   and cognitively normal elders. Utilizing a multi-marker approach the present inventors have
   generated a metabolic endophenotypes (MetEndo). Those in the low end of the MetEndo (group

                                                    32
    1) have minimal metabolic disturbance from a profile approach whereas those in the high end
   (group 3) have high levels of metabolic disturbance with all others remaining within the middle
   range (group 2). The inventors have found that the MetEndo predicts cognitive function and
   decline as well as risk for progression among those with metabolic dysfunction. The MetEndo
 5 should only be relevant for a subset of patients diagnosed with MCI and AD as the underlying
   neuropathology for AD is quite complex and there likely exists numerous endophenotypes. As
   disclosed herein the present inventors further demonstrated the existence and use of several
   endophenotypes      including   an     inflammatory     endophenotype' 6 ,  neurotrophic  factor
   endophenotype      as well as a depressive endophenotype       and direct methods of treatment
10 accordingly. In fact, the present invention can even be used to retrospectively analyze blood
   samples from previously conducted clinical trials to demonstrate that this approach (i.e.,
   proinflammatory endophenotype)        identifies a subgroup of AD patients that benefited
   significantly from a previously "failed" clinical trial. Therefore, the metabolic endophenotype
   can be utilized to treat specific subpopulations of AD patients to slow disease progression,
15 reduce progression from MCI to AD in select subpopulations and even prevent cognitive loss
   among specific subpopulations of cognitive normal elders suffering from diabetes.
   When examining prevalence of the MetEndo, the inventors found that 20% of MCI patients fit
   into the high end of the MetEndo as compared to 5% in the low end of the MetEndo. The rate
   increased to 25% in the high end when restricted to MCI cases diagnosed with diabetes. Those in
20 the low end experienced greater cognitive dysfunction and increased disease severity at baseline
   (Table 2) and their pathology is likely driven largely by non-metabolic factors, namely AP (see
   table above; number 1= low MetEndo, 2=middle group; 3= high MetEndo). Of note, the
   MetEndo grouping is entirely independent of clinical characterization, but all patients were
   diagnosed with MCI. Interestingly, when examining cognitively normal elders (NC), there was
25 also a significant difference in cognitive outcomes by the MetEndo groupings (see Table 3).
   Within the NC group, the high end of the MetEndo performed most poorly with regards to
   cognitive outcome variables. Therefore, there is a shift in cognitive ability from NC to MCI to
   AD (looked the same as MCI) as a function of MetEndo.

   Based on this change, the high end of the MetEndo was used to show a significant association
   with the progression from NC to MCI and to AD.              Over a 24 month follow-up period, the
 5 highest overall rate of overall progression was found among the high end of the MetEndo group
   (25%) as compared to 10% among the low MetEndo group and 200% in the middle group
   (progression in low and middle group likely due to non-metabolic factors). Additionally, 18% of
   NCs in the high end of the MetEndo converted to MCI as compared to 7% of those in the low
   MetEndo group. A total of 34% of the MCI cases in the high MetEndo group progressed to AD
10 within 24 months. The MetEndo was a significant predictor of progression from NC to MCI
   (AUC   =  0.63) and MCI to AD (AUC       = 0.60). Interestingly, 42% of the low end of the MetEndo
   progressed to AD over 24 months. This is likely due to the fact that (1) baseline cognition was
   lower in this group, and (2) the underlying pathology is loaded heavily to As and these patients
   would benefit best from therapeutic agents targeting that mechanism specifically. Therefore, this
15 method can be used for screening into the large-scale APi prevention trials (e.g. an A4 trial).

    Neurotrophic Endophenotype.
   A neurotrophic endophenotype was used to evaluate and treat cognitive loss/Alzheimer's disease
 5 (AD). The inventors have shown that neurotrophic factors, such as brain derived neurotrophic
   factor (BDNF) could potentially be a biomarker of Alzheimer's disease presence. However, it
   was found that BDNF levels were not significant predictors of disease status. On the other hand,
   BDNF levels were significantly related to memory performance among those diagnosed with
   AD. It is shown herein that neurotrophic factors (i.e., BDNF, NGF, TN-3, CNTF, GDNF, LIF,
10 and GGF) can be used to identify a subset of individuals at risk for cognitive loss specifically
   related to this biological system. As such, knowledge of where someone falls within this specific
   endophenotype will guide a specific therapy for preventing and/or treating cognitive loss. It is
   shown herein that by simply using BDNF levels, one can clearly demonstrate different cognitive
   abilities among those with and without cognitive dysfunction. In Figure 7, it is evident that
15 global cognitive ability (MMSE scores) varies as a function of BDNF levels by patient type
   (l=Alzheimer's disease, 2=normal control, 3=mild cognitive impairment).
   Additionally, when examined across cognitive test scores, a clear pattern emerged. Table 4
   shows that, specifically, among those with cognitive loss (AD or MCI) higher score on the

                                                    35
   neurotrophic endophenotype (range 1-4 with 4 being high levels) are associated with poorer
   cognitive scores and more advanced disease severity among those with cognitive loss (MCI and
   AD). On the other hand, higher neurotrophic endophenotype score (i.e. 4) is associated with
   better cognitive functioning among those who are cognitively normal. This shows that there is a
 5 shift in the importance of neurotrophic factors as an elder transitions from normal elder to
   cognitively impaired.     By way of explanation, but in no way a limitation of the present
   invention, this paradoxical finding of higher BDNF levels being associated with poorer memory
   abilities may be due to a compensatory effect.     That is, the brain is producing higher levels of
   neurotrophic factors in an effort to compensate for accumulating neuropathology. In fact, this is
10 similar to the findings and hypothesis that led to the eventual FDA approval of several
   cholinesterase inhibitors for the treatment of AD.

Depressive Endophenotype
There is long-standing literature demonstrating the negative impact of depression on cognitive
health among elders23 with comorbid depression and cognitive dysfunction leading to greater
impairment in activities of daily living as well as decreased quality of life24-2 6. However,

                                                  39
   identification of the specific patients suffering from depression most likely to experience
   cognitive dysfunction has remained elusive.     The present inventors analyzed data from two
   independent cohorts, Project FRONTIER and the Texas Alzheimer's Research & Care
   Consortium (TARCC), to generate and cross-validate the depressive endophenotype of
 5 MCI/AD".
   Depressive Endophenotype Identification. Development. First, the inventors randomly divided
   the Project FRONTIER cohort into two samples, the training (n=255, 52 MCI and 203 normal
   controls) and test sample (n=263, MCI n=60, control n=203). In the training sample, a series of
   J analyses were conducted to identify which of the 30 items from the Geriatric Depression
10 Scale were significantly endorsed more among the MCI cases.          In the training sample, the
   following items were significantly endorsed more often among the MCI group than the normal
   cognition group: feeling of worse memory problems      (f=12.39,  p<0.001), feeling downhearted
   and blue (x=6.97, p=0.008), feeling worthless (X=5.58, p=0.0 2 ), frequently feel like crying
   (X2=6.50, p=0.01), and trouble concentrating (X=7.82, p=0.005).             Of note, a positive
15 endorsement on each of these items is in the direction of presence of depression, therefore
   reverse scoring was not needed. The depressive endophenotype (DepE) was generated by
   summing the responses of each person on these 5 items.
   Validation. Next, logistic regression was used to determine the risk of being diagnosed with
   MCI as a function of DepE scores within the test sample. DepE scores significantly increased
20 risk for MCI diagnosis (odds ratio [OR]     =  2.04; 95% C=1.54-2.69), which was the only
   significant predictor aside from age (OR=l.09; 95% CI=1.05-1.13) and education (OR=0.82;
   95% CI=0.71-0.95). In a conditional stepwise forward logistic regression, age entered into the
   model first, followed by DepE scores; no other variables entered into the model. Of note, GDS
   total scores (minus DepE items) were not significantly related to MCI status with DepE scores
25 entered into the model. Therefore, DepE scores and not global depression scores are specifically
   related to MCI risk. ApoEE4 genotype (the single strongest genetic risk for MCI and AD) did not
   enter the model.
   Depressive Endophenotype Cross-Validation. Cross-Sectional Analyses. Next, the DepE was
   applied to the TARCC cohort. A logistic regression model was created with AD versus normal
30 control as the outcome variable; age, gender, education, ApoEc4 presence (yes/no), GDS total
   score and DepE scores entered as the predictor variables. Age (OR=1.18, 95% CI= 1.12-1.24,
   p<0.001), ApoEa4 status (OR=2.42, 95% CI=l.13-5.19, p=0.02) and the DepE scores (OR=2.49,
   95% CI=1.40-4.43, p=0. 0 0 2 ) were the only significant predictors of AD status. In the forward

                                                    40
   conditional stepwise logistic regression, the order of entry into the model was age, DepE scores
   (before ApoEs4 genotype), and ApoEs4 status. DepE score alone was a significant predictor of
   AD status using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis (Area Under the Curve
   [AUC] = 0.74 (95% CI=0.68-0.81), p<0.001). Longitudinal Analyses. Baseline DepE scores
 5 were also significantly related to global cognitive decline (MMSE scores) and increased disease
   progression (Clinical Dementia Rating scores) longitudinally". The inventors also analyzed data
   from the Western Australia Memory Study cohort. This cohort included cognitively normal
   adults and elders being followed longitudinally to identify factors associated with cognitive loss.
   Among those ages 65 and above, elevations in DepE scores were significantly related to poorer
10 cognitive functioning (i.e. below the mean of the cohort)(OR       = 1.53; 95% CI  =  1.01 - 2.32,
   p=0.0 4 ). Among those 70 and above, elevations in DepE scores were the single strongest risk for
   poorer cognitive functioning (OR=2.23, 95% Cl 1.12 - 4.40, p=0.02) with age nor education
   being significant.
   More recent analyses were conducted to determine (1) the impact of improvement in DepE
15 scores on cognition over time and (2) further cross-validation of DepE among non-demented
   older adults in another independent study. Preliminary analyses were also conducted to
   determine the impact of change in DepE scores over time specifically on memory scores using
   WMS Logical Memory I and Il. Normal was considered to be a DepE score =0-1 with any score
   >=2 being considered high. The groups were as follows. Figure 8 is a graph that depicts change
20 in immediate (LMI) and delayed (LMII) verbal memory among normal controls (NC) and AD
   cases over a 12-month period. While improvement in DepE scores did not result in a change in
   memory abilities among AD cases, there was a tremendous improvement in memory scores
   (immediate and delayed) among normal controls who experienced an improvement in DepE
   scores. In fact, non-demented elders who were elevated on DepE scores obtained baseline
25 memory scale scores a full standard deviation (i.e. 3 scale score points) below those without an
   elevation in DepE scores. However, improvement in DepE scores over 12-months resulted in an
   improvement in immediate and delayed memory scores of I full standard deviation (3 scale
   score points) equivalent to the level of cognitively normal elders that did not show baseline
   DepE elevations. Importantly, these findings show that intervening before the diagnosis of AD is
30 warranted and the DepE offers a way of identifying those cognitively normal or mild cognitive
   impairment (MCI) patients that will experience cognitive improvement from antidepressant
   treatment. This cognitive improvement would be due to depression associated with TBI,
   Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, diabetes and many other medical conditions as well as
   depression independent of or in absence of other medical conditions.

   Method for identifying patients for a personalized medicine approach to treating and preventing
   cognitive loss.
   Cognitive dysfunction and decline is a major source of morbidity and mortality in the U.S.
   Cognitive dysfunction is associated with greater health care cost, decreased treatment
 5 compliance, lost wages (patient and family), decreased productivity, poorer quality of life and
   gradual loss of independence. The most prominent form of cognitive loss is dementia of the
   Alzheimer's type; however, cognitive loss is also associated with traumatic brain injury (TBI),
   multiple sclerosis (MS), Parkinson's disease (PD), depression, schizophrenia, as well as many
   other disorders/diseases. Interestingly, inflammation is a common biological pathway that has
10 been linked with each of these conditions as well as cognitive loss. The inventors have
   previously generated a blood-based method for (1) identification of Alzheimer's Disease and (2)
   detecting and discriminating between neurodegenerative diseases. However, these data also
   suggest that the biological algorithms and endophenotypes generated can also distinguish
   cognitive ability among those within the pre-AD stage of Mild Cognitive Impairment as well as
15 among cognitively normal adults and elders. The methods taught herein can also identify those
   at greatest risk for cognitive decline. A purpose of the current invention is the introduction of a
   method for selecting patients into trials aimed at preventing and/or treating cognitive loss based
   on the disclosed endophenotype methods.
   The primary method for selecting patients into clinical trials is on disease diagnosis. However,
20 most diseases have incredibly complex etiologies (e.g. diabetes, heart disease, Alzheimer's
   disease, depression). The approach begins with the patient presenting with a diagnosis of
   cognitive loss. Therefore, the current methods are directed towards the diagnosis of cognitive
   loss, independent of disease state. The cognitive loss may be due to any number of underlying
   conditions including, but not limited to Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Multiple
25 Sclerosis, stroke, other neurodegenerative or neurological disease, depression or other affective
   disturbance, diabetes and other metabolic disturbance, heart disease, and thyroid disease. Once
   identified as having or at risk for cognitive loss, the personalized medicine approach can also be
   used.
   When examining baseline cognitive and disease severity markers for those diagnosed with
30 Alzheimer's disease and normal controls, the present inventors have shown that inflammatory
   profiles can discriminate between cognitive abilities.
   Figure 9 shows a linear decrease in cognitive functioning (MMSE scores). When examining
   baseline cognitive and disease severity markers for those diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease

                                                   42
   and normal controls, the inventors show herein that inflammatory profiles can discriminate
   between cognitive abilities. Figure 9 shows a linear decrease in cognitive functioning (MMSE
   scores).    Figure 10 demonstrates a linear increase in disease severity based on the pro
   inflammatory profile among AD patients. Figure 11 demonstrates the same linear decline in
 5 baseline cognitive ability (MMSE scores) among non-demented normal controls as a function of
   the pro-inflammatory profile.
   Figure 12 shows the link between the blood-based biomarker system and the presence of beta
   amyloid (AP) in those with and without cognitive impairment (AD n=2, MCI n=2, control
   n=2)(change in management delayed the scans). In this example, 4 of the 6 participants were
10 positive for AP (2 AD, 1 MCI & I control) when the test was conducted. It was found that the
   blood-based biomarker system was 100% accurate in detecting As positivity.
   These results demonstrate that the systematic approach of the present invention accurately
   detects Mild Cognitive Impairment. Next, the inventors assayed 269 samples (normal control
   n=88, MCI n=57, AD n=124) to: (1) detect amnestic versus non-amnestic MCI and (2)
15 discriminate MCI from AD. The biomarker profile accurately detected amnestic MCI
   (AUC=0.94, SN=0.97, SP=0.87). The same methodology was slightly less accurate in detecting
   non-amnestic MCI (AUC=0.70, SN=0.70, SP=0.66) though the incorporation of minimal
   cognitive testing significantly increased the accuracy (see below). Thus, the biomarker profile
   plus Trail Making Test part B improved accuracy in detecting amnestic MCI (AUC=.95) and
20 non-amnestic MCI (AUC=0.85). In one non-limiting example of discriminating MCI from AD,
   it was important to split the process by APOE4 genotype. The present invention was most
   accurate at distinguishing MCI from AD among APOE4 non-carriers (AUC=0.80, SN=0.85,
   SP=0.74) as compared to APOE4 carriers (AUC=0.76, SN=0.44, SP=0.90). However, inclusion
   of animal naming increased overall accuracy to 0.86 among non-APOE4 carriers and to 0.89
25 among APOE4 carriers.
   The present invention can also be used to identify cognitive loss among those without frank
   impairment. In fact, the present invention was 100% accurate in detecting those "cognitively
   normal" elders who had poorer memory abilities (i.e. <1.0 sd on story memory).
   The present invention also allows the prediction of future risk for cognitive dysfunction. First,
30 outlined above is the data where the present invention was used to identify amyloid-beta
   positivity. Having amyloid-beta within the brain is a very strong risk factor for future cognitive
   decline. Next, biomarkers of metabolic dysfunction were used to demonstrate the efficacy of the
   methods taught herein to predict cognitive loss over time. The metabolic risk score predicted

                                                     43
   future cognitive loss among those who were cognitively normal at baseline as well as predicted
   risk for progression from MCI to AD.
   Therefore, these data demonstrate that the present invention can be used to identify individuals
   with or at risk for cognitive loss using an overall profile approach as well as specific
 5 endophenotype approaches (e.g. inflammation, metabolic dysfunction, neurotrophic system,
   depressive endophenotype).
   Method for Producing Prognostic Models of Patient Responses to Therapeutic Molecules.
   Billions of dollars has been spent on "failed" clinical trials. A key flaw to the current design of
   most trials is the selection of patient populations. Specifically, patients are typically screened
10 into trials based on a heterogeneous disease classification rather than the specific biology of the
   drug and the patient's baseline biological profile. As an example, Alzheimer's disease clinical
   trials recruit based on a clinical diagnosis of NINDS-ADRDA            (or newer NIA-AA) criteria
   "Probable Alzheimer's Disease" without regard to any specific underlying biological mechanism
   linked to AD itself Because of the "one-size-fits-all" approach to many clinical trials seeking a
15 single cure/treatment for a complex disease process, there are thousands of previously conducted
   "failed" trials with potentially useful therapeutic molecules that will not make it to patients who
   would benefit most by those particular medications. It is also well-known that all trials have
   responders and non-responders, but the trials are designed to look for group-level effects rather
   than sub-populations.
20 The identification of patients most likely to be responders, non-responders and adverse
   responders to therapeutic agents has tremendous potential for revolutionizing medical practice.
   Currently, the majority of clinical trials enroll patients by heterogeneous disease categorizations
   (e.g. Alzheimer's disease, Multiple Sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, COPD, chronic kidney
   disease) rather than sub-categorizations of patients most likely to respond to a given therapy. A
25 method for the generation of companion diagnostic tools explicitly designed to identify those
   patients most likely to benefit is shown herein. It has the further advantage that the present
   invention has no impact (negative consequences) on previously conducted clinical trials. Thus,
   this method (outlined briefly below) can then be used to: (1) target medications to specific
   patient populations and even (2) generate new clinical trials that enroll specific patients most
30 likely to benefit from the specific drug itself.
   Broadly, the methods generated for use here monitor dysfunction within multiple biological
   systems including inflammation, neurotrophic factors, and metabolic dysfunction. Other systems
   can be also be targeted to the specific therapeutic molecule as deemed appropriate for a

                                                      44
   particular candidate drug. These systems are monitored via proteomic analyses though genomic
   (as well as other) markers can be incorporated as needed for the particular compound. It is
   important to note that this is not a single-marker approach. The superiority of multi-marker
   approaches when considering proteomic analyses as applied to complex diseases has already
 5 been shown hereinabove. Therefore, overall dysfunction of the system is monitored rather than
   the method being skewed by any single marker. With appropriate sample sizes within each
   individual trial analyzed, the systems are monitored via advanced bioinformatics (e.g. structural
   equation modeling, random forest analysis, support vector machines).
   Once the specific systems are selected for monitoring and samples identified, the approach can
10 be applied in a variety of ways. However, the optimal approach is as follows, which requires
   multiple previously-conducted trials (e.g. Phase 2a, Phase 2b, Phase 3).
   Step 1. Generation of the prediction model. This approach will take 2 forms:
   (1) a priori definition of the systems and how they will predict treatment response (positive,
   negative and no response); (2) a theoretical discovery of the optimal prediction algorithm for
15 detection of responders, non-responders and adverse responders. This entire step takes place in
   the initial clinical trial completely independent of all other trials.
   Step 2. Application and refinement of the model. Once the model is generated from Step 1, it is
   applied blindly to the second clinical trial to predict outcomes. Next, the process in Step 1 is
   used again in this second trial to further refine the predictive algorithm.
20 Step 3. Validation of the model. Once the model has been generated and refined, it is then
   applied to the first Phase 3 clinical trial to determine the efficacy of the model in predicting
   treatment responders, non-responders and adverse responders. If a second Phase 3 trial is
   available, the model is applied again with further refinement if necessary.
    1. The outcome variables of treatment response are open. For example, for MS the outcome can
25 be relapse rates, but also quality of life, daily living ability, depression rates (depressive
   endophenotypes), cognitive ability (again the depressive endophenotype is useful here), or
   whatever outcome of interest to the user.
   2. The product at the end of the project is designed to be a companion diagnostic that can be
   used to (a) select patients for targeted therapy and/or (b) design a new clinical trial that
30 specifically targets only those patients most likely to respond.
   The current methodology provides a method for refining target populations to therapeutic
   molecules. Despite the fact that most therapeutic molecules do not make it through Phase 3

                                                      45
   trials, many of these molecules have considerable impact for sub-populations of patients.
   However, a company cannot post hoc analyze a clinical trial and present that information to the
   FDA. On the other hand, the method taught herein provides a novel way for the identification of
   treatment responders, non-responders and adverse responders which can then be used to: (1)
 5 target specific patient populations with FDA approved drugs, as well as (2) design additional
   Phase 3 trials that will selectively enroll (and rule out) target populations to demonstrate efficacy
   of these therapeutic molecules.
   Blood samples from a previously conducted clinical trial among AD patients was used. This trial
   was conducted by the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study (ADCS, Aisen et al 2003,
10 JAMA).
   Baseline plasma samples were assayed using ECL for a range of inflammatory markers. The
   pro-inflammatory profile was generated using CRP and TNFa. The frequency of the low,
   middle (referent group) and high ends of the pro- inflammatory profile are presented in Table 5.
   Table 5 is a summary of the changes in MMSE scores over the 12 month period of the trial.

   Table 5 is a summary of the changes in MMSE scores over the 12 month period of the trial. The
   findings were as follows: Placebo group - (a) those in the low end of the pro-inflammatory
   profile were stable over 12 months (stable in disease severity and cognitive functioning) when
   compared to the high end and the referent group (i.e. middle group), (b) those in the high end
 5 declined significantly over 12 months when compared to the referent group and the low end of
   the pro-inflamnnatory profile.
   Figure 13 shows the results for the treatment group - (a) those in the low end of the pro
   inflammatory profile (group I in Figure 13) who were treated with an anti-inflammatory drug
   declined significantly faster (i.e. disease severity and cognition) when compared to the referent
10 group (i.e. middle group; group 2 in Figure 13)), (b) those in the high end (group 3 in Figure 13)
   were stable over 12mo when treated with an anti-inflammatory drug when compared to the low
   end of the pro-inflammatory profile and the referent group.
   When considering disease severity (i.e. CDR Sum of Boxes [CDRSum]), the same was found.
   See Figure 14. Specifically, those in the low end of the pro-inflammatory profile who were
15 treated with an anti-inflammatory drug progressed in disease severity more rapidly over 12mo
   than any other group whereas those who were in that same biomarker-defined group declined
   minimally over 12 months if left untreated. On the other hand, those in the high end who were
   treated declined less than those who were untreated though the magnitude of difference is less
   than that observed from the objective cognitive measure above (i.e. MMSE scores).
20 These data demonstrate the effectiveness of the methods and now these methods will be applied
   to numerous other disease states (e.g. Multiple Sclerosis).
   Association of cognitive impairment with chronic kidney disease in Hispanics.
   Over the last 45 years, the Hispanic population in the United States has increased six-fold
   thereby making it the fastest growing segment of the population[l].      Unfortunately, Hispanics
25 experience a far greater incidence of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) than non-Hispanic whites.
   Data from the United States Renal Data System reveal that Hispanics have a 1.5 greater
   incidence of ESRD than non-Hispanic whites[2]. Despite a clear increase in the incidence of
   ESRD, the incidence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in the Hispanic population is equal to or

                                                  47
   even less than that of non-Hispanic whites[3, 4]. This would suggest that chronic kidney disease
   progresses faster to ESRD in the Hispanic population. The reason for this disparity is unclear.
   Analysis of data from both the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)
   1999-2008 and from the Northern California Kaiser Permanente health system, shows that
 5 Hispanics with diabetes have a greater level of urinary albumin excretion than non-Hispanic
   whites[5-7]. In the general CKD population, the degree of albuminuria has been clearly linked to
   progression of renal disease[8]. The greater degree of albuminuria in Hispanics may represent
   generalized endothelial dysfunction, which has been associated with mild cognitive impairment
   (MCI)[9]. Cognitive impairment has been linked to increased mortality in both the CKD and
10 non-CKD population[lO, 11]. MCI may effect heath literacy and lead to a decreased ability to
   adhere to preventative and therapeutic regimens[12].
   Hispanics appear to be at greater risk for cognitive impairment thai       non-Hispanics[13]. In
   addition "established" risk factors for MCI (hypertension, obesity, dyslipidemia, and APOE4
   genotype) have not been shown to be significant for Mexican-Americans[14]. Although it has
15 been well established that CKD is a risk factor for cognitive decline in the general
   population[15-18], there are few published studies demonstrating that CKD in Hispanics is
   associated with cognitive impairment[19, 20]. These studies, however, utilized only general
   screening tools to assess cognitive decline.
   There is a significant need to identify methods for the identification of CKD patients suffering
20 from MCI as well as pre-MCI and new treatment regimes based on the result outcomes. The
   present study sought to address this need by examining the link between CKD and
   cognition/MCI among a community-dwelling cohort of Mexican Americans. In addition, the
   inventors determined if serum proteomic markers from the inventors' previously generated
   blood-profile of AD could be utilized to generate a blood-profile of CKD-related cognitive
25 dysfunction.
   Participants. Data from 437 participants (105 men and 332 women) from the Health & Aging
   Brain among Latino Elders (HABLE) study were analyzed. The HABLE study is an ongoing
   epidemiological study of cognitive aging among community-dwelling Mexican American
   individuals. The HABLE study used a community-based participatory research (CBPR)
30 approach, which is a research methodology that involves partnering communities with scientific
   groups to conduct studies of human disease that is growing rapidly in terms of use and
   acceptance in the scientific community. The generation of locations for targeted CBPR
   recruitment was determined through analysis of zip codes in Tarrant County with the highest

                                                 48
   population density of Hispanic individuals. The research was conducted under an IRB approved
   protocol with each participant (and/or informants for cognitively impaired persons) providing
   written informed consent.
   Study Design. Each participant underwent an interview (i.e., medical history, medications,
 5 health behaviors), detailed neuropsychological testing, blood draw, and medical examination
   (review of systems, Hachinski Ischemic Index scale, brief neurological screen). The
   neuropsychological battery consisted of tests of executive functioning (Trail Making Test[25],
   EXIT25, clock drawing [CLOX1][26]), language (FAS and Animal Naming)[27], visuospatial
   skills (CLOX2[26]), memory (Wechsler MemoryScale - 3" ed Logical Memory, Consortium for
10 the Establishment of Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) List Learning[27]) and
   attention (WMS-3 Digit Span[28]). Testing was completed in English or Spanish depending on
   the participant's preference. Raw scores were utilized in analyses. The current team has
   generated normative references for each of these tests for English- and Spanish-speaking
   Mexican Americans for diagnostic purposes (manuscripts in preparation). Cognitive diagnoses
15 of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) were assigned according to Mayo Clinic criteria[29] by
   consensus review. Preliminary analyses were conducted on a subgroup of pre-MCI participants
   defined as normal controls with CERAD List Recall <1 standard deviation below the mean.
   Blood collection and processing. Fasting bloods were drawn for clinical laboratory analyses.
   eGFR was calculated using the CKD-epi formula. Serum samples were also collected and stored
20 in the biobank as follows: (1) serum samples were collected in I Oml tiger-top tubes, (2) allowed
   to clot for 30 minutes at room temperature in a vertical position, (3) centrifuged for 10 minutes
   at 1300 x g within one hour of collection, (4) 1.0 ml aliquots of serum were transferred into
   cryovial tubes, (5) FreezerworksTM barcode labels were firmly affixed to each aliquot, and (6)
   samples placed into -80* C freezer within two hours of collection for storage until use in an
25 assay.
   Biomarker assays. All samples were assayed in duplicate via a multi-plex biomarker assay
   platform using electrochemiluminesce (ECL) on the SECTOR Imager 2400A from Meso Scale
   Discovery (MSD; www.mesoscale.com). The MSD platform has been used extensively to assay
   biomarkers associated with a range of human diseases including AD [26-30]. ECL measures
30 have well-established properties of being more sensitive and requiring less sample volume than
   conventional ELISAs [30], the gold standard for most assays. The markers assayed were
   generated as described hereinabove and cross-validated AD algorithm [21-24] and included:
   fatty acid binding protein (FABP3), beta 2 microglobulin, pancreatic polypeptide (PPY),

                                                      49
   sTNFR I, CRP, VCAM I, thrombopocitin (THPO), a2 macroglobulin (A2M), exotaxin 3, tumor
   necrosis factor a, tenascin C, IL5, IL6, IL7, IL10, IL18, 1309, Factor VII, TARC, SAA, and
   ICAMI.
   Statistical analyses. The link between eGFR levels and neuropsychological outcomes was
 5 assessed via ANOVA (unadjusted models) and ANCOVA (covariates include age, gender,
   education). eGFR were divided into the following groups: <45, 45-59 and >=60 (ml/min/1.73
   m2 ). The link between serum biomarkers and MCI (and pre-MCI) status was examined via
   logistic regression (age, gender, education entered as covariates). All serum biomarkers were
   transformed using Box-Cox transformation.
10 The average age and education of the sample was 612 (sd=8.3; range = 50-91) and 7.7 (sd=4.3;
   range = 0-18), respectively. The average eGFR levels were 86.3 (sd=17.0; range = 21-123).
   eGFR categories were broken down as follows: <45 (n=14), 45-59 (n=20) & >=60 (n=403).
   Those with eGFR >=60 were significantly younger than the other two groups with the lower
   eGFR groups not being significantly different from one another. See Table 6 for demographic
15 characteristics of the cohort. A total of 83 participants were diagnosed as MCI.
   In the unadjusted models, lower eGFR levels were associated with significantly poorer
   performance in the domains of global cognition (MMSE), memory (WMS-3 LM and CERAD
   Recall), executive functioning (EXIT25, CLOXI), processing speed (Trials A), visuospatial
   skills (CLOX2), and language (Animal Naming) (see Table 6). In the adjusted models, the <45
20 group performed significantly worse than the 45-59 & >=60 groups in the following domains:
   processing speed (Trail Making Test part A, F=14.1, p<0.001), executive functioning (CLOXI,
   F=4.5, p=0.01), visuospatial skills (CLOX2, F=4.8, p<0.009) and global cognitive functioning
   (MMSE, F=6.2, p=0.002). Additionally, the eGFR<45 group performed significantly worse than
   the eGFR>=60 group on delayed memory (CERAD List Recall, F=3.8, p=0.02). The individual
25 mean I-J difference scores are shown in Table 7.

   (MCI n=68). In the logistic regression, a serum biomarker panel including only FVh, ILIO,
   CRP, and FABP (no demographic variables were included in the model) was 93% accurate at
   identifying those individuals with MCI in the eGFR<60 group (sensitivity = 86%, specificity =
 5 100%). The same set of markers was 85% accurate in detecting MCI in the eGFR>=60 group;
   however, this was biased by the 98% specificity but only 24% sensitivity. When examining only
   those with normal cognition, within the eGFR<60 group, 3 were classified as pre-MCI whereas
   49 pre-MCI cases were identified within the eGFR>=60 group. The same algorithm was 100%
   correct at identifying the pre-MCI cases within the eGFR<60 group; however, none of the pre
10 MCI cases were correctly identified with the serum biomarkers in the eGFR>=60 group.
   Numerous studies have clearly demonstrated the association between mild cognitive impairment
   and chronic kidney disease [15-18]. The decline in cognitive function affects all domains
   including executive function, verbal memory, visuospatial skills and attention span. The present
   invention demonstrates that the degree of cognitive impairment appears to be positively related
15 to the severity of the renal disease. The worst the renal function the greater the cognitive deficit.
   In addition, cognitive impairment was found to progress more rapidly in patients with CKD, thus
   requiring more aggressive treatments and intervention.

                                                     52
   The association of cognitive impairment with CKD is not surprising. Many of the same risk
   factors are responsible for both. Dementia in patients with CKD is of the vascular type and not
   Alzheimer's type. Yet even after adjusting for numerous cardiovascular risk factors, CKD
   remains an independent risk factor for cognitive impairment [19]. A common underpinning may
 5 be endothelial dysfunction, which is associated with both MCI and CKD[9].             Endothelial
   dysfunction can be caused by both inflammatory and metabolic determinants.
   This study is the first to characterize the CKD-MCI relationship in a Mexican American
   population utilizing detailed neuropsychological         testing. Previous studies showing the
   association of CKD with MCI used only general brief screening tests [19, 20]. For the first time
10 the present invention permits a more complete understanding of MCI in Mexican Americans
   with CKD and the change in treatment regime due to these results obtained herein using the
   present invention. Cognitive decline worsens disease outcomes. Mexican Americans are the
   fasting growing segment of the U.S. population. They are also burdened with excess prevalence
   of end-stage renal disease. This excess risk may be due to socio-economic factors, poor health
15 literacy, poorer diabetic control, lesser use of appropriate medications and worse blood pressure
   control[31-33]. At any stage of CKD Hispanics have higher levels of proteinuria than their non
   Hispanic counterparts, suggesting a greater degree of endothelial dysfunction.
   The present invention also demonstrates that a serum biomarker panel including FVII, IL1O,
   CRP, and FABP is 93% accurate at identifying MCI among individuals with CKD (sensitivity =
20 86%, specificity    =  100%). ILIO and CRP are markers of inflammation whereas FABP is
   strongly related to metabolic functioning. As shown hereinabove and in the inventors' prior
   work the biomarker profile of AD among Mexican Americans, the profile was heavily weighted
   towards metabolic factors (e.g. FABP, GLP-1, PPY) whereas it is shown herein that the
   biomarker profile of CKD-related MCI is largely inflammatory in nature. Therefore, the CKD
25 MCI profile is significantly different than the AD profile among Mexican Americans.
   Additionally, the CKD-MCI profile did not predict MCI among Mexican Americans not
   suffering from CKD. Interestingly, inflammation has been a key factor in the AD biomarker
   profile among non-Hispanics. This study further highlights the urgent need to refine the MCI
   nosology, specifically by recognizing the condition and then using that information to target the
30 medical conditions with the correct treatment to impact cognition. As shown herein, the
   biornarker profile of MCI will vary significantly from one condition (e.g. diabetes-related MCI)
   to the next (i.e. CKD-related MCI) and interventions targeting cognition will likely need to be
   different as a result.

                                                     53
   Because of the differences not only in the rate of progression of renal disease but also in the risk
   factors for MCI in Hispanics, it is important to study this ethnic group in more detail in order to
   validate this specific group of blood-based biomarkers. Such studies will enable us to better
   characterize the association between CKD and MCI and enable us to develop better targeted
 5 interventions to prevent or at least slow the progression of CKD and MCI.
