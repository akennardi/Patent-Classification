                                            Technical Field
            The invention described herein relates to a system for managing displays. In
    particular, embodiments of the invention are directed to an online system for
    managing retail store displays, stock on show, boxed stock in specific planogram (POG)
 5  layout to ensure consistency across all retail stores.
                                           Background Art
            In the competitive retail industry, it is increasingly more important for
    retailers/brands to design their stores to engage shoppers and optimise their shopping
   experience. Many retailers/brands are often faced with the task of making use of
10 space more effectively and creatively whilst minimising wasted space, presenting
   products and services more attractively to optimise attention and selection to thereby
   create an enjoyable and relatable experience for customers and to ultimately boost
   sales and have a consistent presence across all retail stores.
            Embodiments of the invention provide a system and method which assists
15 retailers/brands     to effectively design and       manage    retail storage and   display
   assemblies/POGs in a photo realistic medium.
                                     Summary of the Invention
            According to one aspect of the invention, there is provided a system for
   managing a retail display, the system including
20          a first repository for storing one or more storage assembly representations,
            a second repository for storing one or more product representations,
            a converter for converting the storage assembly and product representations
   to scale representations of respective storage assemblies and products, and
            a workspace       in which     one   or   more   user   selected   product  scaled
25 representations can be positioned relative to one or more user selected storage
   assembly scaled representations to provide a to scale visual representation of the
   retail display.

                                               -2
           The system may include an online application, the online application providing
   a visual interface which allows a user to configure a to scale visual representation of a
   retail display by selecting one or more desired storage assembly representations and
   placing one or more product representations relative to the selected storage assembly
 5 representations in the workspace.
           The storage assembly and product representations may be 2D or 3D images of
   the respective storage assemblies and products. The representations may be 3D
   models of the respective storage assemblies and products. In one embodiment, the
   representations may be generated based on photographs of the storage assemblies
10 and products.
           The storage assembly representations may include various shelving and display
   assemblies. The products may be retail products such as kitchen and other home
   appliances, food, toiletries, cosmetics, clothing, shoes, accessories and the like.
           The system may allow the creation of one or more user accounts, and the
15 system may be configured to provide user specific storage assembly and product
   representations for each user account.
           The system may further allow a user to upload one or more product files, and
   the converter converts the product files to scaled product representations. In this
   manner, the system may allow the user to create a library of product representations
20 relevant to a retail outlet.
           The system may allow the user to select from a list of available storage
   assembly     representations,   and drag-and-drop      and selected     storage assembly
   representation into the workspace. Moreover, the system may allow the user to select
   from a list of available product representations, and drag-and-drop one or more
25 selected product representations into the workspace. The system may restrict
   placement of the product representations to suitable areas of the storage assembly
   representation.
           The system may further include an output module for generating an output file
   of the workspace. The output file may be in any suitable file format. In one
30 embodiment, the output file is a PDF file.
           According to another aspect of the invention, there is provided a method for
   managing a retail display, the method including

                                                     -3
            creating a first library of a first library of storage assembly representations,
            creating a second library of product representations,
            converting the storage assembly and product representations to scaled
   representations of the respective storage assemblies and products, and
 5          selecting a storage assembly representation and a product representation, and
            positioning the selected product representation relative to selected storage
   assembly representation so as to provide a to scale visual representation of the retail
   display.
            Advantageously, the method provides users such as retailers/brands with a
10 useful tool to plan, manage and select appropriate storage and display assemblies for
   their retail outlets. The scaled representations allow the retailer to select the
   appropriate storage and display assembly for the available retail space and products
   on display. The system also provides convenient output of the workspace once
   complete so as to allow retail teams to more conveniently and efficiently communicate
15 internally with team members, and collaborate externally with storage assembly
   suppliers and interior designers to achieve the most optimal and desired display
   assembly.
            In order that the invention may be more readily understood and put into
   practice, one or more preferred embodiments thereof will now be described, by way
20 of example only, with reference to the accompanying drawings.

15                     Detailed Description of Preferred Embodiment(s)
           As shown in Figure 1, the system 100 according to one embodiment of the
   invention includes a system server 102, one or more user devices including a PC 104
   and a mobile device 106, and a system administrator 110. The system server 102 hosts
   an online application 200 as configured by the system administrator 110 and as further
20 described in detail below. The online application 200 provides a user interface 202 via
   the personal computer 104 and/or mobile device 106, through which a user can access
   and interact with the online application 200 via a network 108 such as the internet.
   The system administrator 110 may access the server 102 via the internet or a local
   network.
25         The online application 200 includes a first repository for storing a plurality of
   storage assembly representations, and a second repository for storing a plurality of
   product representations, a converter for converting the representations to scaled

                                                -5
   representations     and  a workspace       in which   a user    can combine     selected
   representations in a desirable arrangement.
           As more clearly shown in Figure 2, the online application 200 provides a
   graphical user interface 202. The interface 202 provides a workspace 204 in which a
 5 user can plan the arrangement of a retail space. In particular, the application 200
   allows various scaled product representations 206 to be selected from a library 208,
   and moved into the workspace 204 by drag-and-drop. The product representations
   206 can be positioned over a scaled representation of a previously selected storage
   assembly representation 210.
10         Preferably, the system allows each user to create a user account and libraries
   of customised product and storage assembly representations 206, 210 can be created
   by a system administrator 110 and/or the user 104, 106 via the online application 202.
           To create a library of scaled storage assembly representations, image files such
   as photographs or 3D models of each storage assembly can be uploaded via a file
15 upload function 302 of the user interface 202 as shown in Figure 3A. The storage
   assembly representation can be assigned a label via text field 304 and a store name via
   drop down menu 306. The label 304 may be a location or any other suitable identifier
   for the     storage   assembly.    In one embodiment,       custom   storage   assembly
   representations are created by system administrators 110 for a specific retail
20 client/user, and the retail store location 304 and name 306 is used to identify the
   custom storage assembly representations. The storage assembly representations are
   created to scale by the system administrator 110 and a pixel/millimetre scaling ratio is
   determined and saved by the online application 200 based on the known dimensions
   of respective storage assemblies. For example, a length of 1000mm in relation a
25 physical storage assembly may correspond with 666 pixels of a storage assembly
   image. The scaling ratio in this example is therefore 0.66.
           As shown in Figure 4A, a 3D rendering of a storage assembly scaled
   representation 400 is shown in a workspace 204. As shown in Figure 4B, areas of the
   representation 400 corresponding to storage areas 402 of the storage assembly 404
30 are identified so that product representations can only be placed over the defined
   storage areas 402.

                                               -6
            To create a library of scaled product representations, image files such as
   photographs of the product 500 (Figure 5A) can be uploaded via a file upload function
   308 of the user interface 202 as shown in Figure 3B. The product representation can be
   assigned a name or model number via text field 310 and a product type via drop down
 5 menu 312. The product types in the drop down menu 312 may be predefined and may
   include any number of product types. For example, typical kitchen appliances product
   types may include blender, toaster, food processor, kettle and the like.
            Once the image file is uploaded, a converter (not shown) of the online
   application 200 renders and adjusts the size of the image according to the same scaling
10 ratio (i.e. 0.66) as that used for the storage assemblies 400 so as to convert the
   uploaded images to scaled product representations. For example, a 400mm high
   product would be scaled to 400 x 0.66 = 264 pixels high in the interface 202. An
   example rendered and scaled product representation 502 of a mixer is shown in Figure
   5B.
15          By applying the same scaling ratio to both the               storage assembly
   representations and the product representations, the products can be shown in the
   workspace 204 in the correct proportion relative to the storage assemblies. Once all
   representations in both the first and second libraries are converted according to the
   same scaling ratio, the online application 200 is able to adjust the workspace and
20 visual interface according to different screen sizes and resolutions of different user
   devices 104, 106.
            Figure 3C illustrates a text search field 314 which can be used by a user to
   search for product representations 502 from the second library 208.
            As shown in Figured 6 and 7, a user can drag and drop selected product
25 representations 502 into the defined storage areas 402 of the storage assembly
   representation 404 to design and plan a display assembly in a retail outlet. The
   interface 202 may provide a "snap to location" function which assists the user to move
   the product representations 502 to the appropriate locations within the storage areas
   402, for example, so as to avoid overlapping and/or uneven spacing between the
30 product representations 502.
            Once the workspace is complete, as shown in Figure 7, an output file such as a
   PDF file of the completed workspace can be generated.

                                              -7
           A method of managing a retail display 600 will now be explained with reference
   to Figure 8.
           At step 602, a new user account is created. The new user account may be the
   manager or owner of a retail outlet.
 5         At step 604, a system administrator 110 creates a first library of scaled storage
   assembly representations 404 suitable for the retail outlet of the new user. The
   representations 404 are saved in the first repository of the system 100.
           At step 606, a system administrator 110 and/or the user 104, 106 creates a
   second library of scaled product representations 502. The representations 502 are
10 saved in the second repository of the system 100.
           At step 608, the user creates a to-scale retail display layout by selecting and
   placing product representations 502 in defined storage areas 402 of a selected storage
   assembly representation 404 in the workspace 204 of the online application 200.
           At step 610, the workspace is complete and an output PDF file of the complete
15 workspace is generated.
           The system 100 therefore provides retailers with a useful tool to plan, manage
   and select appropriate storage and display assemblies for their retail outlets. The
   scaled representations allows the retailer to select the appropriate storage and display
   assembly for the available retail space and products on display. The system also
20 provides convenient output file of the completed workspace so as to allow retail teams
   to more conveniently and efficiently communicate internally, and collaborate
   externally with storage assembly suppliers and interior designers to achieve the most
   optimal and desired display assembly.
           In some alternative embodiments, the system may provide a plan view of the
25 floor space for a particular retail store so that the user can select the most suitable
   type and sized storage assembly for the floor space, or a portion of the floor space,
   and determine the products to be stored on each storage assembly, thereby providing
   an effective tool for a retailer to plan and achieve product storage solutions for an
   entire retail store.
30         In some alternative embodiments, the workspace may allow users to move and
   rotate storage assemblies and products, and navigate around a retail floor space to
   move between storage assemblies.

                                               -8
