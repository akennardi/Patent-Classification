                                     Multifunctional Cosmetic Bag
TECHNICAL FIELD
      The disclosure relates to the technical field of cosmetic containers, in particular to a multifunctional
cosmetic bag.
BACKGROUND ART
      Most of the current cosmetic bags are used in the form of a bag in which cosmetic accessories directly stored
and stacked together. Such a solution does not solve the problem of easy collision between cosmetics, and fails to
protect fragile and expensive cosmetics, so that such cosmetic bags are not only exposed to inadequate protection,
but also inconvenient to carry.
      Therefore, it is very important to redesign a cosmetic bag that is highly protected, portable, durable and easy
to clean. At the same time, it can also re-design the storage space according to individual needs, so that local
spaces in the bag can be freely combined.
SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE
      To solve the above shortcomings of the prior art, the disclosure provides a multifunctional cosmetic bag, in
which the storage space can be freely combined and upper and lower parts are divided for easy arrangement and
classification of the cosmetics.
      To achieve the above purpose, the technical scheme of the disclosure is as follows:
      A multifunctional cosmetic bag includes a cosmetic bag cover and an accessory case, wherein the bottom
end of the cosmetic bag cover is connected to the accessory case; a sewing chain is provided on the respective
edge of the cosmetic bag cover and the accessory case; zippers are provided between the sewing chains; two
elastic tapes are further provided between the cosmetic bag cover and the accessory case; the cosmetic bag cover
is provided with a black light plastic, and is further provided with second brush bags overlying the black light
plastic; the outer layer of the second brush bags are provided with the corresponding first brush bags; the first
brush bags on the left and right sides are provided respectively with an adhesive tape; six of the first brush bags
and the second brush bags are respectively provided: the cosmetic bag cover is provided with a covering layer,
and is further provided with a interlayer zipper on the right side; the accessory case is provided with an outer
plastic frame inside, which is fixedly engaged to EVA boards, wherein the EVA boards are provided with
engagement grooves and engagement buckles, and can be fixedly engaged to each other; the bottom end of the
accessory case is further provided with an external sleeve.

                                                 DESCRIPTION
     For a further description of the disclosure, the cosmetic bag cover is a type of interlayer cover, which can be
opened or closed by pulling the interlayer zipper.
     For a further description of the disclosure, the covering layer is further provided with an adhesive strip
bonded to the adhesive tape.
     For a further description of the disclosure, the EVA board is made of EVA plastic.
     For a further description of the disclosure, the accessory case is further provided with a handle on the
outside.
     For a further description of the disclosure, the outer plastic frame is made of EVA sandwiched wood board
with high density.
     For a further description of the disclosure, the outer plastic frame can be detached from the accessory case.
     For a further description of the disclosure, the outer plastic frame is provided with engagement grooves
corresponding to the engagement buckles.
     Compared with the prior art, the disclosure has the following beneficial effects:
     (1)  The space in the cosmetic bag according to the disclosure can be freely combined through fixing with
engagement grooves to ensure that a variety of shapes and sizes of cosmetics and cosmetic accessories are
applicable;
     (2)  The cosmetics and cosmetic accessories can be protected from the shocking, squeezing and pressing
caused by the external force through the EVA board fixedly engaged to the outer plastic frame, in order to ensure
the high safety of cosmetics and cosmetic accessories;
     (3) The problem of how to sort and classify cosmetics and cosmetic accessories properly can be solved
with the various shapes of areas divided at one's option by means of the EVA boards;
     (4)  The problems of cosmetic bags that are easy to be stained and are not durable can be solved with the
design of the black light plastic due to its easy-cleaning property.
     (5)  The use of the elastic tape may fix the upper and lower parts of the cosmetic bag, thus eliminating the
need for artificial support.
