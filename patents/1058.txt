   ABSTRACT
   A latch mechanism for latching a slidable panel to a fixed member is disclosed. The
   latch mechanism including a housing mountable on one of the slidable panel and the
   fixed member; at least one latching member mounted in the housing, the at least one
 5 latching member being movable between a first position for engaging with the other of
   the slidable panel and the fixed member, and a second disengaged position; and a
   reconfigurable operative mechanism which is selectively reconfigurable to move the at
   least one latching member between the first and second positions, wherein the
   reconfigurable operative mechanism includes first and second projectable portions at
10 opposite ends or sides of the housing which are selectively user operable to reconfigure
   the operative mechanism and move the at least one latching member, wherein the first
   and second projectable portions each include indicator portions, each of the first and
   second projectable portions being movable between an extended position projecting
   from the housing and a retracted position relative to the extended position, such that the
15 movement of the projectable portions between the extended and retracted positions
   results in the indicator portions being respectively uncovered and covered by the
   housing, such that when one of the first and second projectable portions projects out of
   the housing the extended position, the other of the first and second projectable portions
   is fully received in the housing in the retracted position.

                                      Field of the invention
           The present invention relates to latch mechanisms for releasably latching a
   slidable panel, such as a slidable door or window, to a fixed member, such as a frame.
 5                                Background of the invention
           Australian patent no. 2003252202 discloses a latch mechanism for a slidable
   door or panel. The latch mechanism includes a housing having a pair of user-operable
   control knobs projecting at opposite ends of the housing, and a pair of latch tongues or
   hooks movable between an extended position in which the latch tongues extend from
10 the housing and are engageable with a fixed member, such as a door frame, and a
   retracted position relative to the extended position in which the latch tongues are
   located in the housing. The latch tongues are caused to move between the extended
   and retracted positions due to the sliding movement of a pair of slidable members
   located within the housing, each control knob being integral with, or connected to, one
15 of the slidable members. The slidable members include rack gears and are coupled by
   a central pinion gear. The arrangement is such that movement of one of the slidable
   members (or the control knob thereof) in a first direction causes movement of the other
   slidable member (and therefore, the other control knob) in a second, opposite, direction.
           The abovedescribed latch mechanism suffers from certain disadvantages. For
20 example, an unfamiliar user of the latch mechanism may be unaware which control
   knob must be actuated to move the latch tongues between the extended and retracted
   position, or even if a choice of the control knob is required (i.e., the unfamiliar user is
   unaware that each control knob performs the same operation). Additionally, there is no
   indication to the unfamiliar user, save for the position of the control knobs (of which the
25 user is not familiar), whether the latch mechanism is latched or unlatched (i.e., whether
   the latch tongues are in the extended or retracted position). As such, the unfamiliar user
   will be required to visually inspect the latch tongues and/or attempt to move the slidable
   door or panel to determine the latching state of the latch mechanism.
                                                     1

           It is an object of the present invention to provide a latch mechanism for latching a
   slidable panel to a fixed member that overcomes, or at least ameliorates, one or more of
   abovementioned disadvantages, or is at least a useful design choice over known latch
   mechanisms.
 5         Reference to any prior art in the specification is not an acknowledgment or
   suggestion that this prior art forms part of the common general knowledge in any
   jurisdiction or that this prior art could reasonably be expected to be understood,
   regarded as relevant, and/or combined with other pieces of prior art by a skilled person
   in the art.
10                                   Summary of the invention
           In accordance with an aspect of the present invention, there is provided a latch
   mechanism for latching a slidable panel to a fixed member, the latch mechanism
   including:
           a housing mountable on one of the slidable panel and the fixed member;
15         at least one latching member mounted in the housing, the at least one latching
   member being movable between a first position for engaging with the other of the
   slidable panel and the fixed member, and a second disengaged position; and
           a reconfigurable operative mechanism which is selectively reconfigurable to
   move the at least one latching member between the first and second positions,
20         wherein the reconfigurable operative mechanism includes first and second
   projectable portions at opposite ends or sides of the housing which are selectively user
   operable to reconfigure the operative mechanism and move the at least one latching
   member,
           wherein the first and second projectable portions each include indicator portions,
25 each of the first and second projectable portions being movable between an extended
   position projecting from the housing and a retracted position relative to the extended
   position, such that the movement of the projectable portions between the extended and
   retracted positions results in the indicator portions being covered or uncovered by the
   housing,
                                                      2

           such that when one of the first and second projectable portions projects out of
   the housing in the extended position, the other of the first and second projectable
   portions is fully received in the housing in the retracted position.
           When uncovered, the indicator portion becomes visible to the user.
 5         The first and second projectable portions may move in synchronicity such that
   when the first projectable portion is in the extended position, the second projectable
   portion is in the retracted position and vice versa.
           The projectable portions may be in the form of push buttons with the indicator
   portions provided therein or thereon, e.g. in the form of a tab. Each indicator portion
10 may be centrally disposed on its associated push button.
           The projectable portions may be incorporated into or form an integral part of one
   or more slidable members which form part of the reconfigurable operative mechanism.
   In a preferred form of the invention, there is a single slidable member having a
   longitudinal axis with the slidable member sliding longitudinally relative to the housing.
15 With the single slidable member, the projectable portions or push buttons are suitably
   disposed at opposite ends of the slidable member and at opposite ends of the housing.
           The single slidable member may be arranged in the housing in a first orientation
   or a second orientation, the second orientation being offset 1800 about a transverse
   axis of the slidable member from the first orientation. As such, in the first orientation, the
20 first projectable portion may project from the housing at a first end or side of the housing
   when in the extended position, and in the second orientation, the first projectable portion
   may project from the housing at a second end or side of the housing when in the
   extended position, the second end or side being opposite to the first end or side.
   Furthermore, in the first orientation, the second projectable portion may project from the
25 second end or side of the housing when in the extended position, and in the second
   orientation, the second projectable portion may project from the first end or side of the
   housing when in the extended position. Advantageously therefore, a user of the latch
   mechanism may arrange a selected one of the indicator portions at either the first end
   or side of the housing or at the second opposite end or side of the housing, as the user
30 desires.
                                                     3

          The indicator portions will be alternately visible and covered depending on the
   position of the single slidable member. For instance, when the position of the slidable
   member corresponds to the engaged position of the at least one latching member, the
   projecting indicator portion may indicate this latching state, for example by a red
 5 coloured indicator portion being exposed. On the other hand, when the position of the
   slidable member corresponds to the disengaged position of the at least one latching
   member, then the indicator portion which is visible and uncovered by projecting beyond
   the housing, may indicate an unlatched state and may be in the form of a green
   coloured indicator portion.
10        The single slidable member arrangement is only one possible arrangement for
   the reconfigurable operative mechanism. It may be possible to have two or more
   slidable members which act in concert with opposite projectable portions of the two or
   more slidable members defining the projectable portions. For example, where there are
   two slidable members, one projectable portion may be arranged on each slidable
15 member with the two projectable portions arranged at opposite ends of the housing. The
   reconfigurable operative mechanism may enable the slidable members to move in
   opposite directions. See for example US Patent 7,228,719, the disclosure of which is
   incorporated herein by reference.
           Preferably the arrangement of the indicator portions is such that when one of the
?0 projectable portions extends out of the housing, the associated indicator portion is
   exposed and thereby visible. However, alternative arrangements are possible where
   there are viewing windows provided in the housing and the indicator portion is visible,
   depending upon the position of the associated projectable portion.
          The indicator portion may simply comprise painted portions on the projectable
25 portions/push buttons. Alternatively, the indicator portion may be formed by over
   moulding of a coloured plastic component into the projectable portion/push button. The
   form of the push button may be a plastic moulded component provided at the end of a
   metal bar forming the slidable member. The push button may be over-moulded onto the
   metal slidable member.
30        The reconfigurable operative mechanism may be operable internally e.g. from an
   internal side of the slidable panel and this is suitably achieved by user manipulation of
                                                    4

   the projectable portions. The operative mechanism may also be operable externally, for
   example from outside of the slidable panel, for example, by an external actuator or lock,
   such as a key-operated lock. Any reference to "an internal side of the slidable panel" or
   similar and "an external side of the slidable panel" or similar respectively refers to a first
 5 space or environment, such as a room, and a second space or environment, such as a
   space outside of the room, the first and second spaces being separated by the slidable
   panel.
          A deadlock may also be provided to preclude internal operation by the
   projectable portions or push buttons, unless the deadlock is de-activated, suitably by a
10 key. Thus, the reconfigurable operative mechanism is selectively reconfigurable. This
   may take account of the operation of the deadlock as to whether the operative
   mechanism is reconfigurable at any particular time.
          The at least one latching member may be in the form of a latch tongue. Suitably,
   there are two latch tongues which rotate in synchronism in opposite rotational directions
15 about respective rotational axes as is known in the art. In a preferred form of the
   invention, the latch mechanism is provided on the slidable panel and the latching
   member(s) is engageable with a striker plate, suitably provided on a door jamb.
          As used herein, except where the context requires otherwise, the term
   "comprise" and variations of the term, such as "comprising", "comprises" and
?0 "comprised", are not intended to exclude further additives, components, integers or
   steps.

                                                   6

                             Detailed description of the embodiments
            Referring to Figures 1A and 1B, there is a shown a latch mechanism 10
   according to an embodiment of the invention. The latch mechanism 10 is disposed
   within a generally rectangular handle housing 12. The handle housing 12 may be
 5 mounted upon one of a slidable panel or a fixed member (not shown) for releasably
   latching the slidable panel and fixed member. As is typical in the art, the slidable panel
   may be a slidable door or window, and the fixed member may be a fixed door or window
   frame. Although the handle housing 12 of Figures 1A and 1B is generally rectangular, a
   person skilled in the art will appreciate that the latch mechanism 10 of the present
10 invention may be disposed within a variety of differently shaped handle housings (see
   Figures 9A and 9B for example), and that the illustrated housing 12 is merely
   exemplary. Furthermore, a person skilled in the art will appreciate that the handle
   housing 12 may be integral with (as opposed to being mounted upon) one of the
   slidable panel and fixed member.
15         The latch mechanism 10 includes a pair of similar latching members in the form
   of hook-like latch tongues 14 (Figure 1B). The latch tongues 14 are mounted within the
   housing 12 and are rotatably movable between a first position (Figure 1B) for engaging,
   for example a keeper component (not shown), on the other of the slidable panel or fixed
   member (to which the housing 12 is not mounted upon), and a second, disengaged,
?0 position (Figure 1A). In the first position, the latch mechanism 10 releasably latches the
   slidable panel and the fixed member, whereas in the second position, the slidable panel
   and the fixed member are unlatched or disengaged.
           The latch mechanism         10 includes a reconfigurable operative mechanism
   including an elongate slidable member 16 (Figure 4). As is described in detail later, the
25 slidable member 16 is reconfigurable by sliding to move the latch tongues 14 between
   the first and second positions. Referring to Figure 4, the slidable member 16 includes, at
   a first end 18, a first projectable portion in the form of a first push button 22. The slidable
   member 16 also includes, at a second opposite end 20, a second projectable portion in
   the form of a second push button 24. The first and second push buttons 22, 24 are
30 selectively user operable, by pushing or pressing, to reconfigure the slidable member 16
   and move the latch tongues 14 between the first and second positions.
                                                       7

           As is illustrated in Figures 1A and 1B, the first and second push buttons 22, 24
   are movable between an extended position projecting from an end or side of the
   housing 12, and a retracted position relative to the extended position. Particularly, when
   the first push button 22 is in the extended position projecting out of the housing 12, the
 5 second push button 24 is fully received in the housing 12 in the retracted position
   (Figure 1A), and vice versa. The first and second push buttons 22, 24 move in
   synchronicity between the extended and retracted positions.
           Advantageously, each of the first and second push buttons 22, 24 include
   respective first and second indicator portions 26, 28 that are respectively uncovered or
10 covered by the housing 12 as the push buttons 22, 24 are moved between the extended
   and retracted positions. When uncovered, the first or second indicator portion 26, 28
   becomes visible to the user and indicates a latching state of the latch mechanism 10. In
   a preferred form of the invention, the first indicator portion 26 is coloured green and the
   second indicator portion 28 is coloured red. Accordingly, when the position of the
15 slidable member 16 corresponds to the first or engaged position of the latch tongues 14
   (Figure 1B), the projecting push button 24 indicates this latching state by the red
   indicator portion 28 being visible to the user. On the other hand, when the position of
   the slidable member 16 corresponds to the second or disengaged position of the latch
   tongues 14 (Figure 1A), the projecting push button 22 indicates this unlatched state by
?0 the green indicator portion 26 being visible to the user. When the green indicator portion
   26 is uncovered and visible, the red indicator portion 28 is covered by the housing 12
   and is not visible, and vice versa.
           The various components of the latch mechanism 10 will now be described in
   greater detail.
25         Referring initially to Figure 4, the slidable member 16 is elongate and generally
   rectangular in overall form and includes approximately T-shaped opposite first and
   second outer ends 18, 20 respectively aligned along a longitudinal axis. Each T-shaped
   end 18, 20 includes a generally rounded-rectangular aperture 30 centrally disposed in
   the transverse portion of the "T" of each end 18, 20. Releasably mounted at each end
30 18, 20 are the respective first and second push buttons 22, 24. The push buttons 22, 24
   are rectangular prisms having a closed top end 32 adapted to be pushed/pressed by a
                                                      8

   finger, and an opposite open bottom end 34 adapted to be mounted over the T-shaped
   ends 18, 20 of the slidable member 16. The push buttons 22, 24 also include a
   generally rounded-rectangular aperture or slot 36 on a front face 38, the apertures 36
   being similar in overall dimension to the centrally disposed aperture 30 of T-shaped
 5 ends 18, 20. The push buttons 22, 24 are mounted upon the T-shaped ends 18, 20 and
   respectively secured thereto by the first, green, and second, red, indicator portions 26,
   28, the indicator portions 26, 28 being dimensioned to slidably fit into the aligned
   apertures 36, 30 of the push buttons 22, 24 and the T-shaped ends 18, 20 of the
   slidable member 16. In other words, the push buttons 22, 24 are secured to the outer
10 ends 18, 20 of the slidable member 16 by the respective indicator portions 26, 28 being
   interference fit into the aligned apertures 36, 30. In this manner, the indicator portions
   are visible (when uncovered by the housing 12) on the front face 38 of each push button
   22, 24.
           The slidable member 16 also includes a first, outer, pair of generally oblong slots
15 40 arranged along the longitudinal axis of the slidable member 16, and a second, inner,
   pair of generally oblong slots 42 disposed inwardly of the outer slots 40 (i.e., toward the
   longitudinal and transverse centre of the slidable member 16). The second oblong slots
   42 are smaller in overall dimension as compared to the first oblong slots 40, and each
   second slot 42 is arranged offset from the longitudinal axis toward an opposite
?0 longitudinal side of the slidable member 16. Specifically, as is illustrated in Figure 4, an
   upper one of the second slots 42 is arranged offset from the longitudinal axis toward a
   first longitudinal side 44 of the slidable member 16, and a lower one of the second slots
   is arranged offset from the longitudinal axis toward a second, opposite, longitudinal side
   46 of the slidable member 16. Each of the first and second slots 40, 42 define a slide
25 path of the slidable member 16, as is discussed below.
           The slidable member 16 is mounted upon a generally rectangular mounting plate
   50. The mounting plate 50 includes a pair of cylindrical bosses 52 aligned along a
   longitudinal axis of the mounting plate 50 and arranged adjacent opposite outer
   longitudinal ends of the mounting plate 50. The cylindrical bosses 52 are dimensioned
30 to be slidably located in the first, outer, pair of slots 40 of the slidable member 16. In this
   manner, the slidable member 16 is slidably mounted upon the mounting plate 50 about
   the cylindrical bosses 52. As is shown in Figures 2A and 2B, the slidable member 16 is
                                                       9

   slidable between a position corresponding to the first, engaging, position of the latch
   members 14 (Figure 2B) and a position corresponding to the second, disengaged,
   position of the latch members 14 (Figure 2A). In the engaging position, the cylindrical
   bosses 52 are located at a first longitudinal end of the slots 40, and in the disengaged
 5 position, the cylindrical bosses 52 are located at a second opposite longitudinal end of
   the slots 40. As is described above, the slidable member 16 is slidable between the
   engaging position and the disengaged position by a pushing/pressing force on either of
   the first and second push buttons 22, 24. In this manner, the slidable member 16 is
   operable internally, i.e. from an internal side of the slidable panel (not shown) by user
10 manipulation of the push buttons 22, 24. The slidable member 16 is also operable
   externally, i.e. from outside of the slidable panel by a key-operated lock, discussed later.
           The mounting plate 50 also includes a ball detent 220 at a lower end thereof that
   projects laterally from a side of the mounting plate 50 closest to the first longitudinal side
   44 of the slidable member 16 (Figure 4). The ball detent 220 is adapted to engage
15 either an upper side 222a or lower side 222b of a generally semi-circular projection 222
   projecting from the first longitudinal side 44 nearest a lower end of the slidable member
   16. The ball detent 220 and semi-circular projection 222 are dimensioned and
   configured such that a minimum positive pushing/pressing force on the push buttons 22,
   24 is required to move the projection 222 about or around the ball detent 220, thereby
?0 allowing the slidable member 16 to move between engaging and disengaged positions.
   In essence, the ball detent 220 prevents accidental or unintended movement of the
   latch tongues 14 between the engaging and disengaged positions until a positive
   pushing/pressing force is applied to the push buttons 22, 24.
           Mounted upon the cylindrical bosses 52, between the slidable member 16 and
25 mounting plate 50, are the pair of hook-like latch tongues 14. The latch tongues 14
   include a generally circular portion 60 and an integral radially extending generally L
   shaped hook portion 62. The circular portion 60 includes a slot 64 having a central
   circular aperture 66 and radially extending generally L-shaped ends 68 extending in
   opposite directions from a common axis from the central aperture 66. The central
30 aperture 66 is dimensioned to be mounted upon the cylindrical bosses 52 of the
   mounting plate 50, and one of the L-shaped ends 68 is dimensioned to receive a
   generally rectangular tab 70 located within, and extending through, the first pair of
                                                    10

   generally oblong slots 40 of the slidable member 16. As can be seen in Figure 4, a
   lower one of the first slots 40 of the slidable member 16 includes the rectangular tab 70
   on a side of the lower slot 40 closest the second longitudinal side 46 of the slidable
   member 16, and an upper one of the first slots 40 includes the rectangular tab 70 on a
 5 side of the upper slot 40 closest the first, opposite, longitudinal side 44 of the slidable
   member 16. As the slidable member 16 is caused to slide upon the mounting plate 50
   by the pushing/pressing force on either of the first and second push buttons 22, 24, the
   latch tongues 14 are caused to rotate in synchronism in opposite rotational directions
   about rotational axes defined by the central apertures 66 and the cylindrical bosses 52
10 due to the rectangular tabs 70 of the slidable member 16 being located in the L-shaped
   ends 68 of the latch tongues 14.
           The latch mechanism 10 also includes a locking element in the form of a
   generally L-shaped member 80 (Figure 4), the L-shaped locking member 80 being
   configured to releasably lock the slidable member 16 in either of the positions
15 corresponding to the engaging and disengaged positions of the latch tongues 14. The
   locking member 80, similar to the latch tongues 14, is disposed between the slidable
   member 16 and the mounting plate 50. The locking member 80 includes at a first,
   upper, end 82 a circular aperture 84 which receives a first generally circular pin 86
   about which the locking member 80 is pivotally mounted to the mounting plate 50. The
?0 first, upper, end 82 of the locking member 80 is opposite to a second, lower, end 94
   adjacent to the "bend" in the L-shaped member.
            The locking member 80 is secured between the slidable member 16 and the
   mounting plate 50 by the circular pin 86 being received through the upper one of the
   second, inner, pair of generally oblong slots 42 of the slidable member 16, the circular
25 aperture 84 of the locking member 80, and an upper circular aperture 88 located on the
   mounting plate 50 disposed below an upper one of the cylindrical bosses 52. The
   circular pin 86 includes a first, outer, portion 90 having a first diameter corresponding to
   a diameter of the circular aperture 88 of the mounting plate 50, and a second, inner,
   portion 92 having a second diameter corresponding to a width of the oblong slot 42, the
30 second diameter being greater than the first diameter.
                                                     11

           The locking member 80 also includes at the second, lower, end 94 on the
   "straight" side of the member 80 a generally rectangular protruding tab 96 that engages,
   in the manner described below, a generally rectangular detent 98 protruding from the
   first longitudinal side 44 of the slidable member 16 to releasably lock the slidable
 5 member in either of the aforementioned positions corresponding to the engaging and
   disengaged positions of the latch tongues 14.
           The locking member 80 is biased in a direction toward the longitudinal axis of the
   slidable member 16 by an open torsion spring 100. As a result, the protruding tab 96 of
   the locking member 80 is biased to engage the first longitudinal side 44 of the slidable
10 member 16 and the detent 98. The torsion spring 100 has a central curved section 102
   and a pair of diverging arms 104 extending therefrom. The central curved section 102 is
   located about the circular pin 86, and one of the pair of diverging arms 104 is attached
   within another circular aperture 106 located on the mounting plate 50 generally adjacent
   to the circular aperture 88, and the other one of the pair of diverging arms 104 is
15 attached within another circular aperture 108 located on the locking member 80 below
   the circular aperture 84. The circular apertures 88, 106 of the mounting plate 50 are
   aligned along a transverse axis, and the circular apertures 84, 108 of the locking
   member 80 are aligned along a longitudinal axis. When the protruding tab 96 engages
   the detent 98, the slidable member 16 is prevented from sliding along the mounting
?0 plate 50 (as will be described below).
           The latch mechanism 10 also includes a second generally circular pin 110
   received through the lower one of the second, inner, pair of generally oblong slots 42 of
   the slidable member 16 and a lower circular aperture 112 located on the mounting plate
   50. The circular aperture 112 is disposed above a lower one of the cylindrical bosses 52
25 and aligned with aperture 88 along a longitudinal axis. Together, the pins 86 and 110
   secure the slidable member 16, locking member 80, and latch tongues 14 to the
   mounting plate 50 so as to define a latch module 120 of the latch mechanism 10.
   Advantageously, the latch module 120 is mountable to a generally rectangular base
   plate 130 of the latch mechanism 110 (Figure 4) in a first orientation (Figures 2A and
30 2B) or a second orientation (Figures 3A and 3B), the second orientation being offset
   1800 (or flipped) about a transverse axis of the slidable member 16 from the first
   orientation. As such, a user of the latch mechanism 10 has a choice as to which push
                                                  12

   button 22, 24 having respective green and red indicators 26, 28 is located at an upper
   end 13 of the housing 12 and a lower end 15 of the housing 12 (Figure 1). For example,
   if the user desires the red "latched" indicator 28 to be displayed at the upper end 13 of
   the housing 12, then the user would mount the latch module 120 to the base plate 130
 5 in the first orientation (Figures 2A and 2B) such that the second push button 24 extends
   out of the upper end 13 of the housing 12 in extended position corresponding to the first
   (or engaging) position of the latch tongues 14. On the other hand, if the user desires the
   red "latched" indicator 28 to be displayed at the lower end 15 of the housing 12, then the
   user would mount the latch module 120 to the base plate 130 in the second orientation
10 (Figures 3A and 3B) such that the second push button 28 extends out of the lower end
   15 of the housing in the extended position corresponding to the first (or engaging)
   position of the latch tongues 14 (also see Figure 1B).
           Referring back now to Figure 4, it can be seen that the generally rectangular
   base plate 130 includes a pair of protruding generally U-shaped surfaces 132 disposed
15 slightly inwardly of respective upper and lower longitudinal ends 134, 136 of the base
   plate 130. The U-shaped surfaces 132 include opposite protruding arms 140 located
   adjacent respective opposite longitudinal sides 142, 144 of the base plate 130. The
   protruding arms 140 define a space therebetween through which a portion of the
   slidable member 16 near the T-shaped outer ends 18, 20 is slidable.
?0         The base plate 130 also includes a central circular aperture 150 located at the
   longitudinal and transverse centre of the base plate 130. The central aperture 150 is
   dimensioned to receive a cam member 160 that is adapted to drive the slidable member
   16 between the engaging and disengaged positions of the latch tongues 14. Referring
   to Figure 7A, the cam member 160 includes a lower cylindrical portion 162 dimensioned
25 to be received through the central aperture 150 of the base plate 130, a double-pinned
   upper portion 164 appearing generally "figure 8" when viewed top-down, and a cross
   like central portion 166 disposed between the lower portion 162 and the upper portion
   164. The cross-like central portion 166 is rotatably seated on the base plate 130 about
   the central aperture 150. The double-pinned upper portion 164 includes a first, central,
30 cylindrical pin 168 disposed along a central vertical axis, and a second, outer, cylindrical
   pin 170 integral with the first pin 168. The second, outer, pin 170 includes a transverse
   slot 180 configured to interface with the L-shaped locking member 80 in the manner
                                                   13

   shown in Figure 7B (and described later) to move the locking member 80 against its
   bias (provided by torsion spring 100) and to thereby disengage the protruding tab 96 of
   the locking member 80 from the detent 98 of the slidable member 16 to allow the
   slidable member 16 to slide with respect to the mounting plate 50 (as is discussed in
 5 greater detail below).
           The lower cylindrical portion 162 of the cam member 160 includes a generally
   rectangular axial slot (not shown) configured to receive a generally rectangular tailbar
   190 extending from a key-operated lock cylinder 192 (Figure 5). As is known to those
   skilled in the art, rotation of a key (not shown) of the key-operated lock cylinder 192
10 causes likewise rotation of the tailbar 190 and therefore likewise rotation of the cam
   member 160 to which the tailbar is connected. The cam member 160 also interfaces
   with the slidable member 16 in the manner described below. Accordingly, rotation of the
   cam member 160 causes the slidable member 16 to slide with respect to the mounting
   plate 50, and therefore, the slidable member 16 is reconfigurable externally, i.e, from an
15 external side of the slidable panel.
           When the latch module 120 is mounted to the base plate 130, an upper portion
   194 of the second, outer, pin 170 of the cam member 160 is received through a central
   circular aperture 146 of the mounting plate 50 and is located in a central aperture 200
   (Figure 4) of the slidable member 16. The upper portion 194 is located above the
?0 transverse slot 180. The central aperture 200 of the slidable member 16 includes a first
   generally curved side 202 disposed adjacent to the second longitudinal side 46 of the
   slidable member 16, and a second generally straight side 204 having a central semi
   circular recess 206 disposed adjacent to the first longitudinal side 44 of the slidable
   member 16. In the manner illustrated in Figure 6 below, the upper portion 194 of the
25 cam member 160 may sit within the semi-circular recess 206 and drivingly engage the
   slidable member 16 to move the slidable member 16. Advantageously, the upper
   portion 194 of the cam member 160 has a similar outer dimension to the semi-circular
   recess 206.
           As is described above, the slidable member 16 is reconfigurable to move the
30 latch tongues 14 between the engaging and disengaged positions by being operated
   internally, i.e. from the internal side of the slidable panel by pushing/pressing the push
                                                      14

   buttons 22, 24, or by being operated externally, i.e., from an external side of the slidable
   panel by operating the key-operated lock cylinder 192 to rotate the cam member 160.
          The latch mechanism 10 includes an internal key-operated lock cylinder (not
   shown), similar to the external key-operated lock cylinder 192. The internal key
 5 operated lock cylinder is selectively configurable by a key to reconfigure the locking
   member 80 in either a first, locked, configuration or a second, unlocked, configuration.
   In the first, locked, configuration, the protruding tab 96 of the locking member 80 is
   maintained in an engaging position with the detent 98 of the slidable member 16 such
   that the slidable member 16 is prevented from sliding relative to the mounting plate 50.
10 In the second, unlocked, configuration, the locking member 80 is held against its bias
   such that the protruding tab 96 is disengaged from the detent 98 thereby allowing the
   slidable member 16 to slide relative to the mounting plate 50 by pushing/pressing the
   push buttons 22, 24.
           Referring back to Figure 4, the latch mechanism 10 also includes a locking plate
15 230 configured to interface with a cam member of the internal key operated lock
   cylinder (not shown). The locking plate 230 includes a generally rectangular base
   portion 232 having a pair of outwardly projecting "wings" 234 located at a first end, and
   a pair of laterally projecting tabs 236 located a second, opposite, end. A generally
   rounded-rectangular cut-out 238 is centrally located between the pair of wings 234 and
?0 defines, along an inner edge, a camming surface 237 configured to interface with a cam
   member (not shown) of the internal key-operated lock cylinder (not shown). As is typical
   in the art, the internal key-operated lock cylinder drivingly rotates the cam member upon
   rotation of the key. As the cam member is rotated, it engages the camming surface 237
   of the locking plate 230 to slidingly move the locking plate 230, relative to mounting
25 plate 50, adjacent the second longitudinal side 46 of the slidable member 16. This
   motion is illustrated in Figures 8A and 8B.
           In Figure 8A, the locking plate 230 is in a position corresponding to the first,
   locked, configuration of the locking member 80. In this position, the protruding tab 96 of
   the locking member 80 engages the first longitudinal side 44 of the slidable member 16
30 and the detent 98, thereby preventing the slidable member 16 from sliding relative to the
   mounting plate 50. Upon operation of the internal key-operated lock cylinder, the locking
                                                    15

   plate 230 is caused to slide relative to the mounting plate 50, due to rotation of the cam
   member, to the position illustrated in Figure 8B. In this position, the base portion 232 of
   the locking plate 230 engages the end 94 of the locking member 80 and moves the
   locking member 80 against its bias such that the protruding tab 96 is maintained in a
 5 position disengaged from the detent 98, thereby allowing the slidable member 16 to
   move relative to the mounting plate 50 by pushing/pressing the push buttons 22, 24.
   The position of the locking plate 230 in Figure 8B corresponds to the second, unlocked,
   configuration of the locking member 80. Thus, when the internal lock cylinder is in the
   second, unlocked, configuration, the slidable member 16 is movable relative to the
10 mounting plate 50 through the use of the push buttons 22, 24 at the will of the user.
          External operation of the latch mechanism 10, via the external key-operated lock
   cylinder 192, will now be described with reference to Figures 6A to 6H. Referring initially
   to Figures 6A, the latch tongues 14 are shown in the engaging position and the push
   button 24 with the red indicator portion 28 is shown in the extended position (projecting
15 from the housing 12, not shown). The push button 22 with the green indicator portion 26
   is shown in the retracted position (fully received in the housing 12, not shown).
   Additionally, the protruding tab 96 of the locking member 80 is shown engaging a first
   side of the detent 98 of the slidable member 16. Accordingly, the slidable member 16 is
   releasably locked in the position corresponding to the engaging position of the latch
?0 tongues 14.
          As a user operates the key-operated lock cylinder 192 with a key, the cam
   member 160 is caused to rotate in a clockwise direction (Figure 6B) until the transverse
   slot 180 of the cam member 160 engages an inner side of the L-shaped locking
   member 80 and moves the locking member 80 against its bias to disengage the tab 96
25 from the detent 98 (Figure 6C). In this position, the slidable member 16 is unlocked and
   slidable with respect to the mounting plate 50. As the user continues to rotate the key,
   the upper portion 194 of the cam member 160 becomes located in the semi-circular
   recess 206 of the slidable member 16 (Figure 6D) and begins to drivingly engage the
   slidable member 16 to move the slidable member. As the slidable member 16 moves
30 with respect to the mounting plate 50 (i.e. to the right as shown in Figure 6E), the latch
   tongues 14 are caused to rotate from their engaging position to their disengaged
   position due to the rectangular tabs 70 of the slidable member 16 being located in the L
                                                   16

   shaped ends 68 of the slot 64 of each latch tongue 14. Continued clockwise rotation of
   the key causes likewise rotation of the cam member 160 (Figures 6F and 6G) until the
   latch tongues 14 are in their disengaged position (Figure 6H) and the push button 22
   with the green indicator portion 26 is shown in the extended position (projecting from the
 5 housing 12, not shown). In this position also, the push button 24 with the red indicator
   portion 28 is in the retracted position (fully received in the housing 12, not shown).
   Additionally, as progressively seen in Figures 6E to 6H, as the cam member 160 rotates
   out of the semi-circular recess 206 of the slidable member, the locking member 80
   returns to its locking position due to the bias of spring 100 until the tab 96 is fully
10 engaged with a second, opposite, side of the detent 98 (Figure 6H).
           The latch mechanism 10 may be mounted to the slidable panel via a pair of
   mounting screws 210 (Figures 4 and 5) received through central apertures 212 of the
   cylindrical bosses 52 and apertures 214 of the base plate 130.
           Figures 9A and 9B illustrate a generally D-shaped handle housing 12' (when
15 viewed from a rear-side) including a latch mechanism 10' according to a second
   embodiment of the invention. In the second embodiment, like numerals represent like
   parts. Parts which have been modified or adapted for the second embodiment are
   indicated by prime symbol (').
           Similar to the first embodiment, the D-shaped handle housing 12' may be
?0 mounted upon one of a slidable panel or a fixed member (not shown) for releasably
   latching the slidable panel and fixed member. In Figure 9B, the latch tongues 14 are
   shown in the first, engaging, position for engaging the other of the slidable panel or fixed
   member. In Figure 9A, the latch tongues 14 are shown in the second, disengaged
   position.
25         The latch mechanism 10' is similar to the latch mechanism 10 of the first
   embodiment (Figures 1 to 8), except that the locking plate 230' (Figure 10) forms part of
   the handle housing 12'. Figure 10 illustrates a sectional view of the D-shaped handle
   housing 12' with the latch mechanism 10' removed for clarity. Received through a
   central aperture of the handle housing 12' is an internal key-operated lock cylinder 242
30 (the "internal" key-operated lock cylinder 242 being selectively reconfigurable from an
   internal side of the slidable panel by a key). As is typical in the art, the lock cylinder 242
                                                   17

   drivingly rotates an elongate cam member 244 upon rotation of the key. This motion is
   illustrated in Figures 11A and 11B. As the cam member 244 is rotated in an anti
   clockwise direction, it engages a camming surface 237' of a generally rounded
   rectangular cut-out 238' of the locking plate 230' (Figure 11A). Continued anti-clockwise
 5 rotation of the cam member 244 causes the locking plate 230' to slide in a longitudinal
   direction along the handle housing 12' (Figure 11B) such that the locking plate 230'
   engages the locking member 80 of the latch mechanism 10' (not shown). Similar to the
   first embodiment of the invention, when the locking plate 230' engages the locking
   member 80, the locking member 80 is moved against its bias such that its protruding tab
10 96 is maintained in a position disengaged from the detent 98 of the slidable member 16,
   thereby allowing the slidable member 16 to move relative to the mounting plate 50 by
   pushing/pressing the push buttons 22, 24.
           The position of the locking plate 230' in Figure 11 B corresponds to the second,
   unlocked, configuration of the locking member 80, whereas the position of the locking
15 plate 230' in Figure 11A corresponds to the first, locked, configuration of the locking
   member 80. The direction of sliding of the locking plate 230 and 230' depends upon the
   orientation of the latch module 120 on the base plate 130.
           The latch module 10' of the second embodiment of the invention may also be
   operated externally (i.e., from an external side of the slidable panel) by an external key
?0 operated lock cylinder (not shown) similar to the lock cylinder 192 of the first
   embodiment of the invention.
           The latch mechanisms 10 and 10' of the present invention offer certain
   advantages as compared to prior latch mechanisms. Firstly, the latch mechanisms 10
   and 10' are relatively easy to use as only one projectable push button 22 or 24 is shown
25 to a user depending upon the latching state of the latch mechanism (the other
   projectable push button being fully received in the housing). Additionally, the latch
   mechanisms 10 and 10' provide a user choice of the particular indicator portion 26 or 28
   displayed at the upper or lower ends 13, 15 of the housing 12 and 12' as the latch
   module 120 of the latch mechanisms 10 and 10' may be oriented in two different
30 orientations as described above.
                                                   18

         It will be understood that the invention disclosed and defined in this specification
  extends to all alternative combinations of two or more of the individual features
  mentioned or evident from the text or drawings. All of these different combinations
  constitute various alternative aspects of the invention.

   portion projects from a second end or side of the housing when in the extended
   position.
          9.      The latch mechanism of claim 8, wherein, in the second orientation of the
20 slidable member, the first projectable portion projects from the housing at the second
   end or side of the housing when in the extended position, and wherein the second
   projectable portion projects from the first end or side of the housing when in the
   extended position.
           10.    The latch mechanism of any one of claims 6 to 9, wherein, when the
25 position of the slidable member corresponds to the engaged position of the at least one
   latching member, one of the first and second projectable portions is configured to
   project from the housing and indicate a latching state.

           11.    The latch mechanism of claim 10, wherein the latching state is indicated
   by a red coloured indicator portion on said one projectable portion being visible to the
   user.
           12.    The latch mechanism of claim 10 or 11, wherein, when the position of the
 5 slidable member corresponds to the disengaged position of the at least one latching
   member, the other of the first and second projectable portions is configured to project
   from the housing and indicate an unlatched state.
           13.    The latch mechanism of claim 12, wherein the unlatched state is indicated
   by a green coloured indicator portion on said other projectable portion being visible to
10 the user.
           14.    The latch mechanism of any one of claims 1 to 13, wherein the
   reconfigurable operable mechanism is selectively operable from a first, internal, side of
   the slidable panel by user manipulation of the projectable portions.
           15.    The latch mechanism of any one of claims 1 to 14, wherein the
15 reconfigurable operable mechanism is selectively operable from a second, external,
   side of the slidable panel by a key-operated lock.
           16.    The latch mechanism of claim 14 or 15, further including a deadlock
   configured to preclude operation of the projectable portions from the first, internal, side
   of the slidable panel unless the deadlock is deactivated.
20         17.    The latch mechanism of any one of claims 1 to 16, wherein the at least
   one latching member comprises two latch tongues, and wherein the two latch tongues
   rotate in synchronism in opposite rotational directions about respective rotational axes.
