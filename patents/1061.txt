of performing it known to me:

                                                1
A PRODUCE DELIVERY TRACKING SYSTEM
TECHNICAL FIELD
[0001]      The present invention relates to a produce delivery tracking system.
BACKGROUND
[0002]      The reference to any prior art in this specification is not, and should not be
taken as an acknowledgement or any form of suggestion that the prior art forms part of
the common general knowledge.
[0003]      Fresh produce such as fruit and vegetables is delivered from produce
wholesalers to customers (e.g. restaurants) using refrigerated trucks.
[0004]      In practice, a customer will typically telephone the wholesaler and place their
order. Invariably, the customer will telephone the wholesaler to request the status of
delivery, particularly when the order is needed immediately such as during busy
periods. In turn, the wholesaler will typically call the truck driver to obtain an off-the-cuff
delivery estimate, before needing to return a call to the customer to provide the
estimated delivery time.
[0005]      The applicant has perceived a need for improved notification of the estimated
delivery time.
[0006]      In practice, fulfilment of the order in its entirety is subject to the availability of
the fresh produce. For example, some order items are seasonal whereas others are in
short supply. In practice, some order items are either substituted with other like items or
short supplied.
[0007]      The applicant has perceived a need for improved reporting of the order items
in advance of delivery.
[0008]      Often, orders are placed on a recurring basis all well in advance of the
delivery date. The customer often has no recollection of what was actually ordered.

                                                 2
[0009]      The applicant has perceived a need for a more transparent ordering system.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
[00010]     According to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a produce
delivery tracking system including:
        a produce delivery schedule including produce orders to be delivered and
associated delivery locations;
        a locator for locating a vehicle delivering the orders;
        a map tool for determining roads along which the vehicle can travel; and
        a notification tool for notifying an estimated delivery time for an order in the
schedule using the associated delivery location, location of the vehicle, and information
relating to the roads along which the vehicle can travel.
[00011]     Advantageously, the notification tool may provide an up-to-date estimated
delivery time which may be more accurate than off the cuff advice provided by the
vehicle driver.
[00012]     The system may further include an itemisation tool for itemising one or more
of the orders to be delivered. Advantageously, the itemisation tool enables the customer
to obtain details of the actual order items provided in advance of delivery.
[00013]     The itemisation tool may further be configured to itemise future orders to be
delivered and enable variance of those orders. Advantageously, the itemisation tool
further provides transparency and enables the customer to obtain itemisation of past,
present or future orders.
[00014]      Preferably, the schedule is arranged in delivery order. The locator may
include a GPS location fitted to the vehicle, or a GPS of a phone carried by the vehicle.
[00015]       The notification tool may include a display for displaying the map. The
display may display the location of the vehicle on the map and one or more of the
delivery locations.

                                               3
[00016]     The estimated delivery time may be determined by using the track traffic time
along the roads between the delivery location and location of the vehicle. The estimated
delivery time may also include additional delivery time for any intervening orders.
[00017]     The system may further include an ordering system for placing produce
orders to be included in the delivery schedule.
[00018]     According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a
produce delivery tracking method including:
       compiling a produce delivery schedule including produce orders to be delivered
and associated delivery locations;
       locating a vehicle delivering the orders;
       determining roads along which the vehicle can travel; and
       notifying an estimated delivery time for an order in the schedule using the
associated delivery location, location of the vehicle, and information relating to the roads
along which the vehicle can travel.
[00019]     Any of the features described herein can be combined in any combination
with any one or more of the other features described herein within the scope of the
invention.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
[00023]     According to an embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a
fresh produce delivery tracking system 100 as shown in figure 1. The system 100
includes a database 102 storing a produce delivery schedule 104 including produce
orders to be delivered and associated delivery locations (e.g. addresses). An example
delivery schedule 102, with the orders in chronological delivery order, is as follows:
Order      Customer ID            Order                   Location
no.
1           Fong's Chinese        Cabbages (x2)           66 Wickham Tce
            restaurant                                    Fortitude Valley, QLD
2           Luigi's Italian       Tomatoes (x6)           90 Brunswick St
            restaurant            Garlic (x8)             New Farm, QLD
[00024]     The system 100 includes a GPS locator 106 for locating a vehicle 108
delivering the orders. The locator 106 includes a GPS fitted to the vehicle 108, or a GPS
of a phone carried by a driver of the vehicle 108. A map tool 110 (e.g. Google maps)
includes roads 112 along which the vehicle 108 can travel and traffic congestion or drive
time data relating to the roads 112 so that the travel time can be ascertained.
[00025]     A notification tool on a customer's computer 114 is provided for notifying the
customer 1116 of an estimated delivery time 118 for an order in the schedule using the
associated delivery location 120, location of the vehicle 122, roads 112 along which the
vehicle 108 can travel and traffic data.
[00026]     Advantageously, the notification tool 114 provides an up-to-date estimated
delivery time 118 which is more accurate than off-the-cuff estimates provided by the
vehicle driver. The notification tool 114 includes a display for displaying a map 110, the
location of the vehicle 122 on the map 110 as well as one or more of the delivery
locations 120, 130.
[00027]     The system 100 further includes a wholesaler warehouse 124 where the
produce is stored and from which the vehicle 108 is dispatched. A wholesaler Web
server 126 administers the database 102 and the operation of the overall system 100.
The vehicle 108, customer's notification tool 114 and wholesaler web server 126 can all

                                              5
communicate with each other via a network 128 including the Internet and a telephone
network.
[00028]     A produce delivery tracking method 200 performed using the system 100 is
now described with reference to figure 2.
[00029]     At step 202, the wholesaler server 126 receives an order from the customer
116. The customer 116 may phone in the order which is then manually entered into the
database 102 by server 126. Alternatively or additionally, the system 100 further
includes an automated ordering system which enables the customer 116 to place the
order, using computer 114, that is automatically stored in database 102 by the
wholesaler server 126.
[00030]     At step 204, the wholesaler server 126 using the database 102 compiles the
produce delivery schedule 104, including produce orders to be delivered and associated
delivery locations. The schedule 104 is produced in chronological delivery order based
upon the delivery locations using the map tool 110.
[00031]     At step 206, the wholesaler server 126 locates the vehicle 108 delivering the
orders using the GPS locator 106. The vehicle 108 is delivering the orders in
accordance with the schedule 104 provided to the driver.
[00032]     At step 208, the wholesaler server 126 determines the roads 112 along which
the vehicle 108 will travel when delivering the orders and traffic data relating to the
roads 112 using the map tool 110.
[00033]     At step 210, the wholesaler server 126 notifies the customer computer 114 of
an estimated delivery time 118 for the associated order in the schedule 104. The
delivery time 118 is automatically determined using the associated delivery location
120, location of the vehicle 108 using GPS locator 106, traffic drive time along roads
112 between the delivery location 120 and the vehicle location, traffic data (e.g.
factoring in current delays owing to accidents), and any additional delivery time for
orders at any intervening locations 130 (e.g. 5 minutes to unload the order from the
vehicle 104).

                                               6
[00034]     At step 212, an itemisation tool of the server 126 itemises the customer's
order at the request of the customer 116 using computer 114. Advantageously, the
itemisation tool enables the customer 116 to obtain details of the actual order items
provided in advance of delivery to see what is and isn't coming and assist with meal
preparation.
[00035]     At step 214, the itemisation tool further itemises future orders to be delivered
on another day and enables variance of those orders by the customer 116 using the
computer 114. Advantageously, the itemisation tool further provides transparency and
enables the customer 116 to obtain itemisation of past, present or future orders using
computer 114.
[00036]     A person skilled in the art will appreciate that many embodiments and
variations can be made without departing from the ambit of the present invention.
[00037]     In compliance with the statute, the invention has been described in language
more or less specific to structural or methodical features. It is to be understood that the
invention is not limited to specific features shown or described since the means herein
described comprises preferred forms of putting the invention into effect.
[00038]     Reference throughout this specification to 'one embodiment' or 'an
