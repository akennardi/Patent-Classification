    Aqueous adjuvant-compositions
    The invention relates to aqueous adjuvant compositions comprising
    alkylglucam ides, to their use for producing aqueous pesticide compositions,
  5 and to aqueous pesticide compositions comprising alkylglucamides.
     Pesticides (primarily fungicides, herbicides, and insecticides) are chemical
    substances produced synthetically or of natural origin that penetrate plant
    cells, plant tissue, or parasitic organisms in or on the plant, causing their
10  damage and/or destruction. The largest share of the pesticides is that of
    herbicides. Pesticides are used customarily in the form of liquid or solid
    concentrated preparations (formulations) in agriculture. These preparations
    make handling easier for the user or ensure greater activity on the part of
    the active ingredient. The formulations are customarily diluted with water
15  before use and then delivered by spray application.
    Water-soluble concentrates (Soluble Liquids, abbreviated SL) are one
    particularly important form of pesticide preparations. They play a large part
    particularly for herbicides, with the pesticides often being used as water
20  soluble salts which are converted into their alkali metal salts or ammonium
    salts by neutralization of the acid form of the herbicides with suitable bases.
    A particularly important part is played by the water-soluble salts of
    herbicides, such as, for example, of glyphosate, of glufosinate, or of the
25  auxin herbicides such as 2,4-D or dicamba. They are used preferably as
    the alkali metal salt or in the form of various ammonium salts, or as a
    mixture of these salts, usually as aqueous formulations.
    A general problem with the use of pesticides is that only a fraction of the
30  active ingredient develops the desired activity. The greater part is often lost
    without being utilized, with the active ingredient failing to reach the leaves
    or roots of the plant when the spray mixture is delivered, and instead
    seeping unutilized into the soil, being washed off by rain, or simply not
    being properly taken up by the plant.
35
    This environmental and economic disadvantage can be reduced by
    addition of auxiliaries, identified in the context of the present patent
    application as "adjuvants", to pesticide formulations. These auxiliaries may,

   WO 2014/067663                                            PCT/EP2013/003290
                                          2
   for example, reduce spray drift, improve wetting of the plant, or ensure that
   the active ingredient adheres to the plant surface for a longer time and/or is
   taken up more effectively. Particularly in the case of water-soluble
   pesticides, such as in the case of glyphosate, for example, the nature and
 5 also the amount of the adjuvants used have a critical influence on the
   activity of the formulation.
   By far the       most commonly     used adjuvants in aqueous herbicide
   formulations are fatty amine ethoxylates, principally tallow fatty amine
10 ethoxylates. On account of their toxic and ecotoxicological properties,
   however, such as the severe eye irritation or the toxicity toward aquatic
   organisms, these products are classed as objectionable and are
   increasingly being replaced by adjuvants having a better toxicological and
   ecotoxicological profile.
15
   Adjuvants which are employed in aqueous pesticide formulations are
   customarily in liquid form, i.e., as water-miscible solutions, in order to
   simplify production of the pesticide formulation. The adjuvant solutions may
   comprise water and/or water-miscible solvents which together with the
20 pesticide produce a homogeneous and storage-stable aqueous
   formulation. Water is used as solvent if possible, being preferred for
   reasons not only of cost but also of the environment. Cosolvents may be
   used, capable of improving the solubility or the stability.
25 The use of sugar-based surfactants, such as alkyl-N-methylglucosamides,
   in cleaning products and cosmetic products, for example, is described in
   the literature (F.W. Lichtenthaler, "Carbohydrates as Organic Raw
   Materials" in Ullmann's Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry,
   Wiley-VCH Verlag, 2010).
30
   WO 96/16540 describes pesticide compositions which long-chain
   alkylamides that carry on the amide nitrogen a polyhydroxycarbonyl
   substituent having at least three hydroxyl groups. Described in the
   examples are emulsifiable concentrates, water-dispersible powders, and
35 granules        of     dodecyl-N-methylglucamide,         dodecyltetradecyl-N
   methylglucamide, and cetylstearyl-N-methylglucamide.

   WO 2014/067663                                          PCTIEP20131003290
                                          3
   The requirements relating to adjuvants in aqueous pesticide compositions
   have grown continually over the years. Besides high biological activity and
   unobjectionability, from the standpoint both of the user and of the
   environment, increasingly more advantageous performance properties are
 5 being required. The adjuvants are to permit very high loading of the
   formulation with the active ingredient, and are to be compatible as far as
   possible with different active ingredients. The formulations must be
   storage-stable and must have a very low viscosity, in order to ensure
   greater ease of handling, and also must facilitate complete or near
10 complete emptying of the containers. Further requirements are for effective
   miscibility and rapid dissolution capacity, including and particularly in cold
   water, when the spray mixture is being prepared.
   The object, accordingly, was that of providing new aqueous adjuvant
15 compositions which are highly active, which are distinguished by a very
   advantageous toxicological and environmental profile, and which have
   properties advantageous from a performance standpoint.
   The object is surprisingly achieved         by new adjuvant compositions
20 comprising
   a)     one or more alkylglucamides of the formula (1)
                                 H   OH     R2

25
   in which
   RI     is a linear or branched alkyl group having 5 to 9 carbon atoms,
30 R2     is an alkyl group having I to 3 carbon atoms,
   b)     water
   c)     optionally a cosolvent.

   WO 2014/067663                                         PCTIEP2013/003290
                                         4
   In the one or more alkylglucamides of the formula (1), the radical RI is
   preferably a linear or branched alkyl group having 7 to 9 carbon atoms. The
   radical R2 is preferably a methyl group.
 5
   More preferably the adjuvant compositions of the invention comprise a
   mixture of octyl-N-methylglucamide (R1 = Cy alkyl, R2 = methyl) and decyl
   N-methylglucamide (R1 = C9 alkyl, R2 = methyl). The fraction of octyl-N
   methylglucamide in this mixture is 10 to 90 wt%, preferably 20 to 80 wt%,
10 and more preferably 30 to 70 wt%, based on the total amount of
   alkylglucamides present in said mixture. The fraction of decyl-N
   methylglucamide in this mixture is 10 to 90 wt%, preferably 20 to 80 wt%,
   and more preferably 30 to 70 wt%, based on the total amount of
   alkylglucamides present in this mixture.
15
   The pentahydroxyhexyl radical in the alkylglucamides of the formula (1)
   possesses different chiral centers, meaning that in each case there are a
   plurality of possible stereoisomers. The alkylglucamides of the formula (1)
   are customarily prepared from naturally occurring sugars, such as
20 D-glucose, although in principle it is possible to use other natural or
   synthetic hexoses or other C6 building blocks as well, and so different
   stereoisomers of the formula (1)may result.
   The cosolvent c) included optionally may either be present as a secondary
25 component from the alkylglucamide preparation procedure, or may have
   been added subsequently to the adjuvant composition. The cosolvent may
   comprise a single solvent or a mixture of two or more solvents. Suitable for
   this purpose are all polar solvents which are compatible with the aqueous
   pesticide composition and which form a homogeneous phase. Examples of
30 suitable cosolvents are monohydric alcohols, such as methanol, ethanol,
   propanols, butanols, benzyl alcohol, or polyhydric alcohols such as
   ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, propylene glycol, or glycerol, or
   polyglycols such as polyethylene, polypropylene, or mixed polyalkylene
   glycols (PAGs). Other suitable solvents are ethers such as, for example,
35 propylene glycol monomethyl or dimethyl ether, dipropylene glycol
   monomethyl or dimethyl ether, amides such as N-methyl- or
   N-ethylpyrrolidone,        for       example,        N,N-dimethyllactamide,

   WO 2014/067663                                          PCT/EP2013/003290
                                            5
   N,N-dimethylcaprylamide, or N,N-dimethyldecanamide.
   Particularly suitable cosolvents are mono or polyhydric alcohols, and
   especially suitable are dihydric or trihydric alcohols such as propylene
 5 glycol, glycerol, or polyethylene, polypropylene and/or mixed polyalkylene
   glycols (PAGs).
   The fraction of the cosolvent in the composition is customarily 10 to 250 g/l,
   preferably 20 to 200 g/l, and more preferably 30 to 150 g/l.
10
   The cosolvent may additionally contribute toward stabilizing the adjuvant
   compositions, by, for example, raising the low-temperature stability or heat
   stability, or positively influencing other performance properties such as the
   viscosity.
15
   The alkylglucamides of the formula (i) are based preferably on renewable
   raw materials and are notable for an advantageous toxicological and
   environmental profile. They possess high solubility in water.
20 The aqueous adjuvant compositions comprise preferably 10 to 90 wt%,
   more preferably 20 to 80 wt%, and especially preferably 30 to 70 wt% of
   the one or more alkylglucamides of component a).
   The aqueous adjuvant compositions of the alkylglucamides of the formula
25 (I) are suitable as adjuvants in aqueous pesticide compositions for
   improving the biological activity of herbicides, insecticides, fungicides,
   acaricides, bactericides, molluscids, nematicides, and rodenticides.
   Another subject of the invention is therefore the use of the aqueous
30 adjuvant compositions for boosting the biological activity of pesticides,
   particularly of herbicides.
   The aqueous adjuvant compositions are outstandingly suitable for
   producing storage-stable aqueous pesticide compositions which possess
35 advantageous properties.
   Another subject of the invention is therefore the use of the compositions of

    WO 20141067663                                          PCT/EP2013/003290
                                           6
    alkylglucamides for producing aqueous pesticide compositions. Customary
    methods for producing such pesticide compositions are known to the skilled
    person.
 5  Also a further subject of the invention, moreover, are aqueous pesticide
    compositions comprising
    a)     one or more alkylglucamides of the formula (1)
                                   H   OH    R2

    in which
    R1     is a linear or branched alkyl group having 5 to 9 carbon atoms,
15
    R2     is an alkyl group having 1 to 3 carbon atoms,
    b)     water
20  c)     optionally a cosolvent,
   d)      one or more water-soluble pesticides.
   Water-soluble pesticides for the purposes of the invention are to be
25  understood as meaning pesticides which at room temperature (25 0 C) have
   a solubility of more 50 g/il and preferably more than 100 g/I in water.
    Preferred water-soluble pesticides are the water-soluble herbicides, among
   which preference is given in turn to the water-soluble salts of acifluorfen,
30 aminopyralid, amitrole, asulam, benazolin, bentazone, bialaphos,
   bispyribac, bromacil, bromoxynil, bicyclopyron, chloramben, clopyralid, 2,4
   D, 2,4-DB, dicamba, dichlorprop, difenzoquat, diquat, endothal,
   fenoxaprop, flamprop, flumiclorac, fluoroglycofen, fomesafen, fosamine,
   glufosinate, glyphosate, imizameth, imazamethabenz, imazomox, imazapic,

   WO 2014/067663                                          PCT/EP2013/003290
                                           7
   imazapyr, imazaquin, imazethapyr, MCPA, MCPB, mecoprop, octanoic
   acid, paraquat, pelargonic acid, picloram, quizalofop, 2,3,6-TBA, and
   triclopyr. The precise chemical composition and structure of all of these
   compounds are known and can be looked up on the Internet at:
 5 http://www.alanwood.net/pesticides/index_cn_frame.html
   Particularly preferred are the water-soluble salts of 2,4-D, bentazone,
   dicamba, fomesafen, glyphosate, glufosinate, MCPA, and paraquat.
   Exceptionally preferred are the water-soluble salts of glyphosate.
10
   Preference among the water-soluble salts is given in particular to the alkali
   metal salts and ammonium salts, and of these in turn to the potassium,
   ammonium,          dimethylammonium,           isopropylammonium,          and
   (2-hydroxyethyl)trimethylammonium salts.
15
   The water-soluble pesticides of component d) may also comprise a
   combination of two or more pesticides. Such combinations are important
   especially when the aim, for example, is to broaden the activity spectrum of
   the pesticide composition or more effectively to prevent resistances toward
20 particular pesticides.
   Combining two or more water-soluble pesticides in one formulation,
   however, is a difficult enterprise. This is because the active ingredients are
   customarily not compatible with one another, and the aqueous mixtures are
25 therefore not phase-stable. Very surprisingly, however, the alkylglucamides
   of the formula (1) are suitable for stabilizing such fundamentally
   incompatible compositions, a fact which was hitherto unknown.
   In a further embodiment of the invention, therefore, the pesticide
30 compositions of the invention comprise at least two water-soluble
   pesticides of component d).
   With preference the at least two water-soluble pesticides are selected from
   glyphosate, glufosinate, 2,4-D, dicamba, and fomesafen.
35
   Particularly preferred compositions are those where the water-soluble
   pesticides of component d) comprise the combinations of the two

   WO 2014/067663                                           PCT/EP2013/003290
                                          8
   herbicides glyphosate and 2,4-D, glyphosate and dicamba, glyphosate and
   fomesafen, glyfosate and glufosinate, 2,4-D and dicamba, glufosinate and
   2,4-D, and glufosinate and dicamba.
 5 The preparation of the alkylglucamides of the formula (I) has been well
   described before and is known to the skilled person. It is accomplished, for
   example, by condensing carboxylic esters with a secondary
   N-alkylglucamine, which in its turn may be prepared by reductive amination
   from a sugar such as D-glucose.
10
   The alkylglucamides of the formula (1) described above can be used to
   produce pesticide compositions of the invention, especially aqueous
   herbicide formulations, having excellent performance properties.
15 In the formulation of aqueous pesticide compositions, a concern is to load
   the composition with as high a concentration of active ingredient as
   possible. Doing so reduces costs of packaging, transport, storage, and
   disposal. An adjuvant composition ought therefore to be capable of
   permitting stable, highly loaded pesticide compositions, known as "high
20 load" formulations. This is accomplished surprisingly well with the
   alkylglucamides of the formula (1).
   In one preferred embodiment of the invention, the amount of the one or
   more water-soluble pesticides of component d) in the compositions of the
25 invention is more than 100 g/l, preferably more than 200 g/l, and more
   preferably more than 300 g/l. These quantity figures are based on the total
   weight of the pesticide composition of the invention, and on the amount of
   free acid, or "acid equivalent" (a.e.) in the case of pesticides used in the
   form of their water-soluble salts (such as, customarily, glyphosate or 2,4-D,
30 for example).
   In a further preferred embodiment of the invention, the amount of the one
   or more alkylglucamides of the formula (I) in the pesticide compositions of
   the invention is 20 to 250 g/l, preferably 40 to 200 g/l, and more preferably
35 50 to 150 g/l. These quantity figures are based on the total amount of the
   pesticide composition of the invention.

   WO 2014/067663                                          PCT/EP20131003290
                                           9
   The alkylglucamides of the formula (1)are used customarily in the form of
   solutions. For clarification here it is noted that the quantity figures stated
   above are based in this case on the active content of the alkylgiucamides
   of the formula (1)in the solution.
 5
   A particularly important criterion for the storage stability of aqueous
   pesticide compositions such as glyphosate formulations and 2,4-D
   formulations, for example is the phase stability. A composition is held to be
   sufficiently phase-stable when it remains homogeneous over a wide
10 temperature range and when there is no formation of two or more separate
   phases or of precipitates (formation of a further solid phase). Phase
   stability - both at elevated temperature, as may occur, for example, in the
   case of storage in the sun or in hot countries, and at low temperature, such
   as in winter or in cold climatic regions, for example - is the critical
15 prerequisite for a storage-stable formulation.
   The pesticide compositions of the invention are notable in that they are
   phase-stable even at a temperature of preferably greater than 55CC, more
   preferably of greater than 70*C, and especially preferably of greater than
20 800C.
   Furthermore, the pesticide compositions of the invention are notable for the
   fact that they are phase-stable even at a temperature of preferably less
   than 10"C, more preferably of less than 0*C, and especially preferably of
25 less than -10"C.
   The pH of the pesticide compositions is situated customarily in the range
   from 3.5 to 8.0, preferably at 4.0 to 7.0, and more preferably at 4.5 to 6.5
   (measured in the form of a 1 wt% aqueous dilution). The pH is determined
30 primarily by the pH values of the solutions of the aqueous pesticides,
   present in the form of salts of weak acids. By addition of acids or bases, the
   pH can be adjusted to a different value differing from the original pH of the
   mixture.
35 The high salt stability of the pesticide composition of the invention in an
   aqueous medium, even in the case of a high pesticide concentration and
   salt concentration, constitutes a great performance advantage. It also

   WO 2014/067663                                          PCT/EP2013/003290
                                         10
   makes it possible for agrochemical salts such as fertilizers, for example, to
   be included in the composition.
   In another preferred embodiment of the invention, therefore, the pesticide
 5 compositions comprise        one or more agrochemical       salts, preferably
   ammonium salts.
   With particular preference the pesticide compositions comprise ammonium
   sulfate, ammonium nitrate, ammonium phosphate, ammonium thiocyanate
10 and/or ammonium chloride.
   The pesticide compositions of the invention may comprise one or more
   auxiliaries further to the one or more alkylglucamides of the formula (1), and
   in that case these further auxiliaries may be, for example, preservatives,
15 surfactants, defoamers, functional polymers, or additional adjuvants.
   Preservatives which can be used include organic acids and their esters, as
   for example ascorbic acid, ascorbyl palmitate, sorbate, benzoic acid,
   methyl and propyl 4-hydroxybenzoate, propionates, phenol, as for example
20 2-phenylphenate, 1,2-benzisothiazolin-3-one, formaldehyde, sulfurous acid,
   and salts thereof.
   The surfactants may generally be all nonionic, amphoteric, cationic, or
   anionic surfactants that are compatible with the composition.
25
   Examples of nonionic surfactants are ethoxylates and alkoxylates of
   relatively long-chain aliphastic or aromatic alcohols, fatty amine
   ethoxylates, relatively long-chain ether amine alkoxylates, (optionally
   ethoxylated) sorbitan esters, and alkylpolyglycosides. Suitable amphoteric
30 surfactants include long-chain alkyldimethylbetaines or alkyldimethylamine
   oxides, or alkyldimethylamineamidopropylamine oxides. Suitable among
   the anionic surfactants, for example, are ether sulfates of ethoxylated fatty
   alcohols, reaction products of (optionally ethoxylated) long-chain alcohols
   with phosphoric acid derivatives. Suitability under "long-chain" is possessed
35 by linear or branched hydrocarbon chains having at least 6 and not more
   than 22 carbon atoms.

                                           11
   Suitable     defoamers     are    fatty    acid    alkyl  ester   alkoxylates,
   organopolysiloxanes such as polydimethylsiloxanes and mixtures thereof
   with microfine, optionally silanized silica; perfluoroalkylphosphonates
   and -phosphinates, paraffins, waxes, and microcrystalline waxes, and
 5 mixtures thereof with silanized silica. Also advantageous are mixtures of
   different foam inhibitors, examples being those composed of silicone fluid,
   liquid paraffin and/or waxes.
   The functional polymers which may be present in the pesticide composition
10 of the invention are high molecular mass compounds of synthetic or natural
   origin with a molar mass of greater than 10 000. The functional polymers
   may for example act as antidrift agents or may boost rain resistance.
   In a further preferred embodiment of the invention, the pesticide
15 compositions of the invention comprise one or more adjuvants further to the
   one or more alkylglucamides of component a), such adjuvants being those
   as may conventionally be used in aqueous pesticide compositions.
   These are, preferably, fatty amine ethoxylates, ether amine ethoxylates,
20 alkylbetaines or amidoalkylbetaines, amine oxides or amidoalkylamine
   oxides, alkylpolyglycosides, or copolymers of glycerol, coconut fatty acid,
   and phthalic acid.
   These adjuvants are known from the literature as adjuvants in aqueous
25 pesticide compositions and are described in W02009/029561, for example.
   In a further preferred embodiment of the invention, the pesticide
   compositions of the invention take the form of concentrated formulations
   which are diluted prior to use, in particular with water (examples being
30 "ready-to-use", "in-can", or "built-in" formulations), and they comprise the
   one or more water-soluble pesticides of component d) in amounts of 5 to
   80 wt%, preferably of 10 to 70 wt%, and more preferably of 20 to 60 wt%,
   and the one or more alkylglucamides of the formula (1) in amounts of 1 to
   25 wt%, preferably of 2 to 20 wt%, and more preferably of 3 to 15 wt%.
35 These quantity figures are based on the overall concentrated formulation,
   and on the amount of free acid, the "acid equivalent" (a.e.), in the case of
   pesticides which are used in the form of their water-soluble salts.

    The pesticide compositions of the invention are applied to the fields
    preferably in the form of spray mixtures. These spray mixtures are
    produced by diluting concentrated formulations with a defined quantity of
 5 water.
    In a further preferred embodiment of the invention, the compositions of the
    invention are in the form of spray mixtures and comprise 0.001 to 10 wt%,
    preferably 0.02 to 3 wt%, and more preferably 0.025 to 2 wt% of the one or
10  more water-soluble pesticides of component d) and 0.001 to 3 wt%,
    preferably 0.005 to 1 wt%, and more preferably 0.01 to 0.5 wt% of the one
   or more alkylglucamides of the formula (I). The stated quantity figures are
    based on the overall spray mixture, and on the amount of free acid, the
   "acid equivalent" (a.e.), in the case of pesticides which are used in the form
15 of their water-soluble salts.
   The invention further relates to the use of the pesticide compositions of the
   invention for the checking and/or for the control of weeds, fungal diseases,
   or insect infestation. Preference is given to the use of the compositions of
20 the invention for controlling and/or for checking weeds.
   These uses may preferably also take place by what is called a tank-mix
   method. In this scenario, then, the one or more water-soluble pesticides of
   component d) and the one or more alkylglucamides of the formula (1), and
25 also the water, may also take the form of what is called a "tank-mix"
   preparation. In such a preparation, both the one or more water-soluble
   pesticides and the one or more alkylglucamides of the formula (1) - the
   latter optionally together with further adjuvants - are present separately
   from one another. Prior to application, generally a short time before, the
30 two preparations are mixed with one another, producing a pesticide
   composition of the invention.

 5 The alkylglucamide was prepared from a commercially available C8/C10
   carboxylic acid methyl ester (C8 fraction 55 wt%, C10 fraction 45 wt%) by
   reaction with N-methylglucamine in propylene glycol as described in

   alkylglucamide of the formula (1) R1 = C8 H 17 and C1 0 H21, R2 = CH3, also
10 contained 10 wt% of propylene glycol from the reaction mixture. 60 g of this
   mixture were dissolved in 40 g of water. This gave a stable aqueous

   Since it was not possible to produce stable and manageable solutions of
   the C12/14 glucamide, a 20 wt% strength solution in propylene glycol was
10 prepared for the biological tests and the formulation experiments. With the
   C16/18 glucamide, preparing a propylene glycol solution in the same
   concentration was not possible.
   Example 4:      Biological activity of the adjuvant compositions
15
   For the purpose of determining the biological activity, greenhouse trials
   were carried out with glyphosate on Echinochloa crus-galli (L.) Beauv.
   (ECHCG), Cirsium arvense L. (CIRAR), and Solanum nigrum L. (SOLNI).
   The plants were cultivated in a greenhouse under 14 hours of irradiation
20 with light at a temperature of 19/14 (± 0.5)*C (day/night) and a relative
   humidity of 70/80 (t 5)% (day/night). The light was supplied via high
   pressure sodium lamps, high-pressure mercury lamps, and fluorescent
   tubes, producing a power of 70 W/m 2 at the leaf level. The plants were

   WO 2014/067663                                           PCT/EP2013/003290
                                            15
   grown in 12 cm diameter plastic pots filled with a mixture of sand and
   humus in a sand:humus ratio of 1:2 by volume.
   The pots were placed on an under-soil watering mat, which was wetted
 5 daily with a medium-strength nutrient solution. Following their appearance
   at the substrate surface, seedlings were thinned out to five (ECHCG), two
   (CIRAR), or one (SOLNI) plant per pot for the activity tests.
   The spray solutions were applied using a laboratory sprayer operated with
10 compressed air and fitted with a Teejet TP8003E nozzle at an application
   rate of 200 I/ha to the plants at 303 kPa. ECHCG was treated at the two- to
   three-leaf stage; CIRAR and SOLNI were treated at the four-leaf stage.
   For the more differentiated examination of the adjuvant effect, the
15 glyphosate active ingredient was underdosed, meaning that the plants are
   not completely killed. This was done using aqueous solutions of
   glyphosate-isopropylammonium salt (glyphosate IPA). The amount of
   glyphosate used was 33.8 g a.e./ha glyphosate IPA (corresponding to
   1.0 mmol or 0.17 g a.e./I for a liquid volume of 200 I/ha) in the case of
20 ECHCG, and at 20.3 g a.e./ha glyphosate IPA (corresponding to 0.6 mmol
   or 0.10 g a.e./l at a liquid volume of 200 I/ha) for CIRAR and SOLNI.
   The amount of adjuvant in each of the spray solutions was 0.25 wt%. The
   differences in the active contents of the products employed were taken into
25 account. The amounts used were corrected - that is, the figure of 0.25 wt%
   referred in all cases to 100% active content of the adjuvants - and are
   therefore comparable with one another.

10 The result of the experiments            shows that the      inventive adjuvant
   composition based on the C8 /C1o-alkyl-N-methylglucamide (see Al) is
   much more effective than that based on the longer-chain, non-inventive
   C12/C 4-alkyl-N-methylglucamide (see A2). At the same time a comparable
   (or higher) activity is achieved than with the commercial products Genamin
15 267 (see A3) or Synergen GL 5 (see A4).

   compositions 11 and 12 contain 360 and 480 g/Il glyphosate a.e. (a.e.: acid
   equivalent).
 5 For comparison, two non-inventive pesticide compositions were produced
   with the C12/C 14-alkyl-N-methylglucamide (A2) and also Genamin 267 (A3)
   and Synergen GL 5 (A4). The cloud point and the viscosity of the
   compositions were determined.
10 The cloud point was determined by heating the composition, which was
   heated until clouding occurred. Thereafter the composition was cooled with
   stirring and continual temperature monitoring. The temperature at which the
   clouded solution turns clear again was recorded as the cloud point value.

    The experiments make it clear that the inventive adjuvant composition

    formulations, which are distinguished by more advantageous applications
    properties, specifically by higher cloud point and hence at the same time a

   active content of 440 g/I a.e. (acid equivalent) based on 2,4-D. The phase
   stability of the formulation was determined by ascertaining the cloud point
 5 and also the low-temperature stability at 0*C and -10*C. The formulation
   showed a cloud point of > 95"C and was homogeneous and phase-stable
   after storage for a duration of 24 hours both at 00C and at -10"C.
