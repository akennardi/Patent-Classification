   Summary of Invention
   Technical Problem
20 [0004]    Meanwhile, paper sheet feeding units of a pressure contact type are known.          In
   the pressure contact type, a plurality of gate rollers are in contact with a plurality of
   opposing feed rollers with a predetermined pressure.
   [0005]    In the conventional pressure contact type, the plurality of gate rollers are provided
   to a single shaft, and rotate around the single shaft.      Accordingly, the plurality of gate
25 rollers are brought into pressure contact with the plurality of opposing feed rollers with an
                                                   1

   equal force.
   [0006]    Disadvantageously, when a paper sheet whose coefficient of friction against the
   feed roller varies depending on the portion, such as a banknote whose thickness partially
   varies and a banknote having uniform thickness whose coefficient of friction partially
 5 varies, passes between the plurality of gate rollers and the plurality of feed rollers which
   are brought into pressure contact with each other with such an equal force, skewing of the
   paper sheet results.
   [0007]    When, for example, a thick portion of a paper sheet passes between a feed roller
   and a gate roller, and a thin portion of the paper sheet passes between another feed roller
10 and another gate roller, the force exerted from the gate roller on the thick portion of the
   paper sheet is greater than the thin portion since the conventional gate rollers are provided
   around a single shaft and are in pressure contact with the feed rollers (or, are biased in a
   direction of the feed rollers) with an equal force as described above.       The coefficient of
   frictional is increased at the thick portion, on which the larger force is exerted, than the thin
15 portion in the paper sheet, and thus the advancement speed of the thick portion is reduced
   in comparison with the thin portion.      This results in skewing of the paper sheet.
   [0008]    In view of this, an object of the present invention is to provide a paper sheet
   feeding unit that suppresses skewing of paper sheets.
   Solution to Problem
20 [0009]    A paper sheet feeding unit of an embodiment of the present invention includes: a
   plurality of feed rollers; a plurality of gate rollers respectively disposed opposite to the
   plurality of feed rollers; a biasing member that independently biases the plurality of gate
   rollers toward the plurality of feed rollers; and a supporting member that supports the
   plurality of gate rollers and the biasing member.
25 Advantageous Effects of Invention
   [0010]    According to the present invention, skewing of paper sheets can be suppressed.

   sheet feeding unit according to the first embodiment of the present invention is applied.
   As illustrated in FIG. 1, the paper sheet processing device 1 includes a placing part 2,
   storing parts 3a to 3d, storing parts 4a and 4b, a display part 5, and an operation part 6.
 5 The following description will be made with the axis orthogonal coordinate system of x, y,
   and z illustrated in FIG. 1 with respect to the paper sheet processing device 1.
   [0014]    Paper sheets are placed on the placing part 2.       The paper sheets placed on the
   placing part 2 are taken in into the apparatus one by one in response to a predetermined
   operation of the user on the operation part 6, for example.
10 [0015]    The paper sheet which has been taken in into the apparatus is stored in any one of
   storing parts 3a, 3b, 3c, 3d, 4a, and 4d.    Examples of the paper sheet include a banknote, a
   ballot paper and the like.    In the following description, the paper sheet is a banknote.
   [0016]     The storing parts 3a to 3d respectively store banknotes of predetermined
   denominations.       The denominations of the banknotes which have been taken in into the
15 apparatus are determined by an identification part described later, and the banknotes are
   stored (sorted) into the storing parts 3a to 3d in accordance with the denominations, for
   example.
   [0017]    The storing parts 4a and 4b house rejected banknotes which are not housed in the
   storing parts 3a to 3d.     Examples of the rejected banknotes include counterfeit notes and
20 unfit notes.    It is determined whether the banknote taken in into apparatus is a rejected
   banknote by the identification part described later.
   [0018]    The display part 5 is a liquid crystal display, and displays a count result of
   banknotes and the like, for example.      The operation part 6 is a key apparatus, and receives
   a predetermined operation from the user, for example.        For example, the operation part 6
25 receives, from the user, a request for sorting banknotes, and a request for starting count.
   [0019]    FIG. 2 is a schematic sectional view taken along the xz-plane of the paper sheet

   to the conveyance part 12 one by one.       The conveyance part 12 conveys the banknote fed
   from the paper sheet feeding unit 11 to any one of the storing parts 3a, 3b, 3c, 3d, 4a, and
   4d.
   [0021]    An identification part 13 is provided in a region around the conveyance part 12 on
10 the downstream side of the paper sheet feeding unit 11 (in the direction in which the
   banknote is conveyed) and on the upstream side of the storing parts 3a, 3b, 3c, 3d, 4a, and
   4d.    The identification part 13 includes a magnetic sensor, a line sensor, an ultraviolet
   sensor and the like (not illustrated), and identifies the denomination, discrimination,
   authentication, fitness and the like of the banknote based on the sensor value, for example.
15 [0022]    A control part 14 controls the branches 15a to 15e in accordance with the
   identification result of the identification part 13.   The branches 15a to 15e separate the
   banknotes conveyed by the conveyance part 12 in accordance with the control of the
   control part 14 into the storing parts 3a, 3b, 3c, 3d, 4a, and 4d.     For example, the control
   part 14 controls the branches 15a to 15e such that the banknotes of predetermined
20 denominations identified by the identification part 13 are stored in the storing parts 3a to
   3d in accordance with identification result.
   [0023]    FIG. 3 illustrates details of the paper sheet feeding unit 11 of FIG. 2.    In FIG. 3,
   the components same as those of FIG. 2 are denoted with the same reference numerals.

                                                   5

   [0024]    The auxiliary conveyance roller 21a rotates counterclockwise in the drawing.
   The auxiliary conveyance roller 21a assists kicking of banknotes of the kicker roller 22a,
   and is referred to also as an auxiliary kicker roller.
   [0025]     The kicker roller 22a is provided on the downstream side of the auxiliary
 5 conveyance roller 21a.      The kicker roller 22a rotates counterclockwise in the drawing.
   The kicker roller 22a kicks, toward the downstream side, the lowermost banknotes of a
   plurality of banknotes placed on the placing part 2.
   [0026]    The feed roller 23a is provided on the downstream side of the kicker roller 22a.
   The feed roller 23a rotates counterclockwise in the drawing, and sends, to the conveyance
10 part 12, the lowermost banknotes kicked by the kicker roller 22a.
   [0027]    The gate roller part 24 is provided on the downstream side of the kicker roller 22a.
   As specifically described later, the gate roller part 24 includes an arm shaft 31, a support

15 roller 35a can rotate.
   [0028]    The gate roller 35a is provided such that the outer peripheral surface thereof
   makes contact with the outer peripheral surface of the feed roller 23a.    The gate roller 35a
   includes a one-way clutch (not illustrated), and is rotatable only in the counterclockwise
   direction in the drawing, for example.      With this configuration, the banknote that passes
20 between the feed roller 23a and the gate roller 35a is sent to the conveyance part 12 one by
   one.
   [0029]    The support arm 32a can rotate around the arm shaft 31.     With this configuration,
   the center of the gate roller 35a supported by the support arm 32a can move along the
   circumference of a circle around the arm shaft 31 as two-headed arrow Al indicates in FIG.
25 3.
   [0030]    The conveyance roller 25a and the counter roller 25b are provided to face each
                                                   6

   other on the downstream side of the feed roller 23a and the gate roller part 24.              The
   conveyance roller 26a and the counter roller 26b are provided to face each other on the
   downstream side of the conveyance roller 25a and the counter roller 25b.                      The
   conveyance rollers 25a and 26a rotate counterclockwise in the drawing, and sends, to the
 5 conveyance part 12, the banknote sent from the feed roller 23a.
   [0031]    FIG. 4 illustrates a positional relationship of the rollers of the paper sheet feeding
   unit 11 of FIG. 3 as viewed in +z-axis direction.      In FIG. 4, the components same as those
   of FIG. 3 are denoted with the same reference numerals.            As illustrated in FIG. 4, the
   paper sheet feeding unit 11 includes two auxiliary conveyance rollers 21a and 21b, three
10 kicker rollers 22a to 22c, four feed rollers 23a to 23d, and four gate rollers 35a to 35d.
   The banknote placed on the placing part 2 is sent out in +x-axis direction illustrated in FIG.
   4.
   [0032]    The auxiliary conveyance rollers 21a and 21b are disposed parallel to each other
   along the y-axis direction.      The kicker rollers 22a to 22c are disposed parallel to each
15 other along the y-axis direction on the downstream side of the auxiliary conveyance rollers
   21a and 21b (in the +x-axis direction).     The feed rollers 23a to 23d are disposed parallel to
   each other along the y-axis direction on the downstream side of the kicker rollers 22a to
   22c (in the +x-axis direction).      The gate rollers 35a to 35d are disposed parallel to each
   other along the y-axis direction on the downstream side of the kicker rollers 22a to 22c (in
20 the +x-axis direction).     The gate rollers 35a to 35d are disposed opposite to the feed
   rollers 23a to 23d, respectively.
   [0033]    FIG. 5 is a perspective view of the gate roller part 24 of FIG. 3.       In FIG. 5, the
   components same as those of FIG. 3 are denoted with the same reference numerals.                A
   part of the gate roller part 24 is described with FIG. 5, and the entirety of the gate roller part
25 24 is described with FIG. 7.
   [0034]    As illustrated in FIG. 5, the gate roller part 24 includes the arm shaft 31,the
                                                    7

   support arm 32a, a guide plate 33a, a gate roller shaft 34a, the gate roller 35a, a shaft
   attaching member 36a, a biasing member 37a, and an adjusting part 40.
   [0035]    The arm shaft 31 is a rod-shaped member.         The arm shaft 31 is provided on the
   downstream side of the feed roller 23a and the gate roller 35a.       The rod-shaped arm shaft
 5 31 is provided such that the longitudinal direction thereof is parallel to the y axis.
   [0036]    One end of the support arm 32a is rotatably and pivotally supported by the
   rod-shaped arm shaft 31.          The support arm 32a extends slightly upward (+z-axis
   direction) from the arm shaft 31, and extends to the upstream side (-x-axis direction) (see
   FIG. 6).
10 [0037]    The guide plate 33a is a plate-shaped member.         The guide plate 33a is fixed to
   the support arm 32a in a region around the arm shaft 31, and extends to the upstream side
   (-x-axis direction) in parallel with the support arm 32a.
   [0038]    One end of the gate roller shaft 34a extending along the y-axis direction is fixed at
   an end portion of the guide plate 33a on the upstream side (-x-axis direction side).         The
15 gate roller shaft 34a extends through the gate roller 35a and the support arm 32a, and the
   other end thereof is fixed to a shaft attaching member 36a (see FIG. 6 and FIG. 7).
   [0039]    The gate roller 35a is sandwiched between the support arm 32a and the guide
   plate 33a, and is rotatably attached to the gate roller shaft 34a.
   [0040]    The shaft attaching member 36a has a discoid shape, and fixes the other end of the
20 gate roller shaft 34a, for example.
   [0041]    FIG. 6 illustrates the support arm 32a of the gate roller part 24 of FIG. 5 as viewed
   in the +y-axis direction.     In FIG. 6, the components same as those of FIG. 5 are denoted
   with the same reference numerals.        In FIG. 6, the shape of the gate roller part 24 and the
   like are schematically illustrated.    As illustrated in FIG. 6, the other end of the gate roller
25 shaft 34a is fixed to the shaft attaching member 36a.
   [0042]    As described with FIG. 5, one end of the gate roller shaft 34a is fixed to the guide
                                                    8

   plate 33a.    As illustrated in FIG. 6, the other end of the gate roller shaft 34a is fixed to the
   shaft attaching member 36a.       The gate roller shaft 34a whose both ends are fixed to the
   guide plate 33a and the shaft attaching member 36a extends through the gate roller 35a and
   the support arm 32a pivotally supported by the arm shaft 31.
 5 [0043]     With this configuration, the gate roller 35a can move along the circumference of a
   circle around the arm shaft 31 as two-headed arrow All indicates in FIG. 6.           In addition,
   the gate roller 35a can rotate around the gate roller shaft 34a in the direction indicated with
   arrow A12 in FIG. 6 with the one-way clutch described with FIG. 3, for example.
   [0044]     Now the description is returned to of FIG. 5.     One end of a biasing member 37a
10 is fixed to the support arm 32a, and the other end thereof is in contact with a cam 43a of the
   adjusting part 40 described later (see FIG. 6).     The biasing member 37a has a coil spring,
   and biases the gate roller 35a coupled with the support arm 32a in a direction of the feed
   roller 23a.
   [0045]     The adjusting part 40 includes an adjusting shaft 41, an adjusting knob 42, and the
15 cam 43a.      The adjusting shaft 41 is a rod-shaped member.          The rod-shaped adjusting
   shaft 41 is provided above the biasing member 37a.         The rod-shaped adjusting shaft 41 is
   provided such that the longitudinal direction thereof is in parallel with the y axis.
   [0046]     The adjusting knob 42 is provided at one end of the adjusting shaft 41.            The
   adjusting shaft 41 rotates along with the rotation of the adjusting knob 42.
20 [0047]     The adjusting shaft 41 is provided with the cam 43a.             The cam 43a is an
   elliptical plate member, for example.      When the adjusting knob 42 is rotated, the adjusting
   shaft 41 is rotated, and, along with the rotation of the adjusting shaft 41, the cam 43a is
   rotated.
   [0048]     The other end of the biasing member 37a is in contact with the cam 43a.             As
25 described above, the cam 43a has an elliptical shape, for example.              Accordingly, the
   biasing force of the biasing member 37a can be changed by rotating the adjusting knob 42.
                                                    9

   In addition, one end of the biasing member 37a is fixed to support the arm 32a, and the
   gate roller 35a is supported (pivotally supported) by the support arm 32a.         Accordingly,
   the biasing force of the gate roller 35a with respect to the feed roller 23a can be changed by
   rotating the adjusting knob 42.
 5 [0049]    For example, when the adjusting knob 42 is rotated such that the distance between
   the other end of the biasing member 37a and the adjusting shaft 41 is increased (for
   example, when the adjusting knob 42 is rotated such that the portion of the cam 43a
   indicated with arrow A13a in FIG. 6 makes contact with the other end of the biasing
   member 37a), the coil spring of the biasing member 37a is compressed.           In this manner,
10 the biasing force of the gate roller 35a with respect to the feed roller 23a is increased.    On
   the other hand, when the adjusting knob 42 is rotated such that the distance between the
   other end of the biasing member 37a and the adjusting shaft 41 is reduced (for example,
   when the adjusting knob 42 is rotated such that the portion of the cam 43a indicated with
   arrow A13b in FIG. 6 makes contact with the other end of the biasing member 37a), the coil
15 spring of the biasing member 37a is stretched.        In this manner, the biasing force of the
   gate roller 35a with respect to the feed roller 23a is reduced.
   [0050]    FIG. 7 illustrates the gate roller part 24 of FIG. 5 as viewed in the -x-axis
   direction.   In FIG. 7, the components same as those of FIG. 4 and FIG. 5 are denoted with
   the same reference numerals.      It is to be noted that, in FIG. 7, the shape of the gate roller
20 part 24 and the like are schematically illustrated.
   [0051]    As illustrated in FIG. 7, the gate roller part 24 includes the arm shaft 31, the
   support arms 32a to 32d, the guide plates 33a to 33d, the gate roller shafts 34a to 34d, the
   gate rollers 35a to 35d, the shaft attaching members 36a to 36d, the biasing members 37a to
   37d, and the cams 43a to 43d.
25 [0052]     The configuration of the support arms 32b to 32d is similar to that of the support
   arm 32a described with FIG. 5.        Each of the support arms 32b to 32d is rotatably and
                                                   10

   pivotally supported by the arm shaft 31 as with the support arm 32a.       Each of the support
   arms 32a to 32d is pivotally supported by the arm shaft 31 in a separate and independent
   manner, and is thus separately and independently rotatable.
   [0053]    The configuration of the guide plates 33b to 33d is similar to that of the guide
 5 plate 33a described with FIG. 5.    The guide plates 33b to 33d are respectively fixed to the
   support arms 32b to 32d as with the guide plate 33a.
   [0054]    The configuration of the gate roller shafts 34b to 34d is similar to that of the gate
   roller shaft 34a described with FIG. 5.     Each of the gate roller shafts 34a to 34d is an
   individual and independent shaft.    The gate roller shaft 34b extends through the gate roller
10 35b and the support arm 32b, and the both ends thereof are fixed to the guide plate 33b and
   the shaft attaching member 36b.     The gate roller shaft 34c extends through the gate roller
   35c and the support arm 32c, and the both ends thereof are fixed to the guide plate 33c and
   the shaft attaching member 36c.     The gate roller shaft 34d extends through the gate roller
   35d and the support arm 32d, and the both ends thereof are fixed to the guide plate 33d and
15 the shaft attaching member 36d.
   [0055]    Each of the support arms 32a to 32d is an individual and independent member as
   described above.    In addition, each of the gate roller shafts 34a to 34d is an individual and
   independent member as described above.         Accordingly, the gate rollers 35a to 35d are
   capable of separately and independently moving along the circumference of a circle around
20 the arm shaft 31, and separately and independently rotate around the gate roller shafts 34a
   to 34d, respectively.
   [0056]    The configuration of the biasing members 37b to 37d is similar to that of the
   biasing member 37a described with FIG. 5.       One ends of the biasing members 37b to 37d
   are fixed to the respective support arms 32b to 32d, and the other ends thereof are in
25 contact with the respective cams 43b to 43d.
   [0057]    The configuration of the cams 43b to 43d is similar to that of the cam 43a
                                                 11

   described with FIG. 5.      The cams 43b to 43d are fixed to the adjusting shaft 41, and rotate
   along with the rotation of the adjusting shaft 41.
   [0058]     FIG. 8 illustrates a state where a banknote whose thickness varies depending on
   the portion passes through the gate roller part 24.      In FIG. 8, the components same as
 5 those of FIG. 7 are denoted with the same reference numerals.             FIG. 8 illustrates a
   banknote P11 passing between the feed rollers 23a to 23d and the gate rollers 35a to 35d.
   [0059]     The thickness of the banknote P11 is greater at the portion that passes between the
   feed roller 23b and the gate roller 35b than at other portions.    In this case, the gate roller
   35b moves upward with respect to the gate rollers 35a, 35c and 35d as arrow A21 indicates
10 in FIG. 8.
   [0060]     In this manner, the gate rollers 35a to 35d can individually and independently
   move along the circumference of a circle around the arm shaft 31 (see, for example,
   two-headed arrow All in FIG. 6).         With this configuration, even in the case where a
   banknote whose thickness varies depending on the portion passes therethrough, the gate
15 roller part 24 can compensate the thickness variation of the banknote with the gate rollers
   35a to 35d and can suppress skewing.         In addition, also in the case where a banknote
   whose coefficient of friction varies depending on the portion passes therethrough, the gate
   roller part 24 can compensate the variation in coefficient of friction with the gate rollers
   35a to 35d (for example, the frictional force can be reduced since any of the gate rollers
20 35a to 35d where a portion of a banknote which has a large coefficient of friction passes
   can move upward), and skewing can be suppressed.
   [0061]     FIG. 9 is a perspective view of a part of the adjusting part 40.      In FIG. 9, the
   components same as those of FIG. 7 are denoted with the same reference numerals.          In the
   following description, the spring constants of the coil springs of the biasing members 37a
25 to 37d are equal to each other.
   [0062]     The cams 43a to 43d illustrated in FIG. 9 have the same shape, and are fixed to the
                                                  12

   adjusting shaft 41 such that the longitudinal axes thereof are oriented in the same direction.
   In the example illustrated in FIG. 9, the longitudinal axes of the cams 43a to 43d are
   oriented in the +x-axis direction.
   [0063]    When the adjusting shaft 41 having the above-mentioned the cams 43a to 43d are
 5 rotated, the biasing forces of the biasing members 37a to 37d are changed such that the
   values of the biasing forces are equal to each other.
   [0064]    FIG. 10 is another perspective view of a part of the adjusting part 40.  In FIG. 10,
   the components same as those of FIG. 7 are denoted with the same reference numerals.        In
   the following description, the spring constants of the coil springs of the biasing members
10 37a to 37d are equal to each other.
   [0065]    While the cams 43a to 43d illustrated in FIG. 10 have the same shape, the
   longitudinal axes thereof are fixed to the adjusting shaft 41 such that the longitudinal axes
   are oriented in different directions.  In the example illustrated in FIG. 10, the longitudinal
   axes of the cams 43a and 43c are oriented in the +x-axis direction, while the longitudinal
15 axes of the cams 43b and 43d are oriented in the +z-axis direction.
   [0066]    When the adjusting shaft 41 having the above-mentioned the cams 43a to 43d is
   rotated, the biasing forces of the biasing members 37a and 37c that make contact with the
   cams 43a and 43c are changed such that the biasing forces have the same values, and the
   biasing forces of the biasing members 37b and 37d that make contact with the cams 43b
20 and 43d are changed such that the biasing forces have the same values.       Then, the biasing
   forces of the biasing members 37a and 37c that make contact with the cams 43a and 43c,
   and the biasing force of the biasing members 37b and 37d that make contact with the cams
   43b and 43d are different from each other.
   [0067]    It is to be noted that, the shapes of the cams 43a to 43d may be different from
25 each other. With this configuration, the adjusting part 40 can change the biasing forces of
   the biasing members 37a to 37d such that the biasing forces have different values.
                                                 13

   [0068]    In addition, coil springs of different spring constants may be applied to the biasing
   members 37a to 37d.      With this configuration, even in the case where the cams 43a to 43d
   having the same shape are fixed to the adjusting shaft 41 so as to be oriented in the same
   direction as illustrated in FIG. 9, the adjusting part 40 can change the biasing forces of the
 5 biasing members 37a to 37d such that the biasing forces have different values.
   [0069]    In addition, the cams 43a to 43d may be respectively fixed to individual and
   independent adjusting shafts.     Then, an adjusting knob may be provided to the individual
   and independent adjusting shaft.        With this configuration, the adjusting part 40 can
   individually adjust the values of the biasing forces of the biasing members 37a to 37d.
10 [0070]    In addition, it is possible to adopt a configuration in which, by setting the
   denomination of the banknote to be fed from the placing part 2 in the operation part 6, the
   adjusting shaft 41 is automatically turned, and the values of the biasing forces of the
   biasing members 37a to 37d are adjusted.
   [0071]    As described above, paper sheet feeding unit 11 includes a plurality of feed rollers
15 23a to 23d, and a plurality of gate rollers 35a to 35d disposed opposite to respective feed
   rollers 23a to 23d in a one-to-one relationship.       In addition, paper sheet feeding unit 11
   includes biasing members 37a to 37d that bias gate rollers 35a to 35d individually in a
   direction of feed rollers 23a to 23d, and support arms 32a to 32d that support gate rollers
   35a to 35d and biasing members 37a to 37d.
20 [0072]    With this configuration, even in the case where a banknote whose thickness varies
   depending on the portion passes through the paper sheet feeding unit 11, the gate rollers
   35a to 35d move to compensate the thickness variation of the banknote, by being biased
   independently respectively, and thus skewing is suppressed.         In addition, even in the case
   where a banknote having a uniform thickness whose coefficient of friction varies
25 depending on the portion passes through paper sheet feeding unit 11, the gate rollers 35a to
   35d move to compensate the variation in coefficient of friction of the banknote, by being
                                                   14

   biased independently respectively, and thus skewing is suppressed.
   [0073]    While banknotes whose thickness and/or coefficient of friction varies such as
   hybrid banknotes in which a partially transparent polymer part is formed, and banknotes
   provided with a security thread for counterfeiting prevention are in circulation in recent
 5 years, skewing of such banknotes can also be suppressed, and removal of the security
   thread can be suppressed, for example.
   [0074]    In addition, the paper sheet feeding unit 11 includes the adjusting part 40 that
   adjusts the biasing forces of the biasing members 37a to 37d.         With this configuration, the
   paper sheet feeding unit 11 can handle banknotes of various thicknesses.

   (Second embodiment)
          The biasing member is provided for each gate roller in the first embodiment.          In the
   second embodiment, gate rollers are grouped into a plurality of groups, and the biasing
   member is provided for each group.
15 [0076]    FIG. 11 illustrates a gate roller part 51 of the paper sheet feeding unit 11 according
   to the second embodiment of the present invention.          In FIG. 11, the components same as
   those of FIG. 7 are denoted with the same reference numerals.           As illustrated in FIG. 11,
   the gate roller part 51 includes gate roller shafts 52a and 52b.
   [0077]    In the gate roller part 51 illustrated in FIG. 11, the biasing member 37a is provided
20 for the two gate rollers 35a and 35b.        In addition, in the gate roller part 51, the biasing
   member 37c is provided for the two gate rollers 35c and 35d.            That is, in the gate roller
   part 51 illustrated in FIG. 11, a plurality of gate rollers 35a to 35d are grouped into a
   plurality of groups, and the biasing members 37a and 37c are provided to respective
   groups.
25 [0078]    One end of the gate roller shaft 52a is fixed to the guide plate 33a, and the other
   end thereof is fixed to the shaft attaching member 36b.         The gate roller shaft 52a extends
                                                    15

   through the gate roller 35a, the support arm 32a, the guide plate 33b, the gate roller 35b,
   and the support arm 32b.        The gate rollers 35a and 35b have a common the gate roller
   shaft 52a, and therefore move together along the circumference of a circle around the arm
   shaft 31.   In addition, the gate rollers 35a and 35b rotate around the gate roller shaft 52a.
 5 [0079]     One end of the biasing member 37a is fixed to the support arm 32a, and the other
   end thereof is in contact with the cam 43a.       The biasing member 37a alone biases the two
   gate rollers 35a and 35b in a direction of the feed rollers 23a and 23b.        It is to be noted
   that the biasing member is not fixed to the support arm 32b.
   [0080]     One end of the gate roller shaft 52b is fixed to the guide plate 33c, and the other
10 end thereof is fixed to the shaft attaching member 36d.        The gate roller shaft 52b extends
   through the gate roller 35c, the support arm 32c, the guide plate 33d, the gate roller 35d,
   and the support arm 32d.       The gate rollers 35c and 35d have common the gate roller shaft
   52b, and therefore move together along the circumference of a circle around the arm shaft
   31.    In addition, the gate rollers 35c and 35d rotate around the gate roller shaft 52b.
15 [0081]     One end of the biasing member 37c is fixed to the support arm 32c, and the other
   end thereof is in contact with the cam 43c.       The biasing member 37c alone biases the two
   gate rollers 35c and 35d in a direction of the feed rollers 23c and 23d.        It is to be noted
   that the biasing member is not fixed to the support arm 32d.
   [0082]     As described above, the plurality of gate rollers 35a to 35d are grouped into a
20 plurality of groups, and the biasing members 37a and 37c are provided for respective
   groups.    With this configuration, the paper sheet feeding unit 11 can reduce the number of
   components such as the biasing member, and can achieve cost reduction.
   [0083]     While adjacent the gate rollers 35a and 35b are grouped, and adjacent the gate
   rollers 35c and 35d are grouped in the above-mentioned configuration, the way of grouping
25 is not limited to this.   For example, it is also possible to group the gate rollers 35a and 35d,
   and group the gate rollers 35b and 35c.         In addition, for example, it is also possible to
                                                    16

   group the gate rollers 35a and 35c, and group the gate rollers 35b and 35d.       Further, it is
   also possible to group the gate rollers 35a, 35b, and 35c, while separating the gate roller
   35d.
   [0084]    The grouping of the gate rollers 35a to 35d is determined based on the thickness
 5 of the banknote, for example.     For example, in the gate rollers 35a to 35d, the gate rollers
   where a portion of the same thickness, of a banknote, passes are grouped.      In addition, for
   example, the grouping is determined based on the coefficient of friction of the banknote.
   For example, in the gate rollers 35a to 35d, the gate rollers where a portion of the same
   coefficient of friction, of a banknote, passes are grouped.
