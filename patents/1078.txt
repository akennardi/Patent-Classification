                                            TECHNICAL FIELD
   This disclosure relates to an electrical connector for making electrical connection
 5 to insulated conductors with insulation displacement contacts.
                                            BACKGROUND ART
   Electrical connectors having insulation displacement contacts are typically used to
   make an electrical connection with insulated conductors (wires) intermediate their
   ends. Such electrical connectors require the insulation displacement contacts to
10 cut through the insulation of the conductors and make an electrical connection
   between the contacts and the conductors. This electrical connection is made by
   relative movement of the insulation displacement contacts and the conductors in a
   direction that is generally lateral to the longitudinal direction of the conductors.
   The insulated conductors may be of variable sizes (as measured across their width
15 or diameter), and as such it is desirable that the electrical connector is able to cater
   for insulated connectors of different sizes and still make an effective electrical
   connection between the contacts and the conductors.
   It is to be understood that, if any prior art is referred to herein, such reference does
   not constitute an admission that the prior art forms a part of the common general
20 knowledge in the art, in Australia or any other country.
                                               Summary
   According to a first aspect, disclosed is an electrical connector for making
   electrical connection to at least one insulated conductor comprising: a body
   having at least one channel for receiving the at least one insulated conductor, a
25 terminal; and a first set of insulation displacement contacts electrically connected
   to the terminal and being staggered laterally and spaced longitudinally in the at
   least one channel.

   9596924_1 (GHMatters) P104163.AU.1

   Advantageously, conductors of varying dimensions have been found to make an
   effective electrical connection with the conductors in the channels of the first
   aspect.
   It is understood that staggered may include in alternating or continually
 5 overlapping insulation displacement contacts, as well as non-overlapping
   insulation displacement contacts. In addition, spaced longitudinally includes
   conductors that are spaced so they are overlapping or adjacent as well as spaced
   apart or non-overlapping.
   In some embodiments, at least one guide disposed in the at least one channel to
10 facilitate making the electrical connection between the insulated conductors and
   the plurality of insulation displacement contacts. The at least one guide may be
   disposed in the channel such that the at least one channel is tortuous to define an
   indirect path for the conductors within the at least one channel. The at least one
   guide may be positioned proximal to an insulation displacement contact to bend
15 the conductor toward to contact and facilitate an effective electrical connection.
   In some forms, the channel is surrounded by a wall, and the at least one guide
   protrudes from the wall into the channel, and in some forms, the at least one guide
   protrudes from a bottom surface of the channel.
   In some embodiments, the insulation displacement contacts extend longitudinally
20 in the at least one channel. In alternative embodiments, the insulation
   displacement contacts may extend transverse (at any angle) in the at least one
   channel or lateral to the longitudinal direction of the at least one channel.
   In some forms, the body further comprising first and second first and second parts
   moveable in relation to each other from an open position where access is provided
25 to locate the at least one conductor in the at least one channel to a closed position
   where the at least one conductor is captured in the at least one channel. In some
   embodiments, the body parts pivotable relative to each other and in one form,
   movably joined via a hinge. In some forms, the electrical connector further
   comprises a retaining portion for retaining the at least one conductor in the at least
                                              2
   9596924_1 (GHMatters) P104163.AU.1

   one channel. In some forms, in moving the first and second parts to the closed
   position, an engaging arrangement forces engagement between the at least one
   conductor with the first set of insulation displacement contacts. In some forms, the
   retaining portion forms part of the engaging arrangement.
 5 In some embodiments, the connector further comprising a lock to lock the first
   and second parts in the in the closed position. The lock may comprise a retaining
   member slideable relative to the first and second parts. In some forms, one of the
   first and second parts includes the retaining member slideably mounted thereto
   and a flange, and the other of the first and second parts includes a tab, and in use
10 movement of the retaining member over the tab causes the tab to engage the
   flange to lock the first and second parts together.
   The lock of this form may be beneficial as it is easy to move between the locked
   and the unlocked position and it is fixed to one part of the body to prevent loss.
   According to a second aspect, disclosed is an electrical connector for making
15 electrical connection to insulated conductors comprising a body having at least
   one channel for receiving the insulated conductors, and insulation displacement
   contacts disposed in the at least one channel and at least one guide disposed in the
   at least one channel to facilitate making the electrical connection between the
   insulated conductors and the plurality of insulation displacement contacts.
20 According to a third aspect, disclosed is an electrical connector for making
   electrical connection to at least one insulated conductor comprising a body having
   at least one channel for receiving the at least one insulated conductor; a terminal;
   at least one insulation displacement contact disposed in the at least one channel
   and electrically connected to the terminal, wherein the body further comprising
25 first and second parts moveable in relation to each other from an open position
   where access is provided to locate the at least one conductor in the at least one
   channel to a closed position where the at least one conductor is captured in the at
   least one channel, and at least one engaging arrangement, wherein in moving the
   first and second parts to the closed position, the engaging arrangement forces
                                              3

   engagement between the at least one conductor with the at least one insulation
   displacement contact, wherein the at least one engaging arrangement is adjustable
   to accommodate different sizes of the at least one insulated conductor.
   In some embodiments, the engaging arrangement comprises at least one
 5 projection extending from an internal surface of one part of the body and is
   locatable in the at least one channel to force the at least one insulated conductor
   into engagement with the at least one insulation displacement contact, the
   engaging arrangement being adjustable to vary the distance between the at least
   one projection and the at least one insulated conductor in the closed position. The
10 length of the at least one projection may be adjustable. The length of the at least
   one projection may be adjustable at least in part through having a base portion and
   removable portion removably mountable on the base portion.
   In some forms, the at least one projection is positioned to correspond to the
   position of the at least one insulation displace contact. In some forms, the at least
15 one projection is dimensioned to fit within the at least one channel.
   The electrical connector may further comprise at least one secondary projection
   which corresponds to the cable to retain the cable in position in relation to the
   body to facilitate the at least one insulated conductor making electrical connection
   with the at least one insulation displacement contact.
20 In some forms, the at least one projection and the at least one secondary
   projection are integrally formed.

                                      DETAILED DESCRIPTION
   In the following detailed description, reference is made to accompanying
10 drawings which form a part of the detailed description. The illustrative
   embodiments described in the detailed description, depicted in the drawings and
   defined in the claims, are not intended to be limiting. Other embodiments may be
   utilised and other changes may be made without departing from the spirit or scope
   of the subject matter presented. It will be readily understood that the aspects of
15 the present disclosure, as generally described herein and illustrated in the
   drawings can be arranged, substituted, combined, separated and designed in a
   wide variety of different configurations, all of which are contemplated in this
   disclosure.
   The electrical connector of the disclosure is arranged to electrically connect to
20 insulated conductors Typically, the electrical connector is used in fixed wiring in
   residential and industrial applications to connect electrical devices (such as
   lighting and the like) to the wiring. The electrical connector uses insulation
   displacement contacts and is arranged to be installed intermediate the ends of the
   insulated conductors and to make an effective electrical connection between the
25 contacts and the conductors. The connector provides a terminal connection for
   electrical appliances which is typically in the form of a socket outlet, but may take
   the other form, such as a screw terminal or the like.
                                                6

   Typically the conductors are provided as thermoplastic-sheathed cable (TPS).
   TPS is commonly used in the building industry in fixed wiring applications. It
   includes an outer PVC sheath of insulation covering one or more insulated
   conductors (typically formed of copper). The TPS may be flat or round and the
 5 one or more insulated conductors may vary in diameter size. A feature of at least
   one form of the connector of the disclosure is that it allows rapid connection to the
   insulated conductors and is able to accommodate conductors of different sizes
                                      22
   (typically in the range of 1mm -2.5 mm in cross-sectional area). However, it is
   to be appreciated that the disclosure is not limited to this range and the features of
10 the connector of the disclosure may be modified to accommodate different ranges
   of conductor sizes.
   Referring to Figs. 1, to 3, the connector 10 generally includes a body 11 formed
   from two parts 14 and 15, which in the illustrated form are hinged together and
   are movable relative to each other between an open position (shown in Fig. 1) and
15 a closed position (shown in Fig. 2). The connector 10 is arranged to receive and
   clamp insulated conductors (in the illustrated form being three conductors 12A,
    12E, and 12N corresponding to the active, earth and neutral conductors) which
   form part of a flat TPS 13 when the parts are in the closed position. To allow the
   conductors to be clamped, the outer sheath of the TPS is stripped along a small
20 length to reveal the inner insulated conductors (12A, 12E, 12N in the illustrated
   form). For convenience, markings 23 may be provided on the body 11 to indicate
   the strip length required. The connector 10 incorporates an electrical terminal such
   as a socket outlet 17 on one part 15 of the body 11, and the connector 10 is
   arranged to establish electrical contact between the conductors 12A, 12E, 12N and
25 corresponding terminals of the socket outlet 42A, 42E, and 42N (see Fig. 5) on
   clamping of the insulated conductors.
   The connector 10 further includes a snap fit latching arrangement 16
   incorporating resilient tangs 18 incorporated on one part 14 of the body 11 that
   engage in a corresponding slot 20 formed in the other part 15 when the parts are
30 moved to the closed position. The purpose of the latching arrangement 16 is to
                                              7
   9596924_1 (GHMatters) P104163.AU.1

   retain the parts in the closed position and prevent them from being easily opened.
   In use the snap fit latching arrangement 16 is a one way latch and typically only
   able to be released using a tool such as a screwdriver which would allow the parts
    14, 15 to be moved from the closed position (in clamping engagement with the
 5 conductors) to the open position. The illustrated latching arrangement 16 includes
   two latches but any number of latches may be used. A separate lock 22 may be
   provided which is actuatable when the parts 14, 15 are in the closed position. The
   lock 22 holds the parts in tight fitting engagement in the closed position and
   provides an additional level of security to the connector 10 to maintain the body
10 parts 14, 15 closed. The operation of the lock 22 will be described in more detail
   below.
   An embodiment of the construction of the connector 10 that allows the electrical
   connection between the terminals 42A, 42E, and 42N of the socket outlet 17 and
   the conductors 12A, 12E, 12N is described below with reference to Figs 4 to 7.
15 In the illustrated form, the body 10 incorporates at least one channel for receiving
   the insulated conductors 12. As discussed above, the connector 10 is designed to
   make rapid and easy electrical connection to the at least one conductor 12 with
   only the removal of an outer sheath. The number of channels of the connector
   may correspond to the number of conductors. Alternatively, one channel may be
20 configured to receive any number of conductors. In the illustrated form, three
   channels 30, 32, 34 are provided which correspond to each of the three conductors
    12A, 12E, 12N.
   In the illustrated form, the channels are open and formed in body part 15 and
   extend across the part 15 and communicate with openings 35, 36 which allow the
25 TPS 13 to extend through the connector 10.
   To provide the electrical connection, contacting devices 40 are disposed in the
   respective channels. In the illustrated form, respective contact devices 40 are
   provided and disposed in respective channels 30, 32, and 34. These contact
   devices are conductive and typically formed from a copper alloy. As best shown
                                               8
   9596924_1 (GHMatters) P104163.AU.1

   in Fig. 5, each contact device 40 incorporates a set of insulation displacement
   contacts 41 and a contact terminal 42 for the socket outlet 17. The contact devices
   40 as illustrated are in slightly different configurations to locate within the
   respective channels of the body part 15 and to be orientated correctly for the
 5 socket outlet 17. For convenience in the description below in some instances the
   references A, E, and N are used to differentiate between the specific ones of the
   contact devices 40 and their component parts as required.
   Each set of insulation displacement contacts 41 are generally upstanding planar
   conductive portions having a sharp tip designed to pierce the insulation of the
10 conductors 12. Each set of insulation displacement contacts include a plurality of
   contacts (43, 44, 45) that are conductive and are staggered laterally and spaced
   longitudinally apart. In the illustrated embodiment, each set of contacts includes
   three insulation displacement contacts but it is to be appreciated that the set may
   include more than three or possibly two. The respective socket terminals which
15 are bifurcated are configured to extend into a socket 17 of the connector and
   therefore project in the opposite direction (see Fig. 6 which shows contact device
   40N).
   The contact devices (40A, 40E, and 40N) are disposed in the respective channels
   30, 32, 34 so that the contacts (43, 44, 45) of the sets of insulation displacement
20 contacts 41 are staggered laterally and spaced longitudinally along the respective
   channels. Electrical connection may be made between the insulated conductors
    12A, 12E and 12N and the contact device 40A, 40E, and 40N by piercing of one
   or more of the contacts 43, 44, 45 into each of conductors. The staggering and
   spacing of contacts allows the conductor to accommodate conductors of different
25 diameters.
   In the illustrated embodiment, each channel 30, 32, 34 is approximately 2.5mm
                                                                           2           2
   wide to receive any size conductor having an area of between 1mm and 2.5 mm2
   However, it is understood, that larger conductors (e.g. 6 mm 2 ) may be used, in
   which case the size of each channel, or a respective one of the channels may be
                                                9
   9596924_1 (GHMatters) P104163.AU.1

   increased to accommodate the larger size conductors. If a smaller than 1 mm 2
   conductor is used, then additional insulation displacement contacts may be
   included in the channel to facilitate electrical contact.
   As best shown in Figs. 5 and 7, the position of the insulation displacement
 5 contacts 43, 44, 45 in its respective channel is advantageous for making electrical
   contact with a conductor of different sizes. The insulation displacement contacts
   43, 44, 45 are staggered laterally in their respective channel (see Fig. 5). For
   example, if a 1 mm2 conductor is received in a 2.5mm wide channel, then at least
   one of the insulation displacement contacts will make electrical connection with
10 the 1.0 mm2 conductor despite the width of the conductor being smaller than the
   width of the channel. The insulation displacement contacts 43, 44, 45 are able to
   make electrical contact with the conductor 12 because at least one is offset from
   another across the width of the channel 30, 32, 34. Advantageously, no matter
   where the conductor 12 lies in a respective channel 30, 32, 34, it will inevitably
15 make contact with at least one of the insulation displacement contacts 43, 44, 45.
   The conductor may be, but is not required to be, centred and aligned in the
   channel and may be misaligned in the channel. This also facilitates electrical
   connection if the conductor is not placed in a straight line in the channel.
   In the illustrated form, the insulation displacement contacts 43, 44, 45 are offset 1
20 mm in total from each other across the width of the respective channel. In
   alternative embodiments, the insulation displacement contacts may be offset
   across the entire width of the channel, and offset any distance from another
   insulation displacement contact. In another form, only one contact is offset
   whereas at least two are aligned.
25 Further, the insulation displacement contacts 43, 44, 45 are spaced longitudinally
   in the respective channel. In the illustrated embodiment, the insulation
   displacement contacts 43, 44, 45 also extend longitudinally in the channel 30, 32,
   34. This embodiment is advantageous as it enables the contacts 40 to pierce the
   insulation and make an electrical connection rather than cutting the insulation and
                                              10
   9596924_1 (GHMatters) P104163.AU.1

   severing the core of the conductor 12. In alternative embodiments, the contacts
   may be spaced longitudinally and overlapping or spaced apart longitudinally.
   To further assist in the orientation of the conductors in the channels, at least one
   guide is disposed in the at least one of the channels 30, 32, 34. In the illustrated
 5 embodiment, a plurality of guides 46, 48, 50 is shown in each channel. The
   guides 46, 48, 50 facilitate the electrical connection between the insulated
   conductors and the at least one insulation displacement contact by assisting in
   positioning of the conductors. The guides 46, 48, 50 project in the respective
   channels 30, 32, 34 so as to form constrictions in the channel width such that
10 thicker conductors (in the order of 2.5 mm2) are required to lie in a tortuous path
   within the respective channel 30, 32, 34. For small conductors (in the order of 1
   mm 2) the conductors arranged to remain in a straight path in the channel
   substantially central within the channel.
   These guides are disposed adjacent respective ones of the contacts so that
15 regardless of whether the a thicker conductor aligned in a tortuous path in the
   channel or a smaller cable in a straight path in the channel, the conductor is
   presented to the contacts in a manner that at least one contact will pierce and make
   contact with the conductor core by a glancing cut (i.e., is offset from the centre of
   the core) that will not sever the core.
20 The conductors 12 are flexible and able to bend within each channel 30, 32, 34 to
   follow the indirect path formed by the guides 46, 48, 50. Together, the guides 46,
   48, 50 and the lateral and longitudinal position of the insulation displacement
   contacts 43, 44, 45 in the channels 30, 32, 34 are configured to facilitate an
   effective electrical connection is made between the contacts 43, 44, 45 and the
25 conductors 12. In the illustrated embodiment, guides are positioned adjacent the
   insulation displacement contacts. Additional guides may be disposed in the
   channel along its length to ensure a snug fit for the conductors in the channels. In
   an alternative embodiment, the guides may be disposed to define a tortuous path
   for each conductor without having specifically placed insulation displacement
                                               11
   9596924_1 (GHMatters) P104163.AU.1

   contacts. In a further alternative embodiment, the channel may be configured to
   define a tortuous path without the use of guide or specifically placed insulation
   displacement contacts.
   In an example, a 1.0 mm2 conductor is received in the illustrated 2.5 mm 2 channel
 5 32. In the illustrated embodiment, the lateral distance between the guides is about
    1 mm, and the insulation displacement contacts are offset laterally about 1.0mm.
   Because of the guides 46, 48, 50, the conductor 12E will be centred within the
   respective channel 32 and directly overlying the insulation displacement contacts
   43, 44, 45 such that, when the conductor 12E is received in the channel an
10 effective electrical connection is achieved between at least one of the insulation
   displacement contacts 43, 44, 45 and the conductor 12.
   Each channel 30, 32, 34 includes surrounding walls and a bottom surface. The
   walls are more or less parallel to one another and perpendicular the bottom
   surface. The guides 46, 48, 50 protrude from the walls 24 toward the centre of
15 each channel 30, 32, 64. In alternative embodiments, the guides may protrude
   from the bottom surface to force the conductor to one side or the other. In
   particular, if one large channel was used, then the guides protruding from the
   bottom surface may be beneficial to facilitate electrical connection between the
   contacts and the conductors by forming less defined channels without surrounding
20 walls.
   In a further example, a 2.0 mm2 conductor is received in the illustrated 2.5mm
   channel. The position of the guides 46, 48, 50 in each channel 30, 32, 34, and the
   lateral distance of 1.0mm between the guides 46, 48, 50 relative to the size of the
   conductor, urge the conductor to wind and bend about the guides 46, 48, 50 and
25 follow the tortuous path defined by the guides 46, 48, 50. In this way, an effective
   electrical connection is made between at least one contact 43, 44, 45 and the
   conductor.
   In yet a further example, a 2.5 mm2 conductor is received in the illustrated 2.5mm
   channel. In this case, the conductors snugly fits within each channel 30, 32, 34,
                                             12
   9596924_1 (GHMatters) P104163.AU.1

   and the guides 46, 48, 50 will indent (and slightly bend) the conductor. Again, the
   position of the guides 46, 48, 50 and the insulation displacement contacts 43, 44,
   45 will ensure an effective electrical connection is made.
   The electrical connector 10 includes a retaining portion 35 for retaining the
 5 conductors 12 in the channels. Further, when the first 14 and second 15 parts are
   moved to the closed position, an engaging arrangement 36 forces engagement
   between the at least one conductor with the at least one insulation displacement
   contact. The retaining portion 35 forms part of the engaging arrangement 36. The
   retaining portion 35 includes at least one projection extending from an internal
10 surface of the first part 14 towards the second part 15 and corresponding to the at
   least one channel. In the illustrated embodiment, the first part 14 includes three
   projections 37, 38, 39 which correspond to each of the three channels 30, 32, 34,
   and more specifically correspond to the position of the insulation displacement
   contacts 43, 44, 45 in the channels 30, 32, 34. In the illustrated embodiment, the
15 projections 37, 38, 39 are rectangular and extend longitudinally corresponding to
   the length of the set of insulation displacement contacts 41 and dimensioned to fit
   within the respective channel 30, 32, 34. In the closed position, the projections
   37, 38, 39 overlie the insulation displacement contacts 43, 44, 45 and engage the
   conductors 12 to press down on the conductors 12 in the channels 30, 32, 34 and
20 thus retain the conductors 12 in the channels and maintain the electrical
   connection between the contacts 43, 44, 45 and the conductors 12.
   The engaging arrangement 36 also includes secondary projections 50 which press
   down on the cable 13 to retain the cable 13 in position when the connector is in
   the closed position.
25 As discussed above, the connector includes a lock 22 (Fig. 8E in a close-up view).
   In the closed position, the part 14 is locked to the part 15 by the lock 22. In the
   illustrated embodiment, the lock 22 is slideable relative to the connector 10
   between a locked (Fig. 8D) and an unlocked position (Fig. 8C). When the lock 22
   is in the locked position a positive connection is established. The lock 22 is
                                              13
   9596924_1 (GHMatters) P104163.AU.1

   beneficial as it allows users to confidently lock the connector 10 rapidly and there
   are no loose parts to be misplaced or inadvertently fall off. The lock 22 has an
   internal groove and a flange which extend longitudinally (not shown).
   The part 15 includes a rail 52 which is configured to fit within the internal groove
 5 of the lock 22 such that the lock 22 slides back and forth along the rail 52 of the
   part 15. The rail 52 is formed along the outer edge of the part 15 opposite the
   hinge.
   The part 14 includes a tab 54 which is configured to engage with the flange of the
   lock 22 to lock the part 14 in relation to the part 15. The tab 54 is positioned
10 along the outer edge of the lock 22 aligned with the rail 52 and opposite the hinge.
   It is understood that the lock and the rail may be located on either part of the
   body, and the tab may be located on the opposite part of the body.
   Figs 8A to 8E illustrate the operation of the connector 10 to clamp the TPS 13,
   and are arranged sequentially.
15 First, referring to Fig. 8A, the part 14 of the body 11 is moved to an open position
   in relation to the part 15. A section of the outer sheath 19 of the cable 13 is
   removed that equivalent to approximately the length of the channels (e.g.
   markings 23 may assist to measure this length). Only the outer sheath 19 is
   removed.
20 Referring to Fig. 8B, once the outer sheath 19 is removed, the conductors 12 are
   inserted into the respective channels 30, 32, 34.
   Referring to Fig. 8C, the part 14 is closed until it 'clicks'. The audible 'click'
   indicates a successful snap-fit connection 16 between the part 14 and the part 15.
   After closing the lock 22 is moved from the unlocked position to the locked
25 position as shown in Fig 8c by sliding it across the body to the position as shown
   in Fig. 8D where it engages the tab 54.
   A further embodiment of an electrical connector is shown in Figs. 9 to 12. Like
   numerals are used for like features. The primary difference between the second

   embodiment of the connector and the first embodiment of the connector is the
   engaging arrangement 136 is adjustable to accommodate different sizes of the
   insulated conductors that are arranged to be received in the at least one channel.
   In this way, when the first and second parts are in the closed position, the
 5 engaging arrangement 136 forces the at least one conductor into engagement with
   the at least one insulation displacement contact regardless of the size of the at
   least one insulated conductor.
   In the illustrated embodiment and best shown in Figs. 9, 10A and 1OB, the
   engaging arrangement 136 includes at least one base projection in the form of
10 three projections 137, 138, 139 positioned in the at least one channel. In one
   form, the three projections 137, 138, 139 correspond to the number of channels
   30, 32, 34. It is understood, for example, that one channel may accommodate all
   three conductors. The engaging arrangement 136 also includes at least one
   secondary projection 150, which is in the form of two secondary projections 150.
15 As discussed above, Fig. 9 illustrates the body 11 of the electrical connector 10
   that is formed from the two parts 14 and 15, which are hinged together and
   movable relative to each other between the open position (Figs, 9, 1OA) and the
   closed position (Fig. 11 A). The first part 14 includes the three channels 30, 32, 34
   for receiving the conductors 12. The connector 10 is arranged to receive and
20 clamp the insulated conductors 12A, 12E, 12N when in the closed position.
   The projections 137, 138, 139 extend from the first part 14 towards the second
   part 15. The three projections 137, 138, 139 correspond to the position of the
   insulation displacement contacts 43, 44, 45 in the channels 30, 32, 34. The
   projections 137, 138, 139 are rectangular and dimensioned to fit within the
25 respective channels 30, 32, 34, and extend longitudinally in the channels 30, 32,
   34. In the closed position, the projections 137, 138, 139 force the conductors 12
   into engagement with the insulation displacement contacts 43, 44, 45 in each
   channel 30, 32, 34 to effectively make the electrical connection. In the illustrated
   embodiment, the projections 137, 138, 139 overlie the insulation displacement
                                             15
   9596924_1 (GHMatters) P104163.AU.1

   contacts 43, 44, 45 to press down on the conductors 12 at the position where
   electrical contact is made.
   The secondary projections 150 extend laterally across the cable 13 and at either
   end of the channels 30, 32, 34 to press down on the cable 13 to retain the cable 13
 5 in position when the connector 10 is in the closed position. The secondary
   projections 150 complement the function of the projections 137, 138, 139.
   The length of the projections 137, 138, 139 is adjustable to accommodate different
   size conductors. Likewise, the length of the secondary projections 150 is
   adjustable to accommodate different size conductors. In the illustrated
10 embodiment, the length of the projections 137, 138, 139 and the secondary
   projections 150 is adjustable in that they are interconnected to form a removable
   engaging arrangement in the form of a packing 100. The packing 100
   accommodates insulated conductors to vary the distance between the projections
    137, 138, 139 and the conductors 12 in the closed position. The removable
15 engagement arrangement 136 in the form of the packing 100 overlies the
   projections 37, 38, 39 and the secondary projections 50 of the first embodiment
   and respectively, the projections 137, 138, 139 extend the length of the
   projections 37, 38, 39, and likewise, the secondary projections 150 extend the
   length of the secondary projections 50. As a result, a smaller size conductor may
20 be effectively electrically connected to the electrical connector. The projections
    137, 138, 139 of the packing 100 fills otherwise empty space in the channels 30,
   32, 34 to facilitate this electrical connection between the conductors 12 and the
   contacts 43, 44, 45. In the closed position, the packing 100 presses down on the
   conductors 12 forcing the conductors to make the electrical connection with the
25 contacts 43, 44, 45.
   The packing 100 is removable from the first part 14 to facilitate rapid connection
   of different size insulated conductors 12. In the illustrated embodiment, the
   packing 100 is engaged with the first part 14 by snap fit engagement. The
   packing 100 is formed from a resilient material and an internal surface (not
                                               16

   shown) of the projections 137, 138, 139 include small lugs designed to fit within
   dimples 52 formed on the projections 37, 38, 39 to snap fit together. In addition,
   the secondary projections 50 on the first part include lugs 54 which are designed
   to fit within dimples formed on an internal surface of the secondary projections
 5  150 (not shown) to snap fit together.
   For example, in Figs. 9 to 1 IB, 1mm2 conductors are arranged to be received in
   the channels 30, 32, 34 of the second part 15. The packing 100 snap fits onto the
   first part 14. A portion of the outer sheath of the cable 13 is removed to allow the
   inner insulated conductors 12A, 12E, 12N to be revealed. The conductors 12 are
10 arranged in the channels 30, 32, 34 and pressed down by hand on the contacts 43,
   44, 45. The guides 48, 48, 50 discussed in relation to the first embodiment may
   be included in the channels of the second embodiment to facilitate the electrical
   connection between the conductors 12 and the contacts 43, 44, 45.
   As shown in Figs. 11A and 11B, 1.0mm2 size conductors are shown in use with
15 the connector 10 and the packing 100. The electrical connector 10 is moved to the
   closed position by closing the first part 14 in relation to the first part 15. The
   packing 100 presses down on the 1.0mm 2 conductors 12 in the channels in the
   channels 30, 32, 34. The secondary projections 150 press down on the cable 13 to
   also retain the cable in position within the electrical connector 10.
20 In alternative embodiments, the retaining arrangement may be adjusted by moving
   the projections into position pressing on the conductors through a slidable or
   rotatable actuator or a ratchet mechanism. In each case, the projections would be
   contained within the body (either the first or the second part), and then moved into
   a position where they are pressing on the conductors to reinforce the electrical
25 connection. The projections may or may not be required to move back into
   position within the body.
   Further, the packing may be used with 1.5 mm2 conductors. A different size
   packing with projections of different dimensions may be suitable with 1.5 mm2
                                              17
   9596924_1 (GHMatters) P104163.AU.1

   conductors. Alternatively, the packing may be used with any size conductor by
   employing different size projections.
   Lastly, Fig. 12 shows removal of the packing 100 from the first part 14 of the
   body 11 so the connector 10 may be used with 2.5mm2 conductors. The packing
 5  100 is easily removed through manual force from the first part 14 as it is engaged
   by snap fit.
   Variations and modifications may be made to the parts previously described
   without departing from the spirit or ambit of the disclosure.
   In the claims which follow and in the preceding description of the invention,
10 except where the context requires otherwise due to express language or necessary
   implication, the word "comprise" or variations such as "comprises" or
   "comprising" is used in an inclusive sense, i.e. to specify the presence of the
