          METHOD FOR THE DETECTION OF ANALYTES VIA LUMINESCENCE
                                                               QUENCHING
This is a divisional of Australian Patent Application No. 2013354896, the entire contents
of which are incorporated herein by reference.
Field of the invention
The present invention relates to the detection of analytes, in particular explosives and
explosives-related materials.
Background to the invention
The ability to reliably detect a specific compound even at low concentrations is a
continuing challenge, and there is the on-going need to provide new methodologies and
devices to do this. The detection of explosives and explosives-related compounds that are
commonly used in terrorist attacks and war zones is a particularly pressing need. Although
there is often talk of dirty bombs, biological and nuclear terrorism, and improvised
explosive devices (IEDs) the majority of weapons still use nitroaromatic and nitroaliphatic
materials either as the explosive, detonator, accelerant or taggant. There remains therefore
a clear need to be able to detect these materials with suitably high sensitivity and
selectivity.
Many commercially available sensors rely on detection of secondary species that are
produced when a target analyte (target molecule) is present in an environment.             For
example, in such sensors the target analyte may be decomposed by chemical reaction to
produce another molecule that is itself then detected. This approach to detection is indirect
in nature and while being sensitive can be somewhat inefficient due to the time taken from
sampling to detection. Other detection methods require direct contact sampling. The
disadvantage of these latter methods is that they are reliant on a specific area of a substrate
where the explosive analyte is present to be sampled, for example, swabbed.
An approach for direct detection of a target analyte relies on the use of luminescent
compounds. When some compounds are exposed to light of a certain wavelength, they
absorb the light (photoexcitation) and emit light of a different wavelength (luminescence,

                                                  -2
     which can either be fluorescence or phosphorescence).            This emitted light can be
     measured/detected.      However, certain analyte molecules may also interact with the
     (excited) luminescent compound to cause an increase or decrease in the intensity of the
     emitted light. This change can also be detected and, as such, can be used to indicate the
 5   presence of the analyte molecules.       Sensors embodying the luminescence quenching
     approach are commercially available. The sensing materials are comprised of thin films
     containing luminescent conjugated polymers. These sensors can demonstrate high
     sensitivity but there is scope for improvement in terms of selectivity, especially when the
     intention is to detect an explosives or explosive-related materials.      False positives can
10   occur since every-day products, such as cosmetics, coffee and solvents, can illicit the same
     qualitative decrease in luminescent intensity as explosives and explosive-related materials.
     This is a significant limitation on the usefulness of these existing conjugated polymer
     sensors.
15   Against this background it would be desirable to provide a sensor technology that does not
     suffer these drawbacks. It would be particularly desirable to provide a sensor technology
     that shows high sensitivity to key analytes, such as explosives and explosives-related
     materials, and that allows the presence of such key analytes to be identified by a
     characteristic response that per se is specific and selective for those analytes. In this way
20   the presence of every-day chemicals would give a different response to that of the desired
     explosives and explosives-related materials.
     Summary of the invention
25   In an embodiment the present invention provides a method of detecting an analyte, which
     method comprises:
      (i)     allowing a luminescent compound comprising a triaryl amine moiety to interact
     with the analyte and measuring the luminescent properties of the compound due to
30    exposure to the analyte;

     The present invention also provides a sensor device for the detection of an analyte based
     on a change in the measured luminescence, the sensor device comprising a sensing element

     the present invention.

      Detailed discussion of the invention
20    In accordance with the present invention it has been found that certain compounds
      comprising a triaryl amine moiety exhibit a characteristic luminescence response when
      exposed to analyte molecules of particular interest, i.e. explosives and explosives-related
      materials. The nature of this response means that these compounds have great potential in
      the kind of direct sensing methodology described. The underlying mechanism associated
25    with that methodology is of course known, but the present invention is believed to
      represent a significant advance in the art.
      In broad terms, the method of the invention comprises:

   WO 2014/085858                                                            PCT/AU2013/001410
                                                   -6
     (i)      allowing a luminescent compound comprising a triaryl amine moiety to interact
     with the analyte and measuring the luminescent properties of the compound during
     exposure to the analyte;
 5   (ii)     detecting a difference between the luminescent properties measured in step (i) and
     the luminescent properties of the compound prior to measurement of luminescent
     properties in step (i); and
     (iii)    determining whether the analyte is present based on the difference in luminescent
10   properties detected in step (ii).
     In the context of the method of the invention it is possible for step (ii) to be undertaken in a
     variety of ways.      In one embodiment, this step may be undertaken based on actual
     measurement of the luminescent properties of the compound comprising a triaryl amine
15   moiety prior to measurement of luminescent properties in step (i). In this embodiment the
     invention provides a method of detecting an analyte, which method comprises:
     (a)      exciting a luminescent compound comprising a triaryl amine moiety and measuring
     the luminescent properties of the compound;
20
     (b)      allowing the compound to interact with the analyte and measuring the luminescent
     properties of the compound due to exposure to the analyte;
     (c)      detecting a difference between the luminescent properties measured in steps (a) and
25   (b); and
     (d)      determining whether the analyte is present based on the difference in luminescent
     properties detected in step (c).
30   This embodiment relies on there being a change in measured luminescent properties as a
     result of exposure of the luminescent compound to an analyte.                    The real time

   WO 2014/085858                                                         PCT/AU2013/001410
                                                 -7
      implementation of this embodiment would involve excitation and measurement of
     luminescent properties prior to sampling for an analyte.           Determining the initial
     luminescent response of the compound (i.e. before exposure to an analyte) is important in
     order to give a control or base reading against which any subsequent change in
 5   luminescent response can be assessed.
     In certain embodiments triaryl amine compounds used in the present invention may show
     advantageous selectivity towards a variety of analytes. Specifically, the compounds can
     show luminescence quenching in the presence of explosive analytes and/or taggants. More
10   specifically, the compounds show luminescence quenching in the presence of analytes
     and/or taggants that contain one or more nitro groups. Preferably, the compounds show
     luminescence quenching in the presence of a nitroaromatic analyte.
     Broadly speaking, the invention is believed to be of value since it provides a viable
15   alternative to existing technology. However, of particular significance is the fact that that
     triaryl amine compounds used in accordance with the invention exhibit a fundamentally
     different photoluminescent response to certain analytes when compared with compounds,
     such as conjugated polymers, used in existing sensors that operate on the same principles.
     More particularly, triaryl amine compounds used in the present invention may exhibit a
20   characteristic luminescence response to analytes that allows explosives and explosives
     related materials to be readily detected as against every-day chemicals that would
     otherwise have an impact on detection. In other words, triaryl amine compounds used in
     accordance with the invention may provide qualitative detection selectivity with respect to
     explosives    and   explosives-related materials. More    specifically the triaryl    amine
25   compounds may exhibit a detectable response (decrease or increase) in the luminescence in
     the presence of the explosives and explosives-related materials whereas there is no
     response, or no significant response, in the photoluminescence in the presence of
     non-explosive related (everyday) materials such as perfumes, coffee etc. In an alternative
     embodiment the triaryl amine compounds may exhibit a particular response (e.g. a
30   decrease) in the luminescence in the presence of the explosives and explosives-related
     materials whereas the opposite response (an increase in the context of the example given)

   WO 2014/085858                                                               PCT/AU2013/001410
                                                     -8
     in the photoluminescence in the presence of non-explosive related (everyday) materials.
     These response characteristics are advantageous when it comes to detecting analytes of
     interest.
 5   Whilst the triaryl amine compounds used in accordance with the present invention may be
     useful for selective detection of a variety of target analytes (and the scope of this may be
     investigated for any given compound), the compounds are believed to have particular value
     in relation to the selective detection of explosives and explosives-related materials as
     analytes.    In the context of the present invention these analytes are nitrogen-containing
10   species and include explosives per se as well as related (functional) materials such as
     accelerants, taggants and the like.
     By way of specific example, the analyte may be selected from 2,4,6- trinitrotoluene (TNT
     high explosive), 2,3-dinitro-2,3-dimethylbutane (a tag'ant typically used in the explosive
15   Semtex), 2,4,6-trinitro-m-xylene (TNX), 2,4,6-trinitrochlorobenzene              (picryl chloride),
     2,4,6-trinitrophenol (picric acid); ammonium picrate (Explosive D); 2,4,6-trinitro-m-cresol
     (TNC), 2,4,6-trinitroresorcinol (styphnic acid), 2,4,6-trinitroanisole (TNA, methyl picrate),
     2,4,6-trinitrophenetole       (TNP,     ethyl    picrate),    2,4,6-trinitroaniline     (picramide,
     1-monoamino-2,4,6-trinitrobenzene, MATB), 1,3-diamino-2,4,6-trinitrobenzene (DATB),
20    1,3,5-triamino-2,4,6-trinitrobenzene      (TATB),      and   2,4,6-N-tetranitro-N-methylaniline
     (tetryl,   2,4,6-trinitrophenylmethyinitramine),     2-amino-4,6-dinitrotoluene,      4-amino-2,6
     dinitrotoluene,         2-amino-4-nitrotoluene,      3,5-dinitroaniline,        1,3-dinitrobenzene,
      1,4-dinitrobenzene,        1,2-dinitrobenzene,       2,4-dinitrotoluene,       2,3-dinitrotoluene,
     2,6-dinitrotoluene, nitromethane, 3-nitroaniline, 2,4,6-trinitroaniline, nitroamines such as
25    1,3,5-trinitroperhydro- 1,3,5-triazine,    and     nitroesters    such      as    [3-nitrooxy-2,2
     bis(nitrooxymethyl)propyl]nitrate. It will be appreciated that these and other nitrated
     analytes may be found with other compounds in an explosive mixture. It will also be
     appreciated that analytes need to have sufficient vapour pressure to be detectable.
30   The present invention relies on the use of certain compounds that have characteristic
     structural features and optical properties.      With respect to structure the compounds can
     broadly be classified as luminescent triaryl amines and the presence of the triaryl amine

   WO 2014/085858                                                          PCT/AU2013/001410
                                                  -9
      moiety is believed to be significant to the usefulness of the compounds in the context of
      the present invention.
      The triaryl amine compound must also exhibit suitable optical properties to be useful in the
  5  present invention. That is, the compounds must be capable of interacting with an analyte
     molecule thereby causing a detectable change in luminescence intensity. Preferably, the
     compounds are. fluorescent.
     Furthermore, triaryl amine compounds .useful in the present invention will generally be
10   used in sensor devices in the solid phase, usually as coatings/films on a substrate. It is
     obviously important that the compounds retain the desirable optical properties when
     provided in this form. Sensor devices useful in the context of the present invention will be
     discussed in more detail below.
15   Characterising the structure of the compounds in more detail, they can be regarded as
     conjugated compounds that comprise a triaryl amine moiety.          Generally, one or more,
     preferably one, conjugated molecular structure is bound to each of the three aryl groups of
     the triaryl amine moiety. The conjugated molecular structure is bonded to the aryl group in
     such a way so as to preserve conjugation with the aryl group. The conjugated molecular
20   structures may be the same or different.
     In this context the term "conjugated molecular structure" means a structure comprising at
     least 5 carbon atoms with alternating single and multiple bonds that provide delocalization
     of electrons. The conjugated molecular structure may include alkenyl, alkynyl and/or
     conjugated cyclic moieties. The presence of conjugated molecular structures attached to
25   the triaryl amine compounds used in the present invention is critical to their usefulness in
     the context of the present invention.      This may be understood with reference to the
     underlying mechanism by which the compounds are believed to function in the present
     invention. Absorption by the compound of a photon produces a singlet excited state. An
     analyte molecule may interact with the excited triaryl amine compound leading to
30   oxidation of the excited state with the result that there is no luminescence. This effect is
     known as oxidative luminescence quenching. The conjugated molecular structure may be

   WO 2014/085858                                                           PCT/AU2013/001410
                                                   -10
     at least partially conjugated provided that the intended functionality in the context of the
     invention is preserved.
     Advantageously, triaryl amine compounds useful in the present invention have been found
     to exhibit selective luminescence quenching when exposed to explosives and explosives
 5   related materials.     In contrast, the compounds may exhibit a qualitatively different
     fluorescent response in the presence of everyday chemicals. It will be appreciated that for
     oxidative luminescence quenching to occur the analyte must have an electron affinity
     sufficient to separate the exciton that is formed on excitation of the triaryl amine
     compound. It is well known in the art how to modulate the optical and electronic properties
10   of conjugated molecules and this can be applied to the optical and electronic properties of
     the triaryl amine compounds used in the current invention.
     The conjugated molecular structure may be polymeric in character in the sense that it
     includes repeat units within its structure. However, this is not essential and the conjugated
15   molecular structure may be non-polymeric in character. In the latter case, the conjugated
     molecular structure may include linear and/or branched moieties. When branched, the
     conjugated molecular structure may be a dendritic structure. In the case of a dendrimer the
     triaryl amine moiety could be at the centre of the dendrimer, in the dendron or both.
20   It will be appreciated that by its very structure the triaryl amine moiety provides branching
     in the structure of the overall compound. The triaryl amine moiety may be the only part of
     the molecule that provides branching or it may provide one of several branching points
     depending upon the architecture of the conjugated molecular structure. From this it will be
     understood that when the triaryl amine compound is a polymer, the triaryl amine moiety
25   could be part of the main chain, part of a side chain group, or both. It will also be
     appreciated that there could be more than one triaryl amine group in a material. For
     example, in a polymer the triaryl amine group could be present as part of a 'monomer unit'
     repeated along the polymer backbone. Also each DENDRON of a dendrimer could contain
     one or more triaryl amine groups. In the case where more than one triaryl amine group is
30   present and they are linked sequentially an individual aryl group may be attached to two or
     more nitrogen atoms.

     The conjugated molecular structure may comprise one or more aryl or heteroaryl groups
     that can be linked directly together or via one or more alkenyl or acetylenyl groups. The
     connection of the conjugated molecular structure to the aryl moieties of the triaryl amine
 5   group can be via an aryl, heteroaryl, alkenyl or acetylenyl carbon atom of the conjugated
     molecular structure. Typically, however, connection is via an aryl or heteroaryl moiety of
     the conjugated molecular structure. Where connection is via a heteroaryl group, this may
     be via a heteroatom. In heteroaryl groups the hetero-atom may be N, 0 or S. The aryl
     groups are usually benzene rings, and these are typically substituted at position 2, 3, 4, 5 or
10   6 to provide the remainder of the conjugated molecular structure. The heteroaryl group is
     usually a 5- or 6-membered ring structure, and may be selected from thiophene, pyridine,
     pyrimidine, triazine, etc. The use of poly-aromatic ring structures is also possible. The use
     of fused ring aryl and heteroaryl ring systems is also possible, including naphthalene,
     anthracene, carbazole, fluorene etc. It is also possible that two or more aryl groups of the
15   triaryl amine compound are linked by a conjugated molecular structure. A fundamental
     requirement however is that the number and combination of conjugated molecular
     structures present in the triaryl amine compound must be such that the singlet excited state
     of the compound can be oxidised by the analyte. It will be further appreciated that the aryl
     and/or heteroaryl groups can be substituted with further non-conjugated groups to provide
20   the required solubility and processability. A non-exhaustive list of suitable non-conjugated
     (surface) groups is included below.
     In terms of a molecular formula the conjugated molecular structure may be represented by

     molecular structure comprised of moieties as defined above, X1 , X 2 , X3 are independently
     selected from conjugated moieties and/or nitrogen atoms linking Ar with respective groups
     R 1 , R2 , R 3 and x, y, and z are independently 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4.

     When x, y or z is greater than 1, the respective groups X1 , X 2 and X 3 may be the same or
     different. For example, when x is 2, the linkage between the group Ar and the group R1
     will be of formula -XI-Xl- in which each X may be the same or different.
10   When one or more of X 1, X2 and X3 is a nitrogen atom, the nitrogen atom is bonded
     directly to a conjugated group or moiety so that the lone pair of the nitrogen atom can
     interact with the conjugated group or moiety. Typically, when one or more of X1 , X2 and
     X 3 is a nitrogen atom this nitrogen atom is usually part of a triaryl amine substituted
     moiety.

     In an embodiment the aryl group may be selected from phenyl, napthyl, anthracenyl,
     acenapthyl, fluorenyl and azulenyl. In an embodiment each Ar group is the same and is
     phenyl. In another embodiment, each group Ar is phenyl and R 1, R2 , k 3 are the same.
20   Typically, X 1, X2 , X3 are independently selected from aryl, heteroaryl,. alkenyl or
     acetylenyl groups.
     It is also possible that one or more of X1 , X2 and X3 is a conjugated repeat unit of a
     polymer chain or a conjugated dendrimer.

     In an embodiment, when x and y are zero, R, and R2 may constitute the main part of a
     polymer chain together with two of the aryl groups and the nitrogen atom of the triaryl
     amine moiety of the molecule, with the remaining aryl group, X3 if present and R 3
     providing chain-branching. Alternatively, one of the groups, say R 1, may be a polymer
30   chain with the remainder of the molecule being present as a pendant group (side chain) of
     the polymer chain.          In this case the group R, will also need to provide a point o"

     attachment to the polymer backbone. The remaining groups, R2 and R3 may be conjugated
     molecular structures as defined above, for example dendrons or simple linear-conjugated
     species.
 5   Of course, the structure represented by formula (I) may be part of a branched compound
     such as a dendrimer. In that case at least one of R1, R2, and R3 has to be a dendron.
     Alternatively, R1, R2 , and R3can simply be linear conjugate sequences, i.e. the N atom is at
     the centre.
10   When at least one conjugated molecular structure is a dendron, the compound may be
     represented by formula I in which one or more of R1 , R2, and R3 may be the same or
     different group of formula:
                                           -(DENDRON)-B
15
     in which DENDRON represents a conjugated dendritic molecular structure comprising a
     plurality of chain branches each of which terminates with a distal aryl or heteroaryl group,
     and B represents an optional surface group attached to the distal aryl and/or heteroaryl
     group terminating a chain branch. The individual chain branches of DENDRON may be
20   the same or different. When present the surface groups in DENDRON may be the same or
     different. When a surface group is not present on a particular chain branch, that chain
     branch will terminate with the terminal aryl or heteroaryl group.
     In this embodiment the outer surface presented by the molecule provides an element of
25   control of the solubility and processability of the molecule and thus changes to the internal
     electronic structure should be possible without unacceptably affecting the processing
     properties and vice versa . Therefore, this embodiment may provide an opportunity of
     optimizing the electronic and processing properties independently which should give
     improved manufacturability of electronically optimized materials.

     and hydroxyhalo(C 1 .4)alkyl groups. A surface group that allows further reaction may
     interact to provide cross-linking. In this case the surface group may be selected from, for
10   example, as alkene, (meth)acrylate, an oxetane containing group or silicon-containing
     group.

     Triaryl amine compounds used in the present invention may be made by the application or
     adaptation of known techniques. By way of example, reference may be made to
 5   WO01/59030, Ellen J. Wren, Karyn Mutkins, Muhsen AIjada, Paul L. Burn,* Paul
     Meredith* and George Vamvounis Polym. Chem., 2010, 1, 1117-1126.
     The sensor devices in which the triaryl amine compounds described herein may be used
     are of conventional design and are operated in conventional manner. A typical device is
10   shown in Figure 1. An excitation source is used to supply the electromagnetic radiation.
     that interacts with the compound being used to cause the compound to generate light. The
     compound is provided on a suitable substrate, thereby forming a sensing element. The

   WO 2014/085858                                                            PCT/AU2013/001410
                                                    - 24
      excitation source may be an LED, a laser, cathode lamp, or the like. The device also
      includes a light detector that receives light from the compound. This detector delivers an
      output signal that is indicative of the intensity of light emitted by the compound. The
      device will also include componentry (microprocessors) that allows the output of the light
 5    detector to be visualized or otherwise represented for interpretation. The device will also
      include one or more temperature control elements for regulating and detecting the
      temperature of parts of the device as necessary for optimum operation.
      In the context of the present invention, the triaryl amine compound will be provided as a
10    coating/film on a substrate over or through which a gas to be analysed is passed or
      delivered. Herein the expression "sensing element" is used to denote the coated substrate.
      Interestingly, the form the substrate takes has been found to influence the efficacy of triaryl
      amine compounds in selectively detecting analyte molecules of interest (explosives and
     .explosives-related materials). Thus, it has been found that non-planar substrates may be
15    preferred. Depending upon geometry the substrate material may need to be effectively
      transparent to the wavelength of light that is to be used to excite the triaryl amine
      compound used. The substrate material must also be non-reactive with respect to target
      analytes.
20    It has also been found that the thickness of the coating/film of triaryl amine compound has
      an impact on detection efficacy. The thickness may be optimized by experimentation for a
      given combination of substrate and triaryl amine compound. Typically, the coating/film
      thickness will be up to 100 nm, for example in the range 10-100 nm. The compound may
      be deposited by conventional techniques.
25
      In one embodiment the substrate may take the form of a tube with the compound provided
      on the internal surface of the tube. The tube typically has a circular cross-section. The
      optimum dimensions for the tube, as well as suitable materials from which the tube is
      made, may be determined experimentally. In a preferred embodiment the compound is
30    provided on the internal surface of a capillary tube. The capillary tube may be made of a
      glass, such as a borosilicate glass, or silica. Typically, the capillary will have an internal

   WO 2014/085858                                                          PCT/AU2013/001410
                                                   - 25
     diameter of from 100pm to 1 mm. The length of the capillary is usually no longer than
      100 mm. Useful capillaries with the required externally and internal diameters are
     commercially available and can be cut to the appropriate length. For example, such tubes
     can have the following dimensions: length = 30 or 54 mm with the outside diameter of
 5    5 mm and internal diameter of 0.5 mm.
     Figure 1 shows a simplified arrangement of components that would be used in a sensor
     device. The figure shows a capillary tube coated on its inner surface with a thin film of
     optically active triaryl amine compound. The compound is excited by exposure to light of
10   a suitable wavelength and the compound's response to this in terms of photoluminescence
     measured using a suitable detector. The excited compound is then exposed to air to be
     analysed (termed "contaminated air" in the figure). Any change in luminescence intensity
     due to analyte(s) present in the air interacting with the excited compound is also detected.
     The response of the excited compound to a range of analytes has been pre-determined and
15   this enables the result obtained to be interpreted. However, the qualitative response per se
     of triaryl amine compounds used in the present invention may allow immediate
     identification. of explosives and explosives-related materials, even when present with
     everyday chemicals, such as cosmetics and perfumes.
20   The substrate bearing the triaryl amine compound (i.e., the sensing element) will be
     replaced from time to time and as such can be regarded as a consumable. The sensing
     capability of the device may also be tailored/tuned by installing a substrate bearing a triaryl
     amine compound having the desired sensing capability with respect to the analyte of
     interest. Other changes may then also need to be made based on the compound being used,
25   e.g. device operating temperature, excitation wavelength etc. It will be appreciated from
     this that the sensing element is a commercial commodity in its own right for use with a
     sensing device that is adapted to receive the substrate. The sensing element also forms part
     of the present invention.
30   The present invention also provides a sensing device including a sensing element as
     described herein.

     Embodiments of the present invention are illustrated with reference to the following
     non-limiting examples and comparative examples.
 5   Comparative Example 1
     A conventional device containing a fluorescent conjugated polymer was found to show a
      -1-2% decrease in fluorescence when exposed to a standard TNT source (not shown in
     Figure 2), which is included with the device for verifying correct operation. However,
10   when the device is exposed to a series of everyday cosmetics, chemicals, solvents etc the
     majority were "detected" by a decrease in the fluorescence signal.       The device was
     exposed to the various species one at a time.      The conventional device cannot readily
     distinguish between explosives and everyday chemicals.
15   Example 1
     The channel of a glass capillary with the following dimensions: length = 54 mm with the
     outside diameter = 5 mm and internal diameter 0.5 mm, was coated with a triphenylamine
     centred thiophene-containing compound by blowing a solution of the material in toluene
20   through the capillary with a flow of nitrogen gas. The coated capillary was then exposed
     sequentially to vapours of a range of everyday chemicals and nitroaromatic compounds
     (see Figure 3).     Vapour mixtures of species were not used.         While exposure to
     nitroaromatic compounds results in a quenching of the fluorescence signal all the everyday
     chemicals give an increase in the fluorescence signal.    In this way the sensing device
25   shows selectivity.
     In Figure 3 the X-axis (time) denotes the time from commencement of the experiment at
     which the device is exposed to a particular species.

   WO 2014/085858                                                           PCT/AU2013/001410
                                                 -27
      Example 2
     The channel of a glass capillary as above was coated with a triphenylamine centred
     thiophene containing dendrimer (Figure 4) by blowing a solution of the material in toluene
 5   through the capillary with a flow of nitrogen gas. The coated capillary was then exposed
     sequentially to vapours of a range of everyday chemicals and nitroaromatic compounds. As
     with Example 1 the results show that the dendrimer exhibits an increase in fluorescence
     signal when exposed to the vapours from a series of everyday chemicals and quenching
     when it is exposed to the nitroaromatics DNT and pNT. Thus, the modification of the
10   structure, through the addition of dendrons, has not altered the basic sensing properties.
     Comparative Example 2
     A bifluorene dendrimer, which is known to be strongly quenched by nitroaromatic
15   vapours, was. tested inside a glass capillary (same as Example 1) (see Figure 5) to
     determine whether or not it featured the same selectivity observed in the triphenylamine
     based conipounds. The same testing procedure was followed as described for the
     compounds in Example I and 2. The fluorescence signal showed quenching responses with
     all of the everyday chemicals except naphthalene as well as the nitroaromatics. Toluene
20   showed a combination of quenching/enhancement, which could be due to changes in the
     optical properties of the sensing film caused by swelling. This behaviour is similar to that
     of the original Comparative Example 1.
     Example 3
25
     The triphenylamine centred fluorene dendrimer shown in Figure 6 was tested to determine
     whether the triphenyl amine thiophene combination was necessary for the observed
     selectivity. Fluorene only-based compounds, such as the one described in Example 2, do
     not exhibit selectivity. All tests were again performed as in Examples 1, 2, and
30   Comparative Example 2 by coating the inside of the sensing element (glass capillary with
     the same dimensions as Example 1) with the sensing compound. The results show the same

   WO 2014/085858                                                          PCT/AU2013/001410
                                                    -28
       selectivity behaviour as observed with the other triphenylamine-based compounds: only
       the nitroaromatic compounds show quenching of the fluorescence with everyday chemicals
       resulting in an increase in the fluorescence signal. The mono-fluorene compound was also
       found to be more stable to photooxidation than the thiophene-containing compound.
   5
       Example 4
      By changing the thiophene unit of the dendrimer used in Example 2 to two fluorenyl units
      a similar fluorescence response was seen towards a range of everyday chemicals and
 10   nitroaromatic analytes (see Figure 7). When tested in a similar manner to the previous
      examples it was found that as with the mono-fluorene compound from Example 3 the
      photoluminescence intensity was greater and more stable than that obtained with the
      thiophene-containing compounds. It is important to note that all the triphenylamine
      compounds tested and included in the examples showed selectivity to nitroaromatic
 15   vapours.

      Example 7
25
      The triphenylamine-based polymer shown in Figure 8 was tested to determine whether a
      triphenyl amine based polymer could be used to show the necessary selectivity. All tests
      were again performed in a similar manner to Example 1, 2, and Comparative Example 2 by
      coating the inside of the sensing element with the sensing compound. The results show the
30    same selectivity behaviour as observed with the other triphenylamine-based compounds:
      only the nitroaromatic compounds show quenching of the fluorescence with everyday

     chemicals resulting in negligible change in the fluorescence signal. In this example there
     are two triphenyl amine groups per repeat unit in the polymer with them having a common
     phenyl group.
 5   Example 8
     The triphenylamine based compound from Example 6 was tested to determine whether a
     nitroaromatic compound (p-nitrotoluene) could be detected in the presence of other
     chemicals. All tests were again performed in a similar manner to Examples' 1, 2, and
10   Comparative Example 2 by coating the inside of the sensing element with the sensing
     compound. The results, displayed in Figure 9, show that the p-nitrotoluene is detected with
     the associated responses left to right corresponding to I to 18 with 18 being labelled as a
     reference    point.  DNT     is 2,4-dinitrotoluene,    PNT    is  p-nitrotoluene,    DNB      is
      1,4-dinitrobenzene and (p) denotes samples that are perfumes.
15
     Example 9
     The triphenylamine-based compound shown in Figure 10b was tested to further confirm
     that compounds incorporating triphenylamine exhibit selectivity. All tests were again
20   performed as in Examples 1, 2, and Comparative Example 2 by coating the inside of the
     sensing element with the sensing compound. The results shown in Figure 10a across two
     plots show the same selectivity behaviour as observed with the other triphenylamine-based
     compounds: only the nitroaromatic compounds show quenching of the fluorescence with.
     everyday chemicals resulting in an increase in the fluorescence signal.
25
     Example 10
     The triphenylamine-based compound shown in Figure II was investigated to determine
     whether a molecule incorporating multiple triphenylamine units would also exhibit
30   selectivity. Furthermore, the structure differs from many of the previous examples in that
     the triphenylamine is not located at the centre of the molecule but at the periphery. All tests

        were again performed in a similar manner to Examples 1, 2, and Comparative Example 2
        by coating the inside of the sensing element (in this case a capillary with the following
        dimensions: length = 54 mm with the outside diameter = 5 mm and internal diameter = 0.5
        mm) with the sensing compound. The observed behaviour was consistent with the
   5    examples for the other triphenylamine-based compounds with the nitroaromatic DNT
        causing a decrease in the fluorescence signal and the ethanol a small increase.
       Example 11
 10    The compound shown in Figure 12 is similar to that featured in Example 10 but with an
       extended chromophore though the addition of a fluorene unit. All tests were again
       performed in a similar manner to Examples 1, 2, and Comparative Example 2 by coating
       the inside of the sensing element (in this case a capillary with the following dimensions:
       length = 54 mm with the outside diameter = 5 mm and internal diameter 0.5 mm) with the
 15    sensing compound.           The sensing behaviour is similar to that of the monofluorene
      compound in example 10 although the response and recovery of the fluorescence signal
      was slower.
