      WOUND-CONNECTION PADS FOR FLUID INSTILLATION AND NEGATIVE
            PRESSURE WOUND THERAPY, AND SYSTEMS AND METHODS
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS
[0001]     This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/296,806,
filed January 20, 2010, which is incorporated herein in its entirety.
                                           BACKGROUND
Field of the Invention
[0002]     The present invention relates generally to healing of wounds and wound-treatment
therapies. More particularly, but not by way of limitation, the present invention relates to
systems and methods for improving the connection between a wound dressing and negative
pressure wound therapy (NPWT) apparatuses and methods.
Background to the Invention
[0003]      Clinical studies and practice have shown that providing a reduced pressure in
proximity to a tissue site augments and accelerates the growth of new tissue at the tissue site.
The applications of this phenomenon are numerous, but application of reduced pressure has
been particularly successful in treating wounds. This treatment (frequently referred to in the
medical community as "negative pressure wound therapy," "reduced pressure therapy," or
"vacuum therapy") provides a number of benefits, including faster healing and increased
formulation of granulation tissue. Typically, reduced pressure is applied to tissue through a
wound insert (e.g., a porous pad or other manifold device). The wound insert typically contains
cells or pores that are capable of distributing reduced pressure to the tissue and channeling
fluids that are drawn from the tissue. The wound insert can be incorporated into a wound
dressing having other components that facilitate treatment, such as, for example, a drape (e.g.,
adhesive surgical drape). Instillation of fluids (e.g., irrigation fluids and/or medicaments) may
be used in conjunction with negative pressure wound therapy to promote healing and/or
improve efficacy.
[0004]     While NPWT has been highly successful in the promotion of wound closure, healing
many wounds previously thought largely untreatable, some difficulty remains. One common
component of an NPWT system is a device or structure (e.g., connection pad) that connects

                                                  -2
the vacuum (or negative pressure) source (e.g., a vacuum pump) and/or the fluid source to a
wound dressing or components (e.g., foam wound insert within the wound dressing).
[0005]      It may be difficult to accurately characterize the pressure level at the tissue site by
simply measuring the level of reduced pressure that the reduced pressure source is providing,
either at the source or in the conduit lines connecting the source to the wound dressing. Fluid
flow within the primary lumen of tubing associated with NPWT systems may prevent pressure
level measurements at the apparatus (e.g., vacuum source) from accurately indicating the
level or stability of the pressure at the wound itself.
[0006]     While NPWT has been used for some time, NPWT wound dressings, and their
connection to NPWT apparatuses can be difficult to use and time consuming to apply (e.g.,
due at least in part to the number of connections which must be made between wound
dressings and connection pads, and between connection pads and conduits to the NPWT
apparatus).

DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS
[0045]    The term "coupled" is defined as connected, although not necessarily directly, and
not necessarily mechanically; two items that are "coupled" may be integral with each other.

                                                - 10
The terms "a" and "an" are defined as one or more unless this disclosure explicitly requires
otherwise. The terms "substantially," "approximately," and "about" are defined as largely but
not necessarily wholly what is specified, as understood by a person of ordinary skill in the art.
[0046]     The terms "comprise" (and any form of comprise, such as "comprises" and
"comprising"), "have" (and any form of have, such as "has" and "having"), "include" (and any
form of include, such as "includes" and "including") and "contain" (and any form of contain,
such as "contains" and "containing") are open-ended linking verbs. As a result, a method that
"comprises," "has," "includes" or "contains" one or more steps possesses those one or more
steps, but is not limited to possessing only those one or more steps. Likewise, a connection
pad that "comprises," "has," "includes" or "contains" one or more elements possesses those
one or more elements, but is not limited to possessing only those elements. For example, in a
connection pad that comprises a fluid-delivery connection and a pressure-sensor connection,
the connection pad includes the specified elements but is not limited to having only those
elements. For example, such a connection pad could also include a vacuum connection.
[0047]     Further, a device or structure that is configured in a certain way is configured in at
least that way, but it can also be configured in other ways than those specifically described.
[0048]     Referring now to the drawings, and more particularly to FIG. 1, one example of a
negative pressure wound treatment (NPWT) system 10 is shown that can incorporate and/or
comprise embodiments of the present connection pads. In the embodiment shown, system 10
comprises wound dressing 12, conduit 14, and vacuum apparatus 16 coupled to conduit 14
and thereby to wound dressing 12. In the embodiment shown, wound dressing 12 comprises a
foam wound insert 24 (e.g., distribution manifold 24), and a drape 26. Drape 26 is configured
to be coupled to skin of a patient adjacent the wound such that drape 26 covers wound insert
24 and the wound, and forms a space between a wound surface of the wound and drape 26.
Wound insert 24 can comprise any suitable foam, such as, for example, an open-celled foam
(which may also be reticulated), and/or the like. Wound dressing 12 can comprise and/or can
be coupled to conduit 14 by a connection pad 22, as shown. Connection pad 22 is typically
coupled to drape 26 by an adhesive or the like. For example, in some embodiments, drape 26
has a hole or aperture through its center such that drape 26 fits around connection pad 22
(e.g., around a flange of connection pad 22), such that a lower adhesive side of drape 26 can
adhere to connection pad 22 and the skin of the patient adjacent to the wound. In other
embodiments, drape 26 is provided with a hole in its center (e.g., before or after drape 26 is
coupled to the skin of the patient to cover the wound and wound insert 24), and a secondary

                                              - 11
drape is coupled over a portion of connection pad 22 (e.g., a flange of connection pad 22) to
couple the connection pad to drape 26.
[0049]      In the embodiment shown, conduit 14 comprises a multi-lumen tube including one or
more tubing sections 28 which, as an assembled structure, provide a continuous conduit
between connection pad 22 and a container connector 34 positioned on a fluid container 18.
As generally known in the art, liquid and other exudates drawn by NPWT system 10 are
removed from conduit 14 at container connector 34, and deposited in and retained within
container 18. In the embodiment shown, instrumentation tubes 36a and 36b extend from
container connector 34 to instrumentation components 20. In the embodiment shown,
instrumentation components 20 comprise a vacuum source 38 and pressure monitoring
instrument components 40a and 40b (e.g., pressure sensors for measuring pressure), which
are described in more detail in U.S. Pat. App. No. 11/722,802. Each of the instrument
components 20 is individually associated with one of three isolated conduits (tubes or lumens)
that extend from reduced pressure adapter 22 into vacuum apparatus 16.
[0050]      In the embodiment shown, system 10 further comprises a fluid source 50 coupled to
wound dressing 12 by a conduit 54 and a tee- fitting 58. In the embodiment shown, vacuum
apparatus 16 and fluid source 50 are shown separately; however, in some embodiments, fluid
source 50 and vacuum apparatus 16 may be commonly housed. In some embodiments, fitting
58 can provide communication between a multi-lumen conduit 54 and multi-lumen conduit 28.
However, in other embodiments, fitting 58 is configured to enable fluid communication between
the primary lumen of conduit 28 and a single lumen of conduit 54, while permitting
communication between the peripheral lumens of conduit 28 on both sides of fitting 58. In
some embodiments, fitting 58 comprises a switch valve or the like such that communication
can be selectively permitted between wound dressing 12 and fluid source 50, and between
wound dressing 12 and vacuum apparatus 16. In other embodiments, fluid source 50 is
separately coupled to wound insert 12, such as, for example, by way of a separate lumen in
connection pad 22, or by way of a separate connection pad 22. In the embodiments in which
fluid source 50 is separately coupled to wound insert 12, tee fitting 58 may be omitted.
[0051]      In various embodiments of wound insert 12 (e.g., where wound insert 12 is large or
elongated such as for a large wound), multiple connection pads 22 may be used or employed
with (e.g., coupled to) a single wound dressing 12. For example, in some such embodiments, a
first connection pad 22 can be coupled to fluid source 50, and a second connection pad 22 can
be coupled to vacuum apparatus 16, such that fluid can introduced to the wound insert through
the first connection pad, and vacuum or negative pressure (relative to atmospheric pressure)

                                                 - 12
can be applied to the wound insert via the connection pad that is coupled to vacuum apparatus
16 (e.g., such that fluid can travel through a larger portion of wound insert 24 and/or to contact
a greater portion of the wound before being extracted through the second connection pad).
[0052]     Referring now to FIG. 2, an example of a drape 26 is shown. In the embodiment
shown, drape 26 comprises a film 44 (e.g., a polyurethane film) coated one side with a
pressure-sensitive adhesive (e.g., a pressure-sensitive acrylic resin adhesives), and having a
hole 48 extending through film 44. Hole 48 is typically sized to correspond to one or more
corresponding openings in a lower side of connection pad 22 and may be cut or otherwise
formed after a drape is coupled to (e.g., adhered to) a patient. Drape 26 (e.g., film 44) can be
sized such that drape 26 is sufficiently large to extend beyond the borders of a wound to which
wound dressing 12 is applied and such that the adhesive of drape 26 contacts and adheres to
a sufficient portion of the patient's skin adjacent to the wound to provide a substantially sealed
environment between drape 26 and the wound. In other embodiments, drape 26 can comprise
two parts or pieces. For example, drape 26 of FIG. 2 can be cut or have a border along line 52
and the two pieces can be sealed with surgical tape and/or the like placed over line 52.
[0053]     Referring now to FIGS. 3-5, enlarged views are shown of first embodiment 22a of the
present connection pads. In the embodiment shown, connection pad 22a comprises a body
100 having a dressing side 104 and a connection side 108. Dressing side 104 includes a
surface 112 defining a cavity 116 (e.g., a domed cavity) having an upper portion 120 and a
base portion 124. In the embodiment shown, connection pad 22a also includes a flange 128
(e.g., a substantially planar flange) surrounding base portion 124 of cavity 116. In the
embodiment shown, connection side 108 includes a lumen 132 (e.g., a fluid-delivery and/or
vacuum lumen 132) in fluid communication with an upper portion 120 of cavity 116, and
configured to be coupled to a fluid source (e.g., fluid source 50, such as, for example, by way
of conduit 54) and/or a vacuum source. More particularly, lumen 132 is in fluid communication
with upper portion 120 of cavity 116 by way of primary port 136 and open channel 140
disclosed adjacent top portion 120 of cavity 116, as shown. In the embodiment shown,
connection side 108 further includes an annular pressure-sensor lumen 144 in communication
with cavity 116 and configured to be coupled to the one or more pressure sensors of vacuum
apparatus 16 (e.g., tubes 36 and pressure monitoring instrument components 40a and 40b).
Particularly, in the embodiment shown, annular pressure-sensor lumen 144 is in
communication with cavity 116 by way of ancillary lumen interfaces 148, 152 which are in
communication with pressure-sensor lumens 156 and 160, respectively, and thereby in
communication with cavity 116. In other embodiments, body 100 may not include annular
pressure-sensor lumen 144 (e.g., first pressure-sensor lumen 156 can extend to the

                                               - 13
connection side to be coupled to a pressure sensor). Further, in other embodiments, second
pressure-sensor lumen 160 may be omitted. In the embodiment shown, annular pressure
sensor lumen 144 is disposed around lumen 132 (e.g., such that annular pressure-sensor
lumen 144 is concentric with lumen 132). In the embodiment shown, surface 112 defining
cavity 116 includes open channel 140 extending into upper portion 120 of cavity 116, and open
channel 140 is coupled to and in communication with lumen 132 via port 136. More
particularly, in the embodiment shown, open channel 140 is disposed at the apex of cavity 116.
[0054]     In the embodiment shown, a first portion 164 of surface 112 on a first side of open
channel 140, as shown, includes a plurality of grooves 168 extending from open channel 140
to base portion 124 of cavity 116. Grooves 168 are configured to direct fluid from and/or to
open channel 140, port 136, and fluid lumen 132. In the embodiment shown, a second portion
172 on a second side of open channel 140 defines a shelf 172 that is substantially parallel to
(and/or co-planar with) planar flange 128. As shown, shelf 172 also comprises a plurality of
serrations or grooves 176. Grooves 176 are also configured to direct fluid to or from open
channel 140, and/or away from lumens 156 and 160, such that as fluid is delivered and/or
removed from cavity 116 and/or wound dressing 12, fluid is generally directed past lumens 156
and 160 such that lumens 156 and 160 remain substantially unobstructed to permit vacuum
apparatus 16 to sense the pressure or negative pressure within cavity 116 and/or wound
dressing 12.
[0055]     In the embodiment shown, fluid lumen 132 is not in fluid communication with lumens
156, 160 through body 100. In particular, although lumens 156, 160 may be permitted to
communicate fluidly with lumen 132 (e.g., port 136) within and through cavity 116, within the
solid portion of body 100 lumens 156, 160 are separate and distinct from fluid lumen 132 and
port 136. In this way, vacuum apparatus 16 is permitted to sense pressure or negative
pressure within open cavity 116 and/or wound dressing 12 separately from (e.g., not entirely
dependent on) fluid and/or negative pressure in lumen 132. Additionally, in the embodiment
shown, a lateral portion of each pressure-sensor lumen 156, 160 is open into cavity 116. More
particularly, in the embodiment shown, body 100 defines notches 180 and 182 extending from
a lateral portion of lumen 156 into cavity 116, and body 100 defines notches 184 and 186
extending from a lateral portion of lumen 160 into cavity 116. Notches 180, 182, 184, and 186
are configured to improve communication between lumens 156, 160 and cavity 116, so as to
improve the ability of vacuum apparatus 16 to sense and/or monitor pressure or negative
pressure at the wound (e.g., in cavity 116 and/or in wound dressing 12), especially, for
example, where opening 48 in drape 26 is small, roughly cut, not fully made, off center, and/or

                                                   - 14
is otherwise not optimally formed such that drape 26 would otherwise interfere and/or partially
block the lumens 156, 160.
[0056]      In the embodiment shown, body 100 also defines a lower end of each pressure
sensor lumen 156 and 160 that is substantially even with shelf 172. In the embodiment shown,
at the lower end of each lumen 156 and 160, each lumen 156 and 160 extends into cavity 116
at an angle that is substantially perpendicular to open channel 140 (e.g., a longitudinal axis of
open channel 140. In some embodiments, the lower end of each pressure-sensor lumen 156,
160 is offset from flange 128 (e.g., stops a distance short of the lower surface of the flange
128), such as, for example, by a distance of equal to, greater than, less than, or between any
of, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1 mm). In the embodiments where the lower end of
each lumen 156, 160 is even with the lower surface of flange 128, body 100 is configured such
that the lower end of each lumen 156, 160 is adjacent to and/or abuts wound insert 24 when
connection pad 22a is coupled to wound dressing 12 (e.g., wound insert 24). In this way, body
100 is configured such that fluid being delivered to and/or drawn into cavity 116 is largely
directed past lumens 156, 160 such that the fluid does not interfere with the pressure sensing
functionality of the lumens 156 and 160, and notches 180, 182, 184, 186 still permit lumens
156, 160 to communicate with cavity 116 and/or wound dressing 12 to sense pressure or
negative pressure within cavity 116 and/or wound dressing 12.
[0057]     Additionally, as shown in FIG. 3 but omitted from FIGS. 4 and 5, some embodiments
of connection pads 22a further comprise a ring of adhesive 190 (shown in partial cross
section) coupled to flange 128 of body 100. In particular, in the embodiment shown, flange
portion 128 of body 100 comprises a lower side 194 configured to face wound dressing 12 if
connection pad 22a is coupled to wound dressing 12. Adhesive ring 190 can comprise any
suitable adhesive, such as, for example, an adhesive comprising hydrogel, hydrocolloids, a
pressure-sensitive adhesive, and/or any other suitable adhesive. In this embodiment, adhesive
ring 190 is configured such that if connection pad 22a is coupled to wound dressing 12 can
adhere to wound insert 24. In other embodiments, adhesive ring 190 (or a second adhesive
ring) can be coupled to an upper side of flange portion 128 (e.g., a side opposite lower side
194) to adhere to a drape 26 placed over the wound insert 24. In some embodiments, the
adhesive can be removable and/or re-applicable such that even after initially adhering to a
portion of dressing, the position of connection pad 22a relative to wound dressing 12 can be
adjusted as needed or desired. In other embodiments, connection pad 22a can be
permanently coupled (e.g., during manufacture) to drape 26 prior to receipt by a user (e.g.,
doctor, nurse, etc.) by any suitable means, such as, for example, radio-frequency (RF)
welding, ultrasonic welding, and/or the like.

                                               -15
[0058]     Referring now to FIG. 6, an alternative embodiment 22b is shown that is substantially
similar to connection pad 22a, with the primary exception that connection pad 22b (e.g., in
addition to port 136 and open channel 140) comprises a fluid-delivery lumen 232 and fluid
delivery ring 234 disposed around cavity 216 (e.g., around the perimeter of base portion 224
and/or cavity 216), where fluid-delivery lumen 232 is in communication with fluid-delivery ring
234. In this embodiment, fluid delivery ring 234 is configured to permit fluid to be delivered
around cavity 216 (e.g., such that a fluid can be delivered from fluid source 50 via fluid lumen
232) and will disperse through at least a portion of (e.g., up to all of) fluid delivery ring 234
such that the fluid will be dispersed around wound insert 24.
[0059]     Referring now to FIGS. 7A-8B, shown there is another embodiment of a connection
pad 22c. FIGS. 7A and 8A depict upper and lower perspective views of connection pad 22c.
As described in more detail below, FIGS. 7B and 8B depict alternate configurations for various
features of connection pad 22c. Connection pad 22c is similar in some respects to connection
pads 22a and 22b, as described in more detail here. In the embodiment shown, connection
pad 22c comprises a body 300 and a dressing side 304 and a connection side 308. Dressing
side 304 includes a surface 312 defining a cavity 316 (e.g., a domed cavity) having an upper
portion 320 and a base portion 324. In the embodiment shown, body 300 also includes a
flange 328 (e.g., a substantially planar flange) surrounding base portion 324 of cavity 316. In
the embodiment shown, connection side 308 includes a single-lumen fluid delivery connection
332 configured to be coupled to a fluid source (e.g., fluid source 50), and having a lumen 334
extending into cavity 316. In the embodiment shown, connection side 308 also includes a
multi-lumen vacuum and pressure-sensor connection 336 configured to be coupled in vacuum
apparatus 16). Connection 336 has a vacuum lumen 340 terminating at upper portion 320 of
cavity 316, and an annular pressure-sensor lumen 344 disposed around vacuum lumen 340. In
a manner similar to that described above for lumens 156, 160 and lumen 132 for connection
pad 22a, annular pressure-sensor lumen 344 is not in fluid communication with vacuum lumen
340 through body 300.
[0060]     FIG. 7B depicts an alternate configuration 22c-I for connection pad 22c. In particular,
connection 332 includes a larger lumen 334a (and/or body 300 is configured such that the
sidewall that defines lumen 334a is thinner than in connection pad 22c); connection 336
includes a larger lumen 344a (and/or body 300 is formed such that the sidewall that defines
lumen 344a is smaller than in connection pad 22c); connection 336 is configured such that
lumen 340a terminates within lumen 344a (e.g., such that the end of lumen 340a terminates
inside of, or short of, the end of lumen 344a, as shown); and body 300a includes a plurality of

                                                - 16
cutouts 346 between lumen 334a and lumen 344a (e.g., to improve ease of manufacture, such
as by injection or other molding or casting).
[0061]     In the embodiment shown, body 300 defines two pressure-sensor lumens 348, 350
each having a lower end, as shown, extending into cavity 316, and each in fluid
communication with annular pressure-sensor lumen 344. Additionally, in the embodiment
shown, a lateral portion of each pressure-sensor lumen 348, 350 is open to cavity 316. More
particularly, in the embodiment shown, body 300 defines notches 352, 354, extending between
lateral portions of lumens 348 and 350, respectively. In the embodiment shown, notches 352,
354 are substantially rectangular. In other configurations, notches 352, 354 can have any
suitable shape (e.g., angled, arcuate notches 352a, 354a, as shown in FIG. 8B). As described
above for notches 180, 182, 184, and 186 of connection pad 22a, notches 352, 354 are
configured to improve communication between lumens 348, 350 and cavity 316, so as to
improve the ability of vacuum apparatus 16 to sense and/or monitor pressure or negative
pressure at the wound (e.g., in cavity 316 and/or in wound dressing 12), especially, for
example, where opening 48 in drape 26 is small, roughly cut, not fully made, off center, and/or
is otherwise not optimally formed such that drape 26 might otherwise (in the absence of
notches 352, 354) interfere and/or partially block the lumens 348 and 350. In other
embodiments, body 300 may define more than two pressure centered lumens, and/or notches
352, 354 may be provided with any suitable shape (e.g., such as square or rectangular
notches 180, 182 of connection pad 22a). In other embodiments, body 300 may define
circumferential castellations around the bottom end of lumens 348 and 350.
[0062]     In the embodiment shown, connection pad 22c is configured as a vacuum and fluid
delivery connection pad with relatively simple connections to a fluid source and a vacuum
apparatus, such that fluid may be delivered, negative pressure may be applied, and/or
pressure or negative pressure may be sensed by way of the same connection pad 22c. In the
embodiment shown, the lower end of fluid-delivery lumen 334 is configured to have a
substantially square end (e.g., does not have a lateral portion open to cavity 316). In this way,
the lower end of fluid-delivery lumen 334 is configured to substantially abut wound insert 24 if
connection pad 22c is coupled to wound insert 12, such that if fluid is delivered through fluid
delivery lumen 334, such fluid is delivered primarily directly into wound insert 24 rather than
into cavity 316. In this way, fluid delivered by way of fluid-delivery lumen 334 is dispersed into
wound insert 24 such that the fluid or at least some portion of the fluid will reach the wound
(e.g., a surface of the wound) to irrigate or deliver medication to the wound, and will be
subsequently drawn back through wound insert 24 and guided through cavity 316 to vacuum
lumen 344.

                                                - 17
[0063]     Similarly to connection pad 22a, body 300 (e.g., surface 312) of connection pad 22c
defines a plurality of grooves 356 extending radially outward from the apex of cavity 316 to
base portion 324 of cavity 316. In this embodiment, grooves 356 are configured to guide fluid
entering cavity 316 past fluid-delivery lumen 334 and pressure-sensor lumens 348 and 350 to
vacuum lumen 344. In this way, grooves 356 assist in preventing and/or reducing fluid and/or
exudates from interfering with or blocking pressure-sensor lumens 348, 350 and/or fluid
delivery lumen 334. Body 300 does not include a shelf (such as shelf 172 of connection pad
22a); however, in other embodiments, body 300 may include a shelf.
[0064]     In the embodiment shown, a lower side 360 of flange portion 328 includes a plurality
of features configured to guide fluids from radially outer portions of flange 320 into cavity 316
(e.g., such as when vacuum is applied through vacuum lumen 344). For example, in the
embodiment shown lower side 360 includes a plurality of radial grooves, and two circular paths
of arcuate grooves, each path including a plurality of arcuate grooves concentric with the cavity
(e.g., a plurality of distinct arcuate grooves each lying on one of two circular paths disposed
concentrically around the cavity). More particularly, in the embodiment shown, lower side 360
of flange 328 includes a plurality of radial serrated guide channels 364, a plurality of arcuate
perimeter collection channels 368, and a plurality of arcuate intermediate collection channels
372. In the embodiment shown, each serrated guide channel 364 extends radially outward
from cavity 316 to a corresponding arcuate perimeter collection channels 368 at a point
internal to the outer perimeter of flange portion 328. In the embodiment shown, each serrated
guide channel 364 is deepest at its center and is shallower at its lateral edges. More
particularly, each serrated guide channel 364 comprises a central groove or serration having a
depth, and a plurality of peripheral grooves or serrations adjacent the central groove or
serration, and each peripheral groove or serration has a depth that is less than the depth of the
central groove (e.g., having depths that are sequentially less as the distance between the
peripheral groove and the central groove increases).
[0065]     In the embodiment shown, each arcuate perimeter collection channel 368 extends
from a distal (relative to cavity 316) end of a corresponding serrated guide channel 364 in a
clockwise direction from the corresponding serrated guide channel 368, and terminates before
reaching the next adjacent serrated guide channel 364, as shown. In the embodiment shown,
arcuate perimeter collection channels 368 are concentric with cavity 316. Each arcuate
intermediate collection channel 372 extends from the center of a corresponding serrated guide
channel 368 in a counterclockwise direction from the corresponding serrated guide channel
368, and terminates before reaching the next adjacent serrated guide channel 368, as shown.
In the embodiment shown, arcuate intermediate collection channels 372 are concentric with

                                                -18
cavity 316, and concentric with arcuate perimeter collection channels 368. Serrated guide
channels 364, arcuate intermediate collection channels 372, and arcuate perimeter collection
channels 368 are configured to cooperate to guide fluid from the periphery of flange 328 to
cavity 316 in the manner indicated by arrows 376 and 378. In other embodiments, arcuate
perimeter collection channels 368 and/or arcuate intermediate collection channels 372 can be
provided in any suitable number and/or direction.
[0066]     In the embodiment shown, connection pad 22c is configured such that the lower side
of flange portion 328 is configured to face wound dressing 12 (e.g., wound insert 24) if
connection pad 22c is coupled to wound dressing 12. In some embodiments, connection pad
22c comprises and/or is provided with a ring of adhesive (not shown) such as described above
for connection pad 22a (e.g., coupled to an upper side of flange portion 328 and/or coupled to
a peripheral portion of the lower side of flange portion 328).
[0067]     Referring now to FIGS. 9 and 10, another embodiment 22d is shown of one of the
present connection pads. Connection pad 22d is similar in some respect to connection pads
22a, 22b, and 22c, as described here. In the embodiment shown, connection pad 22d
comprises a body 400 having a dressing side 404 and a connection side 408. Dressing side
404 includes a surface 412 defining a cavity 416 (e.g., a domed cavity) having an upper
portion 420 and a base portion 424. In the embodiment shown, body 400 also includes a
flange 428 (e.g., a substantially planar flange) surrounding base portion 424 of cavity 416.
Connection side 408 includes a fluid delivery connection 432 having a fluid-delivery lumen 436
in fluid communication with upper portion 420 of cavity 416, and configured to be coupled to a
fluid source (e.g., fluid source 50). Additionally, in the embodiment shown, surface 412 defining
cavity 416 includes a plurality of grooves 440 extending from upper portion 420 of cavity 416 to
base portion 424 of cavity 416.
[0068]     In the embodiment shown, cavity 416 does not include a shelf (e.g., shelf 172 of
connection pad 22a), such that the entirety of cavity 416 is domed in an arcuate circular
configuration (e.g., a hemispherical configuration). As such, in the embodiment shown, fluid
delivery lumen 436 extends to upper portion 420 of cavity 416, and grooves 440 extend
radially outward along surface 412 from fluid-delivery lumen 436 to base portion 424 of cavity
416. In the embodiment shown, a lower surface 444 of flange 428 includes serrated guide
channels 448, arcuate perimeter collection channels 452, arcuate intermediate collection
channels 456, which are substantially similar to serrated guide channels 364, arcuate
perimeter collection channels 368, and arcuate intermediate collection channels 372 of
connection pad 22c, described above.

                                                  -19
[0069]       In the embodiment shown, connection pad 22d is configured for fluid delivery such
that connection pad 22d can be coupled to a fluid source (e.g. fluid source 50) and to wound
dressing 12, such that a separate connection pad can also be separately coupled to wound
dressing 12 and to a vacuum source (e.g., vacuum apparatus 16), to separately apply vacuum
to wound dressing 12. In this way, distance between fluid delivery connection pad 22d in a
vacuum connection can be maximized such that fluid delivered through connection pad 22d is
more likely to travel through wound insert 24 and to the wound surface before being extracted
through the vacuum connection pad. As such, connection pad 22d may also be characterized
or described as a fluid instillation connection pad 22d.
[0070]       Referring now to FIGS. 11 and 12 A, another embodiment 22e of the present
connection pads is shown. Connection pad 22e is similar in some respect to connection pads
22a, 22b, 22c, and 22d, as described here. In the embodiment shown, connection pad 22e
comprises a body 500 having a dressing side 504 and a connection side 508. Dressing side
504 includes a surface 512 defining a cavity 516 (e.g., a domed cavity) having an upper
portion 520 and a base portion 524. In the embodiment shown, body 500 also includes a
flange 528 (e.g., a substantially planar flange) surrounding base portion 524 of cavity 516.
Connection side 508 includes a fluid delivery connection 532 having a fluid-delivery lumen 536
in fluid communication with upper portion 520 of cavity 516, and configured to be coupled to a
fluid source (e.g., fluid source 50). In the embodiment shown, body 500 is configured such that
delivery connection 532 does not extend beyond the perimeter of dome 538. In this way, a
drape (e.g., 26) can be configured to have an opening (e.g., 48) having a diameter that is
substantially equal to were slightly larger than the perimeter of dome 538 such that wound
insert 24 can be placed on or in a wound of a patient, connection pad 22e can be placed in
contact with wound insert 24, and a drape with an appropriately sized hole can be placed over
connection pad 22e (e.g., body 500) such that dome 538 extends through the opening in the
drape in the drape can be adhered to flange portion 528 with relative ease and/or relatively
little wrinkling or modification. In certain the embodiments, any of other connection pads 22a,
22b, 22c, 22d can be configured in similar fashion such that the various connections on their
respective connection side did not extend beyond the perimeter of the domed portions on their
respective upper sides (e.g., corresponding to their respective domed cavities).
[0071]       In the embodiment shown, surface 512 defining cavity 516 includes a plurality of
grooves 540 extending from upper portion 520 of cavity 516 to base portion 524 of cavity 516.
Additionally, in the embodiment shown, base portion 524 of cavity 516 has a lower peripheral
edge 544 with a saw-toothed configuration, as shown. In the embodiment of FIG. 12, the saw
toothed configuration of edge 544 is formed by the intersection of a chamfer between grooves

                                                - 20
544 and lower surface 548 of flange 528. In the configuration shown in the upper inset of FIG.
12B, the chamfer is omitted such that the saw-toothed configuration is provided by the
intersection of grooves 540 and lower surface 548 of flange 528. In the embodiment shown,
lower surface 548 is substantially smooth and substantially planar, as shown. In this way, and
as particularly suited for fluid delivery connection pads, substantially smooth planar lower
surface 548 can be coated with and/or coupled to an adhesive such that substantially all of
lower surface 548 can be coupled to wound insert 12 (e.g. to wound insert 24) to provide
adhesion between lower surface 548 and wound dressing 12 (e.g., wound insert 24 and/or
drape 26) to provide a connection that is durable in the presence of liquid (e.g., resistance to
degradation in the presence of liquids such as water or the like). As also shown, fluid-delivery
lumen 536 extends laterally into cavity 516 between upper portion 520 and base portion 524.
Additionally, in the embodiment shown, fluid-delivery lumen 536 includes an open-end 552
facing (e.g., directed toward) a side of cavity 516.
[0072]     In other embodiments, such as is shown in the lower inset of FIG. 12B, a lateral
portion of fluid-delivery lumen 536 opens downward toward base portion 524 of cavity 516.
More particularly, and the embodiment shown, body 500 defines an aperture 556 opening
downward into cavity 516 toward base portion 524. Additionally, in the embodiment shown in
the lower inset of FIG. 12B, the end 560 of fluid-delivery lumen 536 is closed such that fluid
delivery lumen 536 is only in fluid communication with cavity 516 through downward opening
or aperture 556 from fluid-delivery lumen 536. Similarly to connection pads 22a, 22b, 22c, and
22d; connection pad 22e can be provided with a ring of adhesive (not shown) either or both of
an upper or lower side of flange 528, such that flange 528 can be configured to be coupled to
wound dressing 12 (e.g., to wound insert 24). The embodiment shown, flange portion 528 of
body 500 is configured such that lower surface or side 548 faces wound dressing 12 (e.g.,
wound insert 24) such as where an adhesive is coupled to lower surface 548 of flange 528.
[0073]     FIG. 12C depicts another embodiment that is substantially similar to the embodiment
of FIG. 12A, but in which cavity 516 does not include grooves, and instead includes a
substantially smooth interior surface 556.
[0074]     Referring now to FIG. 13, one of the present connection pads 22 is shown coupled to
a wound dressing 12a. For clarity, wound dressing 12a is shown in cross-section. More
particularly, in the embodiment shown, wound dressing 12a comprises: a wound insert 24
(e.g., adjacent a wound or wound surface of a patient); a drape 26a (e.g., coupled to skin
adjacent the wound) such that drape 26a covers the wound and wound insert 24 and forms a
space between the wound and drape 26a. Additionally in the configuration shown, wound

                                               - 21
dressing 12a further comprises a secondary drape 28 coupling connection pad 22 to drape 26.
In the embodiment shown, drape 26a is substantially similar to drape 26 of FIG. 2, but includes
a user-made hole 48a. That is, when a user such as a nurse or doctor opens drape 26a for use
(e.g., from a package), the user must cut drape 26a to form hole 48a. In such embodiments
hole 48a may be smaller than desired, smaller than optimally effective, and/or may be jagged
or irregular such that flaps of drape 26a may interfere with pressure-sensor lumens of
previously known connection pads. As such, embodiments of the present connection pads
(e.g. 22a, 22c) are configured for improved functionality where such connection pads are
coupled to wound dressings in a configuration such as is shown in FIG. 13. For example, and
as noted above, body 100 of connection pad 22a has lateral portions of the pressure-sensor
lumens 156 and 160 (e.g., by way of notches 180, 182, 184, 186) open into or in
communication with cavity 116 to enable improved pressure- sensor functionality where
connection pad 22a is coupled to a wound dressing in a configuration such as is shown in FIG.
13 (e.g., between a first drape and a second drape such that the connection pad is not in direct
contact with the wound insert).
[0075]      Some embodiments of the present wound-treatment methods comprise: coupling a
wound dressing (e.g., wound dressing 12) to a patient; coupling one or more of any of the
present connection pads to the wound addressing; delivering a fluid to the wound dressing
(e.g. to a wound covered by the wound dressing); applying a vacuum to the wound dressing
(e.g., to a wound covered by the wound dressing); and/or sensing a pressure or negative
pressure in the wound dressing (e.g., at a wound covered by the wound dressing), such as, for
example, while delivering a fluid to the wound dressing and/or while applying a vacuum to the
wound dressing; backspace. In any of the embodiments of the present wound-treatment
methods, coupling a wound dressing to a patient can comprise: disposing a wound insert
adjacent to a wound of a patient (e.g., on a wound surface of the wound); and/or coupling a
drape to skin of the patient adjacent to the wound such that the drape covers the wound insert
in the wound and forms a space between the wound and the drape. In any of the embodiments
of the present wound-treatment methods, coupling one or more of any of the present
connection pads to the wound dressing can comprise coupling the connection pad to the
wound insert (e.g., before or after coupling the drape to the skin of the patient); and/or coupling
the drape to the connection pad (e.g., before or after coupling the drape to the skin of the
patient). In any embodiments of the present wound-treatment methods, delivering a fluid to the
wound dressing can comprise activating a fluid source (e.g., fluid source 50) to deliver a fluid
to the wound dressing. In any of the embodiments of the present wound-treatment methods,
applying a vacuum to the wound dressing can comprise activating a vacuum source (e.g.
vacuum apparatus 16) to apply a vacuum or negative pressure to the wound dressing in any of

                                                 - 22
the embodiments of the present wound-treatment methods, possessing a pressure or negative
pressure in the wound dressing can comprise activating one or more pressure censors or
pressure-sensor elements (e.g., pressure-sensor elements 40a, 40b) to sense a pressure or
negative pressure in wound dressing 12 (e.g., in the space formed between the wound in the
drape).
[0076]      Referring now to FIGS. 14 and 15, an additional embodiment of a wound dressing
12b is shown. In the embodiment shown, wound dressing 12b comprises a drape 26b and the
wound insert 24. More particularly, in the embodiment shown, wound insert 12b is shown in a
coupled configuration such that wound insert 24 is adjacent a wound of a patient (e.g., is
adjacent a wound surface of the wound) and drape 26b is coupled to skin (not shown) adjacent
the wound. As shown, drape 26b has not been breached (e.g., does not have a hole such as
hole 48 of drape 26). In this way, wound insert 24 can be placed adjacent the wound, and
drape 26b can be coupled to skin adjacent a wound to cover the wound and the wound insert
24 such that the wound insert and the wound are substantially sealed by drape 26b, as shown
in FIG. 14. In the embodiment shown, connection pad 22 is coupled to drape 26b by way of
adhesive between a lower side of the flange portion of connection pad 22 and drape 26b, and
after connection pad 22 is coupled to drape 26b and drape 26b is breached to create a hole
48b, as shown in FIG. 15. In some embodiments, wound insert 12b can comprise a secondary
drape 28 (e.g., similar to secondary drape 28 of FIG. 13) to couple connection pad 22 to
wound dressing 12b.
[0077]      In accordance with the configuration depicted in FIGS. 14 and 15, embodiments of
the present methods of coupling a wound dressing to a patient comprise: disposing a wound
insert (e.g., wound insert 24) adjacent to a wound of a patient (e.g., adjacent to and/or in
contact with a surface of the wound); coupling a drape (e.g., drape 26b) to skin of the patient
adjacent the wound such that the drape covers the wound insert and the wound and defines a
space (e.g., a space that is at least partially and/or entirely open); coupling a connection pad
(e.g., connection pad 22, 22a, 22b, 22c, 22d, 22e) to the drape, where the fluid delivery pad is
configured to be coupled to a fluid source (e.g., fluid source 50) such that the fluid source can
deliver fluid to the connection pad. In some embodiments the drape is configured to comprise
a substantially solid sheet (e.g., a sheet without a hole such as hole 48). In some embodiments
of the present methods of coupling a wound dressing to a patient comprise breaching the
drape, after coupling section pad to the drape fluid communication between the wound
dressing (e.g., the space between the wound surface and the drape).

                                                 - 23
[0078]     In some embodiments, breaching the drape comprises delivering (e.g., from a fluid
source, such as a fluid pump or syringe, through a conduit coupled to the connection pad)
through the connection pad a solvent to the drape, where the solvent is configured to dissolve
a portion of the drape (e.g., dissolves a portion of the drape sufficient to create a hole 48b) to
permit fluid communication between the space and the connection pad (e.g. between a fluid
source coupled to the connection pad and the space between the drape and the wound
surface. For example, currently available drapes often comprise polyurethane, which is
generally dissolvable in or with solvents that comprise ketones. As such, suitable solvents may
comprise ketones (e.g., propanone) and/or other solvents or components that are soluble in
water (or other embodiments, insoluble in water). In such embodiments, to prevent the solvent
from dissolving the fluid delivery conduit (e.g., 54) end of the connection pad, they conduit and
the connection pad can comprise a material that is not soluble in the presence of the solvent
used. For example, in the embodiments in which the solvent comprises a ketone, the fluid
delivery conduit and the connection pad can comprise suitably insoluble polymers (e.g. and
soluble in the presence of the solvent used), such as, for example, thermoplastic elastomers.
By way of another example, the fluid delivery conduit may have a liner co-extruded or co
molded into the interior of the conduit, such that the liner is insoluble in the presence of the
solvent used and thereby protects the conduit. Similarly, wound insert 24 should comprise a
material that is at least substantially insoluble in the presence of the solvent, such that
introduction of the solvent to the drape and breaching of the drape by the solvent does not
substantially degrade the foam of wound insert 24.
[0079]     Alternatively, the drape can comprise a polymer or other material soluble in a less
aggressive solvent, such that commonly available connection pads and conduits may be used.
For example drape can comprise a vinyl acetate copolymer configured to be soluble in various
alcohols, such as, for example, ethanol and the like. By way of another example, the drape can
comprise a polymer with free acid groups attached (e.g., acrylics and the like) configured to be
soluble in water with high pH levels, such that, for example, the solvent can comprise water
comprising salts (e.g., carbonates), amines (e.g., urea, or ethanolamine), and or the like such
that the water is configured to have a high pH level (e.g., equal to, greater than, less than, or
between any of, 7, 8, 9, 10, 1 1 , 12, 13, 14).
[0080]     In the embodiment shown in FIGS. 14 and 15, connection pad 22 comprises a
dressing side with the cavity, as is described above for the various embodiments of the present
connection pads. Some embodiments of the present methods comprise disposing a container
(e.g., such as a balloon, envelope, or the like) of a first solvent between the connection pad
and the drape (e.g. within a cavity of the connection pad), where the first solvent is configured

                                                - 24
to dissolve a portion of the drape, and where the container is configured to dissolve in the
presence of a second solvent. In such embodiments of the present methods, breaching the
drape can comprise delivering the second solvent to the container (e.g. through the connection
pad and/or from a fluid source such as fluid source 50) such that the container dissolves to
release the first solvent and the first solvent dissolves a portion of the drape (e.g., dissolves a
portion of the drape sufficient to create a hole 48b).
[0081]      Some embodiments of the present methods further comprise: delivering a fluid to the
wound dressing through the connection pad, and/or applying a vacuum to the wound dressing
(e.g., after delivering a fluid to the wound dressing, such as through the connection pad
through which fluid is delivered and/or another connection pad), to flush away debris from hole
48b (e.g., dissolve drape material) and/or to flush away remaining solvent such that dissolution
of the drape is halted or stopped after a predetermined amount of time or after hole 48b
reaches a desired or predetermined sized. For example, such a fluid can comprise an inert
fluid, such as, for example, water, saline solution, and/or the like.
[0082]      Embodiments of the present methods in which the drape is breached after a
connection pad is coupled to the drape are configured to prevent and/or produce user error
and difficulty associated with requiring a user to create a hole in the drape. For example,
breaching the drape in the ways described in the present methods automatically creates the
hole in the drape and position corresponding with the appropriate lumens of the connection
pad (e.g. corresponding to a cavity of the connection pad), and thereby can improve
performance, reliability, and repeatedly of the various wound-treatment methods including the
present wound dressings and connection pads.
[0083]      Embodiments of the present drapes, connection pads, and the like are configured to
have the features described in this disclosure (e.g., for the present methods).
