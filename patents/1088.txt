    THERAPEUTICALLY ACTIVE COMPOUNDS AND THEIR METHODS OF USE
                                      CLAIM OF PRIORITY
        This application claims priority from U.S.S.N. 61/584,214, filed January 6, 2012 which is
incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
                                BACKGROUND OF INVENTION
        Isocitrate dehydrogenases (IDHs) catalyze the oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate to
2-oxoglutarate (i.e., a-ketoglutarate). These enzymes belong to two distinct subclasses, one of
which utilizes NAD(+) as the electron acceptor and the other NADP(+). Five isocitrate
dehydrogenases have been reported: three NAD(+)-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenases, which
localize to the mitochondrial matrix, and two NADP(+)-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenases,
one of which is mitochondrial and the other predominantly cytosolic. Each NADP(+)-dependent
isozyme is a homodimer.
        IDH2 (isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (NADP+), mitochondrial) is also known as IDH; IDP;
IDHM; IDPM; ICD-M; or mNADP-IDH. The protein encoded by this gene is the
NADP(+)-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase found in the mitochondria. It plays a role in
intermediary metabolism and energy production. This protein may tightly associate or interact
with the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. Human IDH2 gene encodes a protein of 452 amino
acids. The nucleotide and amino acid sequences for IDH2 can be found as GenBank entries
NM_002168.2 and NP_002159.2 respectively. The nucleotide and amino acid sequence for
human IDH2 are also described in, e.g., Huh et al., Submitted (NOV-1992) to the
EMBL/GenBank/DDBJ databases; and The MGC Project Team, Genome Res.
14:2121-2127(2004).
        Non-mutant, e.g., wild type, IDH2 catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate to
a-ketoglutarate (a-KG) thereby reducing NAD* (NADP*) to NADH (NADPH), e.g., in the
forward reaction:
        Isocitrate + NAD* (NADP) -+ a-KG + CO2 + NADH (NADPH) + H'.
        It has been discovered that mutations of IDH2 present in certain cancer cells result in a
new ability of the enzyme to catalyze the NADPH-dependent reduction of a-ketoglutarate to
                                                  1

R(-)-2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG). 2HG is not formed by wild-type IDH2. The production of
2HG is believed to contribute to the formation and progression of cancer (Dang, L et al, Nature
2009, 462:739-44).
        The inhibition of mutant IDH2 and its neoactivity is therefore a potential therapeutic
treatment for cancer. Accordingly, there is an ongoing need for inhibitors of IDH2 mutants
having alpha hydroxyl neoactivity.

When the compositions of one aspect of this invention comprise a combination of a compound of
the formulae described herein and one or more additional therapeutic or prophylactic agents,
both the compound and the additional agent should be present at dosage levels of between about
1 to 100%, and more preferably between about 5 to 95% of the dosage normally administered in
a monotherapy regimen. The additional agents may be administered separately, as part of a
multiple dose regimen, from the compounds of one aspect of this invention. Alternatively, those
agents may be part of a single dosage form, mixed together with the compounds of one aspect of
this invention in a single composition.
         The compounds described herein can, for example, be administered by injection,
intravenously, intraarterially, subdermally, intraperitoneally, intramuscularly, or subcutaneously;
or orally, buccally, nasally, transmucosally, topically, in an ophthalmic preparation, or by
inhalation, with a dosage ranging from about 0.5 to about 100 mg/kg of body weight,
alternatively dosages between 1 mg and 1000 mg/dose, every 4 to 120 hours, or according to the
requirements of the particular drug. The methods herein contemplate administration of an
effective amount of compound or compound composition to achieve the desired or stated effect.
Typically, the pharmaceutical compositions of one aspect of this invention will be administered
from about 1 to about 6 times per day or alternatively, as a continuous infusion. Such
administration can be used as a chronic or acute therapy. The amount of active ingredient that
may be combined with the carrier materials to produce a single dosage form will vary depending
upon the host treated and the particular mode of administration. A typical preparation will
contain from about 5% to about 95% active compound (w/w). Alternatively, such preparations
contain from about 20% to about 80% active compound.
         Lower or higher doses than those recited above may be required. Specific dosage and
treatment regimens for any particular subject will depend upon a variety of factors, including the
activity of the specific compound employed, the age, body weight, general health status, sex,
diet, time of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination, the severity and course of the

        Upon improvement of a subject's condition, a maintenance dose of a compound,
composition or combination of one aspect of this invention may be administered, if necessary.
Subsequently, the dosage or frequency of administration, or both, may be reduced, as a function
of the symptoms, to a level at which the improved condition is retained when the symptoms have
been alleviated to the desired level. Subjects may, however, require intermittent treatment on a
long-term basis upon any recurrence of disease symptoms.
        The pharmaceutical compositions described above comprising a compound of Structural
Formula I or II or a compound described in any one of the embodiments herein, may further
comprise another therapeutic agent useful for treating cancer.
Methods of Use
        The inhibitory activities of the compounds provided herein against IDH2 mutants (e.g.,
IDH2R140Q and IDH2R172K) can be tested by methods described in Example 12 or analogous
methods.
        Provided is a method for inhibiting a mutant IDH2 activity comprising contacting a
subject in need thereof with a compound of Structural Formula I or II, a compound described in
any one of the embodiments herein, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. In one

IDH2 mutation results in a new ability of the enzyme to catalyze the NADPH-dependent
reduction of a-ketoglutarate to R(-)-2-hydroxyglutarate in a subject. In one aspect of this
embodiment, the mutant IDH2 has an R140X mutation. In another aspect of this embodiment,
the R140X mutation is a R140Q mutation. In another aspect of this embodiment, the R140X
mutation is a R140W mutation. In another aspect of this embodiment, the R140X mutation is a
R140L mutation. In another aspect of this embodiment, the mutant IDH2 has an R172X
mutation. In another aspect of this embodiment, the R172X mutation is a R172K mutation. In
another aspect of this embodiment, the R172X mutation is a R172G mutation.
        Also provided are methods of treating a cancer characterized by the presence of a mutant
allele of IDH2 comprising the step of administering to subject in need thereof (a) a compound of
Structural Formula I or II, a compound described in any one of the embodiments herein, or a

         In one embodiment, the cancer to be treated is characterized by a mutant allele of IDH2
wherein the IDH2 mutation results in a new ability of the enzyme to catalyze the
NADPH-dependent reduction of a-ketoglutarate to R(-)-2-hydroxyglutarate in a patient. In one
aspect of this embodiment, the mutant IDH2 has an R140X mutation. In another aspect of this
embodiment, the R140X mutation is a R140Q mutation. In another aspect of this embodiment,
the R140X mutation is a R140W mutation. In another aspect of this embodiment, the R140X
mutation is a R140L mutation. In another aspect of this embodiment, the mutant IDH2 has an
R172X mutation. In another aspect of this embodiment, the R172X mutation is a R172K
mutation. In another aspect of this embodiment, the R172X mutation is a R172G mutation. A
cancer can be analyzed by sequencing cell samples to determine the presence and specific nature
of (e.g., the changed amino acid present at) a mutation at amino acid 140 and/or 172 of IDH2.
         Without being bound by theory, applicants believe that mutant alleles of IDH2 wherein
the IDH2 mutation results in a new ability of the enzyme to catalyze the NADPH-dependent
reduction of a-ketoglutarate to R(-)-2-hydroxyglutarate, and in particular Rl40Q and/or R172K
mutations of IDH2, characterize a subset of all types of cancers, without regard to their cellular
nature or location in the body. Thus, the compounds and methods of one aspect of this invention
are useful to treat any type of cancer that is characterized by the presence of a mutant allele of
IDH2 imparting such acitivity and in particular an IDH2 R140Q and/or R172K mutation.
         In one aspect of this embodiment, the efficacy of cancer treatment is monitored by
measuring the levels of 2HG in the subject. Typically levels of 2HG are measured prior to
treatment, wherein an elevated level is indicated for the use of the compound of Formula I or II
or a compound described in any one of the embodiments described herein to treat the cancer.
Once the elevated levels are established, the level of 2HG is determined during the course of
and/or following termination of treatment to establish efficacy. In certain embodiments, the
level of 2HG is only determined during the course of and/or following termination of treatment.
A reduction of 2HG levels during the course of treatment and following treatment is indicative of
efficacy. Similarly, a determination that 2HG levels are not elevated during the course of or
following treatment is also indicative of efficacy. Typically, the these 2HG measurements will
be utilized together with other well-known determinations of efficacy of cancer treatment, such
as reduction in number and size of tumors and/or other cancer-associated lesions, improvement

in the general health of the subject, and alterations in other biomarkers that are associated with
cancer treatment efficacy.
        2HG can be detected in a sample by LC/MS. The sample is mixed 80:20 with methanol,
and centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 20 minutes at 4 degrees Celsius. The resulting supernatant can
be collected and stored at -80 degrees Celsius prior to LC-MS/MS to assess 2-hydroxyglutarate
levels. A variety of different liquid chromatography (LC) separation methods can be used. Each
method can be coupled by negative electrospray ionization (ESI, -3.0 kV) to triple-quadrupole
mass spectrometers operating in multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode, with MS
parameters optimized on infused metabolite standard solutions. Metabolites can be separated by
reversed phase chromatography using 10 mM tributyl-amine as an ion pairing agent in the
aqueous mobile phase, according to a variant of a previously reported method (Luo et al. J
ChromatogrA 1147, 153-64, 2007). One method allows resolution of TCA metabolites: t = 0,
50% B; t = 5, 95% B; t= 7, 95% B; t= 8, 0% B, where B refers to an organic mobile phase of
100% methanol. Another method is specific for 2-hydroxyglutarate, running a fast linear
gradient from 50% -95% B (buffers as defined above) over 5 minutes. A Synergi Hydro-RP,
100mm x 2 mm, 2.1 pm particle size (Phenomonex) can be used as the column, as described
above. Metabolites can be quantified by comparison of peak areas with pure metabolite
standards at known concentration. Metabolite flux studies from       1C-glutamine     can be performed
as described, e.g., in Munger et al. Nat Biotechnol 26, 1179-86, 2008.
        In one embodiment 2HG is directly evaluated.
        In another embodiment a derivative of 2HG formed in process of performing the analytic
method is evaluated. By way of example such a derivative can be a derivative formed in MS
analysis. Derivatives can include a salt adduct, e.g., a Na adduct, a hydration variant, or a
hydration variant which is also a salt adduct, e.g., a Na adduct, e.g., as formed in MS analysis.
        In another embodiment a metabolic derivative of 2HG is evaluated. Examples include
species that build up or are elevated, or reduced, as a result of the presence of 2HG, such as
glutarate or glutamate that will be correlated to 2HG, e.g., R-2HG.
        Exemplary 2HG derivatives include dehydrated derivatives such as the compounds
provided below or a salt adduct thereof:

         In one embodiment the cancer is a tumor wherein at least 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80 or 90% of
the tumor cells carry an IDH2 mutation, and in particular an IDH2 R140Q, R140W, or R140L
and/or R172K or R172G mutation, at the time of diagnosis or treatment.
         In another embodiment, one aspect of the invention provides a method of treating a
cancer selected from glioblastoma (glioma), ryelodysplastic syndrome (MDS),
myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN), acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), sarcoma, melanoma,
non-small cell lung cancer, chondrosarcoma, cholangiocarcinomas or angioimmunoblastic
lymphoma in a patient by administering to the patient a compound of Formula I or Formula II in
an amount effective to treat the cancer. In a more specific embodiment the cancer to be treated is
glioma, myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN), acute
myelogenous leukemia (AML), melanoma, chondrosarcoma, or angioimmunoblastic non
Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL).
         2HG is known to accumulate in the inherited metabolic disorder 2-hydroxyglutaric
aciduria. This disease is caused by deficiency in the enzyme 2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase,
which converts 2HG to a-KG (Struys, E. A. et al. Am J Hum Genet 76, 358-60 (2005)). Patients
with 2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase deficiencies accumulate 2HG in the brain as assessed by
MRI and CSF analysis, develop leukoencephalopathy, and have an increased risk of developing
brain tumors (Aghili, M., Zahedi, F. & Rafiee, J Neurooncol 91, 233-6 (2009); Kolker, S.,
Mayatepek, E. & Hoffmann, G. F. Neuropediatrics 33, 225-31 (2002); Wajner, M., Latini, A.,
Wyse, A. T. & Dutra-Filho, C. S. J Inherit Metab Dis 27, 427-48 (2004)). Furthermore, elevated
brain levels of 2HG result in increased ROS levels (Kolker, S. et al. Eur J Neurosci 16, 21-8
(2002); Latini, A. et al. Eur J Neurosci 17, 2017-22 (2003)), potentially contributing to an
increased risk of cancer. The ability of 2HG to act as an NMDA receptor agonist may contribute
to this effect (Kolker, S. et al. Eur J Neurosci 16, 21-8 (2002)). 2HG may also be toxic to cells
by competitively inhibiting glutamate and/or aKG utilizing enzymes. These include
transaminases which allow utilization of glutamate nitrogen for amino and nucleic acid
                                                   83

biosynthesis, and aKG-dependent prolyl hydroxylases such as those which regulate Hif1-alpha
levels.
        Thus, according to another embodiment, one aspect of the invention provides a method of
treating 2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria, particularly D-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria, in a patient by
administering to the patient a compound of Structural Formula I or II or a compound described in
any one of the embodiments described herein.
        Treatment methods described herein can additionally comprise various evaluation steps
prior to and/or following treatment with a compound of Structural Formula I or II or a compound
described in any one of the embodiments described herein.
        In one embodiment, prior to and/or after treatment with a compound of Structural
Formula I or II or a compound described in any one of the embodiments described herein, the
method further comprises the step of evaluating the growth, size, weight, invasiveness, stage
and/or other phenotype of the cancer.
        In one embodiment, prior to and/or after treatment with a compound of Formula I or II or
a compound described in any one of the embodiments described herein, the method further
comprises the step of evaluating the IDH2 genotype of the cancer. This may be achieved by
ordinary methods in the art, such as DNA sequencing, immuno analysis, and/or evaluation of the
presence, distribution or level of 2HG.
        In one embodiment, prior to and/or after treatment with a compound of Formula I or II or
a compound described in any one of the embodiments described herein, the method further
comprises the step of determining the 2HG level in the subject. This may be achieved by
spectroscopic analysis, e.g., magnetic resonance-based analysis, e.g., MRI and/or MRS
measurement, sample analysis of bodily fluid, such as serum or spinal cord fluid analysis, or by
analysis of surgical material, e.g., by mass-spectroscopy.
Combination therapies
        In some embodiments, the methods described herein comprise the additional step of
co-administering to a subject in need thereof a second therapy e.g., an additional cancer
therapeutic agent or an additional cancer treatment. Exemplary additional cancer therapeutic
agents include for example, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, antibody therapies, immunotherapy,

     WO 2013/102431                                                           PCT/CN2013/000009
and hormonal therapy. Additional cancer treatments include, for example: surgery, and
radiation therapy. Examples of each of these treatments are provided below.
        The term "co-administering" as used herein with respect to an additional cancer
therapeutic agents means that the additional cancer therapeutic agent may be administered
together with a compound of one aspect of this invention as part of a single dosage form (such as
a composition of one aspect of this invention comprising a compound of one aspect of the
invention and an second therapeutic agent as described above) or as separate, multiple dosage
forms. Alternatively, the additional cancer therapeutic agent may be administered prior to,
consecutively with, or following the administration of a compound of one aspect of this
invention. In such combination therapy treatment, both the compounds of one aspect of this
invention and the second therapeutic agent(s) are administered by conventional methods. The
administration of a composition of one aspect of this invention, comprising both a compound of
one aspect of the invention and a second therapeutic agent, to a subject does not preclude the
separate administration of that same therapeutic agent, any other second therapeutic agent or any
compound of one aspect of this invention to said subject at another time during a course of
treatment. The term "co-administering" as used herein with respect to an additional cancer
treatment means that the additional cancer treatment may occur prior to, consecutively with,
concurrently with or following the administration of a compound of one aspect of this invention.
        In some embodiments, the additional cancer therapeutic agent is a chemotherapy agent.
Examples of chemotherapeutic agents used in cancer therapy include, for example,
antimetabolites (e.g., folic acid, purine, and pyrimidine derivatives), alkylating agents (e.g.,
nitrogen mustards, nitrosoureas, platinum, alkyl sulfonates, hydrazines, triazenes, aziridines,
spindle poison, cytotoxic agents, topoisomerase inhibitors and others), and hypomethylating
agents (e.g., decitabine (5-aza-deoxycytidine), zebularine, isothiocyanates, azacitidine (5
azacytidine), 5-flouro-2'-deoxycytidine, 5,6-dihydro-5-azacytidine and others). Exemplary

        Because some drugs work better together than alone, two or more drugs are often given at
the same time. Often, two or more chemotherapy agents are used as combination chemotherapy.
        In some embodiments, the additional cancer therapeutic agent is a differentiation agent.
Such differentiation agent includes retinoids (such as all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA), 9-cis
retinoic acid, 13-cis-retinoic acid (13-cRA) and 4-hydroxy-phenretinamide (4-HPR)); arsenic
trioxide; histone deacetylase inhibitors HDACs (such as azacytidine (Vidaza) and butyrates (e.g.,
sodium phenylbutyrate)); hybrid polar compounds (such as hexamethylene bisacetamide
((HMBA)); vitamin D; and cytokines (such as colony-stimulating factors including G-CSF and
GM-CSF, and interferons).
        In some embodiments the additional cancer therapeutic agent is a targeted therapy agent.
Targeted therapy constitutes the use of agents specific for the deregulated proteins of cancer
cells. Small molecule targeted therapy drugs are generally inhibitors of enzymatic domains on
mutated, overexpressed, or otherwise critical proteins within the cancer cell. Prominent
examples are the tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as Axitinib, Bosutinib, Cediranib, dasatinib,
                                                 86

      WO 2013/102431                                                           PCT/CN2013/000009
erlotinib, imatinib, gefitinib, lapatinib, Lestaurtinib, Nilotinib, Semaxanib, Sorafenib, Sunitinib,
and Vandetanib, and also cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors such as Alvocidib and Seliciclib.
Monoclonal antibody therapy is another strategy in which the therapeutic agent is an antibody
which specifically binds to a protein on the surface of the cancer cells. Examples include the
anti-HER2/neu antibody trastuzumab (HERCEPTIN) typically used in breast cancer, and the
anti-CD20 antibody rituximab and Tositumomab typically used in a variety of B-cell
malignancies. Other exemplary antibodies include Cetuximab, Panitumumab, Trastuzumab,
Alemtuzumab, Bevacizumab, Edrecolomab, and Gemtuzumab. Exemplary fusion proteins
include Aflibercept and Denileukin diftitox. In some embodiments, the targeted therapy can be
used in combination with a compound described herein, e.g., a biguanide such as metformin or
phenformin, preferably phenformin.
         Targeted therapy can also involve small peptides as "homing devices" which can bind to
cell surface receptors or affected extracellular matrix surrounding the tumor. Radionuclides
which are attached to these peptides (e.g., RGDs) eventually kill the cancer cell if the nuclide
decays in the vicinity of the cell. An example of such therapy includes BEXXAR@.
         In some embodiments, the additional cancer therapeutic agent is an immunotherapy
agent. Cancer immunotherapy refers to a diverse set of therapeutic strategies designed to induce
the subject's own immune system to fight the tumor. Contemporary methods for generating an
immune response against tumors include intravesicular BCG immunotherapy for superficial
bladder cancer, and use of interferons and other cytokines to induce an immune response in renal
cell carcinoma and melanoma subjects.
         Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation can be considered a form of
immunotherapy, since the donor's immune cells will often attack the tumor in a
graft-versus-tumor effect. In some embodiments, the immunotherapy agents can be used in
combination with a compound or composition described herein.
         In some embodiments, the additional cancer therapeutic agent is a hormonal therapy
agent. The growth of some cancers can be inhibited by providing or blocking certain hormones.
Common examples of hormone-sensitive tumors include certain types of breast and prostate
cancers. Removing or blocking estrogen or testosterone is often an important additional
treatment. In certain cancers, administration of hormone agonists, such as progestogens may be
                                                    87

therapeutically beneficial. In some embodiments, the hormonal therapy agents can be used in
combination with a compound or a composition described herein.
          Other possible additional therapeutic modalities include imatinib, gene therapy, peptide
and dendritic cell vaccines, synthetic chlorotoxins, and radiolabeled drugs and antibodies.

Example 6, step 2: Preparation of tert-Butyl-(4-chloro-6-phenyl-[1,3,5]triazin-2-yl)-amine
To a solution of 2,4-dichloro-6-phenyl-1,3,5-triazine (500 mg, 2.212 mmol) in anhydrous THF (4
mL) was added dropwise a solution of tert-butylamine (194.1 mg, 2.654 mol) in THF (1 mL) at
room temperature via syringe under N 2 . After the addition, the mixture was stirred at room
temperature under N 2 for 2 hrs. The reaction was quenched by water (5 mL) and extracted with
ethyl acetate. The organic layer was dried, concentrated to afford
tert-butyl-(4-chloro-6-phenyl-[1,3, and 5]-triazin-2-yl)-amine as a white solid, which was used the
directly in the next step without purification.
Other amines 6 were also employed using the standard procedure described above to give the
desired intermediates and were also used in the next step directly without further purification.

amine (80 mg, 0.85 mmol), CsF (107.85 mg, 0.71 mmol) and DIlEA (275.30 mg, 2.13 mmol) in
DMSO (4 mL) was heated to 80 0C for 2 hours. The mixture was filtered and purified by a standard
method to give 6-(2-fluorophenyl)-N -isopropyl-N 4 -(pyridin-4-yl)- 1,3,5-triazine-2,4-diamine.
This compound was also produced by Step 3, procedure A of Example 4.

CuSO 4 5H 2 0 (14.9 g, 0.059 mol), followed by 2-methylpropan-2-amine (11.3 g, 0.155 mol). The
mixture was heated to reflux for 16 hours. To the mixture was added water (137 mL) and aq.HCl
(59.5 mL in 100 mL of water) at 25-30 0 C. The resultant mixture was stirred at r.t. for 30 min.
Then Na 2 S (47.6 g in 100 mL of water) was added and stirred for another 30 min. The insoluble
CuS was filtered off. The filtrate was cooled to 1 00 C and added aqueous NaOH (27 g NaOH in
100 mL water) dropwise. The mixture was extracted with dichloromethane (100 mLx3). The
aqueous layer was concentrated and the residue was added dichloromethane (200 mL) and the
mixture was stirred for 1 hour and the mixture was filtrated. The filtrated was concentrated to give
(E)-2-(tert-butyl)-1-(diaminomethylene)guanidine as a brown solid.

Example 12. Enzymatic and Cell Assays.
 Enzymatic Assay. Compounds are assayed for IDH2 R172K inhibitory activity through a cofactor
depletion assay. Compounds are preincubated with enzyme, then the reaction is started by the
addition of NADPH and a-KG, and allowed to proceed for 60 minutes under conditions previously
demonstrated to be linear with respect for time for consumption of both cofactor and substrate. The
reaction is terminated by the addition of a second enzyme, diaphorase, and a corresponding
substrate, resazurin. Diaphorase reduces resazurin to the highly fluorescent resorufin with the
concomitant oxidation of NADPH to NADP, both halting the IDH2 reaction by depleting the
available cofactor pool and facilitating quantitation of the amount of cofactor remaining after a
specific time period through quantitative production of an easily detected fluorophore.
         Specifically, into each of 12 wells of a 384-well plate, 1 l of 100x compound dilution
series is placed, followed by the addition of 40 p1 of buffer (50 mM potassium phosphate
(K 2 HPO4 ), pH 7.5; 150 mM NaCl; 10 mM MgCl 2 , 10% glycerol, 0.05% bovine serum albumin, 2
mM beta-mercaptoethanol) containing 1.25 pg/ml IDH2 R172K. The test compound is then
incubated for one hour at room temperature with the enzyme; before starting the IDH2 reaction
with the addition of 10     l of substrate mix containing 50 pM NADPH and 6.3 mM a-KG in the
buffer described above. After a further one hour of incubation at room temperature, the reaction is
halted and the remaining NADPH measured through conversion of resazurin to resorufin by the
                                                    257

addition of 25 p1 Stop Mix (36 pg/ml diaphorase enzyme and 60 pM resazurin; in buffer). After
one minute of incubation the plate is read on a plate reader at Ex544/Em590.
        For determination of the inhibitory potency of compounds against IDH2 R140Q in an assay
format similar to the above, a similar procedure is performed, except that the final testing
concentration is 0.25 pg/ml IDH2 R140Q protein, 4 pM NADPH and 1.6 mM a-KG.
        For determination of the inhibitory potency of compounds against IDH2 R140Q in a high
throughput screening format, a similar procedure is performed, except that 0.25 pg/ml IDH2
R140Q protein was utilized in the preincubation step, and the reaction is started with the addition
of 4 pM NADPH and 8 pM a-KG.
U87MGpLVX-IDH2 R140Q-neo Cell Based Assay. U87MG pLVX-IDH2 R140Q-neo cells are
grown in T125 flasks in DMEM containing 10% FBS, 1x penicillin/streptomycin and 500 Pg/mL
G418. They are harvested by trypsin and seeded into 96 well white bottom plates at a density of
5000 cell/well in 100   l/well in DMEM with 10% FBS. No cells are plated in columns 1 and 12.
Cells are incubated overnight at 37'C in 5% CO 2 . The next day compounds are made up at 2x
concentration and 100ul are added to each cell well. The final concentration of DMSO is 0.2%
and the DMSO control wells are plated in row G. The plates are then placed in the incubator for
48 hours. At 48 hours, 100ul of media is removed from each well and analyzed by LC-MS for
2-HG concentrations. The cell plate is placed back in the incubator for another 24 hours. At 72
hours post compound addition, 10 mL/plate of Promega Cell Titer Glo reagent is thawed and
mixed. The cell plate is removed from the incubator and allowed to equilibrate to room
temperature. Then 100ul of reagent is added to each well of media. The cell plate is then placed
on an orbital shaker for 10 minutes and then allowed to sit at room temperature for 20 minutes.
The plate is then read for luminescence with an integration time of 500ms to determine compound
effects on growth inhibition.
        The data for various compounds of one aspect of the invention in the R140Q enzymatic
assay, R140Q cell-based assay and R172K enzymatic assay as described above or similar thereto
