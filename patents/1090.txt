                      GEO SPATIAL ANALYSIS OF LEGAL DECISIONS
    This application is a divisional of Australian Patent Application No. 2013200222, the
    entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.
 5
    Technical Field
    Described embodiments, relate generally to methods and systems for facilitating geo
    spatial analysis of legal decisions, such as published or pending decisions made by a
   judicial or administrative body.
10
    Background
    Courts, tribunals and statutory authorities are frequently required to make decisions
    concerning parcels of land under various property, planning and environmental
    legislation, including planning schemes or ordinances and local laws.
15
    Many of these decisions reflect the particular locational attributes of the land and provide
    guidance in relation to manner in which various legislation should be applied to particular
   places or locations. In this way, property based decisions can be very influential and
    sometimes binding in subsequent decisions concerning nearby land or land exhibiting
20  similar characteristics.
    The ability of parties to identify decisions that will be influential in a particular case is
   therefore very important for the preparation of their cases.       When parties are able to
    easily identify decisions on nearby or similar land, it may also help to ensure that courts
25  and tribunals are more consistent in the way they apply the law to geographic areas.
    Existing tools available for parties to search property related decisions are generally
    limited to text based search engines provided by websites which are accessible online.
    These databases and websites require users to enter the text of nearby locations eg.
30  address, street or suburb name, and then return results based on the frequency of their
    occurrence in a particular decision or whether the address matches that stored in the

                                                    2
    database for a decision. The results returned by these databases are often inaccurate and
    it is difficult and inefficient to undertake any exhaustive search of a particular geographic
    area.
 5  It is desired to address or ameliorate one or more shortcomings or disadvantages of prior
    systems and methods, or to at least provide a useful alternative thereto.
    Throughout this specification the word "comprise", or variations such as "comprises" or
    "comprising", will be understood to imply the inclusion of a stated element, integer or
10  step, or group of elements, integers or steps, but not the exclusion of any other element,
    integer or step, or group of elements, integers or steps.
   Any discussion of documents, acts, materials, devices, articles or the like which has been
    included in the present specification is not to be taken as an admission that any or all of
15 these matters form part of the prior art base or were common general knowledge in the
    field relevant to the present invention as it existed before the priority date of each claim
    of this application.
20  Summary
    Some embodiments relate to a computer-implemented method, comprising:
             receiving at a first computer a location search request;
             processing the location search request by the first computer to determine location
    information;
25           querying a data store accessible to the first computer using the location
    information, the data store containing records of location-specific administrative or
   judicial decisions, to identify records associated with locations in a vicinity of a location
    specified by the location information; and
             generating code executable to cause a display application to display a cadastral
30  map display, the cadastral map display comprising a location marker for each record
    identified by the querying, wherein each location marker corresponds to a location
    affected by or the subject of a respective location-specific administrative or judicial
    decision; and
             providing the code to the display application.

                                                 3
   In some embodiments, the location search request may be received from a second
   computer over a network, such as the Internet. This second computer may receive the
   code and execute that code on a local display application, such as a browser application,
   in order to generate the cadastral map display. In other embodiments, the first computer
 5 may receive the location search request via a user interface associated with the first
   computer and the code may be executed by the display application on the first computer
   to provide the cadastral map display on the user interface associated with the first
   computer.
10 Some embodiments provide a website which enables parties to search for and analyse
   property-related legal decisions using a tool which displays their location graphically on a
   cadastral map. Whilst some embodiments may be accessed as a website via the internet,
   other embodiments may provide access locally on a single computer or through a private
   network of computers which are not publicly accessible.
15
   Some embodiments relate to a system comprising components or means to perform the
   described methods. Some embodiments relate to executable program code in computer
   readable storage to cause a computer to perform the described methods or implement the
   described systems.

   Detailed Description
 5 Referring to Figure 1, there is shown a system 100 for facilitating geo-spatial analysis of
   legal or administrative decisions, such as planning decisions. The system 100 comprises a
   client computing device 110 that may communicate over a network 120 with a server
   system 130.     The client computing device 110 may comprise a desktop, mobile or
   handheld computing device having a processor (CPU) and memory comprising volatile
10 (RAM) and non-volatile memory (a hard disk drive). The user interface may comprise a
   display including at least one input device such as a keyboard, mouse or touch screen that
   can provide input to the client computing device. Client system 110 may store executable
   program code and software applications in the non-volatile memory, including program
   code stored in memory 112 to implement an operating system 115 and a browser
15 application 118 to enable a user to navigate sites which are accessible over the network
    120. Client system 110 has at least one processor 111 that has access to the code in
   memory 112 in order to execute that code.
   Server system 130 comprises at least one processing device 131 to operate a web server
20 (HTTP) 146 or local server functions, data processing functions, data storage and
   retrieval functions (eg. Using MySQL 145 or SQL) in conjunction with databases 140
   and 150. Server system 130 may also comprise scripting language support such as PHP
   (144) or Microsoft ASP.NET and may also comprise non volatile data storage (memory
    132) for storing executable program code including operating system 134 and software
25 modules 135 for managing and processing functions for searching and displaying data.
   The at least one processing device 131 has access to the code in memory 132 in order to
   execute that code and perform the functions described herein.
   Software modules 135 include a module 136 to search and display map information, a
30 data collection module 137 and a data verification module 138, the functions of which are
   described in further detail below.

                                                5
   Databases 140 and 150 may comprise localised or distributed databases storing data
 5 records for mapping and cases.        The map database 140 will contain a range of
   information that will allow the case map 240 to display comprehensive contextual
   information, including street and place names, street numbers, property boundaries, land
   features and landmark buildings.     Importantly, the map data will include geographic
   coordinates to enable the precise location of each search location and legal decision to be
10 identified. The map data can be stored within the server system 130 or sourced on line
   from other websites or commercial providers of cadastral map information.
   The case database 150 will include information about various attributes of the decisions,
   including their street address, geographical coordinates, legal jurisdiction, key words or
15 summaries, reference numbers and URL addresses (if the decision is available online).
   The decisions may be primarily planning and property-related decisions issued by courts,
   tribunals or administrative review bodies, for example those decisions involving appeals
   or reviews of administrative decisions of a council, public authority or other primary
   decision-making body relating to land use or development. Other decisions may involve
20 appeals or review of decisions by public authorities in relation to the value ascribed to
   land for purposes of rating / taxing or for determining the amount of compensation
   payable for public acquisition of the land. Such decisions are location-specific and will
   include findings about the particular qualities or character of the land or its context and
   will have implications (and possibly precedential value) for future decisions in or around
25 a similar location.
   Case records can be manually inputted into the case database 150 or alternatively, by
   utilising software modules such as data collection module 137, can be electronically
   sourced from publicly accessible legal databases available online.        On suitable legal
30 databases the data collection module 137 can, when executed, source key case
   information such as URL, jurisdiction, street address and keywords by crawling or

                                                  6
   searching web pages containing the full text of legal decisions and then copying the data
   based on the typical text structure of the decision and pasting it into the case database 150
   based on that structure.     Where decision text is not structured consistently, the data
   collection module 137 can also obtain the street address of the decision by finding the
 5 first occurrence of a defined range of 'street types' (eg. Street, Road or Avenue) and then
   copying the text surrounding this word and parsing it into the case database 150 based on
   the typical address structure i.e. [street number] [street name] [street type], [suburb].
   In either case, the accuracy of the addresses of the cases will vary and will usually need
10 to be verified, either using a software procedure or manually. Once a street address is
   completed, the geographic coordinates of the location of the decision can be determined
   from the map database 140 and then accurately recorded in the case database 150. This
   can be achieved using the data verification module 138, which provides an interface with
   the case database 150 and enables any incomplete case records to be verified and
15 completed manually.
   In addition to past legal decisions, the case database 150 may also include information
   relating to pending decisions or proceedings which are yet to be determined.              This
   information may also be displayed on the case map 240 at the election of the user. The
20 purpose of mapping this information would be to provide notice to members of the
   community or potential parties about pending proceedings concerning nearby land which
   may affect their interests.
   Information regarding pending proceedings can be uploaded to the case database 150 by
25 registered users, including parties to the proceedings, and may include contact
   information and URL links to other websites which contain information about the
   proceeding including information about how to become involved in a proceeding or how
   to support persons or groups who are already parties.
30 Various embodiments can require users to register their details prior to accessing the
   search interface on the website. The details of the users can be stored in a user database

                                                  7
   on the server system 130, which may also save details of their searches for their future
   reference.
   Referring to Figure 3, once registered, users would need to log in prior to each session of
 5 use at step 305. Once successfully logged in, the client browser 112 will then send a page
   request to the server system 130, where the requested page comprises the search interface
   illustrated in figure 2.
   Referring to Figures 2 and 3, a search method 300 commences at step 315 where users
10 are required to enter a location search request into a search interface 205, including
   entering an address into the search query form in field 210. The location need not be
   specific to a particular property parcel and may simply identify a street in a particular
   suburb or just a suburb or postcode location.
15 The user may choose to specify the time period for cases at field 212 eg. "From years
    1999 to 2009", which would further limit the search to cases which were decided within
   that time period.
   Depending on the number of results returned for a particular location, various
20 embodiments may also allow user to further refine or filter the results by searching for
   additional criteria such as 'keywords' or 'catchwords' at field 211.         If this option is
   selected by users, then the database would only return cases proximate to the searched
   location which included the keywords identified by the user.
25 Once the location search terms are entered into search interface 205, the client browser
    112 will send the query to the server system 130 over network 120 which will query the
   map database 140 to determine the map coordinates of the search location at step 320.
   If coordinates are not available or if the entered search location is not valid, then the user
30 will be directed to re-enter a valid search location at step 315. If coordinates are available
   for the search location, the server system 120 will then query the case database 150 to

                                                   8
   determine what decisions relate to land within a predefined or user-defined distance of
   the searched location (eg. within a 1km to 5km radius) at step 340.
   Concurrently to step 340, the server system 130 will also query the map database 140 to
 5 assemble necessary cadastral data (step 325) in order to graphically display the case
   results retrieved at step 355 within a cadastral map as part of display 200.
   At step 355, case database 150 will return results according to a pre-defined maximum
   and minimum number of legal decisions that relate to property parcels within the
10 displayed map area. The results returned may also be limited to cases which meet other
   optional criteria set by the user in search interface 205 at step 315 (eg. Years, a date range
   and/or keywords).
   At step 350, the server system 120 will generate and then send executable code to enable
15 the client browser to display case map 240 centrally on the display 200, depicting a
   geographic area centered upon the search location 230. The search location 230 or a
   centroid of a specified location (where a street address is not provided in the search
   terms, for example) may be identified with a distinctive marker. The cases retrieved at
   step 355 are identified with distinctive map markers 250 graphically overlaid on the case
20 map 240.
   The extent of the area shown in the case map display 240 may be reduced or enlarged
   depending on the scale at which the user wishes to analyse the decisions shown on the
   map. The map display is initially displayed at a default map scale.
25
   By selection or mouseover of the map markers 250 in the client browser 112, a pop-up
   display window 220 will be shown, so users will be able see the key (summary) details of
   the particular decision (including case title and street address) in window 220. If the
   decision is available online, the window 220 may also include a universal resource
30 locator (URL) or active link (such as a hyperlink) to that case in the available online
   repository.

                                              9
   The map markers 250 may also be numbered and a corresponding numbered list 260 may
5 be displayed beneath the map so that users can immediately identify the details of a case
   shown on the map without selecting map markers 250. The numbered list 260 may also
   order the cases according to their characteristics, including their date or the particular
  jurisdiction of the court or tribunal.
