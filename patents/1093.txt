                           IMIDAZOPYRIDINES SYK INHIBITORS
This application is a divisional of Australian patent application no. <removed-apn>, the entire disclosure of
which is incorporated herein by reference.
Field of the Invention
[0001] Provided herein are certain imidazopyridines, compositions, and methods of their
manufacture and use.
Background
[0002] Protein kinases, the largest family of human enzymes, encompass well over 500
proteins. Spleen Tyrosine Kinase (Syk) is a member of the Syk family of tyrosine kinases,
and is a regulator of early B-cell development as well as mature B-cell activation, signaling,
and survival.
[00031 Syk is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase that plays critical roles in immunoreceptor- and
integrin-mediated signaling in a variety of cell types, including B-cells, macrophages,
monocytes, mast cells, eosinophils, basophils, neutrophils, dendritic cells, platelets, and
osteoclasts. Immunoreceptors as described here include classical immunoreceptors and
immunoreceptor-like molecules. Classical immunoreceptors include B-cell and T-cell
antigen receptors as well as various immunoglobulin receptors (Fe receptors).
Immunoreceptor-like molecules are either structurally related to immunoreceptors or
participate in similar signal transduction pathways and are primarily involved in non-adaptive
immune functions, including neutrophil activation, natural killer cell recognition, and
osteoclast activity. Integrins are cell surface receptors that play key roles in the control of
leukocyte adhesion and activation in both innate and adaptive immunity.
[0004] Ligand binding leads to activation of both immunoreceptors and integrins, which
results in Src family kinases being activated, and phosphorylation of immunoreceptor
tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) in the cytoplasmic face of receptor-associated
transmembrane adaptors. Syk binds to the phosphorylated ITAM motifs of the adaptors,
leading to activation of Syk and subsequent phosphorylation and activation of downstream
signaling pathways.
[0005] Syk is essential for B-cell activation through B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling. Syk
becomes activated upon binding to phosphoryated BCR and thus initiates the early signaling
events following BCR activation. B-cell signaling through BCR can lead to a wide range of

biological outputs, which in turn depend on the developmental stage of the B-cell. The
magnitude and duration of BCR signals must be precisely regulated. Aberrant BCR
mediated signaling can cause disregulated B-cell activation and/or the formation of
pathogenic auto-antibodies leading to multiple autoimmune and/or inflammatory diseases.
 Mice lacking Syk show impaired maturation of B-cells, diminished immunoglobulin
production, compromised T-cell-independent immune responses and marked attenuation of
the sustained calcium sign upon BCR stimulation.
 [0006] A large body of evidence supports the role of B-cells and the humoral immune system
in the pathogenesis of autoimmune and/or inflammatory diseases. Protein-based therapeutics
 (such as Rituxan) developed to deplete B-cells represent an approach to the treatment of a
number of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Auto-antibodies and their resulting
immune complexes are known to play pathogenic roles in autoimmune disease and/or
inflammatory disease. The pathogenic response to these antibodies is dependent on signaling
through Fe Receptors, which is, in turn, dependent upon Syk. Because of Syk's role in B-cell
activation, as well as FcR dependent signaling, inhibitors of Syk can be useful as inhibitors of
B-cell mediated pathogenic activity, including autoantibody production. Therefore,
inhibition of Syk enzymatic activity in cells is proposed as a treatment for autoimmune
disease through its effects on autoantibody production.
 [0007] Syk also plays a key role in FCeRI mediated mast cell degranulation and eosinophil
activation. Thus, Syk is implicated in allergic disorders including asthma. Syk binds to the
phosphorylated gamma chain of FCeRI via its SH2 domains and is essential for downstream
signaling. Syk deficient mast cells demonstrate defective degranulation, arachidonic acid and
cytokine secretion. This also has been shown for pharmacologic agents that inhibit Syk
activity in mast cells. Treatment with Syk antisense oligonucleotides inhibits antigen
induced infiltration of eosinophils and neutrophils in an animal model of asthma. Syk
deficient eosinophils also show impaired activation in response to FCeRI stimulation.
Therefore, small molecule inhibitors of Syk will be useful for treatment of allergy-induced
inflammatory diseases including asthma.
 [0008] Syk is also expressed in mast cells and monocytes and has been shown to be
important for the function of these cells. For example, Syk deficiency in mice is associated
with impaired IgE-mediated mast cell activation, manifested as marked diminution of TNF
alpha and other inflammatory cytokine release. Syk kinase inhibitors have also been shown
to inhibit mast cell degranulation in cell based assays. Additionally, Syk inhibitors have been
                                                 2

shown to inhibit antigen-induced passive cutaneous anaphylaxsis, bronchoconstriction and
bronchial edema in rats.
[00091 Thus, the inhibition of Syk activity can be useful for the treatment of allergic
disorders, autoimmune diseases and inflammatory diseases such as: SLE, rheumatoid
arthritis, multiple vasculitides, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), fibrotic disease,
myasthenia gravis, allergic rhinitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), adult
respiratory distress syndrome (ARDs) and asthma. In addition, Syk has been reported to play
an important role in ligand-independent tonic signaling through the B-cell receptor, known to
be an important survival signal in B-cells. Thus, inhibition of Syk activity may be useful in
treating certain types of cancer, including B-cell lymphoma and leukemia.

                       DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
Definitions and General Parameters
 101191 As used herein, when any variable occurs more than one time in a chemical formula,
its definition on each occurrence is independent of its definition at every other occurrence. In
accordance with the usual meaning of "a" and "the" in patents, reference, for example, to "a"
kinase or "the" kinase is inclusive of one or more kinases.
 [0120] As used in the present specification, the following words, phrases and symbols are
generally intended to have the meanings as set forth below, except to the extent that the
context in which they are used indicates otherwise. The following abbreviations and terms
have the indicated meanings throughout:
 [01211 A dash ("-")that is not between two letters or symbols is used to indicate a point of
attachment for a substituent. For example, -CONH 2 is attached through the carbon atom.
 [01221 By "optional" or "optionally" is meant that the subsequently described event or
circumstance may or may not occur, and that the description includes instances where the
event or circumstance occurs and instances in which it does not. For example, "optionally
substituted alkyl" encompasses both "alkyl" and "substituted alkyl" as defined below. It will
be understood by those skilled in the art, with respect to any group containing one or more
substituents, that such groups are not intended to introduce any substitution or substitution
patterns that are sterically impractical, synthetically non-feasible and/or inherently unstable.
 [01231 "Alkyl" encompasses straight chain and branched chain having the indicated number
of carbon atoms, usually from 1 to 20 carbon atoms, for example I to 8 carbon atoms, such as
 I to 6 carbon atoms. For example C-C      6 alkyl encompasses both straight and branched chain
alkyl of from 1 to 6 carbon atoms. Examples of alkyl groups include methyl, ethyl, propyl,
isopropyl, n-butyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl, pentyl, 2-pentyl, isopentyl, neopentyl, hexyl, 2-hexyl,
3-hexyl, 3-methylpentyl, and the like. Alkylene is another subset of alkyl, referring to the
same residues as alkyl, but having two points of attachment. Alkylene groups will usually
have from 2 to 20 carbon atoms, for example 2 to 8 carbon atoms, such as from 2 to 6 carbon
atoms. For example, CO alkylene indicates a covalent bond and C1 alkylene is a methylene
group. When an alkyl residue having a specific number of carbons is named, all geometric
isomers having that number of carbons are intended to be encompassed; thus, for example,
"butyl" is meant to include n-butyl, sec-butyl, isobutyl and t-butyl; "propyl" includes n-propyl
and isopropyl. "Lower alkyl" refers to alkyl groups having 1 to 4 carbons.
                                                  10

 [0124] "Alkenyl" indicates an unsaturated branched or straight-chain alkyl group having at
least one carbon-carbon double bond derived by the removal of one molecule of hydrogen
from adjacent carbon atoms of the parent alkyl. The group may be in either the cis or trans
configuration about the double bond(s). Typical alkenyl groups include, but are not limited
to, ethenyl; propenyls such as prop-1-en-I-yl, prop-I-en-2-yl, prop-2-en-I-yl (allyl), prop-2
en-2-yl; butenyls such as but-I-en-i -yl, but-i -en-2-yl, 2-methyl-prop-I-en-i -yl, but-2-en- 1
yl, but-2-en-1-yl, but-2-en-2-yl, buta-1,3-dien-1-yl, buta-1,3-dien-2-yl; and the like. In some
embodiments, an alkenyl group has from 2 to 20 carbon atoms and in other embodiments,
from 2 to 6 carbon atoms.
 [01251 "Cycloalkyl" indicates a saturated hydrocarbon ring group, having the specified
number of carbon atoms, usually from 3 to 7 ring carbon atoms. Examples of cycloalkyl
groups include cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, and cyclohexyl as well as bridged and
caged saturated ring groups such as norbornane.
 10126] By "alkoxy" is meant an alkyl group of the indicated number of carbon atoms
attached through an oxygen bridge such as, for example, methoxy, ethoxy, propoxy,
isopropoxy, n-butoxy, see-butoxy, tert-butoxy, pentoxy, 2-pentyloxy, isopentoxy,
neopentoxy, hexoxy, 2-hexoxy, 3-hexoxy, 3-methylpentoxy, and the like. Alkoxy groups
will usually have from 1 to 6 carbon atoms attached through the oxygen bridge. "Lower
alkoxy" refers to alkoxy groups having 1 to 4 carbons.
 10127] "Aminocarbonyl" encompasses a group of the formula -(C=0)NRa R where Ra and
R are independently chosen from hydrogen and the optional substituents for "substituted
amino" described below.
 [01281 "Acyl" refers to the groups (alkyl)-C(O)-; (cycloalkyl)-C(O)-; (aryl)-C(O)-;
(heteroaryl)-C(O)-; and (heterocycloalkyl)-C(O)-, wherein the group is attached to the parent
structure through the carbonyl functionality and wherein alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, heteroaryl,
and heterocycloalkyl are as described herein. Acyl groups have the indicated number of
carbon atoms, with the carbon of the keto group being included in the numbered carbon
atoms. For example a C 2 acyl group is an acetyl group having the formula CH 3 (C=O)-.
[01291 By "alkoxycarbonyl" is meant an ester group of the formula (alkoxy)(C=O)- attached
through the carbonyl carbon wherein the alkoxy group has the indicated number of carbon
atoms. Thus a C1-C6 alkoxycarbonyl group is an alkoxy group having from 1 to 6 carbon
atoms attached through its oxygen to a carbonyl linker.
                                                 Il

[01301 By "amino" is meant the group -NH 2 .
[01311 "Aryl" encompasses:
        5- and 6-membered carbocyclic aromatic rings, for example, benzene;
        bicyclic ring systems wherein at least one ring is carbocyclic and aromatic, for
                 example, naphthalene, indane, and tetralin; and
        tricyclic ring systems wherein at least one ring is carbocyclic and aromatic, for
                 example, fluorene.
[0132] For example, aryl includes 5- and 6-membered carbocyclic aromatic rings fused to a
5- to 7-membered heterocycloalkyl ring containing 1 or more heteroatoms chosen from N, 0,
and S. For such fused, bicyclic ring systems wherein only one of the rings is a carbocyclic
aromatic ring, the point of attachment may be at the carbocyclic aromatic ring or the
heterocycloalkyl ring. Bivalent radicals forned from substituted benzene derivatives and
having the free valences at ring atoms are named as substituted phenylene radicals. Bivalent
radicals derived from univalent polycyclic hydrocarbon radicals whose names end in "-yl" by
removal of one hydrogen atom from the carbon atom with the free valence are named by
adding "-idene" to the name of the corresponding univalent radical, e.g., a naphthyl group
with two points of attachment is tended naphthylidene. Aryl, however, does not encompass
or overlap in any way with heteroaryl, separately defined below. Hence, if one or more
carbocyclic aromatic rings is fused with a heterocycloalkyl aromatic ring, the resulting ring
system is heteroaryl, not aryl, as defined herein.
[0133] The term "aryloxy" refers to the group -0-aryl.
[01341 The term "halo" includes fluoro, chloro, bromo, and iodo, and the tenn "halogen"
includes fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine.
[01351 "Heteroaryl" encompasses:
        5- to 7-membered aromatic, monocyclic rings containing one or more, for example,
                 from 1 to 4, or in some embodiments, from I to 3, heteroatoms chosen from
                 N, 0, and S, with the remaining ring atoms being carbon; and
        bicyclic heterocycloalkyl rings containing one or more, for example, from 1 to 4, or in
                 some embodiments, from 1 to 3, heteroatoms chosen from N, 0, and S, with
                 the remaining ring atoms being carbon and wherein at least one heteroatom is
                 present in an aromatic ring.
                                                 12

 [01361 For example, heteroaryl includes a 5- to 7-membered heterocycloalkyl, aromatic ring
fused to a 5- to 7-membered cycloalkyl ring. For such fused, bicyclic heteroaryl ring systems
wherein only one of the rings contains one or more heteroatoms, the point of attachment may
be at the heteroaromatic ring or the cycloalkyl ring. When the total number of S and 0 atoms
in the heteroaryl group exceeds 1, those heteroatoms are not adjacent to one another. In some
embodiments, the total number of S and 0 atoms in the heteroaryl group is not more than 2.
In some embodiments, the total number of S and 0 atoms in the aromatic heterocycle is not
more than 1. Examples of heteroaryl groups include, but are not limited to, (as numbered
from the linkage position assigned priority 1), 2-pyridyl, 3-pyridyl, 4-pyridyl, 2,3-pyrazinyl,
3,4-pyrazinyl, 2,4-pyrimidinyl, 3,5-pyrimidinyl, 2,3-pyrazolinyl, 2,4-imidazolinyl,
isoxazolinyl, oxazolinyl, thiazolinyl, thiadiazolinyl, tetrazolyl, thienyl, benzothiophenyl,
furanyl, benzofuranyl, benzoimidazolinyl, indolinyl, pyridizinyl, triazolyl, quinolinyl,
pyrazolyl, and 5,6,7,8-tetrahydroisoquinoline. Bivalent radicals derived from univalent
heteroaryl radicals whose names end in "-yl" by removal of one hydrogen atom from the
atom with the free valence are named by adding "-idene" to the name of the corresponding
univalent radical, e.g., a pyridyl group with two points of attachment is a pyridylidene.
Heteroaryl does not encompass or overlap with aryl as defined above.
[01371 Substituted heteroaryl also includes ring systems substituted with one or more oxide (
0) substituents, such as pyridinyl N-oxides.
[01381 The term "heteroaryloxy" refers to the group -0-heteroaryl.
[01391 By "heterocycloalkyl" is meant a single aliphatic ring, usually with 3 to 7 ring atoms,
containing at least 2 carbon atoms in addition to 1-3 heteroatoms independently selected from
oxygen, sulfur, and nitrogen, as well as combinations comprising at least one of the foregoing
heteroatoms. Suitable heterocycloalkyl groups include, for example (as numbered from the
linkage position assigned priority 1), 2-pyrrolinyl, 2,4-imidazolidinyl, 2,3-pyrazolidinyl, 2
piperidinyl, 3-piperidinyl, 4-piperidinyl, and 2,5-piperazinyl. Morpholinyl groups are also
contemplated, including 2-morpholinyl and 3-morpholinyl (numbered wherein the oxygen is
assigned priority 1). Substituted heterocycloalkyl also includes ring systems substituted with
one or more oxo moieties, such as piperidinyl N-oxide, morpholinyl-N-oxide, 1-oxo- 1
thiomorpholinyl and 1,1 -dioxo-l -thiomorpholinyl.
[0140] The term "heterocycloalkyloxy" refers to the group -0-heterocylcoalkyl.
10141] The term "nitro" refers to the group -N02.
                                                13

 [0142] The term "phosphono" refers to the group -P03H2.
 [01431 "Thiocarbonyl" refers to the group -C(=0)SH.
 [01441 The term "optionally substituted thiocarbonyl" includes the following groups:
 [0145] -C(=O)S-( optionally substituted (C-C)alkyl), -C(=0) S -(optionally substituted aryl),
 C(=0) S -(optionally substituted heteroaryl), and -C(=0) S-(optionally substituted
heterocycloalkyl).
 [01461 The term "sulfanyl" includes the groups: -S-( optionally substituted (CI-C 6 )alkyl),
 -S-(optionally substituted aryl), -S-(optionally substituted heteroaryl), and -S-(optionally
 substituted heterocycloalkyl). Hence, sulfanyl includes the group Cl-C6 alkylsulfanyl.
 [0147] The term "sulfinyl" includes the groups: -S(O)-H, -S(0)-(optionally substituted (Cl
C6)alkyl), -S(O)-optionally substituted aryl), -S(O)-optionally substituted heteroaryl),
-S(O)-(optionally substituted heterocycloalkyl); and -S(0)-(optionally substituted amino).
 101481 The term "sulfonyl" includes the groups: -S(02)-H, -S(02)-(optionally substituted
(Cl-C6)alkyl), -S(02)-optionally substituted aryl), -S(02)-optionally substituted heteroaryl),
-S(02)-(optionally substituted heterocycloalkyl)      ,-S(02)-(optionally substituted alkoxy),
-S(02)-optionally substituted aryloxy), -S(02)-optionally substituted heteroaryloxy),
-S(02)-(optionally substituted heterocyclyloxy); and -S(O2)-(optionally substituted amino).
 101491 The term "substituted", as used herein, means that any one or more hydrogens on the
designated atom or group is replaced with a selection from the indicated group, provided that
the designated atom's normal valence is not exceeded. When a substituent is oxo (i.e., =0)
then 2 hydrogens on the atom are replaced. Combinations of substituents and/or variables are
permissible only if such combinations result in stable compounds or useful synthetic
intermediates. A stable compound or stable structure is meant to imply a compound that is
sufficiently robust to survive isolation from a reaction mixture, and subsequent formulation
as an agent having at least practical utility. Unless otherwise specified, substituents are
named into the core structure. For example, it is to be understood that when (cycloalkyl)alkyl
is listed as a possible substituent, the point of attachment of this substituent to the core
structure is in the alkyl portion.
[0150] The terms "substituted" alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, heterocycloalkyl, and heteroaryl
(including without limitation pyridinyl, pyridizinyl, pyrazolyl, oxazolyl, pyrrolyl, thiazolyl,
and imidazolyl group), unless otherwise expressly defined, refer respectively to alkyl,

by conventional methods such as crystallization in the presence of a resolving agent, or
chromatography, using, for example a chiral high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC)
column. In addition, such compounds include Z- and E- forms (or cis- and trans- fonns) of
compounds with carbon-carbon double bonds. Where compounds described herein exist in
various tautomeric forms, chemical entities include all tautomeric forms of the compound.
Such compounds also include crystal forms including polymorphs and clathrates.
10160] Compounds of Formula I also include crystalline and amorphous forms of those
compounds, including, for example, polymorphs, pseudopolymorphs, solvates, hydrates,
unsolvated polymorphs (including anhydrates), conformational polymorphs, and amorphous
forms of the compounds, as well as mixtures thereof. "Crystalline form," "polymorph," and
"novel form" may be used interchangeably herein, and are meant to include all crystalline and
amorphous forms of the compound, including, for example, polymorphs, pseudopolymorphs,
solvates, hydrates, unsolvated polymorphs (including anhydrates), conformational
polymorphs, and amorphous forms, as well as mixtures thereof, unless a particular crystalline
or amorphous form is referred to. Compounds of Formula I also include pharmaceutically
acceptable forms of the recited compounds, including chelates, non-covalent complexes,
prodrugs, and mixtures thereof.
101611 Compounds of Formula I also include different enriched isotopic forms, e.g.,
compounds enriched in the content of 2H, 3H, 11 C, 13C and/or 14C. In some embodiments,
the compounds are deuterated. Such deuterated fonns can be made by the procedure
described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,846,514 and 6,334,997. As described in U.S. Patent Nos.
5,846,514 and 6,334,997, deuteration may improve the efficacy and increase the duration of
action of drugs.
101621 Deuterium substituted compounds can be synthesized using various methods such as
described in: Dean, Dennis C.; Editor. Recent Advances in the Synthesis and Applications of
Radiolabeled Compounds for Drug Discovery and Development. [In: Curr., Phanr. Des.,
2000; 6(10)] 2000, 110; Kabalka, George W.; Varma, Rajender S. The Synthesis of
Radiolabeled Compounds via Organometallic Intermediates, Tetrahedron, 1989, 45(21),

 [01631 Chemical entities include, but are not limited to compounds described herein and all
pharmaceutically acceptable fonns thereof. Hence, the terms "chemical entity" and
"chemical entities" also encompass pharmaceutically acceptable salts.
 [01641 "Pharmaceutically acceptable salts" include, but are not limited to salts with inorganic
acids, such as hydrochlorate, phosphate, diphosphate, hydrobromate, sulfate, sulfinate,
nitrate, and like salts; as well as salts with an organic acid, such as malate, maleate, fumarate,
tartrate, succinate, citrate, acetate, lactate, methanesulfonate, p-toluenesulfonate, 2
hydroxyethylsulfonate, benzoate, salicylate, stearate, and alkanoate such as acetate, HOOC
(CH 2 )n-COOH where n is 0-4, and like salts. Similarly, pharmaceutically acceptable cations
include, but are not limited to sodium, potassium, calcium, aluminum, lithium, and
ammonium.
[01651 In addition, if the compounds described herein are obtained as an acid addition salt,
the free base can be obtained by basifying a solution of the acid salt. Conversely, if the
product is a free base, an addition salt, particularly a pharmaceutically acceptable addition
salt, may be produced by dissolving the free base in a suitable organic solvent and treating
the solution with an acid, in accordance with conventional procedures for preparing acid
addition salts from base compounds. Those skilled in the art will recognize various synthetic
methodologies that may be used to prepare non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable addition
salts.
[0166] As noted above, prodrugs also fall within the scope of compounds of Formula I. In
some embodiments, the "prodrugs" described herein include any compound that becomes a
compound of Formula I when administered to a patient, e.g., upon metabolic processing of
the prodrug. Examples of prodrugs include derivatives of functional groups, such as a
carboxylic acid group, in the compounds of Fonnula I. Exemplary prodrugs of a carboxylic
acid group include, but are not limited to, carboxylic acid esters such as alkyl esters,
hydroxyalkyl esters, arylalkyl esters, and aryloxyalkyl esters.
[01671 A "solvate" is formed by the interaction of a solvent and a compound. The term
"compound" is intended to include solvates of compounds. Similarly, "salts" includes
solvates of salts. Suitable solvates are phannaceutically acceptable solvates, such as
hydrates, including monohydrates and hemi-hydrates.
                                                   18

 101681 A "chelate" is formed by the coordination of a compound to a metal ion at two (or
more) points. The term "compound" is intended to include chelates of compounds.
Similarly, "salts" includes chelates of salts.
101691 A "non-covalent complex" is formed by the interaction of a compound and another
molecule wherein a covalent bond is not formed between the compound and the molecule.
For example, complexation can occur through van der Waals interactions, hydrogen bonding,
and electrostatic interactions (also called ionic bonding). Such non-covalent complexes are
included in the term "compound'.
[0170] The term "hydrogen bond" refers to a form of association between an electronegative
atom (also known as a hydrogen bond acceptor) and a hydrogen atom attached to a second,
relatively electronegative atom (also known as a hydrogen bond donor). Suitable hydrogen
bond donor and acceptors are well understood in medicinal chemistry (G. C. Pimentel and A.
L. McClellan, The Hydrogen Bond, Freeman, San Francisco, 1960; R. Taylor and 0.
Kennard, "Hydrogen Bond Geometry in Organic Crystals", Accounts of Chemical Research,
17, pp. 320-326 (1984)).
[01711 "Hydrogen bond acceptor" refers to a group comprising an oxygen or nitrogen,
especially an oxygen or nitrogen that is sp2-hybridized, an ether oxygen, or the oxygen of a
sulfoxide or N-oxide.
[01721 The term "hydrogen bond donor" refers to an oxygen, nitrogen, or heteroaromatic
carbon that bears a hydrogen.group containing a ring nitrogen or a heteroaryl group
containing a ring nitrogen.
[0173] As used herein the terms "group", "radical" or "fragment" are synonymous and are
intended to indicate functional groups or fragments of molecules attachable to a bond or other
fragments of molecules.
[01741 The term "active agent" is used to indicate a chemical entity which has biological
activity. In some embodiments, an "active agent" is a compound having pharmaceutical
utility. For example an active agent may be an anti-cancer therapeutic.
[01751 The term "therapeutically effective amount" of a chemical entity described herein
means an amount effective, when administered to a human or non-human patient, to provide
a therapeutic benefit such as amelioration of symptoms, slowing of disease progression, or
prevention of disease e.g., a therapeutically effective amount may be an amount sufficient to
decrease the symptoms of a disease responsive to inhibition of Syk activity. In some
                                                 19

 embodiments, a therapeutically effective amount is an amount sufficient to reduce cancer
 symptoms, the symptoms of an allergic disorder, the symptoms of an autoimmune and/or
 inflammatory disease, or the symptoms of an acute inflammatory reaction. In some
 embodiments a therapeutically effective amount is an amount sufficient to decrease the
number of detectable cancerous cells in an organism, detectably slow, or stop the growth of a
 cancerous tumor. In some embodiments, a therapeutically effective amount is an amount
 sufficient to shrink a cancerous tumor. In some embodiments, a patient suffering from cancer
may not present symptoms of being affected. In some embodiments, a therapeutically
effective amount of a chemical entity is an amount sufficient to prevent a significant increase
or significantly reduce the detectable level of cancerous cells or cancer markers in the
patient's blood, serum, or tissues. In some embodiments, a therapeutically effective amount
may also be an amount sufficient, when administered to a patient, to detectably slow
progression of the disease, or prevent the patient to whom the chemical entity is given from
presenting symptoms of the allergic disorders and/or autoimmune and/or inflammatory
disease, and/or acute inflammatory response. In some embodiments, a therapeutically
effective amount may also be an amount sufficient to produce a detectable decrease in the
amount of a marker protein or cell type in the patient's blood or serum. In some
embodiments a therapeutically effective amount is an amount of a chemical entity described
herein sufficient to significantly decrease the activity of B-cells. In some embodiments, a
therapeutically effective amount is an amount of a chemical entity described herein sufficient
to decrease the level of anti- acetylcholine receptor antibody in a patient's blood with the
disease myasthenia gravis.
[0176] The term "inhibition" indicates a significant decrease in the baseline activity of a
biological activity or process. "Inhibition of Syk activity" refers to a decrease in Syk activity
as a direct or indirect response to the presence of at least one chemical entity described
herein, relative to the activity of Syk in the absence of the at least one chemical entity. The
decrease in activity may be due to the direct interaction of the compound with Syk, or due to
the interaction of the chemical entity(ies) described herein with one or more other factors that
in turn affect Syk activity. For example, the presence of the chemical entity(ies) may
decrease Syk activity by directly binding to the Syk, by causing (directly or indirectly)
another factor to decrease Syk activity, or by (directly or indirectly) decreasing the amount of
Syk present in the cell or organism.
                                                 20

[01771 Inhibition of Syk activity also refers to observable inhibition of Syk activity in a
standard biochemical assay for Syk activity, such as the ATP hydrolysis assay described
below. In some embodiments, the chemical entity described herein has an IC50 value less
than or equal to 1 micromolar. In some embodiments, the chemical entity has an IC50 value
less than or equal to less than 100 nanomolar. In some embodiments, the chemical entity has
an IC50 value less than or equal to 10 nanomolar.
[0178] "Inhibition of B-cell activity" refers to a decrease in B-cell activity as a direct or
indirect response to the presence of at least one chemical entity described herein, relative to
the activity of B-cells in the absence of the at least one chemical entity. The decrease in
activity may be due to the direct interaction of the compound with Syk or with one or more
other factors that in turn affect B-cell activity.
[01791 Inhibition of B-cell activity also refers to observable inhibition of CD86 expression in
a standard assay such as the assay described below. In some embodiments, the chemical
entity described herein has an IC50 value less than or equal to 10 micromolar. In some
embodiments, the chemical entity has an IC50 value less than or equal to less than 1
micromolar. In some embodiments, the chemical entity has an IC50 value less than or equal
to 500 nanomolar.
[0180] "B-cell activity" also includes activation, redistribution, reorganization, or capping of
one or more various B-cell membrane receptors, or membrane-bound immunoglobulins, e.g,
IgM, IgG, and IgD. Most B-cells also have membrane receptors for Fc portion of IgG in the
form of either antigen-antibody complexes or aggregated IgG. B-cells also carry membrane
receptors for the activated components of complement, e.g., C3b, C3d, C4, and Clq. These
various membrane receptors and membrane-bound immunoglobulins have membrane
mobility and can undergo redistribution and capping that can initiate signal transduction.
[0181] B-cell activity also includes the synthesis or production of antibodies or
immunoglobulins. Immunoglobulins are synthesized by the B-cell series and have common
structural features and structural units. Five immunoglobulin classes, i.e., IgG, IgA, IgM,
IgD, and IgE, are recognized on the basis of structural differences of their heavy chains
including the amino acid sequence and length of the polypeptide chain. Antibodies to a given
antigen may be detected in all or several classes of immunoglobulins or may be restricted to a
single class or subclass of immunoglobulin. Autoantibodies or autoimmune antibodies may
likewise belong to one or several classes of immunoglobulins. For example, rheumatoid
                                                   21

factors (antibodies to IgG) are most often recognized as an IgM imnnunoglobulin, but can
also consist of IgG or IgA.
 101821 In addition, B-cell activity also is intended to include a series of events leading to B
cell clonal expansion (proliferation) from precursor B lymphocytes and differentiation into
antibody-synthesizing plasma cells which takes place in conjunction with antigen-binding
and with cytokine signals from other cells.
 [0183] "Inhibition of B-cell proliferation" refers to inhibition of proliferation of abnormal
B-cells, such as cancerous B-cells, e.g. lymphoma B-cells and/ or inhibition of normal, non
diseased B-cells. The term "inhibition of B-cell proliferation" indicates any significant
decrease in the number of B-cells, either in vitro or in vivo. Thus an inhibition of B-cell
proliferation in vitro would be any significant decrease in the number of B-cells in an in vitro
sample contacted with at least one chemical entity described herein as compared to a matched
sample not contacted with the chemical entity(ies).
[0184] Inhibition of B-cell proliferation also refers to observable inhibition of B-cell
proliferation in a standard thymidine incorporation assay for B-cell proliferation, such as the
assay described herein. In some embodiments, the chemical entity has an IC50 value less
than or equal to 10 micromolar. In some embodiments, the chemical entity has an IC50 value
less than or equal to less than 1 micromolar. In some embodiments, the chemical entity has
an IC50 value less than or equal to 500 nanomolar.
10185] An "allergy" or "allergic disorder" refers to acquired hypersensitivity to a substance
(allergen). Allergic conditions include eczema, allergic rhinitis or coryza, hay fever,
bronchial asthma, urticaria (hives) and food allergies, and other atopic conditions.
[0186] "Asthma" refers to a disorder of the respiratory system characterized by inflammation,
narrowing of the airways and increased reactivity of the airways to inhaled agents. Asthma is
frequently, although not exclusively associated with atopic or allergic symptoms.
[0187] By "significant" is meant any detectable change that is statistically significant in a
standard parametric test of statistical significance such as Student's T-test, where p < 0.05.
[01881 A "disease responsive to inhibition of Syk activity" is a disease in which inhibiting
Syk kinase provides a therapeutic benefit such as an amelioration of symptoms, decrease in
disease progression, prevention or delay of disease onset, or inhibition of aberrant activity of
certain cell-types (monocytes, B-cells, and mast cells).
                                                  22

 [01891 "Treatment" or "treating" means any treatment of a disease in a patient, including:
         a)     preventing the disease, that is, causing the clinical symptoms of
the disease not to develop;
         b)     inhibiting the disease;
         c)     slowing or arresting the development of clinical symptoms;
and/or
         d)     relieving the disease, that is, causing the regression of clinical
symptoms.
[01901 "Patient" refers to an animal, such as a mammal, that has been or will be the object of
treatment, observation or experiment. The methods described herein may be useful in both
human therapy and veterinary applications. In some embodiments, the patient is a mammal;
in some embodiments the patient is human; and in some embodiments the patient is chosen
from cats and dogs.

General Syntheses:
[02051 The compounds of the invention may be prepared using methods disclosed herein and
routine modifications thereof which will be apparent given the disclosure herein and methods
well known in the art. Conventional and well-known synthetic methods may be used in
addition to the teachings herein. The synthesis of typical compounds described herein, e.g.
compounds having structures described by one or more of Formula I, may be accomplished
as described in the following examples.
[02061 Typical embodiments of compounds in accordance with the present invention may be
synthesized using the general reaction scheme described below. It will be apparent given the
description herein that the general schemes may be altered by substitution of the starting
materials with other materials having similar structures to result in products that are
correspondingly different. Descriptions of syntheses follow to provide numerous examples
of how the starting materials may vary to provide corresponding products. Given a desired
product for which the substituent groups are defined, the necessary starting materials
generally may be determined by inspection.
[0207] Starting materials are typically obtained from commercial sources or synthesized
using published methods.     For synthesizing compounds which are embodiments of the
present invention, inspection of the structure of the compound to be synthesized will provide
the identity of each substituent group. The identity of the final product will generally render
apparent the identity of the necessary starting materials by a simple process of inspection,
given the examples herein.
                                                27

 [02081 As a general method, the compounds of the invention are typically synthesized by
reacting a di-halogeniated core (A) with an amino derivative of the desired R' moiety (B) to
provide an R1 substituted intermediate (C). This intermediate (C) is then reacted with an
appropriately substituted boronic acid or dioxaborolane derivative (D), thereby coupling the
desired R2 moieity onto the R] coupled core. When the reaction is substantially complete, the
product of Formula I is isolated by conventional means.

[0209]          Referring to Reaction Scheme 1, Step 1, a solution of a compound (B) in a
polar solvent such as N,N-dimethylformamide is added an excess (such as about 1.3
equivalents) to a compound (A), where L' and L2 and leaving groups which may be the same
or different such as bromide and/or chloride. An organic base such as NN
diisopropylethylamine is added and the mixture is stirred at about 80 'C- 120 'C for about
12-24 hours. The product, compound (C), is isolated and optionally purified.
102101          Referring to Reaction Scheme 1, Step 2, an excess of compound (D) (such as
about 1.1 equivalents) and compound (C) are taken up in an aqueous solution of base (such
as 1M sodium carbonate) and an inert solvent such as 1,4-dioxane. The reaction mixture is
sparged with nitrogen and stirred for about 5-20 min. The resulting mixture is treated with
                                                   28

about 0.1 equivalent of tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(O) and reacted under
microwave irradiation at about 110 'C to 135 'C for about 30 min to an hour. The resulting
product, a compound of Formula I, is isolated and optionally purified.
[02111 Compounds of formulas (B) and (D) may be commercially obtained or may be
synthesized de novo. It will be appreciated that various R subsitutents can be modified or
added either before or after the addition of the R' and/or R 2 moieties. For example, in certain
embodiments, the R2 moiety may be coupled to the core before addition of the R, substituent.
Also, in the case where the Ri substituent contains a heteroaryl ring, the ring may be
synthesized and cyclized before or after addition of the R' portion.
[02121 It will also be appreciated that the addition of any substituent may result in the
production of a number of isomeric products any or all of which may be isolated and purified
using conventional techniques.
Optional Core Synthesis
[02131 When the core compound (A) is synthesized de novo, the R 3 components of the
compounds are typically established by selecting the appropriate reactants for core synthesis.
Additional modification to provide a desired R3 substituent may be introduced using
conventional techniques as illustrated in the examples that follow.

Pharmaceutical Compositions and Administration
[0235] Dosage levels of the order, for example, of from 0.1 mg to 140 mg per kilogram of
body weight per day can be useful in the treatment of the above-indicated conditions (0.5 mg
to 7 g per patient per day). The amount of active ingredient that may be combined with the
vehicle to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host treated and the
particular mode of administration. Dosage unit forms will generally contain from 1 mg to 500
mg of an active ingredient.
[0236] Frequency of dosage may also vary depending on the compound used and the
particular disease treated. In some embodiments, for example, for the treatment of an allergic
disorder and/or autoimmune and/or inflammatory disease, a dosage regimen of 4 times daily
or less is used. In some embodiments, a dosage regimen of I or 2 times daily is used. It will
be understood, however, that the specific dose level for any particular patient will depend
upon a variety of factors including the activity of the specific compound employed, the age,
body weight, general health, sex, diet, time of administration, route of administration, and
rate of excretion, drug combination and the severity of the particular disease in the patient
undergoing therapy.
10237] A labeled form of a chemical entity described herein can be used as a diagnostic for
identifying and/or obtaining compounds that have the function of modulating an activity of a

 enhancers, solubilizers and adjuvants. The pharmaceutical compositions may be
 administered alone or in combination with other therapeutic agents. Such compositions are
prepared in a manner well known in the pharmaceutical art (see, e.g., Remington's
 Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mace Publishing Co., Philadelphia, PA 17th Ed. (1985); and
Modern Pharmaceutics, Marcel Dekker, Inc. 3rd Ed. (G.S. Banker & C.T. Rhodes, Eds.)
 [02401 The pharmaceutical compositions may be administered in either single or multiple
doses by any of the accepted modes of administration of agents having similar utilities, for
 example as described in those patents and patent applications incorporated by reference,
including rectal, buccal, intranasal and transdermal routes, by intra-arterial injection,
intravenously, intraperitoneally, parenterally, intramuscularly, subcutaneously, orally,
topically, as an inhalant, or via an impregnated or coated device such as a stent, for example,
or an artery-inserted cylindrical polymer.
 102411 One mode for administration is parenteral, particularly by injection. The forms in
which the novel compositions of the present invention may be incorporated for administration
by injection include aqueous or oil suspensions, or emulsions, with sesame oil, corn oil,
cottonseed oil, or peanut oil, as well as elixirs, mannitol, dextrose, or a sterile aqueous
solution, and similar pharmaceutical vehicles. Aqueous solutions in saline are also
conventionally used for injection, but less preferred in the context of the present invention.
Ethanol, glycerol, propylene glycol, liquid polyethylene glycol, and the like (and suitable
mixtures thereof), cyclodextrin derivatives, and vegetable oils may also be employed. The
proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating, such as lecithin, by
the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersion and by the use of
surfactants. The prevention of the action of microorganisms can be brought about by various
                                                  34

 antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, sorbic acid,
thimerosal, and the like.
 [0242] Sterile injectable solutions are prepared by incorporating a compound according to the
present invention in the required amount in the appropriate solvent with various other
ingredients as enumerated above, as required, followed by filtered sterilization. Generally,
dispersions are prepared by incorporating the various sterilized active ingredients into a
 sterile vehicle which contains the basic dispersion medium and the required other ingredients
from those enumerated above. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile
injectable solutions, the preferred methods of preparation are vacuum-drying and freeze
drying techniques which yield a powder of the active ingredient plus any additional desired
ingredient from a previously sterile-filtered solution thereof.
 [02431 Oral administration is another route for administration of compounds in accordance
with the invention. Administration may be via capsule or enteric coated tablets, or the like.
In making the pharmaceutical compositions that include at least one compound described
herein, the active ingredient is usually diluted by an excipient and/or enclosed within such a
carrier that can be in the form of a capsule, sachet, paper or other container. When the
excipient serves as a diluent, it can be in the form of a solid, semi-solid, or liquid material (as
above), which acts as a vehicle, carrier or medium for the active ingredient. Thus, the
compositions can be in the form of tablets, pills, powders, lozenges, sachets, cachets, elixirs,
suspensions, emulsions, solutions, syrups, aerosols (as a solid or in a liquid medium),
ointments containing, for example, up to 10% by weight of the active compound, soft and
hard gelatin capsules, sterile injectable solutions, and sterile packaged powders.
[0244] Some examples of suitable excipients include lactose, dextrose, sucrose, sorbitol,
mannitol, starches, gum acacia, calcium phosphate, alginates, tragacanth, gelatin, calcium
silicate, microcrystalline cellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone, cellulose, sterile water, syrup, and
methyl cellulose. The formulations can additionally include: lubricating agents such as tale,
magnesium stearate, and mineral oil; wetting agents; emulsifying and suspending agents;
preserving agents such as methyl and propylhydroxy-benzoates; sweetening agents; and
flavoring agents.
10245] The compositions of the invention can be formulated so as to provide quick, sustained
or delayed release of the active ingredient after administration to the patient by employing
procedures known in the art. Controlled release drug delivery systems for oral administration
                                                  35

include osmotic pump systems and dissolutional systems containing polymer-coated
reservoirs or drug-polymer matrix formulations. Examples of controlled release systems are
given in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,845,770; 4,326,525; 4,902514; and 5,616,345. Another
fonnulation for use in the methods of the present invention employs transdermal delivery
devices ("patches"). Such transdermal patches may be used to provide continuous or
discontinuous infusion of the compounds of the present invention in controlled amounts. The
construction and use of transdermal patches for the delivery of phannaceutical agents is well
known in the art. See, e.g., U.S. Patent Nos. 5,023,252, 4,992,445 and 5,001,139. Such
patches may be constructed for continuous, pulsatile, or on demand delivery of
pharmaceutical agents.
[02461 The compositions are preferably formulated in a unit dosage form. The term "unit
dosage forms" refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages for human
subjects and other mammals, each unit containing a predetennined quantity of active material
calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect, in association with a suitable
pharmaceutical excipient (e.g., a tablet, capsule, ampoule). The compounds are generally
administered in a pharmaceutically effective amount. Preferably, for oral administration,
each dosage unit contains from 1 mg to 2 g of a compound described herein, and for
parenteral administration, preferably from 0.1 to 700 mg of a compound a compound
described herein. It will be understood, however, that the amount of the compound actually
administered usually will be determined by a physician, in the light of the relevant
circumstances, including the condition to be treated, the chosen route of administration, the
actual compound administered and its relative activity, the age, weight, and response of the
individual patient, the severity of the patient's symptoms, and the like.
[02471 For preparing solid compositions such as tablets, the principal active ingredient is
mixed with a pharmaceutical excipient to form a solid preformulation composition containing
a homogeneous mixture of a compound of the present invention. When referring to these
preformulation compositions as homogeneous, it is meant that the active ingredient is
dispersed evenly throughout the composition so that the composition may be readily
subdivided into equally effective unit dosage forms such as tablets, pills and capsules.
[0248] The tablets or pills of the present invention may be coated or otherwise compounded
to provide a dosage form affording the advantage of prolonged action, or to protect from the
acid conditions of the stomach. For example, the tablet or pill can comprise an inner dosage
and an outer dosage component, the latter being in the form of an envelope over the former.
                                                  36

The two components can be separated by an enteric layer that serves to resist disintegration in
the stomach and permit the inner component to pass intact into the duodenum or to be
delayed in release. A variety of materials can be used for such enteric layers or coatings,
such materials including a number of polymeric acids and mixtures of polymeric acids with
such materials as shellac, cetyl alcohol, and cellulose acetate.
[02491 Compositions for inhalation or insufflation include solutions and suspensions in
pharmaceutically acceptable, aqueous or organic solvents, or mixtures thereof, and powders.
The liquid or solid compositions may contain suitable pharmaceutically acceptable excipients
as described supra. Preferably, the compositions are administered by the oral or nasal
respiratory route for local or systemic effect. Compositions in preferably pharmaceutically
acceptable solvents may be nebulized by use of inert gases. Nebulized solutions may be
inhaled directly from the nebulizing device or the nebulizing device may be attached to a
facemask tent, or intermittent positive pressure breathing machine. Solution, suspension, or
powder compositions may be administered, preferably orally or nasally, from devices that
deliver the formulation in an appropriate manner.

 [03191 The following compounds were prepared using procedures similar to those described
above Those of ordinary skill in the art of organic synthesis will recognize when starting
materials or reaction conditions should be varied to obtain the desired compound.
[03201 MS data reported in this example was obtained as follows: MS conditions:
Electrospray MS is performed on a MICROMASS LCT equipped with a LockSpray source
for accurate mass measurements. Spectra are acquired in positive ion mode from 100-1000
Da at an acquisition rate of 1 spectrum/0.9s with a 0.Is interscan delay. The instrument is
tuned for a resolution of 5000 (FWHM). Every 5" scan is taken from the reference position
of the Lockspray source. Leucine enkephalin (556.2771 [M+H]*) is used as the reference, or
lock mass.
[03211 Syk -40ptM data was obtained according to the method disclosed in Example 18
which follows and represents IC50 values calculated using a 40ptM ATP solution.

                                     Biochemical Syk Assay
[0322] A generalized procedure for one standard biochemical Syk Kinase Assay that can be
used to test compounds disclosed in this application is as follows:
[0323] A master mix minus Syk enzyme is prepared containing IX Cell Signaling kinase
buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mM beta-glycerophosphate, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1 mM
Na 3 VO 4 , 10 mM MgCl 2 ), 0.5 pM Promega PTK Biotinylated peptide substrate 1, 0.0 1%
casein, 0.01% Triton-X100, and 0.25% glycerol. A master mix plus Syk enzyme is prepared
containing IX Cell Signaling kinase buffer, 0.5 pM PTK Biotinylated peptide substrate 1,
0.01% casein, 0.01% Triton-X100, 0.25% glycerol and 0.4 ng/well Syk enzyme. Syk enzyme
is purchased from Cell Signaling Technologies, expressed in baculovirus and is an N
terminally GST-tagged full length human wildtype Syk (accession number NM-00377).
[0324] The Syk protein is purified in one step using glutathione-agarose. The purity of the
final protein preparation is assessed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining. A solution of
200 gM ATP is prepared in water and adjusted to pH 7.4 with IN NaOH. A quantity of 1.25
pL of compounds in 5% DMSO is transferred to a 96-well % area Costar polystyrene plate.
[03251 Compounds are tested singly and with an 11-point dose-responsive curve (starting
concentration is 10 - 1 pM; 1:2 dilution). A quantity of 18.75 piL of master mix minus
enzyme (as a negative control) and master mix plus enzyme is transferred to appropriate
                                                108

wells in 96-well % area Costar polystyrene plate. 5 pL of 200 pM ATP is added to that
mixture in the 96-well /2 area Costar polystyrene plate for final ATP concentration of 40 pM.
 [03261 The reaction is allowed to incubate for 1 hour at room temperature. The reaction is
stopped with Perkin Elmer IX detection buffer containing 30 mM EDTA, 80 nM SA-APC,
and 4 nM PT66 Ab. The plate is read using time-resolved fluorescence with a Perkin Elmer
Envision using excitation filter 330 nm, emission filter 665 nm, and 2      emission filter 615
nm. IC50 values are subsequently calculated using a linear regression algorithm.

 10327] Another generalized procedure for a standard cellular Syk Kinase Assay that can be
used to test compounds disclosed in this application is as follows:
 [0328] Ramos cells are serum starved at 2 x 106 cells/ml in serum-free RPMI for 1 hour in an
upright TI 75 Falcon TC flask. Cells are centrifuged (1100 rpm x 5 min) and incubated at a
density of 0.5x10 7 cells/ml in the presence of test compound or DMSO controls for 1 hr at 37
'C. Cells are then stimulated by incubating with 10 pg/ml anti-human IgM F(ab) 2 for 5
minutes at 37 'C. Cells are pelleted, lysed in 40 pl cell lysis buffer, and mixed with
Invitrogen SDS-PAGE loading buffer. 20 l of cell lysate for each sample are subject to
SDS-PAGE and western blotting with anti-phosphoBLNK(Tyr96) antibody (Cell Signaling
Technology #3 601) to assess Syk activity and anti-Syk antibody (BD Transduction Labs
#611116) to control for total protein load in each lysate. The images are detected using
fluorescent secondary detection systems and the LiCor Odyssey software.

used to test compounds disclosed in this application is as follows:
[03301 B-cells are purified from spleens of 8-16 week old Balb/c mice using a B-cell
isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotech, Cat # 130-090-862). Test compounds are diluted in 0.25%
DMSO and incubated with 2.5 x 105 purified mouse splenic B-cells for 30 min prior to
addition of 10 pg/ml of an anti-mouse IgM antibody (Southern Biotechnology Associates Cat
# 1022-01) in a final volume of 100 l. Following 24 hr incubation, 1 ptCi 3 H-thymidine is
                                                109

 added and plates are incubated an additional 36 hr prior to harvest using the manufacturer's
 protocol for SPA[ 3H] thymidine uptake assay system (Amersham Biosciences # RPNQ
 0130). SPA-bead based fluorescence is counted in a microbeta counter (Wallace Triplex
 1450, Perkin Elmer).

                                       BMMC degranulation
[0335] A generalized procedure for a standard assay for bone-marrow derived mouse mast
cell (BMMC) degranulation that can be used to test compounds disclosed in this application
is as follows:
[0336] Bone-marrow derived mast cells are cultured for >4 weeks with IL-3 (1 Ong/ml) and
SCF (1 Ong/ml). The cells are determined to be > 90% cKit*/FceRI* by FACS analysis at the
time of use. Cells (6 x 107 cells/50 ml) are serum-starved in a T150 tissue culture flask for
16h in the absence of IL-3 and SCF containing IgEa-DNP at 1 ug/ml. Overnight sensitized
cells are washed twice in Tyrodes buffer and resuspended to 5 x 106 cells/ml. 5 x 105 cells
(100pl) are plated in a 96 well microtiter plate (Falcon 353072) and test compounds are
serially diluted to a final concentration 0.25% DMSO in the plate for 1 hr at 37'C under an
atmosphere containing 5% CO 2. Wells are treated with a DNP-BSA antigen challenge (50
ng/ml) and incubated for and additional 30 min at 37"C. Supernatants are assayed for
hexosamimidase release versus control wells. Cell pellets are simultaneously lysed and assed
for total hexosarnimidase release to calculate specific release. Dose-response curves are
generated using 4- parameter logistical fit and IC50s calculated.

[03371 The following is a procedure for a standard PCA model used for measuring in vivo
IgE anti-DNP Ab sensitization and DNP-BSA antigen for triggering mast cell degranulation
and release of immune regulators that cause acute vessel permeability monitored by Evan's
blue dye into the inflamed area in the mouse ear.
10338] Reagents: Anti-DNP IgE: is supplied as 1.2 mg/ml in a phosphate buffered solution
with BSA for additional protein and azide for sterility. This is diluted 1:100 in sterile PBS as
a 12 ptg/ml working stock that can be further diluted in PBS to the appropriate concentration
                                                111

for injection. A further 1:5 dilution gives a final 1:500 solution at 2.4 ng/tL. (10 pL/ear    = 24
ng). Sterile PBS alone is used as a negative control.
 [03391 Evan 's blue dye: A 2% stock in saline is sterile filtered and diluted 1:1 with DNP
BSA saline solution for a final concentration of 1% for injection.
 [03401 DNP-BSA: is made up at 4mg/mL in sterile ddH 20. It is further diluted 1:1 with sterile
saline prior to use. This solution or a further dilution in saline is diluted 1:1 with 2% Evan's
Blue in sterile saline that has been filtered through a 0.02ptm filter and refiltered prior to
injection. For these experiments a final solution of 0.5 mg/ml of DNP-BSA in 1% Evans blue
is used, and aliquots of 200 pL are injected into the tail vein.
General PCA Protocol Using Intradermal Ear Sensitization
 [03411 1) On day 0, animals anesthetized with isofluorine are passively sensitized by
intradermal injections of IgE anti-DNP using a 29-gauge insulin syringe. By convention, the
right ear receives 10 pL intradermal injection of anti-DNP IgE, while the left ear receives
PBS. 2) 20hr post sensitization, antigen challenge is administered by tail i.v. injection of
DNP-BSA in 200 pL of 1% Evan's blue dye solution in saline. Tails are immersed in warm
water prior to iv injection. 3) 30 minutes to 2 hr prior to this antigen challenge, drug is
delivered se or po in 10% EtOH/ 20% cremaphor/ 70% saline. 4) Animals are sacrifice by
CO 2 inhalation 30-60 min post antigen challenge and ears are removed for extraction of
Evan's blue dye in 500 pL of formamide overnight at 65'C. 5) Blood is obtained by cardiac
puncture just prior to final cervical dislocation and processed for plasma to provide PK
analysis. 6) Evan's blue dye is quantified by reading absorbency of 200 pL of extracted
solution in microtiter plates at 620 nm.
Study Design of Experiment
[03421 Each animal has one anti-DNP IgE sensitized ear (right ear by convention) and one
PBS control ear (left ear by convention). Groups 1-8: represent the vehicle and compound
testing arms; Group 9: represents the non-antigen negative control; Group 10: represents the
non-sensitized challenged negative control; Group 11: represents the non-antigen challenged,
non-sensitized negative control group (Groups 9-11 represent negative controls for
background levels only and require only minimal number of animals per group.)
