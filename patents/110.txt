SURGICAL STAPLING INSTRUMENT WITH CURVED END EFFECTOR
BACKGROUND
Technical Field
[0001] The present disclosure relates generally to a surgical instrument and, more specifically,
to a surgical stapling instrument for clamping, and joining and/or cutting tissue.
Background of Related Art
[0002] Certain surgical stapling instruments are used for applying rows of staples through
compressed living tissue. These surgical stapling instruments are employed, for example, for
fastening tissue or organs prior to transection or resection or during anastomoses. In some
cases, these surgical stapling instruments are utilized for occluding organs in thoracic and
abdominal procedures.
[0003] Typically, such surgical stapling instruments include an anvil assembly, a cartridge
assembly for supporting an array of surgical staples, an approximation mechanism for
approximating the cartridge and anvil assemblies, an alignment or guide pin assembly for
capturing tissue between the cartridge and anvil assemblies and/or for maintaining alignment
between the cartridge and anvil assemblies during approximation and firing, and a firing
mechanism for ejecting the surgical staples from the cartridge assembly.
[0004] In use, a surgeon initially advances the alignment pin assembly and subsequently
approximates the anvil and cartridge assemblies. In some surgical stapling instruments, the
alignment pin is automatically advanced in response to approximation of the anvil and cartridge
assemblies. Next, the surgeon fires the surgical stapling instrument to place staples in tissue.
Optionally, the surgeon may use the same surgical stapling instrument or a separate device to
cut tissue positioned adjacent or between the rows of staples. In some instances, the surgical
stapling instrument includes a knife which cuts tissue as the staples are fired.
[0005] In certain procedures, it may be difficult to access the target organ or tissue for resection
and application of rows of staples. It would be desirable to provide a surgical stapling
instrument that is configured to improve access to hard to reach areas, and one having improved
maneuverability.

OBJECT
[0006] It is an object of the present invention to at least substantially satisfy the above desire.
SUMMARY
[0007] The present disclosure relates to a surgical stapling instrument comprising a handle
assembly, an elongated body portion extending from the handle assembly and defining a
longitudinal axis, and an end effector supported on a distal portion of the elongated body
portion. The end effector includes a curved housing having a base portion and a jaw portion, a
curved anvil assembly supported on the jaw portion, and a curved cartridge assembly supported
on the base portion. The cartridge assembly defining first and second arrays of staples receiving
slots. The first array of staple receiving slots includes three rows of staples and the second array
of staple receiving slots includes two rows of staples. A height of the staples in each of the rows
of three rows of staples of the first array of staple receiving slots is different. The base portion
is secured to the distal portion of the elongated body portion.
[0008] In embodiments, the cartridge assembly includes a staple cartridge and a tissue guard
extendable from the staple cartridge. The end effector may include a tissue guard assembly
configured to advance the tissue guard into contact with the anvil assembly when the cartridge
assembly is secured to the housing of the end effector.
[0009] The surgical stapling instrument of the present disclosure may further include an
indicator feature on the elongated body portion for indicating to a clinician the position of the
cartridge assembly relative to the anvil assembly. An indicator feature may instead, or
additionally, be formed on the housing of the end effector. Embodiments of the surgical
stapling instrument include an indicator mechanism disposed within the handle assembly for
indicating to a clinician the position of the cartridge assembly relative to the anvil assembly.
The indicator mechanism may be a wheel member rotatably supported within the handle
assembly. The wheel member may include first, second and third marks configured to indicate
the position of the cartridge assembly in relation to the anvil assembly.
[0010] In embodiments, the cartridge assembly defines a knife receiving slot between the first
array of staple receiving slots and the second array of staple receiving slots. The first array of
staple receiving slots may be disposed radially outwardly of the knife receiving slot. A height of

                                                    3
the staples in a row of the first array of staple receiving slots closest to the knife receiving slot
may be shorter than a height of the staples in a row of the first array of stapling receiving slots
furthest from the knife receiving slot.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS
[0031] Embodiments of the presently disclosed surgical stapling instrument are described in
detail with reference to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals designate corresponding

                                                   5
elements in each of the several views. In the drawings and the description that follows, the term
"proximal" refers to the end of the surgical stapling instrument that is closer to the clinician,
whereas the term "distal" refers to the end of the surgical stapling instrument that is farther from
the clinician. In addition, the term clinician is used generally to refer to medical personnel
including doctors, nurses, and support personnel.
[0032] It should be appreciated that the instrument described and illustrated herein is configured
to fire surgical staples against an anvil surface; however, aspects of the present disclosure are
equally applicable with other forms of staples, fasteners, clips, as well as two part fasteners,
made of metallic or polymeric material.
[0033] Embodiments of the presently disclosed surgical stapling instruments include a curved
end effector having a curved anvil assembly and a curved cartridge assembly. The curved
configuration of the end effector improves the capability of the instrument to access surgical
sites within a patient, and improves the ability of the instrument to clamp and/or to join
particular tissue within the body during surgical procedures. The curved end effector may also
improve visualization of a surgical site and allow more room for a clinician to manipulate tissue
or the end effector within the body. Additionally, the curved end effector may increase the
effective tissue cutting length (as measured along a knife slot) as compared to a linear end
effector. In embodiments, the surgical stapling instruments include an indicator for providing
the clinician with an indication of the position of the cartridge assembly of the surgical stapling
instrument, e.g., open, partially clamped, clamped.
[0034] With reference now to FIGS. 1 and 2, a surgical stapling instrument according to an
embodiment of the present disclosure is shown generally as surgical stapling instrument 100.
The surgical stapling instrument 100 includes a handle assembly 110 having a stationary handle
or base 112, a trigger member 114 pivotally secured relative to the stationary handle 112, and an
elongated body portion 116 extending distally from the stationary handle 112. An end effector
150 is secured to a distal portion of the elongated body portion 116 and includes a cartridge
assembly 160 and an anvil assembly 170. A thumb button 118 is slidably positioned on each
side of the stationary handle 112 of the handle assembly 110. The thumb buttons 118 are
movable to manually advance an alignment pin 136. A release button 122a of a release
mechanism 120 (FIG. 3) is positioned on the proximal portion of the stationary handle 112 and
is depressible to allow the cartridge assembly 170 to automatically return from a fully

                                                  6
approximated or clamped position, disposed adjacent to the anvil assembly 160 (see, for
example, FIG. 20), to an open position, spaced from the anvil assembly 160 (see, for example,
FIG. 18).
[0035] The structure and function of the handle assembly 110 of the surgical stapling instrument
100 will only be described to the extent necessary to fully disclose particular aspects of the
present disclosure. For a detailed description of an exemplary handle assembly, please refer to
commonly owned U.S. Patent No. 6,817,508 ("the '508 patent"), the content of which is hereby
incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.
[0036] With reference also to FIG. 3, the stationary handle 112 of the handle assembly 110 of
the surgical stapling instrument 100 is formed from a pair of half-sections 1 12a, 1 12b. A pair of
spaced frame members 124a, 124b extends between the half-sections 112a, 112b and a housing
152 of the end effector 150. A pair of clamp slide members 126a, 126b, an alignment pin
pusher 128, and a thrust bar 130 are slidably supported between the frame members 124a, 124b
for movement between retracted and advanced positions in response to movement of the trigger
member 114 through an approximation stroke and/or a firing stroke, as described in the '508
patent.
[0037] The clamp slide members 126a, 126b form part of an approximation mechanism of the
surgical stapling instrument 100. As will be described in further detail below, a distal portion of
each clamp slide member 126a, 126b includes a head portion 132. The head portions 132 are
configured to releasable support the cartridge assembly 170 of the end effector 150.
[0038] The alignment pin pusher 128 and thrust bar 130 are slidably disposed between the
clamp slide members 126a, 126b. The alignment pin pusher 128 slidably receives the thrust bar
130 and is configured to engage an alignment pin 136 such that when the alignment pin pusher
128 is moved to an advanced position, the alignment pin 136 is advanced from within cartridge
assembly 170 into an opening 163a (FIG. 8) of the anvil assembly 160. The thumb buttons 118
are fastened to posts 128a of the alignment pin pusher 128 to facilitate manual actuation of the
alignment pin pusher 128. The thrust bar 130 is slidably positioned within an elongated slot
(not shown) defined within the alignment pin pusher 128 and includes an engagement head 128a
configured to engage a knife pusher 176 of the cartridge assembly 170.

                                                  7
[0039] An actuation assembly 140 is operably disposed within the stationary handle 112 of the
handle assembly 110 of the surgical stapling instrument 100 and includes a bi-linkage assembly
142 having a front link 142a and a rear link 142b, a bell crank 144, a clamping pawl 146a, and a
firing pawl 146b. The release mechanism 120 is operably connected to the actuation assembly
140 and includes the release button 122a and a release lever 122b. Through actuation of the
trigger member 114, the actuation assembly 140 operates to individually advance the clamp
slide members 126a, 126b to move the cartridge assembly 170 towards the clamped position
(see, for example, FIG. 20), and advance the thrust bar 130, to eject staples "S" from the
cartridge assembly 170. The release mechanism 120 operates to permit return of the cartridge
assembly 170 to an open position.
[0040] For a detailed description of the structure and function of an exemplary handle actuation
assembly and an exemplary release mechanism, please refer to the '508 patent, the content of
which was previously incorporated by reference.
[0041] With reference to FIGS. 4-6 , the end effector 150 of the surgical stapling instrument 100
(FIG. 1) includes a housing 152 having a base portion 154 and an L-shaped jaw portion 156
extending from the base portion 154. Although shown secured to the distal portion of the
elongated body portion 116 of the handle assembly 110 by rivets 117 (FIGS. 5 and 6), it is
envisioned that the housing 152 of the end effector 150 may be secured to a distal portion of the
body portion 116 of the handle assembly 110 in any suitable manner, e.g., welding, mechanical
fasteners. The anvil assembly 160 is supported on the jaw portion 156 of the housing 152 and
the cartridge assembly 170 is releasably supported within the base portion 154 of the housing
152.
[0042] The housing 152 of the end effector 150 includes a substantially curved, C-like, or hook
shaped cross-section. In embodiments, and as shown, the end effector 150 includes a first radius
of curvature and a second radius of curvature. The first and second radii of curvature may be
increased or decreased to suit a particular procedure and/or to accommodate a particular patient.
In embodiments, the curvature of the end effector 150 is formed by substantially linear sections
of the end effector 150. As will be described in detail below, each of the anvil assembly 160
and the cartridge assembly 170 include a curved configuration corresponding to the curved
configuration of the housing 152 of the end effector 150.

                                                  8
[0043] As noted above, the curved configuration of the end effector 150 improves the capability
of the instrument to access surgical sites within a patient, and improves the ability of the
instrument to clamp and/or to join particular tissue within the body during surgical procedures.
The curved end effector 150 may also improve visualization of a surgical site and allow more
room for a clinician to manipulate tissue or an end effector of the instrument within the body.
Additionally, the curved end effector 150 may increase the effective tissue cutting length (as
measured along a knife slot) as compared to a linear end effector.
[0044] With particular reference to FIG. 7, the jaw portion 156 of the housing 152 of the end
effector 150 supports an interlock assembly 80. The interlock assembly 180 prevents firing of
the surgical stapling instrument 100 with a spent cartridge assembly, i.e., a cartridge assembly in
which the staples "S" have already been fired, until new cartridge assembly (not shown) is
replaced. The interlock assembly 180 includes a holder 182, a lock member 184 pivotally
received within the holder 182, and a spring 186 biasing the lock member 184 to an extended
position (not shown). The interlock assembly 180 prevents readvancement of the thrust bar 130
of the handle assembly 110 when a spent cartridge assembly 170 is supported within the
housing 152 of the end effector 150. For a detailed description of the structure and function of
an exemplary interlock assembly, please refer to the '508 patent.
[0045] The jaw portion 156 of the housing 152 of the end effector 150 also supports a tissue
guard assembly 190 for advancing a tissue guard 178 from the cartridge assembly 170 to prevent
over insertion of tissue between the anvil assembly 160 and the cartridge assembly 170, e.g., to
prevent tissue from extending below the staple line of the cartridge assembly 170. The tissue
guard assembly 190 includes a pusher pin 192, a pusher member 194 mounted on a distal
portion of the pusher pin 192, and a spring 196 received about the pusher pin 192 for biasing the
pusher pin 192 distally. Although shown as separate components, it is envisioned that the
pusher pin 192 and the pusher member 194 may be integrally formed, e.g., monolithic. As will
be described in further detail below, the pusher pin 192 is maintained in a retracted position by
the lock member 184 of the interlock assembly 180. Loading of a cartridge assembly 170 within
the housing 152 of the end effector 150 depresses the lock member 184, thereby releasing the
pusher pin 192. The pusher member 194 on the pusher pin 192 engages the tissue guard 178,
causing advancement of the tissue guard 178 into engagement with the anvil assembly 160.

                                                   9
 [0046] With reference back to FIG. 4, the anvil assembly 160 of the end effector 150 includes a
base plate 162 and an anvil member 164. The base plate 162 and anvil member 164 define the
same curved profile as the jaw portion 156 of the housing 152 of the end effector 150. In
embodiments, the anvil member 164 is secured to the jaw portion 154 of the housing 152 by a
rivet 157. The base plate 162 is supported on the jaw portion 156 and is received between the
jaw portion 156 and the anvil member 164. The base plate 162 is clamped to the jaw portion
 154 of the housing 152 by the anvil member 164.
 [0047] With particular reference to FIG. 8, the anvil member 164 defines a longitudinal slot 163
configured for receipt of a knife member 176a (FIG. 4) of the cartridge assembly 170 (FIG. 4).
A first opening 163a is formed on a first portion of the longitudinal slot 163 and is configured to
receive a distal portion of the alignment pin 136 (FIG. 4). A second opening 163b (FIG. 2) is
formed on a second portion of the longitudinal slot 163 and is configured to receive a distal
portion of a tissue guard 178 (FIG. 4).
 [0048] The anvil member 164 defines first and second sets of staple pockets 165a, 165b formed
in the surface of the anvil member 164. The position of the first and second sets of staple
pockets 165a, 165b correspond to the position of the first and second arrays of staple receiving
slots 171a, 171b, respectively, of a staple cartridge 172 of the cartridge assembly 170. As will
be described in further detail below with regards to the cartridge assembly 170, the anvil
member 164 includes three rows of pockets in the first set of staple pockets 165a formed on a
first or radial outward side of the longitudinal slot 163, and two rows of pockets in the second
set of staple pockets 165b formed on a second or radially inward side of the longitudinal slot
 163.
 [0049] With reference again to FIG. 4, the cartridge assembly 170 of the end effector 150 of the
surgical stapling instrument 100 (FIG. 1) includes the staple cartridge 172 including the same
curved profile as the base portion 156 of the housing 152 of the end effector 152. As described
above with regards to the housing 152 of the end effector 150, in embodiments, the staple
cartridge 172 includes first and second radii of curvature. As also described above with regards
to the housing 152, the curvature of the staple cartridge 172 may be formed by substantially
linear sections of the staple cartridge 172. In embodiments, a distal portion of the staple
cartridge 172 may be curved in substantially hook-like manner to assist in manipulation of
tissue.

                                                  10
[0050] The staple cartridge 172 defines first and second arrays of staple receiving slots 171 a,
171b for receiving staples "S", a knife receiving slot 173, a first opening 173a formed on a first
portion of the knife receiving slot 173 configured to receive the alignment pin 136, and a second
opening 173b formed on a second portion of the knife receiving slot 163 configured to receive
the tissue guard 178. In embodiments, the first array of staple receiving slots 171a is formed
radially outwardly of the knife receiving slot 173 and includes three rows of slots, while the
second array of staple receiving slots 171b is formed radially inwardly of the knife receiving slot
171 and includes two rows of slots. Other configurations of the staple receiving slots 171 a are
envisioned.
[0051] As shown in FIGS. 9 and 10, in embodiments, the staple cartridge 172 includes a stepped
tissue contacting surface 172a. In embodiments, and as shown, the staples "S" (FIG. 3) in each
row of the first array of staple receiving slots 171 a have a height different from the staples "S"
in an adjacent row of the first array of staple receiving slots 171a. As shown, the height of the
staples "S" in each of the rows of the first array of staple receiving slots 171a increase in height
the further the row is from the knife receiving slot 173. This stepped configuration is described
in detail in commonly owned U.S. Patent No. 7,407,075, the content of which is incorporated
herein by reference in its entirety. Although shown including the stepped configuration, it is
envisioned that embodiments of the cartridge assembly may include alternative numbers and/or
configurations of staples.
[0052] Referring also to FIG. 11, the staple cartridge 172 is configured for operable engagement
with the clamp slide members 126a, 126b (only one shown). As described above, the clamp
slide members 126a, 126b extend from the handle assembly 110 (FIG. 1) and support the
cartridge assembly 170. The head portion 132 of each clamp slide member 132 defines a pair of
alignment features 134 to facilitate alignment of the cartridge assembly 170 within the clamp
slide members 126a, 126b, and a tab 136 to provide a snap fit connection with the clamp slide
members 126a, 126b. Although shown with a pair of alignment features 134 and a single tab
136, it is envisioned that the head portion 132 of the clamp slide members 126a, 126b may
include any number of alignment features 134 and/or tabs 136 in any suitable configuration.
[0053] With reference now to FIGS. 12 and 13, a staple pusher assembly 174 is slidably
disposed within the staple cartridge 172 and engageable by the knife pusher 176. The staple
pusher assembly 174 includes a plurality of fingers 174a (FIG. 12), 174b (FIG. 13) configured

                                                 11
to be slidably received within respective staple receiving slots 171a, 171b (FIG. 11) of the staple
cartridge 172 of the cartridge assembly 170. The fingers 174a, 174b are positioned behind
staples "S" (FIG. 4) in respective staple receiving slots 171a, 171b such that advancement of the
staple pusher assembly 174 effects advancement of staples "S" from respective staple receiving
slots 171a, 171b and into contact with the anvil member 164 of the anvil assembly 160.
[0054] A knife member 176a extends distally from the knife pusher 176 and is disposed
proximally of the staple pusher assembly 174. The knife pusher 176 is configured to be engaged
by the thrust bar 130 and includes a plurality of clips 175 configured to engage tabs 130b
formed on a head portion 130a of the thrust bar 130. The clips 175 secure the knife pusher 176
to the thrust bar 130.
[0055] In operation, when the thrust bar 130 is advanced into engagement with the staple pusher
assembly 174, the tabs 130b formed on the head portion 130a of the thrust bar 130 are engaged
by the clips 175 on the knife pusher 176 to secure the knife pusher 176 to the thrust bar 130. In
this manner, when the thrust bar 130 is retracted following the formation of the staples "S"
(FIG. 4), the knife pusher 174 is retracted with the thrust bar 130. In some embodiments, the
staple pusher assembly 174 may be secured to the knife pusher 176 to permit simultaneous
retraction of the staple pusher assembly 174 with the knife pusher 176. Alternatively, and as
shown, the staple pusher assembly 174 is separate from the knife pusher 176 such that the knife
pusher 176 is retracted independently of the staple pusher assembly 174.
[0056] With reference to FIG. 14, as detailed above, the housing 152 of the end effector 150
supports the tissue guard assembly 190. Receipt of the cartridge assembly 170 within the base
portion 154 of the housing 152 causes the lock member 184 (FIG. 7) of the interlock assembly
180 (FIG. 7) to disengage from the push member 194 of the tissue guard assembly 190. Once
disengaged from the lock member 184 of the interlock assembly 180, the pusher member 194 is
moved distally by spring 196 of the tissue guard assembly 190. The pusher member 194
engages the tissue guard 178 disposed within the cartridge assembly 170 such that the tissue
guard 178 moves distally with the pusher pin 192 until a distal portion of the tissue guard 178
engages the anvil assembly 160. The tissue guard 178 prevents tissue to be stapled from
extending below the staple line of the anvil and cartridge assemblies 160, 170.

[0057] With reference to FIGS. 15-17, a surgical stapling instrument according to another
embodiment of the present disclosure, including an indicator feature 202, is shown generally as
surgical stapling instrument 200. It is envisioned that the indicator feature 202 can be
incorporated into the surgical stapling instruments described herein, and/or be modified for use
in surgical stapling instruments having different configurations. The surgical stapling
instrument 200 is substantially similar to the surgical stapling instrument 100 described
hereinabove, and will only be described to the extent necessary to fully disclose the indicator
feature 202. Although shown and described as being formed on only a single side of the
surgical stapler 200, it is envisioned that the indicator feature 202 may be included on both sides
of the surgical stapling instrument 200.
[0058] The surgical stapler 200 includes a first frame member 224 defining a longitudinal slot
225. A first clamp slide member 226 is visible through the longitudinal slot 225. An indicator
mark 227 is provided on the first clamp slide member 226a and is disposed such that the
indicator mark 227 is positioned at a proximal end of the longitudinal slot 225 when a cartridge
assembly 270 of the surgical stapler 200 is in a first or open condition. The first frame member
224 includes a first reference character, mark, and/ or symbol "M1" that is aligned with the
indicator mark 227 when the cartridge assembly 270 is in an open condition (FIG. 15) indicated
to the clinician that the cartridge assembly 270 is in the open condition. In embodiments, the
first reference character "M1" is the letter "0",representing "open."
[0059] During operation of the surgical stapler 200, the cartridge assembly 270 first moves
moved from the open position (FIG. 15) to a partially clamped position (FIG. 16) through
advancement of the first clamp slide member 226 in response to actuation of a trigger member
214. As the first clamp slide member 226 moves distally, the indicator mark 227 on the first
clamp slide member 226 moves distally within the longitudinal slot 225 of the first frame
member 224. The first frame member 224 includes a second reference character, mark, and/ or
symbol "M2" that aligns with the indicator mark 227 when the cartridge assembly 270 is in the
partially clamped position to indicate that the cartridge assembly 270 is in the partially clamped
position. In embodiments, the second reference character "M2" is the letters "PC", representing
"partially clamped" or "pre-clamped." At this point during a stapling procedure, in
embodiments, the trigger member 214 of the surgical stapling instrument 200 is locked,
permitting the clinician to verify if the tissue is completely captured between an anvil assembly
260 and the cartridge assembly 270.

                                                  13
[0060] Continued advancement of the first clamp slide member 226 causes the cartridge
assembly 270 to move to the clamped position in response to continued actuation of the trigger
member 214. The first frame member 224 includes a third reference character, mark, and/ or
symbol "M3" that is aligned with the indicator mark 227 when the cartridge assembly 270 is in a
clamped position (FIG. 16) to indicate that the cartridge assembly 270 is in the clamped
position. In embodiments, the third reference character "M3" is the letters "C", representing
"clamped."
[0061] With reference now to FIGS. 18-20, an end effector according to another embodiment of
the present disclosure, including an indicator feature 302, is shown generally as end effector
350. The end effector 350 is substantially similar to the end effector 150 described hereinabove,
and will only be described to the extent necessary to fully disclose the indicator feature 302.
Although shown and described as being formed on only a single side of the end effector 350, it
is envisioned that the indicator feature 302 may be included on both sides of the end effector
350.
[0062] Ajaw portion 354 of a housing 352 of the end effector 350 includes a first reference
character, mark, and/ or symbol "M1" in line with a distal edge 372a of a staple cartridge 372 of
a cartridge assembly 370 of the end effector 350. The first reference character "M1" indicates
that the cartridge assembly 270 is in the open condition (FIG. 18). The jaw portion 354 of the
housing 352 of the end effector 350 also includes a second reference character, mark, and/ or
symbol "M2" that is aligned with the distal edge 372a of a staple cartridge 372 of a cartridge
assembly 370 when the cartridge assembly 270 is in a partially clamped position to indicate that
the cartridge assembly 270 is in the partially clamped position. In addition, the jaw portion 354
of the housing 352 includes a third reference character, mark, and/ or symbol "M3" that is
aligned with the distal edge 372a of a staple cartridge 372 of a cartridge assembly 370 when the
cartridge assembly 270 is in a clamped position (FIG. 19) to indicate that the cartridge assembly
270 is in the clamped position.
[0063] Turning now to FIG. 21, a handle assembly 410 of a surgical stapling instrument 400
according to an embodiment of the present disclosure includes an indicator feature 402. The
indicator feature 402 includes an indicator member 404 in the form of a wheel member. An
outer portion of the indicator member 404 includes a plurality of teeth 404a. The plurality of
teeth 404a on the wheel member 404 is configured to engage a plurality of teeth 426a formed on

                                                   14
a first clamp slide member 426. The plurality of teeth 404a, 426a of the respective wheel
member 404 and first clamp slide member 426 may be configured such that the as the first
clamp slide member 426 is translated longitudinally, the wheel member 404 rotates
continuously. Alternatively, either or both of the plurality of teeth 404a, 426a of the respective
wheel member 404 and the first clamp slide member 426 may be configured such that the wheel
member 404 only rotates as a cartridge assembly (not shown) attains a given position, e.g.,
partially clamped, clamped.
[0064] The wheel 404 includes first, second, and third reference characters or marks "M1",
"M2", "M3" for indicating the position of a cartridge assembly (not shown) in relation to an
anvil assembly (not shown). As the first clamp slide member 226 advances distally to move the
cartridge assembly from an open position, to a partially clamped position, to the clamped
position, the wheel member 404 is rotated via contact between the plurality of teeth 426a on first
clamp slide member 426 and the plurality of teeth 404a on the wheel member 404 to align the
first, second, or third reference character "M1", "M2", "M3" with a mark (not shown) on the
stationary handle 412, or with a viewing window (not shown) of the stationary handle 412, to
indicate to a clinician the position of the cartridge assembly.
[0065] While the above description contains many specifics, these specifics should not be
construed as limitations on the scope of the present disclosure, but merely as illustrations of
various embodiments thereof. Therefore, the above description should not be construed as
limiting, but merely as exemplifications of various embodiments. Those skilled in the art will
envision other modifications within the scope and spirit of the disclosure.
