Field
[0001] The present disclosure generally pertains to track crawler systems, and is more particularly
directed to track crawler systems configured to operate with asymmetrically positioned tracks and
adjust load limitations depending on sensed track position.
Related Art
[0002] Tracked vehicles or machines may be used in a variety of construction, mining, and other
industrial applications on varied terrains including asphalt, concrete, dirt, mud, gravel, grass or
any other terrain where industrial equipment may be required. In related art tracked machines
systems, the stability of the tracked machine may be directly related to the width of tracks such
that the wider the tracks the more stable the tracked machine may be. However, larger track width
may impede access to narrow areas by some related art tracked machines. To balance these factors,
some related art tracked machines may have adjustable width tracks that can be widened to
improve stability or narrowed to improve access. Further, some related art systems may allow the
tracks to be adjusted asymmetrically such that a track can be extended on one side of the related
art tracked machine, and retracted on another, opposite side. However, during lifting operations
rotation of the body of the machine relative to the asymmetrically positioned tracks, or the
repositioning of the tracks themselves, may cause the stability of the machine to shift. As the
stability of the machine shifts, the safe load lifting parameters may change and an operator of the
machine may not be aware of how the load lifting parameters have changed. Without being aware
of the changes in how load lifting parameters have changed, the operator may inadvertently
perform an operation, such as exceeding safe lifting tolerances or rotating into an unstable position,
that can cause tipping or failure of the tracked machine.

                                    DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0014] The following detailed description provides further details of the figures and example
implementations of the present application. Reference numerals and descriptions of redundant
elements between figures are omitted for clarity. Terms used throughout the description are
provided as examples and are not intended to be limiting. For example, the use of the term
"automatic" may involve fully automatic or semi-automatic implementations involving user or
operator control over certain aspects of the implementation, depending on the desired
implementation of one of ordinary skill in the art practicing implementations of the present
application.
[0015] In some example implementations, an electronic control system that senses the placement
of the track frame assemblies of a tracked machine, as well as the position of the machine body
relative to the track frame assemblies. Based on the sensed placement of the track frame assemblies
and the position of the machine body, the electronic control system may determine load
performance parameters of the tracked machine and provide feedback to an operator based on the
determined load performance parameters. In some example implementations, the operator may
then be able to determine which operations of the tracked machine may be safely performed and
which operations may not be safely performed based on the provided feedback from the electronic
control system.
[0016] FIG. 1 is a side elevation view of an embodiment of a tracked machine 100 including an
undercarriage track system 105. FIG. 2 is a front elevation view of an embodiment of the tracked
machine 100 including the undercarriage track system 105 according to example implementations
of the present application. The term "machine" may refer to any machine that that performs some
type of operation associated with an industry such as mining or construction, or any other industry
known in the art, such as a hydraulic mining shovel, lifting crane, an excavator, a track-type tractor
(bulldozer), a cable shovel, a dragline, or the like, but is not limited thereto. In the embodiment
illustrated, the tracked machine 100 is a track-type boom crane.
[0017]           The tracked machine 100 may include a machine body 110, one or more hydraulic
systems 115, one or more engaging implements 120, and an undercarriage structure 125. The
                                                 -4-

machine body 110 may optionally include a cab 130 to house a machine operator. An electronic
control system 135 can be housed in the cab 130 that can be adapted to allow a machine operator
to manipulate and articulate the engaging implements 120 for any suitable application and
provide performance readouts to the operator. As discussed below, the electronic control system
135 may include a computing device such as computing device 705 of FIG. 7 discussed below.
[0018]          Though a cab 130 to house an operator is illustrated on the machine body 110,
example implementations of the present application are not required to have a cab or be directly
operated by an operator on the tracked machine 100. For example, some example
implementations of the present application may be remotely operated by an operator not directly
riding the tracked machine 100. The remote operator may be in the same general area as the
tracked machine 100 or may be located a large distance away. In some embodiments, the
electric control system 135 may allow control of the tracked machine 100 via radio frequency
communication, cellular communication, wired communication, or any other type of remote
control that might be apparent to a person of ordinary skill in the art.
[0019] The hydraulic system 115 may connect at one end to the machine body 110 and may
support the engaging implement 120 at an opposing, distal end. As illustrated, the engaging
implement 120 may be a lifting boom 140 with an attaching system 142 having an attachment
implement 144 mounted on a tension line 146. The tension line 146 is around a winch system 148
mounted behind the cab 130. Example implementations are not limited to this configuration, and
the winch system 148 may be repositioned as may be apparent to a person of ordinary skill in the
art. The engaging implement 120 is not limited to a lifting boom 140 and may be any type of
engaging implement 120 that might be apparent to a person of ordinary skill in the art include a
bucket boom for lifting an operator, a backhoe implement, or any other implement that might be
apparent to a person of ordinary skill in the art.
[0020] The undercarriage structure 125 may include a support structure 150 and the undercarriage
track system 105. The support structure 150 may connect the undercarriage track system 105 to
the machine body 110 and may support the undercarriage track system 105.
[0021] The undercarriage track system 105 may include a track roller frame assembly 152 and an
associated track chain assembly 154 on each side of the undercarriage structure 125. It will be
                                                  -5 -

appreciated that only one track roller frame assembly 152 and only one track chain assembly 154
is visible in FIG. 1.
[0022] The tracked machine 100 may also include a power source 156 mounted on the machine
body 110 behind the cab 130 (in FIG. 1, adjacent the cab 130 in FIG. 2). The power source 156
may provide power to one or more of the hydraulic system 115, the engaging implement 120, the
electronic control system 135, the undercarriage track system 105, or any other system that might
be apparent to a person of ordinary skill in the art. The power source 156 may embody an engine
such as, for example, a diesel engine, a gasoline engine, a gaseous fuel-powered engine, or any
other type of combustion engine known in the art. The power source 156 may alternatively
embody a non-combustion source of power such as a fuel cell, a power storage device, or another
power source that might be apparent to a person of ordinary skill in in the art. The power source
156 may produce a mechanical or electrical power output that may then be converted to
hydraulic pneumatic power for moving the engaging implement 120.
[0023] Each track roller frame assembly 152 may include one or more idler wheels 158, a drive
sprocket wheel 160, and track roller assemblies 162. In the embodiment illustrated, an idler
wheel 158 is coupled to the support structure 150 at one end, and the drive sprocket wheel 160 is
coupled to the support structure 150 at an opposite end. In other embodiments, a pair of idler
wheels 158 may be coupled to the support structure 150 and the drive sprocket wheel 160 may
be adjacent to one of the idler wheels 158.
[0024] The drive sprocket wheel 160 may be powered in forward and reverse directions by the
power source 156 of the tracked machine 100. In some embodiments, the drive sprocket wheel
160 may be coupled to the engine of the tracked machine 100 by a final drive. The drive sprocket
wheel 160 drives the track chain assembly 154 to move the tracked machine 100.
[0025] Track roller assemblies 162 may be positioned between the ends of the support structure
150 and at least partially below the support structure 150. In the embodiment illustrated, the
track roller assemblies 162 are positioned between the idler wheel 158 and the drive sprocket
wheel 160. In other embodiments, the track roller assemblies 162 are positioned between a pair
of idler wheels 158. The track roller assemblies 162 may include a front roller assembly 164 may
be positioned adjacent the idler wheel 158 at the front end of the support structure 150 and a rear
roller assembly 166 may be positioned adjacent the drive sprocket wheel 160 at the rear end of
                                                 -6-

the support structure 150. Idler wheels 158 and track roller assemblies 162/164/166 may be
configured to guide the track chain assembly 154 around the support structure 150.
[0026] In embodiments, each track chain assembly 154 may include track links (not numbered)
inter-connected and linked together to form a closed chain. In the embodiment illustrated, track
links are connected to, such as by fastening, ground engaging shoes 168. The ground engaging
shoes 168 or ground engaging portions may be configured to overlap. In other embodiments,
each track chain assembly 154 includes track pads inter-connected and linked together. The track
pads may include a track link and a ground engaging shoe that are cast or forged as an integral
unit.
[0027] As illustrated, the machine body 110 may be connected to the support structure 150 by a
rotating mechanism 170. Further, the support structure 150 may connect two track roller frame
assemblies 152 of the undercarriage track system 105 to form a support base for the machine body
110 as illustrated in FIG. 2. In some example implementations, the rotating mechanism 170 may
be a hydraulic rotary actuator that allows the machine body 110 to rotate relative to the
undercarriage track system 105. However, the rotating mechanism 170 is not limited to this
configuration and may be any mechanism that allows relative rotation between the support
structure 150 and the machine body 110.
[0028] In some example implementations, the rotating mechanism 170 may be connected to an
angular position sensor 172 that senses a relative position between the machine body 110 and the
support structure 150. The information from the Angular position sensor 172 may be used to set
and adjust performance parameters of the engaging implement 120 and provide feedback to the
electronic control system 135.
[0029] The undercarriage structure 125 may include one or more actuators 174 that connect the
support structure 150 to track roller frame assemblies 152 to allow lateral movement of the track
roller frame assemblies        152 relative to the support structure       150. In some example
implementations, the one or more actuators may be linear hydraulic actuators 174 configured to
move each track roller frame assembly 152 laterally relative to the support structure 150 as
illustrated in FIGS. 3A-5B discussed below. However, example implementations are not limited
to this configuration and any type of actuator 174 that may be apparent to a person of ordinary
skill in the art may be used to laterally move the track roller frame assemblies 152. Further in some
                                                  -7-

example implementations, the actuator 174 on each side may be configured to extend
independently of the actuator 174 on the other side. For example, an actuator 174 on a left side
may be configured to be extended completely, while an actuator 174 is only partial extended or
not extended at all.
[0030] Further, in some example implementations, each actuator 174 may be connected to a lateral
position sensor 176 configured to detect the an amount of extension associated with each actuator
174 to detect lateral positioning of each track roller frame assembly 152 relative to the support
structure 150. Based on the information obtained from each lateral position sensor 176 associated
with an actuator 174, the electronic control system 135 may provide feedback and adjust
performance parameters of the engaging implement 120. For example, different load limits may
be imposed based on the lateral extension of the track roller frame assemblies 152 and the actuators
174 connected thereto. Additionally, information from each lateral position sensor 176 associated
with an actuator 174 may be combined with information from Angular position sensor 172
associated with the rotating mechanism 170 by the electronic control system 135 to further adjust
performance parameters of the engaging implement 120. For example, different load limits may
be imposed based on both the lateral extension of the track roller frame assemblies 152 and the
rotation position of the machine body 110 relative to the support structure 150. FIGS. 3A-5B
discussed below illustrate example implementations of the performance parameter adjustments
based on the lateral extension and rotational position information received from the sensors
172/176.
[0031] FIGS 3A and 3B are schematic representations of operational areas associated with
different load performance parameter information associated with a track roller frame assembly
152 on one side being fully retracted and a track roller frame assembly 152 being fully extended
on an opposite side. The configuration of track roller frame assemblies 152 illustrated in FIGS. 3A
and 3B may be referred to a MAX/MIN configuration. In FIGS 3A and 3B, the support structure
150 is fully illustrated, but the illustration of the machine body 110 has been removed to allow
visualization of the top of the support structure 150. A reference bar 112 has been added to
illustrate the rotational positioning of the machine body 110 of the support structure 150 in
different configurations.
                                                  -8-

[0032] In the configuration illustrated in FIGS. 3A and 3B, one of the actuators 174 (illustrated on
the right) has been fully extended, and the other actuator 174 (illustrated on the left) has been fully
retracted. Further in FIG. 3A, the reference bar 112 illustrates that the machine body 110 is
positioned generally parallel to the track roller frame assemblies 152. The position of the reference
bar 112 is not intended to illustrate that the machine body 110 is exactly parallel to the track roller
frame assemblies 152, but is intended to illustrate that the machine body 110 is positioned in a
general angular range such that the machine body 110 is positioned over the front or rear of the
tracked machine 100. The configuration of the placement of the machine body 110 in FIG. 3A
may be referred to as an Over Front/Over Rear configuration.
[0033] In FIG. 3B, the reference bar 112 illustrates that the machine body 110 is positioned
substantially perpendicular to the track roller frame assemblies 152. The position of the reference
bar 112 is not intended to illustrate that the machine body 110 is exactly perpendicular to the track
roller frame assemblies 152, but is intended to illustrate that the machine body 110 is positioned
in a general angular range such that the machine body 110 is positioned over the track roller frame
assemblies 152 of the tracked machine 100. The configuration of the placement of the machine
body 110 in FIG. 3B may be referred to as an Over Max/Over Min configuration.
[0034] As discussed above, lateral position sensors 176 associated with the actuators 174 may
detect the lateral positions of the track roller frame assemblies 152. Further, an angular position
sensor 172 may detect the angular position of the rotating mechanism 170 to determine the angular
position of the machine body 110 (represented by the reference bar 112 in FIGS. 3A & 3B). Based
on the measurements of the angular position sensor 172 and the lateral position sensors 176, the
electronic control system 135 may set load performance parameters to provide feedback and, in
some example implementations optionally limit, operation of the engaging implement 120 of the
tracked equipment.
[0035] The setting and use of the load performance parameters may be done using an automated
process, such as process 600 illustrated in FIG. 6 below that is formed by a computing device, such
as computing device 705 in the computing environment 700 of FIG. 7 below. For example, a
computing device may automatically select and display on a display device for an operator a load
chart relating maximum weight ratings for the lifting boom 140 (illustrated in FIG. 1) to the length
                                                  -9-

of the lifting boom 140 and the radius from the support structure 150. An example load chart is
illustrated below as Table 1.

[0036] Alternatively, readouts (e.g., warnings) may be displayed of the weight currently being
supported by the lifting boom 140 (illustrated in FIG. 1) and whether selected maximum weight
limitations are being approached or exceeded or other unsafe operations are initiated. Additionally
or alternatively, warning alarms may be sounded or flashing warning indicators may be provided
as weight limitations are approached or exceed, or other unsafe operations are initiated.
Additionally, in some example implementations, as the machine body 110 (reference bar 112) may
be rotated relative to the support structure 150, the load performance parameters may be updated
if the machine body 110 moves into another configuration (such as between the configurations
illustrated in FIGS. 3A and 3B). The updated load performance parameters may cause the
electronic control system 135 to output a warning that tolerances have been exceeded. Further, in
some example implementations, the load performance parameters may also be updated if one or
both of the actuators 174 is activated to extend or retract the track roller frame assemblies 152
laterally into a new configuration (such as the configurations illustrated in FIGS. 4A-5B discussed
below). Again, the updated load performance parameters may cause the electronic control system
135 to output a warning that tolerances have been exceeded.
[0037] Additionally, in some example implementations, the electronic control system 135 may
automatically perform an operation based on the original or updated performance parameters. For
example, the electronic control system 135 may execute an automated rotation of the machine
body, or extension of one or both actuators 174, to a safe or stable position based on the original
or updated performance parameters. Further, in some example implementations, the electronic
control system 135 may prevent the operator from performing an operation that would exceed the
original or updated load performance parameters. For example, the electronic control system 135
may not allow the operator to rotate the machine body 110 (represented by reference bar 112) into
a different configuration or may not allow one or both of the actuators 174 to be activated to extend
or retract the track roller frame assemblies 152 laterally, if the updated load performance
parameters associated with the configuration would be exceeded. An operator may be provided
with an option to override the automated responses of the electronic control system 135 to maintain
control of the tracked machine.
                                                - 11 -

[0038] FIGS 4A and 4B are schematic representations of operational areas associated with
different load performance parameter information associated with a track roller frame assembly
152 on one side being partially extended and a track roller frame assembly 152 being fully
extended on an opposite side. The configuration of track roller frame assemblies 152 illustrated in
FIGS. 4A and 4B may be referred to a MAX/MID configuration. In FIGS 4A and 4B, the support
structure 150 is fully illustrated, but the machine body 110 has been removed to allow visualization
of the top of the support structure 150. A reference bar 112 has been added to illustrate the
rotational positioning of the machine body 110 of the support structure 150 in different
configurations.
[0039] In the configuration illustrated in FIGS. 4A and 4B, one of the actuators 174 (illustrated on
the left) has been fully extended, and the other actuator 174 (illustrated on the right) has been
partially extended. Specifically, the other actuator 174 (right side) has been illustrated extended
50% of total extension. However, other partial extension configurations may be apparent to a
person of ordinary skill in the art (e.g., 25% extension, 33% extension, 66% extension,          7 5%
extension, etc.)
[0040] Further in FIG. 4A, the reference bar 112 illustrates that the machine body 110 is positioned
generally parallel to the track roller frame assemblies 152. The position of the reference bar 112 is
not intended to illustrate that the machine body 110 is exactly parallel to the track roller frame
assemblies 152, but is intended to illustrate that the machine body 110 is positioned in a general
angular range such that the machine body 110 is positioned over the front or rear of the tracked
machine 100. The configuration of the placement of the machine body 110 in FIG. 4A may be
referred to as an Over Front/Over Rear configuration.
[0041] In FIG. 4B, the reference bar 112 illustrates that the machine body 110 is positioned
substantially perpendicular to the track roller frame assemblies 152. The position of the reference
bar 112 is not intended to illustrate that the machine body 110 is exactly perpendicular to the track
roller frame assemblies 152, but is intended to illustrate that the machine body 110 is positioned
in a general angular range such that the machine body 110 is positioned over the track roller frame
assemblies 152 of the tracked machine 100. The configuration of the placement of the machine
body 110 in FIG. 4B may be referred to as an Over Max/Over Mid configuration.
                                                  - 12 -

[0042] Again, lateral position sensors 176 associated with the actuators 174 may detect the lateral
positions of the track roller frame assemblies 152. Further, the angular position sensor 172 may
detect the angular position of the rotating mechanism 170 to determine the angular position of the
machine body 110 (represented by the reference bar 112 in FIGS. 4A & 4B). Based on the
measurements of the angular position sensor 172 and the lateral position sensors 176, the electronic
control system 135 may set load performance parameters to provide feedback and, in some
example implementations optionally limit, operation of the engaging implement 120 of the tracked
equipment.
[0043] The setting and use of the load performance parameters may be done using an automated
process, such as process 600 illustrated in FIG. 6 below that is formed by a computing device, such
as computing device 705 in the computing environment 700 of FIG. 7 below. For example, a
computing device may automatically select and display on a display device for an operator a load
chart relating maximum weight ratings for the lifting boom 140 (illustrated in FIG. 1) to the length
of the lifting boom 140 and the radius from the support structure 150. An example load chart is
illustrated below as Table 2.

supported by the lifting boom 140 (illustrated in FIG. 1) and whether selected maximum weight
limitations are being approached or exceeded or other unsafe operations are initiated. Additionally
or alternatively, warning alarms may be sounded or flashing warning indicators may be provided
as weight limitations are approached or exceed, or other unsafe operations are initiated.
Additionally, in some example implementations, as the machine body 110 (reference bar 112) may
be rotated relative to the support structure 150, the load performance parameters may updated if
the machine body 110 moves into another configuration (such as between the configurations
illustrated in FIGS. 4A and 4B). The updated load performance parameters may cause the
electronic control system 135 to output a warning that tolerances have been exceeded. Further, in
some example implementations, the load performance parameters may also be updated if one or
both of the actuators 174 is activated to extend or retract the track roller frame assemblies 152
laterally into a new configuration (such as the configurations illustrated in FIGS. 3A-3B discussed
above and FIGS. 5A-5B discussed below). Again, the updated load performance parameters may
cause the electronic control system 135 to output a warning that tolerances have been exceeded.
[0045] Additionally, in some example implementations, the electronic control system 135 may
automatically perform an operation based on the original or updated performance parameters. For
example, the electronic control system 135 may execute an automated rotation of the machine
body, or extension of one or both actuators 174, to a safe or stable position based on the original
or updated performance parameters. Further, in some example implementations, the electronic
control system 135 may prevent the operator from performing an operation that would exceed the
original or updated load performance parameters. For example, the electronic control system 135
may not allow the operator to rotate the machine body 110 (represented by reference bar 112) into
a different configuration or may not allow one or both of the actuators 174 to be activated to extend
or retract the track roller frame assemblies 152 laterally, if the updated load performance
parameters associated with the configuration would be exceeded. Of course an operator may be
provided with an option to override the automated responses of the electronic control system 135
to maintain control the tracked machine.

[0046] FIGS 5A and 5B are schematic representations of operational areas associated with
different load performance parameter information associated with a track roller frame assembly
152 on one side being partially extended and a track roller frame assembly 152 being fully retracted
on an opposite side. The configuration of track roller frame assemblies 152 illustrated in FIGS. 5A
and 5B may be referred to as a MIN/MID configuration. In FIGS 5A and 5B, the support structure
150 is fully illustrated, but the machine body 110 has been removed to allow visualization of the
top of the support structure 150. A reference bar 112 has been added to illustrate the rotational
positioning of the machine body 110 of the support structure 150 in different configurations.
[0047] In the configuration illustrated in FIGS. 5A and 5B, one of the actuators 174 (illustrated on
the left) has been fully retracted, and the other actuator 174 (illustrated on the right) has been
partially extended. Specifically, the other actuator 174 (right side) has been illustrated extended
50% of total extension. However, other partial extension configurations may be apparent to a
person of ordinary skill in the art (e.g., 25% extension, 33% extension, 66% extension, 75%
extension, etc.)
[0048] Further, in FIG. 5A, the reference bar 112 illustrates that the machine body 110 is
positioned generally parallel to the track roller frame assemblies 152. The position of the reference
bar 112 is not intended to illustrate that the machine body 110 is exactly parallel to the track roller
frame assemblies 152, but is intended to illustrate that the machine body 110 is positioned in a
general angular range such that the machine body 110 is positioned over the front or rear of the
tracked machine 100. The configuration of the placement of the machine body 110 in FIG. 5A
may be referred to as an Over Front/Over Rear configuration.
[0049] In FIG. 5B, the reference bar 112 illustrates that the machine body 110 is positioned
substantially perpendicular to the track roller frame assemblies 152. The position of the reference
bar 112 is not intended to illustrate that the machine body 110 is exactly perpendicular to the track
roller frame assemblies 152, but is intended to illustrate that the machine body 110 is positioned
in a general angular range such that the machine body 110 is positioned over the track roller frame
assemblies 152 of the tracked machine 100. The configuration of the placement of the machine
body 110 in FIG. 4B may be referred to as an Over Min/Over Mid configuration.
[0050] Again, lateral position sensors 176 associated with the actuators 174 may detect the lateral
positions of the track roller frame assemblies 152. Further, the angular position sensor 172 may
                                                  - 16 -

detect the angular position of the rotating mechanism 170 to determine the angular position of the
machine body 110 (represented by the reference bar 112 in FIGS. 5A & 5B). Based on the
measurements of the angular position sensor 172 and the lateral position sensors 176, the electronic
control system 135 may set load performance parameters to provide feedback and, in some
example implementations optionally limit, operation of the engaging implement 120 of the tracked
equipment.
[0051] The setting and use of the load performance parameters may be done using an automated
process, such as process 600 illustrated in FIG. 6 below that is formed by a computing device, such
as computing device 705 in the computing environment 700 of FIG. 7 below. For example, a
computing device may automatically select and display on a display device for an operator a load
chart relating maximum weight ratings for the lifting boom 140 (illustrated in FIG. 1) to the length
of the lifting boom 140 and the radius from the support structure 150. An example load chart is
illustrated below as Table 3.

[0052] Alternatively, readouts (e.g., warnings) may be displayed of the weight currently being
supported by the lifting boom 140 (illustrated in FIG. 1) and whether selected maximum weight
limitations are being approached or exceeded or other unsafe operations are initiated. Additionally
or alternatively, warning alarms may be sounded or flashing warning indicators may be provided
as weight limitations are approached or exceed, or other unsafe operations are initiated.
Additionally, in some example implementations, as the machine body 110 (reference bar 112) may
be rotated relative to the support structure 150, the load performance parameters may updated if
the machine body 110 moves into another configuration (such as between the configurations
illustrated in FIGS. 5A and 5B). The updated load performance parameters may cause the
electronic control system 135 to output a warning that tolerances have been exceeded. Further, in
some example implementations, the load performance parameters may also be updated if one or
both of the actuators 174 is activated to extend or retract the track roller frame assemblies 152
laterally into a new configuration (such as the configurations illustrated in FIGS. 3A-4B discussed
above). Again, the updated load performance parameters may cause the electronic control system
135 to output a warning that tolerances have been exceeded.
[0053] Additionally, in some example implementations, the electronic control system 135 may
automatically perform an operation based on the original or updated performance parameters. For
example, the electronic control system 135 may execute an automated rotation of the machine
body, or extension of one or both actuators 174, to a safe or stable position based on the original

original or updated load performance parameters. For example, the electronic control system 135
may not allow the operator to rotate the machine body 110 (represented by reference bar 112) into
a different configuration or may not allow one or both of the actuators 174 to be activated to extend
or retract the track roller frame assemblies 152 laterally, if the updated load performance
parameters associated with the configuration would be exceeded. Of course an operator may be
provided with an option to override the automated responses of the electronic control system 135
to maintain control the tracked machine.
[0054] FIG. 6 illustrates a flow chart for a process 600 of controlling a tracked machine. The
process 600 may be performed by an electronic control system of a tracked machine having a pair
                                                - 19 -

of track assemblies, such as the electronic control system 135 of the tracked machine 100
illustrated in FIGS. 1-5B discussed above. In some example implementations, the electronic
control system 135 may include a computing device such as computing device 705 of FIG. 7
discussed below.
[0055] At 605, the electronic control system may detect the position of one of the track assemblies
on a first side of the tracked machine. In some example implementations, the position of the track
assembly may be detected using a sensor connected to an actuator configured to move the track
assembly laterally relative to the tracked machine. However, other configurations may be used to
detect the position of the track assembly on the first side of the tracked machine as might be
apparent to a person of ordinary skill in the art.
[0056] In some example implementations, the position of the track assembly may be detected as
being in one of three fixed positions (e.g., "Fully Retracted", "Fully Extended", And "Half
Extended-Half Retracted"). In other example implementations, the position of the track assembly
may be detected as being positioned along a continuous spectrum of positions between fully
extended and fully retracted.
[0057] At 610, the electronic control system may detect the position of the other track assembly
on a second side opposite the first side of the tracked machine. Again, in some example
implementations, the position of the track assembly may be detected using a sensor connected to
an actuator configured to move the track assembly laterally relative to the tracked machine.
However, other configurations may be used to detect the position of the track assembly on the
second side of the tracked machine as might be apparent to a person of ordinary skill in the art.
[0058] In some example implementations, the position of the track assembly may be detected as
being in one of three fixed positioned (e.g., "Fully Retracted", "Fully Extended", And "Half
Extended-Half Retracted"). In other example implementations, the position of the track assembly
may be detected as being positioned along a continuous spectrum of positions between fully
extended and fully retracted.
[0059] At 615, the relative angular position between the machine body of the tracked machine and
a support structure supporting the track assemblies is detected. In some example implementations,
the relative angular position may be detected by an angular sensor connected to a rotating
mechanism that joins the machine body to the support structure. However, other configurations
                                                 - 20 -

may be used to detect the position of the machine body relative to the track assembly as might be
apparent to a person of ordinary skill in the art.
[0060] In some example implementations, the relative position of the machine body may be
detected as being in any position around a 3600 spectrum. In other example implementations, the
relative position of the machine body may be detected as being in one of a plurality of fixed
positions (e.g., "Over Front", "Over Rear", "Over Right Track", "Over Left Track").
[0061] After the positions of the track assemblies and the relative rotational position of the
machine body have been detected at steps 605-615, load performance parameters are set based on
the detected track positions and the machine body position at 620. In some example
implementations, the setting of load performance parameters may include automatically selecting
a pre-defined load performance table from a plurality of stored load performance tables based on
the detected track positions and machine body position. In other example implementations, the
setting of load performance parameters may include calculating load performance parameters
using known load tolerance equations based on the dimensions of the tracked machine, the lifting
rating of a lifting boom, and other factors that control how much weight a lifting boom can safely
lift that might be apparent to a person of ordinary skill in the art.            In some example
implementations, the calculation of load performance parameters may be performed using static
data that is capture only one time, recurrent data calculated at regular time intervals, or dynamic
data streams of being continuously received from one or more sensors.
[0062] After load performance parameters are set, an electronic control system provides feedback
to an operator of the tracked machine. In some example implementations, the feedback may
include displaying the selected load chart relating maximum weight ratings for the lifting boom
140 (illustrated in FIG. 1) to the length of the lifting boom 140 and the radius from the support
structure 150. Example load charts are illustrated as Tables 1-3 above.
[0063] In other example implementations, the feedback may include generating warning readouts
to be displayed of the weight currently being supported by the lifting boom 140 (illustrated in FIG.
1) and whether selected maximum weight limitations are being approached or exceeded. After the
feedback has been provided to the operator at 625, the process 600 may end in some example
implementations.
                                                 - 21 -

 [0064] Optionally, in other example implementations, the electronic control system may also
prevent the remote or in cab operator from performing an operation that would exceed the set load
performance parameters at 630. For example, the electronic control system 135 may not allow the
operator to rotate the machine body 110 (represented by reference bar 112) into a different
configuration or may not allow one or both of the actuators 174 to be activated to extend or retract
the track roller frame assemblies 152 laterally, if load performance parameters associated with a
new configuration would be exceeded.
 [0065] In some example implementations, at 635 the electronic control system may optionally
determine if the rotational position of the machine body has changed since the load performance
parameters were set. In some example implementations, a change in the relative angular position
of the machine body may be detected by an angular sensor connected to a rotating mechanism that
joins the machine body to the support structure. However, other configurations may be used to
determine if the rotational position of the machine body relative to the track assembly has changed
as might be apparent to a person of ordinary skill in the art.
 [0066] If the electronic control system determines that the machine body's rotational position has
changed (YES at 635), the process 600 may return to 615 and the steps 615-625 may be repeated
to determine updated load performance patterns and provide updated feedback to an operator. For
example, the updated load performance parameters may cause the electronic control system to
output a warning that tolerances have been exceeded. Additionally, in some example
implementations, the electronic control system may also optionally prevent the operator from
performing an operation that would exceed the updated load performance parameters at 630. For
example, the electronic control system 135 may not allow the operator to rotate the machine body
 110 (represented by reference bar 112) into a different configuration or may not allow one or both
of the actuators 174 to be activated to extend or retract the track roller frame assemblies 152
laterally, if load performance parameters associated with a new configuration would be exceeded.
 [0067] However, if the electronic control system determines that the machine body's rotational
position has not changed (NO at 635), the process 600 may continue to 640. In some example
implementations, at 640 the electronic control system may optionally determine if the lateral
positions of either of the track assemblies has changed since the load performance parameters were
set. In some example implementations, a change in the lateral position of either of the track
                                                 -22 -

assemblies may be detected by a sensor connected to the actuator connecting the track assembly
to the support structure. However, other configurations may be used to determine if the lateral
position of either track assembly has changed as might be apparent to a person of ordinary skill in

[0068] If the electronic control system determines that the lateral position of either track assembly
has changed (YES at 640), the process 600 may return to 605 and the steps 605-625 may optionally
be repeated to determine updated load performance patterns and provide updated feedback to an
operator. For example, the updated load performance parameters may cause the electronic control
system to output a warning that tolerances have been exceeded. Additionally, in some example
implementations, the electronic control system may also optionally prevent the operator from
performing an operation that would exceed the updated load performance parameters at 630. For
example, the electronic control system 135 may not allow the operator to rotate the machine body
110 (represented by reference bar 112) into a different configuration or may not allow one or both
of the actuators 174 to be activated to extend or retract the track roller frame assemblies 152
laterally, if load performance parameters associated with a new configuration would be exceeded.
[0069] However, if the electronic control system determines that the machine body's rotational
position has not changed (NO at 640), the process 600 may end.
[0070]           FIG. 7 illustrates an example computing environment 700 for an electronic
control system for a tracked machine, such as the electronic control system 135 of the tracked
machine 100 of FIG. 1. In some example implementations, the electronic control system may be
a local control system allowing control by an operator located on the tracked machine. In other
example implementations, the electric control system may be a remote control system allowing
control by a remote operator not directly located on the tracked machine. In some example
implementations, the remote operator may be in the same general area as the tracked machine.
In other example implementations, the remote operator may be located a large distance away
from the tracked machine. The electronic control system may allow control of the tracked
machine via radio frequency communication, cellular communication, wired communication, or
any other type of remote control that might be apparent to a person of ordinary skill in the art.
[0071]           The computing device 705 in the computing environment 700 can include one or
more processing units, cores, or processors 710, memory 715 (e.g., RAM, ROM, and/or the like),
                                                - 23 -

internal storage 720 (e.g., magnetic, optical, solid state storage, and/or organic), and/or I/O
interface 725, any of which can be coupled on a communication mechanism or bus 730 for
communicating information or embedded in the computing device 705.
[0072] Computing device 705 can be communicatively coupled to input/user interface 735 and
output device/interface      740. Either one or both of input/user interface 735 and output
device/interface 740 can be a wired or wireless interface and can be detachable. Input/user
interface 735 may include any device, component, sensor, or interface, physical or virtual, which
can be used to provide input (e.g., buttons, touch-screen interface, keyboard, a pointing/cursor
control, microphone, camera, braille, motion sensor, optical reader, and/or the like). Output
device/interface 740 may include a display, television, monitor, printer, speaker, braille, or the
like. In some example implementations, input/user interface 735 and output device/interface 740
can be embedded with or physically coupled to the computing device 705. In other example
implementations, other computing devices may function as or provide the functions of input/user
interface 735 and output device/interface 740 for a computing device 705.
[0073] Examples of computing device 705 may include, but are not limited to, highly mobile
devices (e.g., smartphones, devices in vehicles and other machines, devices carried by humans and
animals, and the like), mobile devices (e.g., tablets, notebooks, laptops, personal computers,
portable televisions, radios, and the like), and devices not designed for mobility (e.g., desktop
computers, server devices, other computers, information kiosks, televisions with one or more
processors embedded therein and/or coupled thereto, radios, and the like).
[0074] Computing device 705 can be communicatively coupled (e.g., via 11O interface 725) to
external storage 745 and network 750 for communicating with any number of networked
components, devices, and systems, including one or more computing devices of the same or
different configuration. Computing device 705 or any connected computing device can be
functioning as, providing services of, or referred to as a server, client, thin server, general machine,
special-purpose machine, or another label.
[0075] I/O interface 725 can include, but is not limited to, wired and/or wireless interfaces using
any communication or I/O protocols or standards (e.g., Ethernet, 802.1 1x, Universal System Bus,
WiMAX, modem, a cellular network protocol, and the like) for communicating information to
and/or from at least all the connected components, devices, and network in computing environment
                                                 - 24 -

700. Network 750 can be any network or combination of networks (e.g., the Internet, local area
network, wide area network, a telephonic network, a cellular network, satellite network, and the
like).
[0076] Computing device 705 can use and/or communicate using computer-usable or computer
readable media, including transitory media and non-transitory media. Transitory media include
transmission media (e.g., metal cables, fiber optics), signals, carrier waves, and the like. Non
transitory media include magnetic media (e.g., disks and tapes), optical media (e.g., CD ROM,
digital video disks, Blu-ray disks), solid state media (e.g., RAM, ROM, flash memory, solid-state
storage), and other non-volatile storage or memory.
[0077] Computing device 705 can be used to implement techniques, methods, applications,
processes, or computer-executable instructions in some example computing environments.
Computer-executable instructions can be retrieved from transitory media, and stored on and
retrieved from non-transitory media. The executable instructions can originate from one or more
of any programming, scripting, and machine languages (e.g., C, C++, C#, Java, Visual Basic,
Python, Perl, JavaScript, and others).
[0078] Processor(s) 710 can execute under any operating system (OS) (not shown), in a native or
virtual environment. One or more applications can be deployed that include logic unit 755,
application programming interface (API) unit 760, input unit 765, output unit 770, track position
sensing unit 775, machine body position sensing unit 780, load performance determining unit 785,
feedback providing unit 790, and inter-unit communication mechanism 795 for the different units
to communicate with each other, with the OS, and with other applications (not shown). For
example, track position sensing unit 775, machine body position sensing unit 780, load
performance determining unit 785, feedback providing unit 790, may implement one or more
processes shown in FIG. 6. The described units and elements can be varied in design, function,
configuration, or implementation and are not limited to the descriptions provided.
[0079] In some example implementations, when information or an execution instruction is
received by API unit 760, it may be communicated to one or more other units (e.g., logic unit 755,
input unit 765, output unit 770, track position sensing unit 775, machine body position sensing
unit 780, load performance determining unit 785, feedback providing unit 790). For example, the
track position sensing unit 775 may receive information from track position sensors via input unit
                                                 - 25 -

765. Similarly, the machine body position sensing unit 780 may also receive information from
angular position sensors via input unit 765. Further, both the track position sensing unit 775 and
the machine body position sensing unit 780 may provide information to the load performance
determining unit 785 to determine the load performance parameters. Based on the determined the
load performance parameters, the feedback providing unit 790 may provide feedback to an
operator of the tracked machine via the output unit 770.
[0080] In some instances, the logic unit 755 may be configured to control the information flow
among the units and direct the services provided by API unit 760, input unit 765, output unit 770,
track position sensing unit 775, machine body position sensing unit 780, load performance
determining unit 785, and feedback providing unit 790 in some example implementations
described above. For example, the flow of one or more processes or implementations may be
controlled by logic unit 755 alone or in conjunction with API unit 760.
[0081] The foregoing detailed description has set forth various example implementations of the
devices and/or processes via the use of block diagrams, schematics, and examples. Insofar as such
block diagrams, schematics, and examples contain one or more functions and/or operations, each
function and/or operation within such block diagrams, flowcharts, or examples can be
implemented, individually and/or collectively, by a wide range of hardware.

implementations have been presented by way of example only, and are not intended to limit the
scope of the protection. Indeed, the novel apparatuses described herein may be embodied in a
