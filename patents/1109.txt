FIELD OF THE INVENTION
[0002] The present invention relates generally to maintenance of a narrow body lumen. More
particularly, the present invention relates to systems or methods for diagnostic imaging or
therapeutic treatment to effectively maintain the narrow body lumen.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
[0003] For a variety of reasons, occlusions often develop in narrow body lumens (i.e., the
channel of a tubular-shaped anatomical structure, such as the fallopian tubes, intestines, and
coronary arteries) and have medically-relevant consequences on the body. Conventional
techniques employed to maintain the health of fallopian tubes, as an example of a narrow body
lumen, are described below.
[0004] Fallopian tubes are vessel-like, non-fluid filled structures that extend from the uterus to
the ovaries. On average, fallopian tubes measure between eight and ten centimeters in length.
The inner diameter of the tube varies significantly depending on the segment of the tube, with a
minimum inner diameter of approximately one millimeter and a maximum of six millimeters.
[0005] Along the length of the lumen of the fallopian tube millions of microscopic hair-like cilia
pulsate in wave-like motions at the rate of hundreds of times per second. This motion assists the
egg, delivered from the ovaries during ovulation, in passing through the tube to the uterine
cavity. Cells located in the tube's inner lining (endothelium) supply the egg with vital
nourishment and provide lubrication along the path. It is within the fallopian tube that the sperm

                                                     2
first contacts the egg. If the egg is not fertilized within twenty-four to thirty-six hours of
reaching the fallopian tube, the egg deteriorates and is removed from the tube by the body's
immune system.
[0006] Disease of fallopian tube often presents as occlusion or thickening of the fallopian tube
wall and can be caused by infection as well as scarring. In particular, pelvic inflammatory
disease (PID), urinary tract infections (UTI) as well as sexually transmitted infections (STI) may
cause severe inflammation that in turn blocks the tube. Endometriosis may also cause occlusion
when the uterine lining grows into the fallopian tube. An appendectomy or other abdominal
surgery may further similarly lead to occluded fallopian tubes. Regardless of the manner in
which it is formed, an occlusion can lead to a hydrosalpinx, where the tube increases in diameter
because it is filled with fluid. The presence of fluid prevents both the egg and sperm from
traveling through the fallopian tube, preventing fertilization. It is believed that hydrosalpinx can
reduce the success rate of in-vitro fertilization by up to 8%.
[0007] In the US alone, there are at least seven million cases of infertility annually and an
estimated 25-40% of these cases are caused by fallopian tube occlusion or disease.
Hysterosalpingogram (HSG), a procedure most commonly utilized to diagnose fallopian tube
disease, requires a radiologist to inject dye into the uterus under x-ray guidance. The dye enters
the fallopian tube through the ostia (openings) located in the uterus. If a woman's fallopian tubes
are patent (open), dye will flow into the peritoneal cavity. In order to visualize the fluid path, a
series of timed x-rays are taken.
[0008] Unfortunately, this procedure suffers from several drawbacks. By way of example, HSG
suffers from a high false negative rate of 30% and a high false positive rate of 40% due to tubal
spasms or shadow (noise) in the x-rays. This often necessitates further procedures. This high
rate of inaccuracy is also partly due to the fact that radiologists are not as intimate with the
tortuosity and topography of the fallopian tube as gynecologist or reproductive endocrinologist.
[0009] As another example of a drawback, HSG is not conducted in-office by a gynecologist or
reproductive endocrinologist, the primary caretaker of the patient, as it necessitates a substantial
investment in x-ray capital equipment mostly found in hospitals. The patient typically first
visits a gynecologist, who conducts a series of blood tests and determines whether HSG is
necessary. If it is deemed necessary, then the patient schedules an appointment with the

                                                   3
radiologist to have the HSG procedure administered. At the conclusion of the first procedure,
the patient returns either to the gynecologist or reproductive endocrinologist to discuss the
results. Because of the high inaccuracy rate associated with the HSG, the patient often returns to
the radiologist for a second procedure, creating additional unnecessary costs for both the patient
and hospital.
[0010] As yet another example, patients often complain of pain and some are allergic to the dye
used during the procedure. Furthermore, HSG must be conducted before day 12 of a woman's
menstrual cycle because the dye may harm a potential full term pregnancy, which limits options
for both doctor and patient and further extends the waiting period for a full infertility diagnosis,
which is emotionally taxing to the patient and family.
[0011] To overcome these drawbacks, different direct visualization techniques have been
attempted. Figure 1 shows an endoscope, which uses conventional optical fiber imaging
technology, as an exemplar attempt to achieve direct visualization of the fallopian tubes. In this
figure, a female reproductive anatomy 10 undergoing imaging includes fallopian tubes 12,
ovaries 14, uterus 16, uterine cavity 22, cervix 28 and fimbria 30. An imaging catheter shaft 20
is introduced into a fallopian tube, which has a consistency of a wet paper towel. Catheter shaft
20 passes through fallopian tube ostia in the uterus 18, beyond which point the fallopian tube 12
is narrow and tortuous.
[0012] Unfortunately, the wet-paper-towel consistency does not provide adequate tactile
feedback to a physician, who navigates catheter 20 through fallopian tube 12. As a result, during
the imaging procedure, the physician is not aware of the undue pressure exerted against the
fallopian tube, leading to perforation 24. To this end, Figure 1 shows a portion of catheter 26
protruding out of perforation 24 in fallopian tubes 12. Perforation of the fallopian tube may
prevent eggs from the ovaries 14 of the patient from reaching the uterus 16 for fertilization,
making perforation an unacceptable clinical adverse event in a patient who is actively
attempting to conceive. In addition to running the risk of perforating the fallopian tubes, the
imaging procedure described above involves several steps and is therefore viewed by physicians
as convoluted and difficult to perform correctly. Furthermore, the wet paper towel consistency
of the fallopian tubes prevents the attempted imaging procedure from obtaining a clear, focused
image. Specifically, during imaging, the wet paper towel consistency causes the fallopian tubes'

                                                     4
walls to "fold" over the endoscope's tip, making it difficult to maintain a sufficient distance
between the endoscope's tip and the walls of the fallopian tubes to focus and take a clear picture.
[0013] Therefore, what is needed is a novel diagnostic and therapeutic system and method
which allows for effective maintenance of a narrow body lumen, without suffering from the
drawbacks encountered by the current and attempted systems and methods described above.
[0014] It is an object of the present invention to substantially overcome or at least ameliorate
one or more of the above disadvantages, or at least provide a useful alternative.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
[0048] In the following description, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a
thorough understanding of the present invention. It will be apparent, however, to one skilled in
the art that the present invention may be practiced without limitation to some or all of these
specific details. In other instances, well-known process steps have not been described in detail in
order to not unnecessarily obscure the invention.
[0049] In certain embodiments, the present invention provides novel systems and methods for
accurate real time-visualization, which dynamically diagnose malfunction of the fallopian tubes.
[0050] In preferred embodiments of the present invention, a single-use, disposable product and
its associated procedure overcomes the many drawbacks encountered with current and attempted
diagnostic approaches. The present inventions' more accurate, dynamic procedure may be

                                                    9
conducted in an office of a gynecologist or a reproductive endocrinologist, who is typically the
first and main point of contact for an infertility patient, understands the anatomy in question, and
is better trained to dynamically change or repeat steps in the procedure if further clarification is
needed. As a result, the number of office visits and costs to both the patient and hospital are
significantly reduced, and at the same time, convenience to the parties involved is significantly
increased. Furthermore, the high false positive rate of 20% to 40% encountered by the
conventional diagnostic systems and procedures is also reduced by the present inventions' ability
to directly visualize the fallopian tubes.
[0051] Preferred embodiments of the present invention recognize that to carry out certain initial
steps of the inventive procedures, conventional diagnostic procedures may be relied upon to an
extent. By way of example, certain inventive procedures require visualization of the openings
(ostia) of the fallopian tubes in the uterus so that the tubes may be acceed. Those skilled in the
art will recognize that although conventional hysteroscopes were primarily used to evaluate and
maintain the health of a uterus, due to recent advancements in less invasive sterilization
procedures such as Essure and Adiana (during which the tube is purposely occluded), a large
numbers (e.g., up to 7,500 for the Essure alone) of gynecologists and reproductive
endocrinologists have adopted the hysteroscopes to visualize, and trans-vaginally access, the
fallopian tube. The present invention proposes to use the hysteroscope's working channel, in
certain embodiment of the present invention. Once gynecologists or reproductive
endocrinologists own or lease a hysteroscope (and the associated capital equipment), they are
free to use the inventive procedures of the present invention using the working channel of the
hysteroscope because they are unlimited in terms of which procedures they may conduct using
their hysteroscope. It is noteworthy that the working channel of any catheter, which can
visualize and gain access to the ostia of the fallopian tubes within the uterus, may be utilized by
the present invention.
[0052] In preferred embodiments of the present invention, navigating a substantially transparent
capsule, which houses a camera portion through the tortuous and narrow fallopian tubes by
using a hydraulic propulsion method, has several advantages over navigating a purely catheter
based product through the fallopian tubes. By way of example, hydraulic propulsion overcomes
the clinical adverse event of perforation, a drawback of previous direct visualization
technologies. In other preferred embodiments of the present invention, hydraulic propulsion
avoids perforation as the device does not depend on the tactile feedback of the fallopian tube.

                                                  10
Instead, the hydraulic propellant carries the camera portion through the natural path of the
fallopian tube.
[0053] In accordance with one embodiment, the present invention provides a hydraulic
propulsion device that uses a working channel of a hysteroscope to access the ostia of the
fallopian tubes. To this end, Figure 2 shows a hydraulic propulsion device 100 having a handle
portion 102, a shaft portion 104, and a seal-creating portion 106. As shown in Figure 2A, which
shows a magnified view of a tip of hydraulic propulsion device 100, device 100 includes an
imaging subassembly 108 and a capsule 110.
[0054] Referring back to Figure 2, handle portion 102 may come equipped with a hydraulic
pressure port 112, which is designed to receive a hydraulic propellant (e.g., a saline solution)
from a hydraulic propellant reservoir, such as a syringe. Hydraulic pressure port 112 is
preferably communicatively coupled to a hydraulic pressure lumen (not shown to simplify
illustration) which extends from handle portion 102 through shaft portion 104 to a location near
imaging subassembly 108.
[0055] Similarly, an electrical wire 118 runs from handle portion 102 through shaft portion 104
and is communicatively coupled to imaging subassembly 108. Electrical wire 118 enters a
handle portion at an electrical access port 114, which connects to a wire lumen. Electrical wire
118 is placed inside the wire lumen, which also extends from handle portion 102 through shaft
portion 104 to a location near image subassembly 108.
[0056] A seal-creating port 116 of Figure 2 facilitates a step of creating a seal at an ostia 18 of
the fallopian tubes 12 or inside the proximal region of the fallopian tubes. These anatomies are
shown in Figure 1. Specifically, seal-creating port 116 of Figure 2 is communicatively coupled
to a seal-creating lumen (not shown to simplify illustration), which transports the necessary
materials for creating a seal to seal-creating portion 106. In preferred embodiments, seal
creating portion 106 of the present invention is an inflatable body and the seal-creating port 116
is an inflatable port. In these embodiments, the seal-creating lumen is designed to convey air or
other gas that inflates the inflatable body and the seal-creating lumen may be referred to as the
"inflation lumen."
[0057] In addition to one or more of the ports and lumens described above, handle portion 102
preferably includes a housing 120 for holding in place coiled wire 118', and a wire retrieval

                                                   11
mechanism 122 to retrieve a hydraulically propelled wire in an operational state of device 100
(which is shown as device 200 in Figure 3). Not all features of housing 120 are shown to
simplify illustration and those skilled in the art will recognize that wire retrieval mechanism
122, in a preferred embodiment of the present invention, is akin to a fishing rod, which has a
reel mechanism for casting and retrieving a fishing line. In this embodiment, retrieval
mechanism 122 includes flexible wire 118 and a reel capable of reeling back the flexible wire
from a propelled state. During an operational state of device 100, when the reel is activated,
imaging subassembly 108 is retrieved back from a propelled state, preferably into handle portion
102.
[0058] In a more preferred embodiment of the present invention, retrieval mechanism 122
includes an electronically activated reel, which electronically activates retrieval of the reel from
the propelled state of the reel. In this embodiment, inventive devices include a pressure sensor
for conveying a pressure measurement to the electrically activating reel mechanism such that if
the pressure exceeds a predetermined value of pressure, then the electrically activating reel
mechanism ceases to retrieve imaging subassembly 108. The pressure sensor may be designed
to sense the pressure exerted on imaging subassembly 108, as it is retrieved from the narrow
body lumen.
[0059] As part of shaft portion 104, seal-creating portion 106 (e.g., inflatable body) is located
outside and distal to handle portion 102. In this configuration and when device 100 is in an
operational state, imaging portion 108 forms a perfect seal with an inner diameter of the
hydraulic propellant lumen, as shown in Figure 2A. As is explained later in connection with
Figure 3, this seal allows for hydraulic propulsion of imaging portion 108. In other preferred
embodiments of the present invention, device 100 includes a locking mechanism, which locks
imaging portion 108 within the inner diameter of the hydraulic propellant lumen until a requisite
pressure is achieved to enable hydraulic propulsion.
[0060] Image subassembly 108 preferably includes an image sensor and a light source. The
image sensor can be any object that is capable of sensing an image. In a preferred embodiment
of the present invention, the image sensor includes at least one member selected from a group
consisting of a charge coupled device (CCD), a complementary metal oxide semiconductor
(CMOS) and an optical fiber. The light source includes a fiber optics light source or a light
emitting diode ("LED").

                                                  12
[0061] In certain embodiments of the present invention, an inflatable object contains the image
sensor and the lighting source such that when the inflatable body is inflated, the imaging sensor
is positioned near or at an approximate focal length away from the narrow body lumen to allow
focused imaging of the narrow body lumen. In this embodiment, the focal length is associated
with the imaging sensor. If the image sensor is a camera, then the focal length referred to herein
is that of the camera.
[0062] As shown clearly in Figure 2A, capsule 110 protects a portion of imaging subassembly
108. In one embodiment of the present invention, capsule 110 is coated with a lubricant to
facilitate hydraulic propulsion or retrieval of the capsule through the narrow body lumen.
[0063] Capsule 110 preferably encapsulates a wireless transmitter for wirelessly transmitting
images captured by an imaging sensor of imaging subassembly 108. In certain preferred
embodiments, capsule 110 of the present invention encapsulates a pressure sensor, which senses
an amount of pressure being applied against the narrow body lumen to determine presence of
blockages within the narrow body lumen.
[0064] Capsule 110 is substantially round and therefore avoids causing tissue trauma, which is a
drawback of previously attempted direct visualization devices. Furthermore, capsule 110 has
centered within it imaging portion 108. The positioning of imaging portion 108 within capsule
110 overcomes the drawback of the fallopian tube hanging over the distal end of the catheter,
preventing an inadequate focal length and therefore unclear picture from being taken.
[0065] In one embodiment of the present invention, the capsule is designed for encapsulating an
inflatable body to enhance buoyancy of a portion of imaging subassembly 108 that is deployed
inside the narrow body lumen during hydraulic propulsion. In such embodiments, capsule 110
of the present invention facilitates hydraulic propulsion of the propelled imaging portion as the
inflatable body makes the capsule more easier carried by the hydraulic propellant.
[0066] In certain embodiments of the present invention, capsule 110 encapsulates a
microgenerator, which uses the hydraulic propellant to provide power for the light source or the
imaging sensor. In this embodiment, the microgenerator of the present invention converts
hydraulic energy into electrical energy. This electrical energy is then used to power imaging
portion 108 of the device. In other embodiments of the present invention, capsule 110
encapsulates optical fibers, which facilitate imaging by sending imaging signals from within the

                                                 13
capsule to the imaging sensor that is located outside capsule 110 and distal to handle portion
102.
[0067] Figure 2B shows a tip of device 100, according to an alternate embodiment of the
present invention, where an optical fiber 111 is used for imaging. In this embodiment, optical
fiber 111, during an operational state of device 100, conveys the image signals captured to an
image sensor located outside and proximal to shaft 104 of device 100. As standard off the shelf
optical fibers may be found having outer diameters of less than .5 mm, the diameter of capsule
110 of this embodiment may be reduced as it does not contain the sensor. As a result, the tip of
this embodiment is more easily navigated through the narrow and tortuous path of the fallopian
tubes and using optical fiber 111 represents an alternative embodiment of the present invention.
[0068] Figure 3 shows a portion of device 200 (which is the operational state of device 100),
according to one embodiment of the present invention. Device 200 includes a flexible wire 218,
a fallopian tube-access device 228, a shaft portion 204, a seal-creating portion 206, an imaging
subassembly 208 and capsule 210. Wire 218, shaft portion 204, seal-creating portion 206,
imaging subassembly 208 and capsule 210 are substantially similar to their counterparts (i.e.,
wire 118, shaft portion 104, seal-creating portion 106, imaging subassembly 108 and capsule
110) shown in Figure 1, except device 200 shows imaging subassembly 208 and capsule 210
being hydraulically propelled during an operational state of device 200. In one preferred
embodiment of the present invention, device 200 includes a sail, which surrounds imaging
subassembly 208, such that when the imaging subassembly is hydraulically propelled, the sails
expand to enhance the hydraulic propulsion of the imaging subassembly.
[0069] Although in connection with Figures 2, 2A, 2B and 3, hydraulic propulsion is described
to propel imaging subassembly 108, imaging optical fiber 111 or capsule 110, other preferred
embodiments of the present invention contemplate hydraulically propelling therapy into the
narrow body lumen. In this embodiment, imaging subassembly 108, imaging optical fiber 111 or
capsule 110 are absent and electrical access port 114 is replaced by a therapy port. Furthermore,
the therapy port is communicatively coupled to a therapy lumen, which replaces the wire lumen.
Effective therapies contemplated by the present invention are detailed below. In another
embodiment of the present invention, an electrical and therapeutic port co-exist to allow direct
visualization as the therapy is being administered.

                                                    14
[0070] To effectively maintain fallopian tubes, the present invention also offers
non-hydraulically propelled imaging or therapeutic devices. In certain embodiments of the
present invention, a guidewire and/or a catheter, which is positioned over the guidewire,
facilitate imaging or therapy. In other embodiments, the guidewire lumen of the present
invention facilitates therapeutic intervention.
[0071] Figure 4A shows two different ovular-shaped protective shields, according to certain
embodiments of the present invention, shown as part of a single distal tip 326, which may be
designed to function either as a guidewire-based diagnostic imaging device or as a guidewire
lumen-based therapeutic intervention device. Figure 4B shows a top view of distal tip 326',
which is the same as distal tip 326, except in a different orientation. Two different protective
shields, i.e., a first protective shield 330 and a second protective shield 330', are shown in Figure
4A as being part of single distal tip 326, those skilled in the art will recognize that only one
protective shield is necessary in this embodiment of the present invention.
[0072] As shown in Figure 4A, distal tip 326 of inventive catheters includes a shaft portion 304,
one or more light sources 332, an imaging portion 308 and a guidewire 334. Guidewire 334
guide inventive catheters during an imaging procedure inside the fallopian tubes, for example.
According to the present invention, however, guidewire 334 is preferably designed to provide
light or is capable of sensing an image. To this end, guidewire 334 may contain illuminating
fibers or imaging fibers. If an inventive catheter contains illuminating fibers, then the associated
guide wire, which guides that catheter during operation, may include imaging fibers.
Alternately, if the inventive catheter contains imaging fibers, then the associated guidewire 334
may include illuminating fibers. According to the present invention, in this manner, structures
for carrying out illuminating and imaging functions may be distributed between a catheter and
its associated guidewire. Separating a light source from an imaging sensor allows a device user
to control the amount and angle of light needed to capture a clearer image (akin to a professional
photographer having an external flash).
[0073] In certain embodiments of the present invention, guidewire 334 includes optical fibers
for providing light to facilitate imaging, and may be made from fiber optics.
[0074] In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, during an operation state
of device with distal tip 326, guidewire 334 extends from a location outside the fallopian tube to

                                                   15
another location inside the fallopian, such that light is conveyed from the location outside the
fallopian tube to the location inside the fallopian tube. Having the source of the lighting remain
outside of the fallopian tube will reduce heat exposure to the fallopian tubes.
[0075] In preferred embodiments of the inventive catheters, guidewire 334 includes a plurality
of substantially transparent portions along a length of the guidewire. Each of the plurality of
substantially transparent portions allow light to pass through. During an operational state of the
catheter, each of the substantially transparent portions illuminate a plurality of different
locations along the length of the fallopian tube that are adjacent to the substantially transparent
portions. In this embodiment, a light emitting diode ("LED") may be located at or around a
guidewire's tip and, as a result, incident light emanating from the LED exits from the
substantially transparent portions and illuminates the tissue.
[0076] Inventive catheters may further include an image sensor located at a proximal end of a
catheter shaft (e.g., 104 of Figure 2) or inside a handle portion (e.g., 102 of Figure 2) of the
catheter. In this configuration of the inventive catheters, the above-mentioned imaging fibers
extend along a length of the catheter shaft such that, during an operational state of the catheter,
the imaging fibers facilitate imaging by sending imaging signals from a distal end of the catheter
to the imaging sensor. Keeping the sensor outside of the catheter's shaft reduces an outer
diameter of the catheter, and therefore, allows the physician to more easily navigate the
fallopian tubes and reduces the potential for tissue trauma.
[0077] In alternate embodiments of the present invention, the catheters further include an image
sensor for sensing an image. In this embodiment, the image sensor is located at a distal end of a
catheter shaft such that, during an operational of the catheter, an image of the fallopian tube
sensed by the imaging sensor is conveyed by the imaging fibers or by electrical wires, which
extend along a length of the catheter shaft, to a display unit that is located outside the fallopian
tube. Although this configuration may increase the catheter's outer diameter, it provides a
clearer image as the sensor is located closer to the image being taken.
[0078] Protective shield 330 or 330' of Figure 4A, during an operational state of the device,
preferably protect an image sensor and/or imaging fibers and further provide an approximate
focal length (that is associated with the image sensor) between the image sensor and/or the
imaging fibers and the fallopian tube to obtain a substantially focused image. Protective shield

                                                    16
of the present invention overcomes the drawback of the fallopian tube hanging over the
catheter's tip, which makes it hard to capture a clear image.
[0079] In other preferred embodiments, inventive catheters include a light source (e.g., light
source 332 shown in Figure 4A) that is located at a distal end of a catheter shaft such that a
substantially transparent protective shield (e.g., protective shield 330 or 330' of Figure 4A)
protects the image sensor and/or the imaging fibers, and the light source is located outside the
protective shield as shown in Figure 4A. This embodiment prevents illumination of the fallopian
tube to be distorted by the presence of the substantially transparent protective shield.
[0080] The present invention recognizes that during an imaging operation, fallopian tube tissue
might fold over a light source and block illumination, and thereby, prevent proper illumination
of a target location. In alternate preferred embodiments, inventive catheters include a light
source that is protected by the substantially transparent protective shield. In this embodiment,
the presence of a protective shield, prevents the fallopian tube tissue from folding over and
blocking the light source.
[0081] To reduce the risk of perforating the fallopian tube during an imaging operation as
encountered by certain imaging attempts discussed above, inventive catheters preferably include
a pressure sensor. In one implementation of this embodiment, the pressure sensor is located at a
distal end of the guidewire and/or the catheter. During an imaging operation, the pressure sensor
is capable of measuring a value of pressure exerted by the guidewire and/or the catheter against
the fallopian tube. The pressure sensor may be communicatively coupled to a processor that
provides an alert signal during an imaging operation. If, during an imaging operation, the value
of pressure exerted by the guidewire and/or the catheter inside the fallopian tube is equal to or
exceeds a predetermined unacceptable value of pressure, the pressure may provide the alert
signal to a catheter's user (e.g., activating a red warning light on the handle).
[0082] Inventive catheters may further include a guidewire lumen having defined therein a
channel for the guidewire (e.g., guidewire 334 of Figure 4A). During an operational state of the
catheter, and in absence of the guidewire inside the guidewire lumen (e.g., when an imaging
operation has concluded), the channel inside the guidewire lumen is capable of transporting
therapy to the fallopian tube.

                                                    17
[0083] The therapy includes at least one member selected from a group consisting of an anti
inflammatory agent, bio-absorbable stent and a drug-coated inflatable body. In certain
embodiments of the present invention, a liquid anti-inflammatory agent is delivered locally to a
diseased site. Inflammation (likely caused by infection) is thought to be the leading cause of
fallopian tube occlusion.
[0084] In those embodiments of the present invention where therapy includes a bio-absorbable
stent, the stent provides to the fallopian tubes both mechanical support and a drug, which treats a
local disease and prevents the occlusion from recurring. After the stent is absorbed by the body
and the disease is treated, the egg, may uninterruptedly pass from the ovaries through the
fallopian tube to the uterus.
[0085] With respect to the drug-coated inflatable body, during an operational state of the
catheter, when the inflatable body (such as a balloon) is expanded, debris found within the
fallopian tube may be dislodged by the force it takes to expand the balloon. Furthermore, the
inflatable body may be positioned within a partial blockage. In this case, the expansion force
will applies sufficient mechanical force to a blockage and serves to clear the blockage.
[0086] Furthermore, the drug-coating on the inflatable body (e.g., anti-inflammatory agent)
prevents recurrence of those blockages for a time adequate to allow for conception. On the other
hand, drug coated balloons used to treat coronary artery disease, face the challenge of a
continuous blood flow which eventually rids the artery of the drug. Consequently, the patient
only temporarily sees the benefit of the therapy, where treatment of coronary artery disease
needs to last a lifespan of a patient. In contrast, the fallopian tubes are not inherently fluid filled.
Therefore, the drug will last longer in the diseased region of the fallopian tube. Furthermore, the
impact of the drug need only last for as long as it takes the patient to conceive (on average 0 to
12 months). If the drug dissipates and blockages do occur at some point after conception, those
blockages do not cause any pain or discomfort to the patient.
[0087] Figure 5A shows a conical-shaped distal tip 426, according to one embodiment of the
present invention. The conical-shaped distal tip 426 is preferably part of a guidewire-based
diagnostic imaging device or in a guidewire lumen-based therapeutic intervention device.
Regardless of the manner in which distal tip 426 is implemented, it includes a shaft portion 404,
one or more light sources 432 (labeled in Figure SB), an imaging portion 408, a protective

                                                  18
shield 430 and guidewire 434, all of which are substantially similar to their counterparts
shown in Figure 4A (i.e., shaft portion 304, one or more light sources 332, imaging portion 308,
protective shield 330 and guidewire 334, respectively), except Figure SA shows an conical
shaped distal tip provides the image sensor a different focal length than that provided by the
ovular-shaped distal tip of Figure 4A, and protective shield 430 has defined therein an ingress
aperture 436 and an egress aperture 438. During an imaging operation, guidewire 434, which is
positioned outside protective shield 430, is capable of entering through ingress aperture 436 and
exiting from egress aperture 438. In other words, apertures 436 and 438 allow guidewire 434 to
pass through protective shield 430 and access a location in the fallopian tubes that is distal to
protective shield 430. This will allow the physician to push away from the fallopian tube wall
using the guidewire if additional distance is needed in order to capture a clear image.
[0088] Furthermore, the conical shape may introduce less tissue trauma than the ovular-shaped
protective shield. Figure 5B is a top view of a distal tip 426', which is the same as distal tip 426
shown in Figure 5A, except distal tip 426' has a different orientation than distal tip 426.
[0089] Preferred embodiments of the present invention also provide non-guidewire based
diagnostic imaging device or a non-guidewire lumen-based therapeutic intervention device. A
non-guidewire based diagnostic imaging device includes a sensing lumen, a solution lumen and
optionally a therapeutic lumen. The sensing lumen, in turn, includes a sensing portion and an
inflatable portion. The sensing portion is capable of sensing information (e.g., imaging
information) about the fallopian tube.
[0090] The solution lumen is designed to provide a solution, which facilitates sensing carried
out by the sensing portion. The solution is also designed to flush the fallopian tube, ridding it of
residual blood and mucous, which obscures the image. Furthermore, presence of the solution
facilitates in the expansion of the fallopian tube and thereby reduces the chance of causing a
perforation. Finally, therapeutic solutions used in the therapeutic are discussed above in greater
detail.
[0091] During an operational state of the non-guidewire based diagnostic device, the inflatable
portion inflates to create a space around the sensing portion such that in presence of the solution,
the sensing portion senses information regarding the fallopian tube, including but not limited to
the presence of sterilization implants and naturally occurring blockages. This space allows for

                                                   19
there to be an adequate focal length between the sensing portion and the fallopian tube wall to
facilitate capturing a clear image (e.g., a clear image may be taken if the sensing portion is a
standard optical camera or light-wave scattering optical system). However, if the sensing portion
consists of a sound-wave imaging system, then the inflatable portion creates a seal so that the
fallopian tube may be filled with a liquid medium, through which sound waves can propagate.
[0092] The sensing portion may include at least one member selected from a group consisting of
light source, a camera, an acoustic imaging system and a scattered-light imaging system. Certain
current techniques used for cardiovascular imaging (e.g., intravascular ultrasound ("IVUS") and
optical coherence tomography ("OCT")) utilize light scattering and acoustic imaging techniques,
but do not lend themselves to imaging fallopian tubes because of their rigidity. Furthermore,
current cardiovascular IVUS catheters are not capable of creating a seal to facilitate imaging of a
structure which is inherently non-fluid filled because in the absence of a medium, sound waves
do not travel. It is noteworthy that because the fallopian tube is non-fluid filled, a seal must be
created and the fallopian tube must be filled with a liquid medium, such as saline, before
imaging using sound waves can occur. Further still, these catheters have relatively large
dimensions which make it difficult to access the length of the narrow and tortuous fallopian
tube.
[0093] To this end, the present invention proposes that catheter designs of IVUS and OCT may
be modified in a manner consistent with the different relevant inventive catheters. Inventive
catheters described herein are not limited to IVUS and OCT applications, and work well with
other optical imaging techniques (e.g., imaging carried out by complementary metal oxide
semiconductor ("CMOS") or optical fiber). In accordance with preferred embodiments,
inventive catheters include unique atraumatic tips and/or inflatable bodies as described below.
[0094] The imaging information collected by image portion 508 provides such information
about the fallopian tube as naturally occurring blockage, inflammation, hydrosalpinx,
sterilization implants operatively placed in the fallopian tubes and disease of the fallopian tube.
This information is particularly valuable in diagnosing fallopian tube disorder and allows for
disease- specific therapeutic intervention, if needed.
[0095] Figure 6A shows a non-guidewire based diagnostic device where the sensing portion
senses image information about the fallopian tube, allowing the physician to diagnose disease.

                                                     20
Specifically, Figure 6A is a side view of a non-inflated conical-shaped distal tip 526, according
to one embodiment of the present invention that is preferably used in a non-guidewire-based
diagnostic imaging device or in a non-guidewire lumen-based therapeutic intervention device.
Distal tip 526 includes an imaging portion 508, an inflatable portion 506 and a shaft portion 504.
Imaging portion 508 and shaft portion 504 are substantially similar to their counterparts in
Figure 5A (i.e., imaging portion 408 and shaft portion 404), except shaft portion 404 of Figure
5A contains a guidewire 434.
[0096] In accordance with one preferred embodiment, inventive distal tips include a pressure
sensor located at a distal end of a catheter and are designed to measure a value of pressure
exerted by the catheter during an operational state of the device. The pressure sensor features
described above to alert a user of undue excessive pressure may also be incorporated in this
embodiment.
[0097] Figure 6B is a side view of the conical-shaped distal tip of Figure 6A in its inflated state.
Inflatable portion 506, in its inflated state (i.e., inflated portion 506' of Figure 6B) has an
atraumatic shape, which is one shape selected from a group consisting of conical, ovular and
dome.
[0098] Figure 7A is a side view of another non-inflated ovular-shaped distal tip 626, according
to one embodiment of the present invention, also preferably used in a non-guidewire-based
diagnostic imaging device or in a non-guidewire lumen-based therapeutic intervention device.
Distal tip 626 is substantially similar to distal tip 526 of Figure 6A (i.e., imaging portion 608
and shaft portion 604 are substantially similar to imaging portion 508 and shaft portion 504 of
Figure 6A), except inflatable portion 606 of Figure 7A has a different shape than inflatable
portion 506 of Figure 6A. The differences in shape between inflatable portions 506 and 606 are
evident in their respective inflatable states and may correspond to different focal lengths and
different amounts of tissue trauma. Figure 7B is a side view of ovular-shaped distal tip 626',
which is in an inflated state of distal tip 626 of Figure 7A.
[0099] Figure 8A is a side view of a non-inflated dome-shaped distal tip 726, according to one
embodiment of the present invention, preferably used in a non-guidewire-based diagnostic
imaging device or in a non-guidewire lumen-based therapeutic intervention device. Distal tip
726 is substantially similar to distal tip 526 of Figure 6A (i.e., imaging portion 708 and shaft

                                                  21
portion 704 are substantially similar to imaging portion 508 and shaft portion 504 of Figure 6A),
except inflatable portion 706 of Figure 8A has a different shape than inflatable portion 806 of
Figure 6A. Like the differences between inflatable portions 506 and 606, the differences in
shape among inflatable portions 506, 606 and 706 are evident in their respective inflatable
states. Figure 8B is a side view of ovular-shaped distal tip 726', which is in an inflated state of
distal tip 726 of Figure 7A.
[0100] Figure 8C shows certain major components, according to one embodiment of the present
invention, in an inflated distal tip 826, which is substantially similar to inflated distal tip 726' of
Figure 8B. Figure 8C shows a more detailed structure that is preferably contained within
inflatable portion 806. According to this figure, inflatable portion 806 includes an inflatable
component 806A and a non-inflatable component 806B. During an operational state of the
device, the inflatable component 806A inflates, while non-inflatable component 806B does not
inflate, but serves to provide mechanical support to inflatable portion 806.
[0101] Figure 9 shows a process flow diagram 900, according to one embodiment of the present
invention that uses a hydraulic propulsion mechanism for diagnostic imaging. Preferably
process 900 begins in step 902, which involves establishing a channel from outside a narrow
body lumen to a proximal region of the narrow body lumen or a region that is proximate to the
narrow body lumen. By way of example, a hysteroscope is used to visualize and gain access to
the ostia of the fallopian tubes within uterus. In this case, the working channel of the
hysteroscope establishes the channel of step 902 from outside the fallopian tube to the ostia of
the fallopian tube within uterus.
[0102] Next, step 904 of Figure 9 includes placing an imaging device or a therapeutic device
through the channel. Continuing with the above example of the hysteroscope, step 904 is carried
out by introducing shaft portion 104 of device 100 of Figure 2 through the working channel of
the hysteroscope until the distal end of shaft portion 104 is slightly distal to the distal end of the
hysteroscope' s working channel or until the distal end of shaft portion 104 is located in the
approximate region of the fallopian tube.
[0103] In this configuration, step 906 of Figure 9 is carried out. Step 906 includes creating a
seal in or outside the narrow body lumen such that in presence of a hydraulic propellant the
narrow body lumen is pressurized to allow diagnostic imaging or therapeutic treatment of the

                                                  22
narrow body lumen. In order to create a seal in the fallopian tube, for example, the seal-creating
portion 106 of Figure 2 may be expanded either proximal to the fallopian tube ostia in the uterus
or within the proximal region of the fallopian tube. The seal will allow pressure to build the
portion of the device which is meant to be hydraulically propelled.
[0104] Then, another step 908 of Figure 9 includes hydraulically propelling, using the hydraulic
propellant, the imaging portion (108 of Figure 2A) or the therapeutic device contained in the
capsule (110 of Figure 2A) through the narrow body lumen. By way of example, device 200 of
Figure 3 shows a capsule 210, which is attached to handle portion 102 of Figure 2 by a wire 218
of Figure 3, being hydraulically propelled. Several steps may be taken to aid in the propulsion of
the capsule (e.g., capsule 210 of Figure 3). The capsule, which may be made from a
substantially transparent material, is preferably inflated. Alternately, the capsule may contain an
inflatable body, such as a balloon, which is preferably inflated. These steps enhance the
buoyancy of the capsule, aiding the propulsion of the capsule. Furthermore, in its propelled
state, sails 238 of Figure 3 attached to imaging subassembly 208 will deploy to capture the
hydraulic propellant (which is akin to sails on a sail boat that capture the power of wind to
propel the boat's forward movement).
[0105] After step 908 and once a diseased portion of the fallopian tube or the fimbria of the
fallopian tube is reached, step 910 of Figure 9 includes treating or imaging the narrow body
lumen. As discussed above in reference to Figures 2, 2A, 2B and 3 imaging is carried out by
imaging subassembly 108 of Figure 2A. Imaging, according to certain embodiments of
inventive step 908, is carried out in an antegrade fashion (during forward propulsion of imaging
subassembly 108) or retrograde fashion (during retrieval of imaging subassembly 108). With
respect to treating the narrow body lumen, once the disease state is imaged, one therapy selected
from a group consisting of flushing saline to rid the fallopian tube of debris, applying
anti-inflammatory agent in liquid form and applying mechanical force to an occlusion using an
inflatable body (e.g., seal-creating portion 104 of Figure 2), is preferably carried out.
[0106] Process 900 preferably comes to an end in step 912 of Figure 9, which involves
retrieving the imaging device from the narrow body lumen. By way of example, retrieval
mechanism 122 of Figure 2 is activated to retrieve the imaging device from the fallopian tube.
The retrieval mechanism is preferably activated by engaging a reel mechanism (e.g., mechanism

                                                  23
122 of Figure 2), which is placed on the handle. Alternately, the entire device may be pulled
back towards the user to remove it from the narrow body lumen.
[0107] It is noteworthy that steps 902 and 904 of Figure 9 are optional and that the steps
mentioned above need not be carried out in any particular order. Rather the sequence of steps
described above represent a more preferred embodiment of the present invention. Process 900
can be carried out using any structure and is not limited to any structure shown in Figures 2, 2A,
2B and 3. The structures shown in these figures serve as examples and are used to facilitate
discussion regarding process 900.
[0108] Figure 10 shows a process flow diagram 1000, according to one embodiment of the
present invention that uses a guidewire mechanism for diagnostic imaging. Preferably process
1000 begins in step 1002, which involves establishing a channel from outside a female anatomy
to a proximal region of a fallopian tube or a fallopian tube ostia within uterus. Step 1002 is
substantially similar to the imaging aspect of step 902 of Figure 9.
[0109] Next, step 1004 includes steering a guidewire through the channel to a target location
within a lumen of a fallopian tube and the guidewire capable of providing light or imaging. By
way of example, guidewire 334 in Figure 4A is bundle of optical fiber capable of providing light
or imaging a fallopian tube.
[0110] In this configuration, step 1006 is carried out. Step 1006 includes placing a catheter,
which facilitates imaging or therapy, over the guide wire. Depending on whether guidewire 334
of Figure 4A is capable of imaging or illuminating, the catheter contains the complementary
structure to facilitate imaging.
[0111] Then, another step 1008 includes imaging the fallopian tube using the guidewire and the
catheter. By way of example, imaging as required by this step is carried out by positioning
guidewire 334 of Figure 4A relative to the catheter (e.g., catheter 304 of Figure 4A) so that the
correct amount and angle of light illuminates the portion of fallopian tube being imaged.
Furthermore, a protective shield (e.g., shield 330 of Figure 4A) is positioned so that the
appropriate focal length is achieved between the fallopian tube wall and the imaging portion
(e.g., imaging portion 308 of Figure 4A).

                                                 24
[0112] After step 1008, step 1010 includes removing the guidewire from the channel.
Continuing with the guidewire example of Figure 4A, guidewire 344 is removed from the
hysteroscope's working channel referenced in step 1002 of Figure 10. This allows the guidewire
channel to be used for delivery of therapy.
[0113] Next step 1012 includes introducing regional therapy to the fallopian tube through the
channel. Therapy in this step is preferably introduced by way of an additional therapeutic
catheter or in liquid form through the guidewire channel discussed above.
[0114] Process 1000 preferably comes to an end in step 1014, which involves treating the
fallopian tube using the regional therapy or the catheter. Therapy in this step is preferably one
therapeutic solution selected from a group consisting of applying an anti-inflammatory agent in
liquid form, introducing a drug-coated balloon (e.g., coated with an anti-inflammatory),
introducing a bio-absorbable stent and flushing with saline to remove debris from the fallopian
tube.
[0115] It is noteworthy that steps 1002. 1010, 1012 and 1014 are optional and that the steps
mentioned above need not be carried out in any particular order. Rather the sequence of steps
described above represent a more preferred embodiment of the present invention. In one
preferred embodiment of the present invention, another step may be added. Specifically, after
imaging has concluded at the end of step 1008, another step, which includes retrieving the
catheter from the fallopian tube is more preferably carried out. Process 900 can be carried out
using any structure and is not limited to any structure shown in Figures 4A, 4B, SA and SB. The
structures shown in these figures serve as examples and are used to facilitate discussion
regarding process 1000.
[0116] Although illustrative embodiments of this invention have been shown and described,
other modifications, changes, and substitutions are intended. By way of example, the present
invention discloses fallopian tubes as an exemplar of a narrow body lumen, which may undergo
maintenance, and other anatomical structures, such as coronary arteries, may be similarly
maintained Accordingly, it is appropriate that the appended claims be construed broadly and in a
manner consistent with the scope of the disclosure, as set forth in the following claims.
