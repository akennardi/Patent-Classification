AUTO-INDEXING SYSTEM FOR A WATERPROOF CAMERA HOUSING
Field
   [0001] The present invention relates to a waterproof camera housing and in particular to an
   auto-indexing baffle for waterproof camera housings.
Background
   [0002] When capturing photographs using different lenses, photographers often use a port to
   adjust the amount of light entering the camera lens. Ports are usually detachable from the
   camera housing so that the photographer can choose whether or not to limit extraneous light
   (known) as flares that may enter the lens. Extraneous light can degrade the image, create
   undesirable effects and destroy shadow detail.
   [0003] In regards to waterproof camera housings, ports typically have a baffle with a single
   opening which aligns with the lens of the camera when the port is screwed into place and
   forms a waterproof seal with the housing.
   [0004] As camera technology has progressed from single lens to dual lens designs, there is a
   problem associated with aligning a dual opening baffle of the port with a dual lens camera or
   the like. Currently, indexing or clocking systems for camera ports require the user to begin
   screwing the port into place from a particular start position, so that the baffle of the port stops
   in alignment with the dual lens camera. This is a tedious solution to the problem and usually
   requires the user to follow a set of complicated instructions which are often ignored or
   misunderstood, potentially leading to damage of the baffle or poor quality photographs.
   [0005] It is an object of the present invention to substantially overcome or at least ameliorate
   the above disadvantage.
Summary of Invention
   [0006] An aspect of the present invention provides an auto-indexing system for aligning a
   baffle to a fixed mount comprising: a port assembly having a port and a baffle rotatable with
   respect to each other, the baffle having a stop member; the fixed mount having an opening

                                                 2
   adapted to receive the port assembly, the fixed mount having one or more stop members;
   wherein in use, when mounting the port assembly to the fixed mount, the port and baffle
   rotate together until the stop member of the baffle contacts the one or more stop features of
   the fixed mount to prevent further rotation of the baffle relative to the port.
[0007] In a preferred embodiment, the fixed mount and the port assembly have matching thread
pitches, and the fixed mount has two stop members with axial spacing greater than the thread
pitch of the fixed mount.
[0008] In a preferred embodiment, the two stop members of the fixed mount have an angular
spacing greater than a width of the stop member of the baffle.
[0009] In a preferred embodiment, the baffle aligns to a camera lens.
[0010] In a preferred embodiment, the fixed mount is part of a housing.
[0011] In a preferred embodiment, the lens port has two openings to be aligned with respective
lenses of a dual lens camera.
[0012] In a preferred embodiment, the port continues to rotate after stop member of the baffle
contacts the one or more stop members of the fixed mount, until the port forms a watertight seal
with the housing.
[0013] In a preferred embodiment, the stop member extends outwardly from the baffle.
[0014] In a preferred embodiment, the stop member of the fixed mount extends inwardly within
the opening of the housing.
[0015] In a preferred embodiment, the housing has an internal thread.
[0016] In a preferred embodiment, the port assembly has an external thread.
[0017] In a preferred embodiment, the baffle and the port are concentric with one another.

Description of Embodiments
[0029] Figures 1 to 10 show a waterproof camera housing 10 and an auto-indexing port
assembly 20 according to a preferred embodiment of the invention. Turning specifically to the
port assembly 20, best shown in Figure 5, the port assembly 20 has a port 22 and a baffle 26.
The port 22 has a knurling to aid in gripping the port assembly. The baffle 26 is seated on step
23. The port assembly 20 also has a transparent portion 24. The baffle 26 has a lens port 27
comprising openings 28 and 29, best shown in Figure 7. Figure 1 shows how the openings 28
and 29 align with the lenses of a dual lens camera 16 of a smartphone 15, located within an

                                                   4
internal volume of camera housing 10. The baffle 26 has a stop member 21 extending outwardly
from the baffle 26, best shown in Figures 7 and 8. The stop member 21 projects outwardly from
the baffle 26 and has a bump 30, best shown in Figure 8.
[0030] The camera housing 10 has side walls 2 and 3; a front surface 17 has a fixed mount in
the form of an opening 11; and a viewing surface 14, which all together defines an internal
volume. The viewing surface 14 is transparent so that in use, the screen of smartphone 15 can be
viewed. The viewing surface 14 is pivotally attached to the front surface 17 via hinge 19. A
clasp 18 is also pivotally mounted to the viewing surface 14 via hinge 1. The clasp 18 slidably
engages the front surface 17 via tracks (not shown) to bring the side walls of viewing surface 14
and the side walls of front surface 17 into waterproof alignment, in a manner known to those
skilled in the art. There is also a waterproof button 4 located on side wall 2 to operate a button
on the side of the smartphone 15.
[0031] The camera housing 10 has a fixed mount or opening 11 adapted to receive the port
assembly 20. The camera housing 10 and port assembly 20 are threadably engaged via threads
13 and 25 to provide a waterproof seal between the port assembly 20 and the camera housing 10
via seal 32. There is also a seal 31 located between the transparent portion 24 and the port 22,
best shown in Figure 9. The fixed mount or opening 11 has stop member 12 and preferably stop
member 34 which project inwardly, best shown in Figures 1 and 10. The stops 12 and 34 are
configured so that they are axially spaced greater than the thread pitch of the fixed mount or
opening 11. In other words, the variation in height between stop 12 and stop 34 is greater than
the pitch of thread 13. Also, the stop members 12 and 34 have an angular spacing greater than
the width of stop feature 21.
[0032] Use of the invention will now be described.
[0033] With reference to Figures 1, 4 and 5, the smartphone 15 is placed within the internal
volume of the camera housing 10 and sealed using clasp 18. The port assembly 20 is then
screwed via thread 25 into the opening 11 of the camera housing 10 via thread 13. When
initially threading or mounting the port assembly 20 to the fixed mount or opening 11, the baffle
26 and the port 22 rotate together, such that the port assembly 20 rotates as one assembly along
thread 13. It should be noted that the transparent portion 24 is fixed to the port 22 under the seal
31. The placement of the transparent portion 24 traps the baffle 26 under the transparent portion

                                                  5
24 and on step 23, keeping it in place, but allowing the baffle 26 to freely rotate relative to the
port 22.
[0034] The baffle 26 and the port 22 will rotate together as an assembly along thread 13 until
the port assembly 20 is threaded far enough along thread 13, such that the stop member 21 of the
baffle 26 contacts the stop member 12 of the fixed mount 11. Once the stop member 21 contacts
the stop member 12, the baffle 26 stops rotating with respect to the port 22. The port 22
continues to rotate along thread 13 of the opening 11 until a waterproof seal with the opening 11
of housing 10 is attained via seal 32.
[0035] During the further rotation of port 22 beyond the contact of stop members 21 and 12, the
bump 30 of stop feature 21 will protrude between the stop member 12 and the stop member 34
of the opening 11, thereby preventing rotation of the port 26 in either clockwise or anticlockwise
directions. In use, the stop member 21 will always contact the relatively taller stop member 12
of the opening 11 first, and prior to contact with stop member 34, thus ensuring the openings 28
and 29 of port 26 are appropriately aligned with dual lens camera, regardless of the starting
position of the port assembly.
[0036] When the stop member 21 and the stop member 12 have made contact with each other
during the above described baffle assembly installation process, the lens port 27 and its openings
28, 29 will be aligned, and will remain aligned, with the dual lens of a camera located within the
camera housing 10. This is known as the aligned position and best shown in Figure 9. The stop
members 21, 12 and 34 thereby serve to locate the baffle 26 in an aligned position with the
camera lens 16 of the smartphone 15.
[0037] In embodiments, the transparent portion 24 may be a piece of glass that is flat, or
concave or convex to provide a lens. This could be a 'fisheye' lens, for example.
[0038] Advantages of the port assembly 20 will now be described.
[0039] The port assembly 20 can be threaded into the opening 11 of the housing 10, and reach
the aligned position regardless of where the user has started to thread the port assembly 20. This
is advantageous as installation of the baffle becomes simpler, faster and less cumbersome. There
is thus also no need for complex instructions for a user to follow to align the lens port and dual

                                                   6
camera lenses. A further advantage is that a user is far less likely to damage the baffle since no
instructions are required for the baffle to reach the aligned position.
[0040] Although the invention has been described with reference to preferred embodiments, it
will be appreciated by persons skilled in the art that the invention may be embodied in many
other forms.
