                                 CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS
[0001]                     The present application is a divisional application of Australian Application No.
<removed-apn>, the original disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.
                                                 TECHNICAL FIELD
[0002]                     The present specification generally relates to equipment mounting systems for
mounting equipment in various configurations on a structure and, more specifically, a track
mounting system for mounting equipment in vehicles.
                                                 BACKGROUND
[0003]                     Mounting equipment and devices are dependent on the manufacturer mounting
locations for securing to third party structures. This may require individual adaptation for each piece
of equipment or device to mount to specific locations which may be time consuming and labor
intensive. Furthermore, if the piece of equipment or device is desired to be moved, the amount of
time and effort is increased to re-mount the piece of equipment or device in a new location. A
manufacturer may entertain adding quick mounting hardware to their equipment or devices for
addition money paid for by the customer but the new hardware may not be compatible with other
manufacturer's hardware.
[0004]                     The problem is compounded if the piece of equipment or device is desired to be
mounted in a vehicle such as an ambulance, helicopter, airplane, military vehicle, ATV, cart, etc.
The rigors that the securing fasteners must endure are increased over static applications.
Furthermore, the occupants of the vehicle may require relocation of the piece of equipment or device
away from a service area and without the need for tools.
[0005]                     Accordingly, a need exists for alternative approaches to secure and easily relocate
equipment or devices throughout and around a vehicle.

                                           DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0062]                       The following text sets forth a broad description of numerous different embodiments
of the present disclosure. The description is to be construed as exemplary only and does not describe
every possible embodiment since describing every possible embodiment would be impractical, if not
impossible, and it will be understood that any feature, characteristic, component, composition,
ingredient, product, step or methodology described herein can be deleted, combined with or
substituted for, in whole or part, any other feature, characteristic, component, composition,
ingredient, product, step or methodology described herein. Numerous alternative embodiments
could be implemented, using either current technology or technology developed after the filing date
of this patent, which would still fall within the scope of the claims.
[0063]                     Referring now to FIGS. 1 and 2, an illustrative embodiment of a track 10 for use in a
track system or similar track system is illustrated. While multiple tracks can be used, only one track
10 will be described as multiple tracks of the same track system may have the same or substantially
the same features. Furthermore the size, shape, and/or configuration of the track 10 can vary
depending on the size of a surface for installation and the equipment to be mounted to the track 10.
The track 10 includes a backing plate 15 that may have an elongated, rectangular shape (or any other
suitable shape) and three slots that extend at any length along the backing plate 15. The three slots
may be first outer slot 20, a center slot 25, and a second outer slot 30. The slots are best viewed in
FIG. 2 as T-shaped apertures running the length of or substantially the length of the backing plate 15.
The three slots are substantially parallel to each other. Each slot 20, 25 and 30 may have a series of
enlarged open regions 35 that are adjacent to necked-down regions 40. In some embodiments, the
enlarged open regions 35 are symmetrical such that they are spaced equidistant apart and are aligned
in widthwise rows along the length of the backing plate 15. For example, two open regions 35 in the
first outer slot 20 and two open regions 35 in the second outer region 30 may be spaced about 127
milli-meter (mm) (5 inches) apart. The 127 mm spacing may span any number of open regions 35 in
                                                               14
10183428 1 (GHMatters) P100321.AU.2

the slot (first outer slot 20 or second outer slot 30). To illustrate the flexible spacing, every third
open region may be space 127 mm apart. In yet another example, every fourth open region 35 may
be spaced 127 mm apart. The 127 mm spacing is for example purposes only and any desired spacing
of the open regions 25 may be used. As another example, the enlarged open regions 35 of one or
more of the slots 20, 25 and 30 may not all be equidistant and/or may not be aligned in rows with the
other enlarged open regions of the other slots.
[0064]                     The track 10 may include one or more mounting holes 55a, 55b, 55c, and 55d. The
mounting holes 55a, 55b, 55c, and 55d may be used to secure the track 10 to a surface using a
fastening device. Fastening devices include, but are not limited to, screws, bolts, rivets, nails,
adhesive, Velcro, weld, epoxy, or any similar devices that mechanically joins or affixes two or more
objects together.
[0065]                     FIG. 3 is a perspective back view of a mount 50. The mount 50 may take on many
different shapes and sizes and shown in the figures and described below. The mount 50 is an
interface between a piece of equipment and the track. The mount may have any number of mounting
studs 140 affixed to it to support the weight of the piece of equipment or device attached to it. More
mounting studs may be affixed to increase the load bearing capacity of the mount 50. The mount 50
may include apertures to reduce the weight of the mount 50. The mount 50 may also include
[0066]                     The mount 50 has a mounting plate 135, a back surface 165, a front surface 195, and
four mounting studs 140a, 140b, 140c, and 140d. The back surface 165 is on the opposite side of
mount 50 from the front surface 195. The mount 50 is operable to be removably connected and/or
attached to the track 10 or a fixed position plate. Each mounting stud 140a, 140b, 140c, and 140d
includes a respective stem portion 145a, 145b, 145c, and 145d and a respective enlarged head
portion 150a, 150b, 150c, and 150d. A locking pin 155 may be biased (e.g., by a spring, resilient
material, or other biasing means) outward towards an extended lock position for engaging the track
10 of FIG. 1, and more specifically the corresponding locking pin aperture on the fixed position
plate, a locking pin aperture 900 as found in FIG. 9, or the enlarged open region 35 of one of the
center slot 25 of the track 10. Alternatively to the locking pin 155 engaging only the center slot 25,
the locking pin 155 may be positioned on the mounting plate 135 to engage the first outer slot 20, the
second outer slot 25, or both. The locking pin 155 may be retracted using either individually or in
combination a right locking pin release lever 160b or a left locking pin release lever 160a which is
operatively connected to a release mechanism 190 of FIG. 7. It should be understood that both
                                                            15
10183428 1 (GHMatters) P100321.AU.2

locking pin releases levers 160a and/or 160b may be oriented in any direction in order to avoid
obstructions with other equipment or devices and yet still allow the release of the mount 50 from the
track 10. Furthermore, in some embodiments, two or more release levers may need to be actuated in
order to release the mount 50 from the track 10. Such an embodiment may provide for additional
security by preventing unwanted movement of the mounting plate 135 when one of the locking pin
releases levers 160a or 160b is accidentally actuated. The front surface 195 may have any device
and/or equipment attached to it.
[00671                     The mount 50 may be affixed to either the track 10 or the fixed position plate (not
shown) using an interference fit, a friction fit, or the lock pin 155 engaging either an open region 35
or a locking pin aperture 900 of FIG. 9. For example, the mounting studs 140 may rest at the bottom
of the necked down portion of the keyhole slots (not shown) of the fix position plate to attach the
mount 50 to the fixed position plate. In another example, the locking pin 155 may exert a biasing
force against the track 10 or the fixed position plate for the interference fit between the mount 50 and
the track 10 or fixed position plate. In yet another example, the locking pin 155, as described above,
may be used to immobilize the mount 50 in relation to either the track 10 or the fixed position plate
by engaging either a locking pin aperture 900 or an open region 35. It should be understood that the
track 10 and/or the fixed position plat are non-limiting examples of securing the mount 50.
[0068]                     Referring to FIG. 4, the track 10 and the mounting plate 135 illustrate an in-phase
configuration that is used to lock the mounting plate 135 to the track 10. Referring to FIG. 4, when
the enlarged head portions 1515a, 1515b, 1515c and 1515d of the mounting studs 1155a, 1155b,
1155c and 1155d of the mounting plate 135 are inserted within the enlarged head opening 1800a,
1800b, 1800c and 1800d of the slots 1610 and 1620, the locking pin 1500 is prevented from entering
the slot 1615 due to its alignment with the necked-down portion 1825a. In some embodiments,
placing the enlarged head portions 1515a, 1515b, 1515c and 1515d in the slots 1610 and 1620 causes
the locking pin 1500 to retract from its outwardly biased, extended position.
[0069]                     Referring to FIG. 5, the track 10 and the mounting plate 135 illustrate an out-of-phase
configuration. The stem portions 1510 (not shown) of the mounting studs 11 55a, 11 55b, 11 55c and
1155d are sized to slide through the necked down portion 1825 while the enlarged head portions
1515a, 1515b, 1515c and 1515d remain in the slots 1610 and 1620. Movement of the mounting
plate 135 downwardly (or upwardly) in the direction of arrow 1100 aligns the enlarged head portions
1515a, 1515b, 1515c and 1515d with necked-down regions 1825b, 1825c, 1825d and 1825e of the
                                                              16

slots 1610 and 1620 and aligns the locking pin 1500 with the enlarged head opening 1800e of the
slot 1615. The width of the locking pin 1500 may be greater than the upper passageway 1110 and
the lower passageway 1115 through the necked-down regions 1825f and 1825g adjacent the enlarged
head opening 1800e, which prevents further movement of the mounting plate 135 once the locking
pin 1500 passes through the enlarged head opening 1800e and into the slot 1615. In embodiments
where the locking pin 1500 is biased toward its extended position, the locking pin 1500 may snap
into its extended position automatically once the locking pin 1500 is aligned with the enlarged head
opening 1800e. An operator can retract the locking pin 1500 out of the slot 1615 by actuating any of
the locking pin releases 1160/1175 described above and again move the mounting plate 135 along
the track 10 to a different elevation.
[00701                     While FIGS. 4 and 5 illustrate a mounting plate 135 being secured to the track 10
using four mounting studs 11 55a, 1 155b, 1 155c, and 1 155d and one locking pin 1500, it should be
appreciated that any other number of studs and locking pins may alternatively be employed. Such an
embodiment may allow for a secured connection under increased loads by providing more points of
contact between the mounting plate 135 and the track 10. In another embodiment, the mounting
plate 135 may incorporate eight studs 1155 evenly distributed about the mounting plate 135. In yet
another embodiment, any other number of studs 1155 may be disposed on the mounting plate 125
that allows for a releasable connection with the track 10. The enlarged head portions 1515 are sized
to be received through open regions 1625 of the slots 1610, 1615, 1620 and to be captured behind
necked-down regions 1630 of the slots 1610, 1615, 1620, while the stem portions 1510 are sized to
pass by the necked-down regions 1630 of the slots 610, 115, 1620.
[00711                     The fixed position plate is an alternative to the track 10 of FIG. 1. A mount 50 of
FIG. 3 may be removably coupled to the fixed position plate. The fixed position plate may include
any suitable mounting structure or fastening device for securing it to a surface. Fastening devices
include but are not limited to screws, bolts, rivets, nails, adhesive, Velcro, weld, epoxy, or any
similar devices that mechanically joins or affixes two or more objects together. In this illustrative
embodiment, the fixed position plate incorporates four mounting holes, to secure the fixed position
plate to the surface. The fixed position plate also includes slots in the form of keyhole slots, each
with an enlarged head opening and a necked-down portion. The enlarged head opening of the
keyhole slots are sized and arranged to receive the enlarged head portions of the mounting studs
therethrough and the necked-down portions are sized to allow the stem portions to slide therein with
                                                             17
10183428 1 (GHMatters) P100321.AU.2

the enlarged head portions captured within the necked-down portions. The capture of the enlarged
head portions may be accomplished by an interference fit between the mounting studs and the
necked down portions of the first outer slot, or the center slot, or the second outer slot. A locking pin
aperture may be provided that is sized to receive the locking pin when the locking pin is aligned with
the locking pin aperture. The keyhole slots and the locking pin aperture are located as a mirror
image of the mounting studs of the mount.
[0072]                     FIG. 6 is a perspective front view showing the front surface 195 of another
embodiment of the mount 50. The mounting plate 135 has equipment mounting holes 170a, 170b,
170c, and 170d used to attach the mounting plate 135 to a piece of equipment (not shown) by any of
the fastening devices listed above. Although FIG. 6 only depicts four equipment mounting holes
170a, 170b, 170c, and 170d, any amount of equipment mounting holes 170, in any configuration,
may be used to accommodate the equipment or device to be mounted. The stud nuts 185a, 185b,
185c, and 185d are used to secure the mounting studs 140a, 140b, 140c, and 140d to the mounting
plate 135. The stud nuts 185a, 185b, 185c, and 185d may be any securing device and are not limited
to a nut. The release mechanism 190 is secured to the mounting plate 135 and has gearing inside to
pull in or push out the locking pin (e.g., locking pin 155 shown in FIG. 7) when one or both of the
locking pin releases 160a and/or 160b are actuated. In another embodiment, the release mechanism
190 may include gearing to actuate the locking pin 155 against the bias of a spring. One example of
how the release mechanism 190 works may be found in FIG. 7. The piece of equipment is secured
to the front surface 195 of the mounting plate 135.
[0073]                     FIG. 7 depicts one embodiment of the inner workings of the release mechanism 190.
The locking pin 155 is shown in the extended position and extending into the locking pin aperture 60
of the track 10. The track 10 may be the embodiment shown in FIG. 28a. The release mechanism
190 may be secured in a housing 715. A spring 720 provides the biasing force to extend the locking
pin 155 in the extended position. The locking pin 1555 may have include a lift pin 725 that is
disposed through a center of the locking pin 155. The lift pin 725 may be disposed such that to
provide a mechanical neutral balance point for moving the locking pin 155 without the locking pin
155 tilting or jamming within the housing 715.
[0074]                     A locking pin release 160 may be used to exert a force on the locking pin 155 and
against the biasing force of the spring 720 to transition the locking pin 155 from the extended
position to a retracted position. The retracted position is where the distal end 710 of the locking pin
                                                          18

155 is flush with the back surface 165 of the mounting plate 135. The locking pin release 160 may
have a ramp section 730 that, when the locking pin release 160 is transitioned towards the locking
pin 155, an upward force is exerted on the lift pin 725 to retract the locking pin 155. In other words,
when the locking pin release 160 is actuated, the locking pin 155 is transitioned to a retracted
position. The locking pin release 160 may include a return spring 735 to provide a biasing force to
return the locking pin release 160 to a locked position after actuation. The locked position is the
position of the locking pin release 160 in which the mount 50 will lock into position via the locking
pin 155 engaging the locking pin aperture 60.
[00751                     FIG. 7 also illustrates the engagement of the mounting studs 140 (i.e. 140a and 140b)
with the first outer slot 20 and the second outer slot 30.
[0076]                     Referring generally to FIG. 8, the mount 50 may include an adaptor, described in
greater detail below, coupled to the front surface 195 of the mounting plate 135 The adaptor
releasably couples with an equipment interface of a piece of equipment. The adaptor allows a user
to secure the mount 50 to the track without the bulk and/or weight of the piece of equipment making
the securing of the mount 50 difficult. In other words, the mount 50 may be mounted directly to a
piece of equipment and the engagement of the mount 50 with the track 10 may be complicated by
the size, shape, weight, or other factors of the piece of equipment. The adaptor is secured to the
mount 50. An equipment interface, described below, is used to couple the piece of equipment to the
adaptor.
[00771                     FIG. 8 depicts another embodiment of the mount 50. In this illustrative embodiment,
the adaptor is a second mounting plate 225 attached to the mounting plate 135. This embodiment
allows adaptors (described below), or other equipment, to be mounted to the track 10. The mounting
plate 135 may have any number of mounting studs 140 required to secure the mount 50 to the track
10. If the mount 50 is required to secure a heavy load, additional mounting studs 140 may be added
to increase the load capacity of the mount 50. In this embodiment, the mounting plate 135 has three
stud nuts 185a, 185b, and 185c used to secure three mounting studs 140a, 140b, and 140c to the
mounting plate 135.                 The three mounting studs 140a, 140b, and 140c may be in a triangle
configuration as shown in FIG. 8. Mounting studs 185b and 185c lie along a horizontal axis H and
mounting stud 185a lies along a vertical axis V. A midpoint M is the point along the horizontal axis
H and is equidistant between mounting studs 185b and 185c. The vertical axis passes through the
midpoint M. Mounting stud 185a is positioned to engage the open area 35 of the center slot 25 when
                                                             19
10183428 1 (GHMatters) P100321.AU.2

mounting studs 185b and 185c engage an open area 35 of the second outer slot 30 and the first outer
slot 20 respectively of the track 10. The locking pin associated with the locking pin release 190 may
also engage the open areas 25 of the center slot 25. The stud nuts 185a, 185b and 185c may be any
securing device and are not limited to a nut. The release mechanism 190 is secured to the mounting
plate 135 and has gearing inside to pull in or push out the locking pin (e.g., locking pin 155 shown in
FIG. 7) when one or both of the locking pin releases 160a or 160b are actuated. The second
mounting plate 225 is secured to the front surface 195 of the mounting plate 135 using a fastener 230
threaded into the equipment mounting holes 170 (not shown). It should be understood that the use of
the fastener 230 is a non-limiting example of a type of hardware that can be used to attach the second
mounting plate 225 to the mounting plate 135, in this case a screw. Other illustrative examples of
fasteners include, but are not limited to bolt/nut combinations, cotter pins, rivets, and any other
fastening mechanisms. The second mounting plate 225 may include two keyholes 220 disposed
therethrough for mounting equipment, devices, adaptors, and/or other items.
[0078]                     In one embodiment, the second mounting plate 225 may have a first surface 240 and a
second surface 245, the first surface 240 is opposite the second surface 245. A second release
mechanism (not shown) is coupled to the second surface 245. The second release mechanism is the
same in operation and configuration as the release mechanism 190 of FIG. 7. The second release
mechanism includes a second locking pin (not shown) disposed through the second mounting plate
225 and extending outwardly from the first surface 240 in an extended position. A second lock bias
spring (not shown) which biases the second locking pin 215 in the extended position, and at least one
second locking pin release (i.e. 210a and 2 1Ob) operatively coupled to the second locking pin 215
and when actuated, retracts the second locking pin 215 toward the second mounting plate 225 into a
retracted position and when released, allows the second lock bias spring to bias the second locking
pin 215 in the extended position.
[00791                     FIG. 9 illustrates one example of an equipment interface 172 used to couple with the
adaptor (i.e. second mounting plate 225) described above. A connect plate 980 may be used as the
support structure for the equipment interface 172. Equipment mounting apertures 170a, 170b, 170c,
and 170d may be used to secure a piece of equipment to the equipment interface 172. Although four
mounting apertures are shown, any number of mounting apertures may be used to properly secure a
piece of equipment to the equipment interface 172. The connect plate may also include a lock pin
aperture 905 disposed through the connect plate and at least one mounting stud coupled to the back
                                                            20

surface of the mounting plate, individual ones of the at least one mounting stud (i.e. 140a and 140b)
that includes a stem portion that extends outwardly from a connect surface 982 and an enlarged head
portion disposed at a distal end of respective stem portions. The one or more mounting studs 140a
and 140b, slideably couple with individual ones of the at least one keyhole slots (i.e. 220 of FIG. 8)
to secure the connect plate 980 to the second mounting plate 225. When in the locked position, the
second locking pin 215 engages the lock pin aperture 905 to restrict relative movement between the
connect plate 980 and second mounting plate 225.
[0080]                     In another embodiment of an equipment interface used with an adaptor, the connect
plate 980 may include two mounting studs 140a and 140b and a locking pin aperture 981 as
described above as well as a plurality of thumb screws. The thumb screws may be used to easily
attach a piece of equipment (not shown) without the need for separate mounting hardware, i.e. bolts,
screws, etc. The thumb screws may be of any configuration as required by the equipment to be
mounted may be used.
[0081]                     In another embodiment of an equipment interface, the equipment interface may serve
as an interface between two types of adaptors. For example, the connect plate 980 may have, on a
first side, one or more mounting studs 140 and a locking pin aperture 981 and a bowl adaptor
(described below) on a second side.
[0082]                     Another example of an equipment interface is a surface mount (not shown). The
surface mount may be secured to the track 10 via the mount 50 directly or via the adaptor described
above. The surface mount 250 is secured to the mount 50 via four fasteners 230. The surface mount
has a handle to aid in removing the surface mount from the track when the locking pin release is
actuated. The handle 265 also be used to hang an IV bag, wrap cords around or mount additional
pieces of equipment to. A plurality of holes is drilled into a body of the surface mount to reduce the
weight of the overall unit and organize and secure cords and other devices by routing them through
the plurality of holes. In this non-limited embodiment, the plurality of holes are placed and sized
where they will effectively reduce weight without weakening the structure of the body. A storage
compartment is included to hold a power cord of a piece of equipment mounted to the surface
mount.
[0083]                     In another embodiment, if the surface mount is directly mounted to the mount, the
surface mount is not functioning as an equipment interface and may include an adaptor mounted to
the body of the surface mount to secure a piece of equipment. The piece of equipment may
                                                           21
10183428 1 (GHMatters) P100321.AU.2

incorporate the equipment interface such as a tongue and groove interface. The piece of equipment,
the surface mount, and the mount would work as one unit. A mount fastener attaches the mount to
the surface mount.
[0084]                     In yet another example of an equipment interface a Sequal Eclipse mount may be
used to mount a Sequal Eclipse piece of equipment (not shown). Weight saving holes are place
throughout the Sequal Eclipse mount to save weight and material. Constraint tabs and a constraint
arm are used to keep the Sequal Eclipse equipment from moving and secure the Sequal Eclipse
equipment to the Sequal Eclipse mount. A pair of individual tie down mounts are coupled to a tie
down to capture the Sequal Eclipse equipment in the Sequal Eclipse mount. One of the tie down
mounts are attached to a tie down mast that elevates the tie down mount above the Sequal Eclipse
equipment. A cord holder with an access window is positioned below a deck where the Sequal
Eclipse equipment rests on. The cords from the Sequal Eclipse equipment are stored in the card
holder and are accessible through the access window. Sequal Eclipse fasteners are shown and used
to secure the Sequal Eclipse equipment to the Sequal Eclipse mount. For example, six Sequal
Eclipse fasteners may be used but they are not limited to six.
[0085]                     In another embodiment, if the Sequal Eclipse mount is directly mounted to the mount,
the Sequal Eclipse mount is not functioning as an equipment interface. The piece of equipment, the
Sequal Eclipse mount, and the mount would work as one unit. A mount fastener attaches the mount
to the Sequal Eclipse mount.
[0086]                     In yet another example of an equipment interface an equipment holder may be used to
hold portable equipment that is not mounted to the mount / track. For example, a portable ultrasound
machine, thermometer, calculator, etc. may be held in place by the equipment holder.                       The
equipment holder comprises a body with two retention tabs, two sidewalls, and a floor. The floor
and the sidewalls retain the piece of equipment in the equipment holder. A hole is centered in the
floor to facilitate weight savings and to allow the passage of cords or other devices through the body.
The two retention tabs constrain any upper lateral movement of the piece of equipment.
[00871                     In another embodiment, if the equipment holder is directly mounted to the mount, the
equipment holder is not functioning as an equipment interface. The piece of equipment, the
equipment holder, and the mount would work as one unit. In yet another embodiment, a mount
fastener may be used to attach the equipment holder directly to the track without the need for a
mount. An example of this technology may be found in FIG. 22. A pull pin is biased in a retention
                                                            22
10183428 1 (GHMatters) P100321.AU.2

position by a spring and an offset frame. The pull pin has a head that may mimic the shape of the
mounting stud to allow the equipment holder to be secured to track, or to a fixed position plate. The
offset frame may be used to provide a pressure surface to counteract the pressure exerted by the
spring on the head 54 when the head is engaged with the track. The offset frame also provides an
offset from the track so the pressure is not exerted directly on the body of the equipment holder.
[00881                       Focusing now on the mounting studs, another embodiment may include a single track
stud. The single track stud is used to mount a piece of equipment to the track 10 of FIG. 1 mounted
in a structure or vehicle. The single track stud comprises a mount head, a retaining collar, and a
collar. The mount head is circular is shape with a threaded body extending from its center. The
retaining collar and friction collar are rotated onto the threaded body. The collar has a collar
engagement surface. The mount head has a mount head engagement surface. When the mount head
is inserted into the track 10, the collar, may be rotated in a clockwise direction to enable the collar
engagement surface and the mount head engagement surface to apply pressure to the track 10 to
secure the single track stud from moving on the track 10.
[00891                     The single track stud is a versatile stud that enables a variety of configurations of
single track stud locations on the piece of equipment. The only limitation to those configurations is
that the single track stud locations must align with the slots (i.e. 20, 25, 30) and open regions 35 on
the track 10. When the single track stud is secured to the piece of equipment, the retaining collar is
rotated counter clockwise to apply pressure against the piece of equipment to ensure the threaded
body does not rotate out of the piece of equipment during use. The single track stud may include a
spring to provide the biasing force needed to apply the pressure against the track 10.
[0090]                     FIGS. 10A and 1OB, depict another embodiment of the adaptor as a universal adaptor
990. A receiver groove 2015 may allow the universal adaptor 990 to slideable couple with a piece of
equipment or other item with a tongue 2026 of FIG. 1OC that corresponds to the receiver groove
2015. The receiver groove 2015 is bounded by a plurality of guides 992a and 992b. The plurality of
grooves 992a and 992b matedly couple with the tongue 2026 and mimic a tongue and groove
coupler. A receiver equipment lock 2010 secures the tongue 2026 to the universal adaptor 990. A
receiver equipment release 2005, when actuate as shown by the arrows 2004, disable the receiver
equipment lock 2010 to allow the piece of equipment or tongue 2026 to be slideably decoupled from
the universal adaptor 990. A receiver locking pin 2020 may be biased (e.g., by a spring, resilient
material, or other biasing means) outward towards an extended, lock position for engaging the
                                                             23

associated track 10, and more specifically the corresponding locking pin opening 60 on the track 10.
The receiver locking pin 2020 may be retracted using a receiver mount release 2000. A plurality of
receiver studs 2025 may extend outwardly from one side of the universal adaptor 990. The plurality
of receiver studs 2025 may operate similarly to the mounting studs 140 of FIG. 7 to secure the
universal adaptor 990 to the track 10, fixed position plate 130, or similar mounting surface. The lever
2000 actuates the snubber function as described below. The snubber function is actuated along the
arrows 2002.
[0091]                     FIG. 1OC depicts another embodiment of the equipment interface 172. Equipment
mounting apertures 170a, 170b, 170c, and 170d may be used to secure a piece of equipment to the
equipment interface 172. The tongue 2026 is configured to releasably couple with the receiver
groove 2015 of FIG. 10A.
[0092]                     FIG. 11 depicts wedge mount 47 of a self-aligning mounting system. The wedge
mount includes the mounting plate 135, the back surface 165, the front surface 195, and four
mounting studs 140a, 140b, 140c, and 140d (not shown). The back surface 165 is on the opposite
side of mount 50 from the front surface 195. A first collar 53 is coupled to the back surface and
includes a bowl aperture 54. A capture plate 56 is coupled to the first collar 53 and includes a
keyhole slot aperture 57 that partially covers the bowl aperture 54. The keyhole slot aperture 57 has
a narrow end 75 and a wide end 70. The bowl aperture 53 and the keyhole slot aperture 57 define a
landing area 58 and a capture area 59. The landing area 58 is defined as where the keyhole slot
aperture 57 and the bowl aperture 53 are about the same size and the capture area 59 is defined as
where the keyhole slot aperture 57 is smaller than the bowl aperture 53. A wedge release 61 is
coupled to the first collar 53 and a wedge bias spring 102 (FIG. 13) is coupled between the first

associated parts to the mounting plate 135. Although four fastening devices 62a, 62b, 62c, and 62d
are shown, it should be understood that more or less number of fastening devices may be used. The
mount 50, as shown, is in a "X" shape that aids in weight reduction and also in observing the
engagement of the one or more mounting studs 140 with the slots (20, 25, and 30) of the track 10.
The wedge mount 47 may be mounted as an adaptor as described above instead of the structure
associated with the second mounting plate 225.
[0094]                     FIG. 12 illustrates the first collar 53 of the wedge mount 47. The wedge release 61
has a blade 64 that used to increase the surface area of the engagement surface 66. This increase
area aids in retaining a wedge interface 72 (FIG. 14) within the bowl aperture 54 and underneath the
capture plate 56. The wedge release 61 pivots around a pivot point 67. Referring back to FIG. 11,
the wedge release 61 has a handle 68 to aid in actuating the wedge release 61 between an unlocked
position and a locked position. The bowl aperture 54 has a plurality of guide walls 63 that are used
to center the wedge interface 72 when it is placed within the bowl aperture 54. The guide walls 63
surround the bowl aperture 54 and may be of any inclination to facilitate the centering of the wedge
interface 72.
[0095]                     FIG. 13 depicts a cross-sectional view of the wedge mount 47 where the cross-section
is taken right down the center of the center slot 25 of FIG. 1 of the track 10. The wedge interface 72
is shown seated in the wedge mount 47 with the wedge release 61 in the locked position. The wedge
released 61 is biased into the locked position by the spring 102.                     The blade 64 engages an
engagement trough 76 in an equipment plate 74 of the wedge interface 72. The pivot point 67 is
shown with a pin 71 used as the fulcrum point. The handle 68 would be actuated in an upward
direction along arrow T to actuate the wedge release 61 from the locked position to the unlocked
position. In the unlocked position, and referring to FIG. 12, the blade is flush with a bottom surface
69 of the bowl aperture 54.                 Comparing FIG. 12 to FIG. 13, the capture plate 56 provides a
protective cover for the pivot point 67 of the wedge release 61. Mounting holes 55a and 55b are
shown in the center slot 25 of the track 10, alternating with the locking pin apertures 60a and 60b.
                                                               25

include the equipment plate 74, a bowl 77, a plurality of capture guides 78a and 78b, and a wedge
79. The equipment plate 74 provides the mounting point for securing the wedge interface 72 to a
piece of equipment (not shown). The equipment plate 74 also provides one of two barriers to
capture the keyhole slot aperture 57 of the capture plate 56 as shown in FIG. 11. The other barrier is
the plurality of capture guides 78a and 78b. The capture space 82, between the equipment plate 74
and the plurality of guides 78a and 78b has a tolerance to allow the wedge interface 72 to slideably
couple with the capture plate 56 and not allow a lot of undue motion between the wedge interface 72
and the capture plate 56. The wedge 79 is situated between and couples the equipment plate 74 and
the plurality of capture guides 78a and 78b together. The wedge 79 has a lead-in surface 83 which is
configured to engage the keyhole slot aperture 57 and aid in rotational alignment of the wedge
interface 72 and the wedge mount 47. In other words, the lead-in surface 83 is configured to
rotational align the wedge interface 72 and the wedge mount 47 by ensuring the lead-in surface 83 is
the only part of the wedge interface 72 that may enter the capture area 59 of the keyhole slot aperture
57. The wedge 79 also includes a first incline surface 84 and a second incline surface 85. The first
incline surface 84 and the second incline surface 85 are opposite each other and are coupled to the
lead-in surface 83.
[0098]                     FIG. 15 is a side view of the wedge interface 72. The capture trough 76 is shown as a
notch on the bowl 77. The exit surface 87 has a slope that follows the same angle of the slope of the
bowl 77. The slope allows the bowl 77 to center the wedge interface 72 in the landing area 58 as
shown in FIG. 11.
[0099]                     A method to secure a piece of equipment to a wall may include securing a medical
device (not shown) to an wedge interface 72. The wedge interface 72 may include an equipment
plate 74, a bowl 77 with a plurality of capture guides 78a and 78b, and a wedge 79 coupled between
the equipment plate 74 and the bowl 77. A track 10, the minitrack 12, or quick mount track 11 may
be coupled to a wall (not shown) or other surface or structure. The mounting of a wedge mount 47
                                                             26

to the track 10 or 11 may be done by aligning one or more mount studs 140a, 140b, 140c, and 140d
on the wedge mount 47 with one or more diamond contoured target regions 13 and slideably
coupling the wedge mount 47 to a locked position where a locking pin 155 engages a locking pin
aperture 60. The wedge mount 47 with a back surface 165 and a front surface 195. The wedge
mount 47 includes a first collar 53 coupled to the front surface 195 and includes a bowl aperture 54,
a capture plate 56 coupled to the first collar 53 and includes a keyhole slot aperture 57 with a wide
end 70 and a narrow end 75 that partially covers the bowl aperture 54, the wide area 70 of the
keyhole slot aperture 57 and corresponding bowl aperture 54 define a landing area 58 and the narrow
end 75 of the keyhole slot aperture 57 and corresponding bowl aperture 54 define a capture area 59.
A wedge release 61 is coupled to the first collar 53. A wedge bias spring (i.e. spring 102) is coupled
between the first collar 53 and the wedge release 61 to bias the wedge release 61 in a locked
position. At least one mounting stud 140a, 140b, 140c, and 140d, are coupled to the back surface
165, each mounting stud 140a, 140b, 140c, and 140d may include a stem portion that extends
outwardly from the back surface 165 and an enlarged head portion disposed at a distal end of stem
portion. Aligning the wedge interface 72 to the wedge mount 47 is accomplished by pressing the
bowl 77 into the landing area 58 through the wide end 70 of the keyhole slot aperture 57 and into
bowl aperture 54 and allowing a plurality of guide walls 63 of the bowl aperture 54 to engage a
plurality of sloped sides of the bowl 77 which force the wedge interface 72 into alignment with the
wedge mount 47. Coupling of the equipment plate 74 with the wedge mount 47 is accomplished by
slideably moving the wedge 79 of the equipment plate 74 into the capture area 59 at the narrow end
75 of the keyhole slot aperture 57 until the capture plate 56 is secured between the equipment plate
74 and the plurality of capture guides 78. Locking the wedge interface 72 into the wedge mount 47
is accomplished by the wedge bias spring (i.e. spring 102) biasing the wedge release 61 in the locked
position. Unlocking the wedge interface 72 from the wedge mount 47 is accomplished by actuating
the wedge release 61 into an unlocked position and uncoupling the wedge interface 72 from the
wedge mount 47 by slideably moving the wedge 79 of the wedge interface 72 out of the narrow end
75 of the keyhole slot aperture 57 until the capture plate 56 is in the wide area 70 of keyhole slot
aperture 57. Removing the wedge interface 72 and hence the piece of equipment from the wedge
mount 47 is accomplished by pulling the bowl 77 out of the bowl aperture 54. It is to be noted that
vision of the alignment of the bowl 77 and landing area 58 is not required. The sloped surface or
sides of the bowl 77 allow the wedge interface 72 to center itself and the piece of equipment in the
                                                   27

landing area 58. The capture plate 56 also has a set of sloped surface surrounding the keyhole slot
aperture 57 that further guide the bowl 77 into the landing area 58.
[00100]                    FIG. 16a depicts a perspective view of the wedge interface 72. The one or more
fastening apertures 73a, 73b, and 73c may have a taper or ledge 89 to them to allow a fastening
device, described above, to secure the wedge interface 72 to the piece of equipment.
[00101]                    FIG. 16b depicts a bottom view of the wedge interface 72 with the bowl 77 removed.
The first include surface 84 and the second incline surface 85 provide in increasing or decreasing
thickness of the wedge 79 as you move along the vertical axis V. The shape of the wedge 79 may
about match the shape of the keyhole slot aperture 57 in the capture area 59 as shown in FIG. 11.
Therefore, as the wedge 79 is inserted into the capture area 59, either the first incline surface 84 and
the second incline surface 85 will contact the keyhole slot aperture 57 first and provide a momentum
to rotate the wedge interface 72 to align the wedge 79 with the narrow end 75 of the keyhole slot
aperture 59. When the wedge interface 72 is seated and the wedge release 61 is in the locked
position, the first incline surface 84 and the second incline surface 85 will contact both sides of the
narrow end 75 of the keyhole slot aperture 57. A contact surface 81 will contact the bottom 69 of the
bowl aperture 54. An exit surface 87 is wider than the lead-in surface 83 and wider than the narrow
end 70 of the keyhole slot aperture 57.

than one item to be hung or alternatively, allow for one heavy item to be hung by threading a strand
of material through both hooks.
[00114]                    In yet another embodiment, a task light or lamp assembly may be secured to the
equipment track mount 1700 and used to provide lighting in an enclosed area. The task light is
attached to a lamp assembly mount via a clamp and a post (not shown) inserted into a flexible neck
of the task light or lamp assembly. The lamp assembly mount is attached to the equipment track
mount via the use of two nuts on the threaded rods 1710a and 17 1Ob. The task light embodiment is
not limited to a light. The flexible neck may allow the attachment of other instrument besides a light
such as, for example, a magnifying glass, flashlight, mirror, reflector, or a clip or claw to hold
another instrument.
[00115]                    FIG. 26 depicts an IV bag mount 780 with a retention hook 750 at the top of a mast
805. The mast 805 may be attached to the bracket 680 of the IV bag Velcro® wrap 675 from FIG.
23. The mast may be attached to the equipment track mount 700. The IV bag (not shown) is hung
from the retention hook 750 and secured against the mast 805 via the belt 685 threaded through two
loop holes 800 and the secure strip 690.
[001161                    FIG. 27 depicts the track 10 with a plurality of target open regions 900 and non-target
open regions 902. The first outer slot 20 and the second outer slot 30 may include the target open
regions 900 to accommodate the mounting stud 140 of FIG. 3 or similar studs as for example the
second mount head 620 of FIG. 21. In some embodiments, the target open regions 900 allow the
mount 50 with a piece of equipment attached to it to slideably couple with the track 10 without the
need for line of sight alignment of the mounting studs 140 with the open regions 35 of FIG. 1. The
target open region 900 are larger in diameter and/or size than the non-target open regions 902, which
allows for more variability in the orientation of the mount 50 to the track 10 and still enables the
                                                             32

correct engagement between the track 10 and the mount 50.                 In alternative embodiments (not
shown), the track 10 may not include the non-target open regions 902. It may include only a certain
number of the target open regions 900 along tracks 20 and 30 and a neck down region running
between the certain number of target open regions 900. An example of this embodiment is found in
FIGS. 28A and 28B.
[001171                    FIGS. 28A and 28B depict the quick mount track 11. The quick mount track 11
includes a backing plate 15 with a center slot 25, a first outer slot 20, and a second outer slot 30. The
first outer slot 20 and the second outer slot 30 comprise a plurality of diamond contour target regions
13 that allow a round head of a t-shaped stud or mounting stud 140 of FIG. 3 to engage the first outer
slot 20 and the second outer slot 30 at an angle to the backing plate 15. The center slot 25 has a
plurality of locking pin apertures 60 (e.g. 60a and 60b) in the backing plate 15. The locking pin
apertures 60 are in horizontal alignment with the plurality of diamond contoured target regions 13.
the plurality of diamond contoured target regions 13 allow a mount 50 of FIG. 3 to be mounted to
the quick mount track 11 with a degree of misalignment that may come from the inability to see and
align the mount 50 to the open regions 35 of the track 10 of FIG. 1. The mount 50 may be rotated
slightly in relation to the quick mount track 11 and still the mounting studs 140 will engage the
plurality of diamond contoured target regions 13. As the mounting studs 140 are inserted into
plurality of diamond contoured target regions 13, the mount 50 will align to be parallel with quick
mount track 11. In other words, the plurality of diamond contoured target regions 13 allow for some
rotation in the mount 50 and still enable a successful engagement of the first outer slot 20 and the
second outer slot 30.
[00118]                    Furthermore, the plurality of diamond contoured target regions 13 will allow for
mount 50 to be inserted into the quick mount track 11 at an angle to the backing plate 15. In other
words, a user may insert the mounting studs 140a and 140b into the first outer slot 20 first before
rocking or aligning the mount 50 so that the mounting studs 140c and 140 d engage the second outer
slot 30. This functionality allows for a user to mount a heavy or bulky piece of equipment with the
need for a second user's help and allow for some misalignment (both rotation and angle) of the
mount 54 in relation to the backing plate 15. The backing plate 15 may also have a plurality of
mounting locations 17 to allow for fastening devices to secure the quick mount track 11 to a surface,
wall, or structure.

[00119]                    FIG. 29 depicts the track 10 with a plurality of lock holes 905. The center slot 25 as
shown in FIG. 1 may be replaced with the plurality of lock holes 905 to allow the locking pin 155 of
FIG. 3 to slideably couple an individual lock hole 905 to secure the mount 50 to the track 10. In
some embodiments, the first outer slot 20 and the second outer slot 30 may have the plurality of
target open regions 900 as shown in FIG. 27, but they are not required or the plurality of diamond
contoured target regions 13 as shown in FIGS. 28A and 28B.

outer slot 20 and the second outer slot 30 may have the plurality of target regions 900 but they are
not required as shown in FIG. 27 or the plurality of diamond contoured target regions 13 as shown in
FIGS. 28A and 28B. A flat surface 910 allows for the locking pin 155 of FIG. 7 to apply a biasing
force to an even surface to create an interference fit between the mounting studs 140 and the necked
down regions 40 of the first outer slot 20 and the second outer slot 30. The biasing force exerts a
force to separate the mount 50 from the track 10. The interference fit or friction fit of the mounting
stud 140 pressing against the slots (20, 25, and 30), is a fastening device that fastens two parts by
friction after the parts are pushed together. Furthermore, the snubber function outlined below in
FIG. 37 may also provide the necessary force to secure the mount 50 to the track 10 of FIG. 30.
[00121]                    FIG. 31 depicts a wall assembly 2050 incorporating the track 10 of FIG. 1, the
minitrack 12 of FIG. 38, or the quick mount track 11 of FIG. 28. The track 10 may include a
plurality of tabs 2070a and 2070b. The plurality of tabs 2070a and 2070b are shown running the
long dimension of the track 10 but it should be understood that the plurality of tabs 2070a and 2070b
may also run the short dimension of the track 10. The plurality of tabs 2070a and 2070b may
support a wall covering 2055 and keep the wall covering 2055 flush with the face surface 2078 of

[00128]                    FIG. 36 depicts a vehicle cab 2200. In this embodiment, the support structure 2080
provides the framework for the vehicle cab 2200. Cross members 2081 are added between the
support structure 2080 to add additional strength and rigidity to the vehicle cab 2200. The support
structure is coupled to the track 10 as shown in FIG. 31 and wall coverings 2055 span the distance
between each track 10 to provide a flush inner surface for the vehicle cab 2200. A cabinet 2100 is
shown attached to the tracks 10 as wells a case 2110. The case may also include plurality of
keyholes on its backside and mount to the track in a similar fashion as the cabinet 2100.
[00129]                    The vehicle cab 2200 but it should be understood that the any walled enclosure may
incorporate the wall assembly 2050 of FIG. 31. Furthermore, the tracks 10 are shown vertical in the
vehicle cab 2200 however they may also run horizontal and use the cross members 2081 in place of
the support structure 2080. An outer wall covering 2060 may also be used to cover the vehicle cab

[001301                    Referring to FIGS. 3, 1OB, 11, and 37, in one embodiment, the locking pin release
160a and 160b and the wedge release 61 may include a snubber function. The snubber function
allows the locking pin release 160a and 160b and the wedge release 61 to take up any slack between
the mount 50 and the track 10. For ease of mounting and unmounting the mount 50 to and from the
track, the tolerance between the mounting studs 140 and the slots (20, 25, and 30) are loose or not
very tight. Therefore, when mounted, the mount 50 may rattle or shake on the track 10, the
minitrack 12, or quick mount track 11. The snubber function either uses a plunger (2020 of FIG.
10B) to apply a pressure between the mount 50 and the track 10 or it retracts the mounting studs 140
into the mounting plate 135 to take up the loose tolerance between the mount 50 and the track 10.
[001311                    Referring now to FIG. 37, the wedge mount 47 is shown with the locking pin release
160a and 160b (160) are a single unit and rotate about a central axis. The locking pin release 160
has a locked position 133 and an unlocked position 131. In the unlocked position 131, the locking
                                                            36

pin release 160 is free to actuate towards or away from the track 10 to release the mount 50 from the
track 10 as described above. In the locked position 133, a stop 128 prevents the towards and away
movement of the locking pin release 160. As the locking pin release 160 is actuated (rotated) from
the unlocked position 131 to the locked position 133, a cam (not shown) either presses a plunger (not
shown) against the track 10 to take up the loose tolerance between the mount 50 and the track 10 or
it retracts the mounting studs into the mounting plate 135 as described above in the snubber function.
[00132]                    Furthermore, in another embodiment, the blade 64 has a different shape from the
blade 64 of FIG. 12 as well as the engagement surface 66. The narrower shape of the blade 64 and
engagement surface 66 of FIG. 37 enables the wedge release 61 to absorb greater shock loads
without breaking and conform to narrower wedge interfaces (not shown).
[001331                    FIG. 38 depicts another embodiment of universal adaptor 990 of FIGS. 1OA and 1OB.
A plurality of keyhole slot apertures 2012a, 2012b, and 2012c are shown to receive an equipment
mount 172 (not shown), where the different embodiments of the equipment mount 172 are described
above. The receiver equipment release 2005 releases the equipment mount 172 from the universal
adaptor 990 through a set of release pins (not shown) in the cavity of each of the plurality of keyhole
slot apertures 2012a, 2012b, and 2012c. The paddle latch 2011 actuates a pull-out pin 2013 to
release the universal adaptor 990 from the minitrack 12. The pull-out pin 2013 operates similarly to
the locking pin 155 of FIG. 3.
[00134]                    The minitrack 12 is another embodiment of the track 10 of FIG. 1. The mintrack 12
enables a smaller load to be mounted to a surface, wall, or structure.
[001351                    FIGS. 39A and 39B depict a quick release clip 3000. The quick release clip 300 has a
eyelet structure 2005 with an eyelet aperture 3003. The eyelet aperture 3003 may allow a strand of
material to hang from the quick release clip 3000, a latch, a clip, a rope or similar material, a
carabiner or the like to couple with the quick release clip 3000. The foot structure 3008 mimics the
footprint of two mounting studs 140 of FIG. 3 if they were placed in adjoining open regions 35 of
the track 10 of FIG. 1. A clip pin 3025 is biased towards the foot structure 3008 and mimics the
locking pin 155. A handle 3020 enables the clip pin 3025 to be pulled away from the foot structure
3008 to release the quick release clip 3000 from the track 10. A plurality of indents 3015a and
3015b allow the clip pin 3025 to lock the quick release clip 3000 between two necked down regions
40. In other words, when the quick release clip 3000 is in the out-of-phase position (refer to FIG. 5),
the adjoining necked down regions 40 occupy the plurality of indents 3015a and 3015b. The clip pin
                                                          37
10183428 1 (GHMatters) P100321.AU.2

3025 includes both sides of the clip pin 3025a and 3025b as well as both sides of the handle 3020a
and 3020b and they all move together as one piece.
[001361                    When the quick release clip 3000 is inserted into the track 10 in the in-phase
configuration, the clip pin 3025 contacts the face surface of the track 10 and does not occupy an
open region 35. The quick release clip 3000 is slid to the out-of-phase configuration and the clip pin
3025 is biased to be extended into the open region 35, thereby locking the quick release clip 3000 to
the track 10.
[001371                    It should be appreciated that as used through the application the mounting studs 140
may be replaced with the tongue 180 to allow different mounting configurations to be used between
all the embodiments. The size and orientation of the track 10 and modular plates 105 may vary
depending on the application. The number of mounting studs 140 or track slots 20, 25, 30 may also
vary depending on the application and load considerations. Furthermore, all the embodiment
disclosed herein, to include for example the track 10, the fixed position mount 130, the mount 50,
may be made from aluminum, steel, plastic, rubber, casting, or similar materials.
[001381                    It will further be appreciated that the track system may be modular in that a number
of components of the track system may be interchangeable, which can reduce assembly time,
complexity, and costs. Such modularity in the track system may allow for a more rapid and fluid
response to particular situations, which may improve the outcomes in some instances. The track
system configuration allows its use on a variety of different vehicles and/or other equipment, thus
providing the benefit of interchangeability and flexibility. Another benefit of the track systems
described herein is that they permit a user to install, remove, and/or reconfigure one or more pieces
of equipment with little-to-no visibility as the track system can be employed by tactile sensing only
(i.e., feel only).
[001391                    It will further be appreciated that the track 10, the minitrack 12, and the quick mount
track 11 may be scalable to accommodate different size and different configurations of mounting
studs. For example, the standard size may be 19.05mm (3/4 inch) holes (open regions 35 of FIG. 1)
on 25.4 mm (1 inch) center. The track 10, the minitrack 12, or quick mount track 11 may be
increased to 38.1 mm (1.5") holes on 50.8mm (2 inch) center. Alternatively, the track 10, the
minitrack 12, or quick mount track 11 may be decreased to 9.5mm (3/8 inch) holes on 12.7mm (1/2
inch) center which would correspond to the minitrack 12 of FIG. 38.
                                                               38
10183428 1 (GHMatters) P100321.AU.2

[001401                    In some embodiments, printed or painted indicia and/or tactile indicia (e.g. a location
indicator) may be used along with the track system. For example, a location indicator may be placed
alongside or even on the tracks 10. In some embodiments, a marker may be placed on the tracks 10
to allow for rapid adjustments of the antenna mount 100 with little to no visibility. The indicia may
be located on the tracks 10 or on the military vehicle 300.
[00141]                    The track system can be made out of any material of sufficient strength. It could be
made out of one piece of material or a casting. The studs on the mounting plate and the openings on
the tracks can be increased or decreased as needed to reach the desired mounting strength required
by the equipment and material used in the system's manufacture.
[00142]                    It will be appreciated that this system does not require tools to mount a piece of
equipment to a vehicle or other equipment. As set forth above, the ease of its use and installation
would allow the mounting of a piece of equipment in either daytime or nighttime operations. The
track system is designed so that the quick releases can be found in the dark and the piece of
equipment can be moved or removed under little-to-zero light conditions.
