This invention relates to cutting board apparatus having handle to assist a user holding it
when preparing food. The board comprises a body with opposite processing surfaces
spaced apart in parallel, and a circumferential surface extending between the outer
peripheries of the two processing surfaces. A flexible handle is fixed on to the body. The
handle has two spaced ends and a middle section located between the two ends, the ends
having fixing members passing through them and into in the body. When the two ends of
the flexible handle are fixed on the body, the middle section is spaced from the
circumferential surface of the body such that the flexible handle protrudes from the body in
an arched shape.

Field of invention
[01]         This invention relates to cutting board apparatus and means for holding by a
user when preparing food.
Background to the invention
[02]         Cutting boards are well known in the culinary arts for providing a surface on
which food items may be placed for cutting or shopping. The board provides a protective
barrier that prevents the cutting implement from striking or cutting the substrate below,
for example a table surface. There is a need for a portable cutting board that can be
carried around to different work areas of a kitchen without having to place it on a counter
top or table.
[03]         The preceding discussion of the background to the invention is intended to
facilitate an understanding of the present invention. However, it should be appreciated
that the discussion is not an acknowledgement or admission that any of the material
referred to was part of the common general knowledge in Australia or elsewhere as at the
priority date of the present application.
[04]         Further, and unless the context clearly requires otherwise, throughout the
description and the claims, the words 'comprise', 'comprising', and the like are to be
construed in an inclusive sense - that is to say, in the sense of "including, but not being
limited to" - as opposed to an exclusive or exhaustive sense - that is to say meaning
"including this and nothing else".

of the two processing surfaces; a flexible handle fixed on the body comprising two spaced
ends and a middle section located between the two ends; two fixing members passing
through the two ends of the flexible handle respectively and fixed in the body, wherein

the two ends of the flexible handle are fixed on the body, and the middle section is spaced
from the circumferential surface of the body such that the flexible handle protrudes from
the body in an arched shape.
[06]        In a preferred form of the invention, the flexible handle comprises a decoration
part and a contact part overlapping with each other,
[07]        In a preferred embodiment, the decoration part is made of leather and the

Detailed description of an embodiment of the invention
[013]        In the different accompanying drawings, identical reference numerals are used
to mark identical or similar elements. In addition, it should be understood that terms such
as "top", "bottom", "first", "second", "forward", "backward", "reverse", "front", "rear",

[014]        Referring to Figure 1, in a preferred embodiment of this invention, a cutting
board of the invention is generally denoted by the number 10 and shown in exploded
perspective view.
[015]        The board is defined by a wooden body 20, which is of disc-like round
shape. It has two generally flat processing surfaces 22, corresponding with the
major opposite surfaces of the disc. The processing surfaces are spaced apart
substantially to be in parallel. A circumferential surface 24 extends between the
outer peripheries of the two processing surfaces 22. A flexible handle 26 is fixed
onto the body on circumferential surface 24. The handle has two spaced ends 28
and a middle section 30 located between the two ends.                 The middle section
defines an outer surface 32 and an inner surface 34 facing circumferential wall
surface 24.
[016]        Associated with each end are pairs 36 of fixing members in the form of
threaded screws, passing through the two ends of the flexible handle respectively
and being driven to be fixed in the body. It will be appreciated that other fixing
means may be employed within the scope of the invention, for example tacks,
nails and the like.

                                             4
 [017]       Referring to Figures 2 to 4, the handle is shown fixed at its opposite
 ends 28 to the body to retain an arched, generally U-letter shape. In Figure 3, the
 board is shown hanging from a hook 38 when not in use for convenient vertical
 storage and accessibility.
 [018]       With the two ends of the flexible handle fixed on the body, close
 enough     to each other cause the middle section            30 to be spaced from
 circumferential surface 24 of the body, such that the flexible handle protrudes
 from the body in an arched shape, allowing a user to insert one or more fingers
 through the gap so formed between surfaces 34 and 24 for carrying, as shown in
 Figure 4.
 [019]       In the preferred embodiment of this description, flexible handle 30
 comprises a decoration part and a contact part overlapping with each other. The
 contact part is a layer of chamois on the inner side 34 of the handle. The
 decorative part lies on outer surface 32 and is made of leather, so that the handle
 has a laminated constructions.
 [020]       In other embodiments of the invention, the flexible handle may be
 made of any of a leather material, a rubber material and a combination thereof.
 [021]       The board described in the preferred embodiment of the invention is
 disclosed as being made of wood, but other suitable substances may be employed
 as alternatives, and example being a plastics material such as high density
 polyethylene.
[022]        These embodiments        merely   illustrate particular examples of the
apparatus of the invention providing a dual surface cutting board with means for
holding it in a desired orientation for use away from a supporting structure such
as a table. With the insight gained from this disclosure, the person skilled in the
art is well placed to discern further embodiments by means of which to put the claimed
invention into practice.
