 DEVICES, SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR LOCATING AND INTERACTING WITH
                             MEDICAMENT DELIVERY SYSTEMS
                           Cross-Reference to Related Applications
[1001]      This application claims priority to U.S.          Provisional  Application Serial No.
61/746,308, entitled "Devices, Systems and Methods for Locating and Interacting with
Medicament Delivery Systems," filed December 27, 2012, which is incorporated herein by
reference in its entirety.
                                           Background
[1002]      The embodiments described herein relate generally to a medical device, and more
particularly to a medicament delivery device, and/or a simulated medicament delivery device
having and/or associated with a wireless communication module. The embodiments described
herein also relate to devices for interacting with and/or monitoring (e.g., wirelessly) with such
medicament delivery devices and/or simulated medicament delivery devices via the wireless
communication module.
[1003]      Exposure to certain substances, such as, for example, peanuts, shellfish, bee venom,
certain drugs, toxins, and the like, can cause allergic reactions in some individuals. Such allergic
reactions can, at times, lead to anaphylactic shock, which can cause a sharp drop in blood
pressure, hives, and/or severe airway constriction. Accordingly, responding rapidly to mitigate
the effects from such exposures can prevent injury and/or death.           For example, in certain
situations, an injection of epinephrine (i.e., adrenaline) can provide substantial and/or complete
relief from the allergic reaction. In other situations, for example, an injection of an antidote to a
toxin can greatly reduce and/or eliminate the harm potentially caused by the exposure. Because
emergency medical facilities may not be available when an individual is suffering from an
allergic reaction, some individuals carry a medicament delivery device, such as, for example, an
auto-injector, to rapidly self-administer a medicament in response to an allergic reaction.
[1004]      As another example, naloxone is a medicament that prevents and/or reverses the
effects of opioids.      Known formulations of naloxone can be used, for example, to treat

    WO 2014/106096                                                                PCT/US2013/078071
                                                   2
respiratory depression and other indications that result from opioid toxicity.            For example,
known formulations for naloxone can be used to reverse and/or mitigate the effects of an
overdose of a drug containing opioids, such as, for example, prescription opioids like oxycodone
or illicit opioids like heroin. In such situations, it is desirable to deliver the naloxone formulation
quickly and in a manner that will produce a rapid onset of action. Known methods for delivering
naloxone intranasally or via injection, however, often involve completing a series of operations
that, if not done properly, can limit the effectiveness of the naloxone formulation. Moreover,
because naloxone is often administered during an emergency situation, even experienced and/or
trained users may be subject to confusion and/or panic, thereby compromising the delivery of the
naloxone formulation.
[1005]       As yet another example, glucagon is a medicament that is administered to treat
patients suffering from hypoglycemia. In certain situations, the onset of hypoglycemia can cause
the patient to lose motor coordination and/or lose consciousness.              Thus, glucagon is often
administered by a care giver during an emergency situation.
[1006]       In the above-identified examples, the individual requiring the medicament may be
inexperienced and/or may infrequently require medical intervention (e.g., in the case of a
naloxone delivery device), and thus may be forget to carry the medicament delivery device
and/or forget how to use the delivery device.            For example, to actuate some known auto
injectors, the user may be required to execute a series of operations. For example, to actuate
some known auto-injectors, the user must remove a protective cap, remove a locking device,
place the auto-injector in a proper position against the body and then press a button to actuate the
auto-injector. Failure to complete these operations properly can result in an incomplete injection
and/or injection into an undesired location of the body. If the medicament delivery device is not
available or if the individual is unable to properly operate the medicament delivery device,
important medical aid may not be properly delivered.
[1007]       The likelihood of improper use of known medicament delivery devices can be
compounded by the nature of the user and/or the circumstances under which such devices are
used. For example, many users are not trained medical professionals and may have never been
trained in the operation of such devices. Moreover, in certain situations, the user may not be the

    WO 2014/106096                                                           PCT/US2013/078071
                                                  3
patient, or primary care-giver, and may therefore have no experience with the medicament
delivery device. Similarly, because some known medicament delivery devices are configured to
be used relatively infrequently in response to an allergic reaction or the like, even those users
familiar with the device and/or who have been trained may not be well practiced at operating the
device. Finally, such devices are often used during an emergency situation, during which even
experienced and/or trained users may be subject to confusion, panic, and/or the physiological
effects of the condition requiring treatment.
[1008]      Additionally or alternatively, the individual requiring the medicament may be
incapacitated and unable to inform bystanders of the nature of the medical emergency, that a
medicament delivery device is available, and/or how to use the medicament delivery device. If
bystanders remain unaware of the availability and location of the medicament delivery device, or
are unable to administer the medicament, important medical aid may not be delivered. To
enhance the likelihood of proper use, some known medicament delivery devices include printed
instructions to inform the user of the steps required to properly deliver the medicament. Such
printed instructions, however, can be inadequate for the class of users and/or the situations
described above. Moreover, because some known medicament delivery devices, such as, for
example, auto-injectors, pen injectors, nasal delivery systems, wearable injectors or bolus pumps,
transdermal delivery systems, inhalers or the like, can be compact, such printed instructions may
be too small to read and comprehend during a situation requiring the need for immediate and
accurate administration.
[1009]       Furthermore, some known medicament delivery devices, such as, for example, auto
injectors, pen injectors, inhalers, and/or simulated medicament delivery devices are configured to
be carried with the user. Although such devices may improve the likelihood of compliance, such
portable devices can exacerbate the shortcomings described above (e.g., inadequate instructions
for use). Additionally, because such portable devices are small, there is an increased likelihood
that such devices will be forgotten and/or misplaced. Moreover, the cost and size constraints of
known devices prevents the inclusion of more detailed features to address the shortcomings
described herein. As one example, such portable medicament delivery devices may have limited
space for electronics. For example, unlike stationary devices, such as infusion pumps and the
like, compact medicament delivery devices may have              insufficient space for full-scale

    WO 2014/106096                                                             PCT/US2013/078071
                                                  4
computational devices, such as general purpose processors, large form-factor printed circuit
boards, and the like.
[1010]      In addition to the issues relating to improper use of medicament delivery devices,
monitoring the patient's compliance with known medicament delivery devices can also be
problematic.    For example, some known treatment regimens include multiple doses of a
medicament that must be administered in a timely fashion and/or in a particular order to ensure
effectiveness (e.g., certain vaccination regimens). Thus, monitoring the patient's compliance is
an important aspect in ensuring that the treatment method will be effective.           Some known
medicament delivery systems include a medicament delivery device and an accompanying
electronic system to assist the user in setting the proper dosage and/or maintaining a compliance
log. Such known medicament delivery systems and the accompanying electronic systems can be
large and therefore not conveniently carried by the user.       Such known medicament delivery
systems and the accompanying electronic systems can also be complicated to use and/or
expensive to manufacture..
[1011]      In addition, an extended shelf life may be desirable for some medicament delivery
devices, such as devices intended to be carried by a user on a daily basis. For example, an auto
injector intended to be carried by a user on a daily basis may be expected to work after weeks,
months, or years without user maintenance. As another example, known emergency-use auto
injectors are single-use devices that are expected to be carried for years before a potential use.
The disposable nature and/or extended shelf-life of such devices can further exacerbate the
shortcomings described above.       For example, the electronics of known stationary devices,
particularly known devices having electronic communication means (e.g., for compliance
tracking), may not be efficient enough to provide sufficiently long battery life for use in a
portable, extended shelf life device. Furthermore, efficient power management may be desirable
to extend the useful life of a medicament delivery device, particularly for a device having limited
battery capacity, limited or no user replaceable batteries, and/or limited or no charging capacity.
[1012]      As another way to enhance the likelihood of proper use, some known medicament
delivery devices are associated with simulated medicament delivery devices (e.g., "trainers") to
provide a method for users to practice using the medicament delivery device without being

    WO 2014/106096                                                          PCT/US2013/078071
                                                5
exposed to the medicament and/or needles typically contained therein.              Such simulated
medicament delivery devices, however, can also include inadequate use instructions as described
above.
[1013]     Thus, a need exists for medicament delivery systems and/or devices that allow a
medicament delivery device to be quickly identified and located, alert the user if the medicament
delivery device is forgotten, and provide instructions that can be easily understood by a user in
any type of situation. Additionally, a need exists for simulated medicament delivery systems
and/or devices that can provide instructions and that can be reused multiple times. Moreover, a
need exists for medicament delivery systems and/or devices that can provide compliance
information associated with the use of the device and/or that can communicate electronically
with other communications devices.
                                           Summary
[1014]     System and methods to facilitate wireless communications with medicament delivery
devices and simulated medicament delivery devices are described herein. In some embodiments,
a method includes producing, from an adapter, a first wireless signal characterized by a first
communication mode with a computing device when a portion of at least one of a medicament
delivery device or a simulated medicament delivery is disposed within the adapter.            An
indication is received when the portion of the medicament delivery device or the simulated
medicament delivery device is removed from the adapter.              A second wireless signal
characterized by a second communication mode with the computing device is produced in
response to the indication.     The second communication mode is different from the first
communication mode. The second communication mode can be, for example, a hold mode, a
sniff mode or a park mode.

                                     Detailed Description
[1055]      This application describes devices that are related to and/or can be used with the
devices and systems described in U.S. Patent No. 8,172,082, entitled "Devices Systems and
Methods for Medicament Delivery," filed Feb. 5, 2007, U.S. Patent No. 8,231,573, entitled
"Medicament Delivery Device Having an Electronic Circuit System," filed May 12, 2008, and
U.S. Patent 8,361,026, entitled Apparatus and Methods for Self-Administration of Vaccines and
Other Medicaments," filed November 10, 2009, each of which is incorporated herein by
reference in its entirety.
[1056]      The medicament delivery systems shown and described herein can be used in
conjunction with any suitable medicament delivery device and/or medicament container such
that the medicament delivery device and/or medicament container can be easily accessed,
identified and located, as described herein.    In some embodiments, the medicament delivery
device can be a medical injector, such as a pen injector, a prefilled syringe, an auto-injector,
nasal delivery device or the like.
[1057]      In some embodiments, an apparatus includes a medicament delivery device and an
electronic circuit system. The electronic circuit system includes a radio such that the apparatus
can be electronically linked to a computing device using a wireless protocol. The medicament
delivery device can have a first configuration and a second configuration. The radio can send a
signal characterized by a first communication interval when the medicament delivery device is in
the first configuration.    The radio can send a signal characterized by a second, different,
communication interval when the medicament delivery device is in the second configuration.

    WO 2014/106096                                                          PCT/US2013/078071
                                                10
[1058]      In some embodiments,       a method includes       producing a first wireless signal
characterized by a first communication interval when a medicament delivery device is in a first
configuration. An indication can be received indicating that the medicament delivery device has
transitioned from the first configuration to a second configuration.    A second wireless signal,
characterized by a second, different, communication interval can be sent in response to receiving
the indication that the medicament delivery device has transitioned from the first configuration to
a second configuration.    In some embodiments, the first communication interval is associated
with a first communication mode, and the second communication interval is associated with a
second communication mode. The first communication mode and/or the second communication
mode can be an advertising mode, a hold mode, a sniff mode or a park mode.
[1059]      In some embodiments, a non-transitory processor-readable medium includes code to
cause a processor of a device to produce a first wireless signal characterized by a first
communication interval when a medicament delivery device is in a first configuration. The non
transitory processor-readable medium includes code to receive an indication that the medicament
delivery device has transitioned from the first configuration to a second configuration. The code
(executed on a processor) can cause the device to produce a second wireless signal, characterized
by a second, different, communication interval in response to receiving the indication that the
medicament delivery device has transitioned.
[1060]      In some embodiments, an apparatus includes a radio, a memory and a communication
module. The radio is configured to electronically communicate with a computing device via a
wireless protocol (e.g., Bluetooth*).   The radio is configured to send a first wireless signal
associated with a first communication interval and a second wireless signal associated with a
second communication interval.      The memory is configured to store transition information
associated with a transition of a medicament delivery device from a first configuration to a
second configuration. The communication module, which is implemented in at least one of the
memory or a processing device, is configured to receive the transition information and
determine, based on the transition information, at least the second communication interval.
[1061]      In some embodiments, an apparatus includes an adapter configured to receive at least
a portion of a medicament delivery device or a simulated medicament delivery device.           The

    WO 2014/106096                                                           PCT/US2013/078071
                                                11
apparatus also includes an electronic circuit system having a sensor and a radio. The sensor can
detect when the adapter is removed from the medicament delivery device or the simulated
medicament delivery device. The radio can electronically communicate with a computing device
via a wireless protocol. The radio can send a first signal characterized by a first communication
interval when the adapter is coupled to the medicament delivery device or the simulated
medicament delivery device, and can send a second signal characterized by a second
communication interval when the adapter is not coupled to the medicament delivery device or
the simulated medicament delivery device. In some such embodiments, the medicament delivery
device or the simulated medicament delivery can include a second electronic circuit system
configured to produce an electronic output when the medicament delivery device or the
simulated medicament delivery device is actuated. In such embodiments, the adapter can include
a protrusion that can isolate the circuit of the medicament delivery device or the simulated
medicament delivery device from a battery when the adapter is coupled to the medicament
delivery device or a simulated medicament delivery device.
[1062]      In some embodiments, an apparatus includes an adapter configured to receive at least
a portion of a medicament delivery device or a simulated medicament delivery device.             The
medicament delivery device or the simulated medicament delivery device includes a first
electronic circuit system configured to produce an electronic output when the device is actuated.
The adapter has a protrusion configured to isolate at least a portion of the first electronic circuit
system from a power source when the portion of the at least one of the medicament delivery
device or the simulated medicament delivery device is disposed within the adapter.               The
apparatus further includes a second electronic circuit system coupled to the adapter. The second
electronic circuit system includes a radio configured to electronically communicate with a
computing device via a wireless protocol. The radio is configured to send a first signal when the
portion of the medicament delivery device or the simulated medicament delivery device is within
the adapter and a second signal when the portion of the medicament delivery device or the
simulated medicament delivery device is spaced apart from the adapter, the second signal
different from the first signal.
[1063]      In some embodiments, a method includes producing, from an adapter, a first wireless
signal characterized by a first communication mode with a computing device when a portion of

    WO 2014/106096                                                          PCT/US2013/078071
                                                 12
at least one of a medicament delivery device or a simulated medicament delivery is disposed
within the adapter.    An indication is received when the portion of the medicament delivery
device or the simulated medicament delivery device is removed from the adapter.           A second
wireless signal characterized by a second communication mode with the computing device is
produced in response to the indication. The second communication mode is different from the
first communication mode. The second communication mode can be, for example, a hold mode,
a sniff mode or a park mode.
[1064]       In some embodiments, a simulated medicament delivery device can produce an
indication associated with an operation of the simulated medicament delivery device.              In
response, a recorded speech output can be generated and information associated with the
operation can be stored in a memory. A training script can be updated based on the information
stored in the memory.
[1065]       In some embodiments, a method includes receiving an indication associated with an
operation from a set of operations associated with a simulated medicament delivery device. The
set of operations can be, for example, a series of operations to be taken when actuating an actual
medicament delivery device that corresponds to the simulated device.           In response to the
indication, a recorded speech output associated with a first training script is produced.
Additionally, in response to the indication, use information associated with the plurality of
operations associated with a simulated medicament delivery device is updated.          The method
further includes producing, in response to the updated use information, a second training script.
[1066]       In some embodiments, a method includes receiving at a first time a wireless signal
associated with a slave device. A first location associated with a master device at the first time is
determined. An alarm is produced when the wireless signal is not received within a time period
after the first time and a second location associated with the master device at a second time is
different from the first location by a distance.
[1067]       The term "about" when used in connection with a referenced numeric indication
means the referenced numeric indication plus or minus up to 10% of that referenced numeric
indication. For example, "about 100" means from 90 to 110.

[1068]      FIG. 1 is a schematic illustration of a medicament delivery system 1000 (also referred
to herein simply as "the system 1000") according to an embodiment. The system 1000 includes
a medicament delivery device 1100, an adapter 1210, a computing device 1510, and a remote
device 1610.
[1069]      The medicament delivery device 1100 can be any of the medicament delivery devices
described herein. The medicament delivery device 1100 can be any of the medicament delivery
devices described in further detail herein. For example, the medicament delivery device 1100
can be an auto-injector similar to the auto-injector 4000 described below with reference to FIGS.
3-34. In other embodiments, the medicament delivery device can be a pen-injector, a syringe, a
nasal delivery device (such a nasal spray device), an inhaler, etc. In yet other embodiments, the
device 1100 can be a simulated medicament delivery device (i.e., a device that is devoid of a
medicament and/or that can simulate the use of a corresponding actual medicament delivery
device).
[1070]      The adapter 1210 can be a housing, cover, case, and/or any other suitable device
operable to be coupled to, receive, and/or detect the medicament delivery device. The adapter
 1210 can be any of the covers, housings, kits and/or containers described in further detail herein.
The adapter 1210 includes an electronic circuit system coupled thereto. In particular, the adapter
 1210 includes a processor 1216, a memory 1218, a sensor 1214, and a radio 1212. The adapter
also includes a communication module 1220, a use (or history) module 1222 and a leash module
 1224.   Although shown as including each of the communication module 1220, the use (or
history) module 1222 and the leash module 1224, in other embodiments an adapter need not
include all (or any) of these modules. For example, in some embodiments, an adapter includes
only a leash module 1224, and is configured to perform the leash method associated therewith,
and need not include the use module 122 or the communication module 1220. Alternatively, in
other embodiments an adapter includes only the communication module 1220.
[1071]      The processor 1216, and any of the processors described herein, can be any suitable
processor for performing the methods described herein. In some embodiments, processor 1216
can be configured to run and/or execute application modules, processes and/or functions
associated with such a medicament delivery system 1000. For example, the processor 1216 can

    WO 2014/106096                                                       PCT/US2013/078071
                                               14
be configured to run and/or execute the communication module 1220, the use (or history)
module 1222 and/or the leash module 1224, and perform the methods associated therewith. The
processor 1216 can be, for example, a general purpose processor, a Field Programmable Gate
Array (FPGA), an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC), a Digital Signal Processor
(DSP), and/or the like. The processor 1216 can be configured to retrieve data from and/or write
data to memory, e.g., the memory 1218.        As described herein, in some embodiments, the
processor 1216 can cooperatively function with the radio 1212 and/or execute instructions from
code to provide signals to communicatively couple the adapter 1210 to the computing device
 1510 (e.g., via wireless communication) and/or any other computing entity via a network 1190.
In some embodiments, the processor 1216 is a Bluetooth* low energy (BLE) processor, such as
The Texas Instruments® CC2540 series of processors, the Broadcom* BCM43341 processor,
and/or any other processor suitable or configured specifically to execute the Bluetooth@ v4.0
low energy stack. A schematic of a Bluetooth* processor is shown in FIG. 2.
[1072]       In some embodiments, the processor 1216 can be operable to facilitate any suitable
communication mode with the computing device 1510 and/or any other computing entity (e.g.,
by executing the communication module 1220). Such modes can include, for example, an active
mode, hold mode, sniff mode, and/or park mode in accordance with the Bluetooth* wireless
protocol. Moreover, the processor 1216 can also be operable to engage in any suitable type of
data transfer, such as asynchronous connection-less logical transport (ACL), synchronous
connection-oriented link (SCO), and/or any other suitable means.
[1073]       The memory 1218 can be, for example, random access memory (RAM), memory
buffers, hard drives,     databases, erasable programmable read only memory (EPROMs),
electrically erasable programmable read only memory (EEPROMs), read only memory (ROM),
flash memory, hard disks, floppy disks, cloud storage, and/or so forth. In some embodiments,
the memory 1218 stores instructions to cause the processor 1216 to execute modules, processes
and/or functions associated with such medicament delivery system 1000.        For example, the
memory 1218 can store instructions to cause the processor 1216 to execute one or more of the
communication module 1220, the use module 1222 and/or the leash module 1224, and perform
the methods associated therewith.

    WO 2014/106096                                                           PCT/US2013/078071
                                                15
[1074]       The sensor 1214 can be a switch, an audible input sensor (e.g., a microphone), optical
sensor, and/or any other suitable input device. In some embodiments, the sensor 1214 can be
operable to monitor and/or measure the configuration and/or status of the medicament delivery
device 1100. The sensor 1214 can be operable to detect if the medicament delivery device 1100
is removed from the adapter 1210, if the medicament delivery device 1100 is actuated, and so
forth. For example, the sensor 1214 can include an electrical contact or switch operable to detect
(e.g., in conjunction with the processor 1216) when the medicament delivery device 1100 is
physically separated from the adapter 1210. As another example, the sensor 1214 can include a
microphone operable to detect (e.g., in conjunction with the processor 1216) a mechanical and/or
electronic sound associated with the actuation of the medicament delivery device, such as a
characteristic hiss of a compressed gas container being discharged and/or a sound emitted from a
speaker of the medicament delivery device 1100 (not shown).          As yet another example, the
sensor 1214 can include an optical sensor operable to detect the configuration of a status window
of the medicament delivery device 1100. For example, the sensor 1214 can be operable to detect
when a status window of the medicament delivery device 1100 turns color or opaque, which may
be associated with use of the medicament delivery device 1100.
[1075]       The radio 1212 (also referred to as a receiver, transmitter and/or transceiver) can be
operable to send signals to, and/or receive radio signals, such as Bluetooth @, ZigBee, WiFi,
cellular telephone signals, etc. In some embodiments, such as embodiments where the processor
1216 is Bluetooth @ processor, the radio 1212 can be integral with the processor 1216. In other
embodiments, the radio 1212 can include a processor distinct from the processor 1216. In some
embodiments, the radio 1212 can be operable to communicatively couple (also referred to herein
as "linking" or "pairing") the adapter 1210 to the computing device 1510 and/or any other
computing entity via a network 1190. The radio 1212 can include or be coupled to a ceramic
chip antenna, a stamped antenna, a sintered antenna, a PCB conductive trace antenna, and/or any
other suitable antenna.
[1076]       The communication module 1220 can be a hardware and/or software module (stored
in memory 1218 and/or executed in the processor 1216). As described in more detail herein, the
communication module 1220 is configured to receive an indication (e.g., from the sensor 1214)
and/or transition information associated with a change in status of the medicament delivery

     WO 2014/106096                                                         PCT/US2013/078071

device 1100 and determine, based on the indication or the transition information, a connection
and/or communications characteristic.      Such communication characteristics can include, for
example, a communication interval and/or connection interval (e.g., a time period between
successive signals or portions of a signal, such an "advertising interval," also referred to herein
as a "connection interval"), a communication mode (e.g., a park mode, sniff mode or the like),
etc.
[1077]       The use module 1222 can be a hardware and/or software module (stored in memory
 1218 and/or executed in the processor 1216). As described in more detail herein, the use module
 1222 is configured to receive an indication (e.g., from the sensor 1214) and/or use information
associated with a use or history of the medicament delivery device 1100 and produce a script
(e.g., a recorded speech instruction) based thereupon. In this manner, the use module 1222 can
facilitate the adapter    1210 and/or the medicament delivery device          1100 (or simulated
medicament delivery device) being a "smart" device that can produce updated instructions and/or
guidance based on the past history of usage.
[1078]       The leash module 1224 can be a hardware and/or software module (stored in memory
 1218 and/or executed in the processor 1216).      As described in more detail herein, the leash
module 1224 is configured to receive information associated with the connection (or pairing)
between the adapter 1210 and the computing device 1510 and produce an alarm based thereupon.
In some embodiments, the leash module 1224 can base the alarms on the position and/or location
of the adapter 1210 and/or the computing device 1510.
[1079]       The network 1190 can be a piconet, the Internet, an intranet, a local area network
(LAN), a wide area network (WAN), a virtual network, a telecommunications network, any other
suitable communication system and/or combination of such networks. The network 1190 can be
implemented as a wired and/or wireless network.
[1080]       The computing device 1510 can a mobile computing entity, such as a smart mobile
phone (e.g., an iPhone®, an Android® device, a Windows® phone, a Blackberry® phone, etc.),
a tablet computer (e.g., an Apple iPad@, a Samsung Nexus® device, a Microsoft Surface®
device, etc.), and/or any other suitable computing entity. The computing device 1510 includes a
processor 1516, a memory 1518, and a radio 1512.

    WO 2014/106096                                                         PCT/US2013/078071

[1081]      The processor 1516 can be, for example, a general purpose processor, a FPGA, an
ASIC, a DSP, and/or the like. The processor 1516 can be configured to retrieve data from and/or
write data to memory, e.g., the memory 1518, which can be, for example, RAM, memory
buffers, hard drives, databases, EPROMs, EEPROMs, ROM, flash memory, hard disks, floppy
disks, cloud storage, and/or so forth.
[1082]      The radio 1512 can be structurally and/or functionally similar to the radio 1212. In
some embodiments, the radio 1512 can include a processor (e.g., a Bluetooth@ processor)
distinct from the processor 1516.      In some embodiments, a short-range radio link can be
established between the computing device 1510 and the adapter 1210.            For example, the
computing device 1510 and the adapter 1210 can be paired via the Bluetooth@ wireless protocol.
In such an embodiment, as described in further detail herein, the computing device 1510 can be
operable to send and/or receive data from the adapter 1210 related to the medicament delivery
device 1100, such as data associated with use, preparation for use, status, and so forth.
Furthermore, the adapter 1210 and/or the computing device 1510 can be operable to determine
when a short-range communication link is broken (e.g., when the adapter 1210 is out of range of
the computing device 1510).
[1083]      The leash module 1524 can be a hardware and/or software module (stored in memory
 1518 and/or executed in the processor 1516).     As described in more detail herein, the leash
module 1524 is configured to receive information associated with the connection (or pairing)
between the adapter 1210 and the computing device 1510 and produce an alarm based thereupon.
In some embodiments, the leash module 1524 can base the alarms on the position and/or location
of the adapter 1210 and/or the computing device 1510.
[1084]      In some embodiments, such as an embodiment where the computing device 1510 is a
Bluetooth@ enabled mobile phone, the radio 1512 can be suitable to establish a short-range radio
link with the adapter 1210 and establish a long-range with another computing device (e.g., the
remote device 1610) via the network. For example, the radio 1512 can be a dual-function radio
and/or the computing device 1510 can include multiple radios to relay information associated
with the adapter 1210 (which may be equipped with only a short-range radio) to the remote
device 1610 using, for example, a cellular data network and/or a WiFi link to the Internet. In

    WO 2014/106096                                                           PCT/US2013/078071
                                                 18
other embodiments, the adapter 1210 may be equipped with a radio operable to communicate
with the remote device 1610 via the network 1190.
[1085]      The computing device 1510 can be operable to store (e.g., in the memory 1218)
information associated with the adapter 1210, such as connection time, medicament device 1100
use record, and so forth. In some embodiments, the computing device 1510 can be operable to
determine its location (e.g., via a global positioning system (GPS) sensor (not shown)). In such
an embodiment, the computing device 1510 can be operable to associate location data with
information associated with the adapter 1210, such as use data.
[1086]      The remote device 1610 can be any suitable computing entity, such as a server or
personal computer.    The remote device 1616 includes a processor 1616, which can be, for
example, a general purpose processor, a FPGA, an ASIC, a DSP, and/or the like. The processor
 1616 can be configured to retrieve data from and/or write data to memory, e.g., the memory
 1618, which can be, for example, RAM, memory buffers, hard drives, databases, EPROMs,
EEPROMs, ROM, flash memory, hard disks, floppy disks, cloud storage, and/or so forth. The
network module 1612 can be any suitable module operable to communicatively couple the
remote device 1610 to the network 1190.         For example, the network module 1612 can be a
network interface controller (NIC).
[1087]      In some embodiments, the remote device 1610 can be operable to receive reports
associated with the medicament delivery device 1100 from the adapter 1210 and/or the
computing device 1510 via the network 1190.          For example, the remote device 1610 can be
associated with a healthcare provider and/or emergency contact and used to monitor medicament
delivery device 1100 use and/or compliance.
[1088]      In some embodiments, the processor 1216 of the adapter 1210 and/or the processor
 1516 of the computing device 1510 (and any of the processors described herein) can be operable
to execute code to implement a wireless communications protocol. For example, the processor
 1216 and/or the processor 1516 can execute a Bluetooth@ stack (which may be stored in memory
 1218, 1518) having service, profile, and/or application layers operable to control and/or improve
connectivity, power management, and/or any other suitable feature associated with the
Bluetooth@ protocol. For example, as described in further detail herein, the processor(s) 1216,

    WO 2014/106096                                                            PCT/US2013/078071
                                                  19
 1516, can be operable to alter mode (e.g., from park to sniff, from sniff to active, or any other
suitable change),     alter communication type (e.g.,        from ACL communication to SCO
communication), alter advertising interval, and/or any other suitable communication parameter.
In this manner, in accordance with the methods described herein, the processor 1216 and/or the
processor 1516 can alter and/or implement a characteristic of the wireless communication in
response to a change associated with the medicament delivery device 1100 (or simulated
medicament delivery device). As one example, the processor(s) 1216, 1516 can be operable to
alter a communication mode from advertising a connectable status on a first channel (or set of
channels) to sending and/or receiving communication packets on a second channel (or set of
channels).
[1089]      As described in further detail herein, in some embodiments, the computing device
 1510 can be operable to track the location and/or status of the adapter 1210. For example, by
recording when the computing device 1510 is communicatively coupled to the adapter 1210,
which may be associated with location information, the computing device 1510 can provide an
indication of the last location at which it was linked to the adapter 1210.        Furthermore, the
computing device 1510 can be operable to use triangulation, homing, and/or any other suitable
technique to locate the adapter 1210 when the adapter 1210 is within radio range. In addition or
alternatively, the computing device 1510 can send a signal to the adapter 1210 operable to cause
the adapter to emit a noise or other signal to aid the user in locating the adapter 1210 (and the
medicament delivery device 1000).
[1090]      In some embodiments, as described in further detail herein, the computing device
 1510 and/or the adapter 1210 can include a leash functionality (e.g., implemented in the leash
module 1224 and/or the leash module 1524) such that when the communications between the
computing device 1510 and the adapter 1210 is disrupted (e.g., the communication device 1510
moves out of range and/or vice versa), the adapter 1210 and/or the communication device 1510
can generate an alert to notify a user that a link has been lost. For example, an individual may be
advised to carry a medicament delivery device, such as an epinephrine auto-injector, but may
rarely use the medicament delivery device. As a result, the user may occasionally forget to carry
the medicament delivery device, which can have serious consequences in the event of a medical
emergency.     If the user additionally carries the computing device 1510, and is less likely to

    WO 2014/106096                                                            PCT/US2013/078071
                                                 20
forget the computing device 1510 (for example, where the computing device 1510 is a mobile
phone that the user uses on a regular basis), a leash function can alert the user if the medicament
delivery device 1100 is forgotten. In some embodiments, the computing device 1510 and/or the
adapter 1210 can generate an alert any time the computing device 1510 is moved out of range of
the adapter 1210 (i.e., indicating that the adapter 1210 is not being carried together with the
computing device 1510). In another embodiment, the computing device 1510 can be operable to
verify its location (e.g. via GPS) and alert if the computing device 1510 is out of range of the
adapter 1210 and the computing device 1510 has moved a distance from the position where it
was last coupled to the adapter 1210. Such an embodiment can reduce false alarms, which may
be caused by radio interference, traveling only a short distance from the medicament delivery
device 1100, and so forth.      For example, the computing device 1510 can be configured to
produce an alert when it loses connectivity with the medicament delivery device 1100 and is
more than 1/8 of a mile from the last location at which the computing device 1510 was linked to
the adapter 1210.     Any other suitable threshold, such as 200 feet, 1/2 mile, 5 miles, etc. is
possible. In addition or alternatively, an alert can be generated if the communication link is lost
and the computing device 1510 is moving at more than a threshold velocity, such as 10 mph, 20
mph, 50 mph, etc. which may be associated with traveling by automobile. In this manner, the
leash feature may reduce false alarms that can occur where the user is within walking distance of
the medicament delivery device 1100 (e.g., the user may be walking within a large building and
the communications between the computing device 1510 and the adapter 1410 may be
temporarily disrupted.
[1091]      In some embodiments, as described in further detail herein, the computing device
 1510 and/or the adapter 1210 can include a status tracking functionality such that when the
medicament delivery device 1100 (and/or a simulated medicament delivery device 1100)
changes status, the adapter 1210 can adjust the communications protocol and/or characteristics.
For   example,    in some     embodiments,    the   adapter  1210    can   enhance    the  electronic
communications with the computing device 1510 by changing a signaling rate, signal power
and/or the information contained in a signal sent via the radio 1212 in response to the actuation
of the medicament delivery device 1100 (and/or a simulated medicament delivery device 1100).

    WO 2014/106096                                                           PCT/US2013/078071

[1092]      In some embodiments, for example, the adapter 1210 can be operable to switch
between several connection and/or communication modes (each of which may be associated with
different broadcast intervals, power consumption levels or the like). For example, the adapter
 1210 can have an off mode, where there is substantially no electrical activity (e.g., no power
draw) associated with the processor 1216 and/or the radio 1212. When the adapter 1210 is in the
off mode, there is no communications between the adapter 1210 and the computing device 1510
and/or the remote device 1610. In some embodiments, an electrical connection between a power
source (e.g., a battery) and the processor 1216 and/or the radio 1212 may be mechanically
isolated when the adapter 1210 is in the off mode. In other embodiments, the power source can
remain electrically coupled to the processor 1216 and/or the radio 1212, but communications
activity can be otherwise curtailed to limit power consumption.
[1093]      As another example, the adapter 1210 can be operable in a connectable mode where
the adapter 1210 is available to link with and/or is soliciting a link with the computing device
 1510. For example, when in the connectable mode, the adapter 1210 can repeatedly send a
signal to advertise its availability to establish a communication link (or "pair with") the
computing device 1510 via the radio 1212. In some embodiments, the advertising signal can be
sent in a non-periodic advertising interval, which can avoid synchronization with the computing
device 1510 (e.g., avoid the adapter 1210 advertising on a cycle that does not overlap with a
computing device 1510 "listening" cycle). In some embodiments, the advertising interval can be
based, at least in part, on the status of the medicament delivery device 1100. In this manner, the
adapter 1210 can control the electronic communications with the computing device 1510 to limit
the power consumption during periods when such communications are less likely. For example,
if the medicament delivery device 1100 is disposed within the adapter 1210 a relatively long
advertising interval (such as about 7 ins, about 10 ins, about 20 ins, about 152.5 ins, about
211.25 ins, about 500 ins, about 760 ins, about 1 s, about 5 s, 5 min, and/or any other suitable
interval therebetween) can be chosen. If, on the other hand, the medicament delivery device
 1100 has been removed from the adapter 1210, a relatively short advertising interval (such as
about 1 ins, about 3, ins, about lOms, about 20 ms and/or any other suitable interval) can be
chosen and/or power can be increased to the radio 1212.         In this way, the adapter 1210 can
conserve power when the medicament delivery device 1100 is not configured to deliver a

    WO 2014/106096                                                           PCT/US2013/078071
                                                 22
medicament, while prioritizing connectivity and/or reducing latency when the medicament
delivery device 1100 is poised to deliver a medicament.
[1094]      As another example, the adapter 1210 can have a connected mode, for example,
where the adapter 1210 is linked with the computing device 1510 (i.e., the adapter 1210 and the
computing device 1510 form a piconet). When the adapter 1210 is in the connected mode, the
adapter 1210 can periodically exchange messages with the computing device 1510 to maintain
the connection.     In some embodiments, the communication interval (i.e., the time interval
between successive signals and/or portions of a signal, also referred to herein as a "connection
interval") can be selected in accordance with a status of the adapter 1210 and/or medicament
delivery device 1100 to minimize power consumption. For example, the communication interval
can be 0.5 s, 1 s, 2 s, and/or any other suitable interval. In some embodiments, the adapter 1210
can selectively enter a particular "mode" of communications when connected with the computing
device 1510. For example, the Bluetooth® Low Energy protocol employs a sleep mode, a sniff
mode and park mode to facilitate conservation of power of the slave device (i.e., the adapter
 1210, in this example). In some embodiments, the adapter 1210 can selectively enter the sleep,
sniff, and/or park mode once connected, in response to a change in status of the medicament
delivery device 1100 (e.g., removed, armed, actuated) and/or if the data associated with the
medicament delivery device 1100 is not transferred for a period of time.
[1095]      In some embodiments, for example, the adapter 1210 can be configured such that the
radio 1212 is configured to send a first signal characterized by a first communication interval
and/or mode when the medicament delivery device 1100 is in a first configuration.          The first
signal can be, for example, an advertising signal characterized by a first advertising interval. In
other embodiments, the first signal can be a signal to maintain an already-exiting pairing
between the adapter 1210 and the computing device 1510.             The first configuration of the
medicament delivery device 1100 can be, for example, a "standby" configuration (when the
device is within and/or coupled to the adapter 1210). Alternatively, the first configuration can be
any other suitable configuration (e.g., an armed configuration, a "power off' configuration or the
like). The radio is configured to send a second signal characterized by a second communication
interval and/or mode when the medicament delivery device is in a second configuration. The
second communication interval can be different from the first communication interval.

    WO 2014/106096                                                         PCT/US2013/078071

[1096]      In some embodiments, the computing device 1510 can send a signal to the adapter
 1210 to cause the adapter to emit an audible output. In some embodiments, there may be limited
space in the memory 1218 of the adapter 1210 to store voice prompts and/or customized voice
prompts, and/or the memory 1218 may be ROM memory or another type of memory that is not
writeable and/or requires significant time, computational resources, and/or power to alter. In
such an embodiment, sending a signal from the computing device 1510, which may have more
memory and/or computational power, to cause the adapter 1210 to generate an output, can extend
the battery life of the adapter 1210 and/or can allow the adapter 1210 to be more flexible and/or
customizable than the processor 1216, the memory 1218. Such methods can further address the
power constraints of the adapter 1210 by using less power than if the output were generated
entirely by the adapter 1210.
[1097]      In other embodiments, the electronic configuration of the adapter 1210 can facilitate
methods of updating an instruction script and/or voice prompt stored in the memory 1218 of the
adapter 1210. For example, in some embodiments, the adapter 1210 can receive signals from the
computing device 1510 via the radio 1212 that include information associated with an instruction
script and/or voice prompt of the types described herein. This information can then be written to
the memory 1218, thus allowing the voice prompts to be updated using the wireless
communications capabilities described herein. These methods avoid the need to have the voice
prompts contained in a ROM mask, which can be difficult to update. Moreover, these methods
allow for the user to customize their voice prompts (e.g., with a specific user's voice, with
customized content or the like).
[1098]      In some embodiments, the adapter 1210 can be associated with a unique identifier
and/or part number. In such an embodiment, when the computing device 1510 pairs with the
adapter 1210 the computing device 1510 (e.g., by communicating with the remote device 1610,
which may include a database of adapters 1210) can retrieve information associated with the
medicament delivery device 1100, such as type of medicament, expiration date, particular use
instructions, and so forth.
[1099]      Although described as facilitating a user-implemented update to a voice prompt, in
other embodiments, the adapter 1210 (and any of the system described herein) can be configured

    WO 2014/106096                                                           PCT/US2013/078071
                                                24
to update the voice prompts based on the user's past history (e.g., via the use module 1222). In
this manner, the systems and methods described herein can be used to produce a "smart" or
"trainable" device.    In some embodiments, the medicament delivery device 1100 can be a
simulated medicament delivery device intended for use training a user in the operation of an
actual medicament delivery device.       In such an embodiment, the adapter 1210 (and/or the
simulated medicament delivery device 1100 itself) can be operable to detect whether the
simulated medicament delivery device was used properly. For example, via input received from
the sensor 1214 (and/or a series of sensors), the adapter 1210 can be operable to detect whether
the simulated medicament delivery device was properly armed, whether it was properly
positioned to simulate delivery of medicament, whether sufficient force was applied to actuate
the simulated medicament delivery device, whether the medicament delivery device was held in
position for a sufficient period of time, and so forth. The adapter 1210 can send a signal to the
computing device 1510 such that personalized instructions can be provided to the user by the
computing device 1510 and/or the adapter 1210. For example, if the user applies insufficient
force to actuate the simulated medicament delivery device, this information can be stored within
the memory 1218 and the adapter 1210, the simulated device 1100, and/or the computing device
 1510 can be operable to instruct the user to apply additional force and/or to remind the user that
insufficient force was applied in previous instances.      Furthermore, in some embodiments, a
record of simulated medicament delivery device use can be stored by the adapter 1210, the
computing device 1510, and/or the remote device 1610, such that personalized instructions in the
event the user attempts to use an actual medicament delivery device 1100.        For example, the
computing device 1510 can remind the user of mistakes made with a simulated medicament
delivery device, for example, to remind the user that he or she has a history of applying
insufficient force when practicing with the simulated medicament delivery device.        Similarly
stated, the computing device and/or the remote device 1610 can be operable to provide
information to the user of the medicament delivery device 1100 based on data associated with a
simulated medicament delivery device.
[1100]      In some embodiments, an application (executing on the processor 1516 of the
computing device 1510) can be operable to detect and/or pair with multiple adapters.           For
example, the communication device 1510 can be operable to detect one or more adapters
(coupled to medicament delivery devices) at a retail location, such as a pharmacy. In such an

    WO 2014/106096                                                           PCT/US2013/078071
                                                 25
embodiment, the computing device 1510 can send a signal to and/or receive a signal from the
remote device 1610 indicating the location of the adapters. The remote device 1610, in turn can
provide information to users (e.g., via the Internet) of the location of the adapters. Thus, the
remote device 1610 can be operable to provide, for example, to a user, sales rep, healthcare
professional, etc. information about the availability of a particular medicament delivery device or
particular type of medicament delivery device. Furthermore, in the event of a medicament recall
or expiration, the remote device 1610 can have a database of locations having the recalled or
expired medicament.
[1101]      The methods and systems described herein can be used in conjunction with any
suitable medicament delivery device. For example, FIGS. 3-34 show a medical injector 4000 as
another example of a delivery device that can be used in conjunction with and/or as a part of the
delivery systems and methods described herein. FIGS. 3-4 are perspective views of the medical
injector 4000 in a first configuration (i.e., prior to use). The medical injector 4000 includes a
housing 4110, a delivery mechanism 4500 (see e.g., FIG. 12), an electronic circuit system 4900
(see e.g., FIGS. 13-23), a cover 4200 (see e.g., FIGS. 24-25), a safety lock 4700 (see e.g., FIGS.
26-29) and a base 4300 (see e.g., FIGS. 30-31). A discussion of the components of the medical
injector 4000 will be followed by a discussion of the operation of the medical injector 4000.
[1102]      As shown in FIGS. 5-11, the housing 4110 has a proximal end portion 4140 and a
distal end portion 4120. The housing 4110 defines a first status indicator aperture 4150 and a
second status indicator aperture 4151.    The first status indicator aperture 4150 defined by the
housing 4110 is located on a first side of the housing 4110, and the second status indicator
aperture 4151 of the housing 4110 is located on a second side of the housing 4110. The status
indicator apertures 4150, 4151 can allow a patient to monitor the status and/or contents of a
medicament container 4560. For example, by visually inspecting the status indicator apertures
4150, 4151, a patient can determine whether the medicament container 4560 contains a
medicament and/or whether a medicament has been dispensed.
[1103]      As shown in FIGS. 9 and 10, the housing 4110 defines a gas cavity 4154, a
medicament cavity 4157 and an electronic circuit system cavity 4153. The gas cavity 4154 has a
proximal end portion 4155 and a distal end portion 4156. The gas cavity 4154 is configured to

receive the gas container 4570 and the release member 4540 of the medicament delivery
mechanism 4500 (see e.g., FIG. 12) as described in further detail herein.        The proximal end
portion 4155 of the gas cavity 4154 is configured to receive the gas container retention member
4580 of the proximal cap 4112 of the housing 4110, as described in further detail herein. The
gas cavity 4154 is in fluid communication with the medicament cavity 4157 via a gas
passageway 4144, as described in further detail herein, and the gas cavity 4154 is in fluid
communication with a region outside the housing 4110 via a safety lock aperture 4128.
[1104]      The medicament cavity 4157 is configured to receive a portion of the delivery
mechanism 4500. In particular, the carrier 4520, the moveable member 4530 and the needle
4512 of the medicament delivery mechanism 4500 are movably disposed in the medicament
cavity 4157. The medicament cavity 4157 is in fluid communication with a region outside the
housing 4110 via a needle aperture 4122.
[1105]      The electronic circuit system cavity 4153 is configured to receive the electronic
circuit system 4900. The housing 4110 has protrusions 4149 (see e.g., FIG. 8) configured to
stabilize the electronic circuit system 4900 when the electronic circuit system 4900 is disposed
within the electronic circuit system cavity 4153.     The housing 4110 also defines connection
apertures 4152 configured to receive connection protrusions 4171 of the electronic circuit system
4900, and aperture 4145 (see e.g., FIG. 6) configured to receive a portion of a protrusion 4174 of
the electronic circuit system 4900. In this manner, the electronic circuit system 4900 can be
coupled to the housing 4110 within the electronic circuit system cavity 4153.             In other
embodiments, the electronic circuit system 4900 can be coupled within the electronic circuit
system cavity 4153 by other suitable means such as an adhesive, a clip and/or the like.
[1106]      The electronic circuit system cavity 4153 is fluidically and/or physically isolated
from the gas cavity 4154 and/or the medicament cavity 4157 by a sidewall 4148. The sidewall
4148 can be any suitable structure to isolate the electronic circuit system cavity 4153 within the
housing 4110 from the gas cavity 4154 and/or the medicament cavity 4157 within the housing
4110. Similarly, the gas cavity 4154 and the medicament cavity 4157 are separated by a sidewall
4146. In some embodiments, sidewall 4146 can be similar to the sidewall 4148, which isolates
the gas cavity 4154 and the medicament cavity 4157 from the electronic circuit system cavity

    WO 2014/106096                                                            PCT/US2013/078071
                                                27
4153. In other embodiments the gas cavity 4154 can be fluidically and/or physically isolated
from the medicament cavity 4157.
[1107]      The proximal end portion 4140 of the housing 4110 includes a proximal cap 4112, a
speaker protrusion 4147 (see e.g., FIGS. 8 and 9), and cover retention protrusions 4142 (see e.g.,
FIGS. 4 and 6). The speaker protrusion 4147 is configured to maintain a position of an audio
output device 4956 of the electronic circuit system 4900 relative to the housing 4110 when the
electronic circuit system 4900 is attached to the housing 4110, as described herein.          Cover
retention protrusions 4142 are configured to be received within corresponding openings 4215 on
the cover 4200. In this manner, as described in more detail herein, the cover 4200 can be
removably coupled to and disposed about at least a portion of the housing 4110.
[1108]      As shown in FIG. 11, the proximal cap 4112 includes a gas container retention
member 4580 and defines a gas passageway 4144. The gas container retention member 4580 is
configured to receive and/or retain a gas container 4570 that can contain a pressurized gas. The
gas passageway 4144 is configured to allow for the passage of gas contained in the gas container
4570 from the gas cavity 4154 to the medicament cavity 4157, as further described herein. Said
another way, the gas passageway 4144 places the gas cavity 4154 in fluid communication with
the medicament cavity 4157.
[1109]      As shown in FIGS. 7 and 9, the distal end portion 4120 of the housing 4110 defines a
battery isolation protrusion aperture 4121, a needle aperture 4122, a safety lock actuator groove
4123, a safety lock aperture 4128, a base actuator groove 4124, base retention recesses 4125A,
4125B, and base rail grooves 4127. The battery isolation protrusion aperture 4121 is configured
to receive the battery isolation protrusion 4235 of the cover 4200 (see e.g., FIG. 25), as described
in further detail herein.
[1110]      The needle aperture 4122 is configured to allow the needle 4512 (see e.g., FIG. 12) to
exit the housing 4110 when the medical injector 4000 is actuated. The portion of the sidewall of
the housing 4110 that defines the needle aperture 4122 includes multiple sheath retention
protrusions 4126. In some embodiments, the sheath retention protrusions can interact with the a
plurality of ribs 4728 of the needle sheath 4720 (see e.g. FIG 29) to maintain a position of the

    WO 2014/106096                                                          PCT/US2013/078071

needle sheath 4720 relative to the safety lock 4700 when the safety lock 4700 is coupled to the
housing 4110 and/or when the safety lock 4700 is being removed from the housing 4110.
[1111]      The safety lock actuator groove 4123 is configured to receive an actuator 4744 of the
safety lock 4700. As described in more detail herein, the actuator 4744 is configured to engage
and/or activate the electronic circuit system 4900 when the safety lock 4700 is moved with
respect to the housing 4110. The safety lock aperture 4128 is configured to receive a safety lock
protrusion 4742 (see e.g., FIGS. 25 and 26). As described in more detail below, the safety lock
protrusion 4742 is received within an opening 4554 between extensions 4552 of a release
member 4540 such that activation of the medical injector 4000 is prevented when the safety lock
4700 is in place.    The safety lock 4700, its components and functions are further described
herein.
[1112]      The distal base retention recesses 4125A are configured to receive the base
connection knobs 4358 of the base 4300 (see e.g., FIG. 30) when the base 4300 is in a first
position relative to the housing 4110.       The proximal base retention recesses 4125B are
configured to receive the base connection knobs 4358 of the base 4300 when the base 4300 is in
a second position relative to the housing 4110. The base retention recesses 4125A, 4125B have a
tapered proximal sidewall and a non-tapered distal sidewall.      This allows the base retention
recesses 4125A, 4125B to receive the base connection knobs 4358 such that the base 4300 can
move proximally relative to the housing 4110, but cannot move distally relative to the housing
4110. Said another way, the distal base retention recesses 4125A are configured to prevent the
base 4300 from moving distally when the base 4300 is in a first position and the proximal base
retention recesses 4125B are configured to prevent the base 4300 from moving distally when the
base 4300 is in a second position. Similarly stated, the proximal base retention recesses 4125B
and the base connection knobs 4358 cooperatively prevent "kickback" after the medical injector
4000 is actuated.
[1113]      The base actuator groove 4124 is configured to receive an actuator 4311 of the base
4300. As described in more detail herein, the actuator 4311 of the base 4300 is configured to
engage the electronic circuit system 4900 when the base 4100 is moved with respect to the
housing 4110. The base rail grooves 4127 are configured to receive the guide members 4312 of

    WO 2014/106096                                                          PCT/US2013/078071
                                                 29
the base 4300. The guide members 4312 of the base 4300 and the base rail grooves 4127 of the
housing 4110 engage each other in a way that allows the guide members 4312 of the base 4300
to slide in a proximal and/or distal direction within the base rail grooves 4127 while limiting
lateral movement of the guide members 4312. This arrangement allows the base 4300 to move
in a proximal and/or distal direction with respect to the housing 4110 but prevents the base 4300
from moving in a lateral direction with respect to the housing 4110.
[1114]       FIG. 12 shows the medicament delivery mechanism 4500 of the medical injector
4000.    The medical injector 4000 is similar to the auto-injectors described in U.S. Patent
Application Serial Number 11/562,061, entitled "Devices, Systems and Methods for Medicament
Delivery," filed November 21, 2006, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
Accordingly, only an overview of the medicament delivery mechanism 4500 and related
operation of the medical injector 4000 is included below.
[1115]       The medicament delivery mechanism 4500 includes a needle 4512, a carrier 4520, a
movable member 4530, a medicament container 4560, a gas container 4570, and a release
member 4540. As described above, the needle 4512, carrier 4520, movable member 4530 and
medicament container 4560 are disposed within the medicament cavity 4157 of the housing
4110. The gas container 4570 and the release member 4540 are disposed within the gas cavity
4154 of the housing 4110.
[1116]       The release member 4540 has a proximal end portion 4542 and a distal end portion
4544, and is movably disposed within the distal end portion 4156 of the gas cavity 4154. The
proximal end portion 4542 of the release member 4540 includes a sealing member 4545 and a
puncturer 4541. The sealing member 4545 is configured to engage the sidewall of the housing
4110 defining the gas cavity 4154 such that the proximal end portion 4155 of the gas cavity 4154
is fluidically isolated from the distal end portion 4156 of the gas cavity 4154. In this manner,
when gas is released from the gas container 4570, the gas contained in the proximal end portion
4155 of the gas cavity 4154 is unable to enter the distal end portion 4156 of the gas cavity 4154.
The puncturer 4541 of the proximal end portion 4542 of the release member 4540 is configured
to contact and puncture a frangible seal 4573 on the gas container 4570 when the release member
4540 moves proximally within the gas cavity 4154, as shown by the arrow BB in FIG. 12.

    WO 2014/106096                                                          PCT/US2013/078071
                                               30
[1117]      The distal end portion 4544 of the release member 4540 includes extensions 4552.
The extensions 4552 include projections 4547 that include tapered surfaces 4549 and
engagement surfaces 4548. Further, the extensions 4552 define an opening 4554 between the
extensions 4552. The tapered surfaces 4549 of the projections 4547 are configured to contact
protrusions 4313 on a proximal surface 4310 of the base 4300 (see e.g., FIG. 30).             The
engagement surfaces 4548 of the projections 4547 are configured to extend through the safety
lock aperture 4128 of the housing 4110 and contact a distal surface of the housing 4110. In this
manner, the engagement surfaces 4548 of the projections 4547 limit proximal movement of the
release member 4540 when the engagement surfaces 4548 are in contact with the distal surface
of the housing 4110.
[1118]      The opening 4554 defined by the extensions 4552 is configured to receive the safety
lock protrusion 4742 of the safety lock 4700 (see e.g., FIG. 27). The safety lock protrusion 4742
is configured to prevent the extensions 4552 from moving closer to each other. Said another
way, the safety lock protrusion 4742 is configured to ensure that the extensions 4552 remain
apart and the engagement surfaces 4548 of the projections 4547 remain in contact with the distal
end portion 4120 of the housing 4110. In some embodiments, for example, the release member
4540 and/or the extensions 4552 can be constructed from any suitable material configured to
withstand deformation that may occur when exposed to a load over an extended period of time.
In some embodiments, for example, the release member 4540 and/or the extensions 4552 can be
constructed from brass.
[1119]      The gas container 4570 includes a distal end portion 4572 and a proximal end portion
4576, and is configured to contain a pressurized gas. The distal end portion 4572 of the gas
container 4570 contains a frangible seal 4573 configured to break when the puncturer 4541 of
the proximal end portion 4542 of the release member 4540 contacts the frangible seal 4573. The
gas container retention member 4580 of the proximal cap 4112 of the housing 4110 is configured
to receive and/or retain the proximal end portion 4576 of the gas container 4570. Said another
way, the position of the gas container 4570 within the gas cavity 4154 is maintained by the gas
container retention member 4580.

    WO 2014/106096                                                        PCT/US2013/078071
                                                31
[1120]      The medicament container 4560 of the medicament delivery mechanism 4500 has a
distal end portion 4562 and a proximal end portion 4566, and is configured to contain a
medicament.    The distal end portion 4562 of the medicament container 4560 contains a seal
4523. The seal 4523 is configured to burst when punctured by the proximal end 4516 of the
needle 4512, as described below. The proximal end portion 4566 of the medicament container
4560 is configured to receive a piston portion 4534 of the movable member 4530.
[1121]      The movable member 4530 of the medicament delivery mechanism 4500 is movably
disposed within the medicament cavity 4157.         The movable member 4530 includes a piston
portion 4534 having a plunger at the distal end portion of the piston portion 4534. The piston
portion 4534 is configured to move within the medicament container 4560. In this manner, the
piston portion 4534 of the movable member 4530 can apply pressure to a medicament contained
in the medicament container 4560. The piston portion 4534 can be constructed of a resilient,
durable, and/or sealing material, such as a rubber.
[1122]      The carrier 4520 of the medicament delivery mechanism 4500 includes a distal end
portion 4522 and a proximal end portion 4526. The medicament container 4560 is coupled to the
carrier 4520 via a "snap-fit" connection (not shown) such that the medicament container 4560
can move relative to the carrier 4520 between a first configuration and a second configuration
during an injection event. In the first configuration, the carrier 4520 is configured to move
within the medicament cavity 4157 such that movement of the carrier 4520 within the
medicament cavity 4157 causes contemporaneous movement of the medicament container 4560
within the medicament cavity 4157. The proximal end portion 4516 of the needle 4512 is spaced
apart from the seal 4523 of the medicament container 4560 when the carrier 4520 is in the first
configuration. In the second configuration, the medicament container 4560 releases from the
"snap-fit" causing the medicament container 4560 to move distally with respect to the carrier
4520, causing the proximal end portion 4516 of the needle 4512 to pierce the seal 4523. In this
manner, the needle 4512 can be selectively placed in fluid communication with the medicament
container 4560 to define a medicament delivery path (not shown).
[1123]      FIGS. 13-22 show the electronic circuit system 4900. The electronic circuit system
4900 of the medical injector 4000 includes an electronic circuit system housing 4170, a printed

    WO 2014/106096                                                            PCT/US2013/078071
                                                32
circuit board 4922, a battery assembly 4962, an audio output device 4956, two light emitting
diodes (LEDs) 4958A, 4958B and a battery clip 4910. As shown in FIG. 20, the electronic
circuit system 4900 is configured to fit within the electronic circuit system cavity 4153 of the
housing 4110. Accordingly, as described above, the electronic circuit system 4900 is physically
and/or fluidically isolated from the medicament cavity 4157, the gas cavity 4154 and/or the
medicament delivery device 4500. As described herein, the electronic circuit system 4900 is
configured to output an electronic output associated with the use of the medical injector 4000.
[1124]      The electronic circuit system housing 4170 of the electronic circuit system 4900
includes a distal end portion 4180 and a proximal end portion 4190. The proximal end portion
4190 includes connection protrusions 4171A and a battery clip protrusion 4173. The connection
protrusions 4171A extend from the proximal end portion 4190 of the electronic circuit system
housing 4170, and are configured to be disposed within the connection apertures 4152 of the
housing 4110, as described above. In this manner, the electronic circuit system 4900 can be
coupled to the housing 4110 within the electronic circuit system cavity 4153.              In other
embodiments, the electronic circuit system 4900 can be coupled to the housing 4110 by other
suitable means such as an adhesive, a clip and/or the like. As described in more detail herein, the
battery clip protrusion 4173 is configured to hold the battery clip 4910 in place.
[1125]      The proximal end portion 4190 of the electronic circuit system housing 4170 defines
multiple sound apertures 4191. The audible output device 4956 is disposed against the proximal
end portion 4190 of the electronic circuit system housing 4170 such that the front face of the
audible output device 4956 is disposed adjacent the sound apertures 4191.       In this manner, the
sound apertures 4191 are configured to allow sound from an audio output device 4956 to pass
from the audio output device 4956 to a region outside of the housing 4110.
[1126]      As shown in FIGS. 16 and 17, the distal end portion 4180 of the electronic circuit
system housing 4170 includes a connection protrusion 4171B, a stiffening protrusion 4174, and
defines an LED aperture 4181, an aperture 4172, a safety lock actuator groove 4182, and a base
actuator groove 4183. The LED aperture 4181 is configured to receive the LEDs 4958A, 4958B
such that a user can view the LEDs 4958A, 4958B, which are described in more detail herein.

    WO 2014/106096                                                           PCT/US2013/078071
                                                 33
[1127]       The connection protrusion 4171B extends from the distal end portion 4180 of the
electronic circuit system housing 4170, and is configured to attach the electronic circuit system
4900 to the housing 4110, as described above. The stiffening protrusion 4174 is configured to
have at least a portion received within and/or accessible via the aperture 4145 in the housing
4110 (see e.g., FIG. 6). The stiffening protrusion 4174 is configured to limit the bending (e.g.,
buckling) of the electronic circuit system housing 4170 when the electronic circuit system
housing 4170 is coupled to the housing 4110.          Moreover, a user can access the stiffening
protrusion 4174 via the aperture 4172. In this manner, for example, the user can disengage the
stiffening protrusion 4174 from the aperture 4145.
[1128]       The safety lock actuator groove 4182 of the electronic circuit system housing 4170 is
configured to be disposed adjacent the safety lock actuator groove 4123 of the distal end portion
4120 of the housing 4110. In this manner, the safety lock actuator groove 4182 of the electronic
circuit system housing 4170 and the safety lock actuator groove 4123 of the distal end portion
4120 of the housing 4110 collectively receive the actuator 4744 of the safety lock 4700, which is
described in more detail herein. Similarly, the base actuator groove 4183 of the electronic circuit
system housing 4170 is configured to be disposed about the base actuator groove 4124 of the
distal end portion 4120 of the housing 4110. The base actuator groove 4183 of the electronic
circuit system housing 4170 and the base actuator groove 4124 of the distal end portion 4120 of
the housing 4110 collectively receive the actuator 4311 of the base 4300, which is described in
more detail herein.
[1129]       The printed circuit board 4922 of the electronic circuit system 4900 includes a
substrate 4924, a first actuation portion 4926 and a second actuation portion 4946. The substrate
4924 of the printed circuit board 4922 includes the electrical components necessary for the
electronic circuit system 4900 to operate as desired. For example, the electrical components can
be resistors, capacitors, inductors, switches, microcontrollers, microprocessors and/or the like.
[1130]       As shown in FIGS. 21-23, the first actuation portion 4926 includes a first electrical
conductor 4934 and defines an opening 4928 having a boundary 4929. The opening 4928 of the
first actuation portion 4926 is configured to receive a protrusion 4746 of the actuator 4744 of the
safety lock 4700. The boundary 4929 of the first opening 4928 has a discontinuous shape, such

    WO 2014/106096                                                              PCT/US2013/078071
                                                  34
as, for example, a teardrop shape, that includes a stress concentration riser 4927.                The
discontinuity and/or the stress concentration riser 4927 of the boundary 4929 can be of any
suitable shape to cause the substrate 4924 to deform in a predetermined direction when the
protrusion 4746 of the actuator 4744 of the safety lock 4700 is moved relative to the opening
4928, as shown by the arrow CC in FIG. 22.
[1131]       The opening 4928 is defined adjacent the first electrical conductor 4934 that
electronically couples the components included in the electronic circuit system 4900. The first
electrical conductor 4934 includes a first switch 4972, which can be, for example a frangible
portion of the first electrical conductor 4934. In use, when the safety lock 4700 is moved from a
first position (see e.g., FIG. 21) to a second position (see e.g., FIG. 22), the actuator 4744 moves
in a direction substantially parallel to a plane defined by a surface of the first actuation portion
4926 of the substrate 4924. The movement of the actuator 4744 causes the protrusion 4746 to
move within the first opening 4928, as indicated by the arrow CC in FIG. 22. The movement of
the protrusion 4746 tears the first actuation portion 4926 of the substrate 4924, thereby
separating the portion of the first electrical conductor 4934 including the first switch 4972. Said
another way, when the safety lock 4700 is moved from its first position to its second position
(see e.g., FIG. 33), the actuator 4744 moves irreversibly the first switch 4972 from a first state
(e.g., a state of electrical continuity) to a second state (e.g., a state of electrical discontinuity).
Said yet another way, when the safety lock 4700 is moved from its first position to its second
position, the actuator 4744 disrupts the first electrical conductor 4934.
[1132]       The second actuation portion 4946 includes a second electrical conductor 4935 and
defines an opening 4945, having a boundary 4949 and a tear propagation limit aperture 4948. As
shown in FIGS. 20-23, the opening 4945 of the second actuation portion 4946 is configured to
receive a portion of an actuator 4311 of the base 4300. The boundary 4949 of the opening 4945
has a discontinuous shape that includes a stress concentration riser 4947.          The discontinuity
and/or the stress concentration riser 4947 of the boundary 4949 can be of any suitable shape to
cause the substrate 4924 to deform in a predetermined direction when the actuator 4311 of the
base 4300 is moved in a proximal direction relative to the opening 4945, as shown by the arrow
DD in FIG. 23.

    WO 2014/106096                                                             PCT/US2013/078071
                                                   35
[1133]      The second electrical conductor 4935 includes a second switch 4973 disposed
between the opening 4945 and the tear propagation limit aperture 4948, which can be, for
example, a frangible portion of the second electrical conductor 4935. In use, when the base 4300
is moved from its first position to its second position (see e.g., FIG. 34), the actuator 4311 moves
in a proximal direction, substantially parallel to a plane defined by a surface of the second
actuation portion 4946 of the substrate 4924. The proximal movement of the actuator 4311 tears
the second actuation portion 4946 of the substrate 4924, thereby separating the portion of the
second electrical conductor 4935 including the second switch 4973. Said another way, when the
base 4300 is moved from its first position to its second position, the actuator 4311 moves
irreversibly the second switch 4973 from a first state (e.g., a state of electrical continuity) to a
second state (e.g., a state of electrical discontinuity). The tear propagation limit aperture 4948 is
configured to limit the propagation of the tear in the substrate 4924 in the proximal direction.
Said another way, the tear propagation limit aperture 4948 is configured to ensure that the tear in
the substrate 4924 does not extend beyond the tear propagation limit aperture 4948.          The tear
propagation limit aperture 4948 can be any shape configured to stop the propagation of a tear
and/or disruption of the substrate 4924. For example, the tear propagation limit aperture 4948
can be oval shaped. In other embodiments, the proximal boundary of the tear propagation limit
aperture 4948 can be reinforced to ensure that the tear in the substrate 4924 does not extend
beyond the tear propagation limit aperture 4948.
[1134]      The battery assembly 4962 of the electronic circuit system 4900 comprises two
batteries stacked on top of one another. The battery assembly 4962 has a first surface 4964 and a
second surface 4966.       The first surface 4964 of the battery assembly 4962 can contact an
electrical contact (not shown) disposed on the substrate 4924. The second surface 4966 of the
battery assembly 4962 is configured to contact a contact portion 4918 of a distal end portion
4916 of a battery clip 4910. When both the electrical contact of the substrate 4924 and the
contact portion 4918 of the distal end portion 4916 of the battery clip 4910 contact the battery
assembly 4962, the batteries of the battery assembly 4962 are placed in electrical communication
with the electronic circuit system 4900. Said another way, when the electrical contact of the
substrate 4924 and the contact portion 4918 of the distal end portion 4916 of the battery clip
4910 contact the battery assembly 4962, the battery assembly 4962 is configured to supply
power to the electronic circuit system 4900.

    WO 2014/106096                                                             PCT/US2013/078071
                                                 36
[1135]       The battery clip 4910 (shown in FIG. 18) includes a proximal end portion 4912 and a
distal end portion 4916. The proximal end portion 4912 defines a retention aperture 4913. The
retention aperture 4913 is configured to receive the battery clip protrusion 4173 of the electronic
circuit system housing 4170.      In this manner, the battery clip protrusion 4173 maintains the
position of the battery clip 4910 with respect to the electronic circuit system housing 4170 and/or
the battery assembly 4962.
[1136]       The distal end portion 4916 of the battery clip 4910 includes a contact portion 4918
and an angled portion 4917.       As described above, the contact portion 4918 is configured to
contact the second surface 4916 of the battery assembly 4962 to place the battery assembly 4962
in electrical communication with the electronic circuit system 4900. The angled portion 4917 of
the distal end portion 4916 of the battery clip 4910 is configured to allow a proximal end portion
4236 of a battery isolation protrusion 4235 (see e.g., FIG. 25) to be disposed between the second
surface 4966 of the battery assembly 4962 and the contact portion 4918 of the distal end portion
4916 of the battery clip 4910. When the battery isolation protrusion 4235 is disposed between
the second surface 4966 of the battery assembly 4962 and the contact portion 4918 of the distal
end portion 4916 of the battery clip 4910, the electrical path between the battery assembly 4962
and the remainder of the electrical circuit system 4900 is severed, thereby removing power from
the electronic circuit system 4900. The contact portion 4918 of the distal end portion 4916 of the
battery clip 4910 is biased such that when the battery isolation protrusion 4235 is removed, the
contact portion 4918 will move into contact the second surface 4916 of the battery assembly
4962, thereby restoring electrical communication between the battery assembly 4962 and the
electronic circuit system 4900. In some embodiments, the battery isolation protrusion 4235 can
be repeatedly removed from between the second surface 4966 of the battery assembly 4962 and
the contact portion 4918 of the distal end portion 4916 of the battery clip 4910 and reinserted.
Said another way, the battery isolation protrusion 4235 and the battery clip 4910 collectively
form a reversible on/off switch.
[1137]       The audio output device 4956 of the electronic circuit system 4900 is configured to
output audible sound to a user in response to a use of the medical injector 4000.          In some
embodiments, the audible output device 4956 can be a speaker.            In some embodiments, the
audible sound can be, for example, associated with a recorded message and/or a recorded speech.

    WO 2014/106096                                                          PCT/US2013/078071
                                               37
In other embodiments, the audible instructions can be an audible beep, a series of tones and/or or
the like.
[1138]      In other embodiments, the medical injector 4000 can have a network interface device
(not shown) configured to operatively connect the electronic circuit system 4900 to a remote
device (not shown) and/or a communications network (not shown).               In this manner, the
electronic circuit system 4900 can send information to and/or receive information from the
remote device. The remote device can be, for example, a remote communications network, a
computer, a compliance monitoring device, a cell phone, a personal digital assistant (PDA) or the
like.   Such an arrangement can be used, for example, to download replacement processor
readable code from a central network to the electronic circuit system 4900.               In some
embodiments, for example, the electronic circuit system 4900 can download information
associated with a medical injector 4000, such as an expiration date, a recall notice, updated use
instructions or the like. Similarly, in some embodiments, the electronic circuit system 4900 can
upload compliance information associated with the use of the medical injector 4000 via the
network interface device.
[1139]      FIGS. 24 and 25 show the cover 4200 of the medical injector 4000. The cover 4200
includes a proximal end portion 4210 and a distal end portion 4230, and defines a cavity 4242.
The cavity 4242 of the cover 4200 is configured to receive at least a portion of the housing 4110.
The proximal end portion 4210 defines apertures 4215 configured to receive the cover retention
protrusions 4142 of the housing 4110 (shown in FIGS. 4 and 6). In this manner, the apertures
4215 and the cover retention protrusions 4142 of the housing 4110 removably retain the cover
4200 about at least a portion of the housing 4110. Said another way, the apertures 4215 and the
cover retention protrusions 4142 of the housing 4110 are configured such that the cover 4200 can
be removed from a portion of the housing 4110 and then replaced about the portion of the
housing 4110.
[1140]      The distal end portion 4230 of the cover 4200 includes a battery isolation protrusion
4235. The battery isolation protrusion 4235 includes a proximal end portion 4236 and a tapered
portion 4237.     The proximal end portion 4236 of the battery isolation protrusion 4235 is
configured to be removably disposed between the second surface 4966 of the battery assembly

    WO 2014/106096                                                            PCT/US2013/078071
                                                 38
4962 and the contact portion 4918 of the distal end portion 4916 of the battery clip 4910, as
described above.
[1141]      FIGS. 26-29 show the safety lock 4700 of the medical injector 4000. The safety lock
4700 of the medical injector 4000 includes a proximal surface 4740, a distal surface 4760
opposite the proximal surface 4740 and a needle sheath 4720. The safety lock 4700 defines a
needle sheath aperture 4770 and a battery isolation protrusion aperture 4775.          The battery
isolation protrusion aperture 4775 is configured to receive the battery isolation protrusion 4235
of the cover 4200 such that the battery isolation protrusion 4235 can be disposed within the
electronic circuit system cavity 4153 or the electronic circuit system 4900, as described above.
Similarly stated, the battery isolation protrusion aperture 4775 of the safety lock 4700 is aligned
with the battery isolation protrusion aperture 4121 of the housing 4110, such that the battery
isolation protrusion 4235 can be disposed within the electronic circuit system cavity 4153 when
the cover 4200 is disposed about a portion of the housing 4110.
[1142]      The proximal surface 4740 of the safety lock 4700 includes a safety lock protrusion
4742, a stopper 4743, an actuator 4744 and two opposing pull tabs 4741. As described above,
when the safety lock 4700 is in a first (locked) position, the safety lock protrusion 4742 is
configured to be disposed in the opening 4554 defined by the extensions 4552 of the distal end
portion 4544 of the release member 4540.         Accordingly, the safety lock protrusion 4742 is
configured to prevent the extensions 4552 from moving closer to each other, thereby preventing
proximal movement of the release member 4540 of the medicament delivery mechanism 4500
and/or delivery of a medicament.       The stopper 4743 of the safety lock 4700 is a protrusion
extending from the proximal surface 4740 of the safety lock 4700.             The stopper 4743 is
configured to contact a portion of the housing 4110 to limit the proximal movement of the safety
lock 4700 relative to the housing 4110. In other embodiments, the stopper 4743 can be any
structure configured to limit the proximal movement of the safety lock 4700.
[1143]      The actuator 4744 of the safety lock 4700 has an elongated portion 4745 and a
protrusion 4746. The elongated portion 4745 extends in a proximal direction from the proximal
surface 4740.    In this manner, the elongated portion 4745 can extend through a safety lock
actuator opening 4356 of the base 4300 (see e.g., FIG. 30) and within the safety lock actuator

    WO 2014/106096                                                           PCT/US2013/078071
                                                39
groove 4123 of the housing 4110 and the safety lock actuator groove 4182 of the electronic
circuit system housing 4170. The protrusion 4746 extends in a direction substantially transverse
to the elongated portion 4745 and/or substantially parallel to the proximal surface 4740 of the
safety lock 4700. As described above, the opening 4928 of the first actuation portion 4926 is
configured to receive the protrusion 4746 of the actuator 4744 of the safety lock 4700.
[1144]       The pull tabs 4741 of the safety lock 4700 include a grip portion 4747 and indicia
4748. The grip portion 4747 of the pull tabs 4741 provides an area for the user to grip and/or
remove the safety lock 4700 from the rest of the medicament delivery system 4700. The indicia
4748 provides instruction on how to remove the safety lock 4700. In some embodiments, for
example, the indicia 4748 can indicate the direction the user should pull the safety lock 4700 to
remove the safety lock 4700.
[1145]      As shown in FIG. 28, the needle sheath 4720 of the safety lock 4700 includes a distal
end portion 4724, a proximal end portion 4722 and a plurality of ribs 4728. The needle sheath
4720 can also define a lumen 4729. The lumen 4729 of the safety lock 4700 is configured to
receive the needle 4512. In this manner, the needle sheath 4720 can protect the user from the
needle 4512 and/or can keep the needle 4512 sterile before the user uses the medical injector
4000. The proximal end portion 4722 of the needle sheath is configured to contact the distal end
portion 4522 of the carrier 4520 of the medicament delivery mechanism 4500.
[1146]       The distal end portion 4724 of the needle sheath 4720 has an angled ridge 4725. The
angled ridge 4725 is configured to allow the proximal end portion 4722 of the needle sheath
4720 to irreversibly move through the needle sheath aperture 4770 of the safety lock 4700 in a
distal direction. Said another way, the angled ridge 4725 can be configured in such a way as to
allow the proximal end portion 4722 of the needle sheath 4720 to move through the needle
sheath aperture 4770 in a distal direction, but not in a proximal direction. The needle sheath
aperture 4770 has retaining tabs 4771 configured to engage the proximal end of the angled ridge
4725 when the needle sheath 4720 is moved in a proximal direction.             In this manner, the
retaining tabs 4771 prevent the proximal movement of the needle sheath with respect to the
safety lock 4700. Further, the retaining tabs 4771 are configured to engage the proximal end of
the angled ridge 4725 when the safety lock 4700 is moved in a distal direction. Said another

    WO 2014/106096                                                           PCT/US2013/078071
                                                40
way, as shown in FIG. 33, the needle sheath 4720 is removed from the needle 4512 when the
safety lock 4700 is moved in a distal direction with respect to the housing 4110.
[1147]      FIGS. 30-31 show the base 4300 of the medical injector 4000.          The base 4300
includes a proximal surface 4310, a distal surface 4330 and base connection knobs 4358. The
base 4300 defines a needle aperture 4350, a safety lock protrusion aperture 4352, a battery
isolation protrusion aperture 4354, a safety lock actuator opening 4356, and pull tab openings
4360. The needle aperture 4350 is configured to receive the needle 4512 when the medical
injector 4000 is actuated. The safety lock protrusion aperture 4352 of the base 4300 receives the
safety lock protrusion 4742 of the safety lock 4700. The battery isolation protrusion aperture
4354 of the base 4300 receives the battery isolation protrusion 4235 of the cover 4200 and the
stopper 4743 of the safety lock 4700. The safety lock actuator opening 4356 receives the safety
lock actuator 4744 of the safety lock 4700. The pull tab openings 4360 are configured to receive
the pull tabs 4741 of the safety lock 4700.
[1148]      The proximal surface 4310 of the base 4300 includes an actuator 4311, guide
members 4312, and protrusions 4313. The actuator 4311 is an elongate member configured to
engage the substrate 4924 of the electronic circuit system 4900. As described above, the opening
4945 of the second actuation portion 4946 is configured to receive the actuator 4311 of the base
4300. The guide members 4312 of the base 4300 are configured to engage and/or slide within
the base rail grooves 4127 of the housing 4110, as described above. The protrusions 4313 of the
base 4300 are configured to engage the tapered surfaces 4549 of the extensions 4552 of the
release member 4540.       As described in further detail herein, when the safety lock 4700 is
removed and the base 4300 is moved in a proximal direction with respect to the housing 4110,
the protrusion 4313 of the base 4300 are configured to move the extensions 4552 of the release
member 4540 closer to each other, actuating the medicament delivery mechanism 4500. As
described above, the base connection knobs 4358 are configured to engage the base retention
recesses 4125A, 4125B in a way that allows proximal movement of the base 4300 but limits
distal movement of the base 4300.
[1149]      As shown in FIG. 32, the medical injector 4000 is first enabled by moving the
medicament delivery device from a first configuration to a second configuration by moving the

    WO 2014/106096                                                           PCT/US2013/078071
                                                41
cover 4200 from a first position to a second position. The cover 4200 is moved from the first
position to the second position by moving it with respect to the housing 4110 in the direction
shown by the arrow EE in FIG. 32. When the cover 4200 is moved with respect to the housing
4110 in the direction EE, the battery isolation protrusion 4235 is removed from the area between
the battery clip 4910 and the second surface 4966 of the battery assembly 4962. In this manner,
the battery assembly 4962 can be operatively coupled to the electronic circuit system 4900 when
the cover 4200 is removed, thereby providing power to the electronic circuit system 4900.
[1150]      When power is provided, as described above, the electronic circuit system 4900 can
output one or more predetermined electronic outputs. For example, in some embodiments, the
electronic circuit system 4900 can output an electronic signal associated with recorded speech to
the audible output device 4956. Such an electronic signal can be, for example, associated with a
.WAV file that contains a recorded instruction instructing the user in the operation of the medical
injector 4000. Such an instruction can state, for example, "remove the safety tab near the base of
the auto-injector."  The electronic circuit system 4900 can simultaneously output an electronic
signal to one and/or both of the LEDs 4958A, 4958B thereby causing one and/or both of the
LEDs 4958A, 4958B to flash a particular color. In this manner, the electronic circuit system
4900 can provide both audible and visual instructions to assist the user in the initial operation of
the medical injector 4000.
[1151]      In other embodiments, the electronic circuit system 4900 can output an electronic
output associated with a description and/or status of the medical injector 4000 and/or the
medicament contained therein. For example, in some embodiments, the electronic circuit system
4900 can output an audible message indicating the type of medicament contained in the medical
injector 4000, the expiration date of the medicament, the dosage of the medicament or the like.
[1152]      As described above, the medical injector 4000 can be repeatedly moved between the
first configuration and the second configuration when the cover 4200 is moved repeatedly
between the first position and the second position respectively.      Said another way, the cover
4200 can be removed and replaced about the housing 4110 any number of times. When the
cover 4200 is moved from the second position to the first position, the battery isolation
protrusion 4235 is inserted between the battery clip 4910 and the second surface 4966 of the

    WO 2014/106096                                                              PCT/US2013/078071
                                                  42
battery assembly 4962, deactivating the electronic circuit system 4900.           When the cover is
moved from the first position to the second position a second time, the electronic circuit system
4900 is once again activated. In this manner, the cover 4200 can be removed and the electronic
circuit system 4900 can output an electronic output without compromising the sterility of the
needle 4512.
[1153]       After the cover 4200 is removed from the housing 4110, the medical injector 4000
can be moved from the second configuration to a third configuration by moving the safety lock
4700 from a first position to a second position. The safety lock 4700 is moved from a first
position to a second position by moving the safety lock 4700 with respect to the housing 4110 in
the direction shown by the arrow FF in FIG. 33. When the safety lock 4700 is moved from the
first position to the second position, the safety lock protrusion 4742 is removed from between the
extensions 4552 of the release member 4540, thereby enabling the medicament delivery member
4500. Moreover, as shown in FIGS. 21 and 22, when the safety lock 4700 is moved from the
housing 4110, the actuator 4744 of the safety lock 4700 moves in the direction CC as shown in
FIG. 22, irreversibly moving the first switch 4972 from a first state (e.g., a state of electrical
continuity) to a second state (e.g., a state of electrical discontinuity). When the actuator 4744 of
the safety lock 4700 moves irreversibly the first switch 4972 of the electronic circuit system
4900 to the second state, the electronic circuit system 4900 can output one or more
predetermined electronic outputs. For example, in some embodiments, a processor (not shown)
can output an electronic signal associated with recorded speech to the audible output device
4956.    Such an electronic signal can be, for example, associated with a recorded message
notifying the user of the status of the medical injector 4000. Such a status message can state, for
example, "The medical injector is now enabled."          The electronic circuit system 4900 can also
simultaneously output an electronic signal to one and/or both of the LEDs 4958A, 4958B,
thereby causing one and/or both of the LEDs 4958A, 4958B to stop flashing, change color or the
like.
[1154]       In some embodiments, the first actuation portion 4926 and the actuator 4744 can be
configured such that the actuator 4744 must move a predetermined distance before the actuator
4744 engages the boundary 4929 of the opening 4928. For example, in some embodiments, the
actuator 4744 must move approximately 0.200 inches before the actuator 4744 engages the

     WO 2014/106096                                                           PCT/US2013/078071
                                                 43
boundary 4929 of the opening 4928. In this manner, the safety lock 4700 can be moved slightly
without irreversibly moving the first switch 4972 of the electronic circuit system 4900 to the
second state.     Accordingly, this arrangement will permit the user to inadvertently and/or
accidentally move the safety lock 4700 without actuating the electronic circuit system 4900.
[1155]       In some embodiments, the electronic circuit system 4900 can be configured to output
the status message for a predetermined time period, such as, for example, five seconds. After the
predetermined time period has elapsed, the electronic circuit system 4900 can output an audible
message further instructing the user in the operation of the medical injector 4000. Such an
instruction can state, for example, "Place the base of the auto-injector against the patient's thigh.
To complete the injection, press the base firmly against the patient's thigh."             In some
embodiments, the electronic circuit system 4900 can simultaneously output an electronic signal
to one and/or both of the LEDs 4958A, 4958B, thereby causing one and/or both of the LEDs
4958A, 4958B to flash a particular color. In this manner, the electronic circuit system 4900 can
provide both audible and/or visual instructions to assist the user in the placement and actuation
of the medical injector 4000. In some embodiments, the electronic circuit system 4900 can be
configured to repeat the instructions after a predetermined time period has elapsed.
[1156]       As described above, in other embodiments, the medical injector 4000 can have a
network interface device (not shown) configured to operatively connect the electronic circuit
system 4900 to a remote device (not shown) and/or a communications network (not shown). In
this manner, the electronic circuit system 4900 can send a wireless signal notifying a remote
device that the safety lock 4700 of the medical injector 4000 has been removed and that the
medical injector 4000 has been armed.
[1157]       After the safety lock 4700 is moved from the first position to the second position, the
medical injector 4000 can be moved from the third configuration to a fourth configuration by
moving the base 4300 from a first position to a second position. The base 4300 is moved from
its first position to its second position by placing the medical injector 4000 against the body of
the patient and moving the base 4300 with respect to the housing 4110 in the direction shown by
the arrow GG in FIG. 34. Moving the base 4300 from the first position to the second position
causes the protrusions 4313 on the proximal surface 4310 of the base 4300 to engage the tapered

    WO 2014/106096                                                          PCT/US2013/078071
                                                44
surfaces 4549 of the extensions 4552 of the release member 4540, causing the release member
4540 to actuate the medicament delivery mechanism 4500 and deliver a medicament to a body of
a patient.
[1158]       When the base 4300 is moved from the first position to the second position, the
medicament delivery mechanism 4500 is actuated such that the puncturer 4541 of the release
member 4540 is brought in contact with and/or punctures the frangible seal 4573 of the gas
container 4570. In some embodiments, the movement of the release member 4540 can be caused
by a spring (not shown in FIG. 12).        After the frangible seal 4573 has been punctured, an
actuating portion of a compressed gas can escape from the gas container 4570 and flow via the
gas passageway 4144 into the medicament cavity 4157.          The gas applies gas pressure to the
movable member 4530 causing the movable member 4530 and the carrier 4520 to move in a
distal direction within the medicament cavity 4157. When the carrier 4520 moves distally within
the medicament cavity 4157, the carrier 4520 and the medicament container 4560 are in a first
configuration. Accordingly, as described above, the medicament container 4560 is connected to
the carrier 4520 by a "snap fit" connection. In this manner, the medicament container 4560 and
the needle 4512 contemporaneously move with movable member 4530 and/or the carrier 4520 in
a distal direction.  As described above, the proximal end portion 4516 of the needle 4512 is
connected to the distal end portion 4522 of the carrier 4520 and is spaced from the seal 4523 of
the medicament container 4560 when the carrier 4520 is in its first configuration. Said another
way, the medicament container 4560 and the needle 4512 do not define a medicament delivery
path when the carrier 4520 is in the first configuration. The movement of the needle 4512 in a
distal direction causes the proximal end portion 4516 of the needle 4512 to exit the housing 4110
and enter the body of a patient prior to administering a medicament.
[1159]      After the carrier 4520 and/or the needle 4512 have moved within the medicament
cavity 4157 a predetermined distance, the carrier 4520 and the medicament container 4560 are
moved from the first configuration to a second configuration. In the second configuration of the
carrier 4520, the medicament container 4560 is released from the "snap-fit" allowing the
medicament container 4560 and the movable member 4530 to continue to move in a distal
direction relative to the carrier 4520.    Said another way, the medicament container 4560 is
configured to slidably move within the carrier 4520 when the carrier is moved from the first

     WO 2014/106096                                                           PCT/US2013/078071
                                                    45
configuration to the second configuration. As the medicament container 4560 continues to move
within the carrier 4520, the proximal end portion 4516 of the needle 4512 contacts and punctures
the seal 4523 of the medicament container 4560. This allows the medicament contained in the
medicament container 4560 to flow into the lumen (not shown) defined by the needle 4512,
thereby defining a medicament delivery path.
[1160]       As the medicament container 4560 contacts the distal end of the carrier 4520, the
medicament container 4560 stops moving within the carrier 4520 while the movable member
4530 continues to move in a distal direction. This causes the piston portion 4534 of the movable
member 4530 to sealingly slide and/or move within the medicament container 4560 containing a
liquid medicament. As the piston portion 4534 of the movable member 4530 sealingly slides
and/or moves within the medicament container 4560, the piston portion 4534 generates a
pressure upon the medicament contained within the medicament container 4560, thereby
allowing at least a portion of the medicament to flow out of the medicament container 4560 and
into the lumen defined by the needle 4512. The medicament is delivered to a body of a user via
the medicament delivery path defined by the medicament container 4560 and the needle 4512.
[1161]       As described above, the actuator 4538 of the base 4300 actuates the electronic circuit
4900 to trigger a predetermined output or sequence of outputs when the base 4520 is moved from
its first position to its second position (see, e.g., FIGS. 19-23). When the actuator 4538 is moved
in a proximal direction relative to the opening 4945, as shown by the arrow DD in FIG. 23, the
electronic circuit system 4900 is actuated to output one or more predetermined electronic
outputs. For example, in some embodiments, the electronic circuit system 4900 can output an
electronic signal associated with recorded speech to the audible output device 4956.        Such an
electronic signal can be, for example, associated with an audible countdown timer, instructing
the user on the duration of the injection procedure. Said another way, if it takes, for example, ten
seconds to complete an injection, an audible countdown timer can count from ten to zero
ensuring that the user maintains the medical injector 4000 in place for the full ten seconds. In
other embodiments, the electronic signal can be, for example, associated with a recorded
message notifying the user that the injection is complete, instructing the user on post-injection
disposal and safety procedures, instructing the user on post-injection medical treatment or the
like. Such a status message can state, for example, "The injection is now complete. Please seek

    WO 2014/106096                                                            PCT/US2013/078071
                                                 46
further medical attention from a doctor."          The electronic circuit system 4900 can also
simultaneously output an electronic signal to one and/or both LEDs 4958A, 4958B, thereby
causing one and/or both LEDs 4958A, 4958B to stop flashing, change color or the like, to
provide a visual indication that the injection is complete. In other embodiments, the electronic
circuit system 4900 can send a wireless signal notifying a remote device that the injection is
complete. In this manner, a patient's compliance can be monitored.
[1162]      In some embodiments, the second actuation portion 4946 and the actuator 4538 can
be configured such that the base 4500 and/or the actuator 4538 must move a predetermined
distance before the actuator 4538 engages the boundary 4949 of the opening 4945. For example,
in some embodiments, the actuator 4538 must move approximately 0.200 inches before the
actuator 4538 engages the boundary 4949 of the opening 4945. In this manner, the base 4700
can be moved slightly without irreversibly moving the second switch 4973 of the electronic
circuit system 4900 to the second state. Accordingly, this arrangement will permit the user to
inadvertently and/or accidentally move the base 4500 without actuating the electronic circuit
system 4900.
[1163]      FIG. 35 depicts a medicament delivery device 100 (e.g., any suitable device, such as
the medicament injectors and/or simulated devices described above with reference to FIGS. 1
35), an adapter 120 and a monitor device 150. The medicament delivery device 100 can be
paired with and/or cooperatively function with the adapter 120 and/or the monitor device 150 to
"page," locate and/or otherwise assist a patient and/or third party in determining the identity
and/or location of the medicament delivery device 100. The monitor device 150 can be any
suitable device that is operable to send a signal to the adapter 120 causing the adapter 120 to emit
a sound or other signal.     In this manner, the monitor device 150 and the adapter 120 can
cooperatively function to alert the user to the location of the medicament delivery device 100. In
other embodiments, according to the methods described herein, the monitor 150 can produce an
alarm (e.g., an audible alarm, a visual alarm or a vibratory alarm) to indicate a loss of
communications with the adapter 120, thus alerting the user to the possibility that the user may
be forgetting to carry the adapter 120.

    WO 2014/106096                                                          PCT/US2013/078071
                                                 47
[1164]      The adapter 120 can be coupled to the medicament delivery device 100. The adapter
 120 can, for example, be a sleeve, case, insert, attachment, and/or docking station coupled to the
medicament delivery device 100, a housing of the medicament delivery device 100 (such as the
housing 4100 described above) and/or electronic circuitry of the medicament delivery device 100
(such as the electronic circuit system 4900 described above). In some embodiments, the adapter
 120 can be removably coupled to and substantially surround a portion of the medicament
delivery device 100, similar to the covers 14200 and/or 4200 shown and described herein. In
other embodiments, an adapter 120 can be attached to an outer surface of a medicament delivery
device 100 without surrounding or covering a significant portion of the medicament delivery
device. In yet other embodiments, an adapter 120 can be inserted completely or partially into an
inside chamber of a medicament delivery device. In yet other embodiments, an adapter 120 can
be fixedly coupled to an outer surface of a medicament delivery device. Although shown as
being a separate component, in some embodiments, an adapter 120 can be integral with the
medicament delivery device 100.       Said another, in some embodiments, the function of the
adapter 120 described below can be included within a housing and/or electronic circuit system of
the medicament delivery device 100.
[1165]      The adapter 120 can include a radio 122 (also referred to as a receiver, transmitter
and/or transceiver) and/or an audible output device 124. The radio 122 of the adapter 120 can be
operable to send signals to, and/or receive signals from the monitor device 150 in accordance
with any of the methods described herein. For example, although not shown in FIG. 35, in some
embodiments, the adapter 120 can include a processor, a memory, a communication module, a
leash module and/or a use module, as describe above with respect to FIG. 1.
[1166]      The audible output device 124 of the adapter 120 can be operable to emit an audible
output, such as a tone and/or recorded speech instructions. As discussed in further detail herein,
in some embodiments, the adapter 120 can include a sensor (or switch) 126 operable to detect an
event associated with the medicament delivery device 100.           Such events can include, for
example, when the medicament delivery device 100 is used and/or is prepared for use. In this
manner, the sensor 126 can detect the status and/or usage history of the medicament delivery
device 100.    For example, in some embodiments, the adapter 120 can be a sleeve or cover
(similar to the cover 4200 shown and described above) that is removed from the medicament

    WO 2014/106096                                                            PCT/US2013/078071
                                                48
delivery device 100 prior to use. In such embodiments, the sensor and/or switch 126 can be
operable to detect the removal the adapter 120 from the medicament delivery device 100 and can
cause the adapter 120 to send a signal (e.g., to the monitor device 150) via the radio 122 and/or
to emit an audible output via the audible output device 124. In some embodiments, as described
herein, the adapter 120 can adjust a communication mode, a communication interval, and/or a
power level associated with a wireless communication between the adapter 120 and the monitor
device 150. In this manner, the adapter 120 can be configured to conserve power resources when
the medicament delivery device 100 is coupled to and/or disposed within the adapter (i.e., the
medicament delivery device 100 is otherwise not armed for and/or likely to be used).
[1167]      In some embodiments, the adapter 120 can include an electronic circuit system,
similar to the electronic circuit system 4900 shown and described above, to contain, include
and/or provide interconnection between the components discussed herein (e.g., the radio 122, the
audible output device 124 and the sensor 126). For example, in some embodiments, the adapter
 120 can include an electronic circuit system having one or more switches of the type disclosed
above with reference to the electronic circuit system 4900.
[1168]      Although described as producing an audible output, in other embodiments, any of the
devices and/or systems described herein can produce a human perceivable signal, such as
audible, visual, vibratory and/or haptic alerts. In other embodiments, the signal can be a radio
signal, IR signal and/or signals otherwise not human perceivable. An embodiment can include
both human perceivable and signals that are not human perceivable.           For example, in some
embodiments, the removal of the medicament delivery device 100 from the adapter 120 can
place a power source (not shown) of the medicament delivery device 100 in electrical
communication with an electrical circuit. When "powered on," the medicament delivery device
can produce a signature pressure wave output (either audible or inaudible) that is detected by
microphone on the adapter. As described in more detail herein, in response to the receipt of this
signal, the adapter 120 can adjust a characteristic of the wireless communications therefrom.
The medicament delivery device 100 can further be configured to produce a second pressure
wave (e.g., an audible output) to provide instructions to the user, as described above.

    WO 2014/106096                                                          PCT/US2013/078071
                                                49
[1169]      The monitor device 150 can include a radio 152, an audible output device 154, and/or
one or more sensors 156, and can be operable to monitor the user via the sensor 156,
communicate with the adapter 120, and/or provide an audible output. The monitor device 150
need not include all of the components shown in FIG. 35 nor perform all of the functions
described herein. For example, in some embodiments, a locator according to an embodiment can
be devoid of a sensor 156.       The monitor device 150 can be operable to be easily located,
identified and/or readily accessible by the user and/or third parties. For example, the monitor
device 150 can be a bracelet, a necklace, a keychain fob, a watch, a ring, an adhesive patch, a
cellular phone or other personal electronic device, and/or any other suitable object. The monitor
device 150 can be a piece of jewelry and/or integrated into a piece of jewelry.           In some
embodiments, however, the monitor device 150 can be inconspicuous, so as to not draw attention
to the user. For example, in some embodiments, the monitor device 150 can be similar to and/or
incorporated within an article that is inconspicuous.    For example, in some embodiments, the
monitor device 150 can be located on an inner layer of clothing, incorporated or manufactured as
a part of the clothing, incorporated into a common accessory, fabricated to resemble a standard
key fob, or the like. In other embodiments, the monitor device 150 can be conspicuous such that,
in the event of a medical emergency, bystanders can readily identify and/or locate the monitor
device 150, which can, in turn, allow the bystander to identify and/or locate the medicament
delivery device 100. In yet other embodiments the monitor device 150 can be configured to
transition between an inconspicuous configuration and a conspicuous configuration.       Similarly,
stated, in some embodiments the monitor device 150 can be inconspicuous in a standby state,
e.g., when there is no medical emergency, and conspicuous in an active state, e.g., when there is
a medical emergency, and/or when activated by the user. For example, the monitor device 150
can emit an alert, such as an alarm or recorded instruction via the speaker 154 and/or can have
flashing lights, vibration (haptic output) and/or any other suitable mechanism to draw attention
when the monitor device 150 is in the active (or conspicuous) state. Similarly stated, the monitor
device 150 can include any suitable mechanism for changing between a first configuration and a
second configuration in response to an event (e.g., a medical emergency, a notification received
from a doctor, pharmacy or the like).
[1170]      In some embodiments, the monitor device 150 can be a computing device similar to
the computing device 1510 described above. In such embodiments the computing device (e.g., a

    WO 2014/106096                                                            PCT/US2013/078071
                                                50
smart phone) can be adapted to perform the functions of the monitor device 150 as described
herein. For example, a cellular telephone can execute an application operable to monitor the user
via the sensor 156, communicate with the adapter 120, and/or provide an audible output via the
audible output device 154.
[1171]       The monitor device 150 can communicate with the adapter 120 via the radio 152.
The communication between the monitor device 150 and the adapter 120 can be initiated by any
suitable method, including manual initiation and/or automatic initiation. In some embodiments,
the communication between the monitor device 150 and the adapter 120 can be initiated by
pushing a button. In other embodiments, the monitor device 150 can be activated by a signal
from the sensor 156 and/or the sensor 126. In this manner, for example, the communication can
be initiated when the sensor 156 detects a significant change in the user's vital signs. In some
embodiments, the monitor device 150 and the adapter 120 can establish and maintain a
substantially continuous and/or periodically verified communications link. If the link is severed,
e.g., the monitor device 150 moves out of communications range from the adapter 120, the
monitor device 150 and/or the adapter 120 can emit a signal, such as an audible or visual alarm,
to alert the user to the broken connection. Such an embodiment could reduce the likelihood of
the user forgetting to carry the adapter 120 and/or the monitor device 150 together.
[1172]       In some embodiments, as described herein, characteristics of the communication
between the monitor device 150 and the adapter 120 can be modified in response to a signal
received from the sensor 156, the sensor 126, a manual entry or the like.
[1173]       In use, the monitor device 150 and the adapter 120, can cooperatively function to aid
the user in identifying and/or locating the adapter 120, which can, in turn, aid the user in locating
the medicament delivery device 100. For example, when actuated the monitor device 150 can
send a signal, e.g., via the radio 152, to the adapter 120 to cause the adapter 120 and/or the
medicament delivery device 100 to emit a human-perceivable signal, such as an audible or visual
alert. The human perceivable signal can be operable to draw the user's attention to the adapter
 120.
[1174]       In some embodiments, the monitor device 150 and/or the adapter 120 can be operable
to calculate and/or report a distance between and/or a direction of the locator relative to the

    WO 2014/106096                                                              PCT/US2013/078071
                                                  51
adapter 120. For example, the adapter 120 and/or the monitor device 150 can be operable to
calculate their respective positions (e.g., absolute positions or position relative to each other), for
example based on the strength and/or direction of a radio signal, triangulation, trilateration, GPS,
or any other suitable means. In such embodiments, the monitor device 150 can direct the user to
the location of the adapter 120 based on the calculation of the relative positions.               This
arrangement can allow, for example, the monitor device 150 and/or the adapter 120 to produce a
dynamic alert based on the change in position of the monitor device 150 and the adapter 120.
For example, in some embodiments, the adapter 120 can emit a pulsed audible output when
communication with the monitor device 150 is established. Based on the calculated relative
position and/or distance between the adapter 120 and the monitor device 150, an intensity,
frequency and/or magnitude of the audible output can change. In particular, the frequency and/or
magnitude of the audible output (e.g., a beep) can get higher and/or louder as the monitor device
 150 is moved closer to the adapter 120 (and/or the medicament delivery device 100). In this
manner the adapter 120 and/or the monitor device 150 can include and/or operate as a proximity
detector.
[1175]      In some instances, a person requiring administration of a medicament, "a patient,"
may not be the person administering the delivery of the medicament (referred to herein as "a
user"). For example, the medicament contained in the medicament delivery device 100 may be
intended for administration in a medical emergency, during which the patient may be
incapacitated. For example, in some embodiments, the medicament delivery device (e.g., the
medicament delivery device described above with reference to FIGS. 3-34) may be intended to
deliver epinephrine in the event of an anaphylactic crisis, or to deliver naloxone in the event of
an opioid overdose, or any other potentially life-saving medication. In such an emergency, the
patient may not be able to operate the medicament delivery device 100.                Accordingly, as
described herein, in such circumstances, the monitor 150 can detect the presence of a medical
condition (e.g., via sensor 156), can produce an instruction, alert or other notification (e.g., via
the audible output device 154), and can either prompt the third party care giver to initiate
communication with the adapter 120 or automatically establish such communications.                 For
example, in some embodiments the sensor 156 can be operable to detect physiological
parameters associated with the patient, such as heart rate/pulse, respiratory rate, blood sugar,
blood oxygen, blood or tissue lactate level, blood or tissue ketone level, an immune response,

    WO 2014/106096                                                               PCT/US2013/078071
                                                  52
acceleration (e.g., associated with a fall), brain activity, and/or the like. In the event the monitor
device 150 detects an abnormal condition that may require medical attention, the monitor device
 150 can emit a signal to be received by the adapter 120, such that the adapter can provide an
indication, instruction or the like as discussed herein.
[1176]      In some embodiments, the monitor device 150 and any of the monitoring devices,
adapters and/or locators described herein can be configured to send a wireless signal in response
to the detection of an abnormal condition or potential emergency.              In particular, in some
embodiments, the monitor device           150 and/or any device operably coupled thereto can
automatically dial an emergency number such as, for example, 911 (emergency dispatcher),
and/or send information associated with the location of the device and/or the end user location
through GPS satellite positioning or network based positioning (using cell phone towers). In this
manner, the adapter 120, the monitor device 150 and an remote device (not shown in FIG. 35)
can form a network, as described above with reference to FIG. 1.
[1177]      In other embodiments, the monitor device 150 can be triggered by a non-emergency
event.   For example, in some embodiments, the sensor 156 can be configured to measure
environmental conditions or the like (e.g., temperature, humidity, presence of certain allergens,
etc.) and establish communications with the adapter 120 based on such measurements.                For
example, in some embodiments, the medicament delivery device 100 can be an inhaler, and the
monitor device 150 can measure and analyze environmental data such that the monitor device
 150 can alert the patient and/or user to use the inhaler.
[1178]      Although the monitor device 150 is shown as including a sensor 156, in other
embodiments, the monitor device 150 need not include any sensors.               For example, in some
embodiments, the monitor device 150 be conspicuous and/or include a conspicuous label such
that a third party will recognize the monitor device 150, and can then manually initiate
communication with the adapter 120 (e.g., by pressing a switch, similar to actuating a "page"
feature). For example, in some embodiments, the monitor device 150 can include a conspicuous
start button that, when pushed, results in a message being produced by the monitor device 150.
The message can state, for example, "THE PERSON WEARING THIS IDENTIFIER IS
CARRYING AN AUTO-INJECTOR TO TREAT SYMPTOMS RELATED TO . . . IF THIS

    WO 2014/106096                                                           PCT/US2013/078071

PERSON IS EXHIBITING SUCH SYMPTOMS, PLEASE LOCATE THE AUTO-INJECTOR,
WHICH IS NOW BEEPING, AND FOLLOW THE NEXT SET OF INSTRUCTIONS."
[1179]      Although the adapter 120 is shown as being a separate component that is coupled to a
medicament delivery device 100 (e.g., such a sleeve, and adapter, or the like), in other
embodiments, the functionality of the adapter 120 can be incorporated into the medicament
delivery device 100, such that the monitor device 150 communicates and/or interacts directly
with the medicament delivery device 100 to perform the functions described herein.
[1180]      Although shown as interacting with a single medicament delivery device 100, in other
embodiments, an adapter 120 can interact with more than one medicament delivery device 100.
In other embodiments, a monitor device 150 can interact with more than one adapter 120 and/or
medicament delivery device 100. For example, FIG. 36 shows a medicament delivery system
including a locator 250, a first adapter 220A that can be operable to interact with a medicament
delivery device 200 and a second adapter 220B that can be operable to interact with a
medicament container 260. The locator 250 can include a radio 252, an audible output device
254, and/or one or more sensors 256, and can be operable communicate with the adapter 220A
and the adapter 220B, and/or provide an audible output, in a similar manner as described above
with reference to the monitor device 150, and as described below.
[1181]      In particular, the locator 250 can communicate with the adapter 220A to confirm the
existence of, identify and/or locate the medicament delivery device 200, as described above with
reference to the monitor device 150 and adapter 120. Thus, the adapter 220A can include any of
the structure and components, and can function similar to any of the adapters described herein.
In this manner, in the event of a medical condition involving the medicament in the medicament
container 260 (e.g., an overdose), the adapter 220A can assist the user (or patient) in locating the
medicament delivery device 200. In addition, because the locator 250 is in communication with
the adapter 220B, the locator 250 and/or the adapter 220B can, as described below, provide
compliance and/or historical information related to the use of the medicament in the medicament
container 260 (e.g., how many pills were recently removed from the container), as well as
instructions and/or assistance in identifying and/or locating the medicament delivery device 200.

    WO 2014/106096                                                           PCT/US2013/078071
                                                  54
[1182]      The adapter 220B includes a sensor 226 to monitor location, use history, fill level
and/or any other suitable parameter associated with the medicament container 260 and/or the
medicament delivery device 200. In this manner, when the locator 250 is activated (e.g., by a
user), the locator and the adapter 220B can provide information to the user regarding the status
of the medicament. In addition to assisting in the location of the medicament delivery device
200, providing such information can be important in determining the appropriate course of
action. For example, in some embodiments, the adapter 220B can be operably coupled to the
medicament container 260, and the sensor 226 can be operable to determine, measure, record,
and/or otherwise monitor the contents and/or the use of the medicament container 260. In some
embodiments, the sensor 226 can measure the weight, volume, quantity, and/or any other
appropriate parameter of the medicament within the medicament container 260. The sensor 226
can be an optical sensor configured to align with a window of the medicament container 260 to
measure color, fill level, turbidity, and/or any other suitable parameter. In some embodiments,
the sensor 226 can detect when the cap of the medicament container 260 is removed, when the
medicament is administered, the amount of medicament in the medicament container 260,
withdrawal of medicament from the medicament container 260, and/or changes in the volume
and/or mass of the contents of the medicament container 260. In this manner, the adapter 220A
can provide the user, an emergency first responder, and/or any other person information
regarding the contents and/or usage history of the medicament container 260.
[1183]      In one example, the medicament container 260 includes a pain medication, such as
opioids. In the event of a serious opioid toxicity or overdose emergency, information regarding
the identity and usage history of the opioids may be relevant to the treatment of the patient. If
the patient has recently received a large dose of opioids, it may be necessary to treat the patient
for an overdose, for example by administering an opioid antagonist.            By monitoring the
medicament container 260, the adapter 220B (either alone or in conjunction with the locator 250)
can alert a user (e.g., a third party) if treatment is needed. The adapter 220B can cooperatively
function with the locator 250, the medicament delivery device 200 (and/or the adapter 220A or
sleeve of the device) to produce a signal and/or indication identifying and/or locating the
medicament delivery device. In particular, the adapter 220A, the adapter 220B and/or the locator
250 can produce and signals and/or provide any indications in a similar manner as the adapter
 120 and/or the monitor device 150 described above. For example, the adapter 220A and/or the

    WO 2014/106096                                                            PCT/US2013/078071
                                                55
locator 250 can also instruct the user to use the medicament delivery device 200, which can
include the opioid antagonist.
[1184]       In another example, the medicament delivery device 200 and/or the medicament
container 260 can include a dose of vaccine, such as a hepatitis B or HPV vaccine to be
administered within a certain time period. The sensor 226 of the adapter 220B can be operable
to monitor the storage time and/or temperature of the medicament delivery device 200 and/or the
medicament container 260 to improve the likelihood that an efficacious dose of medicament is
delivered. If the medicament delivery device 200 and/or the medicament container 260 is not
used within a predetermined time period, the adapter 220B can alert the user and/or a care-giver,
such as a prescribing doctor, healthcare provider, or insurance company that the medicament has
not yet been delivered. For example, the adapter 220B can emit an audible and/or visual alert,
e.g., via the audible output device 224. In addition or alternatively, the adapter 220B can send an
electronic signal via the radio 222 operable to alert the user and/or healthcare provider (either
directly to a remote device, such as a smart phone, or via the locator 250).
[1185]       In some embodiments, the adapter 220B and/or the adapter 220A can be operable to
receive a signal via the radio 222 (although the radio 222 is not shown as being included within
the adapter 220A, it is understood that the functionality of the adapter 220A can be the same as
or similar to the functionality of the adapter 220B). In some embodiments, for example, the
healthcare provider can remotely query the adapter 220 regarding the status and/or use history of
the medicament delivery device 200 and/or medicament container 260.                In this way, the
healthcare provider can determine whether the medicament delivery device 200 and/or the
medicament container 260 has been used within the predetermined time period and/or can
schedule follow-up contact and/or care based on the use of the medicament delivery device 200
and/or the medicament container 260.
[1186]       In some embodiments, the locator 250 and/or the adapter 220B can be included
within and/or can be a portion of a container within which the medicament container 260 is
disposed (e.g., for storage, shipping or the like).     For example, in some embodiments the
medicament container 260 can be disposed within the adapter 220B, such that the sensor 226
and/or the other components of the adapter 220B are operably coupled to the medicament

    WO 2014/106096                                                           PCT/US2013/078071
                                               56
container 260.    In other embodiments, the adapter 220B can be coupled to and/or can be a
portion of the medicament container 260. For example, the adapter 220B can be a cap of the
medicament container 260, an insert for the medicament container 260, a dispenser for the
medicament container 260, a sleeve, a case, and/or label of the medicament container 260.
[1187]      In some embodiments, the system can include the adapter 220B that is coupled to the
medicament container 260 external to the housing or medicament contained therein.              For
example in some embodiments the adapter 220B can be a sleeve and/or label of the medicament
container 260. In other embodiments, the system can include an adapter 220B that is coupled
within the medicament container 260. For example, in some embodiments, the adapter 220B can
be included within a desiccant package contained within the medicament container 260, on an
interior surface of the medicament container 260. Similarly, the adapter 220A can be coupled to,
included within and/or can be a portion of the medicament delivery device 200. For example, in
some embodiments, the adapter 220A can be a mouth piece that is removably coupled to an
inhaler. In other embodiments, the adapter 220A can be a cover that is removably coupled to a
nasal delivery system
[1188]      Although not shown in FIG. 36, the adapter 220A can include any of the functionality
of the adapter 220B described above. For example, the adapter 220A can include a sensor and/or
a switch to determine a parameter associated with of operation of the medicament delivery
device 200. For example, in some embodiments, the adapter 220A can be coupled to an inhaler
(or other multi-dose device), and can track the patient's compliance in using the device. In this
manner, the adapter 220A and/or the adapter 220B can function, either independently, in
conjunction with each other and/or in conjunction with the locator 250 as "smart sleeves" to
improve the efficacy of the dosages contained in either the medicament container 260 or the
medicament delivery device 200.
[11891       Although described, at least in part, as relating to an emergency situation, the
systems and methods described herein can be easily extended to non-emergency situations. For
example, in a chronic-care setting a patient can purchase an initial kit that includes the adapters
220A and 220B, and one or more locators 250 configured to communicate with the adapters, as
described herein. The user can removably couple the adapter 220B to the medicament container

    WO 2014/106096                                                             PCT/US2013/078071
                                                 57
260 and/or the adapter 220A to the medicament delivery device 200, such that upon refilling the
medication, the appropriate adapter can be coupled to the replacement medicament container 260
and/or medicament delivery device 200.
[1190]      Although the medicament container 260 and the medicament delivery device 200 are
described above as being separate (although related in application), in some embodiments, the
medicament container 260 can be disposed within the medicament delivery device 200. For
example, the medicament container 260 can be a vial of medicament disposed within and
delivered by an auto injector, inhaler, and/or other suitable medicament delivery device 260. In
another embodiment, the medicament container 260 can be operable to refill and/or replenish the
medicament delivery device 200.        For example, the medicament container 260 can transfer
medicament to the medicament delivery device 200 or, although only one medicament container
260 is shown, in some embodiments, a kit can multiple medicament containers 260 (refills). In
other embodiments, the medicament container 260 can be used in conjunction with and/or
independently from the medicament delivery device 200.              For example, the medicament
container 260 can include medicament related to, but not administered via the medicament
delivery device 200. For example, the medicament container 260 can include opioids and the
medicament delivery 200 device can be operable to deliver an opioid antagonist, such as
naloxone, naltrexone or the like, in the event of a severe opioid toxicity or overdose event.
[1191]      Although the adapter 220A and the adapter 220B are shown as communicating
through the locator 250, the devices shown and described herein can communicate in a peer-to
peer fashion.
[1192]      FIG. 37 is a front view of a cover 14240 (also referred to as an adapter, sheath or
sleeve) for a medicament delivery device (not shown). The cover 14240 includes an electronic
circuit system having a processor 14246, a radio 14243, and a speaker 14248.               In some
embodiments, the processor 14246, the radio 1424314243, and the speaker 14248 can all be
disposed on a single printed circuit board. In some embodiments, the cover 14240 can include a
battery, such as a coin-cell battery operable to power the processor 14246, the radio 1424314243,
and the speaker 14248. The batteries can be, for example, lithium coin cells model CR1613, CR
2032 or the like. The cover 14240 can be an adapter configured to be coupled to a medicament

    WO 2014/106096                                                          PCT/US2013/078071
                                                 58
delivery device, and can perform the functions of the adapter 1210 and/or the sleeve 4200
described above (or any combination of the functions thereof). For example, the cover 14240
can define a cavity 14242 operable to receive the medicament delivery device. In some
embodiments, the medicament delivery device (not shown) can include its own electronic circuit
system, similar to the circuit system 4900 shown and described above.             In some such
embodiments, the cover 14240 and the medicament delivery device can each have separate
power sources.
[1193]       The processor 14246 can be any suitable processor.       For example, the processor
 14246 can be structurally and/or functionally similar to the processor 1216 as shown and
described above with reference to FIG. 1. For example, the processor 14242 can be a Bluetooth*
Low Energy processor (e.g., of the type shown in FIG. 2) configured to operate the radio
 1424314243 to communicatively couple the cover 14240 to a computing device. In addition or
alternatively the processor 14246 can be operable to perform speech processing and/or operate
the speaker 14248, for example to generate an audible output, such as a speech output (of the
types and in response to the inputs as described herein). Similarly stated, a processor having a
single die can be suitable to operate the radio 1424314243 and the speaker 14248.
[1194]       Although not shown in FIG. 37, in some embodiments, the adapter 12240 can include
any of the modules described herein. For example, in some embodiments, the adapter 12240 can
include any of a communication module, a use module and/or a leash module as described above
with respect to FIG. 1. Thus, the processor 14246 can execute code to modify one or more
characteristics of the wireless communication between the radio 14243 and a computing device
(e.g., a cell phone, not shown) to manage the power usage of the cover 14240. For example, in
some embodiments, the processor 14246 can execute code to change the communication mode
between the cover 14240 (i.e., the "slave" device) and a computing device (i.e., the "master"
device) as a function of the status of the medicament delivery device.
[1195]       Moreover, in some embodiments power management techniques, such as time
multiplexing can be executed by the processor 14246. Such power management methods can be
performed, for example, by a power module (not shown in FIG. 37). For example, the processor
 14246 can be operable to manage power draw such that high-draw and/or processor intensive

    WO 2014/106096                                                         PCT/US2013/078071
                                                59
operations, such as voice processing and operating the radio 14243 are not executed
simultaneously.    For example, in some embodiments, a method can include delaying and/or
extending a communication interval during a time period when operations involving a recorded
speech output via the speaker 14248 and/or a light output device (not shown) are performed. In
other embodiments, a method can include changing a communication mode during a time period
when operations involving a recorded speech output via the speaker 14248 and/or a light output
device (not shown) are performed. For example, in some embodiments, a method can include
transitioning the device to a sniff or park mode upon activation of the device to conserve power
draw from the instruction features of the device.
[1196]      As shown and described with reference to FIGS. 1, 35 and 36, in some embodiments,
the cover 14240 can include a switch and/or a sensor operable to detect, for example, when the
medicament delivery device is removed from the cover 14240 and/or when medicament delivery
device is actuated. In some embodiments, the processor 14246 can be operable to cause the
speaker 14248 to generate an audible output, such as a tone or natural speech output in response
to the cover 14242 being removed from the medicament delivery device, in response to a signal
received via the radio 14243, and/or in response to a sensor detecting the actuation of the
medicament delivery device. In addition or alternatively, the processor 14246 can be operable
transmit a signal via the radio 14243 (e.g., to a computing device, not shown) in response to the
cover 14240 being removed from the medicament delivery device and/or in response to a sensor
detecting the actuation of the medicament delivery device. In some embodiment, the processor
 14246 can be operable to alter a communication interval and/or communication mode (e.g., from
connectable to connected, from sniff to active, and/or from a relatively longer communication
interval to a relatively shorter communication interval) in response to the cover 14240 being
removed from the medicament delivery device and/or a sensor detecting the actuation of the
medicament delivery device.      In this manner, the cover 14240 can conserve the power for
situations in which wireless communications with the remote computing device is most likely.
[1197]      In some embodiments, the cover 14240 can also interact with and/or influence the
operation of an electronic circuit system of the medicament delivery device contained therein
(e.g., medicament injector 4000). For example, as shown and described herein, for example with
reference to FIGS. 7, 9, and 25, the cover 14240 can include a battery isolation tab. The battery

    WO 2014/106096                                                              PCT/US2013/078071
                                                  60
isolation tab can be configured to isolate a power source (such as a battery) from an electronic
circuit of the medicament delivery device when the medicament delivery device is disposed
within the cover 14240. Although shown and described with respect to FIG. 25 as isolating the
battery from the entire electronic circuit system, in some embodiments, the battery isolation tab
can be operable to isolate a only a portion of a circuit while another portion of the circuit remains
electrically coupled to the power source. For example, a "leaky" or "hi draw" portion of the
circuit (i.e., a portion of the circuit having a relatively high power draw during idle) can be
isolated from the battery, while a less leaky or essential portion of the circuit can remain
powered. As one example, a portion of a circuit including a communication module, such as a
Bluetooth* module, can be continuously powered, while a portion of a circuit including an audio
processor and/or speaker can be isolated. In some embodiments, such a battery isolation tab can
be a multi-stage battery isolation tab, such that, for example, if the battery isolation tab is in a
first position the battery is completely isolated from the circuit, if the battery isolation tab is in a
second position, a portion of the circuit is isolated while another portion of the circuit is
electrically coupled to the power source, and if the battery isolation tab is in a third position, the
full circuit is electrically coupled to the power source.
[1198]        FIG. 38 is a signal diagram illustrating a series of communications that can be
initiated and/or received by any of the devices and system described herein.                The signal
communications are operable to increase the likelihood that a patient 3152 receives appropriate
medical care in the event of a medical emergency and/or during a dosing regimen. In the event
that the patient 3152 requires treatment and needs assistance and/or is not able to operate a
medicament delivery device 3100 configured to provide the needed treatment, it may be
necessary to alert a third-party bystander or emergency first responder (a user 3102).               As
described herein, the alert can include a notification of the presence of the medicament delivery
device 3100 and/or provide the user 3102 instructions for the use of the medicament delivery
device 3100. As shown in FIG. 38, a system includes a monitoring device 3150, a adapter 3120
and/or a communication device 3122 that cooperatively aid the patient 3152 and/or the user 3102
in identifying the medical emergency, locating the medicament delivery device 3100,
administering the needed treatment, and/or reporting the medical emergency. Although FIG. 38
shows each of the monitoring device 3150, the adapter 3120, the medicament delivery device
3100 and/or the communication device 3122, in some embodiments certain functions attributed

    WO 2014/106096                                                           PCT/US2013/078071
                                                61
to one of these devices can be performed by any other of these devices. Moreover, a system and
method according to an embodiment need not include each of these devices.
[1199]       Each of the monitoring device 3150, the adapter 3120, the medicament delivery
device 3100 and/or the communication device 3122 can be operable to send and/or receive
signals. The signals can be human perceivable, such as audible, visual, vibratory and/or haptic
alerts.  In other embodiments, the signals can be electromagnetic signals, radio signals, IR
signals and/or signals otherwise not human perceivable.        An embodiment can include both
human perceivable and signals that are not human perceivable.
[1200]      As shown by the signal 3210, the monitoring device 3150 is operably coupled to the
patient 3152 and can send and/or receive the signal 3210. More particularly, the monitoring
device 3150 is operable to sense when the patient 3152 requires the administration of a
medicament, e.g., from the medicament delivery device 3100, and can produce the signal 3210 in
response thereto. The monitoring device 3150 can be, for example, a sensor operable to detect
physiological parameters associated with the patient 3152, such as heart rate/pulse, respiratory
rate, blood sugar, blood oxygen, an immune response, acceleration (e.g., associated with a fall),
brain activity, and/or the like. In some embodiments, the monitoring device 3150 can be similar
to the monitor device 150 and/or the locator 250 described above, or any of the other locators
described below. For example, in some embodiments, the monitoring device can be integrated
with and/or coupled to a piece of jewelry (e.g., a ring, watch, belt buckle, or necklace) worn by
the user, or the like.
[1201]       In the event the monitoring device 3150 detects a condition that may require medical
attention, the monitoring device 3150 can emit the signal 3220 operable to alert the patient 3150
and/or the signal 3220 to alert the user 3102 to the abnormal condition. Signals 3220 and/or
3230 can be an audible and/or visual alert, such as an alarm, a strobing light, and/or a recorded
instruction. If the patient 3152 is capable of responding the condition (e.g., the patient 3152 is
not incapacitated) the patient 3152 can silence the alarm and/or administer the necessary
treatment (e.g., using the medicament delivery device 3100). If, however, the patient 3152 is
incapable of responding to the condition (e.g., the patient 3152 is incapacitated), the signal 3230
can notify the user 3102 that the patient 3152 requires medical attention, that the medicament

    WO 2014/106096                                                           PCT/US2013/078071
                                                62
delivery device 3100 is present, provide instructions for using the medicament delivery device
3100, and/or instructions for obtaining further information related to the medicament delivery
device 3100.
[1202]       In addition to producing the signals 3220 and 3230, the monitoring device 3150 can
produce the signal 3240 to communicate with an adapter 3120, which can be coupled to or
integral with the medicament delivery device 3100.       The adapter 3120 can be similar to the
locator devices 120 and/or 220 shown and described above. In some embodiments, the adapter
3120 can be incorporated into a sleeve within which at least a portion of the medicament delivery
device 3100 is disposed (e.g. similar to the sleeve 4200 shown and described above with
reference to FIGS. 3-34).        The adapter 3120 can facilitate communication with and/or
identification of the medicament delivery device 3100 in accordance with any of the methods
described herein.
[1203]      As described herein, the monitoring device 3150 and the adapter 3120 can cooperate
to aid the user 3102 in locating the medicament delivery device 3100. For example, signal 3240
can cause the adapter 3120 to emit an audible or visual alert operable to draw the user's 3102
attention, and/or the monitoring device can be operable to ascertain the location of the adapter
3120, e.g., via radio location techniques, and emit an output operable to guide the user to the
adapter 3120. For example, the monitoring device 3150 can emit a tone and/or chirp that varies
in pitch, frequency, and/or volume as the distance between the monitoring device 3150 and the
adapter 3120 changes. In this way, the adapter 3120 can be operable to guide the user 3102 to
the medicament delivery device 3100.
[1204]      As shown as signal 3250, the medicament delivery device 3100 can provide
instructions to the user 3102 and/or can direct the user 3102 to obtain instructions for the use of
the medicament delivery device 3100.       For example, the instruction can any of the electronic
instructions described herein, such as electronic output OP1 and/or OP2 shown and described
above with reference to the medicament delivery device 4000. In some embodiments, signal
3250 can include recorded instructions regarding the use of the medicament delivery device
3100. In some embodiments, after the medicament delivery device is located, a visual output in
the form of LCD Display output can direct the user regarding instructions for using the device.

[1205]        In some embodiments, either the patient 3152 and/or the user 3102 can possess the
communication device 3122, and the system and/or the communication device 3122 can be
adapted and/or enabled to perform all or portions of the functions of the monitoring device 3150,
the adapter 3120 and/or the medicament delivery device 3100. In this manner, the system and
methods can utilize the communication resources that are commonly available. In particular, in
some embodiments, the communication device 3122 can be a smart phone or other portable
electronic device (pager, game system, music system or the like). In such embodiments, the
systems described herein can be configured to employ the communication resources (e.g., the
speakers, display capabilities, signal processing, transmission / reception capabilities, or the like)
of the communication device 3122 to enhance the performance of the overall system.
[1206]        For example, in some embodiments, the medicament delivery device 3100, the
monitoring device 3150 and/or the adapter 3120 can include a label having a machine-readable
code. The machine-readable code can be, for example, a bar code, a QR codeTM and/or an
address of a website. During an event, the user can scan or otherwise read the machine-readable
code using the communication device 3122 (e.g., a cellular phone) to access instructions. For
example, in some embodiments, upon scanning the machine-readable code, the user's cellular
phone will be directed to a website or other location in which instructions for using the
medicament delivery device 3100 and/or otherwise treating the patient are provided. In other
embodiments, the label can include a text message prompting the user to scan the machine
readable code with the patient's communication device 3122. In a similar manner, the patient's
communication device can be directed to a website or other location in which instructions for
using the medicament delivery device 3100 and/or otherwise treating the patient are provided
3122. Moreover, the patient's communication device 3122 can include information unique to the
patient, such as, for example, a listing of contacts to reach in the event of an emergency (in some
embodiments, by scanning the machine-readable code, a text message will automatically be sent
to this list), an application stored locally that provides detailed instructions unique to the patient
or the like.
[1207]        In other embodiments, the communication device 3122 can enable the user 3102 to
access the patient's 3152 medical history, provide patient specific instructions, and/or prompt the
user 3102 to notify emergency personnel and/or the patient's 3152 emergency contact.               For

    WO 2014/106096                                                            PCT/US2013/078071
                                                 64
example, in some embodiments, upon detection of an event, the patient's communication device
3122 can emit a ring tone prompting the user 3102 to access the communication device 3122.
Upon accessing the patient's communication device 3122, the user 3102 can receive signals
and/or information related to the patient's medical history or the like.
[1208]      In other embodiments, the communication device 3122 (e.g., either the user's mobile
computing device or the patient's mobile computing device) can be configured to receive a
signal (not shown) from the medicament delivery device 3100 and/or the adapter 3120. The
signal can be received, for example, after the communication device 3122 is used to scan a label,
tag or other machine-readable code on the medicament delivery device 3100 and/or the adapter
3120. In other embodiments, the signal can be received automatically (e.g., without the need to
scan a code), for example, in response to the manipulation of the medicament delivery device
3100. Upon receiving the signal, the communication device 3122 can then transmit visual and
audible instructions for using the medicament delivery device 3100. In some embodiments, for
example, the medicament delivery device 3100 and/or the adapter 3120 can include an electronic
circuit system similar to the electronic circuit system 4900 shown and described above, except
that instead of producing an output via LED's (e.g., LED 4958A and 4958B) and/or an audible
output device (e.g., device 4956), the electronic circuit system produces a wireless signal in
response to actuation of the switches therein (e.g., switches 4926 and 4946).              In some
embodiments, the wireless signal can be received by the communication device 3122 (e.g., either
the user's mobile computing device or the patient's mobile computing device).                    The
communication device 3122 can then, in turn, produce the audible and visual instructions in
response to manipulation of the medicament delivery device 3100. This arrangement allows the
computing and/or communication resources of the communication device 3120 to be used to
enhance the instructions, locating capabilities and/or the like of the systems described herein.
[1209]      Although FIG. 38 is shown and described as having a separate monitoring device
3150 and adapter 3120, in some embodiments, some or all of the functions of the monitoring
device 3150 and the adapter 3120 can be combined in a single device. For example, as shown in
FIG 39, a system can include and/or employ a cellular phone 6122 operable to communicate with
the medical delivery device 6100 (e.g., via Bluetooth*). The cellular phone 6122 can also be
configured to communicate with the patient 6152 and/or the user 6102 (e.g., via audio or visual

    WO 2014/106096                                                             PCT/US2013/078071
                                                 65
outputs), and the medicament delivery device 6100 (e.g., via Bluetooth*) to aid the patient 6152
and/or the user 6102 in identifying, locating and/or using the medicament delivery device 6100.
The medicament delivery device 6100 can be similar to the medicament delivery devices shown
and described above. The locator device 6120 can be similar to the locator devices shown and
described above, and/or can be integrated into the medicament delivery device or cover (e.g., the
sleeve 4200).
[1210]      For example, the functions of the monitoring devices described above can
incorporated into the patient's cell phone 6122 (as indicated by the inclusion of the monitoring
device 6150).     For example, the monitoring device 6150 can be operable to sense when the
patient 6152 requires the administration of a medicament. As described above with reference to
FIG. 38, the monitoring device 6150 can be operably coupled to monitor the patient 6152, as
shown by the arrow 6210. The monitoring device 6150 can comprise sensors incorporated into
and/or operatively coupled to the cell phone 6122, such as accelerometers, gyroscopes, and/or
peripheral devices, such as heart rate monitors. Upon detecting a condition, the patient's 6152
cell phone can alert the patient 6152 (via signal 6220) and/or the user 6102 (via signal 6230).
For example, in some embodiments, the cell phone 6122, can emit an audible, visual, and/or
haptic signal to draw the attention of the patient (e.g., signal 6220) and/or the user (signal 6230).
Signals 6220 and/or 6230 can instruct the patient 6152 and/or the user 6102, respectively, that
the patient 6152 requires medical attention.
[1211]      In some embodiments, the system can include one or more sensors external to the cell
phone 6122, but which are coupled to the cell phone, either wireless or via a wired connection.
For example, in some embodiments the patient 6152 may wear a monitoring device, such a
glucose meter, a heart rate monitor or the like. Although such external devices may produce an
audible alarm, the systems and methods described herein allow the patient's cell phone 6122 to
act as a central "hub" to receive such signals, produce an enhanced output, communicate with the
medicament delivery device 6100 or the like.
[1212]      The cell phone 6122 can also be operable to display e.g., via a visual output device, or
emit, e.g., via an audible output device, information and/or instructions regarding the patient's
medical history and/or the administration of medicament using the medicament delivery device

    WO 2014/106096                                                             PCT/US2013/078071
                                                 66
6100. The cell phone 6122 can also automatically contact emergency personnel and/or prompt
the patient 6152 and/or the user 6102 to contact emergency personnel.
[1213]      For example, in some embodiments, the cell phone 6122 (either the patient's cell
phone or the user's cell phone) can execute an application (e.g., in hardware) that can unlock
and/or otherwise configure the cell phone 6122 to be used by the patient 6152 and/or the user
6102. In some embodiments, the cell phone 6122 can automatically display a prompt and/or
instruction upon detecting a specified condition. Thus, the cell phone 6122 can be configured to
be useable and/or provide information to the user 6102 in the event of a medical emergency
without requiring a password or unlock sequence. For example, in some embodiments, the touch
screen of the cell phone 6122 can display a button in response to the detection of a specified
condition that prompts a user (e.g., a third party) to enter the application. In other embodiments,
the cell phone 6122 can display a message prompting the user to "swipe," scan or read a
particular code thereby unlocking the cell phone for subsequent use as described herein. For
example, in some embodiments, the user can be prompted to swipe, scan or read an identification
card, another device, a medicament container or the like.
[1214]      The cell phone 6122 can aid the user 6102 in administering medicament to the patient
6152 using the medicament delivery device 6100. For example, the cell phone 6122 can send a
signal 6240 to the medicament delivery device 6100 to aid the user 6102 in locating the
medicament delivery device 6100. The cell phone 6122 can provide instructions to assist the user
6102 in administering a medicament to the patient 6152 via the medicament delivery device
6100. In addition, the cell phone 6122 can also send a signal to administer the medicament
without the user interfacing with the medicament delivery device 6100.
[1215]      Although the locators (e.g., monitor device 150) are shown and described above as
being "wearable" items, such as a key fob, jewelry or the like, in other embodiments a locator
can be a substantially stationary item. Moreover, although the locators (e.g., monitor device
 150) are shown and described above as being unique to a particular patient, in other
embodiments, a locator can be used to track multiple different patients, users or care-givers
and/or to communicate with multiple different devices (either different devices of the same type
or different devices of different types).      Such a locator can be used, for example, in an

    WO 2014/106096                                                            PCT/US2013/078071
                                                 67
institutional setting (schools, nursing homes, hospitals or the like) or in a public access setting
(restaurants, airports, health clubs or the like) to improve the ability of patients and user to
identify, locate and/or actuate a variety of different medicament delivery devices. Moreover, in
some embodiments, a locator can, in addition to performing the identification and/or location
features described herein, serve to prevent unauthorized and/or undesired access to medicaments.
For example, FIGS. 40-42 depict a kit (or container) 300 according to an embodiment. The kit
300 includes a medicament container 360 containing any suitable medicament. The kit 300 can
be intended for home and/or institutional use and can be wall-mounted and/or otherwise
substantially fixed in a particular location. The kit 300 can store and/or dispense a medicament
(e.g., from within the medicament container). In some embodiments, the kit 300 can dispense an
opioid and/or provide access control for an opioid or other controlled substance.
[1216]      The kit 300 also includes a movable portion 318, such as, for example, a hinged lid,
that has a first position (see FIG. 40) and a second position (see FIGS. 41-42). When the
movable portion 318 is in the first position, the movable portion 318 covers an internal region
312 defined the kit 300. Conversely, when the movable portion 318 is in the second position, at
least a portion of the internal region 312 of the kit 300 is exposed. Said another way, when the
movable portion 318 is in the second position, the medicament container 360 can be removed
from the internal region 312 of the kit 300.
[1217]      The container or kit 300 includes an electronic circuit system 322 that is operatively
coupled to and/or includes a radio 324, a first switch 336, and a second switch 337. The switches
can be operably coupled to any suitable mechanism. In particular, the first switch 336 is coupled
to a lock mechanism (not shown) that, when in the locked configuration, will prevent the
movable portion 318 from being moved into the opened position. The electronic circuit system
322 is includes an actuator or other mechanism configured to cause the first switch 336 to move
between a first state (e.g., closed) and a second state (e.g., opened) when the radio 342 receives a
signal from an access control device 310 and/or the electronic circuit system 322 validates the
signal. When the first switch 336 is in its second state (e.g., opened) the locking mechanism is
"unlocked" such that the movable portion 318 can be moved between its first position and its
second position, as indicated by arrow E in FIG. 41. In this manner, the patient or user can only

    WO 2014/106096                                                          PCT/US2013/078071
                                                68
access the medicament container when the access control device 310 is present and is
manipulated to send the access signal.
[1218]      The access control device 310 can be, for example an RFID device. The electronic
circuit system 322 can log information associated with the access control device 310, such as a
unique identifier (e.g., when the kit 300 is configured to be accessed by more than one user each
having a unique access control device 310), time of access, number of access attempts, time
between access attempts, etc. In some embodiments, the electronic circuit system 322 can be
configured to only allow access to the contents of the kit 300 (e.g., only move the first switch
336 from the first state to the second state) at certain times, after certain intervals, and/or to
certain individuals. The radio 324 can transmit a signal associated with usage history to, e.g., a
remote monitoring device (such as a computer), and/or receive and respond to a query regarding
usage history.
[1219]      As an example, the medicament container 360 can include a controlled substance
and/or a medicament with potentially dangerous side effects, such as an opioid.               This
arrangement limits access to the medicament container 360 the identity of the user (e.g., via the
access control device 310), based on time, past usage, and/or quantity. In some embodiments,
access to the medicament container 360 can also be limited to patients having a medicament
delivery device (e.g., an auto-injector) containing an opioid antagonist.     In this manner, the
system ensures access to the opioid only when there exists the likelihood that rapid treatment
will be available in the event of an overdose (i.e., via the presence of the medicament delivery
device in close proximity to a user, patient or care-giver).        In such an embodiment, the
medicament delivery device containing the opioid antagonist can be or include the access control
device 310. The medicament delivery device can include, for example, an RFID chip detectable
by the radio 324. When the patient presents the medicament delivery device (the access control
device 310), the electronic circuit system can identify the user and determine whether to grant
access to the medicament.
[1220]      The second switch 337 is configured to move between a first state (e.g., closed) and a
second state (e.g., opened) when the medicament container 360 is removed from the internal
region 312 of the kit 300, as indicated by the arrow F in FIG. 42. The electronic circuit system

                                                 69
330 can be configured to log the removal of the medicament container 360 in response to the
changing state of the switch. The electronic circuit system can associate the removal of the
medicament container 360 with a user identifier provided by the access control device 310. In
some embodiments, second switch 337 can be operable to determine the quantity of medicament
removed from the interior region 312 of the kit.
[1221]      In some embodiments, the electronic circuit system 330 can be configured to cause
the radio 324 to transmit a signal associated with the removal of the medicament container 360
from the interior region 312 of the kit 300. For example, in some embodiments, the kit 300 can
communicate with a computer (not shown) to log medicament usage and/or send notifications
(e.g., notify medical providers, notify emergency personnel, notify pre-programmed contact
personnel, etc.).
[1222]      In some embodiments, the electronic circuit system 330 can be configured to output
an audible and/or visual output, for example via a speaker and/or an LCD screen when the
second switch 337 is moved from its first state to its second state, for example, a recorded speech
output and/or a video output associated with an identification of the medicament container 360,
an identification of patient symptoms (e.g., instructions for assessing the physical condition of
the patient) and/or an instruction for using the medicament. For example, in some embodiments
the output can be an audio-visual output via both a speaker and an LCD screen step-by-step
instructions for using the medicament.
[1223]      Although the movable member 318 is shown and described as being a hinged lid, in
some embodiments, the movable member can be coupled to the container in any suitable fashion.
For example, in some embodiments, the movable member 318 can be a removable cover that is
slidingly coupled to the container. In other embodiments, the movable member 318 can be a
removable cover that is threadedly coupled to the container (i.e., a removable cap). In yet other
embodiments, the movable member 318 can be a removable cover that is coupled to the
container via an interference fit. In yet other embodiments, the movable member 318 can be a
frangible cover that is irreversibly removed from the container during use of the medical device.
For example, in some embodiments the movable member 318 can be a frangible cover that
provides a tamperproof seal, a sanitary seal, or the like.

    WO 2014/106096                                                          PCT/US2013/078071

[1224]      Although the containers, kits and/or adapters are shown and described in some
instances above as being rigid, box-like containers, in other embodiments, a container, kit and/or
adapter can have any suitable shape and/or flexibility. For example, in some embodiments, a
container, kit and/or adapter can be a flexible, pouch-like container. Such a container, kit and/or
adapter can be more easily carried in certain circumstances, such as, for example at outdoor
events (e.g., children's camps, concerts, picnics or the like). In other embodiments, a container,
kit and/or adapter can be a tube or sheath (e.g., similar to the cover 4200 described above)
configured to contain all or a portion of a medicament delivery device 360.
[1225]      Although FIGS. 40-42 depict and describe a medicament container 360 removable
from the interior region 312 of the container or kit 300, in other embodiments, the kit 300 can be
operable to dispense medicament without a container 360. For example, the kit 300 can be
operable to dispense medicament tablets, pills, capsules, liquid, aerosols, and/or any other
suitable medicament form. In such embodiments, the movable member 318 can be a dispensing
mechanism configured to meter a quantity of medicament. For example, the moveable member
318 and/or the second switch 337 can be operable to count and dispense an appropriate number
of pills. The moveable member 318 and/or the second switch 337 can also include a loss-in
weight meter, a volumetric pump, and/or any other suitable mechanism for dispensing, metering,
and/or measuring the removal of medicament and/or medicament container(s) 360 from the
interior region 312.
[1226]      In some embodiments, the medicament container 360 can be a medicament delivery
device and/or the medicament container 360 can be disposed within a medicament delivery
device.    In such an embodiment, the medicament delivery device can be similar to the
medicament delivery device 4000 shown and described above.
[1227]      FIG. 43 depicts a schematic illustration of a medicament delivery device 11002
operable to be coupled to a case or cover 11197. The medicament delivery device 11002 can be
similar to the medicament delivery devices shown and described above, such as medicament
delivery device 4000. The case 11197 can be a case operable to be physically and/or electrically
coupled to the medicament delivery device 11002 and a communication device 11990 (e.g., a
cell phone). The case 11197 can be a sleeve (such as the cover 4200 described above), a flexible

    WO 2014/106096                                                          PCT/US2013/078071
                                                71
pouch or the like. The case 11197 includes an electronic circuit system 11920. The electronic
circuit system 11920 can be any electronic circuit system of the type shown and described
herein. For example, the cover 11197 can be structurally and/or functionally similar to the cover
 14240 shown and described above with reference to FIG 37. For example, the electronic circuit
system 11920 can be configured to monitor the status of the medicament delivery device 11002,
interact with (or be actuated by) to produce a signal, actuate the medicament delivery device
 11002, provide instructions for using the medicament delivery device 11002 or the like.
[1228]       In some embodiments, the medicament delivery device 11002 can include a safety
guard that is moved prior to administering the medicament and an actuator that is moved to
initiate delivery of the medicament. The safety guard can be similar to safety lock 4700 shown
and described above. The actuator can be similar to the base 4300 shown and described above.
In some embodiments, the medicament delivery device 11002 and/or the case 11197 can detect
that the medicament delivery device 11002 is ready for use and send a signal to the
communication device 11990.        In response, the communication device 11990 (e.g., the cell
phone) can provide instructions to the patient and/or user regarding the use of the medicament
delivery device 11002. For example, in some embodiments, movement of the safety guard (to
place the medicament delivery device 11002 in a "ready" configuration) can trigger the
electronic circuit system 11920, causing the case 11197 to "detect" the status of the medicament
delivery device 11002.      The case 11197 can then send a signal that is received by the
communication device 11990 such that an application running on the communication device
 11990 provides instructions. In some embodiments, the communication device 11990 can be
operable to send a signal, such as an alert to a pre-programmed emergency contact via the
communication network 11999.
[1229]       In some embodiments, the case 11197 can include sensors and/or can receive signals
from the medicament delivery device 11002.         In this manner, the case 11197 can transmit
information associated with the use of the medicament delivery device 11002 to the
communication device 11990. The communication device 11990 can provide instructions to the
patient and/or user based on the status and/or a change in configuration of the medicament
delivery device 11002. For example, the communication device 11990 can provide different
instructions associated with the removal of a safety guard, positioning the medicament delivery

device 11002 and/or case 11197 against a body part, and/or triggering the medicament delivery
device 11002 (e.g., movement of an actuator or base).
[1230]      In some such embodiments, the communication device 11990, the case 11197, and
the medicament delivery device 11002 can be communicatively coupled such that the status
and/or use of the medicament delivery device 11002 can be remotely monitored. For example,
the case 11197 can be operable to report the status of the medicament delivery device 11002 to a
remote server via the communication device 11990 and the communication network 11999.
[1231]      In some embodiments, a case or cover can be configured to removably contain at last
a portion a medicament delivery device and a communication device (e.g., a cell phone). In this
manner, the case can operably couple a medicament delivery device to an off-the-shelf
communication device to produce a "smart" medicament delivery device. For example, FIGS.
44 and 45 are schematic diagrams of a case 21197 coupled to a medicament delivery device
21990 and a cell phone 21002.        The medicament delivery device can be similar to the
medicament delivery device 4000 as shown and described above or any other suitable device.
The case 21197 can define a first volume operable to contain the medicament delivery device
21990 and a second volume operable to contain a cell phone 21002. Thus, the case 21197 can
couple the medicament delivery device 21990 to the cell phone 21992, thereby increasing the
likelihood that the medicament delivery device 21990 is available in the event that a medicament
is needed.
[1232]      The case 21197 contains an electronic circuit 21920. The electronic circuit system
21920 can be operable to store, process and/or produce electronic signals associated with the use
of the medicament delivery device 21990. The electronic system 21920 can be similar to any of
the electronic circuit systems shown and described herein.      Moreover, the electronic system
21920 is communicatively coupled to the cell phone 21002. The electronic system 21920 can be
communicatively coupled to the cell phone 21002 via any suitable mechanism, such as, for
example via a wired configuration (via the docking port, USB port, or other port on the cell
phone 21002), via a physical connection (e.g., via a member, switch actuator or the like that
transmits input to the cell phone 21002 via the touch screen or other buttons on the cell phone
21002) or wirelessly via an RF or optical signal. In some embodiments, the electronic circuit

    WO 2014/106096                                                         PCT/US2013/078071
                                                73
system 21920 can provide an input to the cell phone 21002 via a microphone of the cell phone
21002.    For example, in some embodiments, manipulation of the case 21197 and/or the
medicament delivery device 21990 disposed therein (as described below) can result in the
electronic circuit system 21920 producing a pressure wave (either audible or inaudible) having a
particular frequency or pattern of frequencies that is detectable by the microphone.      In this
manner, the electronic circuit system 21920 can trigger the cell phone to send a signal, run an
application, or the like, based on the status and/or change in configuration of the medicament
delivery device 21990.
[12331       In some embodiments, the electronic circuit system 21920 can be operably coupled
to the medicament delivery device 21990. In some embodiments, the case 21197 and/or the
electronic circuit system 21920 can be physically, but not electronically coupled to the
medicament delivery device 21990. In such an embodiment, the case 21197 can be operable to
monitor the status of (e.g., to receive input from) the medicament delivery device via physical
changes and/or forces applied by or to the medicament delivery device 21990, as described in
more detail herein.
[1234]      The medicament delivery device 21990 includes a safety tab 21995 and an actuator
21997. The safety tab 21195 and the actuator 21997 can be, for example, similar to the safety
lock 4700 and the base 4300, respectively, shown and described above. As shown, in FIG. 44, a
portion of the safety tab 21995 is disposed outside of the case 21997 prior to use of the
medicament delivery device 21990.       In this manner, although the medicament deliver device
21990 is disposed within and/or is covered by the case 21977, the user can prepare the
medicament delivery device 21990 for actuation by accessing the exposed portion of the safety
tab 21995. The safety tab 21995 can be removed before using the medicament delivery device
21990 as indicated by arrow G in FIG. 44. Moreover, removing the safety tab 21995 can cause
the medicament delivery device 21990 to change position (i.e., to a "ready position") within the
case 21197.    In this manner, a delivery member (e.g., a needle) of the medicament delivery
device 21990 can be moved in proximity to the opening through which the safety tab 21995 was
disposed, thereby preparing the device to deliver the medicament therein.

    WO 2014/106096                                                           PCT/US2013/078071
                                                74
[1235]       When the safety tab 21995 is removed, the medicament delivery device 21990 can be
secured in the ready position by a movable retaining portion 21924 of the case 21197. The
retaining portion 21924 can be a spring-actuated tab, a deformable portion of the case 21197 or
the like that, upon movement of the proximal edge of the medicament delivery device 21990, is
released to limit movement of the medicament delivery device 21990.              Additionally, the
electronic circuit 21920 can sense that the retaining portion 21924 has secured the medicament
delivery device 21990 in the ready position and can send a signal to the communication device
21002. In response, the cell phone 21002 can provide an instruction to the user and/or send a
signal to a remote monitoring device, e.g., via a network, an emergency dispatch system (911
call) or the like. For example, the cell phone 21002 can instruct the user to place the case 21197
against the thigh and/or send a notification, such as an SMS message to a pre-programmed
emergency contact.
[1236]       The electronic circuit 21920 can sense that the retaining portion 21924 has secured
the medicament delivery device 21990 via any suitable mechanism, such as, for example, a
switch that is actuated upon movement and/or removal of the safety tab 21995, movement of the
housing of the medicament delivery device 21990 or release and/or movement of the retaining
portion 21924.
[1237]       In some embodiments, the case 21197 can include a sensor 21992 (see FIG. 45)
operable to detect if the case 21197 and the medicament delivery device 21990 are positioned
against the body of the user. Accordingly, the electronic circuit system 21920 can send a signal
to the communication device 21002 when the sensor 21922 detects that the case is properly
positioned. In response, the communication device 21002 can provide an instruction to the user
and/or send a signal to a remote monitoring device. For example, the communication device
21002 can instruct the user to actuate the medicament delivery device and/or send a notification,
such as an SMS message to a pre-programmed emergency contact.
[1238]       With the medicament delivery device 21990 in the ready position, as indicated in
FIG. 45, the actuator 21997 is exposed and/or is disposed at least partially outside of the case
21997. In this manner, the medicament delivery device 21990 can be actuated by moving an
actuator 21997, as indicated by arrow H. Actuating the medicament delivery device 21990 can

    WO 2014/106096                                                           PCT/US2013/078071
                                                75
cause it to deliver a medicament (e.g., as described above with reference to the device 4000).
The electronic circuit system 21924 can detect that the medicament delivery device 21990 has
been actuated, for example, by detecting a force associated with actuation against the retaining
portion 21924, and can provide an instruction to the user and/or send a signal to a remote
monitoring device. For example, the communication device 21002 can instruct the user to seek
medical attention, and/or send a notification, such as an SMS message to a pre-programmed
emergency contact. In other embodiments, a portion of the actuator 21997 can actuate and/or
contact a switch of the electronic circuit system 21920 such that a signal is sent to the cell phone
21002.
[1239]      In this manner, the electronic circuit system 21920 can send electronic signals
associated with the status, use, and/or other function of the medicament delivery device to and/or
receive electronic signals from a communications network via the cell phone 21002.
[1240]      FIG. 46 is a flow chart of a method pairing an adapter with a computing device. The
adapter (which can be coupled to and/or configured to be coupled to a medicament delivery
device and/or a simulated device) and the computing device can be structurally and/or
functionally similar to the adapter 1210 and/or the computing device 1510, as shown and
described above with reference to FIG. 1, or any other adapters and devices shown and described
herein. At 22010, the computing device can establish a communication link according a wireless
protocol, such as a Bluetooth* link, with the adapter. In some embodiments, the communication
link (or pairing of devices) can be maintained indefinitely (e.g., as long as the adapter and the
computing device are within range and both devices are powered). In other embodiments, the
communication link (or pairing of devices) can time out after a pre-determined time period, for
example, if there is no data associated with the status and/or use of a medicament delivery device
within the time-period, which may be 1 hour, 1 day, 2 days, and/or any other suitable time
period.
[1241]      In some instances, maintaining an active link can be more energy efficient than
repeatedly linking with the adapter. In such an instance it may be desirable to maintain the link.
In some embodiments, the link can be maintained, but the computing device can instruct the
adapter to enter a sniff or park mode or other suitable mode to conserve power.

    WO 2014/106096                                                          PCT/US2013/078071
                                              76
[1242]      At 22020, a signal associated with a use of and/or change in configuration of the
medicament delivery device can be received from a sensor. For example, the adapter can include
a switch operable to detect when the medicament delivery device is removed from the adapter
and/or when the medicament delivery device is armed (e.g., when a safety tab is removed). In
other embodiments, the adapter can include an optical sensor to detect a change in status of the
medicament delivery device (e.g., to detect a change in the opacity and/or color of the
medicament, to detect removal from the adapter or the like).     In yet other embodiments, the
adapter can include a microphone to detect a sound pressure wave associated with a change in
the configuration and/or status of the medicament delivery device.      Such a change in sound
pressure wave can be produced by a mechanical feature (e.g., a signature "snap" sound when the
medicament delivery device is removed) or electronically (e.g., via a series of tones produced by
the medicament delivery device when it is powered up).
[1243]      In response, the computing device and/or the adapter can modify a parameter
associated with the communication link, at 22030.      For example, in some embodiments, a
communication mode can be altered (e.g., from a sniff mode in effect prior to receiving the
signal to an active mode). In other embodiments, an advertising interval can be altered, and/or a
communication interval can be altered.       For example, it may be desirable to decrease a
communication interval (e.g., the time between successive signals, portions of a signal and/or
data packet transfers) when the medicament delivery device is readied for use to increase
communication bandwidth and/or decrease the latency of the connection. In this way, more data
and/or more timely data can be transferred between the adapter and the paired computing device
during the delivery of a medicament.
[1244]      Optionally, at 22040 the computing device can receive an indication that the
medicament delivery device was actuated.       For example, the adapter can include a sensor
operable to detect the actuation of the medicament delivery device (which can be the same or a
different sensor as discussed above). When the adapter senses the actuation, it can send a signal
to the computing device, which can be received, at 22040.          In response to receiving the
indication of the actuation, the computing device and/or the adapter can optionally produce an
audible output, at 22050. For example, the computing device output a verbal instruction that a
medicament has been delivered, instruction to contact a doctor and/or emergency response,

    WO 2014/106096                                                            PCT/US2013/078071
                                                 77
instructions for follow-up care, and so forth. In addition or alternatively, the computing device
can be operable to send a signal to a remote device (e.g. similar to the remote device 1610 as
shown and described with reference to FIG. 1) reporting the actuation of the medicament
delivery device. Furthermore, in an embodiment where the computing device is a mobile phone,
the computing device can be operable to initiate a telephone call, for example, to 911, an
emergency contact, a doctor, etc.
[1245]      FIG. 47 is a flow chart illustrating a leash method that can be implemented by any of
the leash modules shown and described herein. At 22110, a computing device (which can be
similar to the computing device 1510) can establish a communication link, such as a Bluetooth@
link, with the an adapter (which can be similar to the adapter 1210), a medicament delivery
device and/or a simulated medicament delivery device. Once a link is established, the computing
device can check, record, and/or report its location (e.g., via GPS), at 22120.
[1246]      The communication link can be maintained while the computing device and the
adapter are within radio range. At 21130, the computing device can receive an indication at a
first time that the connection has been lost. The indication can include a failure to receive an
acknowledgement of a signal sent to the adapter device, the failure of the adapter device to send
a data packet at an expected time, and/or any other suitable indication. In some instances, the
indication of failure can be associated with radio interference, in other instances, the failure can
be associated with a user carrying the computing device away from the adapter (or vice versa).
[1247]      In embodiments where the adapter is coupled to or configured to be coupled to a
medicament delivery device, it may be medically advisable that the medicament delivery device
be available to the user at all times. If a medicament delivery device is rarely used, however, the
user may have a tendency to forget to carry the medicament delivery device with him or her.
The user may be much less likely to forget to carry a mobile phone (e.g., computing device).
Thus if the computing device losses contact with the adapter, it may be an indication that the user
has forgotten the medicament delivery device.        The computing device can verify its location
(e.g., via GPS), at 22140.      If the location of the computing device is similar to the location
received at 22120 (e.g., within a predetermined distance), this can indicate that the user is still
near the adapter. Similarly, checking the location, at 22140 can include determining whether the

    WO 2014/106096                                                           PCT/US2013/078071
                                                 78
computing device is located in a "home" region (e.g., a predetermined boundary or geographic
area), which can indicate that the user is still near the adapter. The home region can be a
predefined region, e.g., selected by the user. For example, the computing device can be operable
to prompt or allow the user to define a home region, which can be an area where the user is
likely to have access to a medicament delivery device (e.g., the user's house) and/or the
computing device can be operable to infer a home region, for example, based on a common
location of the computing device and/or a common location of a computing device during a
particular period (e.g., the user can infer that a location of the computing device at 3:00 am is a
home region).
[1248]      If, the location of the computing device at 22140 is different from the location at
22120 (e.g., by 300 feet, 1000 feet, 1/2 mile, 5 miles, and/or any other suitable distance), and/or
the location of the computing device at 22150 is outside the home region, this can indicate that
the medicament delivery device has been left behind, and an alert can be generated, at 22150.
The alert can include an audible and/or visual alert to inform the user that connection has been
lost. In addition or alternatively, the computing device can send a signal e.g., via WiFi or a
cellular data network to a remote device, such that user compliance can be tracked and/or
monitored.
[1249]      FIG. 48 is a flow chart of a method of operation of a simulated medicament delivery
device, according to an embodiment. A simulated medicament delivery device (also referred to
herein as a "trainer") can be used to train a user on the operation of an actual medicament
delivery device. A simulated delivery device can be structurally and/or functionally similar to
any of the medicament delivery devices described herein, but may be devoid of a medicament a,
needle, and/or components associated with delivery of the medicament.                 A simulated
medicament delivery device can include a processor, memory, a battery, sensors and/or any other
suitable components.     In some embodiments a simulated medicament device can be resettable
and/or reusable.    A simulated medicament delivery device can be coupleable to an adapter,
and/or can include any of the components of the adapters shown and described herein. For
example, a simulated medicament device can include a Bluetooth@ processor and can be
operable to communicatively link with a computing device, as described herein.

    WO 2014/106096                                                           PCT/US2013/078071
                                                 79
[1250]       At 22160, an indication associated with a first operation of a simulated medicament
delivery device can be received.       For example, a simulated medicament delivery device can
include one or more sensors and/or switches operable to detect various operations, such as sensor
operable to detect when a sleeve is removed, when a safety guard is removed, when an actuator
is manipulated, the position of the simulated medicament delivery device, and/or any other
suitable operation. The indication received, at 22160 can be any suitable operation associated
with the use of a simulated medicament delivery device.
[1251]       In response to receiving the indication, at 22160, an first audible output can be
generated, at 22170. The audible output can be associated with a first script, and can be an
acknowledgement of the operation, an instruction of a next operation, an instruction that an
operation was not properly performed (e.g., operations performed out of sequence, operations
performed with insufficient force, operations performed with the simulated medicament delivery
device in an improper orientation, an instruction that the operation was not performed within an
appropriate period of time, etc.), and so forth.
[1252]       At 22180, information associated with the operation can be stored, for example in a
memory (e.g., a memory coupled to the simulated medicament delivery device, a memory of an
adapter, a memory in a remote database, etc.) The information stored, at 22180, can include an
indication of which operation was performed, time data, orientation data, temperature data,
and/or any other suitable information.       The information stored, can be used to improve the
training of the user. For example, the information stored can reveal a pattern of improper use.
At 22190, a second script can be produced. The second script can, for example, reflect updated
instructions based on errors identified from the information.
[1253]       At 22195, a second audible output associated with the second script can optionally be
generated. The second audible output can be based on information stored, at 22180, and/or the
second operation. In this way, the second audible output can be based on patterns (e.g., the first
operation and the second operation), elapsed time, and/or any other suitable characteristic. As an
illustration, if the first operation and the second operation are each attempted manipulations of
the actuator, the indication received at 22160, and the indication received, at 22190, are each
indications that insufficient force was applied, the second script, and the second audible output,

                                                80
at 22195 can include an instruction that to apply additional force, as insufficient force has twice
been applied.
[1254]      FIG. 49-51 are screenshots of instances of a user interface for an application.       A
processor, for example, a processor of a computing device such as a mobile phone
communicatively linked to an adapter and/or medicament delivery device, can execute the
application. The application can provide a user information associated with status, location, use,
etc.
[1255]      For example, as shown in FIG. 49, in some instances, the application can provide
access to a trainer simulator, a demo video, written instructions, reminders and notifications,
and/or a medicament delivery device monitor.       For example, the instance of the application
shown in FIG. 49 can enable a user to access a demonstration video. Such a video can aid a user
in properly using a medicament delivery device.       Similarly, written instructions, can provide
convenient access to detailed information associated with a medicament delivery device.          In
some cases, owing to the size of a medicament delivery device, labeling real estate may be at a
premium. An application can provide additional information, as well as interactive information,
such as hyperlinks etc. The written instructions can also be updated remotely.
[1256]      In addition, the application can be operable to provide reminders, for example, if the
user is scheduled to use the medicament delivery device. In embodiments where the computing
device is communicatively linked to the adapter, the application can receive signals from the
adapter associated with use of the medicament delivery device. In this way, a reminder may only
be issued if the user has not actually used the medicament delivery device according to a
schedule.
[1257]      The application can also generate alerts, for example if the medicament has expired,
been recalled, or if the medicament delivery device has experienced a temperature unsuitable for
the medicament. Any suitable methods for tracking the temperature history of the medicament
delivery device can be employed, such as, for example, those methods disclosed in U.S. Patent
No. 8,361,029, entitled "Devices, Systems and Methods for Medicament Delivery" issued
January 29, 2013, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
Similarly stated, a computing device can receive signals associated with the status of the

    WO 2014/106096                                                           PCT/US2013/078071
                                                81
medicament delivery device from the medicament delivery device and/or from a remote
computing device and the application can notify the user of the status.
[1258]      In some embodiments, the application can notify the user if the medicament delivery
device is out of range, for example, generating an alert as shown in FIG. 50. As shown and
described above with reference to FIG. 47, a lost communication link can be indicative that a
user has forgotten to carry the medicament delivery device.             Similarly stated, in some
embodiments a computing device, such as a mobile phone, can execute the method (e.g., at a
processor) shown and described with reference to FIG. 47.           In such an embodiment, an
application can alert the user of the lost communication link.
[1259]      FIG. 51 depicts an instance of an application operable to monitor a medicament
delivery device. The application can be personalized, as represented by a depiction of an avatar
22210 or photo of the user. The application can indicate a connection status 22220, for example
indicating the presence and/or strength of a communication link.         The application can also
display, for example based on information received from an adapter, information associated with
the charge state 222230 of a battery associated with the adapter and/or medicament delivery
device and/or the current temperature 22240 of the medicament delivery device and/or
temperature history of the medicament delivery device (which may be relevant to medicament
stability). Furthermore, the application can enable the user to send a signal to the adapter to
cause the adapter to emit a sound 22250, which may aid the user in locating the medicament
delivery device and/or can cause the computing device to use radio-location techniques to aid the
user in locating the adapter 22260.
[1260]      Some embodiments described herein relate to a computer storage product with a non
transitory computer-readable medium (also can be referred to as a non-transitory processor
readable medium) having instructions or computer code thereon for performing various
computer-implemented operations.          The computer-readable medium (or processor-readable
medium) is non-transitory in the sense that it does not include transitory propagating signals per
se (e.g., a propagating electromagnetic wave carrying information on a transmission medium
such as space or a cable). The media and computer code (also can be referred to as code) may be
those designed and constructed for the specific purpose or purposes. Examples of non-transitory

                                                82
computer-readable media include, but are not limited to: magnetic storage media such as hard
disks, floppy disks, and magnetic tape; optical storage media such as Compact Disc/Digital
Video Discs (CD/DVDs), Compact Disc-Read Only Memories (CD-ROMs), and holographic
devices; magneto-optical storage media such as optical disks; carrier wave signal processing
modules; and hardware devices that are specially configured to store and execute program code,
such as Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs), Programmable Logic Devices (PLDs),
Read-Only Memory (ROM) and Random-Access Memory (RAM) devices.
[1261]       Examples of computer code include, but are not limited to, micro-code or micro
instructions, machine instructions, such as produced by a compiler, code used to produce a web
service, and files containing higher-level instructions that are executed by a computer using an
interpreter.  For example, embodiments may be implemented using imperative programming
languages (e.g., C, Fortran, etc.), functional programming languages (Haskell, Erlang, etc.),
logical programming languages (e.g., Prolog), object-oriented programming languages (e.g.,
Java, C++, etc.) or other suitable programming languages and/or development tools. Additional
examples of computer code include, but are not limited to, control signals, encrypted code, and
compressed code
[1262]       While various embodiments of the invention have been described above, it should be
understood that they have been presented by way of example only, and not limitation. Where
methods described above indicate certain events occurring in certain order, the ordering of
certain events may be modified.        Additionally, certain of the events may be performed
concurrently in a parallel process when possible, as well as performed sequentially as described
above.
[1263]       For example, although electronic circuit systems are shown and described above as
outputting one or more outputs directed towards a single, immediate user, in some embodiments,
a locator device and/or monitoring device can output multiple outputs directed towards multiple
different classes of users.    For example, in some embodiments, the locator device and/or
monitoring device can output a first output to the immediate user and second output to a
remotely located emergency response team. In such embodiments, the second output can be, for
example, a phone call, SMS, a page, an e-mail or the like. For example, in some embodiments,

    WO 2014/106096                                                            PCT/US2013/078071
                                                 83
the second output can be an e-mail to the parents and/or care-givers of a child. Moreover, such a
second output can be transmitted either wirelessly or through a wired network.
[1264]       Although the electronic circuit systems are shown and described above as outputting
one or more outputs in response to one or more switches, in other embodiments an electronic
circuit system can output an electronic output in response to any number of different inputs. For
example, in some embodiments, an electronic circuit system can output an electronic output
based on input from the user provided via a keyboard, a touch screen, a microphone or any other
suitable input device. In this manner, the electronic outputs can be produced in response to
direct feedback from the user.
[1265]       The adapters, medicament delivery devices and simulated medicament delivery
devices are described herein as being configured to produce one or more wireless signals in
accordance with the methods described herein.           Although the methods and apparatus are
described herein as being configured to modify the communication mode and/or the
communication interval associated with such wireless signals in response to a change in the
status and/or configuration of a device (e.g., a medicament delivery device or a simulated
medicament delivery device), in other embodiments, any of the apparatus and methods described
herein can modify any aspect of the wireless signals based on such change in status and/or
configuration. For example, in some embodiments a method can include modifying a power
level of a wireless signal in response to a change in status and/or configuration of a medicament
delivery device or a simulated medicament delivery device. In other embodiments, a method can
include modifying the information contained within a wireless signal in response to a change in
status and/or configuration of a medicament delivery device or a simulated medicament delivery
device. For example, in some embodiments, a wireless signal can include information associated
with a signal power level (e.g., TX Power) and/or an identification of a device. Such information
can be changed in response to a change in status and/or configuration of a medicament delivery
device or a simulated medicament delivery device.
[1266]       In some embodiments, information included within a signal can include instructions
to initiate a natural language user interface associated with (or running on) another device. Thus,
any of the apparatus and methods described herein can be configured to send and/or can include

    WO 2014/106096                                                           PCT/US2013/078071
                                                84
the sending of a signal to initiate a natural language user interface associated with a remote
computing device. For example, in some embodiments, the adapter 120 can be configured to
send a wireless signal to initiate a natural language user interface associated with the monitor
device 150. In such embodiments, the monitor device 150 can be, for example, a smart phone
having a natural language user interface, such as, for example, Siri (from Apple) or any other
"intelligent personal assistant." The adapter can be configured to initiate the user interface via
the wireless connection by sending a signal. In some embodiments, the signal can be sent in
response to a change in the status and/or configuration of the medicament delivery device and/or
the simulated medicament delivery device.        In this manner, the adapter 120 can initiate the
interface to provide the user with additional resources during a time of activity with the
medicament delivery device and/or the simulated medicament delivery device. Moreover, in
such embodiments, the adapter 120 can also be configured to relay input to the user interface via
the wireless connection between the adapter 120 and the monitor device 150. For example, in
some embodiments, a user can input information via a microphone on the adapter 120 to send
information to the user interface of the monitor device 150.
[1267]      In some embodiments, a computing device can send signals based on and/or produced
from a natural language interface that are received by a medicament delivery device, an adapter
and/or a simulator of the types shown and described herein. For example, a system can include a
computing device, such as a cell phone that has a natural language interface, and a medicament
delivery device, such as a patch pump.         In such embodiments, a user can provide voice
commands to natural language interface of the cell phone.        Such commands can include, for
example, instructions to administer an additional dose, instructions to call a health-care
professional or the like. In response, the cell phone can send, via a wireless connection of the
types shown and described herein, a signal to the medicament delivery device. The device can
then execute the instructions. In this manner, the capability of the cell phone can be leveraged to
produce a voice-activated medicament delivery device.
[1268]      Although the embodiments of FIGS. 40-42 are shown and described as receiving a
signal from an access control device 310, in other embodiments, a user could enter a password
PIN or other personally identifiable information to the kit 300 via a keyboard, touch screen,
voice command and/or any other suitable device.

    WO 2014/106096                                                           PCT/US2013/078071
                                                85
[1269]      Although the kit 300 of FIGS. 40-42 is shown and described as containing a
removable medicament container 360, in other embodiments, the kit 300 can dispense a
medicament directly, and/or can dispense a medicament delivery device.
[1270]      Although the adapters 120 and 14240 are shown and described above a receiving at
least a portion of a medicament delivery device (or simulated medicament delivery device), any
of the adapters described herein can be coupled to a medicament delivery device (or simulated
medicament delivery device) in any suitable manner. For example, in some embodiments, any
of the adapters described herein can be coupled to a medicament delivery device (or simulated
device) via only one side (i.e., the adapter does not "receive" a portion of the device).       For
example, in other embodiments, any of the adapters described herein can be similar to the
container shown and described with respect to the kit 300. In yet other embodiments, the adapter
can be a wall-mounted box within which multiple medicament delivery devices, medicament
containers and/or simulated medicament delivery devices can be stored.
[1271]      Some embodiments described above include an adapter (or medicament delivery
device) and a locator device operable to communicate with each other and/or locate each other.
The monitoring device and/or the locator device can communicate via Bluetooth", WiFi, a
cellular telephone network, a satellite pager network, localized AM or FM radio signals,
Broadcast AM, FM, or satellite radio, RFID signals, human audible or inaudible sound waves,
IR, ZigbeeTM, X1O, and/or any other suitable signal.       In some embodiments, the monitoring
device and/or the locator device can be operable to locate any other device via, audible, visual,
radio, GPS, and/or any other suitable location technique.       The monitoring device and or the
locator device can aid a user in locating a medicament delivery device by, for example, causing
the medicament delivery device and/or the locator device to emit a audible, visual, and/or tactile
alert.  The alert can vary in power, frequency, and/or any other suitable parameter as the
monitoring device and/or the locator device are brought closer to the medicament delivery
device.
[1272]      Any of the radios, transmitters, receivers, and/or transceivers described herein can be
operable to transmit, receive, repeat, and/or otherwise interact with electromagnetic signals.
Electromagnetic signals can be of any suitable frequency. For example, the radios, transmitters,

    WO 2014/106096                                                           PCT/US2013/078071
                                                86
receivers, and transceivers can be operable to transmit and/or receive IEEE 802.11 signals,
Bluetooth* signals, FM radio signals, AM radio signals, cellular telephone signals, satellite pager
signals, RFID signals, GPS signals, and/or any other suitable electromagnetic signal.
[1273]      Although some of the embodiments described herein include one "master device"
(e.g., the monitoring device 150, which can be, for example, a smart phone) and one "slave
device" (e.g., the adapter 120), in other embodiments, devices and methods can include and/or
establish a piconet including any suitable number of master devices and/or slave devices. For
example, in some embodiments, a monitor device 150 can be configured to establish a piconet
with more than one adapter 120. In other embodiments, a monitor device can be configured to
establish a piconet with an adapter 120 configured to receive a first medicament delivery device,
a simulated medicament delivery device (or trainer) associated with the first medicament
delivery device (e.g., a wireless-enabled trainer of the types shown and described herein) and a
second medicament delivery device (e.g., a wireless-enabled medicament delivery device).
[1274]      In some embodiments, a medicament delivery device is shown and described as an
auto-injector. In other embodiments, the medicament delivery device can be a patch configured
to adhere to the patient. The patch can release a medicament, for example, after receiving a
signal that medical treatment is needed. The patch can receive the signal from, for example, a
monitoring device. In other embodiments, the medicament delivery device can be an injector
configured to be carried in a pocket of the patient's garments. The injector can be configured to
inject a medicament, for example, after receiving a signal that medical treatment is needed.
[1275]      In some embodiments, a locator device and/or a medicament delivery device can
include an electronic circuit system and/or a sensor and be operable to output an electronic
output.   Such a sensor can include, for example, a proximity sensor (e.g., to determine the
position of the medicament delivery device), a temperature sensor, a pressure sensor, an optical
sensor or the like. For example, in some embodiments, the container can include a temperature
sensor configured to sense the temperature of the medicament contained within the medicament
delivery device. In this manner, the electronic circuit system can output an instruction and/or a
status message when the medicament is too cold for effective delivery. For example, in some
embodiments, when the medicament is too cold for effective delivery or the delivery of a cold

    WO 2014/106096                                                           PCT/US2013/078071
                                                 87
medicament may cause unnecessary pain and discomfort (this may occur, for example, if the
container is being used in an outdoor setting or requires refrigeration prior to use), the electronic
circuit system can output a message, such as, for example, "Medicament is too cold - allow
medicament to reach room temperature before using" and can alert the user when the proper
temperature has been reached.
[1276]      Although in some embodiments the electronic circuit systems are shown and
described above as outputting a single output in response to an input (e.g., the removal of a
medicament delivery device, the change in position of a hinged lid, etc.), in other embodiments,
an electronic circuit system can output a sequence of electronic outputs in response to such an
input. In some embodiments, for example, when a medicament delivery device is removed from
a container, an electronic circuit system can output a predetermined sequence of use instructions
over a predetermined time period. For example, upon removing the medicament delivery device,
the first instruction can be an audible output indicating the type of medicament delivery device
removed. After a predetermined time period, the electronic circuit system can then output a
second instruction, which can be a visual output instructing the user in how to diagnose the
patient and/or prepare the patient for the medicament. In a similar manner, the electronic circuit
system can provide additional outputs to instruct the user in the use of the medicament delivery
device.    Moreover, in some embodiments, the electronic circuit system can output an output
instructing the user in post-use procedures, such as for example, the disposal of the medicament
delivery device, instructions for follow-up treatment or the like.
[1277]       For example, although the electronic circuit systems are shown and described above
as being configured to output primarily audible and visual outputs, in other embodiments, an
electronic circuit system can be configured to produce any suitable output. For example, in some
embodiments, an electronic circuit system can produce a haptic output, such as a vibratory output
produced by a piezo-electric actuator. In other embodiments, an electronic circuit system can
produce a thermal output, produced by a heating or cooling element.
[1278]      Although some embodiments describe a recorded message output in English, in other
embodiments, the electronic circuit system can output recorded speech in any language. In yet
other embodiments, the electronic circuit system can output recorded speech in multiple

    WO 2014/106096                                                          PCT/US2013/078071
                                                88
languages. In yet other embodiments, the user can select the language in which the recorded
speech is to be output.
[1279]      Medicament delivery devices shown and described above can be single-use medical
injectors, or any other suitable device for delivering one or more doses of a medicament into a
patient's body. For example, in some embodiments, a medicament delivery device can be a pen
injector containing multiple doses of a chronic-care medicament, such as, for example, insulin.
In such embodiments, an electronic circuit system can output instructions associated with not
only an initial use of the medicament delivery device, but also associated with repeated uses,
dosage monitoring or the like. In other embodiments, a medicament delivery device can include
a transdermal medicament delivery device, a wearable injector or pump that dispenses drug over
several hours or days, an inhaler or a nasal medicament delivery device.
[1280]      Any of the monitoring devices, adapters and/or locators described herein can be
configured to send a signal in response to the detection of a potential emergency. For example,
in some embodiments any of the devices described herein can be GPS-enabled, and can
automatically dial an emergency number such as, for example, 911 (emergency dispatcher),
and/or send information associated with the location of the device and/or the end user location
through GPS satellite positioning or network based positioning (using cell phone towers).
[1281]      Although various embodiments have been described as having particular features
and/or combinations of components, other embodiments are possible having a combination of
any features and/or components from any of embodiments where appropriate. For example, in
some embodiments a kit can include an electronic circuit system, two or more medicament
delivery devices and a movable portion. In such embodiments, each of the medicament delivery
devices can be associated with a switch. Moreover, the movable portion can also be associated
with a switch. In this manner, the electronic circuit system can be configured to output a first
electronic output when the movable portion is moved, a second electronic output when the first
medicament delivery device is removed from the container and a third electronic output when the
second medicament delivery device is removed from the container.
[1282]      As another example, although some embodiments are described as having a
processor, a radio, a sensor, etc. disposed on an adapter and/or a cover, devices, structures,

    WO 2014/106096                                                         PCT/US2013/078071
                                                89
and/or modules associated with adapters and/or covers can be disposed on any suitable device.
For example, in some embodiments, a housing of a medicament delivery device or simulated
medicament delivery device can include a processor and/or radio. Similarly, some embodiments
describe a kit having a processor, audible output, etc. Any devices, structures, and/or modules
associated with a kit, however, can be associated with an adapter, cover, medicament delivery
device, and/or simulated medicament delivery device.
[1283]     The medicament delivery devices described herein, such as the medicament delivery
device 100, the medicament delivery device 21990 and any others described herein, can be any
suitable medicament delivery device. For example, a medicament delivery device according to
an embodiment can include a pen injector, an auto-injector, a wearable injector or pump that
dispenses drug over several hours or days, an inhaler or a transdermal delivery device. Where
medicament delivery devices are described, it should be understood that alternative embodiments
including a simulated medicament delivery device are possible, for example, the simulated
medicament delivery devices shown and described in U.S. Patent Application No. 11/679,331
(and Patent Publication No. 2008/0059133), entitled "Medical Injector Simulation Device" filed
February 27, 2007, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. A
simulated medicament delivery device may be suitable to train a user in the operation of a
medicament device.
[1284]     The simulated medicament delivery device can simulate the actual medicament
delivery device in any number of ways. For example, in some embodiments, the simulated
medicament delivery device can have a shape corresponding to a shape of the actual medicament
delivery device, a size corresponding to a size of the actual medicament delivery device and/or a
weight corresponding to a weight of the actual medicament delivery device. Moreover, in some
embodiments, the simulated medicament delivery device can include components that
correspond to the components of the actual medicament delivery device. In this manner, the
simulated medicament delivery device can simulate the look, feel and sounds of the actual
medicament delivery device. For example, in some embodiments, the simulated medicament
delivery device can include external components (e.g., a housing, a needle guard, a sterile cover,
a safety lock or the like) that correspond to external components of the actual medicament
delivery device. In some embodiments, the simulated medicament delivery device can include

    WO 2014/106096                                                          PCT/US2013/078071
                                                 90
internal components (e.g., an actuation mechanism, a compressed gas source, a medicament
container or the like) that correspond to internal components of the actual medicament delivery
device.
[1285]      In some embodiments, however, the simulated medicament delivery device can be
devoid of a medicament and/or those components that cause the medicament to be delivered
(e.g., a needle, a nozzle or the like). In this manner, the simulated medicament delivery device
can be used to train a user in the use of the actual medicament delivery device without exposing
the user to a needle and/or a medicament. Moreover, the simulated medicament delivery device
can have features to identify it as a training device to prevent a user from mistakenly believing
that the simulated medicament delivery device can be used to deliver a medicament.            For
example, in some embodiments, the simulated medicament delivery device can be of a different
color than a corresponding actual medicament delivery device. Similarly, in some embodiments,
the simulated medicament delivery device can include a label clearly identifying it as a training
device.
[1286]      In some embodiments the medicament             delivery devices  and/or medicament
containers shown herein can include any suitable medicament, such as a vaccine. Such vaccines
can include, for example, an influenza A vaccine, an influenza B vaccine, an influenza A (HINI)
vaccine, a hepatitis A vaccine, a hepatitis B vaccine, a haemophilus influenza Type B (HiB)
vaccine, a measles vaccine, a mumps vaccine, a rubella vaccine, a polio vaccine, a human
papilloma virus (HPV) vaccine, a tetanus vaccine, a diphtheria vaccine, a pertussis vaccine, a
bubonic plague vaccine, a yellow fever vaccine, a cholera vaccine, a malaria vaccine, a cancer
vaccine, a smallpox vaccine, a pneumococcal vaccine, a rotavirus vaccine, a varicella vaccine, a
meningococcus vaccine and/or any combination thereof (e.g. tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis
vaccine). In other embodiments, the medicament delivery devices and/or medicament containers
shown herein can include epinephrine. In other embodiments, the medicament contained within
any of the medicament delivery devices and/or medicament containers shown herein can be
naloxone, including any of the naloxone formulations described in U.S. Patent No. 8,627,816,
entitled "Medicament Delivery Device for Administration of Opioid Antagonists Including
Formulation for Naloxone," filed on February 28, 2011.

     WO 2014/106096                                                          PCT/US2013/078071
                                               91
[1287]      In other embodiments, the medicament contained within any of the medicament
delivery devices and/or medicament containers shown herein can include insulin, glucagon,
human     growth hormone     (HGH),     erythropoiesis-stimulating   agents,   adalimumab,   other
monoclonal Antibodies (mAbs'), Interferon and other chronic therapies, or the like.           Such
formulations can be produced using a general lyophilization process with glucagon (of
recombinant or synthetic origin) using bulking agents, stabilizers, buffers, acidifying agents or
other excipients comprising of, but not limited to, one or more of the following combinations:
lactose, hydrochloric acid; glucose, histidine, hydrochloric acid; trehalose, mannitol, citrate;
trehalose, mannitol, hydrochloric acid; trehalose, glycine, hydrochloric acid; Mannitol, ascorbic
acid; and Glycine, hydrochloric acid.
[1288]      In other embodiments any of the medicament delivery devices and/or medicament
containers described herein can be filled with and/or used to inject medicament formulations,
including lyophilized biologics and/or biopharmaceuticals, such as, for example, canakinumab,
certolizumab, golimumab, and/or interleukins, for the treatment of crypyrin associated periodic
syndromes, hereditary andioedema, and other auto-immune diseases. In yet other embodiments,
any of the medicament delivery devices and/or medicament containers described herein can be
filled with and/or used to inject intranasal medicaments including small molecules such as
epinephrine, naloxone, diazepam, midazolam, lorazepam or biologics, such as glucagon or
human growth hormone, formulated for use in an auto injector, for the treatment of
musculoskeletal diseases, growth disorders, diabetes or other disorders.       Thus, although the
medicament delivery devices shown herein are primarily injectors, in other embodiments, a
medicament delivery device need not be a medical injector, but rather, can be an inhaler, a
wearable pump, an intranasal delivery device or the like.
[1289]      In other embodiments, any of the medicament delivery devices and/or medicament
containers described herein can be filled with and/or used to inject an anti-thrombolytic, such as
LMWH, ULMWH, Xa Inhibitors, biotinylated idraparinux, etc., for either the acute management
and/or surgical prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism or for the
management      of   other  conditions    which    may     require  anticoagulation   to   prevent
