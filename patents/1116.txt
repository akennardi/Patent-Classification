ABSTRACT
Wound dressings and systems are presented for treating a wound on a patient's limb, such as
a venous leg ulcer. The dressings and systems involve creating airflow within the dressing
(102) to vaporize and remove liquid. The airflow may begin when the dressing becomes
saturated. The dressings may be used to provide compression and reduced pres- sure to the
wound. Other systems and dressings are presented herein.

   DRESSINGS AND SYSTEMS FOR TREATING A WOUND ON A PATIENTS LIMB
                                EMPLOYING LIQUID CONTROL
RELATED APPLICATIONS
[0001]      The present invention claims the benefit, under 35 USC § 119(e), of the filing of U.S.
Provisional Patent Application serial number 61/558,544, entitled "Dressings, Systems, and
Methods for Treating a Wound on a Patient's Limb Employing Liquid Control," by Pratt et al.,
filed November 11, 2011, which is incorporated herein by reference for all purposes.
FIELD
[0002]      The present disclosure relates generally to medical treatment systems suitable for
use with venous leg ulcers (VLU) and, more particularly, but not by way of limitation, to
dressings, systems, and methods for treating a wound on a patient's limb, e.g., a venous leg
ulcer, that employs liquid control or management.
BACKGROUND
[0003]      Venous leg ulcers (VLU), which are sometimes called varicose or stasis ulcers, result
from damage to the valves in the veins of the legs, leading to raised venous pressure. VLUs
have a multi-faceted negative effect on the health and wellbeing of patients. Physical
symptoms include pain and immobility, which in turn, may lead to sleep disturbance, lack of
energy, work limitations, frustration, and a lack of self-esteem.
[0004]      The main treatment has been the application of compression to minimize edema or
swelling. Compression treatments include wearing compression stockings, multi-layer
compression wraps, or wrapping an ACE bandage or dressing from the toes or foot to the area
below the knee. Other wounds may also be experienced on limbs of a patient.
SUMMARY
[0005]      According to an illustrative embodiment, a wound dressing for treating a wound on a
patient's limb includes a tubular sleeve member for receiving the patient's limb and a pressure
source fluidly coupled to the tubular member. The tubular sleeve member includes an elastic
compression member formed as a sleeve having a first side and a second, patient-facing side
and a fluid-directing member having a first side and a second, patient-facing side. The first side

                                                 -2
of the fluid-directing member is disposed proximate to the second, patient-facing side of the
elastic compression member. The fluid-directing member is operable to inhibit fluids from
flowing through the fluid-directing member. The tubular sleeve member also includes a
pathway member having a first side and a second, patient-facing side. The first side of the
pathway member is proximate to the second, patient-facing side of the fluid-directing member.
The pathway member is operable to transport a fluid under a pressure gradient. The pressure
source is fluidly coupled to the pathway member for moving fluid therein. The wound dressing
further includes at least one exhaust port fluidly coupled to the pathway member for allowing
fluids to exit the wound dressing. The tubular sleeve member may also include one or more of
the following: an absorbent member, a transition member, or a patient-interface member.
[0006]      According to another illustrative embodiment, a dressing for treating a wound on a
patient's limb includes a means for compressing the limb proximate the wound and a means
for receiving liquid from the wound into the dressing. The dressing further includes a means for
forcing air to flow through the dressing to facilitate vaporization and removal of liquids from the
dressing.
[0007]      According to another illustrative embodiment, a method for treating a wound on a
patient's limb includes providing a wound dressing. The wound dressing includes a tubular
sleeve member that includes an elastic compression member formed into a sleeve having a
first side and a second, patient-facing side and a fluid-directing member having a first side and
a second, patient-facing side. The first side of the fluid-directing member is disposed proximate
to the second, patient-facing side of the elastic compression member. The fluid-directing
member is operable to inhibit fluids from flowing through the fluid-directing member. The
tubular sleeve member further includes a pathway member having a first side and a second,
patient-facing side. The first side of the pathway member is proximate to the second, patient
facing side of the fluid-directing member. The pathway member is operable to transport a fluid
under a pressure gradient. The method further includes disposing the wound dressing around
the patient's limb proximate to the wound, receiving liquid from the wound into the wound
dressing, and creating a pressure gradient within the wound dressing to cause air flow in the
wound dressing to evaporate liquid from the wound dressing. The air enters the wound
dressing at one location and is exhausted at another location.
[0008]      According to another illustrative embodiment, a method of manufacturing a wound
dressing for treating a wound on a patient's limb includes forming a tubular sleeve member for
receiving the limb of the patient. The step of forming a tubular sleeve member includes forming

                                                 -3
an elastic compression member as a sleeve having a first side and a second, patient-facing
side; forming a fluid-directing member having a first side and a second, patient-facing side; and
disposing the first side of the fluid-directing member proximate to the second, patient-facing
side of the elastic compression member. The fluid-directing member is operable to inhibit fluids
from flowing through the fluid-directing member. The step of forming a tubular sleeve member
further includes forming a pathway member having a first side and a second, patient-facing
side and disposing the first side of the pathway member proximate to the second, patient
facing side of the fluid-directing member. The pathway member is operable to transport a fluid
under a pressure gradient. The method of manufacturing a wound dressing further includes
fluidly coupling the pressure source to the pathway member for moving fluid therein.
[0009]      According to another illustrative embodiment, a system for treating a wound on a
patient's limb includes a wound dressing comprising a tubular sleeve member. The tubular
sleeve member includes a plurality of pressure compartments. Each pressure compartment is
operable to form a pressure gradient on a portion of the patient's limb. The system further
includes a pressure source that is fluidly and separately coupled to each of the pressure
compartments; and a controller coupled to the pressure source to control pressure delivery to
the plurality of pressure compartments. The controller and pressure source are operable to
cause a first pressure compartment of the plurality of pressure compartments to compress
around the patient's limb, then subsequently a second pressure compartment of the plurality of
pressure compartments to compress in order to encourage fluid movement in the patient's limb
from proximate the first pressure compartment towards the second pressure compartment.
[0010]      According to another illustrative embodiment, a method for treating a wound on a
patient's limb includes forming a plurality of pressure compartments on the patient's limb
proximate the wound, sequentially compressing each pressure compartment in a cephaladic
direction, and flowing air over a majority of the pressure compartments to vaporize and remove
liquid.
[0011]      Other aspects, features, and advantages of the illustrative embodiments will become
apparent with reference to the drawings and detailed description that follow.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS
[0024]      In the following detailed description of the illustrative, non-limiting embodiments,
reference is made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof. These embodiments
are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention, and
it is understood that other embodiments may be utilized and that logical structural, mechanical,
electrical, and chemical changes may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the
invention. To avoid detail not necessary to enable those skilled in the art to practice the
embodiments described herein, the description may omit certain information known to those
skilled in the art. The following detailed description is not to be taken in a limiting sense, and
the scope of the illustrative embodiments are defined only by the appended claims.
[0025]      In treating a venous leg ulcer (VLU) or other wounds, it is desirable to apply
compression, remove exudate, and control the liquid produced by the wound that is retained in
a dressing. VLU's produce considerable liquids that can saturate a dressing, cause an
undesirable odor, and cause maceration of healthy skin. The dressings and systems herein
control the liquid from the wound in a way to avoid one or more of these conditions.
[0026]      Referring to the figures, and initially to FIGURES 1-2, a dressing 102 for treating a
wound 104, such as a venous leg ulcer, on a limb 106 or extremity of a patient 108 is
presented. The wound 104 may involve epidermis 103, dermis 105, and subcutaneous tissue
107. The dressing 102 reduces the amount of liquid from the wound 104 that is retained within
the dressing 102 by using air movement to vaporize and remove fluids. The dressing 102 may
reduce odor and may facilitate an overall smaller size dressing than might otherwise be
possible. The dressing 102 may have a longer use time than otherwise possible.
[0027]      The dressing 102 includes a tubular sleeve member 110 for receiving the limb 106 or
extremity of the patient 108. The tubular sleeve member 110 has limb openings 112: a first
limb opening 114 and a second limb opening 116. The limb openings 112 allow the tubular
sleeve member 110 to receive the limb 106 therein. The tubular sleeve member 110 and the
limb openings 112 may be sized to accommodate different sized limbs 106.
[0028]      The tubular sleeve member 110 may include an elastic compression member 118
formed as a sleeve. The elastic compression member 118 is the outermost (furthest from
patient 108) member of the tubular sleeve member 110. The elastic compression member 118
has a first side 120 and a second, patient-facing side 122. The elastic compression member
118 may be formed from one or more of the following materials: Nylon Powernet material;

                                                  -6
Velband; materials with combinations of relatively non-elastic nylon fibers and highly-elastic
fibers (e.g., Spandex, Elastene); Lycra materials, stretch cotton; rubber materials; urethanes;
silicones; or other stretch based materials. The elastic compression member 118 is optional in
that an embodiment may be used as a dressing without this layer. In such a case, the next
layer, a fluid-directing member 124, may securely hold the dressing 102 in place.
[0029]      The tubular sleeve member 110 also includes the fluid-directing member 124. The
fluid-directing member 124 has a first side 126 and a second, patient-facing side 128. The first
side 126 of the fluid-directing member 124 is disposed proximate to the second, patient-facing
side 122 of the elastic compression member 118. The fluid-directing member 124 is operable
to inhibit fluids from flowing through the fluid-directing member 124. The fluid-directing member
may comprise one or more of the following: a polyurethane (PU) drape; an elastomer (e.g.,
natural rubbers, polyisoprene, styrene butadiene rubber, chloroprene rubber, polybutadiene,
nitrile rubber, butyl rubber, ethylene propylene rubber, ethylene propylene diene monomer,
chlorosulfonated polyethylene, polysulfide rubber, EVA film, co-polyester, and silicones;
silicone drape material; a 3M Tegaderm@ drape; or a polyurethane (PU) drape. The fluid
directing member 124 directs fluids so that airflow is primarily out of the exhaust ports.
[0030]      At the limb openings 112, the fluid-directing member 124 may extend beyond any
other layers to form an extension 130. The extension 130 forms a seal with the patient's
epidermis 103 as shown best in FIGURE 2. The extension 130 has a first side 134 and a
second, patient-facing side 136. An adhesive 138 is applied to the second, patient-facing side
136 of the extension 130 to facilitate attachment to the patient's epidermis 103. A port 140,
which depending on mode of operation is an intake port or an exhaust port, is formed through
the fluid-directing member 124 and any other members as necessary to access air beyond the
wound dressing 102. The port 140 allows fluid to enter or exit the wound dressing 102.
[0031]      As shown in FIGURE 3, in another illustrative embodiment, the elastic compression
member 118 and fluid-directing member 124 both extend over transverse edges 142 and,
because of compression, impinge upon the epidermis 103 to form a seal. In this embodiment,
the port 140 extends through both the elastic compression member 118 and fluid- directing
member 124. In still another embodiment, all the layers may be coterminous and the entire
edge may serve to exhaust vapor.
[0032]       Referring again primarily to FIGURE 2, the tubular sleeve member 110 further
includes a pathway member 144. The pathway member 144 has a first side 146 and a second,

                                                -7
patient-facing side 148. The first side 146 of the pathway member 144 is proximate to the
second, patient-facing side 128 of the fluid-directing member 124. The pathway member 144 is
operable to transport a fluid under a pressure gradient. The pathway member 144 functions to
present pathways that allow a gas to flow and has sufficient rigidity to allow pathways to
remain open even when compressed during use. The pathway member 144 may comprise one
or more of the following: open-cell foam; non-woven material (e.g., Libeltex Hydrophobic non
woven); or Vilmed range from Freundenberg 1522. As suggested by arrows 150 in FIGURE 2,
air moves within the pathway member 144. Arrows 150 show airflow in one direction, but
another direction is possible as is explained elsewhere.
[0033]     The tubular sleeve member 110 may optionally include an absorbent member 152.
The absorbent member 152 at least temporarily retains liquids from the wound 104 away from
the patient's epidermis 103. The absorbent member 152 has a first side 154 and a second,
patient-facing side 156. The first side 154 of the absorbent member 152 is proximate to the
second, patient-facing side 148 of the pathway member 144. The absorbent member 152 acts
as a buffer to hold liquid from the wound 104 while waiting for the liquid to be evaporated and
carried away by airflow in the pathway member 144. The absorbent member 152 may be any
material that functions to hold liquid. The absorbent member 152 may be formed from one or
more of the following: a super absorbent polymer material (e.g., LUQUAFLEECE from BASF),
Vilmed range from Freundenberg 1522, or other material.
[0034]     The tubular sleeve member 110 may optionally include a transition member 158. The
transition member 158 may be formed from the same materials as the pathway member 144.
The transition member 158 has a first side 160 and a second, patient-facing side 162. The first
side 160 of the transition member 158 is disposed proximate to the second, patient-facing side
156 of the absorbent member 152. The transition member 158 wicks liquids from the wound
104 to help keep fluids away from the epidermis 103 or wound 104.
[0035]     The tubular sleeve member 110 may optionally include a patient- interface member
164 that has a first side 166 and a second, patient-facing side 168. The first side 166 of the
patient- interface member 164 is disposed proximate to the second, patient-facing side 162 of
the transition member 158 or the second, patient-facing side 156 of the absorbent member
152. The second, patient-facing side 168 of the patient-interface member 164 is for disposing
proximate to the patient 108. The patient- interface member 164 is designed to be against the
epidermis 103 for extended periods of time and may include an anti-microbial material, e.g.,

                                                -8
silver. The patient-interface member 164 may be formed from a Silver Miliken or other
material.
[0036]      A pressure source 170 is fluidly coupled to the tubular sleeve member 110. The
pressure source 170 may be, for example, a reduced-pressure source or a positive pressure
source. Thus, the pressure source 170 may be a micro-pump 172 as shown in FIGURE 2, a
remote reduced-pressure source 174 as shown in FIGURE 10, a wall-based suction source, or
a wall-based positive pressure source.
[0037]      As suggested by arrows 176 in FIGURE 1, the pressure source 170 may be
configured to pull air into the wound dressing 102 at an inboard location. The wound dressing
102 may be configured to discharge the air at the edges. The air is discharged through one
port 140 at the limb opening 112 as suggested by arrows 178. Alternatively, the pressure
source 170 may be configured to pull air as suggested by arrows 180 in FIGURE 10 from the
limb openings 112 to the pressure source 170 and then exhaust the air at the reduced
pressure source 174.
[0038]      The wound dressing 102 includes at least two ports: port 140 and port 182. The limb
openings 112 typically include at least one port 140. As shown best in FIGURE 4, a plurality of
ports 140 may be included. The port or ports 140 may function as exhaust ports or intake ports
depending on the configuration of the pressure source 170. Thus, in FIGURES 1-2, the port
140 is an exhaust port. In FIGURE 10, the ports 140 are intake ports. The port 182 is
associated with the pressure source 170 and may include an extension portion 185 to provide
fluid communication with a desired layer of the wound dressing 102. For example, the
extension portion 185 may fluidly couple the pressure source 170 to the pathway member 144
as shown in FIGURE 2 or to another layer if desired.
[0039]      The pressure source 170 causes a pressure gradient in the wound dressing 102 that
will move air. Depending on how the wound dressing 102 is configured, air either enters at the
edges (e.g., at the limb opening 112) and moves to port 182 or enters at the port 182 and
moves to the limb opening 112 and out ports 140. The ports 140 and 182 may both may be
inboard if a compartment wall is used as is described elsewhere herein. The pressure gradient
is typically established primarily in the pathway member 144, but may be established in other
layers in some embodiments.

                                                  -9
[0040]      Each port 140, 182 may have a filter associated with the port 140, 182. For example,
a filter 184 is associated with port 140, and a filter 186 is associated with port 182. The filters
184, 186 may be odor filters, e.g., charcoal filters, or anti-bacterial filters. In FIGURE 2, the
filter 184 is a charcoal filter for removing odor from the airflow before the airflow is released
into the atmosphere. The filter 186 is an intake filter for removing bacteria before the air enters
the wound dressings 102. In FIGURE 10, the intake filters (not explicitly shown) associated
with ports 140 are anti-bacterial intake filters.
[0041]      Of the various layers mentioned (e.g., elastic compression member 118, fluid
directing member 124, pathway member 144, absorbent member 152, transition member 158,
and patient- interface member 164), some may be omitted, some combined, and some
rearranged. As a few non-exhaustive examples, consider the embodiments of FIGURES 5-8.
In FIGURE 5, the tubular sleeve member 110 of the wound dressing 102 comprises only an
elastic compression member 118, a fluid-directing member 124, and pathway member 144. In
FIGURE 6, the tubular sleeve member 110 of the wound dressing 102 comprises an elastic
compression member 118, a fluid-directing member 124, pathway member 144, and an
absorbent member 152. In FIGURE 7, the tubular sleeve member 110 of the wound dressing
102 comprises an elastic compression member 118, a fluid-directing member 124, pathway
member 144, an absorbent member 152, and a transition member 158. In FIGURE 8, the
tubular sleeve member 110 of the wound dressing 102 comprises an elastic compression
member 118, a fluid-directing member 124, and a woven-open-structure member 188. The
woven-open-structure member 188 functionally combines the pathway member 144, absorbent
member 152, and the transition member 158 into one material. The woven-open-structure
member 188 is operable to retain fluids and at the same time allow gases to move in the
woven-open-structure member 188. The woven-open-structure member 188 may be formed
from Vilmed range from Freundenberg 1522 or other similar material, for example.
[0042]      Referring now to FIGURE 9, another illustrative embodiment of a wound dressing
102 for treating a wound 104 on a limb 106 of a patient 108 is presented. The cross section is
a medial cross section of the limb 106 with the wound dressing 102 applied thereto. The
wound dressing 102 is analogous in most respects to the wound dressing of FIGURES 1-2,
except the elastic compression member 118 is omitted and additional features added as will be
explained. The wound dressing 102 may be formed as an annular sleeve, as an isolated
dressing, or island dressing. The wound dressing 102 may be used with or without
compression. If compression is desired, the compression is developed by application of the

                                                - 10
fluid-directing member 124 in tension. The wound dressing 102 is held by adhesive 138 to the
patient 108.
[0043]      In this embodiment, a control subsystem 202 is included. The control subsystem 202
includes at least one saturation sensor 190. The saturation sensor 190 is coupled to the
absorbent member 152. In other embodiments, the saturation sensor 190 may be coupled to
other layers, e.g., the transition member 158. The saturation sensor 190 may be a galvanic cell
with two electrodes that produce voltage when saturated, a resistive pathway that is completed
by exudate, or a capacitor-based sensor.
[0044]     The saturation sensor 190 is coupled to a control circuit or controller 192. The
controller 192 is configured to monitor the saturation sensor 190. When the controller 192
detects a change indicative that the absorbent member 152 is saturated or partially saturated,
the controller 192 activates the pressure source 170 in response. The pressure source in this
embodiment pulls gas from the port 182 and discharges the gas to the atmosphere as
suggested by arrows 194. The air is pulled from the transverse edges 142 through one or more
ports 140. In this embodiment, the ports 140 may have a control valve 196 associated with
each port 140. The control valve 196 may be wirelessly or electrically coupled by a lead 199 to
the controller 192. The control valve 196 regulates air flow through the one or more ports 140
to keep air moving in the wound dressing 102, but also to control the rate such that, if desired,
a reduced pressure may be maintained in a sealed space 198 at a desired level.
[0045]     As an alternative to the control valve 196, controlled leaks in the fluid-directing
member 124 may be used. The controlled leaks allow air to flow in at or near the transverse
edges 142 towards the pressure source 170. For example, apertures (not explicitly shown) in
the fluid-directing member 124 may be covered by an adhesive film that is removed later when
a leak is desired.
[0046]     With the embodiment of FIGURE 9, a reduced pressure may be applied to the
wound 104 and liquids removed and managed. The reduced pressure is initially applied by the
pressure source 170. When sufficient liquids reach the absorbent member 152 and saturate
the absorbent member 152, the control valve 196 may be at least partially opened to allow
some fluid flow into the wound dressing 102 and at the same time the pressure source 170
may be sufficiently increased to hold the desired reduced pressure notwithstanding the
introduction of air through ports 140. As shown in the diagram of FIGURE 11, a display 200
may be added to the control subsystem 202 to provide feedback to a user. The display 200

                                                - 11
may be a series of LED indicators, a bi-stable LCD type, or other compact display. The display
200 is compact and low power. The display 200 may display information such as remaining
battery capacity, duration of therapy, and the fill status of the dressing as well as confirmation
that the system is operating within its normal parameters.
[0047]      Referring now primarily to FIGURE 10, another illustrative embodiment of a wound
dressing 102 for treating a wound 104 on a limb 106 of a patient 108 is presented. The wound
dressing 102 is analogous to those previously presented, except in this embodiment, the
pressure source 170 is a remote reduced-pressure source 174. The remote reduced-pressure
source 174 is fluidly coupled by a pressure conduit 204 to the tubular sleeve member 110. A
pressure interface 206 may be used to fluidly couple the pressure conduit 204 to the intake
port (see port 182 in FIG. 2). The intake port is at an inboard location on the wound dressing
102. In one illustrative embodiment, the pressure interface 206 is a T.R.A.C.* Pad or Sensa
T.R.A.C.* Pad available from KCI of San Antonio, Texas, or another interface. In another
embodiment, a "bridge" (an open-cell foam or other passageway material enclosed in a gas
impermeable material) is used to deliver reduced pressure to the wound dressing 102.
[0048]      Referring now primarily to FIGURE 11, the control subsystem 202 includes a
controller 192 that is coupled to a saturation sensor 190 and to a pressure source 170. In
addition, a control valve 196 may be coupled to the controller 192 and also a display 200. The
control subsystem 202 may control the leak rate by opening the control valve 196 when
included or may turn on, turn off, increase, or decrease the pressure produced by the pressure
source 170. As used through out this document, "or" does not require mutual exclusivity. The
control valve 196 may be a solenoid valve such a Pneutronics X valve with a fixed size orifice
from Parker Hannifin, Cleveland, Ohio; a mechanical proportional valve; or a PZT proportional
valve such as those supplied by Festo.
[0049]      It should be understood that the control subsystem 202 of FIGURE 11 or aspects of
the control subsystem 202 may be applied to any of the embodiments herein. Thus, for
example, when the control subsystem 202 is added to the wound dressing 102 in FIGURES 1
2, the saturation sensor 190 and controller 192 determine when the absorbent member 152 is
saturated or partially saturated. The controller 192 may then activate the pressure source 170
to initiate airflow in the wound dressing 102 to evaporate and remove liquids from the wound
dressing 102. The sensor 109 and controller 192 may detect saturation as a scale. The
duration of the airflow or the speed of the airflow may be set by the controller 192 in response
to the degree of saturation involved. The control system 202 may also display information such

                                                - 12
as remaining battery capacity, duration of therapy, and the fill status of the dressing as well as
confirmation that the system is operating within its normal parameters.
[0050]      Referring now primarily to FIGURE 12, another illustrative embodiment of a wound
dressing 102 is presented. The wound dressing 102 is analogous in most respects to the
previously presented wound dressings, except in this embodiment, a plurality of pressure
compartments 208 are added and are used to massage the limb 106. Each pressure
compartment 208 is operable to form a pressure gradient on a portion of the patient's limb 106
to move air for the purposes previously presented. In addition, the pressure compartments
208, which are formed with a plurality of compartment walls 209, allow squeezing or
sequenced movement in a cephaladic direction.
[0051]      A pressure source 170 is fluidly coupled separately to each of the pressure
compartments 208 by a plurality of pressure conduits 205. Each pressure compartment 208
has a pressure interface 206 for fluidly coupling the pressure conduit 205 to the pressure
compartment 208. Each pressure conduit 205 is also fluidly coupled to the pressure source
170.
[0052]      A controller 192 is coupled to the pressure source 170 to control pressure delivery to
the plurality of pressure compartments 208. The controller 192 and pressure source 170 are
operable to cause a first pressure compartment 210 of the plurality of pressure compartments
208 to compress around the patient's limb 106, then subsequently a second pressure
compartment 212 of the plurality of pressure compartments 208 to compress around the
patient's limb 106 in order to encourage fluid movement in the patient's limb 106 from
proximate the first pressure compartment 210 towards the second pressure compartment 212.
The coordinated compression of pressure compartments 208 may continue with the others.
[0053]      The pressure source 170 may have a controller 192 associated with the pressure
source 170. The controller 192 may be configured to control a plurality of pumps within the
pressure source 170 or a plurality of valves (not explicitly shown) to allow varying pressure
within the pressure compartments 208. The controller 192 can sequentially supply a pressure
gradient to the pressure compartments 208 to cause sequential compression of the
compartments on the patient's limb 106. The sequential compression of each pressure
compartment results in moving fluids in the patient's limb in a cephaladic direction (in the
direction that goes from the feet towards the head). This motion thus creates a massage like

                                                   - 13
motion on the limb 106. At the same time, as with the previous embodiments, air flow may be
introduced into the wound dressing 102 to facilitate evaporation and removal of liquids.
[0054]      The compression of each pressure compartment 208 may be achieved using
positive pressure or reduced pressure from the pressure source 170. If positive pressure is
used, the pressure compartments 208 may include bladders that fill to cause compression. If
reduced pressure is used, the reduced pressure may cause the fluid-directing member 124 to
pull down on the other layers which act as a bolster and thereby generate a compressive force.
[0055]      With reference generally to the figures, in operation according to one illustrative
embodiment, a wound dressing 102 is provided. The wound dressing 102 may be any of those
presented or suggested herein or combinations thereof. The wound dressing 102 includes a
tubular sleeve member 110. The wound dressing 102 is disposed around the patient's limb 106
proximate to the wound 104. This may entail sliding the patient's limb 106 through the limb
openings 112 or using an open and closeable seam (not explicitly shown).
[0056]       Once the wound dressing 102 is in place on the limb 106, the wound dressing 102
may receive liquid from the wound 104 into the wound dressing 102. Either all the time, in
response to saturation or partial saturation, or based on a timer, the pressure source 170 is
activated. The pressure source 170 creates a pressure gradient within the wound dressing 102
that causes air flow in the wound dressing 102 to evaporate liquid from the wound dressing
102. The air enters the wound dressing 102 at one location (e.g., port 182 or port 140) and is
exhausted at another location (e.g., port 140 or 182).
[0057]      The air typically will travel within the wound dressing 102 at a rate of at least 0.1 m/s
and is typically in the range 0.01 (or less) to 0.2 m/s. If a saturation sensor 190 and controller
192 are included, they may detect when the saturation has dropped below a threshold level
and then signal the pressure source 170 to cease. With spaced intake and exhaust ports, the
air will flow over a large portion of the interior of the wound dressing 102. For example, the air
may flow over 50 percent, 75 percent, 90% percent or more of the surface area of the pathway
member 144 (or other layer if coupled to another layer).
[0058]       In operation according to another illustrative embodiment, reduced pressure may
also be applied to the wound 104 as an aspect of treatment. For example, with respect to
FIGURE 9, the control valve 196 may remain closed or restricted while reduced pressure is
applied to the sealed space 198 to allow the creation of reduced pressure in the sealed space

                                                 - 14
198. The pressure may be, for example, without limitation, in the -25 mm Hg to -200 mm Hg
range. If saturation is detected, the control valve 196 may be opened to allow for increased air
flow. In addition, the output of the pressure source 170 may be increased to allow the reduced
pressure level to be maintained in the sealed space 198 notwithstanding the leak or bleeding
of air.
[0059]      The air entering or exiting the wound dressing 102 through ports 140 and 182 may
first go through a filter 184, 186. The filters 184, 186 remove bacteria or odor. The intake filter
will keep bacteria from entering the wound dressing 102 and potentially infecting the wound
104. The exit filter helps remove particulates or remove odors. The configuration of the
pressure source 170 determines whether a filter is an intake filter or exit filter.
[0060]      According to another illustrative embodiment, a method of manufacturing a wound
dressing 102 for treating a wound 104 on a patient's limb 106 is contemplated. The method
includes forming a tubular sleeve member 110 for receiving the patient's lower extremity or
limb 106. The step of forming the tubular sleeve member 110 includes forming an elastic
compression member 118 as a sleeve having a first side 120 and a second, patient-facing side
122; forming a fluid-directing member 124 having a first side 126 and a second, patient-facing
side 128; and disposing the first side 126 of the fluid-directing member 124 proximate to the
second, patient-facing side 122 of the elastic compression member 118. The fluid-directing
member 124 is operable to inhibit fluids from flowing through the fluid-directing member 124.
The step of forming the tubular sleeve member 110 further includes forming a pathway
member 144 having a first side 146 and a second, patient-facing side 148 and disposing the
first side 146 of the pathway member 144 proximate to the second, patient-facing side 128 of
the fluid-directing member 124. The pathway member 144 is operable to transport a fluid under
a pressure gradient. The method further includes fluidly coupling the pressure source 170 to
the pathway member 144 for moving fluid therein.
[0061]      With respect to the preceding method, the step of forming a tubular sleeve member
110 may further include disposing an absorbent member 152, which is for at least temporarily
retaining liquids, into the wound dressing 102. The absorbent member 152 has a first side 154
and a second, patient-facing side 156. The first side 154 of the absorbent member 152 is
disposed proximate to the second, patient-facing side 148 of the pathway member 144. The
step of forming a tubular sleeve member 110 may further include disposing a transition
member 158 proximate to the absorbent member 152 or disposing the patient-interface

                                                -15
member 164 into the wound dressing 102. One or more layers may be omitted and the order of
the layers may be varied.
[0062]     While air flow through the pathway member 144 is a prominent illustrative
embodiment, it should be noted that the wound dressing 102 may be configured to
accommodate air flow in others layers except the fluid-directing member 124. Thus, for
example and without limitation, the extension portion 185 (FIG. 2) of the port 182 may extend
to the absorbent member 152 or the transition member 158 to cause airflow primarily therein.
[0063]     It should be understood that airflow may be from an inboard location to the
transverse edges 142, from the transverse edges 142 to an inboard location, or from an
inboard location to another inboard location. With respect to the lastly mentioned flow pattern
and with general reference to FIGURES 2 and 3, an embodiment of a wound dressing 102 has
the intake port and exhaust port that are both inboard of the transverse edges 142, but
separated by a medial compartment wall (not shown, but analogous to compartment wall 209
in FIG. 12 and running medially). In this latter embodiment, the transverse edges 142 are
sealed, air enters the intake port proximate to the compartment wall, the air transversely flows
around the limb 106, and then the air exits the exhaust port proximate to the compartment wall
but on the opposite side from the intake port.
[0064]     The wound dressings 102 herein may require fewer changes than other wound
dressings because of the liquid management, i.e., the liquid removed by the airflow. The liquid
management may also avoid maceration on the patient. The wound dressings 102 may
provide less odor and bulk than other dressings. The wound dressing 102 may process more
liquid over time that the dressing is otherwise capable of retaining.
[0065]     Although the present invention and its advantages have been disclosed in the
context of certain illustrative, non-limiting embodiments, it should be understood that various
changes, substitutions, permutations, and alterations can be made without departing from the
scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims. It will be appreciated that any
feature that is described in connection to any one embodiment may also be applicable to any
other embodiment. For example, the control subsystem 202 of FIGURE 11 may be added to
any of the other embodiments. As another example, pressure compartments 208 of FIGURE
12 may be added to any of the other wound dressings 102 herein. As another example, the
tubular sleeve members 110 shown in FIGURES 5-8 may be used with any of the wound
dressing 102 embodiments herein.
