           Permeability Flow Cell and Hydraulic Conductance System
                                 FIELD OF THE INVENTION
        The present invention relates to devices and methods for measuring the permeability
of dentin. More particularly, the invention relates to devices and methods of quickly and
accurately measuring the permeability of dentin using a flow cell.
                           BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
        Tooth sensitivity affects numerous people. It is often caused by eating or drinking
something hot, cold, sweet or acidic. Under normal conditions, the papal chamber, which
houses the blood vessels and nerves, is surrounded by the dentin, which in turn is covered by
the enamel in the tooth crown, and the gums that surround the tooth. Over time, the enamel
covering can get thinner, thus providing less protection. The gums can also recede over time,
exposing the underlying root surface dentin.
        The dentin contains a large numbers of pores or tubule orifices that run from the
outside of the tooth to the nerve at its center. When the dentin is exposed, these tubule
orifices can be stimulated by temperature changes or certain foods. The hydrodynamic
theory of dentin sensitivity states that stimuli applied to exposed dentin tubule orifices cause
a movement of fluids in the tubules which, in turn, stimulates nerves in the pulp.
        The well-know Pashley method for determining dentin permeability has been used as
an in vitro model for screening agents which have been used to desensitize dentin. In this
method, fluid is forced from an inlet across (or through) one side of a dentin disc sample to
the other side and, then, its flow rate measured to determine the rate of fluid flow across the
dentin sample. The prepared disc sample of dentin is secured in a split-chamber device,
clamped between two paired "0" rings.
        Certain limitations, however, exist regarding the Pashley method and generally relate
to inherent inaccuracies affecting the overall accuracy of the method's permeability
measurements. Moreover, the design of the flow cell used in the Pashley method does not
allow for easy removal of the dentin sample during dentin permeability analysis to, for
example perform further challenge to the dentin sample's surface and, then, return the dentin
sample back to the flow cell for continued analysis.
                                                  1

        Another limitation of the Pashley method relates to its inability to standardize the
flow rates obtained across different dentin samples when permeability data for more than one
dentin sample is necessary or desired.
        As a result of these limitations, large sample sizes are required to achieve statistically
significant dentin permeability readings.
        The search for faster and more accurate methods of measuring the permeability of
dentin using a modified flow cells and/or permeability measurement methods continues.
Desired aspects for these methods include high accuracy and throughput (i.e., performing
technology testing quickly and reliably producing sound data), data separation, error
reduction, robustness, repeatability, and use with additional testing methods.

                    DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
        The devices, apparatus and methods of the present invention can comprise, consist of,
or consist essentially of the essential elements and limitations of the invention described
herein, as well any of the additional or optional components, or limitations described herein.
        The term "comprising" (and its grammatical variations) as used herein is used in the
inclusive sense of "having" or "including" and not in the exclusive sense of "consisting only
of." The terms "a" and "the" as used herein are understood to encompass the plural as well as
the singular.
        All patent documents incorporated herein by reference in their entirety are only
incorporated herein to the extent that they are not inconsistent with this specification.
        The term "flat" as used herein means having a horizontal surface without a slope, tilt,
or curvature; or, having a smooth, even, level surface.
        As used herein the phrase "reversible securing mechanism" means a securing
mechanism which does not secure items (such as a dentin sample) permanently (i.e., as by
gluing or cementing), but which after the item is secured, permits adjustment such that the
item can be readily returned to its unsecured state. The present invention is a devices and
methods for measuring the permeability of dentin.
        FIG. 1 is a vertical sectional view of the prior art flow cell for use in measuring the
permeability of dentin prior to sealing the flow cell. The prior art flow cell is generally
                                                 12

cylindrical in shape. The figure shows the two-part cell with base component 10 and lid
component 50. Lid component 50 includes inner surface 52, outer surface 54, screw threads
58 disposed on inner surface 52, and through-hole 56.
         Base component 10 includes inner surface 12, outer surface 14, lip 16, screw threads
18 disposed on outer surface 14, and inlet 22 and outlet 24 channels. Inlet 22 and outlet 24
channels have "press-fit" connections to inlet and outlet tubes. As used herein, the term
"press fit" (also referred to as "interference fit" or "friction fit") means the fastening of two
parts achieved by friction between the parts after the parts are joined (e.g., as by pressing or
pushing) together, instead of by any other type of fastening. The cylindrical shape of base
component 10 defines inner chamber 20. The components which occupy inner chamber 20
of base component 10 for use in measuring the permeability of dentin sample 70 include top
spacer 32 and bottom spacer 36, as well as "O"-rings 42 and 46 and larger sized "O"-rings
44, and 48. Top spacer 32 has through-hole 34, and bottom spacer 36 has through-hole 38.
         The components which occupy inner chamber 20 of base component 10 of the prior
art flow cell are assembled in the form of a stack as follows: bottom spacer 36 is placed on
"O"-ring 48, which "0" ring 48 rests on the inner surface 12 of base component 10. "0"
rings 46 and 44 are placed on bottom spacer 36. Second side 74 of dentin sample 70 is
placed on "O"-ring 46. "O"-ring 42 is placed on first side 72 of dentin sample 70. Top spacer
32 is placed on "O"-rings 42 and 44.
         FIG. 2 shows the prior art flow cell after the sealing of the cell. To seal the cell, lid
component 50 is screwed onto base component 10, with screw threads 58 disposed on inner
surface 52 of lid component 50 matched with screw threads 18 disposed on outer surface 14,
of base component 10.
         The permeability of dentin sample 70 is measured using the prior art flow method and
cell in the following manner. Once the two-part cell is assembled, outlet channel 24 is
sealed. Pressure is used to induce fluid (e.g., distilled water) flow in inlet channel 22. Fluid
flows into the portion of inner chamber 20 of base component 10 below dentin sample 70
from inlet channel 22. As the fluid pressure rises in the portion of inner chamber 20 below
dentin sample 70, the fluid flows through through-hole 38 of bottom spacer 36. Increased
fluid pressure then initiates fluid flow through (or across) the dentin sample 70 (i.e., through
or across the dentin tubule or orifices in the dentin sample). Fluid flow continues through
through-hole 34 of top spacer 32, and exits prior art flow cell through through-hole 56 of lid
component 50.
                                                  13

         The limitations of the Pashley method involve inherent inaccuracies in the Pashley
flow cell. These inaccuracies include stacking error due to the number of flow cell
components (i.e., the "O"-rings [four] and spacers [two]) as well as increased leaking
potential. Leaks around the dentin sample are often caused by the user inaccurately placing
the "O"-rings and spacers when assembling the cell. These leaks around the dentin sample
result in an inaccurate measurement of permeability through the dentin.
         Moreover, the "O"-rings used with the Pashley flow cell have round cross-sections.
These "O"-rings have a single line of contact with the dentin sample once the components are
arranged and the flow cell sealed as illustrated in FIG. 2. If the "O"-rings are formed of a
"stiff' material, the risk of leakage in the system is increases. To alleviate this risk, the user
typically adds extra vertical pressure to the "O"-rings when sealing the flow cell. Such
additional vertical pressure, however, creates (or increases) the risk of damaging the dentin
sample. On the other hand, if the "O"-rings are formed of a "soft" material, the "O"-rings
will deform, and flatten against the dentin sample, changing the area of the dentin sample
exposed to the fluid in the flow cell. Such inconsistency in the area of the dentin sample
exposed to the fluid in the flow cell can result in inconsistent measurements of permeability
through the dentin.
         Another issue with the Pashley flow cell is that during the assembly of the cell, lid
component 50 is screwed onto base component 10, with screw threads 58 disposed on inner
surface 52 of lid component 50 matched with screw threads 18 disposed on outer surface 14,
of base component 10, rotating lid component 50 relative to base component 10. The
rotational movement of the lid component 50 with respect to the base component 10 often
causes rotation of the dentin sample, the "O"-rings and/or the spacers, which can result in
leaks (or increased leakage) around the dentin sample. These leaks around the dentin sample
result in an inaccurate measurement of permeability through the dentin.
         Yet another issue with the Pashley flow cell relates to the previously mentioned
"press-fit" connections between inlet and outlet tubes and the inlet channel 22 and outlet 24
channel, respectively. Such "press-fit" connections often leak, especially under pressure,
resulting in inaccuracies in flow rate measurements.
         Furthermore, the Pashley method fails to provide for standardization of flow rates
across a variety of different dentin samples when permeability data of more than one dentin
sample is necessary or desired. Such standardizing of flow rates across different dentin
samples would alleviate the need, in comparative analyses, to correct for such dentin sample
variables as thickness and porosity. Typical dentin permeability flow rate methods measure
                                                  14

the fluid flow rate across a particular dentin sample at a set generated (and maintained)
pressure. For example, at a set pressure of, say, 0.75 psi, the fluid flow rate of one dentin
sample might read 3ul/min, but the fluid flow rate of a second dentin sample at the same
(0.75 psi) pressure might read 1Oul/min, and the fluid flow rate of a third dentin sample at the
same (0.75 psi) pressure might read lul/min, etc. Differences in the mentioned dentin
thickness and porosity variables primarily account for these fluid flow rate differences at a set
(and maintained) pressure. To correct for these difference in fluid flow rates, the fluid flow
rates of the different dentin samples are typically normalized. The term "normalized" as used
herein means dividing every measurement for a given dentin sample by that sample's
baseline (i.e., prior to treatment) flow rate measurement (see "Residual Permeability" formula
at Example 1). By regulating the system pressures to less than or equal to 30 psi (or about30
psi) and maintaining the system pressure with minimal fluctuation (i.e., less than or equal to
0.1 psi) using a high precision pressure regulator, the present invention permits such
standardization (i.e., establishing the same fluid flow rate for each dentin sample) across a
variety of different dentin samples.
        FIGs. 3 through 8 are views of the two-part flow cell 100 for use in the present
invention. FIG. 3 is a top view of the bottom component 110 of flow cell 100, while FIG. 4
is a vertical sectional view of FIG. 3 along the 4-4 plane. Bottom component 110 of the
flow cell includes bottom surface 112, top surface 114, first indent 116, groove 118, second
indent 119 which defines inner chamber 130, fastener blind holes 135 (or other suitable
mechanism for engaging fasteners), inlet channel 144 in flow communication with optional
secondary inlet channel 142, and venting channel 148 in flow communication with optional
secondary venting channel 146. In certain embodiments, inlet channel 144 and venting
channel 148 are positioned opposite or substantially opposite each other. Inlet channel 144
and venting channel 148 each have an inner end, 144a and 148a, respectively, the inner
openings, 144a and 148a, joining inlet channel 144 and venting channel 148 to the inner
chamber 130. The inner openings, 144a and 148a, further define the point from which inlet
channel 144 and venting channel 148 extend outwardly from the flow cell 100. The bottom
component 110 comprises an opening 132 at the top of the inner chamber 130 for accessing
the inner chamber 130. Inlet channel 144 is positioned in flow communication with inner
chamber 130. Venting channel 148 is also positioned in flow communication with inner
chamber 130. Inlet channel 144 and venting channel 148 (or, if present, optional secondary
inlet channel 142 and optional secondary venting channel 146) can be, optionally, threaded to
receive the compatibly threaded ends of inlet and outlet tubes 238 and 254, respectively.
                                                 15

Optionally, and as shown on the vertical cross-sectional view of the bottom compartment at
FIG. 4, venting channel 148 forms a positive angle 0 relative to a bottom side of a horizontal
cross-sectional plane XY through the bottom component 110 and intersecting the inner end
148a of venting channel 148, angle 0 having its vertex at the point of intersection of the inner
end 148a and the horizontal cross-sectional plane XY. Angle 0, as measured from the bottom
side of the horizontal cross-sectional plane XY counter clockwise (as illustrated at FIG. 4),
ranges from greater than about 0' to less than about 900, optionally from about 15 to about
75, optionally from about 35to about 55, or, optionally about 60'. Optionally, and as shown
on the vertical cross-sectional view of the bottom compartment at FIG. 4, inlet channel 144
forms a positive angle   # relative to a bottom side of a horizontal cross-sectional plane X'Y'
through the bottom component 110 and intersecting the inner end 144a of inlet channel 144,
angle  # having  its vertex at the point of intersection of the inner end 144a and the horizontal
cross-sectional plane X'Y'. Angle *, as measured from bottom side of the horizontal cross
sectional plane X'Y' counter clockwise (as illustrated at FIG. 4), ranges from about 0' to
less than or equal to about 270', optionally from about 90' to about 1800, optionally from
about 100' to about 130', or, optionally about 1160. (For purposes of illustrating angles 0
and *, FIG. 4 shows the cross-sectional planes XY and X'Y' perpendicular to, and coming
out of the paper along the x axis and the x' axis, respectively.)
        FIG. 5 is a top view of the lid 150 for flow cell 100, while FIG. 6 is a vertical
sectional view of FIG. 5 along the 6--6 plane. The lid 150 of the flow cell includes bottom
surface 152, top surface 154, bottom groove 158, optional fastener through-holes 175 (or
other suitable mechanism for engaging fasteners), and flow outlet channel 160. Flow outlet
channel 160 is defined by walls 156 on lid 150 vertically, radially and conically skewed
toward the center of the lid 150, increases the diameter of the out flow of fluid through flow
outlet channel 160.
        In certain embodiments, lid 150 and bottom component 110 are shaped to fit one in
the other so as to permit a secure engagement between the two components. The lid 150 and
bottom component 110 components may be formed from machined glasses; woods; metals,
such as stainless steel; plastics, such as polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) or polycarbonate
(PC); or a combination of these materials. In one embodiment, lid 150 and bottom
component 110 are formed from (e.g., by machining) optically clear or transparent PMMA,
such as that available from MacMaster-Carr (Catalogue #8560K912 or #8560K265) of
Robbinsville, NJ. The advantage of using a clear (e.g., optically clear or transparent) material
                                                   16

in forming flow cell 100 is that clear materials allow "line of sight" into the cell or otherwise
makes the contents of the cell visible to the unaided eye to, for example, help in visually
determining whether all air in the form of air bubble(s) has been purged from the portion of
inner chamber 130 below dentin sample 190 flows. An air bubble below dentin sample 190
decreases the area of dentin sample 190 through which fluid can flow through. As a
reminder, the inability to consistently determine the area of the dentin sample exposed to the
fluid flow cell 100 may result in an inconsistent measurement of permeability through the
dentin.
         FIG. 7 shows the flow cell for use in the present invention with dentin sample 190 in
place prior to the sealing of the flow cell, while FIG. 8 shows the flow cell with a dentin
sample in place after the sealing of the cell. The components which occupy the flow cell of
the present invention include first and second washers 182 and 184, and dentin sample 190.
Dentin sample 190 has first side 192 and second side 194.
         The flow cell is assembled as follows. First washer 182 is placed in groove 118 of
bottom component 110. Second washer 184 is placed in bottom groove 158 of lid 150. In
certain embodiments, groove 118 of bottom component 110, and bottom groove 158 of lid
150 are machined to fit the width dimensions of any washer(s) used (such as washers 182 and
184) so as to reduce, minimize or prevent any displacement of the washer(s): i) as the
components of the flow cell are being secured for use (e.g., testing and/or fluid flow
measurement); and/or ii) during actual use (e.g., testing and/or fluid flow measurement). In
other embodiments, groove 118 can be additionally machined so as to avoid obstructing or
otherwise interfering with fluid and/or air bubble flow into and/or through venting channel
148. Second side 194 of dentin sample 190 is placed on first washer 182. Washer 184 is
placed on first side 192 of dentin sample 190. To complete sealing of the cell, lid 150 is
fastened onto bottom component 110, using fasteners 186. In the exemplified embodiment,
the fasteners 186 are screws which pass through optional fastener through-holes 175 of lid
150 and are anchored in/by fastener blind holes 135 of bottom component 110 having screw
holes suitable for engaging the screws so that the screws adjustably tighten and seal the lid
150 on to bottom component 110. The flow cell, including lid 150 and bottom component
110 is referred to as flow cell 100. Fasteners 186 may be formed of materials such as
stainless steel. Fastener through-holes 175 and fastener blind holes 135 are machined to fit
and engage fasteners 186.
         Alternatively, the assembly of lid 150 on to bottom component 110 can be
accomplished by the use of other adjustable fastening mechanisms, such as nails, dowels,
                                                 17

clamps, straps, bolts (e.g., screw-type), or any other fastening mechanism suitable for
providing a leak proof (or substantially leak proof) seal and allow for ready disassembly and
assembly. Optionally, the fastening mechanism can operate by friction or interference fit so
long as the friction or interference fit can withstand the fluid pressures necessary for
practicing the present invention.
         The "washers" 182 and 184 of the present invention are have at least one flat side for
contacting a dentin sample, optionally the washers are square washers or washers having at
least one pair of flat sides, one flat side opposite (or substantially opposite) the other flat side
of the pair, such that one flat side of the pair contacts the lid 150 and/or the base and the other
flat side of the pair is positioned to contact a dentin sample for securing the dentin sample
within the flow cell as illustrated in FIG. 8. In one embodiment, washers 182 and 184 of the
present invention are "0" rings with square cross-sections as shown in FIG. 9a. First side
(182' and 184') and second side (182" and 184") of washers 182 and 184 are flat.
         Embodiments of washers useful in the present invention include, but are not limited
to, such examples as shown in FIGs. 9a to 9g. FIG. 9a shows washer cross-sections 182a and
184a of a rectangular "0" ring. First side (182a' and 184a') and second side (182a" and
184a") of washer cross-sections 182a and 184a are flat. Washer cross-sections 182b and
184b of hexagonal "0" ring are shown in FIG.9b. First side (182b' and 184b') and second
side (182b" and 184b") of washer cross-sections 182b and 184b are flat. In FIG. 9c, washer
cross-sections 182c and 184c of trapezoidal "0" ring. First side (182c' and 184c') and
second side (182c" and 184c") of washer cross-sections 182c and 184c are flat. Washer
cross-sections 182d and 184d of rounded rectangular "0" ring are shown in FIG.9d. First
side (182d' and 184d') and second side (182d" and 184d") of washer cross-sections 182d
and 184d are flat. In FIG. 9e, washer cross-sections 182e and 184e of race-track shaped "0"
ring. First side (182e' and 184e') and second side (182e" and 184e") of washer cross
sections 182e and 184e are flat. FIG. 9f shows washer cross-sections 182f and 184f of a
single flat-sided "0" ring variant. Sides (182f" and 184f") of washer cross-sections 182f
and 184f are flat. FIG. 9g shows washer cross-sections 182g and 184g of a single flat-sided
"0" ring variant. Sides (182g" and 184g") of washer cross-sections 182g and 184g are flat.
It should be understood that the shape of the cross-sections of washers 182 and 184 need not
be the same, but may be independently different in shape such that washer182 may have, for
example, the cross-sectional shape illustrated at FIG. 9c and washer 184 may have the cross
sectional shape illustrated at FIG. 9g.

        Washers 182 and 184 may be made of, silicon, rubber or soft plastic. Examples of
such silicon, rubber or soft plastic materials, include, but are not limited to, butadiene rubber,
butyl rubber, chlorosulfonated polyethylene, epichiorohydrin rubber, ethylene propylene
diene monomer, ethylene propylene rubber, fluoroelastomer, nitrile rubber,
perfluoroelastomer, polyacrylate rubber, polychloroprene, polyisoprene, polysulfide rubber,
sanifluor, silicone rubber and styrene butadiene rubber) and thermoplastics (including, but
not limited to, thermoplastic elastomer; thermoplastic polyolefin, thermoplastic polyurethane,
thermoplastic etheresterelastomers, thermoplastic polyamide(s), melt processible rubber
thermoplastic vulcanizate) and mixtures thereof In one embodiment, the washers may be
rubber "O"-rings supplied by McMaster-Carr (Catalogue #4061T114) of Robbinsville, NJ.
        The permeability of dentin sample 190 is measured using flow cell 100 in the present
invention in the following manner. Once the two-part flow cell 100 is assembled, pressure is
used to initiate and maintain fluid (e.g., distilled water) flow in inlet channel 144, optionally
via 1 secondary inlet channel 142. In the case Fig. 8, fluid flows from optional secondary
inlet channel 142 into inlet channel 144, and into the portion of inner chamber 130 of bottom
component 110 below dentin sample 190. Initially, venting channel 148 (and optional
secondary venting channel 146), are kept open so that residual air in the form of air bubble(s)
located in the portion of inner chamber 130 below dentin sample 190 flows into venting
channel 148 and exits flow cell 100 (in some embodiments, through optional secondary
channel 146). When the residual air has been removed, venting channel 148 (and/or optional
secondary venting channel 146) is closed. When venting channel 148 (and/or optional
secondary venting channel 146) is closed, fluid pressure rises in the portion of inner chamber
130 below dentin sample 190. This increased fluid pressure initiates fluid flow in (across or
through) the dentin tubule orifices in dentin sample 190. Fluid flow continues through flow
outlet channel 160 of lid 150.
        Without being limited by any of the enumerated theories, it is believed that the
limitations of the Pashley cell are addressed by flow cell 100 of the present invention as
follows. The stacking error found in the Pashley flow cell due to the excessive number of
"O"-rings (four) and spacers (two) is eliminated by, in some embodiments, requiring no more
than two washers in the flow cell 100. Also, by requiring grooves 118 and 158, flow cell 100
reduces, substantially eliminates or eliminates leaks around the dentin sample caused by
sliding or inaccurate placement of the "O"-rings when assembling the Pashley cell.
                                                  19

         Next, the washers used in flow cell 100 of the present invention have at least one flat
side for contacting a dentin sample, optionally the washers have square cross-sections or at
least one pair of flat sides, one flat side opposite (or substantially opposite) the other flat side
of the pair, such that one flat side of the pair contacts the lid 150 and/or the base and the other
flat side of the pair is positioned to contact a dentin sample for securing the dentin sample
within the flow cell, whereas the "O"-rings used with the Pashley flow cell have round cross
sections. The oppositely situated flat side pairs of the washers of the present invention
contact the dentin sample over a consistent area of the dentin sample, minimizing possible
leaks in the system. Such washers also eliminate the inability to consistently determine the
area of the dentin sample exposed to the fluid in the flow cell caused by varying width of the
area of the sample/"O" ring contact line due to the flattening out of the round cross-section of
the Pashley type "O"-rings when pressure is exerted during sealing of the Pashley cell. As a
reminder, the inability to consistently determine the area of the dentin sample exposed to the
fluid in the Pashley flow cell may result in an inconsistent measurement of permeability
through the dentin when using the Pashley flow cell.
         Another issue with the Pashley flow cell relates to the assembly of the Pashley flow
cell, lid component 50 is screwed onto base component 10. The rotational movement of the
lid component 50 with respect to the base component 10 often causes rotation of the dentin
sample, the "O"-rings and the spacers, which can result in leaks around the dentin sample. In
flow cell 100, leaks around dentin sample 190 are minimized by fastening lid 150 onto
bottom component 110 using at least one press seal (i.e., a seal accomplished without
rotational movement of the lid 150 relative to the bottom component 110) fastener 186.
         Yet another issue with the Pashley flow cell relates to its "press-fit" connections from
inlet and outlet tubes to the inlet 22 and outlet 24 channels. The "press-fit" connections often
leak, resulting in inaccuracies in flow rate measurements. In certain embodiments, at least
one of inlet channel 144; optional secondary flow inlet channel 142; venting channel 148 and
optional secondary venting channel 146 used in flow cell 100 of the present invention have
"threaded" connections to inlet and outlet tubes. Specifically, in some embodiments, at least
one of inlet channel 144; optional secondary inlet channel 142; venting channel 148; and
optional secondary venting channel 146 are machined so as to have "threaded" connections to
inlet and outlet tubes via female or otherwise compatible treaded tube ends or adapters, such
as those available from Upchurch - IDEX health and Science, Bristol, CT or Swagelok, Solon
OH, and may be composed of metals such as stainless steel, polymers, or other non-reactive
materials.
                                                  20

        The Pashley method further fails to address the issue of air bubbles which tend to
aggregate under the dentin samples in flow cells during dentin permeability measurements.
Again, without being limited by theory in any of the following, it is believed that removal (or
reduction) of air bubbles from below dentin sample 190 in inventive flow cell 100 is
accomplished by positioning (e.g., by rotating or tilting ) the cell such that the angled (by the
angle 0) venting channel 148 forms a negative angle p relative to a top side of a horizontal
cross-sectional plane X"Y" through the flow cell 100 due to the positioning, the horizontal
cross-sectional plane X"Y" intersecting the inner end 148a of venting channel 148 and angle
 p having its vertex at the point of intersection of the inner end 148a and the horizontal cross
sectional plane X"Y". Angle p, as measured from the top side of the horizontal cross
sectional plane X"Y" clockwise (as illustrated at FIG. 10), ranges from greater than about
00, optionally from about 15' to about 85', optionally from about 25' to about 550, or
optionally from about 30' to about 45'. As illustrated in FIG. 10, rotating or tilting the flow
cell 100 clockwise (as illustrated by directional arrow "r") until venting channel 148 forms
the described angle p of greater than about 0' permits removal of air in the form of air
bubble(s) 136. The lower density (relative to the fluid) air bubbles 136 (with directional
arrows) flow in a vertical (or substantially vertical) direction (i.e., moving positively with
respect to the illustrated z" axis) out from inner chamber 130, through venting channel 148
and optional secondary venting channel 146, and, then, out of the flow cell 100. (For
purposes of illustrating angle p, FIG. 10 shows the cross-sectional plane X"Y"
perpendicular to, and coming out of the paper along the axis x".)
        FIG. 11 is a schematic flow chart drawing, explaining the equipment lay-out for use in
the method of measuring the permeability of dentin according to the current invention. The
figure shows flow cell 100, as a "black box" in the schematic drawing. Though this is one
possible lay-out of for the equipment, it is to be understood that other possible lay-outs would
also be useful in the method of measuring the permeability of dentin according to the current
invention.
        The schematic flow chart drawing includes, in flow communication: pressure
generating tank 220; fluid source 230; flow meter 242; pressure regulator 224; pressure
gauges 226 and 248; tubes 222, 234, 238, and 254; and valves 228, 236, 246, and 256. Tube
222 connects pressure generating tank 220 to fluid source 230. A fluid source 230 is
provided having a vessel (or container) with a cross-sectional area large enough to prevent a
detectable change in fluid level height from loss of fluid to the system apparatus. For
                                                 21

example a liter vessel having a cross-sectional diameter of 10cm could be used where the loss
of fluid from the container during the measurement would about 0.5 ml, The vessel (or
container) of fluid source 230 is filled with sufficient fluid 232 to define a fluid level plane
perpendicular to the vessel (or container) wall. The fluid source 230 is positioned at a height
Ah (i.e., the distance from the top of fluid level in the fluid source vessel to the top of the
dentin sample in the flow cell 100). In certain embodiments, the Ah is chosen to provide a
pressure (as determine by the static fluid pressure formula) comparable to pulpal pressure,
namely from about 0.2 psi ± 0.05 psi. The static fluid pressure formula is pgh, where p =
m/V   =  fluid density, g = acceleration of gravity, and h (or, in the present case, Ali) = depth of
fluid
         Fluid source 230 could be plastic, metal or glass. For example, fluid source 230 could
be a one-liter media bottle supplied by Kimble Chase Life Science and Research Products
LLC, Vineland, NJ, with a GL-45 Q-type Bottle cap 3way %-28 fitting ports (Fisher
Scientific # 00945Q-3). Fluid 232 may be water, distilled water, or de-ionized water (DI).
         Pressurized inert gas flows from pressure generating tank 220 through valve 228,
pressure regulator 224 and pressure gauge 226, and into the headspace above fluid 232 in
fluid source 230. Tube 234 and valve 236 are located on and, as earlier noted, in flow
communication with fluid source 230, and are used for venting fluid source 230, if necessary.
         The pressurization of fluid source 230 by pressure generating tank 220 acting as a
pumping mechanism (or source of pressure) for pumping fluid into flow cell 100. Other
pumping mechanisms (or sources of pressure) include, but are not limited to, static fluid
pressure, piston pumps, rotary piston pumps, diaphragm pumps, gear pumps, or double-action
piston pumps.
         The pressurization of fluid source 230 causes fluid 232 to exit fluid source 230
through tube 238. The fluid in tube 238 passes through flow meter 242, valve 246, and
pressure gauge 248, and enters flow cell 100 through flow inlet channel 144 (or, optionally
via secondary flow inlet channel 142) (see FIG 8). Tube 254 is connected to and, as earlier
noted, in flow communication with venting channel 148 (or, optionally via secondary vent
channel 146 (see FIG 8) of flow cell 100. Valve 256 is located on tube 254 to bleed residual
air (or, air bubbles 136) located in the portion of inner chamber 130 below dentin sample 190
at the start of a dentin permeability measurement. Fluid exits flow cell 100 via through flow
outlet channel 160 of lid 150 as shown by 252 in FIG. 11.
         In one embodiment, the pressure generating tank 220 shown in the schematic drawing
of FIG. 11 is a pressurized tank capable of providing a pressure in the apparatus, such as by
                                                  22

stand alone laboratory tanks or air compressor. In certain embodiments, the pressure
generating tank 220 provides pressure of up to 2000 psi. Such pressure generating tanks can
be obtained from a number of known suppliers. Purified air could be used, as could be inert
gases such as nitrogen or argon. In one embodiment, pressure generating tank 220 using
nitrogen gas, either "high purity" or "ultra high purity" can be obtained from Air Gas,
Radnor, PA. An example of a pressure generating tank suitable for use in the present
invention includes the N2 Cylinder HP300 supplied by Air Gas, Radnor, PA. Optionally, the
gas may be supplied from "house lines" external to the testing location, provided the pressure
from the "house lines" is sufficient to perform the disclosed permeability test.
        Pressure regulator 224 is an adjustable high precision regulator. As used herein, a
"high precision regulator" means a regulator capable of maintaining a pressure of less than or
equal to 30 psi (or about 30 psi), optionally less than or equal to 20 psi (or about 20 psi),
optionally less than or equal to 15 psi (or about 15 psi), optionally less than or equal to 10 psi
(or about 10 psi), optionally less than or equal to 5 psi (or about 5 psi), optionally less than or
equal to 2.5 psi (or about 2.5 psi) and optionally from about 0.00 1 psi, optionally 0.01 psi (or
about 0.01 psi), optionally 0.1 psi (or about 0.1 psi), optionally 0.25 psi (or about 0.25 psi), or
optionally 0.5 psi (or about 0.5 psi), in all cases, without fluctuations, for a period of at least
10 minutes, optionally 15 minutes, optionally 30 minutes, or optionally 60 minutes. The term
"fluctuation(s)" as used herein means measurement variation(s) of greater than or equal to ±
0.1 psi (or about 0.1psi), optionally greater than or equal to ± 0.01 psi (or about ± 0.01 psi),
optionally greater than or equal to ± 0.005 psi (or about 0.005 psi), or optionally greater than
or equal to ± 0.001 psi (or about 0.001 psi). In certain embodiments, the high precision
regulator provides a pressure in the apparatus such that the fluid flow rate in the apparatus
ranges from 0 (or about 0) to about 200, optionally from about 0 (or about 0) 0 (or about 0) to
about 85, or optionally from about 0 (or about 0) to about 20 micro-liter/minute. An example
of a high precision regulator suitable for use in the present invention is the Type-I OLR
pressure regulator supplied by Marsh Bellofram (Newell, WV). Pressure gauges 226 and 248
may, in some embodiments, may be precision digital test gauges such as Types 2089, 2086,
and 2084 supplied by Ashcroft (Huntington Beach, CA). Optionally, the apparatus of the
present invention can employ at least two pressure regulators, a first gross pressure regulator
capable of maintaining a pressure for a given or certain period of time and a second high
precision pressure regulator capable of maintaining a pressure of less than or equal to 20 psi
(or about 20 psi), optionally less than or equal to 15 psi (or about 15 psi), optionally less than
or equal to 10 psi (or about 10 psi), optionally less than or equal to 5 psi (or about 5 psi), or
                                                 23

optionally less than or equal to 2.5 psi (or about 2.5 psi), without fluctuations, for a period of
at least 10 minutes, optionally 15 minutes, optionally 30 minutes, or optionally 60 minutes.
         In one embodiment, the flow rate meter 242 is a high precision flow meter. When
used to describe the flow rate meter, the phrase "high precision" means a flow meter having
an instrument resolution of below about 0.5 microliter per minute, or optionally below about
0.5 nanoliters. The flow meter can be a manual or digital flow meter. Flow meter 242 acts as
a measuring device suitable for measuring and/or determining hydraulic conductance through
dentin sample 190. In certain embodiments, the flow rate meter is calibrated to measure fluid
flow rates of from about 0 to about 200, optionally from about 0 to about 85, or optionally
from about 0 to about 20 microliter/minute. Examples of manual flow rate meters that can be
used include those supplied by Gilmont Instruments (Barrington, IL), including the direct
reading flowmeter Gilmont Flowmeter GF2000 and the correlated flowmeter Gilmont
Flowmeter GF3000. Examples of digital flow rate meters that can be used include the
Sensirion SLG1430-025 flowmeter supplied by The Sensirion Co. (Westlake Village, CA)
and such flow meters supplied by Bronkhorst High-Tech (Bethlehem, PA) as the thermal
liquid mass flowmeter Micro-FLOW series LO1 Digital Mass Flow Meter. In some
embodiments, a second flow rate meter may be used with flow rate meter 242 to confirm that
the fluid flow rate in the system of the present invention falls within the range that flow rate
meter 242 is calibrated to measure (as described above). In other embodiments, one flow rate
meter (manual) could be used to verify the more accurate reading of a second, digital flow
rate meter.
         Tubes 222, 234, 238, and 254, may be metal or plastic. In one embodiment, the tubes
are Tube Tefzel (Natural 1/16 x .040 x 50ft), available from Upchurch - IDEX health and
Science, Bristol, CT. Valves 228, 236, 246, and 256 are used to control flow through the test
apparatus, or to isolate sections of the test apparatus. The valves must be sized to fit with the
rest of the test apparatus. In one embodiment, the valves are 2-Way Valve Bio with 1/8in
Fittings, available from Upchurch - IDEX health and Science, Bristol, CT.
         Because the permeability flow cell and hydraulic conductance system of the present
invention addresses the inaccuracies and potential sources of leakage associated with the
Pashley cell, it generally takes less than 5 (or about 5) minutes, optionally, less than 4 (or
about 4) minutes, optionally, less than 3 (or about 3) minutes, or optionally less than 2 (or
about 2) minutes for the apparatus' system to achieve stability of measurement. The phrase
"stability of measurement", as used herein, means substantially no fluctuation in the fluid
flow rate measurement readings, namely, no fluctuations in the fluid flow rate measurement
                                                 24

readings of less than or equal to ± 0.0 10 grams per hour, optionally less than or equal to
0.005 grams per hour, or optionally less than or equal to ± 0.001 grams per hour.
         The present invention will be better understood from a consideration of the following
illustrative examples.
                                          EXAMPLES
         The following examples are illustrative only and should not be construed as limiting
the invention in any way. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that variations are possible
which are within the spirit and scope of the appended claims.
                                            Example 1
         An in vitro study suing prepared dentin samples to evaluate treatment with
formulations containing varying amounts of potassium oxalate (KO) as shown in Table 1.
         Human dentin samples from molar teeth are used in the study. The samples are cut
from the crown resulting in about one to three samples per tooth, each having a diameter of
10.7 ±0.5 mm and a thickness of 0.54 +/- 0.05mm. The above cutting process leaves behind
a smear layer on each surface of the dentin sample. The smear layer is removed by etching
each dentin sample with 6% citric acid for 3 minutes in conjunction with sonication
(sonications in this Example 1 and Example 2 were performed using a SharperTek CD-4800
ultrasonic cleaner supplied by Sharpertek USA [Pontiac, MI]). After etching, the dentin
samples are again sonicated as described above in di-H 2 0 for 1.5 minutes to thoroughly clean
the sample. The dentin samples, as described above, exhibit magnification properties when
viewing through one side of the dentin sample and demagnification when viewing through
the other side. The samples are stored in vials, magnification side facing upward, with a
moistened towelette (i.e., Kimwipe with di-H 20) within the capped vial to prevent the
dehydration of the samples.
     A. The system layout of Fig. 11 is prepared and primed for use in the permeation study
         as follows:
       Al. The following system units are turned on:
              " pressure generating tank 220;
              " flow meter (digital) 242; and
              " pressure gauges 226 and 248;
                                                25

  A2. Vent valve 236 is opened,
  A3. The dentin sample 190 is placed in flow cell 100, verifying that magnification side is
        facing upwards. The flow cell 100 is made of an optically clear material (i.e., clear
        acrylic),
  A4. A syringe is filled with di-H20 (DI) and connected to the flow cell inlet 144, the DI
        is present in the syringe at a volume equal to at least two times the volume of the
        fluid cell 100,
  A5. System valve 256 is opened to permit fluid introduced from the syringe to flow out,
  A6. Flow cell 100 is rotated about 450, moving venting channel 148 upwards and inlet
        channel 144 downwards; The syringe is pressed in pulses to provide a fluid flow
        into the cell 100,
  A7. The syringe is pressed in pulses to provide a fluid flow into the cell 100,
  A8. Cell is rotated to view the bottom (i.e., demagnification side) of the dentin sample to
        verify the presence or absence of air bubbles;
  A9. Steps A7 and A8 are repeated until no air bubbles are present;
  A10. Once all air bubbles are removed, system valve 256 is closed and syringe is
        removed.
  Al 1. Cell 100 is connected via tubing 238 in flow communication with valve 246 and
        valve 246 is opened, (steps A3 to Al 1 take less than about 1 to 2 minutes). (When
        using the flow cell of the present invention, steps A3 to Al 1 should generally take
        no more than 5 minutes, optionally less than 3 minutes, optionally less than 2
        minutes, optionally less than minutee)
  A12. If the fluid flow (as measured by flow meter 242) is below about 15 microliter/min,
        under the head-pressure due to gravity (from Ah), valve 228 is opened providing
        pressure from pressure generating tank 220 for about 5-10 seconds and then valve
        236 is closed,
  A13. Once valve 236 is closed, the pressure is adjusted via pressure regulator 224 to
        establish about 15 microliter/min fluid flow rate,
  A14. Once stable 15 microliter/min fluid flow rate is established, close valve 246,
  A15. The top surface of dentin sample 190 is dried with Kimwipe (or pipette) through
        flow outlet channel 160; preparing for commencement of Treatment Protocol
B. Treatment Protocol: A formulation of Table A is applied to the dentin sample of step
   A (above) as follows:
                                            26

       Bl. 200 microliters of the formulation is applied to dentin sample 190 using a pipette, and
            is left on the dentin sample for about 1 minute,
       B2. The formulation is, then, removed (or, taken up) from the dentin sample using a
            Kimwipe (or pipette), then 200 microliters of deionized (D.I.) water is applied onto
            dentin sample 190 using a pipette, and is left on the dentin sample for about 1
            minute,
       B3. The DI water is, then, removed using a Kimwipe (or pipette),
       B4. Steps BI through B3 are, then, repeated two additional times.
    C. The permeation study with treated dentin sample 190 is performed using the pre
        prepared/primed system of part A as follows (i.e.,):
       C1. Following steps of part A, system valve 246 is opened to start fluid flow;
       C2. The system is permitted to run for about 5 minutes to reach equilibrium for
            experimental fluid flow rate reading from fluid flow meter 242, and
       C3. System valve 246 is turned off.
    D. Treatment Protocol (Steps BI to B4) and Permeation Study (Steps C1 to C3) are
        repeated for each formulation in Table 1 until the earliest of: i) the flow rates of all 15
        treatments are measured (i.e., mimicking about 1 week of use); or ii) no flow rate is
        observed through the dentin sample.
        The data is normalized by calculating the residual permeability (RP). The RP of
dentin sample after a treatment is calculated as follows:
                                        Flow Ratex
                              RPx   =  -----------------
                                        Flow Rateo
where: Flow Ratex is the measured flow rate after each of x treatments (0 to n), where n is the
total number of treatments, and Flow Rateo is the measured flow rate prior to any treatment.
        Though typically presented in terms of RP, this step may be omitted when using the
apparatus (including flow cell) and methods of the present invention in view of present
invention's ability to standardize flow rates (e.g, at 15 microliters/min) across each dentin
sample.

                 The table shows that as the number of treatments increases, the residual permeability
        (or, permeability of the dentin samples) decreases for all KO containing formulations. In
        addition, as the KO percent in the treatment formulation increases, the rate of decrease of the
        residual permeability increases. The reduction of residual permeability of dentin after
                                                              28

treatments corresponds to occlusion efficacy of treatment technology. The residual
permeability may be plotted as a function of treatments and compared against control / other
formulations. The results further indicate that the high throughput apparatus and methods of
the present invention do not compromise integrity of the generated data.
                                             Example 2
         The versatility of the high throughput apparatus (including the flow cell) and methods
of the present invention is further illustrated by its use in the treatment "challenge" procedure
described below. The time period from the removal of the dentin sample from the inventive
flow cell to obtaining reliable flow rate data (after reincorporation of the dentin sample into
the inventive flow cell and apparatus according to the procedure outlined below) can be less
than 5 minutes, optionally 3 minutes, optionally 2 minutes, or optionally 1 minute. The
reliability of the flow rate data results from the dependability, reliability and predictability of
the setup and the performance of the apparatus (including the flow cell) of the present
invention, coupled with the recognition that data integrity is not compromised.
Treatment Challenge Procedure
         The treatment technologies applied to dentin samples (e.g., the formulations of Table
1) can be challenged (i.e., brushing, acid, sonication etc., alone or in combination) and, then,
evaluated using the flow cell, apparatus and methods of the present invention using the
following procedure:
E. Performing step Al through D of Example 1, followed by:
   El. The top of flow cell 100 is removed from the bottom component of flow cell,
    E2. The washer location on the dentin sample is marked, (this step can also be performed
    after step A3 in Example 1).
    E3. The dentin sample is removed from the flow cell 100,
    E4. The dentin sample is challenged by placing dentin sample into a vial of
         hydrodroxylapatite saturated lactic acid (~pH    = 5.0) and sonicated for about 90
         seconds,
   E5. The dentin sample is rinsed in a pool of DI,
   E6. Steps A3 through Al 1 of Example 1 are performed to prime (i.e., remove air bubbles)
         the flow cell 100 and reestablish conductivity of apparatus system,
   E7. The fluid flow rate is then obtained from flow rate meter 242.
                                                 29

The time period from the removal of the dentin sample from the flow cell to obtaining flow
rate measurement data takes less than 2 minutes and, in some cases, less than 1 minute.
