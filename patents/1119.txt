                                        ABSTRACT
In order to effect a seal a porous material which comprises one side of two opposing
surfaces is used to restrict and evenly distribute externally pressurized gas, liquid,
steam, etc. between the two surfaces, exerting a force which is opposite the forces
from pressure differences or springs trying to close the two faces together and so
may create a non-contact seal that is more stable and reliable than hydrodynamic
seals currently in use. A non-contact bearing is also disclosed having opposing
surfaces with relative motion and one surface issuing higher than ambient
pressure through a porous restriction, wherein the porous restriction is part of a
monolithic porous body, or a porous layer, attached to lands containing a
labyrinth, the porous restriction and lands configured to not distort more than 10%
of a gap created from differential pressure between each side of the porous
restriction.

[0003]        This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Patent Application
Serial No. 13/733,806, filed on January 3, 2013 which claims the benefit of U.S.

[0004]                          FIELD OF INVENTION
[0005]        This application is generally related to bearings and seals used in
pumps, compressors, turbines, generators, motors, turbo expanders and chargers,
mixers, thrusters, propulsors, in-line pumps, refiners etc., that are used in the oil
and gas, power generation e.g., compressed air and pumped hydro storage, aero
turbine,   chemical    processing,  paper   manufacturing,    aeration  and    water
purification, gas separation, and various other process fields.
[0006]                              BACKGROUND
[0007]        Turbo equipment typically includes a rotating shaft with impellers or
blades that are borne by a radial bearing at either end of the rotating shaft. A
thrust bearing is employed at one end of the shaft in order to accommodate axial
loading of the rotating shaft assembly.
[0008]        Typically dry gas or mechanical seals are used ensure that bearing
oil lubrication is not mixed with process fluid and to contain high pressure gases
from escaping. Dry gas seals use hydrodynamic air bearing affects to create small,
non-contact gaps. These non-contact gaps are effective as sealants only when the
surface speed between the sealing surfaces is relatively high and the bearing
surfaces remain flat and pressed against each other to prevent seizure at speed
and/or "Hang-ups." Mechanical seals suffer from similar issues.
                                           -1-

[0009]        In contact based seals, areas of the shaft and seal are subject to wear
and leakage and create a lot of noise e.g., lip seals. Brush and ablatable seals are
a form of contact based seals that use centrifugal force or pressure differentials to
keep them in contact with a respective mating surface. General wear on brush and
ablatable seals create particulates that add significantly to maintenance costs; at
high speeds, heat and frictional losses between the seals and shaft are significant.
Labyrinth seals provide a form of non-contact seal that minimizes wear on the
shaft caused by contact, but these non-contact seals provide a conductance path
that can result in huge flows when there are pressure differentials across the seal.
Leakages in non-contact seals are reduced by minimizing and elongating
clearances in an axial direction between the rotating and stationary sections of the
seal. This adds significant costs and is not always effective. In process equipment,
bearing isolators are used to combine labyrinth and lip seal technologies. These
isolators inject fluid or gas at a higher pressure than the flow pressure of the
volume to be sealed, as seen in U.S. Patent No. 7,631,878 (Orlowski).
[0010]        In Turbo equipment, hydrodynamic oil bearings, such as spiral
groove and foil bearing, are typically configured as either a sleeve or tilting pad to
accommodate rotary loads or a tilting pad-type bearing to accommodate thrust
loads. The bearings may be mounted in various configurations, such as, for
example: stud mounting, where a rounded or spherical surface mates with a
backside of a bearing pad, See, New Way Air Bearings' web site under "mounting
components"; flexure mounting, where a bearing pad moves freely in various
directions as a result of being mounted upon a compliant member e.g., a flexure or
groove, See generally, U.S. Patent No. 5,743,654 (Ide); elastomeric mounting,
where a bearing pad has compliance from contact with an elastomeric member
e.g., an O-ring type mount, See generally, U.S. Patent No. 3,360,309 (Voorhis); a
spring-type mounting that provides compliance to the bearing pad, e.g., Belleville
washers; and any other suitable mount, such as, linkages, hardened balls, rods,
pins, etc.
                                           -2-

[0011]         The hydrodynamic oil bearings provide non-contact seals, such as gas
and labyrinth seals, based on the viscous dragging of a fluid or gas into a small
gap. The oil bearings build up a pressure "wedge" as certain speeds are reached.
See generally, Pall Corporation and Carbone Turbograph gas seals; U.S.
Publication No. 2006/0062499 Al (carbon graphite, ceramic materials, pressurized
gas in high-speed turbine engines). Typically small electric motor compressors e.g.,
oil-free   positive  displacement    compressors,    pneumatically-driven    positive
displacement compressors, or multi-stage centrifugal compressors, that are direct
driven, high speed, and constructed with stainless steel and without internal seals
or oil lubrication systems, are used in the industry to provide air and a relatively
small amount of seal gas at a relatively high pressure. It is important to remove
particulates and condensates prior to injecting gas into an externally pressurized
gas bearing; air quality Class 3 as defined by ISO 8573-1 is recommended for use
in externally-pressurized gas bearings. See generally, Almasi, Turbomachinery
International Nov/Dec 2013 issue. Use of conventional sealing systems that
combine labyrinth and face/dry-gas seal technologies facilitate low flows from the
small gaps positioned between the technologies. The buffer/flush gas provided in
the small gap flows to a process side through the labyrinth. Similarly, a seal gas
is provided that flows to a process side. The seal gas may be vented or flared. Some
separation gas vents through a bearing chamber with a pumped-oil input.
Temperature fluctuations in the bearing chamber cause large changes in oil
viscosity and oil leakage from turbo systems creating serious problems; drains and
coolers are used to control oil temperature.

[0012]                                 SUMMARY
[0013]         Briefly stated, the invention in one aspect provides a porous
externally pressurized gas bearing technology for use as a seal in Turbo equipment
e.g., turbines, pumps, centrifugal and axial compressors, expanders, blowers,
dryers, high speed motors, etc., that eliminates the need for oil-based bearings and
improves efficiency in large equipment by combining sealing and bearing
functions. The combination of sealing and bearing functions in Turbo equipment
has implications for length, stiffness, and dynamic performance of rotating
equipment. These pressurized gas bearings are non-contact bearings that: operate
independent of relative motion, e.g., zero RMP; operate at extreme temperatures,
e.g., in cryogenic or superheated steam applications; operate while using highly
pressurized process gas or fluid in a non-contact bearing gap; combine sealing and
bearing functionality to prevent or reduce wear and pressure between contacting
faces; prevent "hang-ups" that result from failure of a compliance or biasing
mechanism; increase rotordynamic stability. As non-contact seals, these gas
bearings have no coulomb friction and no wear. There is viscous sheer friction in
the air film but this is orders of magnitude less than the bearing friction. The
structure and functionality of the gas bearings results in reduced maintenance
and weight of the overall system, eliminates dry-running at start-up, extends the
life of the bearings, allows the bearing system to operate aerodynamically should
the gas supply be interrupted (magnetic bearings require a back-up bearing in the
event of a power interruption), and results in reduced energy consumption and an
environmentally-friendly solution to oil bearings.
[0014]         The pressurized gas bearing uses a porous media to restrict and
evenly distribute the flow of externally supplied hydrostatic pressure into an air
bearing gap by exerting a force that is opposite the forces from the pressure
differences or springs being used to bias the bearing faces together. The porous
media externally pressurized gas bearing is able to run on process fluid and the
                                           -4-

porosity can be adjusted to restrict the flow of pressurized gas in the gas bearing
to the molecular weight and/or viscosity of the gases to be used in the Turbo
equipment. The porous media may be bonded to a nonporous housing with an air
distribution labyrinth that leads into the porous media.
[0015]         The air bearing gap is located between at least two opposing seals or
counter surfaces and maintains the high pressure in the air bearing gap to seal
against migration of contamination, liquids, and gases and separates atmospheric
pressure from a vacuum used to preload the air film in lightly loaded precision
stages. Even though the pressurized gas bearing is a non-contact system, the seals
are mechanically coupled to a respective counter bearing surface via compression
of the air film and the flow through the porous media is determined by a desired
flow through the air gap, generally approximately two times the desired flow with
the shaft or thrust in place.
[0016]          The aerostatic pressure of the bearing system may be adjusted to the
point where the bearing faces are completely unloaded and zero contact pressure
exists between the bearing faces even though the bearing faces are in intimate
contact. Contact between the bearing faces results in approximately zero flow
through the air gap and the line pressure being fed into the porous material will
exist between the bearing faces.      This contact force can easily be adjusted by
varying the input pressure to reduce wear and heat generated by friction in
conventional contact seals and by increasing the air gap thickness during shaft
rotation to minimize temperature build-up through sheer energy losses. This
technology can be applied to radial bearings for rotating shafts, thrust bearings,
and also for use in sealing various surfaces of rotating components e.g., impellers,
etc.
[0017]         Unlike an orifice bearing that will collapse and close the air gap in
an overload condition, externally pressurized gas bearings that include porous
graphite bearing faces generate a mitigating force in an overload condition. This
occurs because the porous media does not depend on the air gap to distribute air
                                            -5-

pressure across the bearing face and the faces continue to exert air pressure across
the entire bearing are. This happens even in a zero gap or zero flow situations.
[0018]         Externally  pressurized     gas  bearings   have    the   potential  to
revolutionize the fundamental design of Turbo equipment. This is, in part, because
the pressurized gas bearings have the capability to operate with process gases,
carbon dioxide, nitrogen, helium, argon, other gases, or even steam, and at process
temperatures which allows the gas bearings to move from the ends of the shafts
to a position directly between the impellers or stages. Further, the gas bearings
may also be positioned and employed in places where work is being done in the
turbo equipment that were previously off-limits to bearing technology. This
substantially improves rotor dynamics since gas bearings on the impellers allow
for independently-rotating     stages and high-speed motors can be integrated
directly into each impeller stage; this eliminates the need for a rotating shaft, gear
boxes, elongation of shaft segments, and alignment issues between the compressor
and motor/driver. This is a substantial improvement over the prior art since each
impeller stage can be independently rotated at its most efficient speed for the
Turbo equipment as an overall bearing system. Further, externally pressurized
gas bearings allow for shorter shaft segments, higher speed-capability, larger
bearing journals, dramatic stiffening of the shaft, and additional squeeze-film
damping surface area which eliminates the need for the circulation and cooling of
oil and venting of gases to flare. Removing the possibility that oxygen will be
introduced into the flammable gases being compressed results in increased safety
for Turbo equipment operators and bystanders.
[0019]        Because externally pressurized gas bearings combine sealing and
bearing functionality, highly-effective seals are possible between impeller stages,
radially at the root on the shaft diameter, and/or axially at the perimeter of the
impellers. Axial bearings at the perimeter of a centrifugal stage can be fitted with
axial compliance and biasing forces. This provides both damping and compliance
for thermal growth. Most importantly, such bearing/seal combinations eliminate
                                            -6-

blow-by inefficiencies, avoiding the problems associated with large high pressure
flows through non-deterministic clearance gaps. Thin laminar flow gas-bearing
gaps seal between impeller stages in narrow bearing bands just inside an
impeller's outer diameter and large clearances          are left everywhere    else.
Consequently, use of the externally pressurized gas bearings results in noise
reduction and Turbo equipment that is more efficient.
[0020]        A non-contact bearing is also disclosed having opposing surfaces with
relative motion and one surface issuing higher than ambient pressure through a
porous restriction, wherein the porous restriction is part of a monolithic porous
body, or a porous layer, attached to lands containing a labyrinth, the porous
restriction and lands configured to not distort more than 10% of a gap created from
differential pressure between each side of the porous restriction.
[0020a]       In one aspect the present invention provides an assembly for
providing electrical contact between rotating and stationary components, the
assembly comprising:
              a brush comprised of a porous media member including a face which
contacts an opposing member; and
              a spring which applies a force against the brush,
              wherein the porous media member is an externally-pressurized
porous gas bearing with porous restriction, and is configured to receive adjustable
externally-pressurized gas which acts against the spring force such that the
external pressure multiplied by the contact area is less than the spring force,
resulting in an adjustable contact pressure between the brush and the opposing
member.

[0077]        DETAILED         DESCRIPTION           OF      THE       PREFERRED
EMBODIMENTS
[0078]        Certain terminology is used in the following description for
convenience only and is not limiting. The words "front," "back," "left," "right,"
"inner," "outer," "upper," "lower," "top," and "bottom" designate directions in the
drawings to which reference is made. Additionally, the terms "a" and "one" are
defined as including one or more of the referenced item unless specifically noted
otherwise. A reference to a list of items that are cited as "at least one of a, b, or c"
(where a, b, and c represent the items being listed) means any single one of the
items a, b, or c, or combinations thereof. The terminology includes the words
specifically noted above, derivatives thereof, and words of similar import.
                                           -10-

[0079]        As illustrated in FIGS. 1A and 2A, a shaft 101 that may rotate at
high speeds 201 is coupled to a runner 110, 214 via an O-ring 111, 211 or any other
suitable mounting mechanism. The shaft 101 may be equipped with a sleeve 112.
The O-ring 111, 211 provides axial compliance to the runner 110, 214 by
accommodating axial displacements of the shaft 101 and/or self-adjusting gaps
that occur between the runner 110, 214 and a stationary surface. The thickness of
the gap is a function of hydrostatic input pressure, the forces urging air bearing
faces 212 together, restrictions of porous media 107 and the ratio of surface area
to leak edge of the surfaces. These variables may be controlled to create highly
effective noncontact seals. In one embodiment, the runner 110, 214 is hard
mounted to the shaft 101 and axial compliance is designed into the stationary
components so that the runner 110, 214 is free to move radially on an air film. As
illustrated in FIGS. 1B and 2A, a spring loading mechanism 113 biases the runner
110, 214 or opposing air bearing faces 212 of at least two mechanical seals into
contact to adjust the load on the seal faces 212 and provide axial compliance.
[0080]        As illustrated in FIGS. 1A, 1B, and 2A, a seal body 109 is mounted
at an interface to a housing casing 203 or adapter plate 205 via an O-ring seal 105.
The seal body 109 is equipped with conductive passages 106 that supply
pressurized fluid to a labyrinth 108. The labyrinth 108 evenly distributes the
pressurized fluid to the backside of a porous media 107 comprised of any porous
or sintered material such as graphite, carbon, silicon carbide, Tungsten carbide,
alumina, etc. In an alternative embodiment, any air bearing compensation
technique may be used, such as, for example, orifice, step, groove, inherent or
pocketed compensation, etc.
[0081]        As illustrated in FIG. 1C, a shaft 151 for a piece of rotating
equipment, for example, a compressor or turbine, has a sleeve and rotating mating
ring 152 that cooperates with a primary ring 150. A compressor case 153 receives
a seal cartridge 159, shown by API standard 682. The seal cartridge 159 feeds
pressure to a porous face 154 of the primary ring 150. The primary ring 150 does
                                          -11-

not rotate and acts as "flexible element" that introduces pressure through a port
155 into a Plenum 157 which is sealed with O-rings 156. A spring 158 or
diaphragm type flexure acts as a biasing force and keeps the air bearing primary
ring 150 pressed against the rotating mating ring 152. In a tandem seal the same
description is repeated with regard to a secondary seal.
[0082]        As illustrated in FIG. 1D, a primary ring 169 with a porous face 160
and a Plenum 167 is contained inside the seal cartridge 159 by O-rings 162. A port
165 of the Plenum 167 distributes air pressure behind the porous face 160 to a
through port 168. A spring 166 or diaphragm type flexure acts as a biasing force
and keeps the primary ring 169 against the mating ring to avoid any potential
leakages. To prevent "hang ups" that occur when the compliant ring is not forced
against the mating ring and cause undesired back flows, the air pressure being
fed to the face 160 of the bearing may also be employed on the back of, in this case,
the primary ring 169.
[0083]        As illustrated in FIG. 1E, a primary ring 179 with a porous face 170
and a Plenum 171 that distributes air pressure behind the porous face 170 is
constrained between O-rings 172 within the seal cartridge. A port 178 supplies air
pressure from a bearing functionality to a port 175 before reaching Plenum 171. A
vent 173 isolates pressure meant for the air bearing face and exerts a force on the
back of the primary ring. In this way only the spring or diaphragm forces will urge
the primary ring towards the mating ring.
[0084]        As illustrated in FIG. 1F, a primary ring 189 with a porous face 180
and a Plenum 187 that distributes air pressure behind the porous face 181 is
constrained in the seal cartridge by an O-ring 182 and a Torus 183 e.g., a segment
of a sphere or a curve with constant diameter (See FIG 1G). The primary ring 189,
0-ring 182, and Torus 183 are tightly fitted inside of the seal cartridge diameter
184. A port 188 introduces air pressure to the bearing and supplies the pressure
to a port 185 though the Plenum 187. The Plenum 187 supplies the pressure to a
labyrinth 181 and the labyrinth 181 supplies the pressure to a porous media 180.

[0085]        As illustrated in FIG 2B, a shaft 221 for a piece of Turbo equipment
has a seal cartridge 222. A mating ring 223 that is a rotating flexible element is
provided within the seal cartridge 222. The mating ring 223, as shown in FIG. 2B,
is integrally associated with a sleeve. In one embodiment, the sleeve and mating
ring 223 may be separate components. The mating ring 223 and sleeve are
supported axially on the shaft 221 via springs 232 and the mating rings 223, 233
are locked together axially by clamping ring 237. In one preferred embodiment,
the mating ring 223 runs against a stationary primary ring 229 with a porous
bearing seal face 224 and a labyrinth 226 and input port 227 to create an effective
hydrostatic gap using the porous media 225 as a restrictive element. In this
embodiment, for example, for a double seal, a second mating ring 233 and a second
primary ring face 230 are positioned opposite from the porous bearing seal face
224 of the stationary primary ring 229. Both the single and double seal bearing
systems are fed external pressure and vented using the same systems and porting.
The volume between the porous bearing seal face 224 and the second primary ring
face 230 is vented though a port 228 to prevent pressure build-up in the volume
between the faces 224, 230. Seal faces 230, 231 are similarly vented. It should be
noted that some of the flow exiting the seal gap 224 will flow to the process side.
The amount is dependent on pressure difference between the pressurized volume
and the vent pressure. For example, if the volume 234 is pressurized to 1000 PSI
and the vent 228 is at ambient pressure flow most of the flow will be out of the
vent rather than into the process. The input pressure to the porous media 225
should be 4 to 6 bar above the pressure it is sealing against, for example, 1060 to
1090 PSI. It is possible to regulate a cascading lower pressure to each of the
successive faces so that the pressure is dropped down over stages. If each stage
has a 1000 PSI pressure drop, the seal could effectively seal 3000 PSI.
[0086]        The air bearing sealing gaps between the faces of the porous bearings
on the stationary primary ring 229 in the inside facing surfaces of mating rings
223, 233 is fixed at assembly. Axial displacement of the shaft relative to the seal
                                          -13-

cartridge allows the mating ring sleeve to move on the shaft during "hang-ups" of
the mating rings 223, 233 so that the bearing faces are not materially damaged.
In one embodiment, a porous carbon bearing face runs on the opposite side of the
mating ring 223 in the space 234 between the porous bearing seal face 224 and the
second primary ring face 230, as shown in illustration 600.
[0087]         As illustrated in FIG. 2C-1, a seal gas flows into a gap from an outside
edge 255 across the gap and exits at a lower pressure edge 256. The seal gas is
introduced into a port 253 at a higher pressure than a process gas. The runner 252
rotates at a high speed with the shaft 251. Aerodynamic features 254 etched into
the faces of the runner 252 establish an air bearing film on each side of the runner.
[0088]         As illustrated in FIG. 2C-2, an axial or angular change in the shaft
results in a smaller gap on one side 257 and larger gap on the other side 258. This
results in restricted flow of seal gas and reduced pressure to the side with the
smaller gap 257 causing instability.
[0089]         As illustrated in FIG. 2C-3, a high pressure gas is introduced through
a port 259 into a plenum 260. The plenum 260 supplies the high pressure gas to
the porous media 261 which restricts the flow of the high pressure gas into the
bearing gap 262. There are no features etched in the runner 263. The bearing
pressure in the gap at the runner 263 automatically increases when a similar axial
or angular change in the position of the runner 263 towards one of the bearing
faces occurs. The bearing pressure in the gap continues to increase until the
runner actually makes contact with one of the bearing faces at which point the
pressure attempting to exit the porous media will approach the input pressure.
The relative force between the runner and the bearing face is mitigated by the
pressure attempting to exit the bearing face at the runner 263. The opposite side
264 of the runner has a lower pressure since the gap is larger and the restriction
comes from the porous media instead of the edge of the gap. This results in a
naturally stable situation where the side with the smaller gap builds a higher
pressure and the side with the larger gap has a relatively lower pressure. In the
                                            -14-

aerodynamics seals illustrated in FIGS. 2C-1 and 2C-2 the reverse is the case.
[0090]        As illustrated in FIG. 2D, the stiffness of an air bearing film changes
with its thickness. The thickness of the air gap is directly correlated to its stiffness;
a thinner air gap increases the stiffness of the air bearing film. As illustrated in
the chart of FIG. 2D, the slope of the lift load curve is representative of the bearing
stiffness at a given point; the horizontal line represents zero stiffness and the
vertical line represents infinite stiffness. A decrease in the size of the gap makes
it increasingly difficult to distribute enough air across the full surface of the
bearing. In a porous bearing, the air issues from the entire face of the bearing
directly into the gap and there is no difficulty in getting the air to flow across the
gap. This makes the porous bearing a more robust gas bearing. It is worth noting
that the flow through the gap is a cubed function of the gap; doubling the gap
results in an eight fold increase in the flow.
[0091]        As illustrated in FIG. 3A, a shaft 301 that may rotate at high speeds
is rotated inside of a stationary cylindrical bearing seal 310. Contamination or
pressures that exist in a volume 308 are sealed and denied egress into a gap 309
by hydrostatic pressure exiting the gap 309. In one embodiment, the housing or
casing 311 is equipped to receive the cylindrical air bearing seal 310 directly. In
an alternative embodiment, the housing or casing 311 is equipped to receive an
adapter block 315 at an interface; an O-ring 313 provides a static seal at the
interface. In each of these embodiments, it is preferred to have a retainer 303 on
the low pressure side of the seal; clearance 302 should be provided between the
retainer 303 and the shaft. A passageway 306 supplies high pressure fluid to the
cylindrical seal assembly. In one embodiment, the O-rings 312 seal the plenum
307 so that the high pressure fluid may be supplied into the cylindrical air bearing
seal body 310 through a single passageway 306; the fluid is supplied into the seal
body 310 without directly connecting a fitting to the seal body 310. In another
embodiment, the O-rings 312 provide for radial and angular compliance so that
the shaft is free to move axially on an air film. The O-rings 312 may also be used
                                             -15-

to contain epoxy, injected through a hole 314, which fills a cylindrical gap 304
between the housing or mounting block and the seal body.
[0092]        The high pressure fluid entering through aperture 306 and finding
its way through the hole in the seal body will be distributed axially and radially
between the seal body 310 and the porous media 316 by a labyrinth 305 which may
be in the porous media or the seal body. Although porous media compensation is
the preferred embodiment other compensation methods are possible. Porous
media air bearing compensation is only one potential solution, orifice, step, grove,
inherent or pocketed compensation among other compensation techniques known
in the art may be employed. Porous air bearings are known in the art and are
described by the inventor in previous applications. Also, methods for providing
clean fluids at pressure are well-known and readily available. The porous media
316 may be comprised of graphite, carbon, silicon carbide, alumina or basically
any sintered or porous material. These materials are typically found as face seals
and mechanical seals and as runners and runner faces in dry gas seals. Just
instead of filling or sealing this porosity which is a common practice the porosity
is used for air bearing functionality.
[0093]        As illustrated in FIG. 3B, there is a shaft 351 and a housing 352
which are coupled through a bearing system 353. Being desirous to isolate the
bearing from the process or environment in area 357 an aerostatic gas seal 355,
consistent with the illustration in figure 300 (except in this example the aerostatic
pressure is plumbed through a flexible tube 356) just shorter axially, is coupled to
the shaft 351 through a high-pressure air film which supports the seal 355 in a
noncontact fashion with respect to the shaft. So the shaft may rotate at a high rate
of speed with virtually no torque transmitted to the seal because of the low shear
forces in the air gap, but the seal is able to follow motions of the shaft without
contact due to the radial stiffness of the air film. The mechanical bellows allows
the seal to follow the shaft rather than keeping it rigidly coupled to the housing.
Additional methods for providing compliance are detailed in other figures in this
                                           -16-

application.
[0094]        In contrast to labyrinth seals cylindrical air bearing seals are coupled
to the shaft via the stiffness of the air film. In example 350 the bushing seal is
supported by the spinning shaft it is sealing on. This allows for eliminating
alignment issues found in labyrinth seals. The seal is stationary with respect to
the Stator and connected to it through some sort of flexible bellows arrangement
354, diaphragm or an axial O-ring as examples of compliant mounts. It would also
be possible to take a circumferential seal and mount it between axial face seals as
described in figure 200 and 800.
[0095]        Bearing isolators similar to those taught in FIGS. 2A and 3B or FIGS.
7-10 may allow for the shifting of the center of the shaft, angular excursions of the
shaft and axial displacements. In some cases these bearing isolators used
pressurized air or water though an uncompensated annular groove to help affect
the seal. These are characterized by high flows and low pressures due to their
large gaps and lack of compensation.
[0096]        In FIG. 4, a shaft 401 which may rotate at high speeds has a blade
runner 405 coupled to it using a mounting ring 413 which is fixed to the shaft by
set screws 403 and or a shoulder. An O-ring 410 may be employed to seal clearance
at 402. There are two illustrations in FIG. 4; in view A the blade 405 is not up
against the porous seal bearing face and the gap 406 allows for a view of the blade
runner 405, in view B, the blade runner is in place and the gap 406 between it and
the porous face 412 is as it would be in operation, less than 25 microns. The blade
itself may be coupled directly to the shoulder if the shaft is so equipped with a
shoulder (a shoulder would be the axial face created by a step in the diameter).
The blade runner is characterized by being thin axially and so differentiated from
conventional runners. The blade may be any thickness but likely between 0.1 and
1 mm thick. This blade runner has the advantage of being light weight and so it
has a minimal effect on the moment of inertia of the shaft and on potential
imbalances caused by the runner. Because the pressure to be sealed in volume 404
                                           -17-

is the same everywhere in the volume it acts uniformly on the back of the blade
flexure, urging it against the air bearing seal face with constant per-unit area
force. For this reason it is not necessary to have a heavy rigid runner connected to
the shaft. The gap 406 will vary but a force equal to and opposite forces existing
in volume 404 will be generated in the air gap. This embodiment may be well
suited for replacing brush type seals especially in turbines designed as aero
engines. As it would seal more effectively, have zero or at lease relatively low
friction or ware and occupy significantly less space axially.
[0097]        High pressure gas some bars higher than what exists in volume 404
is introduced into port 408, which conducts the pressure to the Plenum 409, which
distributes the air pressure uniformly to the backside of the porous media 412
which will create a pressure in the gap 406 at its face and between the runner 405
[0098]        The volume 404 represents a volume on one side of the seal, this could
be a gearbox, a motor-generator housing, or a process fluid or gas such as a mixer,
refiner, water pump or gas pipeline, or a seal between compartments, impellers or
stages in a piece of rotating equipment like a compressor as examples. 414 would
represent the casing or the housing. There may or may not be an adapter plate as
shown in fig 200 number 205. The seal body itself 411 would likely mount to the
housing casing or adapter plate with an O-ring seal 407.             The seal body in
illustration 100 refers to a seal that would be lightly loaded, it should be recognized
that the seal body and its mounting maybe designed to be stiff enough so that it
does not deform significantly under the pressure differentials that are being
sealed. Alternatively it may be designed so that it does flex and so may flex to
cooperate with the conformable nature of the Blade Runner which is essentially a
flat spring steel flexure.
[0099]        As illustrated in FIG. 5A, a conventional centrifugal compressor
employs a sealing and bearing system described here (but this is descriptive of
many other potential applications in rotating equipment); shaft 501 comes from
the compressor camber 504 though a labyrinth seal 502, into the seal cartridge
                                            -18-

503 which fits into the seal chamber within the compressor casing 505. Then a
face or dry-gas seal affected between the primary ring 507 and mating ring 506,
which we will refer to as the primary seal 508. Between the labyrinth 502 and the
primary seal 508 a buffer/flush gas is introduced though port 524, most of this gas
flows back to the process side as the labyrinth seal has a high degree of flow even
with only a bar's worth of pressure difference. This buffer gas is important to keep
the primary seal gap clean. Some of the gas flows across the mechanical face or
aerodynamic primary seal 508 and into the Plenum 509, finally exiting through
vent 510. Then there is a seal gas or inert gas introduced through port 512, as
before most of this flows through labyrinth seal 511 and out vent 510. Some of this
gas does flow through the secondary seal made up of the mating ring 513 and
primary ring 514. This is because the pressure being introduced at 512 is higher
than the pressure in the volume 515. This flow is exhausted through vent 516.
Then there is a separation gas introduced through port 517 which flows through
the separation seal 518. Some of that flow migrates into volume 515 and vents
through 516 and some of that flow makes its way through labyrinth seal 519 (if so
equipped) and into the bearing chamber 520. So we have process and buffer gas
flowing out of vent 510 and this is mixed with seal or inert gas that was introduced
through 512. This needs to be reprocessed or sent to flare. The gas flowing across
the secondary seal and into volume 515 mixes with the separation gas being
introduced through 517 and then exits out of vent 516 and also needs to be sent to
flare or otherwise processed or reported as an emission. Additionally separation
gas flowing into the bearing chamber 520 will find its way out vent 521 and
becomes yet another environmental headache. The bearing chamber has oil
pumped in at pressure through port 522, the oil then needs to be drained out
through port 523 (that may be positioned at the bottom) filtered and cooled to
control its viscosity which important because it is very temperature sensitive.
With all of those tubes coming and going from each end of the compressor, more
than one operator thought he was looking upon Medusa.
                                          -19-

[0100]         As illustrated   in  FIG.    5B, the   services,  complications  and
environmental headaches listed above are eliminated by the following novel
teachings. With reference to figure 550 please notice that oil has been removed as
a lubricating medium for the bearings supporting the compressor shaft. Instead
gas bearings operating on the gas being compressed in the compressor are used to
create an aerostatic air bearing support 560 for the shaft 551. The bearing
cartridge 555 and the bearing chamber and or seal chamber in the compressor
casing 554 may change in new designs to take advantage of the much more
compact design that is possible, but this is not necessary as the gas bearing
cartridge can fit in the same space that the oil bearing cartridge fits into.
[0101]         The preferred embodiment is to use a porous media restriction 558 at
the face of tilting pad externally pressurized air bearings 560. These bearings can
be fed using the same buffer gas that had been employed in the prior art but this
buffer gas is instead pumped into the externally pressurized air bearings 560. The
bearings require a higher pressure differential, likely in the range of 4 to 20 bar
above the pressure on the other side of labyrinth seal in volume 552, but the
volume of this buffer gas flow, that is now bearing gas, is dramatically less than
was required of buffer gas in the prior art, likely less than one cubic foot per
minute per bearing. The buffer gas may be taken from the high-pressure side of
the pump, or the suction side, conducted through filters or dryers, compressed if
taken from the suction side, and then introduced through port 556, into the
bearing 560, distributed to the labyrinth 557 restricted by the porous media 558
and then finally exiting under pressure through the final bearing restriction, gap
559. After the gas has exited the bearing gap 559 it acts to raise the pressure in
the bearing compartment slightly as the used gas will flow back into the process
through the labyrinth seal 553 or some other ring or separation seal that may be
used in that location.
[0102]         In the case that vents are eliminated, there is no reason to have a
process flow into the bearing chamber because there is nowhere for it to go. This
                                           -20-

eliminates having to flare or report vents to atmosphere, and is a huge
environmental advantage. And as there is only one gas to deal with, services are
dramatically simplified, improvements in maintenance costs and downtime and
the reduction in capital costs as seal services capital cost can be a multiple of the
cost of the seal. Safety is also improved, as the elimination of venting also
eliminates the possibility of entraining oxygen into flammable gases being
compressed or allowing dangerous gases to escape.
[0103]        Rotor dynamics are dramatically improved by the use of this
invention, the length of shaft that had previously been consumed by seals may be
eliminated, dramatically stiffening the shaft 551. The diameter of the shaft can be
increased due to the higher speed capability of the gas bearings again stiffening
the shaft and providing more area for squeeze film damping in the gas bearing.
[0104]        The environmental problems and mess associated with oil are
eliminated, there are no more oil leaks. No oil can make it to a face or dry gas seal
and carbonize. Oil no longer controls the temperature which the bearing
compartment can operate at. Gas bearings may operate at the most extreme
temperature ranges, from cryogenic to supper heated steam. It is noted here that
conventional techniques for gluing porous media 558 to the stainless steel or
aluminum bearing housings 560 is not appropriate for extreme temperatures..
[0105]        The compressor or also in the case of a gas turbine or large generator
will have the rotor supported on a frictionless gas film even at zero RPM. This
reduces the risk at startup and shutdown, allows for slow roll and standby
operations without danger of seal hang-ups or bearing damage and enabling
frictionless startups and shutdowns.
[0106]        Because of the excellent aerodynamic properties available from the
smooth porous face, external pressure to the bearing maybe often turned off once
the compressor or turbo machinery is at sufficient speed, as at that point the shaft
will be supported on aerodynamic effects. So the auxiliary compressor (if so
equipped) may be run only at startup and shutdown, or slow roll conditions. If this
                                          -21-

auxiliary compressor failed during operation it would not affect the operation of
the main compressor and the rotor could spin to a stop in a loss of pressure without
damage due to the excellent tribological properties of the steel shaft on a carbon
graphite bearing face. Additionally the technology is appropriate for canned
compressors targeted towards subsea compression as the bearings can take their
pressure from the high pressure side of the pump and have acceptable life as plain
bearings in the start stop cycles. This is a much simpler and more compact way of
eliminating oil than magnetic bearings.
[0107]        But without sealing - and without venting - the bearings operate
under extreme pressures. If the suction pressure of the pump is 100 bar, and the
output side of the compressor was 200 bar, then the bearings could be fed at 106
bar and the flow through these bearings becomes the buffer gas. Bearings that
operate in a 100 bar environment, actually only see a 6 bar pressure difference.
[0108]        As illustrated in FIG. 6A, a shaft 601 which may be turning at a high
velocity has connected to it multiple thin blades as described in figure 400 above.
These blades 614 are fixed to the shaft 601 via a shoulder and bolt 616 and are
separated from one another by precision spacing rings 615. The porous bearing
seals 604 are connected to the Stator 603 via a shoulder and bolt 612. The porous
bearing seals 604 are also separated by precision spacers 605 approximately the
same size or slightly thicker, but preferably not more than 10 p thicker, than the
Blade Runners. There is clearance 610 between the inside diameter of the porous
bearing seals and the outside diameter of the shaft. There is complementary
clearance 611 between the outside diameter of the Blade runners and the inside
diameter of the Stator. This clearance provides for radial motion of the shaft. If
there exists a pressure differential between volume 602 and volume 609, for
instance a higher pressure in volume 602, that pressure will act against the first
blade runner urging it against the first porous bearing seal. But because higher
pressure is being introduced through ports 606 and this pressure is conducted
circumferentially by groove 607 and then radially through the porous bearing seal
                                           -22-

by radial hole 608. This pressure then conducts through the porous media and the
face between the blade and the bearing creating a separating force that is also a
seal.
[0109]        Regarding illustration 6B; this embodiment is likely pertinent to aero
engines as may be found on jet airplanes and or gas turbines that are employing
brush or centrifugal seals. These contact type seals are a maintenance issue, they
create friction and heat which cause efficiency losses and they are noisy. These
issues are in large part solved by employing porous carbon air bearing technology.
Bearing technology is taught in multiple other locations within the specification.
The specific arrangement has a turbine shaft 651 fitted with a mechanism to
retain runners which are flexure mounted to the shaft using parallel flexure
technology. These runners 656 cooperate with a stationary air bearing seal 653
which in this preferred embodiment uses porous media compensation 654. The
stationary part of the seal is mounted to the engine/compressor/generator housing
655 using conventional techniques similar to what would have been employed to
mount the stationary section of the friction based seal. Spacers 657 are used to
approximately locate the runners axially with the stationary parts of the seal add
key off of 652 that is connected to the shaft and secured by 659. Parallel flexures
658 allow the runner to translate axially with respect to the shaft, which will
happen for instance under the acceleration of take off, and yet remain parallel to
the face of the stationary part of the seal.
[0110]        As illustrated in FIG. 6C, a close-up of the flexure seal runner shows
the bearing face 661, the flexure components 662, one of the through holes for
mounting 663 and the area 664 which was either machined, ground or EDM away
from a solid stainless steel blank. There may be other ways to manufacture a
flexure-based runner.
[0111]        As illustrated in FIGS. 7A - 7B, a shaft 701 of a piece of equipment
that is carrying with it a runner 711 that has a spherical outside diameter. The
runner with a spherical OD couples to the shaft through two 0-rings 702. This is
                                           -23-

advantageous because many shafts have experienced damage and/or out of round
at their ends, keyways will often have raised edges, these high spots can damage
a precision air bearing/sealing surface while being slid over these damaged
features and into position. O-rings can tolerate these types of high spots due to
their resiliency. Another advantage is that it reduces tolerance concerns for the fit
at 705. This may not be an issue if a cartridge seal employing this technology is
associated with an accompanying sleeve for the shaft that goes with the cartridge
seal. The OD of the spherical runner mates to complementarily shaped spherical
air bearings, which in the preferred embodiment would be porous media restricted.
Spherical air bearings are mounted in yoke 712 which is split vertically, split not
shown, and air is fed in to the back of the porous restrictive elements 703 through
air input port 706 and distribution labyrinth 704. Using this technique as taught
will provide for an air gap with several bar's pressure between the porous carbon
restrictive element 703 the OD of the spherical runner 711. This air film provides
for a frictionless and ware free way of providing angular freedom to the shaft and
avoiding over constraint from angular changes in the shaft as indicated by 713,
707 and 710. 709 provides a vent in between the two spherical bearings, this avoids
a pressure buildup between the two bearing elements and so the bearings see more
pressure drop and their performance increased.
[0112]         As illustrated in FIG. 7C, the porous media restrictive element 751
is shrunk fit in to the nonporous housing 752 which may be made of aluminum or
steel or stainless steel or some other suitable material. A plenum 753 comprising
approximately 50% of the surface area between the housing and the porous media
and having a conductance at least 10 times that of the free flow through the porous
media may be disposed on the ID of the housing or the OD of the porous media or
some of both. An air feed hole 754 to the plenum provides air flow to the plenum
and then through the porous media and into the bearing gap. The air bearing gap
provides an axial degree of freedom, but as noted above in areas where a precision
shaft is not available, 0-rings or a sleeve for the shaft that comes with the seal
                                           -24-

cartridge may be used. It should be noted that in an embodiment the shaft may
spin within journal gas bearing as well still leaving axial shaft freedom.
[0113]        As illustrated in FIGS. 8A - 8B, freedom for frictionless radial
displacements of the shaft is provided. This is accomplished by taking the yoke
824 and 817 and suspending it between thrust faces. The yoke 824 is keyed with
an anti-rotation to pin (not shown) to keep it from rotating with the shaft. This
anti-rotation pin is provided with enough clearance that allows free motion of the
components over the limited range compliance is intended. This yoke is split at
821 and O-ring seal 820 is employed. A thrust plate or collar 806 of appropriate
strength for the application is provided with porting 807 and plenum 805 for
distributing the air pressure to the back of the porous media 816. The thrust
collars 806 may be sealed at joint 819 by an O-ring in a groove such as 818. The
spherical gas bearings have a plenum 804 and air input port 808 and a restrictive
porous element 803. In this embodiment, there is no vent between the spherical
bearings, instead the high pressure developed in this region is used to conduct
pressure through to the Journal bearing in a non-contact fashion. External
pressurization ported through 810 in stationary housing 822 then to the Plenum
area 823, which is sealed at each side by the thrust bearings, and then through
port 809 into the area between the spherical bearings where it can pass in a
noncontact fashion through port 811 Into Plenum as described in 753, then
through the restrictive element 802 into the gap between the rotor of the
restrictive element bearing face at 814.
[0114]        This embodiment provides for axial freedom of the shaft, angular
freedom of the shaft, and radial displacements of the shaft in a frictionless manner
using bearings which are also seals in all motion locations.
[0115]        The shaft 801 may spin and move axially within the bearing element
802 and the runner 826. The runner is not coupled to anything except through air
bearing films and so it may rotate also. This would allow them to share the speed
of the shaft, so for a shaft spinning at 20,000 RPMs 10,000 RPMs could be taken
                                          -25-

by the Journal bearing 814 if the runner were spinning at 10,000 RPMs and the
other 10,000 RPMs could be taken between the spherical bearings 803, 815 and
the runner 826.
[0116]         The difference between FIGS. 8A and 8B and FIGS. 9A and 9B is that
porting for the opposed axial air bearings which provide friction free radial motion
for the shaft have had the porting 908 and the Plenum 905 moved internal to the
yoke 924 from the thrust plates 906 where they were in figure 800. This simplifies
the manufacturing of the thrust plates 906 and allows them to retain a higher
stiffness for their given axial thickness, because the yoke is seeing a compressive
load in what amounts to column stiffness where the thrust cap sees a cantilevered
bending stiffness which is not as strong. It should be noted that in each of the
bearing arrangements in figure 800 and figure 900 that the interface between the
porous media gas bearing surface and the guide way it acts upon 916, 915 and 914
only one side of the bearing elements are open to ambient pressure, this reduces
the effect of the externally pressurized air bearings but the bearings do retain
significant load capacities.
[0117]         The difference between FIGS. 8A-9B and FIG. 10 is that FIG. 10 is
fully vented, that is all of the gas bearings see the full pressure drop between the
external input pressure and ambient or a process pressures that exist at the escape
edges of the bearings. So the external pressure is ported into the thrust plates
1008 via 1009 and distributed behind the porous media restrictive element by
Plenum 1007. Additionally a through hole 1005 has been drilled through the
porous media and directly in to the Plenum 1007. This whole aligns roughly with
a hole in the yoke 1006, which has a counter bore 1004 that maintains conductance
between 1005 and 1006 during the designed displacements of this compliance
device. It stays aligned due to the anti-rotation pin discussed in figure 800. Hole
1006 provides conductance of pressure to both the spherical bearing element 1003
and the Journal porous bearing element 1002 via the cross hole 1010 drilled in the
yoke 1028 which is later plugged 1011. 1010 delivers the pressure and flow to the
                                           -26-

Plenum 1020 providing the external pressurization for the spherical restrictive
elements/ bearings 1020. Cross hole 1010 also communicates with hole 1012 which
is threaded to accept a fitting, the fitting is connected to a flexible tube which
provides motion compliance in the conductance of pressure to be spherical runner
which is now also keyed to the yoke to provide anti-rotation relative to the yoke.
The pressure and flow for the journal restrictive element 1002 are provided
through the fittings 1014, 1016 via the tube 1015 and into Plenum 1030.
[0118]        An annular groove in the center of the Journal gas bearing portion
provides even communication of the bearing/seal flow to a center vent hole. This
is the radial hole in the spherical runner 1028 and is shown next to fitting 1016.
This whole exhausts in the space between the spherical bearings and both of these
bearings are able to exhausts through the hole that the fittings 1014, 1016 and
tube 1015 partially consume. Hole 1013 through housing 1026 provides the
exhaust for these flows plus flow from the opposed axial faces 1021.
[0119]        In order to effect a seal, as shown in FIG. 11A, a porous material 1102
which comprises one side of two opposing surfaces is used to evenly distribute
hydraulic pressure from an external source of pressurized fluid between the two
surfaces. The pressure is ported through 1106 to Plenum 1108 then through the
porous media 1102 and into the gap 1107. This hydrostatic pressure creates a force
which is opposite the forces from pressure differences or Springs trying to close
the two faces together, the other face being the bearing seal side of 1110. Also see
figure 100 for teaching regarding this illustration 1100. This hydrostatic pressure
may be adjusted to the point where the two faces are completely unloaded and zero
contact pressure exists between the two faces even though the faces are in intimate
contact 1107. Because the faces are in contact there is approximately zero flow
through the gap and the line pressure being fed into the porous material will exist
between the two faces.
[0120]        As illustrated in FIG. 11B, if there is 1000 pounds of force or in this
illustration a 1000 pounds of mass represented by 1124 urging the face of the seal
                                             -27-

body 1123 together with the counter face 1121 and the seal faces have 10 in. 2 of
area between them and 100 PSI air pressure is fed in at port 1125 and this
pressure is distributed cross the back of the porous medium using a Plenum as
taught multiple times before in this specification, the porous seal face will have
exactly zero contact force between the faces as the hydrostatic force between the
faces will equal the mass or force urging the seal faces together. This contact force
can easily be adjusted by varying the input pressure to reduce ware and heat
generated by friction.
[0121]         This technique combines the high stiffness and damping of plane
bearings and contact seals with the low friction and high speed capability of fluid
film bearings and seals.
[0122]         The porous media may be comprised of graphite, carbon, silicon
carbide, Tungsten carbide, alumina or basically any porous and or sintered
material. These materials are typically found as face seals and mechanical seals
and as runners and runner faces in dry gas seals. Just instead of filling or sealing
this porosity the porosity is used to conduct and evenly distribute hydrostatic
pressure.
[0123]         Orifice pocketed or step type air bearing compensations will not work
in this application as only a uniform porous media is capable of evenly distributing
a hydrostatic pressure with zero gap. For instance, if orifices were employed, when
the faces were in contact hydrostatic pressure would only be exerted over the area
of the orifices.
[0124]         As illustrated in FIG. 12, this is an illustration of a solid carbon
graphite tilting pad radial air bearing 1201. When manufacturing it from a single
part rather than attempting to laminate two parts together the trouble of joining
two components together for use under extreme temperatures is avoided. Most
carbon graphite will not start to oxidize until it is in an environment over 8000 C,
so this provides a very extensive temperature range. In this case a Plenum to
distribute the air to the back of the porous media face is accomplished by drilling
                                            -28-

cross holes 1203. These cross holes are threaded and plugged 1204 with high
temperature ceramic or glaze which is later fired so that it becomes co-sintered
with the carbon graphite. A ceramic insert from a metal cutting tool is sintered in
at 1206 at the same time to distribute the load of the Hertzian contact of the tilting
pad mechanism. 1205 represents a high temperature fitting known in the art. 1202
represents a diameter which would be complementary to a shaft that such a
bearing would support.
[0125]         It is also possible to co-fire separate ceramic components, for instance
a nonporous housing with a porous media face. The co-firing essentially makes a
monolithic part but there was an opportunity to machine plenums or labyrinths
into the green parts before they were sintered or fired together. Alternatively a
glass bonding, similar to a glazing operation done on the outside of a piece of
pottery may be employed as a high temperature glue to bond separate ceramic
components into a single high temperature part that could be used as a bearing or
a seal in extreme temperature environments
[0126]         As illustrated in FIG. 13A, a non-rusting material 1300 such as
stainless steel, coated steel, e.g., nickel or ceramic, or anodized aluminum that
may be acted on by an attractive magnetic field of a porous magnet 1301 may be
used since oil is not employed. The material is separated from the magnetic field
of the porous magnet by a pressurized hydrostatic film 1306 is maintained by a
continuous flow of fluid pumped through a porous media. The pressurized fluid is
pumped through the porous media at a relatively higher pressure than a
respective ambient pressure and is supplied to the porous media through an input
port 1302. A labyrinth 1304 distributes the pressurized fluid across the back of the
porous media and may be provided in a non-porous housing 1303. In an alternative
embodiment, the labyrinth may be provided in the porous magnetic material in
itself. In both embodiments, the non-porous housing 1303 and the porous magnet
material 1301 are laminated together by a gluing, glazing or brazing operation
that may take place inside of the housing or on a separate modular bearing
                                               -29-

component. The laminated housing 1303 and porous magnetic material 1301 may
be mounted inside of housing or to a structure using a mounting stud attached
through a flexure, gimbal mount, bolted joint or bonded in place.
[0127]         Regarding the labyrinth and porting 1304, the flow through this
should be significantly higher than the flows expected through the porous media
to keep the labyrinth and porting from becoming a restriction. In other words,
what you see on the pressure regulator should be the pressure that is exposed to
the back of the porous media. The labyrinth should supply air pressure to at least
25% but not more than 75% of the back of the porous media. It should be noted
that it is best not to make the grooves in the labyrinth wider than the thickness of
the porous media. It is very important that the pressure differential to the back of
the porous media and the pressure in the bearing gap not cause the porous media
to blow up into the bearing gap. In fact, it is preferred have the bow of the porous
media from the said pressure differential to be less than 10% of the design gap, as
shown in FIG. 13D.
[0128]         As illustrated in FIG. 13B, high pressure fluid supplied through an
aperture 1311 to a hole in the seal body is distributed axially and radially between
a seal body 1308 and a porous media 1307 by a labyrinth 1309 that evenly
distributes the pressurized fluid to a backside of the porous media. The labyrinth
1309 can alternatively be positioned in the porous media 1307 or the seal body
1308. A plenum that comprises approximately 50% of the surface area between
the housing and the porous media may be disposed on the inner diameter of the
housing or the outer diameter of the porous media. In one embodiment, the plenum
may be dispose on both the inner diameter of the housing and the outer diameter
of the porous media. The plenum has a conductance at least 10 times that of the
free flow through the porous media.
[0129]         The porous media layer 1307, shown in FIG. 13B, is generally
between 0.020 and 0.200 inches thick and can be shrunk fit and/or bonded into the
nonporous housing 1308. The air distribution labyrinth 1309 may be disposed
                                           -30-

between the porous media layer 1307 and the housing 1308. Finish boring of the
porous media face/journal may be performed to increase or decrease the diameter
of the porous media face/journal to a desired diameter. In an alternative
embodiment, turning for finish flatness of a thrust face is performed. Air
distribution channels or gaps have a labyrinth that distributes air to at least 25%
of the surface but not more than 75% of the surface exposed to the high pressure
source. Generally the air gaps are between one 0.0001 and 0.001 of an inch thick
with shear energy. The flow through the gap is a function of the gap that may be
squared or cubed. The flow through the porous media is determined by the desired
flow through the gap; generally the ratio is approximately two times the desired
flow of the shaft or thrust face in place. As the speed of the shaft increases, the
ideal gap thickness also increases to minimize heat buildup through shear energy
losses.
[0130]        As illustrated in FIG. 13C, a compressor (oil has been removed as a
lubricating medium for the bearings supporting the shaft) has gas bearings that
operate on compressed gas and are used to generate an externally pressurized gas
bearing support 1320 for the shaft 1315. A bearing cartridge 1319 and a bearing
chamber and/or seal chamber in the compressor casing 1318 may be compactly
designed; however this is not necessary as the gas bearing cartridge can fit in the
same space that an oil bearing cartridge fits into. In one preferred embodiment, a
porous media restriction 1323 occurs at the face of the tilting pad of the externally
pressurized gas bearings 1320. These bearings 1320 can be fed using buffer gas
that is pumped into the externally pressurized gas bearings 1320. The bearings
1320 require a higher pressure differential, in the range of 4 to 20 bar above the
pressure on the other side of labyrinth seal in a volume 1316. The volume of the
buffer gas flow, e.g., bearing gas, is dramatically less than the buffer gas required
in the prior art, e.g., less than one cubic foot per minute per bearing.
[0131]        The buffer gas may be taken from the high-pressure side of the pump,
or the suction side, conducted through filters or dryers, compressed (suction side),
                                            -31-

and introduced through a port 1321 into the bearing 1320 and distributed to the
labyrinth 1322. The labyrinth is restricted by the porous media 1323. The buffer
gas exits the labyrinth under pressure through a final bearing restriction gap
1324. After the gas has exited the bearing gap 1324, it acts to raise the pressure
in the bearing compartment slightly. This occurs because the used gas flows back
into the process through the labyrinth seal 1317 or through some other ring or
separation seal that may be used in that location. In the preferred embodiment,
all vents are eliminated and process flow does not enter the bearing chamber. This
eliminates having to flare or report vents to atmosphere and allows for "canned"
motor possibilities in future turbo machinery          designs. In the preferred
embodiment, rotor dynamics are dramatically improved and the length of the
shaft, previously consumed by seals, may be eliminated. This results in a
dramatically stiffer shaft 1315.
[0132]        Due to the stiffening of the shaft, the diameter of the shaft can be
increased due to higher speed capability and, consequently, increased area for
squeeze film damping in the gas bearing is provided. Unlike oil, which controls the
temperature that the bearing compartment can operate at, gas bearings may
operate at extreme temperature ranges from cryogenic to a superheated stream.
Conventional techniques for gluing porous media 1323 to stainless steel or
aluminum bearing housings 1320 is not appropriate for extreme temperatures.
The compressor, gas turbine, or other large generator, supports the rotor on a
frictionless gas film, even at zero RPM. This enables frictionless startups and
shutdowns and allows for slow roll and standby operations while reducing the risk
of seal hang-ups and bearing damage. Because of the aerodynamic properties of
the smooth porous face, external pressure to the bearing may be turned off once
the compressor or turbo machinery has reached a sufficient speed because the
shaft is supported by aerodynamic effects. An auxiliary compressor may be run
only at startup and shutdown, or during slow roll conditions.        Failure of an
auxiliary compressor during operation and loss of pressure does not affect the
                                          -32-

operation of the main compressor and the rotor may spin to a stop without damage.
This is due to the tribological properties of the steel shaft on a carbon graphite
bearing face. The preferred embodiment may be used in "canned" compressors
targeted towards subsea compression as the bearings can take their pressure from
the high pressure side of the pump and have acceptable life as plain bearings in
start/stop cycles.
[0133]        But, without sealing and without venting the bearings operate under
extreme pressures. For example, where the suction pressure of the pump is 100
bar and the output side of the compressor is 200 bar, the bearings could be fed at
106 bar and the flow through the bearings would become the buffer gas; bearings
that operate in a 100 bar environment see only a 6 bar pressure difference.
[0134]        In order to appreciate the need for support of the porous media via
the lands of the channels, the following discussion is provided. Referring to Figure
13D, an example is provided for porous media which is supported vs. that which
is unsupported. In order to calculate the maximum deflection of the porous media
under pressure (say, at 600 psig), "Plate Formulas" by William Griffel (Frederick
Ungar Publishing Co., New York) are used. In Griffel's book, the maximum
deflection can be calculated for both a supported and unsupported case.            A
modulus of elasticity of 1.4x10 6 psi is used to correspond to graphite as cited in
prior art (e.g., Union Carbon Grade ATJ) wherein an unsupported plenum is
taught.
[0135]        In Figure 13D, for the supported case, Griffel's case 37 yields a
maximum deflection of 0.00005 inch.
[0136]        In Figure 13D, for the unsupported case (which is consistent as in the
case of other prior art), Griffel's case 37 yields a maximum deflection of 0.0002
inch (which is greater than certain minimum air gaps required for externally
pressurized gas bearings). There are many cases of prior art which show
improperly supported porous media, such as U.S. Patent 4,710,035 (Tittizer), U.S.
                                           -33-

Patent 6,404,845 (Sharpless), U.S. Patents 2,683,635 and 2,683,636 (Wilcox), U.S.
Patent 4,848,710 (Ohta), and others.
[0137]         The    unsupported   configuration     is  inadequate    in preventing
distortion since it yields under pressure. Yielding may result in increased
deflection that is greater than the air gap resulting in rub or "clamping" of a
mating component. The externally pressurized gas bearing cannot function
properly when the unsupported configuration distorts so that the deflection is
greater than the air gap.
[0138]         As illustrated in FIG. 14, a radial, externally pressurized gas bearing
1401 is manufactured of a single solid carbon graphite tilting-pad. The use of a
single carbon graphite tilting-pad avoids the need for lamination of multiple
components at high temperatures since most carbon graphite will not oxidize until
the temperature has exceeded 8000 C. As shown in FIG. 14, a Plenum is used to
distribute air through cross holes 1403 to a backside of a porous media face. These
cross holes 1403 are threaded and plugged 1404 with high temperature ceramic or
glaze which is later fired causing the ceramic or glaze to become co-sintered with
the carbon graphite. In one embodiment, a ceramic insert from a metal cutting tool
may be sintered with the ceramic or glaze at 1406 to distribute the load of the
Hertzian contact of the tilting pad mechanism. It is possible to separately machine
plenums or labyrinths and co-fire the separate ceramic components into a single
part, for instance a nonporous housing with a porous media face. In an alternative
embodiment, a glass bonding operation may be employed as a high temperature
glue and used to bond separate ceramic components into a single high temperature
part that can be used as a bearing or a seal in extreme temperature environments.
See generally, FIG. 14, 1402 and 1405. The radial gas bearing should be made such
that the radius is the same size as the shaft minus nothing, plus 0.001 inch.
[0139]         Externally pressurized gas bearings employ compensation to restrict
and control the flow of air into a bearing gap. The object of compensation is to
provide enough air into the bearing gap to maintain load bearing pressure without
                                            -34-

having so much air that stability and stiffness suffer. The key here is that a region
is created that could easily be several bar pressure, and nothing on either side of
this region will pass if it is at a lower pressure. The seal leaks the externally
pressurized gas bearing so that gas is supplied to both sides. For example, a 4 inch
diameter face seal would have a total flow of about 0.5 standard cubic feet per
minute. Because the seal is externally pressurized, it works the same at zero
velocity as it does at operational speeds. In orifice pocketed, or step type
compensation methods, externally pressurized gas bearing compensations do not
work. This is because only a uniform porous media is capable of evenly distributing
a hydrostatic pressure with zero gap. For example, if orifices were employed, when
the faces were in contact, hydrostatic pressure would only be exerted over the area
of the orifices. Porous Graphite externally pressurized gas bearings have been
known for their crash resistance. In spindles, where relative surface speed
between the bearing faces can be quite high, graphite has been used as a bearing
face only and orifice type compensation methods are still employed.
[0140]        Bearings can be designed to operate on process gas by controlling the
porosity of graphite, carbon, or ceramic materials, by known methods such as the
amount of binder to be burned out, the amount of compaction pressure, differences
in the firing schedule, or other methods known in the art of ceramics
manufacturing. It is possible to adjust the porosity used to restrict the flow of gas
in the gas bearing to the molecular weight and/or viscosity of the gases to be used
in the Turbo equipment. Typical porosity of porous media for externally
pressurized seals and bearings is between 2-20%.
[0141]        As illustrated in FIGS. 15A - 15B, in the manufacture of porous
media for externally pressurized gas bearings ceramic casting techniques
commonly known in the art can be employed.             The following outlines such
techniques and methodology as found in open literature.
[0142]        Dry pressing involves the bi-directional compaction of ceramic spray
dried powder and is generally used in high volume applications requiring complex
                                          -35-

geometry and high tolerances (typically +/- 1% above 10mm and +/-0.1mm below
10mm). With mechanical presses of between 2 and 100 tons, components in a wide
range of sizes and materials can be produced.
[0143]        Freeze casting is a process for casting ceramics. Powdered ceramic
mixed with a water-based gel is cooled to -50 0 C. The expansion of the water as it
freezes compacts the powder into the precise shape of the mold. Freeze casting
offers benefits above what currently available refractory ceramics can provide.
[0144]        For components requiring high precision, and medium to high
volumes, typically using high purity Aluminas, offers the same benefits of a plastic
injection molded component along with the excellent material properties of an
advanced ceramic. The benefits of ceramic injection molding include: excellent
tolerance achievable (+/- 0.025mm), high surface quality without the need for
additional finishing processes, and an economic option for otherwise high cost
production components.
[0145]        Isostatic pressing is used for cylindrical components.         Isostatic
pressing is an omni- directional compaction of ceramic powder in a flexible mould.
Iso-pressed parts can be produced in almost all of the materials used for dry
pressing. This also allows for producing designs with fluted shafts and a number
of features in the pressing.
[0146]        Extrusion is ideal for products with a regular cross section and offers
the advantage of long lengths of product with uniform density. A ceramic (typically
from Alumina, Magnesia or Silicates) is mixed with a plasticized carrier and forced
through a die to produce the product which is cut to required length. Volumes can
be relatively small to very large, and product diameters of less than 1mm and
bores of less than 0.25mm can be accommodated.
[0147]        In slip casting, sometimes called drain casting, a plaster of Paris
mold is filled with a slip. Slip is a liquid containing a ceramic material in a water
suspension. As the mold absorbs water, the ceramic suspension solidifies
uniformly on the walls of the mold. Once the desired wall thickness is reached, the
                                             -36-

remaining slip is drained, the mold is separated or broken, and the part is
removed. The part, now in a powder compact or green stage, is then sintered in an
oven.
[0148]         In tape casting, ceramic powder is mixed with binding and dispersant
agents, solvents, binders, plasticizers and is called a "Slip". This is a slurry that is
then cast into a leveling device that creates a measured outlet onto a moving belt.
The moving belt controls the thickness of the tape - down to 5 pm w/widths up to
2 m. Porosity and characteristics tightly controlled by powders in Slip. Tape is in
a "green" state and is flexible for further processing. This can be laminated or
bonded to other ceramics in final firing process. Ultimately tape thicknesses will
be achievable on the nanometer scale. This process can be automated and
production sped up for lower costs with higher engineered materials.
[0149]         For finishing, copper plate and hard plate polishing techniques can
be used to produce excellent quality surface finish and flatness. Lapping/polishing
(flat-face), outer diameter finish, bore grinding, double-sided (face) grinding, and
centerless grinding techniques may be used.
[0150]         Porous bearings create a mitigating force during crashes because
they are not dependent on a gap to distribute air pressure across the face of a
bearing. An orifice bearing in an overload condition will collapse, closing the gap
and leaving only the area of the orifice or grooving to exert air pressure. This
means after collapse that the bearing faces will see nearly the entire load as plain
bearings. In contrast, porous bearing faces will continue to exert air pressure
across the entire bearing area, even in a zero gap and zero flow situations. In fact,
the force created will equal the line pressure multiplied by the projected surface
area. In order to show this effect in operation, several experiments were performed
to determine the static coefficient of friction of graphite on granite and the effect
air pressure to the bearing has on static friction before lift-off.
[0151]         As illustrated in FIGS. 16A - 16B, in a multi-stage 1601 Steam
Turbine, a shaft 1602 is supported by oil bearings 1603 and seals 1604. The shaft
                                           -37-

supports impellers. The stages 1601 of the impellers have axial and radial stator
clearances at their perimeters to account for thermal changes, manufacturing
errors, rotor dynamics and bending of the shaft. The shaft is not very stiff since
the shaft length is approximately 10 times greater than the shaft diameter and
cantilevered between the bearings. Gas bearings eliminate the need for this
problematic cantilevered design. It is often noted that magnetic bearings have an
advantage over other bearings since they can actively influence the shaft to
improve rotor dynamics. However, employing bearings directly where the shaft
and impellers are doing their work is orders of magnitude more effective. As shown
in FIG. 16B, bearings employing steam as the hydrostatic medium, constrain the
shaft radially and axially at the ends as had been the case previously with oil
bearings. Steam bearings do not require protection of the bearings behind a seal
since oil is not used. This is a huge advantage over oil-bearings for maintenance
and mean-time-between-failure. Because externally pressurized gas bearings can
combine sealing and bearing functionality, highly effective seals are also possible
between impeller stages. This eliminates blow-by inefficiencies. Flow through a
gap is a cubed function of the gap, so running clearances between stators and
impellers or vanes have a very sensitive effect on pump efficiencies.
[0152]         Gas bearings can operate at temperature        extremes along the
spectrum of Turbo equipment. For example, externally pressurized gas bearings
can use Freon or superheated steam as the aerostatic/aerodynamic medium. This
enables externally pressurized gas bearings to be employed directly in the flow
path through the Turbo equipment. In the current art of Turbo equipment, the
shaft is typically unsupported through this area. This requires leaving large
clearances between stators (not shown) and vanes or impellers which contribute
to blow-by inefficiencies. Although not shown, just as a steam bearing may be
added at the center of span, such a bearing may be employed between each
impeller stage. This eliminates back flow to less than what is being fed into the
bearings.
                                          -38-

[0153]        As illustrated in FIG. 17, using gas bearings at the perimeter of the
impellers or vanes 1702 and supporting them axially implies relatively high
surface speeds. Unwanted shear in these gaps could become a significant heat
source and limitation, but this does not prevent the application of gas bearings
with sealing functionalities at or near the impeller diameter radial or axially. The
fact that most gases are at least two orders of magnitude less viscous than oil is a
strong argument that externally pressurized gas bearings should be able to have
higher relative surface velocities before problems from viscous shear heating
become a problem. It is true that shear through a gap is a cubed function of the
gap, and so larger gaps are way of reducing shear losses.
[0154]        Because porous media gas bearings have no orifices, grooves, steps or
pockets in their face, they have the best chance of maintaining laminar flow at
high relative surface velocities. The laminar flow regime creates significantly less
drag and heat losses than the turbulent regime. The best way to maintain laminar
flow is to have a featureless bearing face with a fine surface finish. Porous bearings
enable both these requirements.
[0155]        Because the linear growth of the rotor will not match the stator, it is
recommended that axial steam bearings or gas bearings have compliance on both
sides and spring force to urge the pressure issuing face against the impeller, as
shown in FIGS. 1A and 2A. The combination of bearing and sealing functionality
has significant advantages for equipment simplification and the reduction in the
length of the shaft 1703.      This allows for higher speed equipment and more
compact design. One of the biggest advantages of a combination seal and bearing
technology is that it allows for a wholesale revision of equipment design. For
instance, in a centrifugal compressor with multi-stages, illustrated in FIG. 29, a
shaft may be supported on bearings and seals. The shaft supports impellers that
have significant axial and radial clearances at their perimeters, where they are
doing most of their work, to account for rotor dynamics and other motions of the
shaft. In an alternative embodiment, using externally pressurized gas bearings as
                                           -39-

seals at the perimeter of the impellers would improve the pressure that could be
generated by each stage. Such axial bearings/seals would also tend to dampen the
rotor motions and make compression quieter by avoiding back flows between
stages which represent high velocity high pressure flows through unwanted
clearance regions. Such flows are known to have destabilizing effects.
[0156]        As illustrated in FIG. 17, a centrifugal compressor, consistent with
the preferred embodiments, has no seals or bearings on either end of shaft 1703.
These ends could be capped (not shown) without the requirement for any type of
vent, enabling a canned or sealed compressor. If it were the middle compressor, in
a train of compressors driven by a single power source, seals would be needed at
the end but not bearings. Taking this concept further, it could be noted that in
centrifugal compressors and Turbo equipment the stages are connected to a
common shaft, and so it is not possible to optimize the speed of each stage. If each
impeller was supported by a radial externally pressurized gas bearing and also
employed the axial externally pressurized gas bearings as sealing technology, it
would be possible to drive each impeller independently. In the case of turbines,
each turbine stage could also be run at the optimal speed for that particular stage.
Each stage would be supported on its own radial and axial externally pressurized
gas bearings. These bearings also function as highly effective seals. Each stage
can be coupled to its own motor or generator either on the inner diameter or the
outer diameter of the impeller or turbine stage. This would essentially eliminate
the shaft. One of the biggest problems in Turbo equipment is rotor dynamics of the
shaft. One of the best solutions is to get rid of the shaft. This also allows for much
more compact equipment and eliminates the need for aligning shafts on the motor
to a compressor, or a turbine to a generator. These functions could be combined
inside of the same casing, dramatically reducing the size, weight and the cost of
equipment    while   improving the     efficiency by    optimizing    each  stage  and
dramatically improving sealing in between stages. Without a shaft there is no
reason for shaft seals anymore.
                                           -40-

[0157]         As illustrated in FIG. 18, a centrifugal compressor has impellers that
are supported on a stationary shaft via externally pressurized gas bearing seals.
In this manner, each impeller may be spun at a speed that matches its optimum
efficiency and it is possible to spin each impeller at different speeds to
experimentally determine which speed for each impeller results in the optimal
efficiency for the whole set of impellers. Externally pressurized gas bearings are
also employed on the sides of the impellers both to restrain the dynamics of the
impeller and provide axial constraint for the impeller since it is no longer axially
coupled to the shaft. The pressurized gas bearings also provide highly effective
sealing to avoid pressure blow back. In an alternative embodiment the motor could
be at the ID and the radial bearing at the OD.
[0158]         In a preferred embodiment, the shaft 1801 is stationary. The shaft
supports the radial location of the four spinning impellers 1802. The impellers spin
on stationary radial bearings attached to the stationary shaft using the techniques
described previously in this application. High pressure, which must be fed to the
gas bearings, may be supplied from the high-pressure side 1806 of the compressor
to 1804 to distribute the pressure or from an external source to 1805 for the same
distribution. The axial bearings/stage seals 1807 together with their respective
mating impellers are isolated from axial growth of the stationary shaft through
the gas bearing gaps between the radial air bearings and the stationary shaft. By
maintaining a higher pressure between the axial gas bearings/seals and the
impellers and the pressure at the discharge of the impeller blowback between the
stator the impeller is eliminated. Instabilities that are associated with these high
pressure/high velocity flows are also eliminated and the compression ratio and
efficiencies of each of the stages is increased. Noise generated by the compressor
is significantly reduced by eliminating the turbulent flow through labyrinth seals.
Since the shaft 1801 in this embodiment does not turn, another method must be
employed to introduce the power required for compression to the impellers. Today
this can be accomplished with high speed motors that would be integrated with
                                            -41-

each impeller. This will allow each impeller to rotate independently and at
different speeds, whichever       speed happens to result in the best system
performance. The independently operating stages also dramatically improve the
compressor's ability to handle changed processing conditions. In one embodiment,
the motor elements are at the outside perimeter of the impellers, providing easy
access to coils 1808, permanent magnets 1809, or electromagnets for cooling. This
also provides a large circumference onto which to apply torque. The gas pressure
distribution into the labyrinths of the porous bearings is conducted in the same
way as in FIG. 17.
[0159]        As illustrated in FIG. 19, a centrifugal compressor employing
impellers that are supported on a stationary shaft via an externally pressurized
gas bearing. The gas bearing acts as a magnetic element in the motor. The motor
drives the impeller or a generator driven by the impeller. In this manner each
impeller may be spun at a speed that matches its optimum efficiency and it is
possible to spin each impeller at different speeds to experimentally determine
which speed for each impeller results in the optimal efficiency for the whole set of
impellers. Externally pressurized gas bearings are also employed on the sides of
the impellers both to restrain the dynamics of the impeller, provide axial
constraint for the impeller as it is no longer axially coupled to the shaft. The
pressurized gas bearings provide a highly effective seal to avoid pressure blow
back. In an alternative embodiment the motor externally pressurized gas bearing
combination could be employed at the outer diameter or in the thrust bearings
near the OD or ID.
[0160]        In on embodiment, shown in FIG. 19, a stationary shaft 1901 is
shown    with a     significantly  larger  diameter    in order    to  provide    more
circumferential distance at the inside diameter of the impeller and the outside
diameter of the shaft. This increases the radial stiffness of the shaft through the
compression work area, provides area to conduct electrical power to the coils and
to pass cooling fluids down the shaft. This increases the radial stiffness of the shaft
                                          -42-

through the compression work area. As in FIG. 18, the impeller stages may be
driven independently of each other. In this embodiment, a high-speed motor is
used at the ID of the impeller to provide power for compression. The stator coils
1908 are on the OD of the stationary shaft, and the permanent magnets are on the
ID of the impeller. This is inside out compared to most motor designs the
advantage being that the magnets are held on by centrifugal force, rather than
having centrifugal force try to pull off the magnet from the OD of the rotor.
Additionally, it is taught that the neodymium, being porous, can be used as the
restriction for the hydrostatic bearing function. See generally, U.S. Patent No.
8,427,021. This allows the neodymium 1903 to function as both a permanent
magnet for the high-speed motor, and as a restrictive bearing element for its axis
of rotation. Notice in this embodiment that it is being fed 1910 from the high
pressure side of the impeller. As noted before, the axial bearings can be fed 1906
from the high-pressure side of the compressor.          These axial bearings are
constructed using technologies taught in FIGS. 1 and 2, including mounting
compliance techniques as applied in FIG. 18.
[0161]        When using the motor magnet as a bearing element, the high
pressure in the air gap will help retain the magnet on the rotor; using the high
pressure and velocity of air in the externally pressurized gas bearing gap is a
mechanism for cooling the motor. And, by the virtue of the small air gap achieved
by the externally pressurized gas bearing functionality, much higher efficiency can
be achieved by a smaller design clearance between the magnet and coil; this
relationship being a squared function, so dramatic improvements can be made in
motor or generator efficiency.
[0162]        Also it should be noted that the motor magnet bearings could be
employed as the axial bearings running on the sides of the impellers 1902, much
as conventional linear motors employ magnets on either side of the set coils. This
has some advantages especially at high speeds when attempting to keep the
magnets attached to the rotor as their centrifugal force pushes them up against a
                                         -43-

diameter machined into the impeller 1902. Note that the illustration shows that
the axial and radial bearings are being fed 1904 from high pressure side of the
compressor. In an alternative embodiment, these bearings may be fed from a
separate high pressure source (not shown).
[0163]         As illustrated in FIGS. 20A - 20B, an axial compressor employs the
bearings/seals of the present invention and has a set of blades 2002 that rotate
and are driven independently. The blades are constrained axially by parallel and
continuous annular surfaces on both sides at their respective outside and inside
perimeter acting against an axial externally pressurized gas bearing/seals 2007 as
taught in FIG. 1. These bearing/seals can be placed in series, as taught in FIG. 6,
as two-sided stator components. As in FIG. 6, clearance can be designed in
between the thrust faces. Alternatively, the load path of the differential pressures
can be accommodated as a straight line through the center of the bearings/seals.
Assembly begins with the stationary shaft 2001 and a stage stator assembly 2011
with an axial bearing seal according to FIG. 1. An impeller, or set of blades 2002,
with a continuous annular surface, outside and inside perimeters, and rotor
components of the high-speed motor 2003 are inserted over the shaft 2001 and into
a first stator stage 2011 assembly. A spacer 2012, consistent with the thickness of
the impeller between said contiguous parallel surfaces at its perimeters plus the
designed clearances for the gas bearings/seals 2007, is bolted between the first
stator and a portion of a second stator to be bolted in place. This process continues
axially until all the stages for the machine are assembled. A single bolt 2013 can
be run the length of all the components.        High-speed motors/generators at the
outside perimeters allow the stages to run at independent speeds. Consistent with
an axial compressor, a high volume of air can have limited compression, for
instance, to feed a power turbine or large engine, or a high volume of air could
drive the generators creating asynchronous or DC current for use elsewhere. A big
advantage of the present design is that there is no leakage of flow or back-flow
                                           -44-

past the tips or clearance edges of impellers, and the individual impellers may be
driven at different speeds.
[0164]        As illustrated in     FIGS. 21A -      21B, a shaftless turbine that
implements the same techniques noted in FIG. 20, has no center shaft, not even a
stationary shaft. The stator includes components that are slipped over the shaft of
FIG. 20 and bolted together to form a structural stator. The shaftless turbine of
FIGS. 21A - 21B is lighter than the embodiment described in FIG. 20 and would
be appropriate     for aerodynamic     applications.   For example, propulsors     for
lightweight drones require low sound output. Shaftless turbines would also be
appropriate for power turbine applications.
[0165]        As shown in     FIGS. 21A -      21B, the impeller stages do rotate
independently to accommodate the highest efficiency possible. The volume
encompassed by the veins of blades is reduced as the diameter and as the fluid
being compressed are reduced. Each set of blades 2102 rotates and is driven
independently. The blades are constrained axially by parallel and continuous
annular surfaces on both sides at respective outside and inside perimeters that act
against    an  axial   externally   pressurized   gas   bearing/seals  2107.   These
bearing/seals can be placed in series, as taught in FIG. 6, as two-sided stator
components. As shown in FIG. 6, clearance can be designed between the thrust
faces. In an alternative embodiment, the load path of the differential pressures
can be accommodated as a straight line through the center of the bearings/seals.
A spacer 2112, consistent with the thickness of the impeller between said
contiguous parallel surfaces at its perimeters plus the designed clearances for the
gas bearings/seals 2107, is bolted between the first said stator and the next section
of stator to be bolted in place. This process continues axially until all the stages
for the machine are assembled.
[0166]        As illustrated in FIGS. 22A -        22E, in the design of a radial
compressor     or   expander,    e.g.,  a   compressor-loaded    turboexpander      as
manufactured by Air Products, the conventional oil bearings and seals are
                                           -45-

removed and replaced with externally pressurized gas bearings 2203 and 2207
that support the impellers and provide sealing directly on the back of the impeller.
This enables dramatic shortening of the shaft between the impellers while
maintaining the maximum possible distance between the bearing surfaces
supporting the impellers. Externally pressurized gas bearings enable high speeds
with low frictional losses and heat generation; oil is entirely eliminated. The
bearing seals can operate on process gases, steam or at cryogenic temperatures.
Cost effectiveness and simplicity of this design makes energy recovery more
economical.
[0167]         In a expander/compressor with adjacent stages, e.g., as seen in a
compressor-loaded turboexpander as manufactured by Air Products, is a shaft
supported on rolling or oil bearings, going through seals. The shaft supports
impellers cantilevered off the bearings which need to have significant axial and
radial clearances at their perimeters, where they are doing most of their work, to
account for rotor dynamics and other motions of the shaft. The shaft cannot be
very stiff as the shaft length between impellers is a five times or more multiple of
its diameter.
[0168]         In an alternative embodiment, shown in FIG. 22A, using externally
pressurized gas bearings as seals at the perimeter of the impellers 2207 would
dramatically improve the dynamics and cost by eliminating the seals and oil
bearings. The externally pressurized gas bearing seal combination could operate
at cryogenic temperatures (-300C), or on superheated steam. Air feed pressure
could be from the high pressure side. Such aerostatic axial, radial bearings/seals
would also tend to damp the rotor motions. Most importantly the bearings would
allow for a much shorter shaft 2201 and hold the shaft as a stiff shaft. The stator
2211 has at least one port 2204 to accept pressurized gas. Passageways through
the stator are used to distribute the pressurized gas to labyrinths (not shown in
this illustration, but taught in FIGS. 1, 2 and 3) behind the porous media, used as
a restrictive element in the radial 2203 and axial 2207 gas bearings. For example,
                                           -46-

the porting 2208 shown in the lower half of the stator in FIG. 22A allows gas that
has been pumped through the porous media restriction and through the restriction
of the actual bearing gap to escape to low-pressure. In this example, pressurized
gas is percolated through the porous media 2207 and into the bearing gap that
exists between the impeller 2202 and the thrust bearings 2207. It exits the gap at
the outside perimeter or the inside perimeter. The clearance area at the inside
perimeter also has the journal bearing gas exiting into it. If you do not provide a
vent, pressure will build up to the pressure that is in the gap and load capacity
will suffer. In this example, venting to the low-pressure side is preferred. Further,
in this example, virtually 100% of the backside of the impeller is supported by a
thrust bearing. This means that cantilevering is completely eliminated and there
is no unsupported surface. This allows for dealing with thrust loads, from the high
pressure, in the working chamber as a column stiffness through the back of the
impeller to the bearing face. Also notice that the length to diameter ratio of the
rotor is on the order of 2:1 rather than 5:1 or 10:1, as is common with expanders.
It should be noted that turbochargers, expanders and radial compressors can be
exposed to dramatic temperature fluctuations. So, some compliance should be
designed in, for instance the methods taught in FIG. 1, or some ability for the
impeller 2202 to translate on the rotor 2201, possibly applying a preload force.
[0169]         One side of the expander could easily be configured into a generator,
including a generator design which would employ magnets on the inside of the
outside perimeter of the rotating shaft. Often the energy released in expanding
gases is dissipated into heat though work, this design makes it economical to
capture more energy as electricity. As shown in FIG. 29, the practice of using an
expander 2901 to drive a gearbox 2902, which would step down the speed and then
feed intoa generator 2903, could be eliminated.
[0170]         FIG 23 shows a dual faced piston that is reciprocated with in a
cylinder by a voice coil motor. The piston is supported in the cylinder with a non
contact externally pressurized gas bearing which derives its pressure source from
                                           -47-

the high pressure side. The annular externally pressurized gas bearings also
provide a sealing functionality. Reed valves or spring-loaded conventional cylinder
valves control the flow fluid being pumped entirely by the pressure differences
created. A voice coil motor situated in the relative center of the cylinder and piston
is used to drive the piston back and forth within the cylinder in a noncontact
fashion.
[0171]        As in dry gas and face seals, biasing or spring loading one thrust side
accounted for thermal growth of the shaft, and support for the impeller directly on
the back of the impeller and near the perimeter was a dramatic improvement in
stability. Such aerostatic axial, radial bearings/seals would also tend to damp the
rotor motions. The elimination of oil reduced thermal isolation requirements as
the gas bearing seal combination could operate at cryogenic temperatures or on
super-heated steam. Gas feed pressure could be from the high pressure side.
[0172]        It is possible to combine the function of the annular graphite bearing
seals with the magnet functionality by employing porous neodymium or various
other magnetic materials.
[0173]        One way of maintaining some reduction between the expander speed
and the generator speed is to use the radius of the impeller as the reducing lever.
It can be seen in Figure 22C that a sleeve at the ID of the rotor was fitted directly
with motor magnets. Also in this design the opposed thrust faces of the previous
two designs were simplified by the use of a magnetic preload against a single
thrust face.
[0174]        Referring to Figure 22D, in yet another reduction of space, the
magnetic preload employed in the previous example is instead provided by the
attractive force between the magnets and the coils of the motor/generator itself.
Notice that the physical weight of the rotating mass continues to be reduced but
there are no issues with inertia or torsional dynamics as the impeller is not hard
coupled to anything.
                                           -48-

[0175]        As motors cooperate with bearings to drive closer to the work being
done, Figure 22E shows porous neodymium made into an externally pressurized
bearing element.
[0176]        As illustrated in FIGS 24A - 24B, convective film coefficients, and
boundary layer effects are key for effective thermal transfer from a surface to air.
By employing externally pressurized gas bearing technology to create a very
stable, high pressure, e.g., multiple atmospheres of pressure not just inches of
water pressure differentials, high velocity air flows through very narrow gaps a
boundary layer scrubbing effect can be achieved that dramatically improves
thermal transfer at significant energy savings. Although the pressure introduced
to the bearing is much higher than fan cooled heat exchangers, the volume of the
air flow is much lower as it is being forced through a very restrictive 10 to 20 p
gap. The energy required to move the air is not significantly different. The heat
capacity of the air is improved because it is compressed, still at 2 to 4 bar as it
flows through externally pressurized gas bearing gap. This high pressure air flows
at speeds in excess of 50 m/s, which very effectively scrubs the boundary layer, you
could think of "wind chill turbocharged".
[0177]        In high performance rotating Turbo equipment, temperature, and
temperature transfer can become a significant production issue. In the heating,
ventilating and cooling industry, temperature transfer is a key component to
efficiency. In both these cases, the use of the high pressure and velocity flows of
gas through a gas bearing gap have some fundamental advantages to conventional
air cooling technologies. First, pressurized air in the air gap has a higher density,
and so a higher heat capacity than air that is at or near ambient pressure, as is
typical in fan-blown radiators and cooling towers. Second, because of the high
pressure, high velocities are also typical of gas bearing gaps; higher velocity of air
means many more air molecules flows across the surfaces. Third, and possibly
most importantly, there is a boundary layer scrubbing effect that cleans away the
molecules that try to attach themselves to the surface being cooled. This boundary
                                           -49-

layer scrubbing effect is much more effective than what can be achieved with fans
because of very high pressures and velocities available with gas bearings.
[0178]        As illustrated in FIG. 24, a pipe carrying hot water 2401 or
condensing steam, or even some fluid that is meant to be heated is integrally
associated with a high thermal conducting attachment technique 2202, e.g.,
cooling fins. The pipe and the cooling fins would be stationary. To achieve cooling
functionality, relatively cool air would be introduced at air input ports 2404. This
air, or gas, is conducted into the donut-shaped porous media discs through hole
2406. The pressurized gas percolates through the porous media disc 2403 and into
the gaps between porous media disc 2403 and the cooling fin 2402. The gas then
flows between two components, scrubbing the boundary layer of the cooling fin,
and carrying away heat. Then, it exits through the exhaust ports 2405 and back
atmosphere.
[0179]        Not shown in any figure is the concept that the externally pressurized
gas bearings taught herein may be instrumented with temperature probes,
proximity probes, force gauges, accelerometers, or any other type of sensor/probe
that may be rendered useful in allowing an operator to monitor the life and health
of the bearing. Such monitoring will allow for recognition of when the bearing is
in need of maintenance. Mounting of such instrumentation can be done by drilling
and potting and/or any means which renders the probe to be adequately secured
for its intended purpose
[0180]        As illustrated in FIG. 27, a "rim-driven" thruster or propulsor 2701,
a type of turbomachine comprises a stator 2702, a rotor 2703, blades 2704 which
are mounted to the rotor 2703, and permanent magnets 2705. Seawater passes
through the rotor-stator gap 2714. As opposed to use of bearings which are
hardened material and lubricated by seawater, which is common in the art, the
use of porous media externally pressurized gas bearings.        Two radial bearing
holders 2710 provides mounting for two porous media radial bearings 2709, to
which gas is supplied via plenum 2712 and through multiple air distribution
                                          -50-

channels 2713 comprising a labyrinth to distribute air to the porous media radial
bearings 2709. Two axial porous media bearings 2707 and 2708 are mounted in
two bearing holders 2706, to which gas is supplied via orifice 2711 and through
channel 2716. The externally pressurized gas bearings are not subject to debris
in the seawater as positive pressure through the porous media prevents such
contamination.
[0181]        As illustrated in FIG. 28, a similar configuration of the externally
pressurized gas bearings of FIG. 27 representing a thruster or propulsor shows
the rim-driven assembly 2803 connected between two pipes 2801 and 2802, and
bolted via flanged members 2804 and 2805, with incoming flow 2806 and exiting
flow 2807. This in-line pumping/circulation embodiment is one which can be used
to circulate flow, as in a refinery or other piping arrangement. This provides a
sealless solution for piping, and one in which the externally pressurized gas
bearings can operate in the process fluid without the possibility of contamination
from any debris, due to the positive pressure supplied to the porous media.
[0182]         Carbon brushes, commonly understood in the art, provide electrical
contact between rotating and stationary components of DC, and some AC,
machines (e.g., motors, generators, alternators, and the like). The brushes carry
current into the rotating parts, and assist in the commutation process. Carbon
brushes are retained by brush holders and maintain contact with a slip ring
assembly or commutator.
[0183]        While carbon brushes vary by material grades (e.g., carbon graphites,
electrographitic brushes, graphites, and metal graphites) and methods of contact
(e.g., various types of brush holders and types of springs), the primary concern in
operation is maintaining the proper amount of contact pressure. If the contact
pressure is too low, any of the following situations can occur: brush sparking,
increased wear of slip ring, increased brush wear, or increased           slip ring
temperature. If the contact pressure is too high, any of the following may occur:
increased mechanical losses, increased brush wear and slip ring wear, and
                                          -51-

increased temperature.       Hence,  a properly maintained contact pressure is
paramount in carbon brush design and operation. Since mechanical and electrical
wear are important considerations (with tradeoffs as contact pressure changes),
an optimal condition would be one in which there is continuous and precise contact
between the brush and slip ring or commutator. One specific source suggests that
for large DC equipment, 4 psi is an optimal pressure - one in which electrical and
mechanical losses are optimized.
[0184]        In order to maintain proper contact pressure, there are various
contributing factors, including: brush and brush holder size, brush holder position,
brush holder angle, and brush holder mounting height. However, the single-most
important factor in maintaining contact pressure has been the spring which is
used. Historically, various types of spring devices have been used, including clock
type springs, torsion bars, lever springs, and helical coil springs. One common
problem is that, as spring force declines over time, an acceleration of electrical
wear occurs.     One solution to maintaining proper force has been the use of
constant-force springs.    However, even constant-force springs have limitations
including a spring force manufactured tolerance of approximately +/- 10%, specific
break-in requirements, and premature performance if they conduct current.
Regardless of the method used, shortcomings remain with respect to the current
art relative to maintaining a constant pressure between carbon brushes and a slip
ring or commutator.
[0185]        As illustrated in FIG. 25A, a constant-pressure carbon brush 2500
comprised of a porous media member 2505 to provide balanced force, a holder
2501, a spring 2503, a conductive wire 2504, with gas is supplied via plenum 2506
and through multiple air distribution channels comprising a labyrinth to
distribute air to the porous media. To accomplish a balanced force, spring force,
which diminishes over time, is balanced by external pressure that is introduced
through the porosity in the carbon brush itself through orifice 2506. To explain
this, assuming that the desired contact pressure is 4 psi, a spring 2503 can be
                                          -52-

designed to transmit a higher pressure than this (e.g., 10 psi). Initially, when the
spring 2503 is new, it is assumed that the pressure from the spring 2503 would be
a full 10 psi.     Since only 4 psi is the desired contact pressure, externally
pressurized air set to 6 psi can be introduced into the carbon brush such that the
resulting (differential) pressure at the porous media restriction face 2507 which
contacts the commutator or slip ring 2502 is 4 psi contact pressure. As the spring
pressure decreases over time, the externally-supplied air will be adjusted
(decreased) such that the resulting contact pressure (differential pressure between
the spring force and the externally-pressurized air) remains constant.
[0186]        In an alternative embodiment, rotary unions, commonly known in
the art as a mechanism that allows the transfer of fluid from a stationary member
to a rotating member, while maintaining sealing at the connection point.
Referring to FIG. 25B, A housing 2508 allows entry of fluid through orifices 2509
which flow into channels within the housing. The fluid is transferred through
orifices 2514 in a rotating member or shaft 2513 and fluid exist the shaft at an exit
2515. In order to preserve the sealing of the mechanism, traditionally, sealing
devices are contained with the housing. In the preferred embodiment, a porous
media bearing seal is used, comprising porous media 2511 in a holder 2510, with
gas supplied via plenum 2512 and through multiple air distribution channels
comprising a labyrinth to distribute air to the porous media.        The externally
pressurized gas bearing seal is installed in the housing 2508 and acts as both a
bearing for the shaft and as a seal, preventing the transferred fluid from escaping
from the overall rotary mechanism. Only one bearing seal has been shown in FIG.
25B, although more than one would typically be used.
[0187]        In a variation of the aforementioned rotary union embodiment, FIG.
25C shows a means of employing balanced force methodology at the face of a rotary
union.    A stationary member 2516 allows flow 2517 through the stationary
member 2516 and through rotating member 2519 which spins in the direction
shown by 2526, without leakage at the face 2522. The stationary member retains
                                          -53-

porous media members 2523 and 2518 in the form of two concentric rings, with an
annular space 2526 between said porous media rings. Gas 2525 is introduced to
the porous media via plenum 2524 and through multiple air distribution channels
to supply gas pressure to both porous media rings. This gas pressure counteracts
a force acting on the top side of the rotary union 2520, which can occur from a
spring, flexure, or other means. The supplied gas pressure and force acting on the
top side of the rotary union are balanced such that the gap at face 2522 is zero,
and such that there is no contact, this preventing leakage when flow 2517 passes
from the stationary member 2516 through the rotating member 2519 and into the
working side 2521 of a machine, such as into a machine tool spindle, or other
similar member.
[0188]        As illustrated in FIG. 26, the concept of balanced force is shown with
differentially-pumped grooves. In this embodiment, a shaft 2601 rotates with a
runner 2602 attached to it. A seal housing 2604 is attached to stator 2608, and a
porous media face 2603 has relative motion with runner 2602. For example, a
system pressure 2609 may be at 3,000 psig. The three channels distributing gas
pressure to the porous media 2603 each are supplied with a different and
adjustable pressure.     These adjustable pressures are such that the resulting
pressure at location 2610 will be zero psig. This can be accomplished by having a
pressure at the first channel location of, say 6 bar above system pressure, or,
approximately 3,090 psig, which will be reduced by the time it exits the porous
media, but still higher than system pressure 2609. The next channel 2606 could
be at 2,000 psig, and the last channel 2605 pressure could be at 1,000 psig.
[0189]        Not shown in any figure is the notion that the externally pressurized
gas bearings taught herein may be used for high speed balancing of rotating
equipment. Typically, high speed rotor balancing and testing is performed using
oil lubricated hydrodynamic bearings. Using externally pressurized gas bearings
eliminates the mess associated with use of oil, which results in oil leaking onto
rotating assemblies, and also misting onto various portions of high speed test
                                           -54-

bunkers. Additionally, due to the frictionless, non-contact effects of externally
pressurized gas bearings (even at zero rpm), better rotordynamic analysis is
permitted.    Furthermore, set-up is simplified since oil lubrication of bearings,
along with the associated pressure systems, is eliminated.
