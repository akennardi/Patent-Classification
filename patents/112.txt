TECHNICAL FIELD
         [0002]   This disclosure relates generally to the field of optics, and in particular but not
exclusively, relates to contact lenses.
BACKGROUND INFORMATION
         [0003]   Accommodation is a process by which the eye adjusts its focal distance to
maintain focus on objects of varying distance. Accommodation is a reflex action, but can be
consciously manipulated. Accommodation is controlled by contractions of the ciliary muscle.
The ciliary muscle encircles the eye's elastic lens and applies a force on the elastic lens during
muscle contractions that change the focal point of the elastic lens.
         [0004]   As an individual ages, the effectiveness of the ciliary muscle degrades.
Presbyopia is a progressive age-related loss of accommodative or focusing strength of the eye,
which results in increased blur at near distances. This loss of accommodative strength with age
has been well studied and is relatively consistent and predictable. Presbyopia affects nearly 1.7
billion people worldwide today (110 million in the United States alone) and that number is
expected to substantially rise as the world's population ages. Techniques and devices that can
help individuals offset the effects of Presbyopia are increasingly in demand.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
        [0013]    Embodiments of a system, apparatus, and method of fabrication for an eye
mountable device including one or more flexible conductive layers are described herein. In the
following description numerous specific details are set forth to provide a thorough
understanding of the embodiments. One skilled in the relevant art will recognize, however, that
the techniques described herein can be practiced without one or more of the specific details, or
with other methods, components, materials, etc. In other instances, well-known structures,
materials, or operations are not shown or described in detail to avoid obscuring certain aspects.
        [0014]    Reference throughout this specification to "one embodiment" or "an
embodiment" means that a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection
with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment of the present invention. Thus, the
appearances of the phrases "in one embodiment" or "in an embodiment" in various places
throughout this specification are not necessarily all referring to the same embodiment.
Furthermore, the particular features, structures, or characteristics may be combined in any
suitable manner in one or more embodiments.
1IfS51   1nI;R

                                                   3
            [0015] Described herein is a smart contact lens or eye-mountable device that includes
an accommodation actuator for adjusting the focal distance of the contact lens. In some
embodiments, the accommodation is automatically adjusted in real-time based upon a user's
gazing direction. The accommodation actuator is disposed in a center region of the smart
contact lens (e.g., covering at least the foveal vision). As such, it is desirable that the structural
and electronic components of the accommodation actuator do not unduly obstruct or deteriorate
the quality of the user's center of vision.
            [0016] The accommodation actuator may be implemented with various optoelectronic
devices, but each will require electrodes to electronically control the accommodation actuator.
Accordingly, these electrodes should be transparent, as well as, conductive. The high electrical
conductivity and optical transparency of indium tin oxide ("ITO") have earned this material its
place as the standard transparent conducting material in the optoelectronic device industry.
However, conventional ITO is brittle and therefore not well suited for a flexible contact lens.
The brittleness of ITO dramatically decreases its electrical conductivity upon bending or
folding. Since flexible contact lenses experience numerous mechanical folding and bending
cycles when manipulated, inserted, and worn by a user, the brittleness of conventional ITO is
not desirable.
            [0017] Embodiments of the instant disclosure address the drawbacks of using ITO in a
flexible contact lens by using a transparent, flexible, conductive material to form electrodes for
manipulating the optoelectronic accommodation actuator. In various embodiments, the flexible
conductive electrode material is solvent-based and can be applied through stenciled spraying
techniques, stamp coating processes, or otherwise. The materials used to form the liquid
conductor material includes a colloidal suspension of conductive particles that is cured in place
on the flexible enclosure material of the smart contact lens. Example conductive particles
include carbon nanotubes and metal nanowires (e.g., silver nanowires). In other embodiments,
the liquid conductor material may be a conductive polymer or conductive silicon.
            [0018] Embodiments of the eye-mountable device may include a power supply,
control electronics, an accommodation actuator, a gaze direction sensor system, and an antenna
all embedded within a flexible lens enclosure formed to be contact mounted to an eye (e.g.,
shaped to be removeably mounted to a cornea and allow eyelid motion to open and close). In
one embodiment, the control electronics are coupled to monitor the sensor system to identify
gaze direction/focal distance, manipulate the accommodation actuator to control the optical
power of the eye-mountable device, and provide wireless communications with an external
1z1fl115R11  1

                                                   4
reader. In some embodiments, the power supply may include charging circuitry for controlling
inductive wireless charging of an embedded battery.
            [0019] The flexible lens enclosure may be fabricated of a variety of materials
compatible for direct contact with a human eye, such as a polymeric material, a hydrogel,
PMMA, silicone based polymers (e.g., fluoro-silicone acrylate), or otherwise. The electronics
can be disposed upon a ring substrate embedded within the flexible lens enclosure near its
periphery to avoid interference with incident light received closer to the central region of the
cornea. The sensor system can be arranged on the substrate to face outward towards the eyelids
to detect the gaze direction/focal distance based upon the amount and position of eyelid
coverage over the sensor system. As the eyelids cover different portions of the sensor system,
this changes a characteristic (e.g., its capacitance), which can be measured to determine gaze
direction and/or focal distance.
            [0020] In some embodiments, the gaze direction/focal distance information can then
be used to determine the amount of accommodation to be applied via a see-through
accommodation actuator positioned in a central portion of the flexible lens enclosure. The
accommodation actuator is coupled to the controller to be electrically manipulated thereby via
the application of a voltage across a pair of flexible conductive electrodes. For example, the
accommodation actuator may be implemented with a liquid crystal cell that changes its index of
refraction in response to an applied electrical bias signal across the flexible conductive
electrodes. In other embodiments, the accommodation actuator may be implemented using
other types of electro-active materials such as electro-optic materials that vary refractive index
in the presence of an applied electric field or electro-mechanical structures that change the shape
of a deformable lens. Other example structures that may be used to implement the
accommodation actuator include electro-wetting optics, micro-electro-mechanical systems, or
otherwise.
            [0021] FIG. 1 is a functional block diagram of an eye-mountable device 100 with gaze
tracking for auto-accommodation along with an external reader 105, in accordance with an
embodiment of the disclosure. The exposed portion of eye-mountable device 100 is a flexible
lens enclosure 110 formed to be contact-mounted to a corneal surface of an eye. A substrate
115 is embedded within or surrounded by flexible lens enclosure 110 to provide a mounting
surface for a power supply 120, a controller 125, a sensor system 135, an antenna 140, and
various interconnects 145 and 150. An accommodation actuator 130 is embedded within
flexible lens enclosure 110 and coupled to controller 125 to provide auto-accommodation to the
wearer of eye-mountable device 100. The illustrated embodiment of power supply 120 includes
1z1nfl;R511  1

                                                  5
an energy harvesting antenna 155, charging circuitry 160, and a battery 165. The illustrated
embodiment of controller 125 includes control logic 170, accommodation logic 175, and
communication logic 180. The illustrated embodiment of reader 105 includes a processor 182,
an antenna 184, and memory 186.
            [0022] Controller 125 is coupled to receive feedback control signals from sensor
system 135 and further coupled to operate accommodation actuator 130. Power supply 120
supplies operating voltages to the controller 125 and/or the accommodation actuator 130.
Antenna 140 is operated by the controller 125 to communicate information to and/or from eye
mountable device 100. In one embodiment, antenna 140, controller 125, power supply 120, and
sensor system 135 are all situated on the embedded substrate 115. In one embodiment,
accommodation actuator 130 is embedded within a center region of flexible lens enclosure 110,
but is not disposed on substrate 115. Because eye-mountable device 100 includes electronics
and is configured to be contact-mounted to an eye, it is also referred to herein as an ophthalmic
electronics platform, a contact lens, or a smart contact lens.
            [0023] To facilitate contact-mounting, the flexible lens enclosure 110 can have a
concave surface configured to adhere ("mount") to a moistened corneal surface (e.g., by
capillary forces with a tear film coating the corneal surface). Additionally or alternatively, the
eye-mountable device 100 can be adhered by a vacuum force between the corneal surface and
flexible lens enclosure 110 due to the concave curvature. While mounted with the concave
surface against the eye, the outward-facing surface of flexible lens enclosure 110 can have a
convex curvature that is formed to not interfere with eye-lid motion while the eye-mountable
device 100 is mounted to the eye. For example, flexible lens enclosure 110 can be a
substantially transparent curved disk shaped similarly to a contact lens.
            [0024] Flexible lens enclosure 110 can include one or more biocompatible materials,
such as those employed for use in contact lenses or other ophthalmic applications involving
direct contact with the corneal surface. Flexible lens enclosure 110 can optionally be formed in
part from such biocompatible materials or can include an outer coating with such biocompatible
materials. Flexible lens enclosure 110 can include materials configured to moisturize the
corneal surface, such as hydrogels and the like. Flexible lens enclosure 110 is a deformable
("non-rigid") material to enhance wearer comfort. In some instances, flexible lens enclosure
110 can be shaped to provide a predetermined, vision-correcting optical power, such as can be
provided by a contact lens. Flexible lens enclosure 110 may be fabricated of various materials
including a polymeric material, a hydrogel, PMMA, silicone based polymers (e.g., fluoro-silicon
acrylate), or otherwise.

                                                   6
            [0025] Substrate 115 includes one or more surfaces suitable for mounting sensor
system 135, controller 125, power supply 120, and antenna 140. Substrate 115 can be employed
both as a mounting platform for chip-based circuitry (e.g., by flip-chip mounting) and/or as a
platform for patterning conductive materials (e.g., gold, platinum, palladium, titanium, copper,
aluminum, silver, metals, other conductive materials, combinations of these, etc.) to create
electrodes, interconnects, antennae, etc. In some embodiments, substantially transparent
conductive materials (e.g., indium tin oxide or the flexible conductive materials discussed
below) can be patterned on substrate 115 to form circuitry, electrodes, etc. For example,
antenna 140 can be formed by depositing a pattern of gold or another conductive material on
substrate 115. Similarly, interconnects 145 and 150 can be formed by depositing suitable
patterns of conductive materials on substrate 115. A combination of resists, masks, and
deposition techniques can be employed to pattern materials on substrate 115. Substrate 115 can
be a relatively rigid material, such as polyethylene terephthalate ("PET") or another material
sufficient to structurally support the circuitry and/or electronics within enclosure material 110.
Eye-mountable device 100 can alternatively be arranged with a group of unconnected substrates
rather than a single substrate. For example, controller 125 and power supply 120 can be
mounted to one substrate, while antenna 140 and sensor system 135 are mounted to another
substrate and the two can be electrically connected via interconnects.
            [0026] Substrate 115 can be shaped as a flattened ring with a radial width dimension
sufficient to provide a mounting platform for the embedded electronics components. Substrate
115 can have a thickness sufficiently small to allow the substrate to be embedded in flexible lens
enclosure 110 without adversely influencing the profile of eye-mountable device 100. Substrate
115 can have a thickness sufficiently large to provide structural stability suitable for supporting
the electronics mounted thereon. For example, substrate 115 can be shaped as a ring with a
diameter of about 10 millimeters, a radial width of about 1 millimeter (e.g., an outer radius 1
millimeter larger than an inner radius), and a thickness of about 50 micrometers. Substrate 115
can optionally be aligned with the curvature of the eye-mounting surface of eye-mountable
device 100 (e.g., convex surface). For example, substrate 115 can be shaped along the surface
of an imaginary cone between two circular segments that define an inner radius and an outer
radius. In such an example, the surface of substrate 115 along the surface of the imaginary cone
defines an inclined surface that is approximately aligned with the curvature of the eye mounting
surface at that radius.
            [0027] In some embodiments, power supply 120 and controller 125 (and the substrate
115) can be positioned away from the center of eye-mountable device 100 and thereby avoid
1z1fl115R11  1

                                                  7
interference with light transmission to the eye through the center of eye-mountable device 110.
In contrast, accommodation actuator 130 can be centrally positioned to apply optical
accommodation to the light transmitted to the eye through the center of eye-mountable device
110. For example, where eye-mountable device 100 is shaped as a concave-curved disk,
substrate 115 can be embedded around the periphery (e.g., near the outer circumference) of the
disk. In some embodiments, sensor system 135 includes one or more discrete capacitance
sensors that are peripherally distributed to sense the eyelid overlap.
         [0028]   In the illustrated embodiment, power supply 120 includes a battery 165 to
power the various embedded electronics, including controller 125. Battery 165 may be
inductively charged by charging circuitry 160 and energy harvesting antenna 155. In one
embodiment, antenna 140 and energy harvesting antenna 155 are independent antennae, which
serve their respective functions of energy harvesting and communications. In another
embodiment, energy harvesting antenna 155 and antenna 140 are the same physical antenna that
are time shared for their respective functions of inductive charging and wireless
communications with reader 105. Charging circuitry 160 may include a rectifier/regulator to
condition the captured energy for charging battery 165 or directly power controller 125 without
battery 165. Charging circuitry 160 may also include one or more energy storage devices to
mitigate high frequency variations in energy harvesting antenna 155. For example, one or more
energy storage devices (e.g., a capacitor, an inductor, etc.) can be connected to function as a
low-pass filter.
         [0029]   Controller 125 contains logic to choreograph the operation of the other
embedded components. Control logic 170 controls the general operation of eye-mountable
device 100, including providing a logical user interface, power control functionality, etc.
Accommodation logic 175 includes logic for monitoring feedback signals from sensor system
135, determining the current gaze direction or focal distance of the user, and manipulating
accommodation actuator 130 in response to provide the appropriate accommodation. The auto
accommodation can be implemented in real-time based upon feedback from the gaze tracking,
or permit user control to select specific accommodation regimes (e.g., near-field accommodation
for reading, far-field accommodation for regular activities, etc.). Communication logic 180
provides communication protocols for wireless communication with reader 105 via antenna 140.
In one embodiment, communication logic 180 provides backscatter communication via antenna
140 when in the presence of an electromagnetic field 171 output from reader 105. In one
embodiment, communication logic 180 operates as a smart wireless radio-frequency
identification ("RFID") tag that modulates the impedance of antenna 140 for backscatter

wireless communications. The various logic modules of controller 125 may be implemented in
software/firmware executed on a general purpose microprocessor, in hardware (e.g., application
specific integrated circuit), or a combination of both.
         [0030]    Eye-mountable device 100 may include various other embedded electronics
and logic modules. For example, a light source or pixel array may be included to provide visible
feedback to the user. An accelerometer or gyroscope may be included to provide positional,
rotational, directional or acceleration feedback information to controller 125.
         [0031]    FIGs. 2A and 2B illustrate two views of an eye-mountable device 200, in
accordance with an embodiment of the disclosure. FIG. 2A is a top view of eye-mountable
device 200 while FIG. 2B is a perspective view of the same. Eye-mountable device 200 is one
possible implementation of eye-mountable device 100 illustrated in FIG. 1. The illustrated
embodiment of eye-mountable device 200 includes a flexible lens enclosure 210, a ring
substrate 215, a power supply 220, a controller 225, an accommodation actuator 230, a
capacitive sensor system 235, and an antenna 240. It should be appreciated that FIGs. 2A and
2B are not necessarily drawn to scale, but have been illustrated for purposes of explanation only
in describing the arrangement of the example eye-mountable device 200.
         [0032]    Flexible lens enclosure 210 of eye-mountable device 200 is shaped as a curved
disk. Flexible lens enclosure 210 is formed with one side having a concave surface 211 suitable
to fit over a corneal surface of an eye. The opposite side of the disk has a convex surface 212
that does not interfere with eyelid motion while eye-mountable device 200 is mounted to the
eye. In the illustrated embodiment, a circular or oval outer side edge 213 connects the concave
surface 211 and convex surface 212.
         [0033]    Eye-mountable device 200 can have dimensions similar to a vision correction
and/or cosmetic contact lenses, such as a diameter of approximately 1 centimeter, and a
thickness of about 0.1 to about 0.5 millimeters. However, the diameter and thickness values are
provided for explanatory purposes only. In some embodiments, the dimensions of eye
mountable device 200 can be selected according to the size and/or shape of the corneal surface
of the wearer's eye. Flexible lens enclosure 210 can be formed with a curved shape in a variety
of ways. For example, techniques similar to those employed to form vision-correction contact
lenses, such as heat molding, injection molding, spin casting, etc. can be employed to form
flexible lens enclosure 210.
         [0034]    Ring substrate 215 is embedded within flexible lens enclosure 210. Ring
substrate 215 can be embedded to be situated along the outer periphery of flexible lens enclosure
210, away from the central region where accommodation actuator 230 is positioned. In the
1IfS51    1nI;R

                                                     9
illustrated embodiment, ring substrate 215 encircles accommodation actuator 230. Ring
substrate 215 does not interfere with vision because it is too close to the eye to be in focus and is
positioned away from the central region where incident light is transmitted to the light-sensing
portions of the eye. In some embodiments, ring substrate 215 can optionally be formed of a
transparent material to further mitigate effects on visual perception. Ring substrate 215 can be
shaped as a flat, circular ring (e.g., a disk with a centered hole). The flat surface of ring
substrate 215 (e.g., along the radial width) is a platform for mounting electronics and for
patterning conductive materials to form electrodes, antenna(e), and/or interconnections.
         [0035]    Capacitive sensor system 235 is distributed about eye-mountable device 200 to
sense eyelid overlap in a manner similar to capacitive touch screens. By monitoring the amount
and position of eyelid overlap, feedback signals from capacitive sensor system 235 can be
measured by controller 225 to determine the approximate gaze direction and/or focal distance.
In the illustrated embodiment, capacitive sensor sytem 235 is formed by a series of parallel
coupled discrete capacitive elements. Other implementations may be used.
         [0036]    Accommodation actuator 230 is centrally positioned within flexible lens
enclosure 210 to affect the optical power of eye-mountable device 200 in the user's center of
vision. In various embodiments, accommodation actuator 230 includes an element that changes
its index of refraction under the influence of flexible conductive electrodes manipulated by
controller 225. By changing its refractive index, the net optical power of the curved surfaces of
eye-mountable device 200 is altered, thereby applying controllable accommodation.
Accommodation actuator 230 may be implemented using a variety of different optoelectronic
elements. For example, accommodation actuator 230 may be implemented using a layer of
liquid crystal (e.g., a liquid crystal cell) disposed in the center of flexible lens enclosure 210. In
other embodiments, accommodation actuator 230 may be implemented using other types of
electro-active optical materials such as electro-optic materials that vary refractive index in the
presence of an applied electric field. Accommodation actuator 230 may be a distinct device
embedded within enclosure material 210 (e.g., liquid crystal cell), or a bulk material having a
controllable refractive index. In yet another embodiment, accommodation actuator 230 may be
implemented using a deformable lens structure that changes shape under the influence of an
electrical signal. Accordingly, the optical power of eye-mountable device 200 is controlled by
controller 225 with the application of electric signals via one or more electrodes extending from
controller 225 to accommodation actuator 230.
         [0037]    FIG. 3 is an explode perspective view illustrating an eye-mountable device 300,
in accordance with an embodiment of the disclosure. Eye-mountable device 300 is one possible

implementation of eye-mountable devices 100 or 200, but the exploded perspective illustration
shows additional details of various components. The illustrated embodiment of eye-mountable
device 300 includes a flexible lens enclosure including an anterior layer 305 and a posterior
layer 310, an anterior flexible conductive electrode (ANT) 315, a posterior flexible conductive
electrode (POST) 320, a liquid crystal ("LC") layer 325, a ring substrate 330, a power supply
335, a controller circuit 340, an anterior contact pad 345, and a posterior contact pad 350
(hidden in FIG. 3). Collectively, the ANT 315, LC layer 325, and POST 320 form an
accommodation actuator that is manipulated under the influence of controller circuit 340. The
illustrated embodiment of ANT 315 includes a connection tab 360 and the illustrated
embodiment of POST 320 includes a connection tab 365.
            [0038] ANT 315 and POST 320 are transparent electrodes that electrically manipulate
LC layer 325 via the application of a voltage across the electrodes. ANT 315 and POST 320 are
flexible conductors that substantially maintain their conductivity even in the presence of cyclical
mechanical stressing including folding and bending. ANT 315 and POST 320 are formed from
a liquid conductor material that is cured onto, and therefore conform to, the curved surfaces of
anterior layer 305 and posterior layer 310, respectively. For example, this liquid conductor
material may be colloidal suspension of conductive particles. These conductive particles can
include carbon nanotubes, metal nanowires (e.g., silver nanowires), or otherwise. In other
embodiments, the liquid conductor material may be a conductive polymer or conductive silicon.
            [0039] ANT 315 and POST 320 can be applied to anterior layer 305 and posterior
layer 310, respectively, using a variety of techniques. In one embodiment, the liquid conductor
material is spray coated on the inside concave surface of anterior layer 305 using a conforming
concave stencil and is also spray coated on the inside convex surface of posterior layer 310
using a conforming convex stencil. In other embodiments, the spray coating may be actively
controlled without use of stencils, or applied after application of a temporary mask. In yet other
embodiments, the liquid conductor material is coated onto a stamp with a conforming shaped
surface that is then pressed to anterior layer 305 or posterior layer 310 to transfer the liquid
conductor material. Other application techniques may also be used to form and position ANT
315 and POST 320 onto anterior layer 305 and posterior layer 310, respectively.
            [0040] In one embodiment, ANT 315 and POST 320 are formed as part of an iterative
process of material application and curing/annealing that builds up multiple layers to achieve a
desired total sheet resistance. Target sheet resistances may range between 100 ohms/square to
2000 ohms/square (e.g., 190 ohms/square). Of course, other target sheet resistances outside this
range may also be used. The number of application and curing iterations to achieve a desired

                                                   11
target sheet resistance may range between 1 to 10 iterations, but is expected to typically range
between 1 to 4 applications.
            [0041] FIGs. 4A-4C illustrate example orientations of ANT 315 and POST 320 within
eye-mountable device 300, in accordance with an embodiment of the disclosure. FIG. 4A
illustrates ANT 405 formed onto the concave inside surface of anterior layer 305, FIG. 4B
illustrates a POST 410 formed onto the convex inside surface of POST 320, and FIG. 4C is a
plan view illustration of a fully assembled eye-mountable device 300. FIG. 5 is a profile
illustration of a portion of ring substrate 330 that forms electrical connections to connection tab
360 of ANT 315 and connection tab 365 of POST 320, in accordance with an embodiment of
the disclosure.
            [0042] In the illustrated embodiment, ANT 315 includes connection tab 360 for
electrically connecting to anterior contact pad 345 disposed on the front side of ring substrate
330. Correspondingly, POST 320 includes connection tab 365 for electrically connecting to
posterior contact pad 350 disposed on the backside of ring substrate 330. FIG. 5 illustrates the
use of conductive adhesive 405 to improve the electrically connections between connection tabs
360 and 365 and contact pads 345 and 350, respectively. Conductive adhesive 405 may be
implemented using a variety of different materials, such as, silver loaded epoxies, silicon, or
polyurethane, or otherwise. Conductive adhesive 405 provides flexible, conductive adhesion
that maintains electrical connection when the smart contact lens is bent or folded despite the
different flexibility characteristics of the various constituent parts of eye-mountable device 300.
            [0043] In the illustrated embodiment, connection tabs 360 and 365 are rotationally
offset relative to each other to make room for a through-substrate via for one or both of contact
pads 345, 365. For example, in the illustrated embodiment, power supply 335 and controller
circuit 340 are disposed on the front side of ring substrate 330, thus posterior contact pad 350 is
connected to controller circuit 340 using a through substrate via.
            [0044] FIG. 4C further illustrates the contour 410 of LC layer 325. LC layer 320 is
disposed between ANT 315 and POST 320 and is actuated by voltages applied across these
electrodes by controller circuit 340. In the illustrated embodiment, LC layer 320 extends across
a larger portion of the center region to ensure that ANT 315 and POST 320 do not short circuit
to each other. In one embodiment, transparent insulating layers (e.g., polyimide) may be applied
to separate LC layer 325 from ANT 315 and POST 320, while in other embodiments ANT 315
and POST320 may form direct contact with LC layer 325. Furthermore, both LC layer 320
along with ANT 315 and POST 320 are contained within the inner radius of ring substrate 330
and do not contact the inner edge of ring substrate 330. In one embodiment, ANT 315 and
1z1flqS5R11  1

                                                   12
POST 320 have a diameter of approximately 6 mm, LC layer 325 has a diameter of
approximately 7 mm, and the inner edge of ring substrate 330, which defines the center region,
has a diameter of 9 mm. The larger diameter of the inner edge of ring substrate 330 forms a gap
between ANT 315 and POST 320 to prevent shorting to ring substrate 330. Of course, other
dimensions may be implemented.
         [0045]   FIG. 6 is a flow chart illustrating a process 600 for fabricating eye-mountable
devices 100, 200, or 300, in accordance with an embodiment of the disclosure. The order in
which some or all of the process blocks appear in process 600 should not be deemed limiting.
Rather, one of ordinary skill in the art having the benefit of the present disclosure will
understand that some of the process blocks may be executed in a variety of orders not illustrated,
or even in parallel.
         [0046]   In process blocks 605 and 610, anterior layer 305 and posterior layer 310 are
formed as separate layers of the flexible lens enclosure. Anterior layer 305 and posterior layer
310 may be formed using molds that are spray coated or injected with a flexible, transparent
material. The flexible, transparent material may include any of a polymeric material, a
hydrogel, PMMA, silicone based polymers (e.g., fluoro-silicon acrylate), or otherwise.
         [0047]   In a process block 615, anterior layer 305 and posterior layer 310 are treated to
form reactive surfaces for improved bonding to the ANT 315 and POST 320. In one
embodiment, anterior layer 305 and posterior layer 310 are plasma treated in a highly ionizing
environment that causes the inside surfaces of anterior layer 305 and posterior layer 310 to be
chemically reactive.
         [0048]   In a process block 620, liquid conductor material that forms ANT 315 and
POST 320 is deposited onto the concave inside surface of anterior layer 305 and deposited onto
the convex inside surface of posterior layer 310. In one embodiment, the deposition of the
liquid conductor material may be spray coated over stencils that conform to the concave and
convex surfaces. In yet another embodiment, the liquid conductive material is applied to stamps
with curved surfaces that conform to the concave and convex surfaces of anterior layer 305 and
posterior layer 310, respectively. The coated stamps are then pressed against the inside surfaces
of anterior layer 305 and posterior layer 310 to transfer the ink pattern thereto. After application
of the liquid conductor material, it is cured and/or annealed with heat (process block 625).
         [0049]   In an embodiment where the liquid conductor material is a colloidal solution of
conductive particles (e.g., nanotubes or nanowires), the annealing can help the conductive
particles to lay or mat-down thereby improving the conductive characteristic of ANT 315 and
POST 320. Example commercially available materials for implementing the liquid conductor
1IfS51    1nI;R

                                                   13
material include silver nanowires, carbon nanotubes, PEDOT:PSS, or otherwise. In some
embodiments, various solvents (e.g., alcohol), surfactants, or dilutants may be added to the
liquid conductor material to improve the uniform coating and adhesion of ANT 315 and POST
320 to anterior layer 305 and posterior layer 310, respectively.
         [0050]   In some embodiments, several layers of the liquid conductor material is
iteratively applied and cured to build up the thickness of ANT 315 and POST 320 until a desired
sheet resistance is achieved (decision block 630). These iterations may range from a single
application to many applications (e.g., as many as 10 applications). However, one to four
iterative application and curing/annealing steps are expected to be sufficient in many instances.
         [0051]   In a process block 635, conductive adhesive 405 is applied to contact pads 345
and 350 on ring substrate 330. Next, ring substrate 330, including power supply 335 and
controller circuit 340, are positioned over the convex inside surface of posterior layer 310 with
posterior contact pad 350 aligning to connection tab 365 on POST 320 (process block 640).
         [0052]   In a process block 645, the liquid crystal material is dispensed into the center
region of the concave inside surface of anterior layer 305 and covers over ANT 315. In one
embodiment, the liquid crystal material is dispensed over a larger area such that LC layer 325
covers a greater area than either ANT 315 or POST 320.
         [0053]   In a process block 650, the two halves (anterior layer 305 and posterior layer
310) of the flexible lens enclosure are pressed together and sealed. When mating the two
halves, care is taken to ensure alignment between anterior connection tab 360 and anterior
contact pad 345. In one embodiment, additional flexible enclosure material is added to the
bottom edge or rim of the mated anterior layer 305 and posterior layer 310 to form the seal.
Finally, the eye-mountable device or smart contact lens is packaged into a sealed container of
lens solution for distribution.
