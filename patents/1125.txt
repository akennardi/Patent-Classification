     REMOTE LOCKING SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE AND USER INTERFACE
                                      Cross Reference to Related Application
               The present application claims the benefit of US Provisional Patent Application
   No. 15/393,878, filed 29 December 2016, which is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its
 5 entirety.
                                          Technical Field of the Invention
               The present invention relates generally to a locking system. More particularly, the present
   invention relates to a remote locking system for a storage unit.
                                           Background of the Invention
10             Toolboxes typically carry valuable or expensive items, such as tools, and are therefore
   locked or otherwise secured when not in use. Conventional toolbox locks are well known and
   include a simple lock and key mechanism to prevent theft or unauthorized access to the interior of
   the toolbox. Other locks include combination or digital keypad locks that receive input from a user
   to confirm the user is authorized to access the contents of the toolbox.
15             More recent developments in toolbox securement include remote activation of a lock. For
   example, U.S. Patent No. 8,720,239 (the "'239 Patent") includes an electromechanical actuator that
   locks or unlocks a toolbox. The actuator in the '239 Patent allows for either manual activation of the
   lock (e.g., in a conventional lock and key system) or wireless activation of the lock (e.g., with a
   remote actuator). When actuated, a lock bar causes the lock to maintain the toolbox in a locked,
20 closed position to prevent unauthorized individuals from accessing the toolbox contents.
               Recent developments has consolidated wireless devices into a smartphone for many
   purposes. Smartphone applications communicate to other electronic devices, or other smartphones,
   using the wireless technology within the phone itself. This wireless communication can be
   Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, cellular, radio, infrared, or any other form of communicative system.

                                            Summary of the Invention
               The present invention broadly comprises a remote locking system for a storage unit, for
   example a toolbox, that includes associated software to enable a user to use a mobile device (e.g.,
   smart phone) to remotely lock and unlock the storage unit. For example, the mobile device can
 5 include an application that provides locking and unlocking commands, locking status and tamper
   alerts for the storage unit. The system can include a proximity sensing feature so the storage unit is
   unlocked when an authenticated user is nearby, for example, when the user is within a certain
   proximity of or touches the storage unit. The storage unit can further include a timer or switch to
   disable communication between the mobile device and storage unit to reduce power consumption,
10 eliminate cross-talk or otherwise control when the storage unit can be accessed. A wireless
   transceiver, such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, cellular, or other, is disposed inside the storage unit for
   wireless communication, and a data storage medium can store a table of lock/unlock commands.,
   authentication codes with associated users and data logging, such as user access.
               In an embodiment, the present invention broadly includes a storage unit, such as a tool
15 storage unit or toolbox, having a housing for storing objects, a lock for maintaining the housing in a
   closed state when the lock is in the locked state, and for allowing access to the interior of the
   housing when the lock is in the unlocked state, a transceiver operably coupled to the lock and
   adapted to receive a lock command from a user device to cause the lock to enter either of the locked
   or unlocked states, and a sensor for sensing a proximity of a user device and communicating an
20 unlock signal to the lock if the user is authorized and within a preset proximity of the sensor.
               Further disclosed is a method for securing a storage unit, such as a tool storage unit or tool
   box, including providing a housing with a lock, the housing is adapted to house objects, such as
   tools, and the lock is adapted to maintain the housing in a closed, locked state to prevent access to
   the interior of the housing, or an unlocked state to allow access to the housing, receiving a lock

               While the present invention is susceptible of embodiments in many different forms, there is
   shown in the drawings, and will herein be described in detail, embodiments, including a preferred
   embodiment, of the invention with the understanding that the present disclosure is to be considered
   as an exemplification of the principles of the invention, and is not intended to limit the broad aspect
   96895421 (GHMatters) F107338AU

                                                        4
   of the invention to embodiments illustrated. As used herein, the term "present invention" is not
   intended to limit the scope of the claimed invention and is instead a term used to discuss exemplary
   embodiments of the invention for explanatory purposes only.
               The present invention broadly comprises a remote locking system for a storage unit, such as,
 5 for example, a tool storage unit, tool cabinet, or toolbox, that allows a user device that includes a
   security token, such as a smart phone or other mobile device, to remotely lock and unlock the
   storage unit. The user device can also include an application or other software that provides lock
   statuses, tamper alerts, lock commands, and open/closed statues for the storage unit. In an
   embodiment, the storage unit can include a proximity sensor so the unit is unlocked when an
10 authenticated user device is nearby or touches the storage unit. A timer can further be provided to
   disable communication between the user device and storage unit as a "sleep mode" that reduces
   cross-talk and power consumption and maintains a desired status of the storage unit independent of
   commands received from an authorized user device, such as, for example, providing access to the
   storage unit only during certain times of the day.
15             As shown in FIG. 1, in an embodiment, the present invention broadly includes a system 10
   can include a portable user device 100 that includes a security token, such as, for example, a smart
   phone, a smart watch, key fob, etc., a storage unit 105 for storing items, such as tools, and a
   network 110 having communication links 115 to operably couple the user device 100 to the storage
   unit 105. In an embodiment, a hub 120, such as a server, can be included as part of the system 10
20 and assist communication between the user device 100 and storage unit 105.
               The user device 100 can be a device of any type that includes a security token and allows
   wireless communication. By way of example, the user device 100 can include a smart phone (e.g.
   iPhone ), smart watch, key fob, personal computer, voice and video telephone set, streaming audio
   and video media player, integrated intelligent digital television receiver, work station, radio,
   96895421 (GHMatters) F107338.AU

                                                         5
   personal digital assistant (PDA), mobile satellite receiver, GPS receiver, software system, or any
   combination of the above. Further details of the user device 100 will be discussed below with
   respect to FIG. 2.
               The storage unit 105 can be any device or enclosure capable of enclosing tools or other
 5 objects. For example, the storage unit 105 can be a toolbox, tool cabinet, or can be any other
   enclosure, regardless of whether it is capable of holding tools. The storage unit 105 includes a
   housing for storing such objects.
               The network 110 may be a single network or a plurality of networks of the same or different
   type. For example, the network 110 may be a data network, a telephone network, an intranet,
10 Internet, cellular data network, Bluetooth, general packet radio service (GPRS), or a
   telecommunications network operably coupled to a data network. Any combination of
   telecommunications and data networks may be used without departing from the spirit and scope of
   the present invention.
               The communication links 115 can be any form of communicative link, whether wired or
15 wireless, between two or more objects. For example, the communication links 115 can be Wi-Fi,
   cellular, Bluetooth* , radio, or any other form of communication. For the purpose of discussion, the
   communication links 115 will be described as wireless, but the communication link 115 can also be
   a hard-wired functionality.
               As discussed above, the hub 120 can be a server. However, the hub 120 can be any device
20 capable of assisting communication between the user device 100 and storage unit 105. Further
   details of the hub 120 will be discussed below with respect to FIG. 4.
               Referring to FIG. 2, in an embodiment, the user device 100 includes a processor 125 for
   carrying out instructions stored on a storage medium 130, and a display 135 for displaying
   information to the user. The user device 100 can also include a transceiver 140 for sending and
   96895421 (GHMatters)F107338.AU

                                                        6
   receiving information, for example, communicating with the storage unit 105. An interface 145 can
   be provided for receiving commands from the user, and a power supply 150 can also be
   implemented to power the user device 100.
               The processor 125 facilitates communication between the various components of the user
 5 device 100 and between the user device 100 and other devices, such as the storage unit 105. The
   processor 125 can be any type of processor or processors that alone or in combination facilitate
   communication within the user device 100 and, together with the transceiver 140, transmit
   information from the user device 100 to external devices. For example, the processor 125 can be a
   desktop or mobile processor, a microprocessor, a single-core or a multi-core processor.
10             The storage medium 130 can be any non-transitory computer-readable recording medium
   capable of storing data. By way of example, and not limitation, the storage medium 130 can be a
   hard drive, DVD, CD, flash drive, volatile or non-volatile memory, RAM, or any other type of data
   storage. As used throughout this application, the term "non-transitory computer-readable recording
   medium" excludes only signals and carrier waves, per se, and is not meant to exclude other types of
15 memory that may be considered "transitory" such as RAM or other forms of volatile memory.
               The display 135 can display various information for the user to view and interpret, including
   information received from the storage unit 105 or hub 120, or requests to input information via the
   interface 145. By way of example, the display 135 can include a liquid crystal display (LCD),
   organic light emitting diode (OLED) display, plasma screen, cathode ray tube display, or any other
20 kind of black and white or color display that will allow the user to view information on the user
   device 100.
               The transceiver 140 can be any device that can transmit data from the user device 100 or can
   receive data within the user device 100 from an external data source. By way of example, the
   transceiver 140 can be any type of radio transmission antenna, cellular antenna, hardwired
   96895421 (GHMatters) F107338AU

                                                           7
   transceiver, or any other type of wired or wireless transceiver capable of communicating with an
   external device. As discussed herein, the user device 100 and storage unit 105 can communicate in
   any manner, for example, Wi-Fi, cellular, Bluetooth*, radio, remote keyless entry (RKE), public
   key cryptography (PKE), near field communication (NFC), ZigBee, or wired connection.
 5             The interface 145 can be any panel or screen capable of receiving information from the user
   and storing, transmitting, or interpreting such information. By way of example, and not limitation,
   the interface 145 can include a touch screen display, keyboard, voice recognition system, fingerprint
   recognition system, optical recognition system, proximity sensor, biometric indicia interface, or any
   other interface that allows the user to enter information into the system 10 and cause the system 10
10 to act based on that information.
               The power supply 150 can be any device capable of supplying the user device 100 with
   power. For example, the power supply 150 can be a lithium ion or nickel cadmium battery, fuel cell,
   wired power connection (e.g. conventional AC power), wireless power connection, or any other
   form of power supply capable of powering the components 125-145 of the user device 100. For the
15 purposes of discussion, the power supply 150 will be assumed to be a battery.
               FIG. 3 illustrates a storage unit 105 according to an embodiment of the present invention. In
   an embodiment, the storage unit 105 includes a transceiver 155 for communicating with external
   devices (for example, the user device 100), a storage medium 160 for storing data, and a sensor 165
   for sensing the proximity of user devices that respectively include authenticated security tokens.
20 Alternately, the user can enter information into a toolbox interface 170 to lock or unlock the storage
   unit 105. The storage unit 105 further includes a timer 175 for determining an amount of time in
   which the transceiver 155 has been inactive or has not received a communication from a user device
    100. A lock 180 is also implemented within the storage unit 105 to maintain the storage unit 105 in
   a closed state.
   96895421 (GHMatters)F107338.AU

                                                        8
               The toolbox transceiver 155 and storage medium 160 can be any device discussed above
   with respect to the transceiver 140 and storage medium 130, respectively. The toolbox transceiver
    155 communicates with external devices, for example., the user device 100. The toolbox transceiver
   155 can therefore receive a command from the security token in a user device 100 to unlock the
 5 lock 180. The command can be any form, for example, a signal from the user device 100 to lock or
   unlock the lock 180, or an indication of the proximity of the user device 100 as sensed by the sensor
   165. The toolbox transceiver 155 can also communicate information to the user device 100, such as
   a tamper alert and the users who recently unlocked the storage unit 105. In some embodiments, the
   toolbox transceiver 155 can be located inside the storage unit 105 to prevent unauthorized access
10 and tampering.
               The storage medium 160 can store any information helpful to the operation of the system 10.
   For example, the storage medium 160 can store a table identifying users who recently unlocked the
   storage unit 105, a list of identification numbers corresponding to authorized users, a time stamp for
   when the storage unit 105 was unlocked, a table for when the storage unit 105 was tampered with,
15 the type of input (e.g., manual, automatic, proximity sensor) that produced an unlock signal to the
   lock 180, or any other information.
               In an embodiment, the storage medium 160 can be operatively connected to the toolbox
   transceiver 155 so that information stored on the toolbox storage medium 160 can be transmitted to
   a remote device, such as the user device 100, and alert the user. For example, the storage medium
20  160 can store information relating to tamper attempts. Such information can include attempts by
   unauthorized individuals to access the storage unit 105 by attempting to disable the lock 180 in any
   manner. The user can therefore view a user device 100, where tamper information was previously
   sent from the storage unit 105 to the user device 100, and remotely determine whether the storage
   unit 105 has been tampered with. Additionally, the user can view the user device 100 and determine
   96895421 (GHMatters) F107338.AU

                                                           9
   a lock state of the storage unit 105 because the lock state can be stored in the storage medium 160
   and transmitted to the user device 100. Any other relevant information can be stored within the
   storage medium 160 and transmitted to the user device 100, or another external device, without
   departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention.
 5             The sensor 165 can be any type of sensor capable of sensing a proximity of a user. For
   example, the sensor 165 can be a proximity sensor that senses a user device having an authenticated
   security token within a certain proximity of the storage unit 105. The sensor 165 can sense the GPS
   coordinates of the user, or a more finite location of the user, in any known manner. For example, the
   sensor 165 can send a signal to the user device 100 and receive a signal from the user device 100
10 within a certain distance between the user device 100 and storage unit 105. When the user
   approaches the storage unit 105 within a certain predetermined distance. the storage unit 105 can
   sense the proximity of the user via the sensor 165, and. if the security token in the user device 100 is
   authenticated, automatically unlock the lock 180 without any action on the part of the user. In some
   embodiments, the sensor 165 can be a so-called "touch to open" sensor that senses the proximity of
15 the user and, if the user device 100 includes an authenticated security token, then touches a button
   or handle on the storage unit 105 after being sensed, the sensor 165 can cause the storage unit 105
   to enter the unlocked mode. The user can therefore unlock the storage unit 105 simply by having
   their smart phone in their pocket, and the user's hands can be free during the process.
               Alternately, or in addition to the above, the sensor 165 (or an additional sensor) can sense an
20 attempted tampering of the system 10. For example, the sensor 165 can sense if a user attempts to
   disable the lock 180 or transceivers 140, 155, 190. The user device 100 can then be alerted of such
   tampering, as discussed below in more detail. The sensor 165 could also determine whether the
   storage unit 105 is open or closed, so the storage unit 105 would only be locked if in the closed
   state. That is, the sensor 165 could determine whether the storage unit 105 is open or closed, and
   96895421 (GHMatters)F107338AU

                                                          10
   send a signal to allow the locking of the storage unit 105 only if the storage unit 105 is in the closed
   state. If the storage unit 105 is in the open state when a lock signal is received, the sensor 165 can
   cause or allow a signal to be sent to the user device 100 indicating the open status, and that the
   storage unit 105 was not locked.
 5             The storage unit 105 can also include a timer 175 for determining a time in which the lock
   180 is in an unlocked condition. The timer 175 determines the amount of time between locks and
   unlocks, and cause the lock 180 to automatically lock when the timer 175 reaches a predetermined
   time between the prior unlock signal. For example, the timer 175 can cause the lock 180 to enter the
   locked mode if the timer 175 determines it has been five minutes since the prior unlock signal. In an
10 embodiment, the storage unit 105 also includes sensors to determine the open/closed condition of
   the storage unit 105, to ensure that the lock is placed in the locked condition when the drawers to
   the storage unit 105 are closed. In this manner, the timer 175 can cause the lock 180 to lock if the
   user forgot to re-lock the lock 180 after an initial lock command. Further, the timer 175 can prevent
   unnecessary communication between the storage unit 105 and user device 100, or other devices, by
15 disabling the toolbox transceiver 155 after a predetermined amount of time since the prior unlock
   command. This process further eliminates cross-talk and unnecessary power usage, or maintain a
   locked condition regardless of authenticated user devices 100 nearby. Alternately, a switch can be
   provided to disable the toolbox transceiver 155 or lock the lock 180 so that any of the above
   objectives can be achieved in real time and without a timer 175.
20             FIG. 4 is a schematic illustration of a hub 120 according to an embodiment of the present
   invention. As discussed, the hub 120 can be a server that facilitates communication between the
   user device 100 and the storage unit 105. The hub 120 can also be a device located on or near the
   storage unit 105 and that provides indications to the user based on data stored, for example, in the
   storage medium 160 of the storage unit 105.

               As shown, the hub 120 includes a hub storage 185, a hub transceiver 190, and a hub power
   supply 197, which can be any device described above with respect to the storage medium 130,
   transceiver 140, and power supply 150, respectively. The hub transceiver 190 can communicate
   with the transceiver 140 of the user device 100 or the toolbox transceiver 155 of the storage unit
 5  105. The communicated information can be stored in the hub storage 185 and transmitted by the
   hub transceiver 190. Such information can include tamper attempts, a lock status of the storage unit
   105, a log of users who unlocked the storage unit 105, identification numbers or names of
   individuals authorized to unlock the storage unit, and others.
               The hub 120 can also include an indicator 197 that provides an indication to the user as to
10 any of the data above. The indicator 197 can be provided on the hub 120, or can be part of the
   storage unit 105 or user device 100 themselves. For example, the indicator 197 can provide a visual,
   audible, tactile, or other form of alert to a user. The indicator 197 can blink red, for instance, if the
   storage unit 105 has been tampered with. Any other manner of indication can be implemented
   without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention.
15             FIG. 5 is a flow chart of a process 500 for using the system 10 according to an embodiment
   of the present invention. The process 500 begins and proceeds to step 505, where a user logs in to
   their account. For example., a user may enter a user name and password for an account previously
   set up by either the user or an administrator of the system 10. The user can therefore be identified
   when logging in.
20             The process then proceeds to step 510 where the user transmits an open signal to the storage
   unit 105 so as to unlock the storage unit 105. In step 515, the storage unit 105 can record the unlock
   signal, and the identification of the user who transmitted the unlock signal, in a log of the storage
   unit 105. This information, as well as other information, can be transmitted to the user device in
   step 520.

               Step 525 determines whether a predetermined amount of time has elapsed since the prior
   communication between the hub 120/storage unit 105 and the user device 100. If a predetermined
   time has elapsed, the process proceeds to step 530, where the remote unlock feature is disabled. For
   example, the remote unlock feature can be disabled by disabling one of the transceivers 140, 155,
 5  190 if the timer 175 determines a predetermined amount of time has elapsed since a communication
   took place. If a predetermined time has not elapsed since communications, the process 500 reverts
   to just prior to step 525 and only advances to step 530 when no communications are received for a
   predetermined period. Following step 530, the process 500 can end.
               The present invention is discussed above with respect to locking or unlocking a storage unit
10  105. However, the storage unit 105 can have multiple drawers or sub-compartments that are
   individually or collectively secured. For example, a first user may have access to a first drawer with
   a first user device, a second user may have access to a second drawer with a second user device, and
   a third user may have access to all drawers with a third user device. Any other arrangement can be
   implemented without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention.
15             As discussed herein, the term "coupled" is intended to refer to any connection, direct or
   indirect, and is not limited to a direct connection between two or more elements of the disclosed
   invention. Similarly, "operatively coupled" is not intended to mean any direct connection, physical
   or otherwise, and is merely intended to define an arrangement where two or more elements
   communicate through some operative means (e.g., through conductive or convective heat transfer,
20 or otherwise). The term "coupled" can mean, in some embodiments., two objects being integral with
   one another.
               The matter set forth in the foregoing description and accompanying drawings is offered by
   way of illustration only and not as a limitation. While particular embodiments have been shown and
   described, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that changes and modifications may be made
