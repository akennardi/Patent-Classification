                             BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
[0003]           ST2 is a binding receptor for interleukin-33 (IL-33), a cytokine related to IL-I and
IL-18 and also known as NF-HEV or IL-IF11. ST2 is expressed as both a soluble non-signaling
variant (soluble ST2 or sST2) and a full-length membrane-spanning form (FL ST2, ST2 or
ST2L) that mediates cellular responses to IL-33. The latter form is expressed on a wide range of
cell types implicated in pathologic inflammation in a number of disease settings. These include
lymphocytes, particularly IL-5 and IL-13-expressing T helper cells, natural killer (NK) and
natural killer-T (NKT) cells, as well as many so-called innate immune cells, such as mast cells,
basophils, eosinophils, macrophages and innate helper cells (also known as nuocytes (Neill,
Wonget a]010)). IL-33 binding to ST2 on these cells leads to the recruitment of a broadly
expressed co-receptor known as the IL-IR Accessory Protein (AcP) and the activation of pro
inflammatory signaling, similar to IL-I and IL-18. IL-33 is thus able to directly activate ST2
expressing cells or enhance their activation when in the presence of other activating stimuli.
Examples of IL-33-induced cellular responses include the production of inflammatory cytokines,
such as IL-5, IL-6, IL-13, TNF, IFN-y and GM-CSF as well as the production of chemokines,
such as CXCL8, CCL17 and CCL24. IL-33 has also been shown to enhance acute allergic
responses by augmenting mast cell and basophil activation triggered by IgE receptor signaling or
other mast cell and basophil activators. IL-33 will also enhance the recruitment, survival and

adhesive properties of ST2 expressing immune cells and thus is important in provoking and
sustaining cellular inflammation in local tissues.
[0004]          The pro-inflammatory actions of IL-33 on innate and adaptive immune cells
culminate to promote a number of pathologic processes. In the lungs, these include increased
airway inflammation, mucus production, airway hyper responsiveness and fibrotic remodeling.
IL-33 can also contribute to localized inflammation in the joints as well as cutaneous and
articular hypernociception, by promoting the production of proinflammatory cytokines (VerrJi,
Guerrero et al. 2008; Xu. Jiang et al. 2008). Excessive IL-33 has been linked to pathologic
collagen deposition and fibrosis and also contributes to epithelial damage in the setting of
inflammatory bowel disease. Through its potent effects on basophils and IgE-sensitized mast
cells, IL-33 can also trigger anaphylactic shock (Pushparai, Tay et al. 2009) and may play a
contributing role in allergic disease. Many of these diseases are chronic and progressive in
nature and difficult to treat and there is a need for more effective treatments.
[00051          Consistent with its documented biologic effects, there are several lines of evidence
that the IL-33/ST2 pathway contributes to human disease. For example, abnormally high
expression of IL-33 is found in diseases involving inflammation in mucosal tissues and articular
inflammation. These include asthma (Prefontaine, Laioie-Kadoch et al. 2009; Prefontaine,
Nadigel et at2010), inflammatory bowel disease (Beitran, Nunez et al 2010; Pastorelikarget
al. 2010; Sponheim, Pollheimer et al. 2010) and rheumatoid arthritis (Palmer, Talabot-Ayer et al.
2009; Matsuvama, Okazaki et al. 2010). IL-33 expression is elevated in psoriatic skin
(Theoharides, Zhang et al. 2010) and the skin of atopic dermatitis patients (Pushparai, Tay et al.
2009) and is also increased in pathologic settings of fibrosis, such as systemic sclerosis (Yanaba,
Yoshizaki et al. 2011) (Manetti, Ibba-Manneschi et al. 2009) and liver fibrosis (Marvie,
Lisbonne et al. 2009). The concentration of circulating soluble ST2 is also elevated in numerous
disease situations, further indicating a link between this cytokine pathway and these diseases.
Examples include asthma (Kuroiwa, Arai et al. 2001; Oshikawa, Kuroiwa et al. 2001; Ali, Zhang
et al. 2009), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (H-Iacker._Lambers et al. 2009), pulmonary
fibrosis (Tajima, Oshikawa et al. 2003), sepsis and trauma (Brunner, Krenn et al. 2004), HIV
infection (Miyagaki, Sugaya et al. 2011), systemic lupus erythematosus (Mok, Huang et al.
2010), inflammatory bowel disease (BIeltran, N unez et al. 2010) as well as rheumatoid arthritis,
sclerosis, Wegener's granulomatosis and Behchet disease (Kuroiwa. Arai et al. 2001) and
cardiovascular disease (Shah and Januzzi 2010). IL-33 potentiates eosinophilic inflammation
and there is evidence this pathway is involved in eosinophil-associated disease, such as
                                                  -I?-

    WO 2013/173761                                                         PCT/US2013/041656
rhinosinusitis and nasal polyposis (Plager, Kahl et al. 2010) and eosinophilic bronchitis
(Oshikawa,_Kroiwa metal 2001).
[00061          Additional evidence linking the IL-33/ST2 pathway to human disease is provided
by genetic studies, which have identified IL-33 and/or ST2 gene polymorphisms in the general
population that are significantly associated with increased risk of disease or parameters of disease
severity. Several large genome-wide association studies have linked genetic variation in ST2
(ILIRLI) or IL-33 with increased risk of asthma (Gudbjartsson, Bjornsdottir et al. 2009; Moffatt,
Gut et al. 2010; Wu, Romieuetal. 2010) and other studies have genetically linked this pathway
to increased asthma severity (AliZang et al_2009) and bronchial hyper responsiveness
(Reiimerink, Postma et al. 2008). Similar findings have genetically implicated this pathway in
allergic disorders such as atopic dermatitis (Shimizu, iMatsuda et al. 2005), rhinosinusitis
(Sakashita, Yoshimoto et al. 2008; Castano R 2009) as well as nasal polyposis (Buysschaert,
Grulois et al. 2010).
[00071          Collectively, these links to several human diseases and the ability of this cytokine
axis to promote many forms of harmful inflammation imply this is a useful target for therapeutic
intervention.

         ST2 Antigen Binding Proteins
[00100]         The present invention provides antigen binding proteins that specifically bind
ST2. Embodiments of antigen binding proteins comprise peptides and/or polypeptides that
specifically bind ST2. Such peptides or polypeptides may optionally include one or more port
translational modifications. Embodiments of antigen binding proteins include antibodies and
fragments thereof, as variously defined herein, that specifically bind ST2. These include
antibodies that specifically bind human ST2, including those that inhibit IL-33 from binding
and/or activating ST2.
[00101]         The antigen binding proteins of the invention specifically bind to ST2.
"Specifically binds" as used herein means that the antigen binding protein preferentially binds
ST2 over other proteins. In some embodiments "specifically binds" means the ST2 antigen
binding protein has a higher affinity for ST2 than for other proteins. ST2 antigen binding
proteins that specifically bind ST2 may have a binding affinity for human ST2 of less than or
equal to 1 X 10-7 M, less than or equal to 2 x 10-7 M, less than or equal to 3 x 10-7 M, less than or
equal to 4 x 10-7 M, less than or equal to 5 x 10-7 M, less than or equal to 6 x 10-7 M, less than or

[00102]         Methods of measuring the binding affinity of an antigen binding protein are well
known in the art. Methods in common use for affinity determination include Surface Plasmon
Resonance (SPR) (Morton and Myszka "Kinetic analysis of macromolecular interactions using
surface plasmon resonance biosensors" Methods in Enzymology (1998) 295, 268-294), Bio-Layr
Interferometry, (Abdiche et al "Determining Kinetics and Affinities of Protein Interactions Using
a Parallel Real-time Label-free Biosensor, the Octet" Analytical Biochemistry (2008) 377, 209
217), Kinetic Exclusion Assay (KinExA) (Darling and Brault "Kinetic exclusion assay
technology: characterization of molecular interactions" Assay and Drug Dev Tech (2004) 2, 647
657), isothermal calorimetry (Pierce et al "Isothermal Titration Calorimetry of Protein-Protein
Interactions" Methods (1999) 19, 213-221) and analytical ultracentrifugation (Lebowitz et al
"Modern analytical ultracentrifugation in protein science: A tutorial review" ProteinScience
(2002), 11:2067-2079).      Example 3 provides exemplary methods.
[00103]         It is understood that when reference is made to the various embodiments of the
ST2-binding antibodies herein, that it also encompasses ST2-binding fragments thereof. An
ST2-binding fragment comprises any of the antibody fragments or domains described herein that
retains the ability to specifically bind to ST2. The ST2-binding fragment may be in any of the
scaffolds described herein.
[00104]         In certain therapeutic embodiments, an ST2 antigen binding protein inhibits
binding of ST2 to IL-33 and/or inhibits one or more biological activities associated with the
binding of ST2 to IL-33, e.g., IL-33-mediated signaling. Such antigen binding proteins are said
to be "neutralizing." In certain embodiments, the neutralizing ST2 antigen binding protein
specifically binds ST2 and inhibits binding of ST2 to IL-33 from anywhere between 10% to
100%, such as by at least about 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36,
37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62,

89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99% or more. For example, ST2 antigen binding proteins
may be tested for neutralizing ability by determining the ability of the antigen binding protein to
block binding of IL-33 to ST2 or IL-33 to co-receptors ST2 and AcP, see, e.g., the IL-33
blocking assays of Example 6. Alternatively, ST2 antigen binding proteins may be tested for
                                                 - IN -

neutralizing ability in an assay that measures the effect of the presence of the ST2 antigen
binding protein in an assay measuring an IL-33 mediated biological function. For example, the
ability of IL-33 to induce a biological response, such as intracellular signaling or increased
mRNA expression of mediators or secretion of mediators such as cytokines and chemokines from
cells such as eosinophils, basophils, T cells, mast cells, NK cells, NKT cells, neutrophils, or
innate helper cells. Alternatively, the ability of IL-33 to promote the differentiation, proliferation,
survival, chemotaxis, shape change or adhesive properties of cells such as eosinophils, basophils,
T cells, mast cells, NK cells, NKT cells, neutrophils, or innate helper cells. Alternatively, the
ability of IL-33 to induce cell surface expression of certain markers of cell activation, such as
CD1 Ib, on cells such as eosinophils, basophils, T cells, mast cells, NK cells, NKT cells,
neutrophils, or innate helper cells. Exemplary methods are provided in Examples 7-10.
[001051         Embodiments of antigen binding proteins comprise a scaffold structure, as
variously defined herein, with one or more complementarity determining regions (CDRs).
Embodiments further include antigen binding proteins comprising a scaffold structure with one
or more antibody variable domains, either heavy or light. Embodiments include antibodies that
comprise a light chain variable domain selected from the group consisting of AbI Light Chain
Variable Domain (LCv), Ab2 LCv, Ab3 LCv, Ab4 LCv, Ab5 LCv, Ab6 LCv, Ab7 LCv, Ab8

[00176]         In certain embodiments, the antigen binding protein comprises a light chain and/or
heavy chain CDR1. In some embodiments, the antigen binding protein comprises an amino acid

than two, no more than three, no more than four, no more than five, or no more than six amino
acid additions, deletions, or substitutions from the exemplary sequence set forth in SEQ ID NOS:

[001771         The antigen binding proteins of the invention comprise the scaffolds of traditional
antibodies, including human and monoclonal antibodies, bispecific antibodies, diabodies,
minibodies, domain antibodies, synthetic antibodies (sometimes referred to herein as "antibody
mimetics"), chimeric antibodies, antibody fusions (sometimes referred to as "antibody
conjugates"), and fragments of each, respectively. The above described CDRs, including various
combinations of the CDRs, may be grafted into any of the following scaffolds.
[00178]         As used herein, the term "antibody" refers to the various forms of monomeric or
multimeric proteins comprising one or more polypeptide chains that specifically binds to an

recombinant DNA techniques. In additional embodiments, antibodies are produced by enzymatic
or chemical cleavage of naturally occurring antibodies. In another aspect, the antibody is
selected from the group consisting of: a) a human antibody; b) a humanized antibody; c) a
chimeric antibody; d) a monoclonal antibody; e) a polyclonal antibody; f) a recombinant
antibody; g) an antigen-binding fragment; h) a single chain antibody; i) a diabody; j) a triabody,

[001791          A variable region or domain comprises at least three heavy or light chain CDRs
embedded within a framework region (designated framework regions FRI, FR2, FR3, and FR4).
Kabat et al., 1991, Sequences ofProteins ofImmunologicalInterest, Public Health Service
N.I.H., Bethesda, MD. Traditional antibody structural units typically comprise a tetramer. Each
tetramer is typically composed of two identical pairs of polypeptide chains, each pair having one
"light" and one "heavy" chain. The amino-terminal portion of each chain includes a variable
region of about 100 to 110 or more amino acids primarily responsible for antigen recognition.
The carboxy-terminal portion of each chain defines a constant region primarily responsible for
effector function. Human light chains are classified as kappa or lambda light chains. Heavy
chains are classified as mu, delta, gamma, alpha, or epsilon, and define the antibody's isotype as
IgM, IgD, IgG, IgA, and IgE, respectively. IgG has several subclasses, including, but not limited
to IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4. IgM has subclasses, including, but not limited to IgMI and
IgM2. Embodiments of the invention include all such classes and subclasses of antibodies that
incorporate a variable domain or CDR of the antigen binding proteins, as described herein.
[00180]          Some naturally occurring antibodies, such as those found in camels and llamas,
are dimers consisting of two heavy chains and include no light chains. The invention
encompasses dimeric antibodies of two heavy chains, or fragments thereof, that can bind to ST2.
[00181]          The variable regions of the heavy and light chains typically exhibit the same
general structure of relatively conserved framework regions (FR) joined by three hypervariable
regions, i.e., the complementarity determining regions or CDRs. The CDRs are primarily
responsible for antigen recognition and binding. The CDRs from the two chains of each pair are
aligned by the framework regions, enabling binding to a specific epitope. From N-terminal to C
terminal, both light and heavy chains comprise the domains FRI, CDR1, FR2, CDR2, FR3,
CDR3, and FR4. The assignment of amino acids to each domain is in accordance with the
definitions of Kabat.

    WO 2013/173761                                                         PCT/US2013/041656
[001821         CDRs constitute the major surface contact points for antigen binding. The CDR3
or the light chain and, particularly, CDR3 of the heavy chain may constitute the most important
determinants in antigen binding within the light and heavy chain variable regions. In some
antibodies, the heavy chain CDR3 appears to constitute the major area of contact between the
antigen and the antibody. In vitro selection schemes in which CDR3 alone is varied can be used
to vary the binding properties of an antibody or determine which residues contribute to the
binding of an antigen.
[001831         Naturally occurring antibodies typically include a signal sequence, which directs
the antibody into the cellular pathway for protein secretion and which is typically not present in
the mature antibody. A polynucleotide encoding an antibody of the invention may encode a
naturally occurring a signal sequence or a heterologous signal sequence as described below.
[00184]         In one embodiment, the antigen binding protein is an antibody comprising from
one to six of the exemplary CDRs described herein. The antibodies of the invention may be of
any type including IgM, IgG (including IgGI, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4), IgD, IgA, or IgE antibody. In
a specific embodiment the antigen binding protein is an IgG type antibody, e.g., a IgGI antibody.
[001851         In some embodiments, for example when the antigen binding protein is an
antibody with complete heavy and light chains, the CDRs are all from the same species, e.g.,
human. Alternatively, for example in embodiments wherein the antigen binding protein contains
less than six CDRs from the sequences outlined above, additional CDRs may be either from other
species or may be different human CDRs than those depicted in the exemplary sequences. For
example, HCDR3 and LCDR3 regions from the appropriate sequences identified herein may be
used with HCDR1, HCDR2, LCDR1, and LCDR2 being optionally selected from alternate
species or different human antibody sequences, or combinations thereof. For example, the CDRs
of the invention can replace the CDR regions of commercially relevant chimeric or humanized
antibodies.
[00186]         Specific embodiments utilize scaffold components of the antigen binding proteins
that are human components. In some embodiments, however, the scaffold components can be a
mixture from different species. As such, if the antigen binding protein is an antibody, such
antibody may be a chimeric antibody and/or humanized antibody. In general, both "chimeric
antibodies" and humanized antibodies" refer to antibodies that combine regions from more than
one species. For example, "chimeric antibodies" traditionally comprise variable region(s) from a
mouse (or rat, in some cases) and the constant region(s) from a human.
[001871         "Humanized antibodies" generally refer to non-human antibodies that have had
the variable domain framework regions swapped for sequences found in human antibodies.
                                               - 40-

    WO 2013/173761                                                         PCT/US2013/041656
Generally, in a humanized antibody, the entire antibody, except one or more CDRs, is encoded
by a polynucleotide of human origin or is identical to such an antibody except within one or more
CDRs. The CDRs, some or all of which are encoded by nucleic acids originating in a non-human
organism, are grafted into the beta-sheet framework of a human antibody variable region to
create an antibody, the specificity of which is determined by the engrafted CDRs. The creation
of such antibodies is described in, e.g., WO 92/11018, Jones 1986, Nature 321:522-525,
Verhoeyen et al., 1988, Science 239:1534-1536. Humanized antibodies can also be generated
using mice with a genetically engineered immune system. Roque et al., 2004, Biotechnol. Prog.
20:639-654. In the exemplary embodiments described herein, the identified CDRs are human,
and thus both humanized and chimeric antibodies in this context include some non-human CDRs;
for example, humanized antibodies may be generated that comprise the HCDR3 and LCDR3
regions, with one or more of the other CDR regions being of a different species origin.
[001881         In one embodiment, the ST2 antigen binding protein is a multispecific antibody,
and notably a bispecfic antibody, also sometimes referred to as "diabodies." These are antibodies
that bind to two or more different antigens or different epitopes on a single antigen. In certain
embodiments, a bispecific antibody binds ST2 and an antigen on a human effector cell (e.g., T
cell). Such antibodies are useful in targeting an effector cell response against a ST2 expressing
cells, such as an ST2-expressing tumor cell. In preferred embodiments, the human effector cell
antigen is CD3. U.S. Pat. No. 7,235,641. Methods of making bispecific antibodies are known in
the art. One such method involves engineering the Fc portion of the heavy chains such as to
create "knobs" and "holes" which facilitate heterodimer formation of the heavy chains when co
expressed in a cell. U.S. 7,695,963. Another method also involves engineering the Fc portion of
the heavy chain but uses electrostatic steering to encourage heterodimer formation while
discouraging homodimer formation of the heavy chains when co-expressed in a cell. WO
09/089,004, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
[001891         In one embodiment, the ST2 antigen binding protein is a minibody. Minibodies
are minimized antibody-like proteins comprising a scFv joined to a CH3 domain. Hu et al.,
1996, CancerRes. 56:3055-3061.
[00190]         In one embodiment, the ST2 antigen binding protein is a domain antibody; see, for
example U.S. Patent No. 6,248,516. Domain antibodies (dAbs) are functional binding domains
of antibodies, corresponding to the variable regions of either the heavy (VH) or light (VL) chains
of human antibodies. dABs have a molecular weight of approximately 13 kDa, or less than one
tenth the size of a full antibody. dABs are well expressed in a variety of hosts including
bacterial, yeast, and mammalian cell systems. In addition, dAbs are highly stable and retain

activity even after being subjected to harsh conditions, such as freeze-drying or heat
denaturation. See, for example, US Patent 6,291,158; 6,582,915; 6,593,081; 6,172,197; US

W004/003019 and W003/002609.
[00191]          In one embodiment, the ST2 antigen binding protein is an antibody fragment, that
is a fragment of any of the antibodies outlined herein that retain binding specificity to ST2. In
various embodiments, the antibody binding proteins comprise, but are not limited to, a F(ab),
F(ab'), F(ab')2, Fv, or a single chain Fv fragments. At a minimum, an antibody, as meant herein,
comprises a polypeptide that can bind specifically to ST2 comprising all or part of a light or
heavy chain variable region, such as one or more CDRs.
[00192]          Further examples of ST2-binding antibody fragments include, but are not limited
to, (i) the Fab fragment consisting of VL, VH, CL and CHI domains, (ii) the Fd fragment
consisting of the VH and CHI domains, (iii) the Fv fragment consisting of the VL and VH
domains of a single antibody; (iv) the dAb fragment (Ward et al., 1989, Nature 341:544-546)
which consists of a single variable, (v) isolated CDR regions, (vi) F(ab') 2 fragments, a bivalent
fragment comprising two linked Fab fragments (vii) single chain Fv molecules (scFv), wherein a
VH domain and a VL domain are linked by a peptide linker which allows the two domains to
associate to form an antigen binding site (Bird et al., 1988, Science 242:423-426, Huston et al.,
1988, Proc.Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 85:5879-5883), (viii) bispecific single chain Fv dimers
(PCT/US92/09965) and (ix) "diabodies" or "triabodies", multivalent or multispecific fragments
constructed by gene fusion (Tomlinson et. al., 2000, Methods Enzymol. 326:461-479;
W094/13804; Holliger et al., 1993, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 90:6444-6448). The antibody
fragments may be modified. For example, the molecules may be stabilized by the incorporation
of disulphide bridges linking the VH and VL domains (Reiter et al., 1996, Nature Biotech.
14:1239-1245). Aspects of the invention include embodiments wherein the non-CDR
components of these fragments are human sequences.
[00193]          In one embodiment, the ST2 antigen binding protein is a fully human antibody. In
this embodiment, as outlined above, specific structures comprise complete heavy and light chains
depicted comprising the CDR regions. Additional embodiments utilize one or more of the CDRs
of the invention, with the other CDRs, framework regions, J and D regions, constant regions, etc.,
coming from other human antibodies. For example, the CDRs of the invention can replace the
CDRs of any number of human antibodies, particularly commercially relevant antibodies
[00194]          Single chain antibodies may be formed by linking heavy and light chain variable
domain (Fv region) fragments via an amino acid bridge (short peptide linker), resulting in a

single polypeptide chain. Such single-chain Fvs (scFvs) have been prepared by fusing DNA
encoding a peptide linker between DNAs encoding the two variable domain polypeptides (VL
and VH). The resulting polypeptides can fold back on themselves to form antigen-binding
monomers, or they can form multimers (e.g., dimers, trimers, or tetramers), depending on the
length of a flexible linker between the two variable domains (Kortt et al., 1997, Prot. Eng.
10:423; Kortt et al., 2001, Biomol. Eng. 18:95-108). By combining different VL and VH
comprising polypeptides, one can form multimeric scFvs that bind to different epitopes
(Kriangkum et al., 2001, Biomol. Eng. 18:31-40). Techniques developed for the production of
single chain antibodies include those described in U.S. Patent No. 4,946,778; Bird, 1988, Science
242:423; Huston et al., 1988, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85:5879; Ward et al., 1989, Nature

[001951         In one embodiment, the ST2 antigen binding protein is an antibody fusion protein
(sometimes referred to herein as an "antibody conjugate"). The conjugate partner can be
proteinaceous or non-proteinaceous; the latter generally being generated using functional groups
on the antigen binding protein and on the conjugate partner. In certain embodiments, the
antibody is conjugated to a non-proteinaceous chemical (drug) to form an antibody drug
conjugate.
[00196]         In one embodiment, the ST2 antigen binding protein is an antibody analog,
sometimes referred to as "synthetic antibodies." For example, a variety of work utilizes either
alternative protein scaffolds or artificial scaffolds with grafted CDRs. Such scaffolds include,
but are not limited to, mutations introduced to stabilize the three-dimensional structure of the
binding protein as well as wholly synthetic scaffolds consisting for example of biocompatible
polymers. See, for example, Korndorfer et al., 2003, Proteins:Structure, Function, and
                                                  - 41-

Bioinformatics,Volume 53, Issue 1:121-129. Roque et al., 2004, Biotechnol. Prog. 20:639-654.
In addition, peptide antibody mimetics ("PAMs") can be used, as well as work based on antibody
mimetics utilizing fibronection components as a scaffold.
[001971           By "protein," as used herein, is meant at least two covalently attached amino
acids, which includes proteins, polypeptides, oligopeptides and peptides. In some embodiments,
the two or more covalently attached amino acids are attached by a peptide bond. The protein
may be made up of naturally occurring amino acids and peptide bonds, for example when the
protein is made recombinantly using expression systems and host cells, as outlined below.
Alternatively, the protein may include synthetic amino acids (e.g., homophenylalanine, citrulline,
ornithine, and norleucine), or peptidomimetic structures, i.e., "peptide or protein analogs", such
as peptoids (see, Simon et al., 1992, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 89:9367, incorporated by
reference herein), which can be resistant to proteases or other physiological and/or storage
conditions. Such synthetic amino acids may be incorporated in particular when the antigen
binding protein is synthesized in vitro by conventional methods well known in the art. In
addition, any combination of peptidomimetic, synthetic and naturally occurring
residues/structures can be used. "Amino acid" also includes imino acid residues such as proline
and hydroxyproline. The amino acid "R group" or "side chain" may be in either the (L)- or the
(S)-configuration. In a specific embodiment, the amino acids are in the (L)- or (S)-configuration.
[00198]           In certain aspects, the invention provides recombinant antigen binding proteins
that bind ST2 and, in some embodiments, a recombinant human ST2 or portion thereof. In this
context, a "recombinant protein" is a protein made using recombinant techniques using any
techniques and methods known in the art, i.e., through the expression of a recombinant nucleic
acid as described herein. Methods and techniques for the production of recombinant proteins are
well known in the art. Embodiments of the invention include recombinant antigen binding
proteins that bind wild-type ST2 and variants thereof.
[00199]           "Consisting essentially of' means that the amino acid sequence can vary by about
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, or 15% relative to the recited SEQ ID NO: sequence
and still retain biological activity, as described herein.
[00200]           In some embodiments, the antigen binding proteins of the invention are isolated
proteins or substantially pure proteins. An "isolated" protein is unaccompanied by at least some
of the material with which it is normally associated in its natural state, for example constituting at
least about 5%, or at least about 50% by weight of the total protein in a given sample. It is
understood that the isolated protein may constitute from 5 to 99.9% by weight of the total protein
content depending on the circumstances. For example, the protein may be made at a significantly

higher concentration through the use of an inducible promoter or high expression promoter, such
that the protein is made at increased concentration levels. The definition includes the production
of an antigen binding protein in a wide variety of organisms and/or host cells that are known in
the art.
[00201]         For amino acid sequences, sequence identity and/or similarity is determined by
using standard techniques known in the art, including, but not limited to, the local sequence
identity algorithm of Smith and Waterman, 1981, Adv. Apple. Math. 2:482, the sequence identity
alignment algorithm of Needleman and Wunsch, 1970, J. Mol. Biol. 48:443, the search for
similarity method of Pearson and Lipman, 1988, Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 85:2444,

the Wisconsin Genetics Software Package, Genetics Computer Group, 575 Science Drive,
Madison, Wis.), the Best Fit sequence program described by Devereux et al., 1984, Nucl. Acid
Res. 12:387-395, preferably using the default settings, or by inspection. Preferably, percent
identity is calculated by FastDB based upon the following parameters: mismatch penalty of 1;
gap penalty of 1; gap size penalty of 0.33; and joining penalty of 30, "Current Methods in
Sequence Comparison and Analysis," Macromolecule Sequencing and Synthesis, Selected
Methods and Applications, pp 127-149 (1988), Alan R. Liss, Inc.
[00202]         An example of a useful algorithm is PILEUP. PILEUP creates a multiple
sequence alignment from a group of related sequences using progressive, pairwise alignments. It
can also plot a tree showing the clustering relationships used to create the alignment. PILEUP
uses a simplification of the progressive alignment method of Feng & Doolittle, 1987, J. Mol.
Evol. 35:351-360; the method is similar to that described by Higgins and Sharp, 1989, CABIOS
5:151-153. Useful PILEUP parameters including a default gap weight of 3.00, a default gap
length weight of 0.10, and weighted end gaps.
[00203]         Another example of a useful algorithm is the BLAST algorithm, described in:
Altschul et al., 1990, J. Mol. Biol. 215:403-410; Altschul et al., 1997, Nucleic Acids Res.
25:3389-3402; and Karin et al., 1993, Proc.Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 90:5873-5787. A particularly
useful BLAST program is the WU-BLAST-2 program which was obtained from Altschul et al.,
1996, Methods in Enzymology 266:460-480. WU-BLAST-2 uses several search parameters,
most of which are set to the default values. The adjustable parameters are set with the following

the sequence of interest is being searched; however, the values may be adjusted to increase
sensitivity.
[00204]         An additional useful algorithm is gapped BLAST as reported by Altschul et al.,
1993, Nucl. Acids Res. 25:3389-3402. Gapped BLAST uses BLOSUM-62 substitution scores;
threshold T parameter set to 9; the two-hit method to trigger ungapped extensions, charges gap
lengths of k a cost of 10+k; Xu set to 16, and Xg set to 40 for database search stage and to 67 for
the output stage of the algorithms. Gapped alignments are triggered by a score corresponding to
about 22 bits.
[002051         Generally, the amino acid homology, similarity, or identity between individual
variant CDRs are at least 80% to the sequences depicted herein, and more typically with
preferably increasing homologies or identities of at least 85%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%,
96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, and almost 100%. In a similar manner, "percent (%) nucleic acid
sequence identity" with respect to the nucleic acid sequence of the binding proteins identified
herein is defined as the percentage of nucleotide residues in a candidate sequence that are
identical with the nucleotide residues in the coding sequence of the antigen binding protein. A
specific method utilizes the BLASTN module of WU-BLAST-2 set to the default parameters,
with overlap span and overlap fraction set to 1 and 0.125, respectively.
[00206]         Generally, the nucleic acid sequence homology, similarity, or identity between the
nucleotide sequences encoding individual variant CDRs and the nucleotide sequences depicted
herein are at least 80%, and more typically with preferably increasing homologies or identities of
at least 80%, 81%, 82%, 83%, 84%, 85%, 86%, 87%,         8 8 %, 8 9              9 2 %, 93%,

95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99%, and almost 100%.
[002071         Thus, a "variant CDR" is one with the specified homology, similarity, or identity
to the parent CDR of the invention, and shares biological function, including, but not limited to,
at least 80%, 81%, 82%, 83%, 84%, 85%, 86%, 87%, 88%, 89%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%,
95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99% of the specificity and/or activity of the parent CDR.
[00208]         While the site or region for introducing an amino acid sequence variation is
predetermined, the mutation per se need not be predetermined. For example, in order to optimize
the performance of a mutation at a given site, random mutagenesis may be conducted at the
target codon or region and the expressed antigen binding protein CDR variants screened for the
optimal combination of desired activity. Techniques for making substitution mutations at
predetermined sites in DNA having a known sequence are well known, for example, M13 primer
mutagenesis and PCR mutagenesis. Screening of the mutants is done using assays of antigen
binding protein activities, such as ST2 binding.

[00209]          Amino acid substitutions are typically of single residues; insertions usually will be
on the order of from about one (1) to about twenty (20) amino acid residues, although
considerably larger insertions may be tolerated. Deletions range from about one (1) to about
twenty (20) amino acid residues, although in some cases deletions may be much larger.
[00210]          Substitutions, deletions, insertions or any combination thereof may be used to
arrive at a final derivative or variant. Generally these changes are done on a few amino acids to
minimize the alteration of the molecule, particularly the immunogenicity and specificity of the
antigen binding protein. However, larger changes may be tolerated in certain circumstances.
Conservative substitutions are generally made in accordance with the following chart depicted as

[00211]          Substantial changes in function or immunological identity are made by selecting
substitutions that are less conservative than those shown in TABLE 3. For example, substitutions
may be made which more significantly affect: the structure of the polypeptide backbone in the
area of the alteration, for example the alpha-helical or beta-sheet structure; the charge or
hydrophobicity of the molecule at the target site; or the bulk of the side chain. The substitutions
which in general are expected to produce the greatest changes in the polypeptide's properties are
those in which (a) a hydrophilic residue, e.g., seryl or threonyl, is substituted for (or by) a
hydrophobic residue, e.g., leucyl, isoleucyl, phenylalanyl, valyl or alanyl; (b) a cysteine or

proline is substituted for (or by) any other residue; (c) a residue having an electropositive side
chain, e.g., lysyl, arginyl, or histidyl, is substituted for (or by) an electronegative residue, e.g.,
glutamyl or aspartyl; or (d) a residue having a bulky side chain, e.g., phenylalanine, is substituted
for (or by) one not having a side chain, e.g., glycine.
[00212]          The variants typically exhibit the same qualitative biological activity and will
elicit the same immune response as the naturally-occurring analogue, although variants also are
selected to modify the characteristics of the antigen binding protein proteins as needed.
Alternatively, the variant may be designed such that the biological activity of the antigen binding
protein is altered. For example, glycosylation sites may be altered or removed as discussed
herein.
[00213]          Other derivatives of ST2 antibodies within the scope of this invention include
covalent or aggregative conjugates of ST2 antibodies, or fragments thereof, with other proteins or
polypeptides, such as by expression of recombinant fusion proteins comprising heterologous
polypeptides fused to the N-terminus or C-terminus of a ST2 antibody polypeptide. For example,
the conjugated peptide may be a heterologous signal (or leader) polypeptide, e.g., the yeast alpha
factor leader, or a peptide such as an epitope tag. ST2 antibody-containing fusion proteins can
comprise peptides added to facilitate purification or identification of the ST2 antibody (e.g., poly
His). A ST2 antibody polypeptide also can be linked to the FLAG peptide as described in Hopp
et al., Bio/Technology 6:1204, 1988, and U.S. Patent 5,011,912. The FLAG peptide is highly
antigenic and provides an epitope reversibly bound by a specific monoclonal antibody (mAb),
enabling rapid assay and facile purification of expressed recombinant protein. Reagents useful
for preparing fusion proteins in which the FLAG peptide is fused to a given polypeptide are
commercially available (Sigma, St. Louis, MO).
[00214]          In one embodiment, an oligomer is prepared using polypeptides derived from
immunoglobulins. Preparation of fusion proteins comprising certain heterologous polypeptides
fused to various portions of antibody-derived polypeptides (including the Fc domain) has been
described, e.g., by Ashkenazi et al., 1991, PNAS USA 88:10535; Byrn et al., 1990, Nature
344:677; and Hollenbaugh et al., 1992 "Construction of Immunoglobulin Fusion Proteins", in
CurrentProtocolsin Immunology, Suppl. 4, pages 10.19.1 - 10.19.11.
[002151          One embodiment of the present invention is directed to a dimer comprising two
fusion proteins created by fusing a ST2 binding fragment of a ST2 antibody to the Fc region of
an antibody. The dimer can be made by, for example, inserting a gene fusion encoding the fusion
protein into an appropriate expression vector, expressing the gene fusion in host cells
transformed with the recombinant expression vector, and allowing the expressed fusion protein to

    WO 2013/173761                                                         PCT/US2013/041656
assemble much like antibody molecules, whereupon interchain disulfide bonds form between the
Fc moieties to yield the dimer.
[002161         The term "Fc polypeptide" as used herein includes native and mutein forms of
polypeptides derived from the Fc region of an antibody. Truncated forms of such polypeptides
containing the hinge region that promotes dimerization also are included. Fusion proteins
comprising Fc moieties (and oligomers formed therefrom) offer the advantage of facile
purification by affinity chromatography over Protein A or Protein G columns.
[002171         One suitable Fc polypeptide, described in PCT application WO 93/10151 (hereby
incorporated by reference), is a single chain polypeptide extending from the N-terminal hinge
region to the native C-terminus of the Fc region of a human IgG antibody. Another useful Fc
polypeptide is the Fc mutein described in U.S. Patent 5,457,035 and in Baum et al., 1994, EMBO
J. 13:3992-4001. The amino acid sequence of this mutein is identical to that of the native Fc
sequence presented in WO 93/10151, except that amino acid 19 has been changed from Leu to
Ala, amino acid 20 has been changed from Leu to Glu, and amino acid 22 has been changed from
Gly to Ala. The mutein exhibits reduced affinity for Fc receptors.
[00218]         In other embodiments, the variable portion of the heavy and/or light chains of a
ST2 antibody may be substituted for the variable portion of an antibody heavy and/or light chain.
[00219]         Another method for preparing oligomeric ST2 antibody derivatives involves use
of a leucine zipper. Leucine zipper domains are peptides that promote oligomerization of the
proteins in which they are found. Leucine zippers were originally identified in several DNA
binding proteins (Landschulz et al., 1988, Science 240:1759), and have since been found in a
variety of different proteins. Among the known leucine zippers are naturally occurring peptides
and derivatives thereof that dimerize or trimerize. Examples of leucine zipper domains suitable
for producing soluble oligomeric proteins are described in PCT application WO 94/10308, and
the leucine zipper derived from lung surfactant protein D (SPD) described in Hoppe et al., 1994,
FEBS Letters 344:191, hereby incorporated by reference. The use of a modified leucine zipper
that allows for stable trimerization of a heterologous protein fused thereto is described in
Fanslow et al., 1994, Semin. Immunol. 6:267-78. In one approach, recombinant fusion proteins
comprising ST2 antibody fragment or derivative fused to a leucine zipper peptide are expressed
in suitable host cells, and the soluble oligomeric ST2 antibody fragments or derivatives that form
are recovered from the culture supernatant.
[00220]         Covalent modifications of antigen binding proteins are included within the scope
of this invention, and are generally, but not always, done post-translationally. For example,
several types of covalent modifications of the antigen binding protein are introduced into the
                                                 - 49 -

    WO 2013/173761                                                           PCT/US2013/041656
molecule by reacting specific amino acid residues of the antigen binding protein with an organic
derivatizing agent that is capable of reacting with selected side chains or the N- or C-terminal
residues.
[00221]         Cysteinyl residues most commonly are reacted with a-haloacetates (and
corresponding amines), such as chloroacetic acid or chloroacetamide, to give carboxymethyl or
carboxyamidomethyl derivatives. Cysteinyl residues also are derivatized by reaction with
bromotrifluoroacetone, a-bromo-p-(5-imidozoyl)propionic acid, chloroacetyl phosphate, N
alkylmaleimides, 3-nitro-2-pyridyl disulfide, methyl 2-pyridyl disulfide, p
chloromercuribenzoate, 2-chloromercuri-4-nitrophenol, or chloro-7-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3
diazole.
[00222]         Histidyl residues are derivatized by reaction with diethylpyrocarbonate at pH 5.5
7.0 because this agent is relatively specific for the histidyl side chain. Para-bromophenacyl
bromide also is useful; the reaction is preferably performed in 0. 1M sodium cacodylate at pH 6.0.
[00223]         Lysinyl and amino terminal residues are reacted with succinic or other carboxylic
acid anhydrides. Derivatization with these agents has the effect of reversing the charge of the
lysinyl residues. Other suitable reagents for derivatizing alpha-amino-containing residues
include imidoesters such as methyl picolinimidate; pyridoxal phosphate; pyridoxal;
chloroborohydride; trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid; O-methylisourea; 2,4-pentanedione; and
transaminase-catalyzed reaction with glyoxylate.
[00224]         Arginyl residues are modified by reaction with one or several conventional
reagents, among them phenylglyoxal, 2,3-butanedione, 1,2-cyclohexanedione, and ninhydrin.
Derivatization of arginine residues requires that the reaction be performed in alkaline conditions
because of the high pKa of the guanidine functional group. Furthermore, these reagents may
react with the groups of lysine as well as the arginine epsilon-amino group.
[002251         The specific modification of tyrosyl residues may be made, with particular interest
in introducing spectral labels into tyrosyl residues by reaction with aromatic diazonium
compounds or tetranitromethane. Most commonly, N-acetylimidizole and tetranitromethane are
used to form O-acetyl tyrosyl species and 3-nitro derivatives, respectively. Tyrosyl residues are
iodinated using mI or mI to prepare labeled proteins for use in radioimmunoassay, the
chloramine T method described above being suitable.
[00226]         Carboxyl side groups (aspartyl or glutamyl) are selectively modified by reaction
with carbodiimides (R'-N=C=N--R'), where R and R' are optionally different alkyl groups, such
as 1-cyclohexyl-3-(2-morpholinyl-4-ethyl) carbodiimide or 1-ethyl-3-(4-azonia-4,4

dimethylpentyl) carbodiimide. Furthermore, aspartyl and glutamyl residues are converted to
asparaginyl and glutaminyl residues by reaction with ammonium ions.
[002271          Derivatization with bifunctional agents is useful for crosslinking antigen binding
proteins to a water-insoluble support matrix or surface for use in a variety of methods.
Commonly used crosslinking agents include, e.g., 1,1 -bis(diazoacetyl)-2-phenylethane,
glutaraldehyde, N-hydroxysuccinimide esters, for example, esters with 4-azidosalicylic acid,
homobifunctional imidoesters, including disuccinimidyl esters such as 3,3'
dithiobis(succinimidylpropionate), and bifunctional maleimides such as bis-N-maleimido-1,8
octane. Derivatizing agents such as methyl-3-[(p-azidophenyl)dithio]propioimidate yield
photoactivatable intermediates that are capable of forming crosslinks in the presence of light.
Alternatively, reactive water-insoluble matrices such as cyanogen bromide-activated
carbohydrates and the reactive substrates described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,969,287; 3,691,016;
4,195,128; 4,247,642; 4,229,537; and 4,330,440 are employed for protein immobilization.
[00228]          Glutaminyl and asparaginyl residues are frequently deamidated to the
corresponding glutamyl and aspartyl residues, respectively. Alternatively, these residues are
deamidated under mildly acidic conditions. Either form of these residues falls within the scope
of this invention.
[00229]          Other modifications include hydroxylation of proline and lysine, phosphorylation
of hydroxyl groups of seryl or threonyl residues, methylation of the a-amino groups of lysine,
arginine, and histidine side chains (T. E. Creighton, Proteins: Structure and Molecular Properties,
W. H. Freeman & Co., San Francisco, 1983, pp. 79-86), acetylation of the N-terminal amine, and
amidation of any C-terminal carboxyl group.
[00230]          Another type of covalent modification of the antigen binding protein included
within the scope of this invention comprises altering the glycosylation pattern of the protein. As
is known in the art, glycosylation patterns can depend on both the sequence of the protein (e.g.,
the presence or absence of particular glycosylation amino acid residues, discussed below), or the
host cell or organism in which the protein is produced. Particular expression systems are
discussed below.
[00231]          Glycosylation of polypeptides is typically either N-linked or O-linked. N-linked
refers to the attachment of the carbohydrate moiety to the side chain of an asparagine residue.
The tri-peptide sequences asparagine-X-serine and asparagine-X-threonine, where X is any
amino acid except proline, are the recognition sequences for enzymatic attachment of the
carbohydrate moiety to the asparagine side chain. Thus, the presence of either of these tri
peptide sequences in a polypeptide creates a potential glycosylation site. O-linked glycosylation
                                                - 51 -

    WO 2013/173761                                                          PCT/US2013/041656
refers to the attachment of one of the sugars N-acetylgalactosamine, galactose, or xylose, to a
hydroxyamino acid, most commonly serine or threonine, although 5-hydroxyproline or 5
hydroxylysine may also be used.
[00232]          Addition of glycosylation sites to the antigen binding protein is conveniently
accomplished by altering the amino acid sequence such that it contains one or more of the above
described tri-peptide sequences (for N-linked glycosylation sites). The alteration may also be
made by the addition of, or substitution by, one or more serine or threonine residues to the
starting sequence (for O-linked glycosylation sites). For ease, the antigen binding protein amino
acid sequence is preferably altered through changes at the DNA level, particularly by mutating
the DNA encoding the target polypeptide at preselected bases such that codons are generated that
will translate into the desired amino acids.
[00233]          Another means of increasing the number of carbohydrate moieties on the antigen
binding protein is by chemical or enzymatic coupling of glycosides to the protein. These
procedures are advantageous in that they do not require production of the protein in a host cell
that has glycosylation capabilities for N- and O-linked glycosylation. Depending on the coupling
mode used, the sugar(s) may be attached to (a) arginine and histidine, (b) free carboxyl groups,
(c) free sulfhydryl groups such as those of cysteine, (d) free hydroxyl groups such as those of
serine, threonine, or hydroxyproline, (e) aromatic residues such as those of phenylalanine,
tyrosine, or tryptophan, or (f) the amide group of glutamine. These methods are described in WO
87/05330 published Sep. 11, 1987, and in Aplin and Wriston, 1981, CRC Crit.Rev. Biochem.,
pp. 259-306.
[00234]          Removal of carbohydrate moieties present on the starting antigen binding protein
may be accomplished chemically or enzymatically. Chemical deglycosylation requires exposure
of the protein to the compound trifluoromethanesulfonic acid, or an equivalent compound. This
treatment results in the cleavage of most or all sugars except the linking sugar (N
acetylglucosamine or N-acetylgalactosamine), while leaving the polypeptide intact. Chemical
deglycosylation is described by Hakimuddin et al., 1987, Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 259:52 and by
Edge et al., 1981, Anal. Biochem. 118:131. Enzymatic cleavage of carbohydrate moieties on
polypeptides can be achieved by the use of a variety of endo- and exo-glycosidases as described
by Thotakura et al., 1987, Meth. Enzymol. 138:350. Glycosylation at potential glycosylation
sites may be prevented by the use of the compound tunicamycin as described by Duskin et al.,
1982, J. Biol. Chem. 257:3105. Tunicamycin blocks the formation of protein-N-glycoside
linkages.

[002351          Another type of covalent modification of the antigen binding protein comprises
linking the antigen binding protein to various nonproteinaceous polymers, including, but not
limited to, various polyols such as polyethylene glycol, polypropylene glycol or
polyoxyalkylenes, in the manner set forth in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,640,835; 4,496,689; 4,301,144;
4,670,417; 4,791,192 or 4,179,337. In addition, as is known in the art, amino acid substitutions
may be made in various positions within the antigen binding protein to facilitate the addition of
polymers such as PEG.
[00236]          In some embodiments, the covalent modification of the antigen binding proteins
of the invention comprises the addition of one or more labels.
[002371          The term "labeling group" means any detectable label. Examples of suitable
labeling groups include, but are not limited to, the following: radioisotopes or radionuclides (e.g.,
3H,  1CN,    ,5   , 90, 99Tc, mIn,       1 131), fluorescent groups (e.g., FITC, rhodamine, lanthanide
phosphors), enzymatic groups (e.g., horseradish peroxidase,          -galactosidase, luciferase, alkaline
phosphatase), chemiluminescent groups, biotinyl groups, or predetermined polypeptide epitopes
recognized by a secondary reporter (e.g., leucine zipper pair sequences, binding sites for
secondary antibodies, metal binding domains, epitope tags). In some embodiments, the labeling
group is coupled to the antigen binding protein via spacer arms of various lengths to reduce
potential steric hindrance. Various methods for labeling proteins are known in the art and may
be used in performing the present invention.
[00238]          In general, labels fall into a variety of classes, depending on the assay in which
they are to be detected: a) isotopic labels, which may be radioactive or heavy isotopes; b)
magnetic labels (e.g., magnetic particles); c) redox active moieties; d) optical dyes; enzymatic
groups (e.g. horseradish peroxidase,       -galactosidase, luciferase, alkaline phosphatase); e)
biotinylated groups; and f) predetermined polypeptide epitopes recognized by a secondary
reporter (e.g., leucine zipper pair sequences, binding sites for secondary antibodies, metal
binding domains, epitope tags, etc.). In some embodiments, the labeling group is coupled to the
antigen binding protein via spacer arms of various lengths to reduce potential steric hindrance.
Various methods for labeling proteins are known in the art and may be used in performing the
present invention.
[00239]          Specific labels include optical dyes, including, but not limited to, chromophores,
phosphors and fluorophores, with the latter being specific in many instances. Fluorophores can
be either "small molecule" fluores, or proteinaceous fluores.
[00240]          By "fluorescent label" is meant any molecule that may be detected via its inherent
fluorescent properties. Suitable fluorescent labels include, but are not limited to, fluorescein,

[00242]          The exemplary antigen binding proteins described herein have properties based on
the distinct epitope on ST2 bound by the antigen binding protein. The term "epitope" means the
amino acids of a target molecule that are contacted by an antigen binding protein, e.g., an
antibody, when the antigen binding protein is bound to the target molecule. An epitope can be
contiguous or non-contiguous (e.g., (i) in a single-chain polypeptide, amino acid residues that are
not contiguous to one another in the polypeptide sequence but that within the context of the target
molecule are bound by the antigen binding protein, or (ii) in a multimeric receptor comprising
two or more individual components, e.g., ST2 and AcP, amino acid residues are present on one
or more of the individual components but are still bound by the antigen binding protein. Epitope
determinants can include chemically active surface groupings of molecules such as amino acids,
sugar side chains, phosphoryl or sulfonyl groups, and can have specific three dimensional
structural characteristics, and/or specific charge characteristics. Generally, antigen binding
proteins specific for a particular target molecule will preferentially recognize an epitope on the
target molecule in a complex mixture of proteins and/or macromolecules.

[002511         Antigen binding proteins that have an identical epitope or overlapping epitope will
often cross-compete for binding to the antigen. Thus, in certain embodiments, an antigen binding
protein of the invention cross-competes with AbI, Ab2, Ab3, Ab4, Ab5, Ab6, Ab7, Ab8, Ab9,
Ab1O, Ab11, Ab3O, Ab32, or Ab33. To "cross-compete" or "cross-competition" means the
antigen binding proteins compete for the same epitope or binding site on a target. Such
                                                - 61-

   WO 2013/173761                                                           PCT/US2013/041656
competition can be determined by an assay in which the reference antigen binding protein (e.g.,
antibody or antigen-binding portion thereof) prevents or inhibits specific binding of a test antigen
binding protein, and vice versa. Numerous types of competitive binding assays can be used to
determine if a test molecule competes with a reference molecule for binding. Examples of assays
that can be employed include solid phase direct or indirect radioimmunoassay (RIA), solid phase
direct or indirect enzyme immunoassay (EIA), sandwich competition assay (see, e.g., Stahli et al.
(1983) Methods in Enzymology 9:242-253), solid phase direct biotin-avidin EIA (see, e.g.,
Kirkland et al., (1986) J. Immunol. 137:3614-3619), solid phase direct labeled assay, solid phase
direct labeled sandwich assay, Luminex (Jia et al "A novel method of Multiplexed Competitive
Antibody Binning for the characterization of monoclonal antibodies" J. ImmunologicalMethods
(2004) 288, 91-98) and surface plasmon resonance ((Song et al "Epitope Mapping of
Ibalizumab, a Humanized Anti-CD4 Monoclonal Antibody with Anti-HIV-1 Activity in Infected
Patients" J. Virol. (2010) 84, 6935-6942). An exemplary method of determining cross
competition is described in Example 5. Usually, when a competing antigen binding protein is
present in excess, it will inhibit binding of a reference antigen binding protein to a common
antigen by at least 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, or 75%. In some instances, binding is inhibited
by at least 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, or more.
[00252]         Ab2 binds human and cyo ST2 with high affinity and blocks IL-33 binding to
ST2, thus blocking IL-33 mediated ST2 signalling. Antibodies with identical to, similar, or
overlapping epitopes with Ab2 may share these unique characterists. In preferred embodiments,
an ST2 antigen binding protein cross-competes with Ab2 for binding to ST2. Exemplary ST2
antigen binding proteins that cross-compete with Ab2 include AbI, Ab3, Ab5, Ab7, Ab8, and
Ab30 (see Example 5). If attempting to find antibodies that bind an overlapping, similar, or
identical eptiope as Ab2, one may screen one or more antibodies for cross-competition with Ab2.
Moreover, when making variants to an antibody that cross-reacts with Ab2, one may screen such
antibodies to determine if the cross-competition is maintained after variation, suggesting that the
epitope of the variant is not significantly altered from the parent molecule. Thus, in certain
embodiments, the invention provides antibody variants that cross-compete with Ab2 for binding
to ST2.
[00253]         Besides cross-competing with each other, antibodies with overlapping, similar, or
identical epitopes may be affected by mutagenesis of ST2 similarly. Certain mutations may
inhibit binding of an antibody; others may enhance or activate binding. In Example 11, scanning
arginine/alanine mutagenesis was performed on a portion of the extracellular domain of ST2 and
the effect on exemplary antibodies determined. Included with the scope of the invention are ST2

binding proteins having characteristics such that they are affected in a similar way as an
exemplary antibody to mutagenesis.
[00254]          In certain embodiments, binding of an ST2 antigen binding protein is inhibited by
a single mutation in ST2, wherein the single mutation is selected from the group consisting of
L14R, 115R, S33R, E43R, V47R, A62R, G65R, T79R, D92R, D97R, V104R, G138R, N152R,
and V176R. In preferred embodiments, any of two or more, three or more, four or more, five or
more, six or more, seven or more, eight or more nine or more, ten or more, or all of the single
mutations of the group individually inhibit binding of the ST2 binding protein. In other
embodiments, binding of an ST2 antigen binding protein is activated by a single mutation in ST2,
wherein the single mutation is selected from the group consisting of L53R, R72A, and S73R. In
preferred embodiments, all of the single mutations of the group individually activate binding of
the ST2 binding protein. In preferred embodiments, the ST2 antigen binding protein shares the
attributes of Ab2 and are inhibited by any of L14R, 115R, S33R, E43R, V47R, A62R, G65R,
T79R, D92R, D97R, V104R, G138R, N152R, and V176R and are activated by any of L53R,
R72A, S73R.
[002551          Another method of characterizing an antibody based on its epitope is amide
hydrogen/deuterium exchange (HDX). HDX has been widely used to study protein conformation
and dynamics, protein-ligand interactions and protein-protein interactions (Z           and
 1993,Engen and SmitI 200 [). Mass spectrometric detection provides a powerful tool to
determine the extent of the exchange, because the replacement of a single hydrogen with
deuterium results in a mass increase of 1 Da for each exchange. The extent of HDX can be
readily measured at the peptide level by analysis of the protein proteolytic digest by liquid
chromatography in conjunction with tandem mass spectrometry under controlled conditions
  (Engen an-'dSe,                                                 Cdeau Lane et al 2002,

[00256]          Comparison of antigen HDX profiles between proteotlyic digests of ST2 with the
absence and the presence of an antibody (free versus bound state) can reveal the interaction sites.
Specifically, when the antibody binds to ST2, solvent accessible amide hydrogens in free ST2
can become protected, and as a result, slower exchange rates are observed. Therefore, regions
that gained less deuterium in the presence of the antibody than in its absence are potential
binding epitopes. Other factors, including exchange rate in the free-state, knowledge of the
antigen protein structure, as well as results from other epitope mapping efforts, are considered
when the epitopes are determined.

[002571          Ab2 binding to ST2 was analyzed by HDX as described in Example 12. The
analysis demonstrated that Ab2 binds to/alters the exchange rate of the portion of the ST2
structure comprising amino acids 33-44 and 88-94 of amino acids 19-322 of SEQ ID NO:1
(amino acids 15-26 and 70-76 of mature ST2, respectively). Antibodies with overlapping
epitopes, similar, or identical epitopes as Ab2 will also bind to/alter the exhange rate of amino
acids within 33-44 and 88-94 of SEQ ID NO: 1. In certain embodiments, an ST2 binding protein,
e.g., antibody, protects any of the amino acids 33-44 of SEQ ID NO: 1 when bound to ST2 and
analyzed by HDX. In other embodiments, any of amino acids 88-94 are protected. Both indicate
partial overlap of binding epitopes with Ab2. In preferred embodiments, both any of 33-44 and
any of 88-94 are protected. In certain embodiments, an ST2 binding protein, e.g., antibody,
protects all of the amino acids 3 3-44 of SEQ ID NO: 1 when bound to ST2 and analyzed by
HDX. In other embodiments, all of amino acids 88-94 are protected. Both indicate a similar
binding epitope with Ab2. In preferred embodiments, both all of 33-44 and all of 88-94 are
protected, indicating an identical or nearly identical epitope as Ab2.
[00258]          Binding of Ab2 to ST2 was further analyzed using X-ray crystallography. The X
ray crystallography was consistent with the HDX analysis. The interface between the Ab and the
antigen can be determined/defined a number of ways. In Example 13, the interface was
determined using solvent exposure differential and by distance. ST2 residues that are within the
interface with Ab2 as determined by solvent exposure differences or distance of less than 5A are
(corresponding to position in mature ST2 (lacking leader sequence)) KI, F2, P19, R20, Q21,
G22, K23, Y26, 170, V71, R72, S73, P74, T75, F76, N77, R78, T79, and Y81. In certain
embodiments, the ST2 binding protein forms an interface with ST2 that overlaps with that of
Ab2, including those wherein any of KI, F2, P19, R20, Q21, G22, K23, Y26, 170, V71, R72,
S73, P74, T75, F76, N77, R78, T79, or Y81 are within the interface. In some embodiments, the
ST2 binding protein forms an interface with ST2 wherein P19, R20, Q21, G22, K23, and/or Y26
are within the interface. In other embodiments, 170, V71, R72, S73, P74, T75, F76, N77, R78,
T79, and/or Y81 are within the interface. In preferred embodiments, KI, F2, P19, R20, Q21,
G22, K23, Y26, 170, V71, R72, S73, P74, T75, F76, N77, R78, T79, and Y81 are within the
interface.
[002591          The crystal structure indicated that certain amino acid residues formed hydrogen
bonds or salt bridges with amino acids with Ab2. Those residues include KI, R20, K23, Y26,
T75, N77, R78, and T79. In certain embodiments, an ST2 antigen binding protein forms
hydrogen bonds or a salt bridge with one or more of KI, R20, K23, Y26, T75, N77, R78, and
T79.

[00260]         The crystal structure further provides information as to which residues of Ab2
form the interface with ST2. FIG. 10 indicates the residues in the light chain variable region and
heavy chain variable region that form an interface with ST2. Also indicated are the residues that
form hydrogen bonds or salt bridges with amino acids in ST2. One may use this information to
design variants of Ab2, including those that contain variable domains having 90% identity, 95%
identity, and 10 or less insertions, deletions, and/or substitutions within the light chain or heavy
chain variable domain of Ab2. One may wish to maintain the amino acids within the interface
while altering non-interface residues. Thus, one may design and create variants of Ab2 having
one or more amino acid additions, substitutions, and/or deletions within one or more CDRs of
Ab2 that maintain binding to ST2.

[00312]         In preferred embodiments, the polypeptide encoded by the isolated nucleic acid is
a component of an antigen binding protein that binds ST2.
[00313]         Nucleotide sequences corresponding to the amino acid sequences described
herein, to be used as probes or primers for the isolation of nucleic acids or as query sequences for
database searches, can be obtained by "back-translation" from the amino acid sequences, or by
identification of regions of amino acid identity with polypeptides for which the coding DNA
sequence has been identified. The well-known polymerase chain reaction (PCR) procedure can
be employed to isolate and amplify a DNA sequence encoding a ST2 antigen binding proteins or
a desired combination of ST2 antigen binding protein polypeptide fragments. Oligonucleotides
that define the desired termini of the combination of DNA fragments are employed as 5' and 3'
primers. The oligonucleotides can additionally contain recognition sites for restriction
endonucleases, to facilitate insertion of the amplified combination of DNA fragments into an
expression vector. PCR techniques are described in Saiki et al., Science 239:487 (1988);

189-196; and PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Applications, Innis et. al., eds., Academic
Press, Inc. (1990).
[00314]         Nucleic acid molecules of the invention include DNA and RNA in both single
stranded and double-stranded form, as well as the corresponding complementary sequences.
DNA includes, for example, cDNA, genomic DNA, chemically synthesized DNA, DNA
amplified by PCR, and combinations thereof. The nucleic acid molecules of the invention
include full-length genes or cDNA molecules as well as a combination of fragments thereof. The
nucleic acids of the invention are preferentially derived from human sources, but the invention
includes those derived from non-human species, as well.
[003151         An "isolated nucleic acid" is a nucleic acid that has been separated from adjacent
genetic sequences present in the genome of the organism from which the nucleic acid was
isolated, in the case of nucleic acids isolated from naturally-occurring sources. In the case of
nucleic acids synthesized enzymatically from a template or chemically, such as PCR products,
cDNA molecules, or oligonucleotides for example, it is understood that the nucleic acids
resulting from such processes are isolated nucleic acids. An isolated nucleic acid molecule refers
to a nucleic acid molecule in the form of a separate fragment or as a component of a larger
nucleic acid construct. In one preferred embodiment, the nucleic acids are substantially free from
                                                  -71 -

    WO 2013/173761                                                         PCT/US2013/041656
contaminating endogenous material. The nucleic acid molecule has preferably been derived from
DNA or RNA isolated at least once in substantially pure form and in a quantity or concentration
enabling identification, manipulation, and recovery of its component nucleotide sequences by
standard biochemical methods (such as those outlined in Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: A
LaboratoryManual, 2nd ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY (1989)).
Such sequences are preferably provided and/or constructed in the form of an open reading frame
uninterrupted by internal non-translated sequences, or introns, that are typically present in
eukaryotic genes. Sequences of non-translated DNA can be present 5' or 3' from an open reading
frame, where the same do not interfere with manipulation or expression of the coding region.
[00316]         The present invention also includes nucleic acids that hybridize under moderately
stringent conditions, and more preferably highly stringent conditions, to nucleic acids encoding
ST2 antigen binding proteins as described herein. The basic parameters affecting the choice of
hybridization conditions and guidance for devising suitable conditions are set forth by
Sambrook,, Fritsch, and Maniatis (1989, Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring
Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., chapters 9 and 11; and Current Protocols in
Molecular Biology, 1995, Ausubel et al., eds., John Wiley & Sons, Inc., sections 2.10 and 6.3
6.4), and can be readily determined by those having ordinary skill in the art based on, for
example, the length and/or base composition of the DNA. One way of achieving moderately
stringent conditions involves the use of a prewashing solution containing 5 x SSC, 0.5% SDS,
1.0 mM EDTA (pH 8.0), hybridization buffer of about 50% formamide, 6 x SSC, and a
hybridization temperature of about 55 degrees C (or other similar hybridization solutions, such as
one containing about 50% formamide, with a hybridization temperature of about 42 degrees C),
and washing conditions of about 60 degrees C, in 0.5 x SSC, 0.1% SDS. Generally, highly
stringent conditions are defined as hybridization conditions as above, but with washing at
approximately 68 degrees C, 0.2 x SSC, 0.1% SDS. SSPE (1xSSPE is 0.15M NaCl, 10 mM
NaH.sub.2 PO.sub.4, and 1.25 mM EDTA, pH 7.4) can be substituted for SSC (1xSSC is 0.15M
NaCl and 15 mM sodium citrate) in the hybridization and wash buffers; washes are performed
for 15 minutes after hybridization is complete. It should be understood that the wash temperature
and wash salt concentration can be adjusted as necessary to achieve a desired degree of
stringency by applying the basic principles that govern hybridization reactions and duplex
stability, as known to those skilled in the art and described further below (see, e.g., Sambrook et
al., 1989). When hybridizing a nucleic acid to a target nucleic acid of unknown sequence, the
hybrid length is assumed to be that of the hybridizing nucleic acid. When nucleic acids of known
sequence are hybridized, the hybrid length can be determined by aligning the sequences of the
                                                 - 7? -

    WO 2013/173761                                                             PCT/US2013/041656
nucleic acids and identifying the region or regions of optimal sequence complementarity. The
hybridization temperature for hybrids anticipated to be less than 50 base pairs in length should be
5 to 10.degrees C less than the melting temperature (Tm) of the hybrid, where Tm is determined
according to the following equations. For hybrids less than 18 base pairs in length, Tm (degrees
C)  = 2(# of A + T bases) + 4(# of #G + C bases). For hybrids above 18 base pairs in length, Tm
(degrees C)  =  81.5 + 16 .6 (logio [Na*]) + 0.41(% G + C) - (600/N), where N is the number of
bases in the hybrid, and [Na*] is the concentration of sodium ions in the hybridization buffer
([Na*] for 1xSSC    =  0. 165M). Preferably, each such hybridizing nucleic acid has a length that is
at least 15 nucleotides (or more preferably at least 18 nucleotides, or at least 20 nucleotides, or at
least 25 nucleotides, or at least 30 nucleotides, or at least 40 nucleotides, or most preferably at
least 50 nucleotides), or at least 25% (more preferably at least 50%, or at least 60%, or at least
70%, and most preferably at least 80%) of the length of the nucleic acid of the present invention
to which it hybridizes, and has at least 60% sequence identity (more preferably at least 70%, at
least 7 5%, at least 80%, at least 81%, at least 82%, at least 83%, at least 84%, at least 85%, at
least 86%, at least  8 7 %, at least 88%, at least 89%, at least 90%, at least 91%, at least 92%, at
least 93%, at least 94%, at least 95%, at least 96%, at least 97%, at least 98%, or at least 99%,
and most preferably at least 99.5%) with the nucleic acid of the present invention to which it
hybridizes, where sequence identity is determined by comparing the sequences of the hybridizing
nucleic acids when aligned so as to maximize overlap and identity while minimizing sequence
gaps as described in more detail above.
[003171          The variants according to the invention are ordinarily prepared by site specific
mutagenesis of nucleotides in the DNA encoding the antigen binding protein, using cassette or
PCR mutagenesis or other techniques well known in the art, to produce DNA encoding the
variant, and thereafter expressing the recombinant DNA in cell culture as outlined herein.
However, antigen binding protein fragments comprising variant CDRs having up to about 100
150 residues may be prepared by in vitro synthesis using established techniques. The variants
typically exhibit the same qualitative biological activity as the naturally occurring analogue, e.g.,
binding to ST2, although variants can also be selected which have modified characteristics as
will be more fully outlined below.
[00318]          As will be appreciated by those in the art, due to the degeneracy of the genetic
code, an extremely large number of nucleic acids may be made, all of which encode the CDRs
(and heavy and light chains or other components of the antigen binding protein) of the present
invention. Thus, having identified a particular amino acid sequence, those skilled in the art could
                                                   - 71 -

make any number of different nucleic acids, by simply modifying the sequence of one or more
codons in a way which does not change the amino acid sequence of the encoded protein.
[003191          The present invention also provides expression systems and constructs in the form
of plasmids, expression vectors, transcription or expression cassettes which comprise at least one
polynucleotide as above. In addition, the invention provides host cells comprising such
expression systems or constructs.
[00320]          Typically, expression vectors used in any of the host cells will contain sequences
for plasmid maintenance and for cloning and expression of exogenous nucleotide sequences.
Such sequences, collectively referred to as "flanking sequences" in certain embodiments will
typically include one or more of the following nucleotide sequences: a promoter, one or more
enhancer sequences, an origin of replication, a transcriptional termination sequence, a complete
intron sequence containing a donor and acceptor splice site, a sequence encoding a leader
sequence for polypeptide secretion, a ribosome binding site, a polyadenylation sequence, a
polylinker region for inserting the nucleic acid encoding the polypeptide to be expressed, and a
selectable marker element. Each of these sequences is discussed below.
[00321]          Optionally, the vector may contain a "tag"-encoding sequence, i.e., an
oligonucleotide molecule located at the 5' or 3' end of the ST2 antigen binding protein coding
sequence; the oligonucleotide sequence encodes polyHis (such as hexaHis), or another "tag" such
as FLAG, HA (hemaglutinin influenza virus), or myc, for which commercially available
antibodies exist. This tag is typically fused to the polypeptide upon expression of the
polypeptide, and can serve as a means for affinity purification or detection of the ST2 antigen
binding protein from the host cell. Affinity purification can be accomplished, for example, by
column chromatography using antibodies against the tag as an affinity matrix. Optionally, the
tag can subsequently be removed from the purified ST2 antigen binding protein by various means
such as using certain peptidases for cleavage.
[00322]          Flanking sequences may be homologous (i.e., from the same species and/or strain
as the host cell), heterologous (i.e., from a species other than the host cell species or strain),
hybrid (i.e., a combination of flanking sequences from more than one source), synthetic or native.
As such, the source of a flanking sequence may be any prokaryotic or eukaryotic organism, any
vertebrate or invertebrate organism, or any plant, provided that the flanking sequence is
functional in, and can be activated by, the host cell machinery.
[00323]          Flanking sequences useful in the vectors of this invention may be obtained by any
of several methods well known in the art. Typically, flanking sequences useful herein will have
been previously identified by mapping and/or by restriction endonuclease digestion and can thus
                                                 - 74 -

be isolated from the proper tissue source using the appropriate restriction endonucleases. In
some cases, the full nucleotide sequence of a flanking sequence may be known. Here, the
flanking sequence may be synthesized using the methods described herein for nucleic acid
synthesis or cloning.
[00324]          Whether all or only a portion of the flanking sequence is known, it may be
obtained using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and/or by screening a genomic library with a
suitable probe such as an oligonucleotide and/or flanking sequence fragment from the same or
another species. Where the flanking sequence is not known, a fragment of DNA containing a
flanking sequence may be isolated from a larger piece of DNA that may contain, for example, a
coding sequence or even another gene or genes. Isolation may be accomplished by restriction
endonuclease digestion to produce the proper DNA fragment followed by isolation using agarose
gel purification, Qiagen* column chromatography (Chatsworth, CA), or other methods known to
the skilled artisan. The selection of suitable enzymes to accomplish this purpose will be readily
apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art.
[003251          An origin of replication is typically a part of those prokaryotic expression vectors
purchased commercially, and the origin aids in the amplification of the vector in a host cell. If
the vector of choice does not contain an origin of replication site, one may be chemically
synthesized based on a known sequence, and ligated into the vector. For example, the origin of
replication from the plasmid pBR322 (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) is suitable for most
gram-negative bacteria, and various viral origins (e.g., SV40, polyoma, adenovirus, vesicular
stomatitus virus (VSV), or papillomaviruses such as HPV or BPV) are useful for cloning vectors
in mammalian cells. Generally, the origin of replication component is not needed for mammalian
expression vectors (for example, the SV40 origin is often used only because it also contains the
virus early promoter).
[00326]          A transcription termination sequence is typically located 3' to the end of a
polypeptide coding region and serves to terminate transcription. Usually, a transcription
termination sequence in prokaryotic cells is a G-C rich fragment followed by a poly-T sequence.
While the sequence is easily cloned from a library or even purchased commercially as part of a
vector, it can also be readily synthesized using methods for nucleic acid synthesis such as those
described herein.
[003271          A selectable marker gene encodes a protein necessary for the survival and growth
of a host cell grown in a selective culture medium. Typical selection marker genes encode
proteins that (a) confer resistance to antibiotics or other toxins, e.g., ampicillin, tetracycline, or
kanamycin for prokaryotic host cells; (b) complement auxotrophic deficiencies of the cell; or (c)

supply critical nutrients not available from complex or defined media. Specific selectable
markers are the kanamycin resistance gene, the ampicillin resistance gene, and the tetracycline
resistance gene. Advantageously, a neomycin resistance gene may also be used for selection in
both prokaryotic and eukaryotic host cells.
[00328]         Other selectable genes may be used to amplify the gene that will be expressed.
Amplification is the process wherein genes that are required for production of a protein critical
for growth or cell survival are reiterated in tandem within the chromosomes of successive
generations of recombinant cells. Examples of suitable selectable markers for mammalian cells
include dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and promoterless thyrnidine kinase genes. Mammalian
cell transformants are placed under selection pressure wherein only the transformants are
uniquely adapted to survive by virtue of the selectable gene present in the vector. Selection
pressure is imposed by culturing the transformed cells under conditions in which the
concentration of selection agent in the medium is successively increased, thereby leading to the
amplification of both the selectable gene and the DNA that encodes another gene, such as an
antigen binding protein antibody that binds to ST2 polypeptide. As a result, increased quantities
of a polypeptide such as an ST2 antigen binding protein are synthesized from the amplified
DNA.
[00329]         A ribosome-binding site is usually necessary for translation initiation of rnRNA
and is characterized by a Shine-Dalgarno sequence (prokaryotes) or a Kozak sequence
(eukaryotes). The element is typically located 3' to the promoter and 5' to the coding sequence of
the polypeptide to be expressed. In certain embodiments, one or more coding regions may be
operably linked to an internal ribosome binding site (IRES), allowing translation of two open
reading frames from a single RNA transcript.
[00330]         In some cases, such as where glycosylation is desired in a eukaryotic host cell
expression system, one may manipulate the various pre- or prosequences to improve
glycosylation or yield. For example, one may alter the peptidase cleavage site of a particular
signal peptide, or add prosequences, which also may affect glycosylation. The final protein
product may have, in the -1 position (relative to the first amino acid of the mature protein) one or
more additional amino acids incident to expression, which may not have been totally removed.
For example, the final protein product may have one or two amino acid residues found in the
peptidase cleavage site, attached to the amino-terminus. Alternatively, use of some enzyme
cleavage sites may result in a slightly truncated form of the desired polypeptide, if the enzyme
cuts at such area within the mature polypeptide.

that is recognized by the host organism and operably linked to the molecule encoding the ST2
antigen binding protein. Promoters are untranscribed sequences located upstream (i.e., 5') to the
start codon of a structural gene (generally within about 100 to 1000 bp) that control transcription
of the structural gene. Promoters are conventionally grouped into one of two classes: inducible
promoters and constitutive promoters. Inducible promoters initiate increased levels of
transcription from DNA under their control in response to some change in culture conditions,
such as the presence or absence of a nutrient or a change in temperature. Constitutive promoters,
on the other hand, uniformly transcribe gene to which they are operably linked, that is, with little
or no control over gene expression. A large number of promoters, recognized by a variety of
potential host cells, are well known. A suitable promoter is operably linked to the DNA
encoding heavy chain or light chain comprising an ST2 antigen binding protein of the invention
by removing the promoter from the source DNA by restriction enzyme digestion and inserting
the desired promoter sequence into the vector.
[00332]         Suitable promoters for use with yeast hosts are also well known in the art. Yeast
enhancers are advantageously used with yeast promoters. Suitable promoters for use with
mammalian host cells are well known and include, but are not limited to, those obtained from the
genomes of viruses such as polyoma virus, fowlpox virus, adenovirus (such as Adenovirus 2),
bovine papilloma virus, avian sarcoma virus, cytomegalovirus, retroviruses, hepatitis-B virus and
most preferably Simian Virus 40 (SV40). Other suitable mammalian promoters include
heterologous mammalian promoters, for example, heat-shock promoters and the actin promoter.
[00333]         Additional promoters which may be of interest include, but are not limited to:
SV40 early promoter (Benoist and Chambon, 1981, Nature 290:304-310); CMV promoter
(Thomsen et al., 1984, Proc.Natl. Acad. U.S.A. 81:659-663); the promoter contained in the 3'
long terminal repeat of Rous sarcoma virus (Yamamoto et al., 1980, Cell 22:787-797); herpes

296:39-42); and prokaryotic promoters such as the beta-lactamase promoter (Villa-Kamaroff et
al., 1978, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 75:3727-373 1); or the tac promoter (DeBoer et al., 1983,
Proc.Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 80:21-25). Also of interest are the following animal transcriptional
control regions, which exhibit tissue specificity and have been utilized in transgenic animals: the
elastase I gene control region that is active in pancreatic acinar cells (Swift et al., 1984, Cell

Science 253:53-58); the alpha 1-antitrypsin gene control region that is active in liver (Kelsey et
al., 1987, Genes and Devel. 1:161-171); the beta-globin gene control region that is active in
myeloid cells (Mogram et al., 1985, Nature 315:338-340; Kollias et al., 1986, Cell 46:89-94); the
myelin basic protein gene control region that is active in oligodendrocyte cells in the brain
(Readhead et al., 1987, Cell 48:703-712); the myosin light chain-2 gene control region that is
active in skeletal muscle (Sani, 1985, Nature 314:283-286); and the gonadotropic releasing
hormone gene control region that is active in the hypothalamus (Mason et al., 1986, Science
234:1372-1378).
[00334]          An enhancer sequence may be inserted into the vector to increase transcription of
DNA encoding light chain or heavy chain comprising a ST2 antigen binding protein of the
invention by higher eukaryotes. Enhancers are cis-acting elements of DNA, usually about 10
300 bp in length, that act on the promoter to increase transcription. Enhancers are relatively
orientation and position independent, having been found at positions both 5' and 3' to the
transcription unit. Several enhancer sequences available from mammalian genes are known (e.g.,
globin, elastase, albumin, alpha-feto-protein and insulin). Typically, however, an enhancer from
a virus is used. The SV40 enhancer, the cytomegalovirus early promoter enhancer, the polyoma
enhancer, and adenovirus enhancers known in the art are exemplary enhancing elements for the
activation of eukaryotic promoters. While an enhancer may be positioned in the vector either 5'
or 3' to a coding sequence, it is typically located at a site 5' from the promoter. A sequence
encoding an appropriate native or heterologous signal sequence (leader sequence or signal
peptide) can be incorporated into an expression vector, to promote extracellular secretion of the
antibody. The choice of signal peptide or leader depends on the type of host cells in which the
antibody is to be produced, and a heterologous signal sequence can replace the native signal
sequence. Examples of signal peptides that are functional in mammalian host cells include the
following: the signal sequence for interleukin-7 (IL-7) described in US Patent No. 4,965,195; the
signal sequence for interleukin-2 receptor described in Cosman et al., 1984, Nature 312:768; the
interleukin-4 receptor signal peptide described in EP Patent No. 0367 566; the type I interleukin

1 receptor signal peptide described in U.S. Patent No. 4,968,607; the type II interleukin-1
receptor signal peptide described in EP Patent No. 0 460 846.
[003351          The vector may contain one or more elements that facilitate expression when the
vector is integrated into the host cell genome. Examples include an EASE element (Aldrich et al.
2003 Biotechnol Prog. 19:1433-38) and a matrix attachment region (MAR). MARs mediate
structural organization of the chromatin and may insulate the integrated vactor from "position"
effect. Thus, MARs are particularly useful when the vector is used to create stable transfectants.
A number of natural and synthetic MAR-containing nucleic acids are known in the art, e.g., U.S.
Pat. Nos. 6,239,328; 7,326,567; 6,177,612; 6,388,066; 6,245,974; 7,259,010; 6,037,525;
7,422,874; 7,129,062.
[00336]          Expression vectors of the invention may be constructed from a starting vector
such as a commercially available vector. Such vectors may or may not contain all of the desired
flanking sequences. Where one or more of the flanking sequences described herein are not
already present in the vector, they may be individually obtained and ligated into the vector.
Methods used for obtaining each of the flanking sequences are well known to one skilled in the
art.
[003371          After the vector has been constructed and a nucleic acid molecule encoding light
chain, a heavy chain, or a light chain and a heavy chain comprising an ST2 antigen binding
sequence has been inserted into the proper site of the vector, the completed vector may be
inserted into a suitable host cell for amplification and/or polypeptide expression. The
transformation of an expression vector for an ST2 antigen binding protein into a selected host
cell may be accomplished by well known methods including transfection, infection, calcium
phosphate co-precipitation, electroporation, microinjection, lipofection, DEAE-dextran mediated
transfection, or other known techniques. The method selected will in part be a function of the
type of host cell to be used. These methods and other suitable methods are well known to the
skilled artisan, and are set forth, for example, in Sambrook et al., 2001, supra.
[00338]          A host cell, when cultured under appropriate conditions, synthesizes an ST2
antigen binding protein that can subsequently be collected from the culture medium (if the host
cell secretes it into the medium) or directly from the host cell producing it (if it is not secreted).
The selection of an appropriate host cell will depend upon various factors, such as desired
expression levels, polypeptide modifications that are desirable or necessary for activity (such as
glycosylation or phosphorylation) and ease of folding into a biologically active molecule. A host
cell may be eukaryotic or prokaryotic.

[003391         Mammalian cell lines available as hosts for expression are well known in the art
and include, but are not limited to, immortalized cell lines available from the American Type
Culture Collection (ATCC) and any cell lines used in an expression system known in the art can
be used to make the recombinant polypeptides of the invention. In general, host cells are
transformed with a recombinant expression vector that comprises DNA encoding a desired anti
ST2 antibody polypeptide. Among the host cells that may be employed are prokaryotes, yeast or
higher eukaryotic cells. Prokaryotes include gram negative or gram positive organisms, for
example E. coli or bacilli. Higher eukaryotic cells include insect cells and established cell lines
of mammalian origin. Examples of suitable mammalian host cell lines include the COS-7 line of
monkey kidney cells (ATCC CRL 1651) (Gluzman et al., 1981, Cell 23:175), L cells, 293 cells,
C127 cells, 3T3 cells (ATCC CCL 163), Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, or their derivatives
such as Veggie CHO and related cell lines which grow in serum-free media (Rasmussen et al.,
1998, Cytotechnology 28: 31), HeLa cells, BHK (ATCC CRL 10) cell lines, and the CVI/EBNA
cell line derived from the African green monkey kidney cell line CVI (ATCC CCL 70) as
described by McMahan et al., 1991, EMBO J. 10: 2821, human embryonic kidney cells such as
293, 293 EBNA or MSR 293, human epidermal A431 cells, human Colo205 cells, other
transformed primate cell lines, normal diploid cells, cell strains derived from in vitro culture of
primary tissue, primary explants, HL-60, U937, HaK or Jurkat cells. Optionally, mammalian cell
lines such as HepG2/3B, KB, NIH 3T3 or S49, for example, can be used for expression of the
polypeptide when it is desirable to use the polypeptide in various signal transduction or reporter
assays. Alternatively, it is possible to produce the polypeptide in lower eukaryotes such as yeast
or in prokaryotes such as bacteria. Suitable yeasts include Saccharomyces cerevisiae,
Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Kluyveromyces strains, Candida, or any yeast strain capable of
expressing heterologous polypeptides. Suitable bacterial strains include Escherichia coli,
Bacillus subtilis, Salmonella typhimurium, or any bacterial strain capable of expressing
heterologous polypeptides. If the polypeptide is made in yeast or bacteria, it may be desirable to
modify the polypeptide produced therein, for example by phosphorylation or glycosylation of the
appropriate sites, in order to obtain the functional polypeptide. Such covalent attachments can be
accomplished using known chemical or enzymatic methods. The polypeptide can also be
produced by operably linking the isolated nucleic acid of the invention to suitable control
sequences in one or more insect expression vectors, and employing an insect expression system.
Materials and methods for baculovirus/insect cell expression systems are commercially available
in kit form from, e.g., Invitrogen, San Diego, Calif., U.S.A. (the MaxBac@ kit), and such
methods are well known in the art, as described in Summers and Smith, Texas Agricultural

    WO 2013/173761                                                          PCT/US2013/041656
Experiment Station Bulletin No. 1555 (1987), and Luckow and Summers, Bio/Technology 6:47
(1988). Cell-free translation systems could also be employed to produce polypeptides using
RNAs derived from nucleic acid constructs disclosed herein. Appropriate cloning and expression
vectors for use with bacterial, fungal, yeast, and mammalian cellular hosts are described by
Pouwels et al. (Cloning Vectors: A LaboratoryManual, Elsevier, New York, 1985). A host cell
that comprises an isolated nucleic acid of the invention, preferably operably linked to at least one
expression control sequence, is a "recombinant host cell".
[00340]         In certain embodiments, cell lines may be selected through determining which cell
lines have high expression levels and constitutively produce antigen binding proteins with ST2
binding properties. In another embodiment, a cell line from the B cell lineage that does not make
its own antibody but has a capacity to make and secrete a heterologous antibody can be selected.
        Cell-depleting ST2 Antigen Binding Proteins
[00341]         In preferred embodiments, the ST2 antigen binding protein binds ST2 and inhibits
IL-33 binding, thereby reducing IL-33 mediated signaling in ST2-expressing cells. In certain
embodiments, however, the ST2 antigen binding protein binds ST2 and targets an ST2
expressing cell for depletion. Of course, the ST2 antigen binding protein may inhibit IL-33
binding and target the ST2 cell for depletion.
[00342]         Cell-depleting ST2 antigen binding proteins are particularly useful for treating
diseases associated with over expression of ST2, e.g., an inflammatory disease or an ST2
expressing tumor. Methods of targeting cells with antigen binding proteins, e.g. antibodies, are
well known in the art. Exemplary embodiments are discussed below.
        Antibody Drug Conjugates
[00343]         Embodiments of the invention include antibody drug conjugates (ADCs).
Generally the ADC comprises an antibody conjugated to a chemotherapeutic agent, e.g., a
cytotoxic agent, a cytostatic agent, a toxin, or a radioactive agent. A linker molecule can be used
to conjugate the drug to the antibody. A wide variety of linkers and drugs useful in ADC
technology are known in the art and may be used in embodiments of the present invention. (See

linker components. Exemplary linker components include 6-maleimidocaproyl,
maleimidopropanoyl, valine-citrulline, alanine-phenylalanine, p-aminobenzyloxycarbonyl, and

succinimidyl (4-iodo-acetyl) aminobenzoate ("SIAB").
[003451         Linkers may be a "cleavable" linker or a "non-cleavable" linker (Ducry and
Stump, Bioconjugate Chem. 2010, 21, 5-13; incorporated herein by reference in its entirety)
Cleavable linkers are designed to release the drug when subjected to certain environment factors,
e.g., when internalized into the target cell. Cleavable linkers include acid labile linkers, protease
sensitive linkers, photolabile linkers, dimethyl linker or disulfide-containing linkers. Non
cleavable linkers tend to remain covalently associated with at least one amino acid of the
antibody and the drug upon internalization by and degradation within the target cell. An
exemplary non-cleavable linker is MCC.

position modified with a hydroxyl a group, and the C-20 position having a hydroxyl group are all
suitable (US Pat. Nos. 5208020, RE39151, and 6913748; US Patent Appl. Pub. Nos.

        Effector Function-Enhanced Antibodies
[00352]         One of the functions of the Fc portion of an antibody is to communicate to the
immune system when the antibody binds its target. This is considered "effector function."
Communication leads to antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), antibody-dependent
cellular phagocytosis (ADCP), and/or complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC). ADCC and
ADCP are mediated through the binding of the Fc to Fc receptors on the surface of cells of the
immune system. CDC is mediated through the binding of the Fc with proteins of the
complement system, e.g., Clq.
[00353]         The IgG subclasses vary in their ability to mediate effector functions. For
example, IgGI is much superior to IgG2 and IgG4 at mediating ADCC and CDC. Thus, in
embodiments wherein a cell expressing ST2 is targeted for destruction, an anti-ST2 IgG1
antibody would be preferred.
[00354]         The effector function of an antibody can be increased, or decreased, by
introducing one or more mutations into the Fc. Embodiments of the invention include antigen
binding proteins, e.g., antibodies, having an Fc engineered to increase effector function (U.S.
7,317,091 and Strohl, Curr. Opin. Biotech., 20:685-691, 2009; both incorporated herein by
reference in its entirety). . Exemplary IgGI Fc molecules having increased effector function
include (based on the Kabat numbering scheme) those have the following substitutions:

[003731          Further embodiments of the invention include antigen binding proteins, e.g.,
antibodies, having an Fe engineered to decrease effector function. Exemplary Fc molecules
having decreased effector function include (based on the Kabat numbering scheme) those have
the following substitutions:

[00382]           S267E/L328F (IgGI)
[00383]          Another method of increasing effector function of IgG Fc-containing proteins is
by reducing the fucosylation of the Fc. Removal of the core fucose from the biantennary
complex-type oligosachharides attached to the Fc greatly increased ADCC effector function
without altering antigen binding or CDC effector function. Several ways are known for reducing
or abolishing fucosylation of Fc-containing molecules, e.g., antibodies. These include
recombinant expression in certain mammalian cell lines including a FUT8 knockout cell line,
variant CHO line Lec 13, rat hybridoma cell line YB2/0, a cell line comprising a small interfering
RNA specifically against the FUT8 gene, and a cell line coexpressing P-1,4-N
acetylglucosaminyltransferase III and Golgi a-mannosidase II. Alternatively, the Fc-containing
molecule may be expressed in a non-mammalian cell such as a plant cell, yeast, or prokaryotic
cell, e.g., E. coli. Thus, in certain embodiments of the invention, a composition comprises an
antibody, e.g., Abl, Ab2, Ab3, Ab4, Ab5, Ab6, Ab7, Ab8, Ab9, Ab10, or Ab 11 having reduced
fucosylation or lacking fucosylation altogether.
         Pharmaceutical Compositions
[00384]          In some embodiments, the invention provides a pharmaceutical composition
comprising a therapeutically effective amount of one or a plurality of the antigen binding proteins

of the invention together with a pharmaceutically effective diluents, carrier, solubilizer,
emulsifier, preservative, and/or adjuvant. In certain embodiments, the antigen binding protein is
an antibody. Pharmaceutical compositions of the invention include, but are not limited to, liquid,
frozen, and lyophilized compositions.
[003851          Preferably, formulation materials are nontoxic to recipients at the dosages and
concentrations employed. In specific embodiments, pharmaceutical compositions comprising a
therapeutically effective amount of a ST2 antigen binding protein, e.g, a ST2-binding antibody,
are provided.
[00386]          In certain embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition may contain formulation
materials for modifying, maintaining or preserving, for example, the pH, osmolarity, viscosity,
clarity, color, isotonicity, odor, sterility, stability, rate of dissolution or release, adsorption or
penetration of the composition. In such embodiments, suitable formulation materials include, but
are not limited to, amino acids (such as glycine, glutamine, asparagine, arginine, proline, or
lysine); antimicrobials; antioxidants (such as ascorbic acid, sodium sulfite or sodium hydrogen
sulfite); buffers (such as borate, bicarbonate, Tris-HCl, citrates, phosphates or other organic
acids); bulking agents (such as mannitol or glycine); chelating agents (such as ethylenediamine
tetraacetic acid (EDTA)); complexing agents (such as caffeine, polyvinylpyrrolidone, beta
cyclodextrin or hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin); fillers; monosaccharides; disaccharides; and
other carbohydrates (such as glucose, mannose or dextrins); proteins (such as serum albumin,
gelatin or immunoglobulins); coloring, flavoring and diluting agents; emulsifying agents;
hydrophilic polymers (such as polyvinylpyrrolidone); low molecular weight polypeptides; salt
forming counterions (such as sodium); preservatives (such as benzalkonium chloride, benzoic
acid, salicylic acid, thimerosal, phenethyl alcohol, methylparaben, propylparaben, chlorhexidine,
sorbic acid or hydrogen peroxide); solvents (such as glycerin, propylene glycol or polyethylene
glycol); sugar alcohols (such as mannitol or sorbitol); suspending agents; surfactants or wetting
agents (such as pluronics, PEG, sorbitan esters, polysorbates such as polysorbate 20, polysorbate,
triton, tromethamine, lecithin, cholesterol, tyloxapal); stability enhancing agents (such as sucrose
or sorbitol); tonicity enhancing agents (such as alkali metal halides, preferably sodium or
potassium chloride, mannitol sorbitol); delivery vehicles; diluents; excipients and/or
pharmaceutical adjuvants. See, REMINGTON'S PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES, 18"
Edition, (A. R. Genrmo, ed.), 1990, Mack Publishing Company.
[003871          In certain embodiments, the optimal pharmaceutical composition will be
determined by one skilled in the art depending upon, for example, the intended route of
administration, delivery format and desired dosage. See, for example, REMINGTON'S

PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES, supra. In certain embodiments, such compositions may
influence the physical state, stability, rate of in vivo release and rate of in vivo clearance of the
antigen binding proteins of the invention. In certain embodiments, the primary vehicle or carrier
in a pharmaceutical composition may be either aqueous or non-aqueous in nature. For example,
a suitable vehicle or carrier may be water for injection, physiological saline solution or artificial
cerebrospinal fluid, possibly supplemented with other materials common in compositions for
parenteral administration. Neutral buffered saline or saline mixed with serum albumin are further
exemplary vehicles. In specific embodiments, pharmaceutical compositions comprise Tris buffer
of about pH 7.0-8.5, or acetate buffer of about pH 4.0-5.5, and may further include sorbitol or a
suitable substitute therefor. In certain embodiments of the invention, ST2 antigen binding
protein compositions may be prepared for storage by mixing the selected composition having the
desired degree of purity with optional formulation agents (REMINGTON'S
PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES, supra) in the form of a lyophilized cake or an aqueous
solution. Further, in certain embodiments, the ST2 antigen binding protein product may be
formulated as a lyophilizate using appropriate excipients such as sucrose.
[00388]         The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention can be selected for parenteral
delivery. Alternatively, the compositions may be selected for inhalation or for delivery through
the digestive tract, such as orally. Preparation of such pharmaceutically acceptable compositions
is within the skill of the art. The formulation components are present preferably in
concentrations that are acceptable to the site of administration. In certain embodiments, buffers
are used to maintain the composition at physiological pH or at a slightly lower pH, typically
within a pH range of from about 5 to about 8.
[00389]         When parenteral administration is contemplated, the therapeutic compositions for
use in this invention may be provided in the form of a pyrogen-free, parenterally acceptable
aqueous solution comprising the desired ST2 antigen binding protein in a pharmaceutically
acceptable vehicle. A particularly suitable vehicle for parenteral injection is sterile distilled
water in which the ST2 antigen binding protein is formulated as a sterile, isotonic solution,
properly preserved. In certain embodiments, the preparation can involve the formulation of the
desired molecule with an agent, such as injectable microspheres, bio-erodible particles,
polymeric compounds (such as polylactic acid or polyglycolic acid), beads or liposomes, that
may provide controlled or sustained release of the product which can be delivered via depot
injection. In certain embodiments, hyaluronic acid may also be used, having the effect of
promoting sustained duration in the circulation. In certain embodiments, implantable drug
delivery devices may be used to introduce the desired antigen binding protein.

    WO 2013/173761                                                          PCT/US2013/041656
[003901          Pharmaceutical compositions of the invention can be formulated for inhalation. In
these embodiments, ST2 antigen binding proteins are advantageously formulated as a dry,
inhalable powder. In specific embodiments, ST2 antigen binding protein inhalation solutions
may also be formulated with a propellant for aerosol delivery. In certain embodiments, solutions
may be nebulized. Pulmonary administration and formulation methods therefore are further
described in International Patent Application No. PCT/US94/001875, which is incorporated by
reference and describes pulmonary delivery of chemically modified proteins.
[00391]          It is also contemplated that formulations can be administered orally. ST2 antigen
binding proteins that are administered in this fashion can be formulated with or without carriers
customarily used in the compounding of solid dosage forms such as tablets and capsules. In
certain embodiments, a capsule may be designed to release the active portion of the formulation
at the point in the gastrointestinal tract when bioavailability is maximized and pre-systemic
degradation is minimized. Additional agents can be included to facilitate absorption of the ST2
antigen binding protein. Diluents, flavorings, low melting point waxes, vegetable oils, lubricants,
suspending agents, tablet disintegrating agents, and binders may also be employed.
[00392]          Additional pharmaceutical compositions will be evident to those skilled in the art,
including formulations involving ST2 antigen binding proteins in sustained- or controlled
delivery formulations. Techniques for formulating a variety of other sustained- or controlled
delivery means, such as liposome carriers, bio-erodible microparticles or porous beads and depot
injections, are also known to those skilled in the art. See, for example, International Patent
Application No. PCT/US93/00829, which is incorporated by reference and describes controlled
release of porous polymeric microparticles for delivery of pharmaceutical compositions.
Sustained-release preparations may include semipermeable polymer matrices in the form of
shaped articles, e.g., films, or microcapsules. Sustained release matrices may include polyesters,
hydrogels, polylactides (as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,773,919 and European Patent Application
Publication No. EP 058481, each of which is incorporated by reference), copolymers of L
glutamic acid and gamma ethyl-L-glutamate (Sidman et al., 1983, Biopolymers 2:547-556), poly
(2-hydroxyethyl-methacrylate) (Langer et al., 1981, J. Biomed. Mater. Res. 15:167-277 and
Langer, 1982, Chem. Tech. 12:98-105), ethylene vinyl acetate (Langer et al., 1981, supra) or
poly-D(-)-3-hydroxybutyric acid (European Patent Application Publication No. EP 133,988).
Sustained release compositions may also include liposomes that can be prepared by any of
several methods known in the art. See, e.g., Eppstein et al., 1985, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.
82:3688-3692; European Patent Application Publication Nos. EP 036,676; EP 088,046 and EP

[003931          Pharmaceutical compositions used for in vivo administration are typically
provided as sterile preparations. Sterilization can be accomplished by filtration through sterile
filtration membranes. When the composition is lyophilized, sterilization using this method may
be conducted either prior to or following lyophilization and reconstitution. Compositions for
parenteral administration can be stored in lyophilized form or in a solution. Parenteral
compositions generally are placed into a container having a sterile access port, for example, an
intravenous solution bag or vial having a stopper pierceable by a hypodermic injection needle.
[00394]          Aspects of the invention includes self-buffering ST2 antigen binding protein
formulations, which can be used as pharmaceutical compositions, as described in international
patent application WO 06138181A2 (PCT/US2006/022599), which is incorporated by reference
in its entirety herein.
[003951          As discussed above, certain embodiments provide ST2 antigen binding proteins
protein compositions, particularly pharmaceutical ST2 antigen binding protein compositions, that
comprise, in addition to the ST2 antigen binding protein, one or more excipients such as those
illustratively described in this section and elsewhere herein. Excipients can be used in the
invention in this regard for a wide variety of purposes, such as adjusting physical, chemical, or
biological properties of formulations, such as adjustment of viscosity, and or processes of the
invention to improve effectiveness and or to stabilize such formulations and processes against
degradation and spoilage due to, for instance, stresses that occur during manufacturing, shipping,
storage, pre-use preparation, administration, and thereafter.
[00396]          A variety of expositions are available on protein stabilization and formulation
materials and methods useful in this regard, such as Arakawa et al., "Solvent interactions in
pharmaceutical formulations," Pharm Res. 8(3): 285-91 (1991); Kendrick et al., "Physical
stabilization of proteins in aqueous solution," in: RATIONAL DESIGN OF STABLE PROTEIN
FORMULATIONS: THEORY AND PRACTICE, Carpenter and Manning, eds. Pharmaceutical
Biotechnology. 13: 61-84 (2002), and Randolph et al., "Surfactant-protein interactions," Pharm
Biotechnol. 13: 159-75 (2002), each of which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety,
particularly in parts pertinent to excipients and processes of the same for self-buffering protein
formulations in accordance with the current invention, especially as to protein pharmaceutical
products and processes for veterinary and/or human medical uses.
[003971          Salts may be used in accordance with certain embodiments of the invention to, for
example, adjust the ionic strength and/or the isotonicity of a formulation and/or to improve the
solubility and/or physical stability of a protein or other ingredient of a composition in accordance
with the invention.

[003981         As is well known, ions can stabilize the native state of proteins by binding to
charged residues on the protein's surface and by shielding charged and polar groups in the protein
and reducing the strength of their electrostatic interactions, attractive, and repulsive interactions.
Ions also can stabilize the denatured state of a protein by binding to, in particular, the denatured
peptide linkages (--CONH) of the protein. Furthermore, ionic interaction with charged and polar
groups in a protein also can reduce intermolecular electrostatic interactions and, thereby, prevent
or reduce protein aggregation and insolubility.
[00399]         Ionic species differ significantly in their effects on proteins. A number of
categorical rankings of ions and their effects on proteins have been developed that can be used in
formulating pharmaceutical compositions in accordance with the invention. One example is the
Hofmeister series, which ranks ionic and polar non-ionic solutes by their effect on the
conformational stability of proteins in solution. Stabilizing solutes are referred to as
"kosmotropic." Destabilizing solutes are referred to as "chaotropic." Kosmotropes commonly
are used at high concentrations (e.g., >1 molar ammonium sulfate) to precipitate proteins from
solution ("salting-out"). Chaotropes commonly are used to denture and/or to solubilize proteins
("salting-in"). The relative effectiveness of ions to "salt-in" and "salt-out" defines their position
in the Hofmeister series.
[00400]         Free amino acids can be used in ST2 antigen binding protein formulations in
accordance with various embodiments of the invention as bulking agents, stabilizers, and
antioxidants, as well as other standard uses. Lysine, proline, seine, and alanine can be used for
stabilizing proteins in a formulation. Glycine is useful in lyophilization to ensure correct cake
structure and properties. Arginine may be useful to inhibit protein aggregation, in both liquid
and lyophilized formulations. Methionine is useful as an antioxidant.
[00401]         Polyols include sugars, e.g., mannitol, sucrose, and sorbitol and polyhydric
alcohols such as, for instance, glycerol and propylene glycol, and, for purposes of discussion
herein, polyethylene glycol (PEG) and related substances. Polyols are kosmotropic. They are
useful stabilizing agents in both liquid and lyophilized formulations to protect proteins from
physical and chemical degradation processes. Polyols also are useful for adjusting the tonicity of
formulations.
[00402]         Among polyols useful in select embodiments of the invention is mannitol,
commonly used to ensure structural stability of the cake in lyophilized formulations. It ensures
structural stability to the cake. It is generally used with a lyoprotectant, e.g., sucrose. Sorbitol
and sucrose are among preferred agents for adjusting tonicity and as stabilizers to protect against
freeze-thaw stresses during transport or the preparation of bulks during the manufacturing
                                                  -91  -

    WO 2013/173761                                                          PCT/US2013/041656
process. Reducing sugars (which contain free aldehyde or ketone groups), such as glucose and
lactose, can glycate surface lysine and arginine residues. Therefore, they generally are not
among preferred polyols for use in accordance with the invention. In addition, sugars that form
such reactive species, such as sucrose, which is hydrolyzed to fructose and glucose under acidic
conditions, and consequently engenders glycation, also is not among preferred polyols of the
invention in this regard. PEG is useful to stabilize proteins and as a cryoprotectant and can be
used in the invention in this regard.
[00403]          Embodiments of the ST2 antigen binding protein formulations further comprise
surfactants. Protein molecules may be susceptible to adsorption on surfaces and to denaturation
and consequent aggregation at air-liquid, solid-liquid, and liquid-liquid interfaces. These effects
generally scale inversely with protein concentration. These deleterious interactions generally
scale inversely with protein concentration and typically are exacerbated by physical agitation,
such as that generated during the shipping and handling of a product.
[00404]          Surfactants routinely are used to prevent, minimize, or reduce surface adsorption.
Useful surfactants in the invention in this regard include polysorbate 20, polysorbate 80, other
fatty acid esters of sorbitan polyethoxylates, and poloxamer 188.
[004051          Surfactants also are commonly used to control protein conformational stability.
The use of surfactants in this regard is protein-specific since, any given surfactant typically will
stabilize some proteins and destabilize others.
[00406]          Polysorbates are susceptible to oxidative degradation and often, as supplied,
contain sufficient quantities of peroxides to cause oxidation of protein residue side-chains,
especially methionine. Consequently, polysorbates should be used carefully, and when used,
should be employed at their lowest effective concentration. In this regard, polysorbates exemplify
the general rule that excipients should be used in their lowest effective concentrations.
[004071          Embodiments of ST2 antigen binding protein formulations further comprise one
or more antioxidants. To some extent deleterious oxidation of proteins can be prevented in
pharmaceutical formulations by maintaining proper levels of ambient oxygen and temperature
and by avoiding exposure to light. Antioxidant excipients can be used as well to prevent
oxidative degradation of proteins. Among useful antioxidants in this regard are reducing agents,
oxygen/free-radical scavengers, and chelating agents. Antioxidants for use in therapeutic protein
formulations in accordance with the invention preferably are water-soluble and maintain their
activity throughout the shelf life of a product. EDTA is a preferred antioxidant in accordance
with the invention in this regard.

[004081         Antioxidants can damage proteins. For instance, reducing agents, such as
glutathione in particular, can disrupt intramolecular disulfide linkages. Thus, antioxidants for use
in the invention are selected to, among other things, eliminate or sufficiently reduce the
possibility of themselves damaging proteins in the formulation.
[00409]         Formulations in accordance with the invention may include metal ions that are
protein co-factors and that are necessary to form protein coordination complexes, such as zinc
necessary to form certain insulin suspensions. Metal ions also can inhibit some processes that
degrade proteins. However, metal ions also catalyze physical and chemical processes that
degrade proteins.
[00410]         Magnesium ions (10-120 mM) can be used to inhibit isomerization of aspartic
acid to isoaspartic acid. Ca- 2 ions (up to 100 mM) can increase the stability of human
                                                                                                  2
deoxyribonuclease. Mgm , Mn       2, and Zn 2 , however, can destabilize rhDNase. Similarly, Ca
and Sr    can stabilize Factor VIII, it can be destabilized by Mg+2 , Mn  2
                                                                            and Zn+2, Cum2 and Fe 2 ,

and its aggregation can be increased by Al       ions.
[00411]         Embodiments of the ST2 antigen binding protein formulations further comprise
one or more preservatives. Preservatives are necessary when developing multi-dose parenteral
formulations that involve more than one extraction from the same container. Their primary
function is to inhibit microbial growth and ensure product sterility throughout the shelf-life or
term of use of the drug product. Commonly used preservatives include benzyl alcohol, phenol
and m-cresol. Although preservatives have a long history of use with small-molecule
parenterals, the development of protein formulations that includes preservatives can be
challenging. Preservatives almost always have a destabilizing effect (aggregation) on proteins,
and this has become a major factor in limiting their use in multi-dose protein formulations. To
date, most protein drugs have been formulated for single-use only. However, when multi-dose
formulations are possible, they have the added advantage of enabling patient convenience, and
increased marketability. A good example is that of human growth hormone (hGH) where the
development of preserved formulations has led to commercialization of more convenient, multi
use injection pen presentations. At least four such pen devices containing preserved formulations
of hGH are currently available on the market. Norditropin (liquid, Novo Nordisk), Nutropin AQ
(liquid, Genentech) & Genotropin (lyophilized--dual chamber cartridge, Pharmacia & Upjohn)
contain phenol while Somatrope (Eli Lilly) is formulated with m-cresol.
[00412]          Several aspects need to be considered during the formulation and development of
preserved dosage forms. The effective preservative concentration in the drug product must be
                                                   - 93 -

optimized. This requires testing a given preservative in the dosage form with concentration
ranges that confer anti-microbial effectiveness without compromising protein stability.
[00413]          As might be expected, development of liquid formulations containing
preservatives are more challenging than lyophilized formulations. Freeze-dried products can be
lyophilized without the preservative and reconstituted with a preservative containing diluent at
the time of use. This shortens the time for which a preservative is in contact with the protein,
significantly minimizing the associated stability risks. With liquid formulations, preservative
effectiveness and stability should be maintained over the entire product shelf-life (.about. 18 to 24
months). An important point to note is that preservative effectiveness should be demonstrated in
the final formulation containing the active drug and all excipient components.
[00414]          ST2 antigen binding protein formulations generally will be designed for specific
routes and methods of administration, for specific administration dosages and frequencies of
administration, for specific treatments of specific diseases, with ranges of bio-availability and
persistence, among other things. Formulations thus may be designed in accordance with the
invention for delivery by any suitable route, including but not limited to orally, aurally,
opthalmically, rectally, and vaginally, and by parenteral routes, including intravenous and
intraarterial injection, intramuscular injection, and subcutaneous injection.
[004151          Once the pharmaceutical composition has been formulated, it may be stored in
sterile vials as a solution, suspension, gel, emulsion, solid, crystal, or as a dehydrated or
lyophilized powder. Such formulations may be stored either in a ready-to-use form or in a form
(e.g., lyophilized) that is reconstituted prior to administration. The invention also provides kits
for producing a single-dose administration unit. The kits of the invention may each contain both
a first container having a dried protein and a second container having an aqueous formulation. In
certain embodiments of this invention, kits containing single and multi-chambered pre-filled
syringes (e.g., liquid syringes and lyosyringes) are provided.
[00416]          The therapeutically effective amount of an ST2 antigen binding protein-containing
pharmaceutical composition to be employed will depend, for example, upon the therapeutic
context and objectives. One skilled in the art will appreciate that the appropriate dosage levels
for treatment will vary depending, in part, upon the molecule delivered, the indication for which
the ST2 antigen binding protein is being used, the route of administration, and the size (body
weight, body surface or organ size) and/or condition (the age and general health) of the patient.
In certain embodiments, the clinician may titer the dosage and modify the route of administration
to obtain the optimal therapeutic effect. A typical dosage may range from about 0.1 .g/kg to up
to about 30 mg/kg or more, depending on the factors mentioned above. In specific embodiments,

the dosage may range from 1.0 .g/kg up to about 20 mg/kg, optionally from 10 .g/kg up to
about 10 mg/kg or from 100 .g/kg up to about 5 mg/kg.
[004171          A therapeutic effective amount of a ST2 antigen binding protein preferably results
in a decrease in severity of disease symptoms, in an increase in frequency or duration of disease
symptom-free periods, or in a prevention of impairment or disability due to the disease affliction.

        Methods of Diagnosing or Treating a ST2-associated Disease or Disorder
[00419]          The ST2 antigen binding proteins of the invention are particularly useful for
detecting ST2 in a biological sample. In certain embodiments, a biological sample obtained from
a patient is contacted with a ST2 antigen binding protein. Binding of the ST2 antigen binding
protein to ST2 is then detected to determine the presence or relative amount of ST2 in the
sample. Such methods may be useful in diagnosing or determining patients that are amenable to
treatment with a ST2 antigen binding protein.
[00420]          In certain embodiments, a ST2 antigen binding protein of the invention is used to
diagnose, detect, or treat an autoimmune or inflammatory disorder. In treating autoimmune or
inflammatory disorders, the ST2 antigen binding protein may target ST2-expressing cells of the
immune system for destruction and/or may block the interaction of ST2 with IL-33.
[00421]          Disorders that are associated with IL-33-mediated signaling are particularly
amenable to treatment with one or more ST2 antigen binding proteins disclosed herein. Such
disorders include, but are not limited to, inflammation, autoimmune disease, paraneoplastic
autroimmune diseases, cartilage inflammation, fibrotic disease and/or bone degradation, arthritis,

[00423]          In certain embodiments, a ST2 antigen binding protein of the invention is used to
diagnose, detect, or treat a cancer or tumorigenic disorder. In treating a cancer or tumorigenic
disorder, the ST2 antigen binding protein may target ST2-expressing cells for destruction and/or
may block the interaction of ST2 with IL-33, thereby reducing IL-33 mediated signaling. For
example, high soluble ST2 expression is associated with improved survival in breast cancer
patients. (Prechtel et al, Lab Invest (2001) 81:159-165) Because soluble ST2 binds and blocks
IL-33-mediated signaling, it is contemplate that the ST2 antigen binding proteins that block IL
33-mediated signaling would be useful in promoting improved survival in breast cancer patients.
Cancer or tumorigenic disorders that may be diagnosed, detected or treated with an ST2 antigen
binding protein include, but are not limited to, solid tumors generally, lung cancer, ovarian
cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer, endometrial cancer, renal cancer, esophageal cancer,
pancreatic cancer, squamous cell carcinoma, uveal melanoma, cervical cancer, colorectal cancer,
bladder, brain, pancreatic, head, neck, liver, leukemia, lymphoma and Hodgkin's disease,
multiple myeloma, melanoma, gastric cancer, astrocytic cancer, stomach, and pulmonary
adenocarcinoma.
[00424]          The antigen binding proteins may be used to inhibit tumor growth, progression,
and/or metastasis. Such inhibition can be monitored using various methods. For instance,
inhibition can result in reduced tumor size and/or a decrease in metabolic activity within a tumor.

Both of these parameters can be measured by MRI or PET scans, for example. Inhibition can
also be monitored by biopsy to ascertain the level of necrosis, tumor cell death, and the level of
vascularity within the tumor. The extent of metastasis can be monitored using known methods.
                                           EXAMPLES
[004251          The following examples, both actual and prophetic, are provided for the purpose
of illustrating specific embodiments or features of the present invention and are not intended to
limit its scope.
EXAMPLE 1: ST2 Antibodies are Efficacious in an Animal Model of Asthma
[00426]          This example demonstrates that administering antibodies that bind ST2 and inhibit
IL-33-mediated signaling are efficacious in an animal model of an inflammatory disease, i.e.,
asthma. A neutralizing mouse ST2 mAb (ST2 surrogate mAb) inhibited the activity of
exogenously administered IL-33 in vivo. Mice were administered 200 ng of recombinant mouse
IL-33 intranasally two hours after intravenous injection of 100 ug of anti-ST2 mAb. The next
day, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) IL-5 concentrations were measured by ELISA.
Baseline IL-5 concentrations were obtained from the BALF of mice treated with saline before
saline challenge. Maximum BALF IL-5 concentrations were obtained from isotype control Ig
treated mice challenged with IL-33. Compared to isotype control Ig treatment, ST2 mAb
treatment significantly inhibited IL-33-induced IL-5 in the BALF of both BALB/c and C57BL/6
mouse strains (FIG. 1).
[004271          The ST2 surrogate mAb was efficacious in a cockroach allergen (CRA)-induced
model of asthma, with ST2 antibody-treated mice having significantly fewer BALF eosinophils
than isotype control Ig-treated mice. BALB/c mice were challenged with 100 gg CRA on days
1, 3, 6, 8, 10, and 13. Mice were injected with 250 gg of either anti-ST2 mAb or isotype control
Ig on days 0, 7, and 13, with the day 13 antibody injection occurring before the final intranasal
CRA challenge. On day 14, the mice were anesthetized and subjected to lung lavage. BALF cell
populations were enumerated and treatment with anti-ST2 mAb resulted in the presence of
significantly fewer total BALF cells, with eosinophils comprising the significantly impacted cell
population (FIG. 2).
EXAMPLE 2: Production of anti-ST2 Antibodies Using the Xenomouse@ Platform
[00428]          The generation of fully human antibodies directed against human ST2 was carried
out using XENOMOUSE@ technology (United States Patent Nos. 6,114,598; 6,162,963;

[00429]         Immunizations of XMG2K, XMG4K and XMG4KL XENOMOUSE@ animals
were carried out with either a polypeptide comprising the extracellular domain of human ST2
fused to a human antibody Fc domain or with the human ST2-Fc fusion protein complexed with
human IL-33. A suitable amount of immunogen (i.e., ten [tg/mouse of soluble ST2) was used for
initial immunization of XENOMOUSE@ animals according to the methods disclosed in U.S.
Patent Application Serial No. 08/759,620, filed December 3, 1996 and International Patent
Application Nos. WO 98/24893, published June 11, 1998 and WO 00/763 10, published
December 21, 2000, the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference. Following
the initial immunization, subsequent boost immunizations of immunogen (five gg/mouse of
either soluble ST2 or ST2/IL33 complex) were administered on a schedule and for the duration
necessary to induce a suitable titer of anti-ST2 antibody in the mice. Titers were determined a
suitable method, for example, ELISA or by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACs).
[00430]         Animals exhibiting suitable titers were identified, and lymphocytes obtained from
draining lymph nodes and, when necessary, pooled for each cohort. Lymphocytes were
dissociated from lymphoid tissue by grinding in a suitable medium (for example, Dulbecco's
Modified Eagle Medium; DMEM; obtainable from Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) to release the cells
from the tissues, and suspended in DMEM. B cells were selected and/or expanded using a
suitable method, and fused with a suitable fusion partner, for example, nonsecretory myeloma
P3X63Ag8.653 cells (American Type Culture Collection CRL 1580; Kearney et al, J. Immunol.
123, 1979, 1548-1550), using techniques that are known in the art.
[00431]         In one fusion method, lymphocytes were mixed with fusion partner cells at a ratio
of 1:4. The cell mixture was gently pelleted by centrifugation at 400 x g for 4 minutes, the
supernatant decanted, and the cell mixture gently mixed (for example, by using a 1 mL pipette).
Fusion was induced with PEG/DMSO (polyethylene glycol/dimethyl sulfoxide; obtainable from
Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis MO; 1 mL per million of lymphocytes). PEG/DMSO was slowly
added with gentle agitation over one minute followed, by one minute of mixing. IDMEM
(DMEM without glutamine; 2 mL per million of B cells), was then added over 2 minutes with
gentle agitation, followed by additional IDMEM (8 mL per million B-cells) which was added
over 3 minutes.

[004321         The fused cells were gently pelleted (400 x g 6 minutes) and resuspended in 20
mL Selection media (DMEM containing Azaserine and Hypoxanthine [HA] and other
supplemental materials as necessary) per million B-cells. Cells were incubated for 20-30 minutes
at 37'C and then re-suspended in 200 mL Selection media and cultured for three to four days in
T175 flasks prior to 96 well plating.
[00433]         Cells were distributed into 96-well plates using standard techniques to maximize
clonality of the resulting colonies. After several days of culture, supernatants were collected
and subjected to screening assays. The hybridoma supernatants generated from mice immunized
with the ST2-Fc/IL33 complex were screened with an ELISA-based assay performed using 96
well polystyrene ELISA plates passively coated overnight at 4'C with 0.5ug/ mL of ST2-Flag/his
complexed to human IL-33. To determine ST-2 specific binding, a second ELISA screen was
performed using 96-well polystyrene plates passively coated overnight at 4'C with 1Oug/ mL of
neutravidin. Plates were then washed and loaded with 0.5ug/ mL biotinylated human IL33.
This ELISA screen identified over 1200 anti-ST2 specific binders.
[00434]         Hybridoma supernatants generated from mice immunized with soluble ST2-Fc
were screened for ST2 antigen specific antibodies by Fluorometric Microvolume Assay
Technology (FMAT) by screening against recombinant HEK293T cells transiently transfected
with full-length human ST2 and counter-screening against mock-transfected HEK293T cells.
Briefly, the cells were seeded into 384-well FMAT plates in a volume of 40ul/well at a density of
6,000 ST2 positive cells/well and 14,000 mock transfected ST2 negative cells/well. Hybridoma
supernatant was then added and allowed to bind for Ihour at room temperature followed by a
wash and secondary detection using anti-Human Fc-Cy5 secondary antibody. This FMAT
screen identified over 2200 anti-ST2 specific binders from hybridomas generated from mice
immunized with the extracellular domain of ST2.
[004351         This combined panel of 3400 anti-ST2 specific hybridoma supernatants were then
further characterized for the ability to functional antagonize ST2 signalling using a Interferon-y
cytokine release assay. Briefly, either purified human peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMNCs) or purified human NK cells were seeded into 96well tissue culture plates and
stimulated with human IL-33 and IL-12, inducing the release of interferon-gamma into the
supernatant.    Interferon-gamma levels in the supernatant were quantified and were directly
correlated to Il-33/ST2 dependant signalling. Using this bioassay, hybridoma samples were
tested for the ability to block interferon-gamma release through blockade of the ST2 signalling
pathway. This screen identified 578 hybridoma supernatants generated from the ST2-Fc
immunization that inhibited interferon-gamma release by greater than 80%. In addition, 505

hybridoma supernatants generated from the ST2Fc/IL-33 complex immunization were identified
that inhibited interferon-gamma release by greater than 70%.
[004361         This panel of 1083 hybridoma supernatants was then further characterized for
cross-reactive binding to mouse and cynomolgus monkey ST2, for relative affinity ranking by
limited antigen ELISA, for biochemical receptor/ligand blocking by ELISA and for endogenous
binding by FACs using cell lines. The data generated in these secondary assays was used to
diversify the large panel into 2 sets of 40 hybridoma lines which were advanced to sub-cloning,
scale-up and purification.
EXAMPLE 3: KD Determinations
[004371         In this example, the affinity of ST2-binding antibodies was determined. Surface
plasmon resonance evaluations were carried out using a Proteon XPR-36 optical biosensor
equipped with a GLC sensor chip (Bio-Rad). Biosensor analysis was conducted at 25 0 C in a
HBS-EP+ (iX) buffer system (10 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 3.0 mM EDTA, 0.05%
Surfactant P20, GE Heathcare). All reagents were kept at 8 0C prior to injection.
[00438]         Goat anti-human IgG (Fc fragment specific, Jackson ImmunoResearch) was
immobilized to the sensor surface in the vertical direction via standard amine coupling to lanes 1
6 (~4000 RU) and then blocked with ethanolamine. The antibodies were captured (~40-100 RU)
in the vertical direction to lanes 1-5. Vertical lane 6 was left blank and used for reference
purposes. The data were collected in groups of 15 antibodies (three sets of 5).
[00439]         The ST2 reagents (human or cyno) were prepared in running buffer to a
concentration of 25 nM and then diluted 3-fold to 309 pM. A single injection along the
horizontal direction delivered a full concentration series of each ST2 molecule, using buffer to
complete a row of six samples and provide an in-line blank for double-referencing the response
data. The association (3 min) and dissociation (30 min) rates were monitored at a flow rate of
100 uL/min.
[00440]         The surface was regenerated at a flow rate of 100 uL/min with 10 mM glycine
(pH 1.5, 30 uL).
[00441]         The data were baseline corrected, cropped, aligned, reference subtracted
(interspot), and then fit to a 1:1 binding model using ProteOn Manager (version 2.1.2.05). The
results are shown in Table 4.

 [004421         The affinity of additional antibodies were determined using a slightly modified
Plasmon resonance protocol. The surface plasmon resonance evaluations for the antibodies Ab 1,
Ab2, Ab3, and Ab4 were conducted at 25'C using a Biacore 3000 instrument (Biacore
International AB, Uppsala, Sweden) equipped with a CM5 sensor chip. Anti-Fcy specific capture
antibodies were covalently immobilized to two flow cells on the CM4 chip using standard amine
coupling chemistry with HBS-EP ((10 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 3 mM EDTA,
0.005% Surfactant P20, GE Heathcare) as the running buffer. Briefly, each flow cell was
activated with a 1:1 (v/v) mixture of 0.1 M NHS and 0.4 M EDC. AffiniPure Goat Anti-Human
IgG, Fcy Fragment Specific antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Inc. West Grove, PA) at 30
ug/ml in 1OmM sodium acetate, pH 5.0 was immobilized with a target level of 3,000 RUs on two
flow cells. Residual reactive surfaces were deactivated with an injection of 1 M ethanolamine.
The running buffer was then switched to HBS-EP + 0.1 mg/ml BSA for all remaining steps.

[004431          All antibodies were prepared in running buffer in triplicate and diluted 3-fold, and
injected so that a three minute injection at 10 gl/min over the test flow cell resulted in
approximately 75 - 90 response units of antibody captured on the test flow cell surface. No
antibody was captured on the control flow cell surface. Human or cyno ST2 at various
concentrations (200 nM - 0.0914 nM) , along with buffer blanks were then flown over the two
flow cells. A flow rate of 50 ul/min was used and a two minute association phase followed by a
four min dissociation phase. After each cycle the surfaces were regenerated with a 50 uL
injection of 10 mM glycine pH 1.5. Fresh antibody was then captured on the test flow cell to
prepare for the next cycle. A separate long dissociation experiment (60 min) was performed in
triplicate at a concentration of 200 nM.
[00444]          Data was double referenced by subtracting the control surface responses to
remove bulk refractive index changes, and then subtracting the averaged buffer blank response to
remove systematic artifacts from the experimental flow cells. The ST2 data were processed and
globally fit to a 1:1 interaction model with a local Rmax in BIA evaluation Software v 4.1.

EXAMPLE 4: pH-Sensitive Binding of Antibodies
[00445]         Therapeutic antibodies that bind with decrease affinity at low pH to their targets
may have enhanced PK properties that will allow them to be delivered less frequently or at lower
doses. (Nat Biotechnol. 2010 28(11):1203-7 T. Igawa et al Antibody recycling by engineered
pH-dependent antigen binding improves the duration of antigen neutralization) This is due to
target release by the antibody at the low pH of the lyzosome, followed by subsequent target
degradation and antibody recycling.
[00446]         Biosensor analysis of the pH sensitive binding of the antibodies AbI, Ab2, Ab3,
and Ab4 was carried out on a Biacore 4000. The setup was similar to Example 3, where the KD
measurements of these antibodies were conducted, except that data was fit for a duplicate
injection of a single concentration of 2.46 nM of a-ST2 antibody. The association (5 min) rates
at pH 7.4 and dissociation (10 min) rates at pH 5.5 and 7.4 were monitored at a flow rate of 30
uL/min. The reference subtracted data was fit to a 1:1 model in Scrubber. Several of the
antibodies displayed dramatically faster off rates at lower pH, as shown in Table 6.

EXAMPLE 5: Antibody Cross-Competition
[004471         A common way to characterize epitopes is through competition experiments.
Antibodies that compete with each other can be thought of as binding the same site on the target.
This example describes a method of determining competition for binding to ST2 and the results
of the method when applied to a number of antibodies described herein.
[00448]         Binning experiments can be conducted in a number of ways, and the method
employed may have an effect on the assay results. Common to these methods is that ST2 is
typically bound by one reference antibody and probed by another. If the reference antibody
prevents the binding of the probe antibody then the antibodies are said to be in the same bin. The
                                               -10M3-

order in which the antibodies are employed is important. If antibody A is employed as the
reference antibody and blocks the binding of antibody B the converse is not always true:
antibody B used as the reference antibody will not necessarily block antibody A. There are a
number of factors in play here: the binding of an antibody can cause conformational changes in
the target which prevent the binding of the second antibody, or epitopes which overlap but do not
completely occlude each other may allow for the second antibody to still have enough high
affinity interactions with the target to allow binding. In general, if competition is observed in
either order the antibodies are said to bin together, and if both antibodies can block each other
then it is likely that the epitopes overlap more completely.
[00449]           For this Example, a modification of the Multiplexed Binning method described by
Jia, et al (J. Immunological Methods, 288 (2004) 91-98) was used. Soluble ST2-FLAG His was
used. Each Bead Code of streptavidin-coated Luminex beads (Luminex, #L100-L1XX-O1, XX
specifies the bead code) was incubated in 100ul of 6pg/bead biotinylated monovalent mouse-anti
human IgG capture antibody (BD Pharmingen, #555785 ) for 1 hour at room temperature in the
dark, then washed 3x with PBSA, phosphate buffered saline (PBS) plus 1% bovine serum
albumin (BSA). Each bead code was separately incubated with 100 ul of a 1:10 dilution anti
ST2 antibody (Coating Antibody) for 1 hour then washed. The beads were pooled then
dispensed to a 96-well filter plate (Millipore, #MSBVN1250).       100ul of 2ug/ml ST2 was added
to half the wells and buffer to the other half and incubated for 1 hour then washed. 100 ul of a
1:10 dilution anti-ST2 antibody (Detection Ab) was added to one well with ST2 and one well
without ST2, incubated for 1 hour then washed. An irrelevant human-IgG (Jackson, #009-000
003) as well as a no antibody condition (blank) were run as negative controls. 20ul PE
conjugated monovalent mouse-anti-human IgG (BD Pharmingen, #555787) was added to each
well and incubated for 1 hour then washed. Beads were resuspended in 75ul PBSA and at least
100 events/bead code were collected on the BioPlex instrument (BioRad).
[004501           Median Fluorescent Intensity (MFI) of the antibody pair without ST2 was
subtracted from signal of the corresponding reaction containing ST2. For the antibody pair to be
considered bound simultaneously, and therefore in different bins, the value of the reaction had to
meet two criteria: 1) the values had to be 2 times greater than the coating antibody paired with
itself, the irrelevant or the blank, whichever was highest, and 2) the values had to be greater than
the signal of the detection antibody present with the irrelevant or the blank coated bead. A
minimum of three bins were found as shown in Table 7 below.

EXAMPLE 6: IL-33-Blocking Assays
[00451]         The mechanism of action of the ST2 antibodies was explored using two
AlphaScreens.     In combination, the assays were used to determine if the antibodies could inhibit
the association of IL-33 with ST2 or in contrast if the antibodies could specifically block the
association of the co-receptors ST2 and AcP while still allowing IL-33 to associate with ST2.
AlphaScreen is an acronym for Amplified Luminescent Proximity Homogenous Assay screen.
[00452]         In the first screen, antibodies were evaluated for the ability to block an association
between IL-33 and ST2. This assay measured the ability of the anti-ST2 antibodies to block the
association of biotinylated human IL-33 (coupled with a Streptavidin donor bead) with
6xhistidine tagged human ST2 (coupled with a Ni-chelate acceptor bead). The IL-33/ST2
AlphaScreen was conducted using 40ul reactions in a 96 well half area plate (Perkin Elmer).
The assay buffer that was used for both AlphaScreens contained 40mM HEPES (pH=7.4), 1mM

CaCl2, 0.1% BSA, 0.05% Tween-20 and 100mM NaCl.             Each assay well contained 0.3nM
biotinylated human IL-33, 0.3nM human ST2-FH (FH stands for FLAG and 6xHistidine tags),
1 Oug/ml Streptavidin coated donor beads (Perkin Elmer, Waltham,MA), 1Oug/ml Ni-chelate
coated acceptor beads (Perkin Elmer) and 12.5ug/ml of an anti-ST2 Ab. After the addition of all
assay components the plates were incubated overnight in the dark at room temperature. The
next day the plates were read on a 2103 Envision multilabel reader (Perkin Elmer).       Laser
excitation of the donor beads at 680nm was used to generate reactive oxygen that could initiate a
luminescent/fluorescent cascade in the acceptor beads that were in close proximity due to the
interaction of the bead coupled proteins resulting in the emission of light which was detected at
570nm.
[00453]         In the second assay, antibodies were evaluated for the ability to inhibit the IL-33
mediated association of ST2 with the co-receptor AcP. This assay measured the ability of the
anti-ST2 antibodies to block the IL-33 mediated association of biotinylated human ST2-Fc
(coupled with a Streptavidin donor bead) with 6xhistidine tagged human AcP (coupled with a Ni
chelate acceptor bead). The ST2/AcP AlphaScreen was conducted in 8ul reactions in a 384 well
optiplate (Perkin Elmer). Each assay well contained 5nM human IL-33, 5nM biotinylated human
ST2-Fc, 5nM human AcP-FH, 1Oug/ml Streptavidin coated donor beads, 1Oug/ml Ni-chelate
coated acceptor beads and 12.5ug/ml of an anti-ST2 Ab. After the addition of all assay
components the plates were incubated overnight in the dark at room temperature. The next day
the plates were read on a 2103 Envision multilable reader (Perkin Elmer) using the same
parameters as above for the first assay.
[00454]         The results of the two AlphaScreens are presented in Table 8 below. The
inhibition of each antibody is presented as the percentage of inhibition of signal in the
AlphaScreen using a given antibody at a concentration of 12.5ug/ml relative to the signal in the
assay when no antibody was included in the assay well. Some antibodies inhibited the ST2 and
IL-33 interaction more completely than they inhibited the ST2/IL-33/AcP interaction and some
antibodies inhibited the ST2/IL-33/AcP interaction more completely than the ST2 and IL-33
interaction. All antibodies inhibited the IL-33 interaction with ST2 by at least 50%.

EXAMPLE 7: In Vitro Human IL-33 Bioassay
[00455]         Exemplary ST2 human mAbs were tested in a human bioassay utilizing purified
CD4+ T cells obtained from various donors stimulated with human IL-33 and human IL-2. The
procedure for the assay is as follows. Cells are seeded at 250,000 cells per well in 60 ul volume
in a 96 well round bottom plate. After preincubation, add 30 ul of 4x mixture of huIL-2 + huIL
33 to each well. Total volume in 96-well round bottom plate is 120 ul. Start antibodies at 20
ug/ml and do 1:3 dilutions to generate 10 point curve. Make 4x in 30 ul. After preincubation of
Abs with cells, add 30 ul of 4x mixture of huIL-2 + huIL-33 to each well. 37'C, 5% C02 for 48
hours. Harvest supernatants. Analyze inhibition of IL-5 by huIL-5 ELISA.
[00456]         Figure 3 shows ST2 mAbs in the inhibition of human IL-33-induced IL-5
production from CD4+ T cells from various donors. The ( -       ) line depicts the positive control
value of human IL-33 in combination with human IL-2 without inhibition. The ( .          ) depicts
the positive control value of human IL-2. The ( - - ) line depicts the media control value.
Human CD4+ T cells were preincubated for 30 minutes with anti-ST2 mAbs and then stimulated
for 48 hours with human IL-33 (4 ng/ml) and human IL-2 (10 ng/ml). FIG 3 shows that ST2
antibodies are able to inhibit human IL-33-induced ST2 activation, as determined by IL-5
production from CD4+ T cells. The ST2 antibodies were able to antagonize IL-33 induced IL-5
production from CD4+ T cells with IC50s of approximately <100 nM. Table 9 shows
representative IC50 values.

(Gallard-Schlesinger Industries, Plainview, NY) gradient centrifugation. Subsequent isolation of
cynomolgus monkey CD4+ T cells was performed using Miltenyi Biotec's cynomolgus monkey
CD4+ T cell Isolation Kit. Isolated cyno CD4+ T cells (2x 105 cells/well in 96 well plates) were
incubated with purified monoclonal antibodies at various concentrations for 30 minutes at room
temperature and then stimulated with IL-33 (10 ng/mL), IL-2 (10 ng/mL), and IL-12p70
(50ng/mL) for eighty-four hours. The resulting cell-free cynomolgus monkey CD4+ T cell
culture supernatants were then analyzed for the presence of cynomolgus monkey IFNy by ELISA
(example data is provided in Table 10). The potency of purified monoclonal antibodies was
determined in the cynomolgus monkey CD4+ T cell IFNy release assay from three separate
donors.

Subsequent isolation of eosinophils was performed using Miltenyi Biotec's Eosinophil Isolation
Kit. Isolated eosinophils (2x10 5 cells/well in 96 well plates) were incubated with non-clonal or
clonal supernatants at several dilutions, or purified monoclonal antibodies at various
concentrations for 30 minutes at room temperature and then stimulated with IL-33 (2 ng/mL) and
IL-3 (100 ng/mL) for three days. The resulting cell-free eosinophil culture supernatants were

EXAMPLE 10: Potency of Anti-ST2 Antibody Compared to Commercially Available Antibodies
        Dose response of human IL-33 in human NK cell assay
[004591         Primary CD56-positive human NK cells (5 x 10e4 cells) were treated with human
IL-12 (1 ng/mL) plus increasing amounts of human IL-33, as shown in FIG. 4. Twenty-two
hours later, cell-free supernatants were collected and measured for IFN-y concentration using a
commercial assay (R&D Systems). 10 ng/mL IL-33 was used as the stimulation dose for the ST2
antibody inhibition.

[00461]         EXAMPLE 11: Alanine/Arginine Scanning Mutagenesis of ST2
[00462]         This Example characterizes ST2 antibodies based on the effect of mutagenesis of
ST2 on their ability to bind the target. Previous binding data indicated that ST2 domains 1 and 2
are primarily responsible for antibody binding for the panel of antibodies analyzed by ST2
scanning mutagenesis in this Example. As such, only domains 1 and 2 (D1D2) of ST2 were
considered structurally in the context of the full length ST2 in the designs of mutation sites.
[00463]         The ST2 and IL-33 complex model coordinates were obtained from Lingel et al.,
Structure (London, England: 1993). Elsevier Ltd 17, 1398-410. The per residue sidechain solvent
accessibility of ST2 was calculated in the Molecular Operating Environment (Molecular
OperatingEnvironment (MOE), 2011.10; Chemical Computing Group Inc., 1010 Sherbooke St.
West, Suite #910, Montreal, QC, Canada, H3A 2R7, 2011.). These solvent accessibility values
were then used in the selection of D1D2 surface residues for mutagenesis by first selecting all
D1 D2 residues with sidechain exposures of at least 10 A 2 or glycine residues with total exposures
of at least 10 A2 . Glycine residues with a positive Phi angle were removed, as were proline
residues, since mutations at such positions have a higher probability of distorting the local
protein structure. Cysteine residues were also removed from the selection to maintain disulfide
linkages. Residue A82 was removed after visual inspection. This method produced a list of 140

residues for mutagenesis. All residues were mutated to arginine except for arginine and lysine
residues, which were mutated to alanine.
[00464]          All mutant constructs of parental His-Avi-tagged ST2 extracellular domain
(ECD), in pTT5 vector, were expressed in transiently transfected 293-6E suspension cells
(NRCC) in 24-well plates. In-vivo biotinylation was achieved by co-transfection of BiR A in
pTT5 vector. The supernatants were dialyzed with PBS to remove excess biotin.
[004651          BioPlex binding assay is used to measure binding of anti-ST2 antibodies to point
mutations of ST2. The biotinylated mutants were bound onto 80 bead codes of streptavidin
coated beads (Luminex, #L100-L1XX-01, XX specifies the bead code). The 80 bead codes
allowed the multiplexing of two sets of 70 mutants for 140 total. Each set included 6 parental
controls, 3 irrelevant protein controls and 1 blank. Antibody binding to mutant protein was
compared to antibody binding to the parental.
[00466]          100ul of a 1:7 dilution of the ST2 mutants, parental and controls or no protein pre
bound to the beads were washed 5X with PBS +1% BSA, pooled and aliquoted into a 96-well
filter plate (Millipore) then washed again. 100ul anti-ST2 antibodies in 3-fold dilutions were
added to triplicate wells, incubated for 1 hour at RT and washed. 100ul of 1:500 dilution of PE
conjugated anti-human IgG Fc (Jackson, #109-116-170) was added to each well, incubated for
0.5 hour and washed. Beads were resuspended in 75 uL, shaken for at least 3mins, and read on
the BioPlex.
[004671          Before running the binding assay, a validation experiment was conducted to assess
the "bead region" to "bead region" (B-B) variability. In the validation experiment, all beads
were conjugated with the same wild-type control protein. Therefore, the difference between
beads regions was due to purely B-B variance and was not confounded by difference between
wild type and mutant proteins. The titration of antibody was run with twelve replications in
different wells.
[00468]          The objective of this statistical analysis was to estimate the B-B variability of the
estimated EC50 of binding curves. The estimated B-B standard deviation (SD) was then used to
build the EC50 confidence intervals of wild type and mutant proteins during curve comparison
experiments.
[00469]          A four-parameter logistic model was fitted to the binding data for each bead
region. The resulting "sumout.xls" file, containing curve quality control (QC) results and
parameter estimates for top (max), bottom (min), Hillslope (slope), and natural log of EC50
(xmid) of the curves, was used as the raw data for the analysis. B-B variability for each
parameter was then estimated by fitting mixed effect model using SAS PROC MIXED

procedure. Only curves with "good" QC status were included in the analysis. The final mixed
effect model included only residual (i.e. individual bead regions) as random effect. Least squares
means (LS-mean) for each parameter were estimated by the mixed effect model as well. B-B SD
was calculated by taking square root of B-B variance. Fold change between LS-mean + 2SD and
LS-mean - 2SD, which represent approximately upper and lower 97.5 percentile of the
population, was also calculated.
[004701          To identify mutants that did not produce much response relative to WT control,
for each antibody, mutants where max (MFI) are less than 30% of the max(MFI) for WT control
are identified and flagged as Hitmax.
[004711          The EC50s of the mutant binding curves and wild type binding curves were
compared. Statistically significant differences were identified as hits for further consideration.
The curves with "nofit" or "badfit" flags were excluded from this analysis.
[00472]          Two sources of variations are considered in the comparison of EC50 estimates,
variation from the curve fit and the bead-bead variation. Wild types and mutants were linked to
different beads, hence their difference are confounded with the bead-bead difference. The curve
fit variation is estimated by the standard error of the log EC50 estimates. Bead-bead variation is
experimentally determined using an experiment where wild type controls were linked to each one
of the beads. The bead variation in EC50 estimates of wild type binding curve from this
experiment is used to estimate the bead-bead variation in the actual mapping experiment.
[00473]          The comparisons of two EC50s (in log scale) are conducted using Student's t-test.
A t-statistics is calculated as the ratio between delta (the absolute differences between EC50
estimates) and the standard deviation of delta. The variance of delta is estimated by the sum of
the three components, variance estimate of EC50 for mutant and wild type curves in the
nonlinear regression and two times the bead-bead variance estimated from a separate experiment.
The multiple of two for the bead-bead variance is due to the assumption that both mutant and
wild type beads have the same variance.
[00474]          The degree of freedom of the standard deviation of delta was calculated using the
Satterthwaite's (1946) approximation.
[004751          Individual p-values and confidence intervals (95% and 99%) were derived based
on Student's t distribution for each comparison.
[00476]          In the case of multiple wild type controls, a conservative approach was taken by
picking the wild type control that was most similar to the mutant, i.e., picking the ones with the
largest p-values.

[004771          Multiplicity adjustments are important to control the false positive while
conducting a large number of tests simultaneously. Two forms of multiplicity adjustment were
implemented for this analysis: family wise error (FWE) control and false discovery rate (FDR)
control. The FWE approach controls the probability that one or more hits are not real; FDR
approach controls the expected proportion of false positive among the selected hits. The former
approach is more conservative and less powerful than the latter one. There are many methods
available for both approaches, for this analysis, we chose Hochberg's (1988) method for FWE
analysis and Benjamini-Hochberg's (1995) FDR method for FDR analysis. Adjusted p-values
for both approaches are calculated either for each antibody or the whole assay.
[00478]          A mutant was selected as having an effect by the following criteria if: 1) a bad fit
or no fit results was returned for that mutant, 2) the mutant was selected for the hitmax criteria, 3)
the family wise error pValue was less than 0.01, or 4) the Bmax value was greater than 200% of
parental. A hit was designated as an inhibitor if the effect reduced Bmax or increased the EC50
value, a hit was designated as an activator if it increased Bmax or decreased the EC50 value. 8
mutation were excluded from the hit list due to their effect on >90% of the antibodies tested, they
are: K37A, R46A, D63R, V71R, G106R, KI 12A, N132R, Q137R, and Y141R.

[00481]         Soluble ST2 protein (domains 1-3 containing amino acids 19-322 of SEQ ID
NO: 1) with both FLAG-tag and His-tag on the C-terminus was transiently expressed in
mammalian 293-6E cells and purified with IMAC (immobilized metal ion affinity
chromatography) and further purified by preparative SEC (size exclusion chromatography). The
protein was then concentrated to 3.5 mg/mL using ultra-filtration. ST2 antibody Ab2 was
expressed in engineered CHO-CS9 cells and purified with protein A affinity chromatography
followed by preparative SEC. Analytical SEC was used to determine that a 0.75:1.00 molar ratio
of antibody:antigen was optimal to ensure that the ST2 protein is fully bound to the antibody.
Both the free ST2 protein and the antigen-antibody complex were stored in PBS buffer, pH 7.2.
[00482]         The HDX experiment was performed on an automated HDX system (Zhang,
Zhang et al. 2012). Briefly, the H/D exchange process starts with diluting 5uL of either the free
ST2 protein solution (3.5 mg/mL) or ST2-antibody complex (with jST2 concentration of 3.5
mg/mL, antigen:antibody ratio of 1:0.75) into 25 uL D2 0 buffer in 100mM PBS, pH 7.2, which
was prepared by dissolving PBS tablet in D2 0 water, at 25 0C. The exchange reaction was
allowed to insubate for various labeling duration (30 seconds, 2, 8, 30 min, and 2, 8 hours) for
each HDX experiment, and the labeling reaction was quenched by mixing 20 gL labeling
solution with 80 gL quenching/denaturation/reduction buffer (7.25 M urea and 625 mM tris(2
carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP), 0.45M glycine, pH 2.7) at 10C.
[00483]         A 40 gL aliquot of quenched solution was transferred into 120 gL 0.4 mg/mL
porcine pepsin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) solution. The digestion solution was immediately
injected into a sample loop at 10C and stayed 6 min for full digestion. Furthermore, the digest
was separated by C18 columns (3 columns in series, BEH C18, 2.1mmx5mm, Waters Corp.,
Milford, MA). The HPLC separation was performed at 1 C with a 5-min ACN gradient of 1
40%. The LC eluant was analyzed by an Orbitrap Elite mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific,
San Jose, CA) in a data-dependent LC-MS/MS experiment.
[00484]         Deuterium labeling, quenching, proteolytic digestion and injection were
performed on a LEAP HD-X PAL system controlled by LEAP Shells (LEAP Technologies,
Carrboro, NC).
[004851         The experiments were repeated three times and in each experiment, each time
point was repeated twice. A standard peptide mixture was added to the samples to track and
correct back-exchange variability. The mixture contains these three peptides: bradykinin,
angiotensin I, and leucine enkephalin. A specially designed tetrapeptide PPPI (synthesized by
AnaSpec, Fremont, CA) was used as second internal standard to minimize run to run variability.
Digest of ST2 protein without H/D exchange was also analyzed as control.

    WO 2013/173761                                                            PCT/US2013/041656
[004861            The resulting data files were processed with the MassAnalyzer program (Zhang,
Zhang et al. 2012). The software identifies peptides from the antigen digest, calculates the
exchange rate of each peptide, corrects for back-exchange information obtained from the internal
standards, and fits the data into a model that gives protection factors to each residue.
[004871            Comparison of the exchange profiles between free ST2 and antibody-bound ST2
protein revealed two regions of interest and could be the potential epitope. The two regions in
the ST2 sequence were refined to IVRCPRQGKPSY (amino acids 3 3-44 of SEQ ID NO: 1
corresonding to amino acids 15-26 of mature ST2) and IVRSPTF (amino acids 88-94 of SEQ ID
NO: 1 corrsponding to amino acids 70-76 of mature ST2) by multiple overlapped peptides. These
regions were less protected when ST2 is in the free-state, while the exchange rate decreases
dramatically upon binding of ST2 and the antibody. Furthermore, based on ST2 homology
structure model shown in Figure 6, these two sequence stretches occupy similar spatial locations
on the exterior surface of the protein. These results lead to the conclusion that the two peptides
are involved in the binding between Ab2 and ST2 protein.
EXAMPLE 13: X-ray Crystallography
[00488]            In this Example, the crystal structure of the complex of an sc-dsFv fragment of
Ab2 and ST2 provides the specific amino acid residues in the interaction interface.
[00489]            Ab2 sc-dsFv was expressed in BL2I(DEi)_Star cells. Briefly, the Ab2 sc-dsFv
contains the heavy chain variable domain connected to the light chain variable domain by a
linker (G 4 S) 3 . To further stabilize the molecule, a disulfide bond was engineered into the
molecule by mutating to cysteine position 44 of the heavy chain variable region and position 101
of the light chain variable region. The protein was expressed as an inclusion body. The
inclusion body was solubilized and refolded. Protein was further purified on size exclusion
column (SEC) and ion- exchange MonoQ column, and then polished on SEC .
[00490]            ST2 was expressed in 293S cells. The protein was purified by Ni-affinity column
and deglycosylated with EndoH. Protein was further purified on SEC.
[00491]            The complex of Ab2 sc-dsFv and ST2 was formed by mixing Ab2 sc-dsFv and
excess ST2. The complex was purified on SEC and concentrated to 12 mg/ml for crystallization.
The protein complex was crystallized in 32-36% PEG400 and 0.1 M Hepes, pH 7.5-8.5, at 16 'C
using sitting drop vapor diffusion method.
[00492]            A 1.9 A resolution dataset was collected at the Advanced Light Source, Lawrence
Berkeley National Lab (Berkeley, CA). The data was processed with MOSFLM (Leslie, 1992)
and scaled by SCALA in CCP4 program suite (Collaborative Computational Project, No 4.
(1994)). The structure was solved by molecular replacement method with program PHASER
                                                   -117-

(McCoy et al., 2007) using the D1D2 domain of the published structure of IL-1RII (pdb code:
3040) and the variable domain of the Fab structure of Ab2 as search models. Iterative structure
refinement and model building were carried out in with REFMAC5 (Murshudov et al., 1997) and
COOT (Ernsiey and Cowtan, 2004).
[00493]          The interface analysis was carried out with program PISA, AREAMOL and
NCONTACT in CCP4 package. The figures were prepared with Pymol (The PyMOL Molecular
Graphics System. Schr6dinger).
[00494]          The crystal structure of the ST2/Ab2 sc-dsFv complex was solved to a resolution
of 1.9 A. There are two independent pairs of ST2/Ab2 sc-dsFv complexes in the asymmetric
unit (FIG. 7). Each complex consists of one ST2 molecule and one Ab2 sc-dsFv fragment. The
ST2 molecule is made of two IgG-like domains (D1 and D2 domain). The Ab2 Fv domain
utilizes all six CDR loops of the heavy chain and light chain to interact with the ST2 molecule
(FIG. 8). For ST2, two loops (loop BC and loop FG) and the N-terminus of ST2 make direct
interactions with the antibody. The total buried solvent accessible surface area between ST2 and
Ab2 sc-dsFv is 1803 A2 .
[004951          The interface between ST2 and Ab2 is highly charged. ST2 possess a cluster of
basic residues (Lys and Arg) in the D1 domain. This positive-charged surface patch
complements the negative-charged patch on Ab2 formed by clusters of acidic residues (Asp and
Glu) in the CDR regions (FIG. 9).
[00496]          Two different methods were used to define the interface residues.   In the first
method, the interface residues were defined using solvent exposure difference. The solvent
accessible surface area of each residue in ST2 (or Ab2 sc-dsFv) in the complex was calculated
and compared to the solvent accessible surface area of the corresponding residues in ST2 (or Ab2
sc-dsFv) stripped from complex.       All amino acids with difference greater than 10% are listed in
Table 15 and Table 16 for ST2 and Ab2, respectively. The surface exposure differences of
Arg72 and Tyr81 of ST2 are less than 10%. However, inspection of the complex structure
revealed that both residues form water-mediated hydrogen bonds with Ab2 heavy chain residues
and hence they are included in the list.

[00502]                         The ST2 epitope regions obtained from HDX-MS analysis of Example 12 are
confirmed by the crystallography data. The two epitopes (15-26 and 70-76) from HDX were
identified as epitopes in the higher resolution crystallography data. Specifically, Arg20, Gly22,
Lys23 and Tyr26, as well as Thr75 were identified to be close to the antibody with a distance of
less than 3.4 A. Additional residues that were identified to have a distance to the antibody
between 3.4 and 5 A (Prol9, Gln21, Ile70, Val71, Arg72, Ser73 Pro74 and Phe76) were also
covered in the HDX epitopes.
[00503]                         Overall, the results confirmed that ST2 epitope regions obtained from both HDX
MS and crystallography are consistent. The BC loop and FG loop in Domain 1 (see
crystallography data) are the main interaction sites.
