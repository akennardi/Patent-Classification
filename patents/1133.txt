                        OSTEOCLAST INHIBITORS FOR PAIN
                                        SUMMARY
        [0001]    Bisphosphonate compounds are potent inhibitors of osteoclast
activity, and are used clinically to treat bone-related conditions such as osteoporosis
and Paget's disease of bone; and cancer-related conditions including multiple
myeloma, and bone metastases from solid tumors. They generally have low oral
bioavailability.
        [0002]    Patchy osteoporosis and bone marrow edema may result from
osteoclast hyperactivity. Zoledronic acid is a potent inhibitor of bone resorption and
osteoclast activity. Nitrogen containing bisphosphonates, such as zoledronic acid,
also inhibit the mevalonate pathway in the osteoclast thereby interrupting normal
osteoclast function.
        [0003]    It has been discovered that oral dosage forms of bisphosphonate
compounds, such as zoledronic acid, can be used to treat or alleviate pain or related
conditions.
        [0004]    Some embodiments include a method of enhancing the oral
bioavailability of zoledronic acid comprising orally administering a dosage form
containing zoledronic acid in the disodium salt form.
        [0005]    Some embodiments include a dosage form comprising zoledronic
acid in the disodium salt form, wherein the bioavailability, in a mammal, of zoledronic
acid in the disodium salt form is greater than the bioavailability of zoledronic acid in
the diacid form would be in the same dosage form.
        [0006]    Some embodiments include a dosage form comprising zoledronic
acid, wherein the dosage form contains an amount of zoledronic acid in the disodium
salt form that provides an area under the plasma concentration curve of zoledronic
acid of about 4 ng-h/mL to about 2000 ng-h/mL to a human being to which the
dosage form is administered.
        [0007]    Some embodiments include a dosage form comprising zoledronic
acid in the disodium salt form, wherein the disodium salt form is present in a lower
molar amount than would be present if the zoledronic acid were in the diacid form;
                                             1

WO 2015/184003                                                       PCT/US2015/032739
and wherein the zoledronic acid in the disodium salt form has an improved
bioavailability as compared to the zoledronic acid in the diacid form to the extent that
the lower molar amount of the disodium salt in the dosage form does not reduce the
amount of zoledronic acid delivered to the plasma of a mammal.
        [0008]     Although an oral dosage form with enhanced bioavailability with
respect to the bisphosphonate compound can be used, the treatment can also be
effective using an oral dosage form that includes a bisphosphonate compound, such
as zoledronic acid, wherein the bioavailability of the bisphosphonate is unenhanced,
or is substantially unenhanced.
        [0009]     Some embodiments include a method of relieving inflammatory pain
comprising administering an oral dosage form containing zoledronic acid to a
mammal in need thereof, wherein the mammal experiences significant pain relief
more than 3 hours after administration of the dosage form.
        [0010]     Some embodiments include a method of relieving pain associated
with an arthritis comprising administering an oral dosage form containing zoledronic
acid to a human being in need thereof.
        [0011]     Some embodiments include a method of treating complex regional
pain syndrome comprising administering an oral dosage form containing zoledronic
acid to a mammal in need thereof.
        [0012]     Some embodiments include an oral dosage form comprising
zoledronic acid, wherein the oral bioavailability of zoledronic acid is substantially
unenhanced.      For example, in some embodiments, the oral bioavailability in the
dosage form is about 0.01 % to about 4%.
        [0013]     Some embodiments include a pharmaceutical product comprising
more than one unit of an oral dosage form described herein. In some embodiments,
each unit of the oral dosage form contains about 1 mg to about 50 mg of zoledronic
acid.
        [0014]     Some embodiments include a method of relieving inflammatory pain
comprising administering an oral dosage form containing zoledronic acid to a
mammal in need thereof.
        [0015]     In some embodiments, the mammal receives a total monthly dose
of zoledronic acid that is about 800 mg/m 2 or less.

zoledronic acid is administered per month, based upon the body surface area of the

         [0039]   The term "treating" or "treatment" broadly includes any kind of
treatment activity, including the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, or prevention of disease
in man or other animals, or any activity that otherwise affects the structure or any
function of the body of man or other animals.
         [0040]   An oral dosage form of a bisphosphonate such as zoledronic acid
may be used to treat, or provide relief of, any type of pain including, but not limited
to, inflammatory pain, arthritis pain, complex regional pain syndrome, lumbosacral
pain, musculoskeletal pain, neuropathic pain, chronic pain, cancer-related pain,
acute pain, postoperative pain, etc.   In some instances, pain relief may be palliative,
or pain relief may be provided independent of improvement of the disease or
condition or the underlying cause of the disease or condition. For example, although
the underlying disease may not improve, or may continue to progress, an individual
suffering from the disease may experience pain relief.           In some embodiments,
enhanced bioavailability of the zoledronic acid may be achieved in treating one of
these conditions by administering a dosage form comprising zoledronic acid in the
form of a disodium salt. This may allow a reduced molar amount of the disodium salt
to be used as compared to what would be used with the diacid form.

        [0042]    For example, zoledronic acid or another bisphosphonate may be
administered orally to relieve musculoskeletal pain including low back pain, and pain
associated with rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis,
erosive osteoarthritis, sero-negative (non-rheumatoid) arthropathies, non-articular
rheumatism, peri-articular disorders, axial spondyloarthritis including ankylosing
spondylitis, Paget's    disease,  fibrous dysplasia, SAPHO         syndrome,  transient
osteoarthritis of the hip, vertebral crush fractures, osteoporosis, etc.      In some
embodiments, enhanced bioavailability of the zoledronic acid may be achieved in
treating one of these conditions by administering a dosage form comprising
zoledronic acid in the form of a disodium salt. This may allow a reduced molar
amount of the disodium salt to be used as compared to what would be used with the
diacid form.
        [0043]    An osteoclast inhibitor, such as a bisphosphonate, e.g. zoledronic
acid, may also be used to treat bone fractures or to enhance the healing of bone
fractures.
        [0044]    In some embodiments, zoledronic acid or another bisphosphonate
may also be administered orally to relieve neuropathic pain, including diabetic
peripheral     neuropathy,      post-herpetic     neuralgia,   trigeminal    neuralgia,
monoradiculopathies, phantom limb pain, and central pain. Other causes of
neuropathic pain include cancer-related pain, lumbar nerve root compression, spinal
cord injury,   post-stroke pain, central     multiple sclerosis pain,   HIV-associated
neuropathy, and radio-therapy or chemo-therapy associated neuropathy.          In some
embodiments, enhanced bioavailability of the zoledronic acid may be achieved in
treating one of these conditions by administering a dosage form comprising
zoledronic acid in the form of a disodium salt. This may allow a reduced molar
amount of the disodium salt to be used as compared to what would be used with the

        [0046]      Examples of musculoskeletal pain include low back pain; and pain
associated with vertebral crush fractures, fibrous dysplasia, osteogenesis imperfecta,
Paget's disease of bone, transient osteoporosis, and transient osteoporosis of the
hip.
        [0047]     Arthritis refers to inflammatory joint diseases that can be associated
with pain. Examples of arthritis pain include pain associated with osteoarthritis,
erosive osteoarthritis, rheumatoid         arthritis, juvenile rheumatoid  arthritis, sero
negative (non-rheumatoid) arthropathies, non-articular rheumatism, peri-articular
disorders, neuropathic arthropathies including Charcot's foot, axial spondyloarthritis
including ankylosing spondylitis, and SAPHO syndrome.
        [0048]      In some embodiments, a human being that is treated for a disease
or condition, such as an inflammatory condition, e.g. arthritis, by an osteoclast
inhibitor, such as a bisphosphonate, e.g. an oral dosage form of zoledronic acid, has
an age of about 10 years to about 90 years, about 20 years to about 80 years, about
30 years to about 75 years old, about 40 years to about 70 years, about 1 year to
about 16 years, or about 80 years to about 95 years.

        [0051]     For treatment of arthritis or joint pain, such as knee pain, in some
embodiments the person being treated has OARSI Grade 0, or Kellgren and
Lawrence Grades 0 or 1, joint space narrowing.
        [0052]     In some embodiments, the person has lesions, such as bone
marrow lesions. In some embodiments the person being treated for bone marrow
lesions has normal joint space knee pain, OARSI Grade 0, or Kellgren and Lawrence
Grades 0 or 1, joint space narrowing.
        [0053]     In some embodiments, the person has baseline pain intensity of 5
or greater measured using the 0-10 numerical rating scale (NRS), or 50 mm or
greater using the 100 mm visual analog scale (VAS). In some embodiments the
person being treated for pain has normal joint space knee pain, OARSI Grade 0, or
Kellgren and Lawrence Grades 0 or 1, joint space narrowing.
        [0054]     Bone marrow lesions (BMLs) include regional bone marrow signal
intensity alterations on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). BMLs can be present in
the knee and can be an important feature of osteoarthritis of the knee. BMLs have
also been described in other rheumatic conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis,
osteonecrosis, ankylosing spondylitis, and transient osteoporosis of the hip and are
often referred to as bone marrow edema (BME).
        [0055]     In some embodiments, a person being treated for arthritis, such as
with zoledronic acid, has osteoarthritis of the knee associated with bone marrow
lesions.
        [0056]     In some embodiments, an inhibitor of osteoclast activity can be
used to treat bone marrow lesions.
        [0057]     In some embodiments, an inhibitor of osteoclast activity can be
used to treat bone marrow lesions of the knee, shoulder, ankle, wrist, hand, fingers,
spine, or hip.
        [0058]     Commonly used measures of pain intensity include the visual
analog scale (VAS) and the numerical rating scale (NRS). With the VAS approach,
patients rate the severity of their pain by marking a point on a 10-cm (or 100 mm)
VAS (0=no pain and 10=worst possible pain). With the NRS approach, patients rate
the severity of their pain by verbally responding to a 10-point NRS (0=no pain and
10=worst possible pain). VAS and NRS scores have been shown to be strongly

is equivalent to the same score on 10-point NRS (Bijur PE et al. Acad Emerg Med
2003; 10:390-392). For example, a VAS score of 5 cm (or 50 mm) is equivalent to an
NRS score of 5.      Knee pain in a person with a VAS score of 5 cm or 50 mm or
higher, or an NRS score of 5 or higher, may be referred to herein as moderate to
severe knee pain.
       [0059]     In   some    embodiments,      the   patient   suffering  from    pain,
inflammation, a similar condition, or any of the conditions described herein, has an
NRS of 5 or greater, or a VAS of 5 cm or greater. In some embodiments, the patient
has an NRS of 4 or greater, or a VAS of 4 cm or greater. In some embodiments, the
patient has an NRS of 6 or greater, or a VAS of 6 cm or greater. In some
embodiments, the patient has an NRS of 7 or greater, or a VAS of 7 cm or greater. In
some embodiments, the patient has an NRS of about 1, about 2, about 3, about 4,
about 5, about 6, about 7, about 8, about 9, or about 10. In some embodiments, the
patient has a VAS of about 1 cm, about 2 cm, about 3 cm, about 4 cm, about 5 cm,
about 6 cm, about 7 cm, about 8 cm, about 9 cm, or about 10 cm.
       [0060]     For knee pain or pain associated with bone marrow lesions, in
some embodiments, treatment with a nitrogen-containing bisphosphonate such as
zoledronic acid may decrease the visual analog (VAS) pain score measured using a
100 mm scale, by at least about 5 mm, at least about 8 mm, at least about 10 mm, at
least about 15 mm, up to about 50 mm, or up to about 100 mm.                    In some
embodiments, the VAS score, may be decreased by at least about 5 mm, at least
about 8 mm, at least about 10 mm, at least about 15 mm, up to about 50 mm, or up
to about 100 mm, as compared to a placebo.
       [0061]     Treatment with a nitrogen-containing bisphosphonate such as
zoledronic acid may decrease the numerical rating scale (NRS) pain score measured

       [0062]       In some embodiments, an inhibitor of osteoclast activity can be
used to reduce the size of bone marrow lesions. The area of the lesions may be
measured as the total area of all lesions or as the area of any one lesion. In some
embodiments, the total area includes the medial tibial area, the medial femoral area,
the lateral tibial area, and the lateral femoral area. In some embodiments the bone
marrow lesion in located in the patella.
       [0063]       In some embodiments, the use of an inhibitor of osteoclast activity
achieves a reduction in the total area of the bone marrow lesions of at least about
240 mm 2 . In some embodiments, the reduction in total area is at least about 220
mm2 , at least about 200 mm 2 , at least about 150 mm 2 , at least about 100 mm 2, or at
least about 50 mm 2 . In some embodiments, the reduction in size of bone marrow
lesions represents a reduction relative to baseline of at least about 10%, at least
about 20%, at least about 30%, at least about 40%, at least about 50%, at least
about 60%, at least about 70% at least about 80%, at least about 90%, or about

osteoclast activity inhibits an increase in the size of the bone marrow lesions over
time.
       [0064]       Joint space   narrowing    (JSN)  is typically graded    using the
Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI) atlas criteria, or the Kellgren
and Lawrence (K/L) system. The OARSI atlas criteria grades JSN using a 0-3 scale
with Grade 0 indicating an absence of JSN, and Grades 1, 2 and 3 indicating mild,
moderate, and severe JSN, respectively (Altman and Gold, Osteoarthritis Cartilage
2007;15(Suppl A):A1-A56). The K/L system grades JSN using a 0-4 scale with
Grade 0 indicating an absence of JSN, Grade 1 indicating doubtful JSN, and grades
2, 3 and 4 indicating minimal, moderate, and severe JSN, respectively (Kellgren and
Lawrence , Ann Rheum Dis 1957;16:494-502). Based on these criteria, OARSI
Grade 0 (absence of JSN), approximates K/L Grades 0-1 (absence of, or doubtful

osteoclast inhibitor such as zoledronic acid.
        [0079]     With respect to the treatment of any condition recited herein, in
some embodiments a first oral dosage form comprising zoledronic acid is
administered and a second oral dosage form comprising oral zoledronic acid is
administered. The timing of the administration of the two dosage forms may be such
that, with respect to the first oral dosage form, the second oral dosage with respect
to the first oral dosage form, the second oral dosage form is administered at 5 x Tmax
or greater (e.g., if Tmax is 1 hour, at 5 hours or later), at least 10 x Tmax or greater, at
least about 15 x Tmax or greater, at least about 20 x Tmax or greater, at least about 50
x Tmax  or greater, or at least about 200 x Tmax or greater, wherein Tmax is the time of
maximum plasma concentration for the first oral dosage
        [0080]     Some embodiments include treatment of a condition recited herein,
such as inflammatory pain, arthritis, or complex regional pain syndrome, wherein the
treatment comprises either: administering only one dosage form to a mammal to
treat the condition, or administering a first dosage form to the mammal, followed by
administering a second dosage form to the mammal. If two or more dosage forms
are administered, the second oral dosage form is administered before the maximum
pain relieving effect of the first oral dosage form is achieved, or before a peak in the
pain relieving effect of the first oral dosage form is experienced by a mammal,
receiving the dosage form. In some embodiments, the second oral dosage form is
administered before an observable pain relieving effect is achieved.               In some
embodiments, the second dosage form is administered about 12 hours to about 60
days, about 24 hours to about 28 days, about 24 hours to about 7 days, about 24
hours to about 14 days, or about 24 hours to about 21 days, after the first dosage
form is administered.

form is administered after the maximum pain relieving effect of the first oral dosage
form is achieved, and the second oral dosage form is administered while the
mammal is still experiencing pain relief from the first oral dosage form, or while the

        [0082]    Zoledronic    acid    or    another    bisphosphonate     may    also   be
administered orally to relieve cancer-related pain, including pain associated with
multiple myeloma and bone metastases from solid tumors. In some embodiments,
zoledronic acid is used to treat pain that is not cancer-related pain.        For example,
zoledronic acid may be used to treat pain that is not associated with multiple
myeloma, bone metastasis from solid tumors, hypercalcemia of malignancy, giant
cell tumor of bone, blood cancers or leukemias, or solid tumors or cancers. In some
embodiments, enhanced bioavailability of the zoledronic acid may be achieved in
treating one of these conditions by administering a dosage form comprising
zoledronic acid in the form of a disodium salt. This may allow a reduced molar
amount of the disodium salt to be used as compared to what would be used with the
diacid form.
        [0083]    In addition to relieving pain, oral administration of zoledronic acid or
another bisphosphonate may also be useful to treat diseases or conditions that may
or may not include a pain component.            For example, zoledronic acid or another
bisphosphonate may be useful to treat any of the pain conditions or types of
conditions listed above, including treatment that does not simply relieve the pain of
those conditions, and treatment that is carried out in such a way that the condition is
treated without pain relief occurring.     In addition to any pain relief zoledronic acid or
another bisphosphonate may or may not provide, zoledronic acid or another
bisphosphonate may be used to treat a disease or condition such as a metabolic
disease    or  condition;   an   inflammatory      disease   or  condition,   including   an
inflammatory disease or condition that is not associated with pain; a cancer disease
or condition; a neurological disease or condition; etc.           In some embodiments,
enhanced bioavailability of the zoledronic acid may be achieved in treating one of
these conditions by administering a dosage form comprising zoledronic acid in the
form of a disodium salt. This may allow a reduced molar amount of the disodium salt
to be used as compared to what would be used with the diacid form.

        [0084]     In some embodiments, oral administration of zoledronic acid or
another bisphosphonate may also be useful to treat complex regional pain
syndrome,      rheumatoid    arthritis,   osteoarthritis,   erosive   osteoarthritis,    axial
spondyloarthritis including ankylosing spondylitis, acute vertebral crush fracture,
fibrous dysplasia, SAPHO syndrome, osteoporosis, transient osteoporosis, or

       [0089]      Unless otherwise indicated, when             a compound or chemical
structural feature such as heterocyclyl alkyl is referred to as being "optionally
substituted," it includes a feature that has no substituents (i.e. unsubstituted), or a
feature that is substituted, meaning that the feature has one or more substituents.
The term "substituent" has the broadest meaning known to one of ordinary skill in the
art, and includes a moiety that replaces one or more hydrogen atoms in a parent
compound or structural feature.          The term "replaces" is merely used herein for
convenience, and does not require that the compound be formed by replacing one
atom with another.       In some embodiments, a substituent may be any ordinary
organic moiety known in the art, which may have a molecular weight (e.g. the sum of
the atomic masses of the atoms of the substituent) of 15 g/mol to 50 g/mol, 15 g/mol
to 100 g/mol, 15 g/mol to 150 g/mol,15 g/mol to 200 g/mol, 15 g/mol to 300 g/mol, or
 15 g/mol to 500 g/mol. In some embodiments, a substituent comprises, or consists
of: 0-30, 0-20, 0-10, or 0-5 carbon atoms; and 0-30, 0-20, 0-10, or 0-5 heteroatoms,
wherein each heteroatom may independently be: N, 0, P, S, Si, F, Cl, Br, or I;
provided that the substituent includes one C, N, 0, P, S, Si, F, Cl, Br, or I atom. In
some embodiments, substituents can independently have a molecular weight of
about 15 Da to about 600 Da and can consist of 2 to 5 chemical elements, wherein
the chemical elements are independently C, H, 0, N, P, S, Si, F, Cl, or Br. In some
embodiments, a substituent is optionally substituted alkyl, -0-alkyl (e.g. -OCH                   3,
OC 2H5, -OC 3 H7 , -OC 4 H9 , etc.), -S-alkyl (e.g. -SCH 3 , -SC 2 H5 , -SC 3 H7 , -SC 4 H9 , etc.),
NR'R", -OH,      -SH, -CN, -CF 3 , -NO 2 , perfluoroalkyl, optionally substituted aryl,
optionally substituted heteroaryl, optionally substituted amine or a halogen, wherein
R' and R" are independently H or optionally substituted alkyl.                       Wherever a
substituent is described as "optionally substituted," that substituent can                         be
substituted with the above substituents.
       [0090]      For convenience, the term "molecular weight" is used with respect
to a moiety or part of a molecule to indicate the sum of the atomic masses of the
atoms in the moiety or part of a molecule, even though it may not be a complete
molecule.

         [0093]     Unless otherwise indicated, any reference to a compound herein,

species that may rapidly convert to a compound described herein under conditions in
which the compounds are used as described herein.
         [0094]     In some embodiments, zoledronic acid is administered in a dosage
form comprising a salt form, such as a salt of a dianion of zoledronic acid. In some
embodiments, zoledronic acid is administered in a dosage form comprising a
disodium salt form of zoledronic acid.      In some embodiments, zoledronic acid is
administered in a sodium salt form, such as a monosodium salt, a disodium salt, a
trisodium salt, etc.      In some circumstances, use of the disodium salt may be
desirable. For example, the disodium salt is much more soluble in water than the
diacid form. As a result, in some processes, the disodium salt can be easier to work
with than the diacid form. Additionally, the sodium salt may be more bioavailable
and/or more rapidly absorbed when taken orally as compared to the diacid form.

changes, or vertebral endplate signal changes (VESC) and bone marrow changes
visible using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or neck pain or back pain
associated with Modic changes.
       [0107]    Modic changes, as used herein, includes its ordinary meaning in the
art and refers to pathological vertebral endplate and bone marrow changes visible
using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).        Modic changes may also be referred to
as vertebral endplate signal changes (VESC). Modic changes, can be classified into
various types including type 1 (MI), type 2 (M2), and type 3 (M3) lesions or changes,
any of which may be treated using an osteoclast inhibitor, such as a nitrogen
bisphosphonate, including, e.g. zoledronic acid, minodronic acid, etc. Different types
of Modic changes may occur in the same patient, for example type 1 and type 2
Modic changes (M1/2). In some cases, M1 changes are related to lower back pain
than other types of Modic change.

       [0121]      The oral bioavailability of zoledronic acid may be enhanced by
orally administering the zoledronic acid in the disodium salt form. For example, the
bioavailability of zoledronic acid may be improved by at least about 10%, at least
about 20%, at least about 30%, at least about 50%, and/or up to about 100%, or up
to about 200%, as compared to administration of zoledronic acid in the diacid form.
       [0122]      Because of the improved bioavailability of the disodium salt a
dosage form may contain, or a mammal, such as a human being, may receive, on a
molar basis, less of the disodium salt form of zoledronic acid than would otherwise
be administered of the diacid form of zoledronic acid. For example, a dosage form
may contain, or a mammal may receive, at least about 10 mole% less, at least about
20 mole% less, at least about 40 mole% less, at least about 50 mole% less, and/or
up to about 90 mole% less or 95 mole% less, of the disodium salt form as compared
the amount of the diacid form of zoledronic acid that would otherwise be
administered, such as a molar amount that would be administered of zoledronic acid
in the diacid form in order to achieve the same plasma levels of zoledronic acid.
       [0123]      In some embodiments, a dosage form contains, or a mammal (such
as a human being) is administered, an amount of the disodium salt form, on a molar
basis, that has a value of about 0. 8 nd to about 1.2 nd or about 0. 9 nd to about 1.1nd,
wherein:
                                     nd = (ba/bd)(na)
wherein ba is the bioavailability of the diacid form, bd is the bioavailability of the
disodium salt form, and na is the number of moles of the diacid that would be
administered in a dosage form containing the diacid form of zoledronic acid. For
example, if the diacid form has a bioavailability (ba) of 0.01 and the disodium salt
form has a bioavailabity (bd) of 0.015, and a dosage form would normally contain
0.001 moles of the diacid, nd would be (0.01/0.015)(0.001 moles), or about 0.00067

moles. In some embodiments, the disodium salt is administered in an amount that
has a value of about nd.
       [0124]      With respect to oral dosage forms comprising a reduced molar
amount of the disodium salt of zoledronic acid as compared to the diacid form of
zoledronic acid, in some embodiments, the bioavailability of the zoledronic acid in
the disodium salt form is sufficiently high that, if the drug is administered to a
mammal, at least as much zoledronic acid is present in the blood of the mammal as
would be present if zoledronic acid were administered in the diacid form.
       [0125]      With respect to oral dosage forms comprising the disodium salt
form of zoledronic acid, in some embodiments, the disodium salt form is present in a
lower molar amount than would be present if the zoledronic acid were in the diacid
form; and the zoledronic acid in the disodium salt form has an improved
bioavailability as compared to the zoledronic acid in the diacid form to the extent that
the lower molar amount of the disodium salt in the dosage form does not reduce the
amount of zoledronic acid delivered to the plasma of a mammal.
       [0126]      Some oral dosage forms comprising zoledronic acid have a dose of
zoledronic acid and a configuration suitable for a particular species of mammal, e.g.
dog, rat, human, etc. Such a dosage form may have zoledronic acid present in an
amount that results in a desired range for an area under the plasma concentration
curve (AUC) of zoledronic acid in that particular species of mammal.       For example
the dose of zoledronic acid and a configuration of the oral dosage form may result in
an AUC of zoledronic acid of about 1 ng-hr/mL to about 700 ng-hr/mL, about 3

200 ng-h/mL to about 300 ng-h/mL, in the mammal to which the dosage form is
administered.   This amount may be suitable for weekly administration of the oral
dosage, or for administration of 3 to 5 individual dosages during a month.         The
individual dosages could be given at regular intervals, given during the first week, or
at any other schedule that provides 3 to 5 dosages during the month.
        [0133]   In some embodiments, the zoledronic acid is present in an amount
such that the oral dosage form provides an area under the plasma concentration
curve of zoledronic acid of about 4 ng-h/mL to about 100 ng-h/mL, about 10 ng-h/mL

200 ng-h/mL, or about 200 ng-h/mL to about 300 ng-h/mL in the mammal to which
the dosage form is administered.         This amount may be suitable for daily
administration of the oral dosage form.      In some embodiments, the dosage form
may be administered for 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10, 5 to 10, or 6 to 10 consecutive
days.
        [0134]   Oral    administration   of    zoledronic   acid,   particularly  oral
administration of the disodium salt form of zoledronic acid, can result in more

sustained plasma levels of the drug as compared to parenteral modes of
administration, such intravenous or subcutaneous.          For example, the amount of
zoledronic acid in the plasma can be significantly higher for oral administration of the
disodium salt about 24 hours or 48 hours, or longer, after administration. In some
embodiments, oral zoledronic acid has a 24 hour sustained plasma level factor of
about 1 or higher, such as about 1 to about 10, about 1 to about 5, about 3 to about
5, or about 3 to about 4. In some embodiments, an orally administered dosage form
of zoledronic acid has a 24 hour sustained plasma level factor or a 48 hour sustained
plasma level factor that is higher, such as at least 1.2 times, at least about 2 times,
at least about 5 times, about 1.2 times to about 20 times, about 2 times to about 15
times, about 5 times to about 10 times, or about 8 to about 15 times that of
intravenously administered zoledronic acid. A "sustained plasma level factor," pf, is
determined by the equation:
       pf = 1000 (Ct/Cmax)
wherein Cmax is the maximum plasma concentration of zoledronic acid after it is
administered and Ct is the plasma concentration of zoledronic acid at the time of
interest, such as 24 hours. For parenteral administration, the Cmax can be about the
Co, or the concentration right after injection of the entire amount of the drug into the
body. Sustained plasma level factors can also be obtained for other times, such as
48 hours, by using the plasma concentration of zoledronic acid for Ci in the equation
above.     For example, if the maximum plasma level of zoledronic acid after
administration is 1000 ng/mL and the plasma level of zoledronic acid at 24 hours is 1
ng/mL, the 24 hour sustained plasma level factor is 1.

       [0146]     As used herein, the "elimination half-life" refers to the apparent first
order terminal plasma elimination half-life, obtained by non-compartmental analysis
using Win-Nonlin.     A terminal plasma elimination half-life is the time required to
reduce the plasma concentration to half after reaching pseudo-equilibrium, and not
the time required to eliminate half the administered dose.        For orally administered
drugs, terminal plasma elimination half-life can be affected by absorption of the drug,
as well as plasma clearance and extent of distribution.
       [0147]     In some embodiments, the disodium salt form of zoledronic acid
provides an enhancement to bioavailability, as compared to the diacid form of
zoledronic acid, which adds to any enhancement to bioavailability provided by any
bioavailability-enhancing agents in the dosage form.        In some embodiments, the
disodium salt form of zoledronic acid provides an enhancement to bioavailability, as
compared to the diacid form of zoledronic acid, which is greater than any
enhancement to bioavailability provided by any bioavailability-enhancing agents in
the dosage form. In some embodiments, the disodium salt form of zoledronic acid
may be administered in a dosage form that is substantially free of bioavailability
enhancing agents.
       [0148]     In some embodiments, a dosage form comprising a disodium salt of
zoledronic acid is a solid.
       [0149]     In some embodiments, a dosage form comprising a disodium salt of

        [0151]     In some embodiments, a dosage form comprising a disodium salt of
zoledronic acid is used to treat complex regional pain syndrome.
        [0152]     In some embodiments, zoledronic acid is in a form that has an
aqueous solubility, meaning the solubility in water, greater than 1% (w/v), about 5%
(w/v) to about 50% (w/v), about 5% (w/v) to about 20% (w/v), about 10% (w/v) to
about 15% (w/v), or about 12% (w/v) to about 13% (w/v).
        [0153]     The    disodium   salt form     of zoledronic   acid   can  be   more
compressible than the diacid form of zoledronic acid. This can make it easier for a
dosage form to have a desired hardness. It can also make it easier to increase the
drug load, so that a smaller tablet can be given for a given dosage strength. In some
embodiments, a solid dosage form of zoledronic acid, such as the diacid form of
zoledronic acid or the disodium salt form of zoledronic acid, can have a hardness of
about 5 kPa to about 20 kPa or about 5 kPa to about 14 kPa.
        [0154]     Zoledronic acid or another bisphosphonate may be combined with a
pharmaceutical carrier selected on the basis of the chosen route of administration
and standard pharmaceutical practice as described, for example, in Remington's
Pharmaceutical Sciences, 2005, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated
herein by reference, in its entirety. The relative proportions of active ingredient and
carrier may be determined, for example, by the solubility and chemical nature of the
compounds, chosen route of administration and standard pharmaceutical practice.
        [0155]     Zoledronic acid or another bisphosphonate may be administered by
any means that may result in the contact of the active agent(s) with the desired site
or site(s) of action in the body of a patient. The compounds may be administered by
any conventional means available for use in conjunction with pharmaceuticals, either
as individual therapeutic agents or in a combination of therapeutic agents. For
example, they may be administered as the sole active agents in a pharmaceutical
composition, or they can be used in combination with other therapeutically active
ingredients.
        [0156]     In some embodiments, an osteoclast inhibitor is co-administered
with a steroid. Suitable steroids include, for example, hydrocortisone, hydrocortisone

        [0157]     Any effective dose of steroid can be administered to a person. In
some embodiment, the dose of steroids may be about 1 to about 500 mg of the
steroid. In some embodiments, the dose of steroids does not exceed the 25 mg of
the steroid, and is not less than 5 mg of the steroid.
        [0158]     The steroid can be given orally (for example, 7.5 mg of prednisone),
by a separate infusion (for example, 7.5 mg of methyl prednisolone), mixed in with
zoledronic acid     in the same        infusion, or be administered          intramuscularly,
subcutaneously, by rectal suppository, by inhalation, or injected directly into a joint.
        [0159]     Zoledronic acid or another bisphosphonate may be administered to
a human patient in a variety of forms adapted to the chosen route of administration,
e.g., orally, rectally, or parenterally.       Parenteral administration in this respect
includes, but is not limited to, administration by the following routes: pulmonary,
intrathecal, intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous, intraocular, intrasynovial,
transepithelial including transdermal,        sublingual and       buccal; topically;  nasal
inhalation via insufflation; and rectal systemic.
        [0160]     The effective amount of zoledronic acid or another bisphosphonate
will vary depending on various factors known to the treating physicians, such as the
severity of the condition to be treated, route of administration, formulation and
dosage forms, physical characteristics of the bisphosphonate compound used, and
age, weight and response of the individual patients.
        [0161]     The amount of zoledronic acid or another bisphosphonate in a
therapeutic composition may vary.          For example, some liquid compositions may

        [0178]     With respect to oral administration of an osteoclast inhibitor, such
as zoledronic acid, minodronic acid, ibandronic acid, or another bisphosphonate, for
the treatment of pain associated with inflammation, arthritis, CRPS, or any other
condition recited herein, it may helpful if the mammal or human being to which the
osteoclast inhibitor is administered does not eat food or drink beverage, (other than
any water required to swallow the oral dosage form) for at least about 1 hour, at least
about 2 hours, at least about 4 hours, at least about 6 hours, at least about 8 hours,
at least about 10 hours, or at least about 12 hours before the osteoclast inhibitor is
administered.    It may also be helpful if the mammal or human being to which the
osteoclast inhibitor is administered does not eat food or drink beverage for at least
about 30 minutes, at least about 1 hour, at least about 2 hours, at least about 3
hours, or at least about 4 hours after the osteoclast inhibitor is administered.         In
some embodiments, a human being to which the zoledronic acid is administered
avoids lying down, or remains upright or sits upright, for at least about 30 minutes or
about 1 hour after receiving a dosage form containing the osteoclast inhibitor.
Avoiding food or beverage before or after oral administration of the osteoclast
inhibitor can improve the bioavailability of the osteoclast inhibitor.
        [0179]     The oral bioavailability of osteoclast inhibitor in a dosage form can
vary.     Some dosage forms may have ingredients added to enhance the
bioavailability.  However, bioavailability enhancement is not necessary for an oral
dosage form to be effective. In some embodiments, the dosage form is substantially
free of bioavailability-enhancing agents. In some embodiments, an oral dosage form
may have an oral bioavailability of the osteoclast inhibitor-such as zoledronic acid,
minodronic acid, ibandronic acid-of about 0.01% to about 10%, about 0.1% to
about 7%, about 0.1% to about 5%, etc. Without ingredients or other methods to
enhance bioavailability, bisphosphonates such as zoledronic acid typically have a
low bioavailability in an oral dosage form.           In some embodiments, the oral

conditions, or the amount per dose may be increased or decreased as treatment
progresses. The chosen dose may be administered one or more times per week,
monthly, every two months, every three months, every six months, or every year.
       [0210]     In some embodiments, 60 mg of denosumab is administered
subcutaneously to patient in need of treatment. In some embodiments, the
administration is repeated every six months.
       [0211]     There are a number of ways that some part of Compound 1 and/or
Compound 2 may be removed from a zoledronic acid product. For example, HPLC,
preparative TLC, crystallization, sublimation, or zone purification may be employed.
Solvents that may be useful in HPLC, TLC, or crystallization, may include, but are
not limited to, water or organic solvents, such as hexanes, diethyl ether, ethyl
acetate, methyl acetate, acetone, acetic acid, acetonitrile, tetrahydrofuran, ethanol,
methanol, isopropyl alcohol, chloroform, diethyl ether, toluene, dimethylformamide,
benzene, etc. Gradients, or two solvent systems may be employed as well. For
example, an HPLC separation may begin by elution with water, after some time
eluting with water, an organic solvent, such as acetonitrile, methanol, ethanol, ethyl
acetate, acetone, acetic acid, methyl acetate, or another solvent could gradually be
added to the water, or may replace the water entirely. Similarly, crystallization or
recrystallization may employ a single solvent, or a combination of solvents.       For
example, zoledronic acid or a salt thereof, such as a disodium salt, might be
recrystallized from water, ethanol, methanol, diethyl ether, methyl acetate, acetic
acid, etc., or a combination of these solvents or others.      In some embodiments,
zoledronic acid or a salt thereof, such as a disodium salt, may be dissolved in one

Effect of Orally Administered Zoledronic Acid in Rat Model of Inflammatory
Pain

 WO 2015/184003                                                          PCT/US2015/032739
Method:
         [0214]     The effect of orally administered zoledronic acid on inflammatory
pain was examined using the rat complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) model.
 Inflammatory pain was induced by injection of 100% CFA in a 75 pL volume into the
left hind paws of Sprague-Dawley rats on day 0, followed by assessments on days 1
                                                                                    2
3. Animals were orally administered vehicle (control), zoledronic acid 18 mg/m        (or 3
                                        2                                             2
mg/kg), zoledronic acid 120 mg/m          (or 20 mg/kg), or zoledronic acid 900 mg/m    (or
 150 mg/kg) daily on days 1-3. Drug was dissolved in distilled water and prepared
fresh daily. Animals were fasted prior to dosing.        Under current FDA guidelines for
extrapolating starting dosages from animals to humans, dosages expressed in
       2
mg/m      are considered equivalent between mammalian species. Thus, for example,
            2
 18 mg/m      in a rat is considered equivalent to 18 mg/m 2 in a human being, while 3
mg/kg in a rat may not be equivalent to 3 mg/kg in a human being.
         [0215]     Values for inflammatory pain (mechanical hyperalgesia) in the
vehicle and drug-treated animals were obtained on day 0 prior to CFA injection, and
at baseline and post-treatment on days 1-3. Pain was assessed using a digital
Randall-Selitto device (dRS; IITC Life Sciences, Woodland Hills, CA). Animals were
placed in a restraint sling that suspended the animal, leaving the hind limbs available
for testing. Paw compression threshold was measured by applying increasing
pressure to the plantar surface of the hind paw with a dome-shaped tip placed
between the 3rd and 4th metatarsus.                Pressure was applied gradually over
approximately 10 seconds. Measurements were taken from the first observed
nocifensive behavior of vocalization, struggle or withdrawal. A cut-off value of 300 g
was used to prevent injury to the animal.
         [0216]      Reversal of inflammatory pain was calculated according to the
formula:
% reversal = ( Post-treatment - Post-CFA baseline)/(Pre-CFA baseline -                Post
CFA baseline) x 100.
         [0217]     The experiment was carried out using 9-10 animals per group.
Results:
         [0218]     Oral    administration    of zoledronic acid   significantly improved
inflammatory pain thresholds compared to vehicle.           Pain threshold measurements

taken at various times are shown in FIG. 1. Paw compression thresholds in the 18
mg/m 2 group were higher than for vehicle during the entire measurement period after
30 minutes from the start of treatment. On day three, paw compression thresholds
                          2                2
for both the 18 mg/m        and 900 mg/m      groups were greater than for vehicle. An
improvement in pain threshold of 49% and 83% from baseline was observed for the
           2
 18 mg/m     and the 900 mg/m 2 groups respectively.
         [0219]    Orally administered zoledronic acid produced a 29% reversal of
inflammatory pain at the 18 mg/m 2 , and a 48% reversal at the 900 mg/m       2
                                                                                 dose. This
magnitude      of effect is comparable to that obtained         with clinical     doses of
commercially available NSAIDs when tested in a similar model of inflammatory pain.
Under current FDA guidelines, the reference body surface area of a human adult is
                                              2
 1.62 M 2 . Thus, a daily dose of 18 mg/m       corresponds to a monthly dose of about
500-560 mg/m 2 or a human dose of about 800-900 mg.
         [0220]    Surprisingly, the two higher doses resulted in thresholds that were
                                                                            2
lower than vehicle on the first two days of dosing. The 120 mg/m                group was
approximately equal or inferior to vehicle at all time points during the assessment
                                2
period. While the 900 mg/m        group showed effectiveness on day 3, this result was
accompanied by significant toxicity necessitating euthanization of all the animals in
this group two days after cessation of dosing.
Example 2
Effect of Orally Administered Zoledronic Acid in Rat Model of Arthritis Pain
Method:
         [0221]    The effect of orally administered zoledronic acid on arthritis pain
was examined in the rat complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) model of arthritis pain. In
this model, injection of 100% complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) in a 75 pL volume
into the left hind paws is followed by a 10-14 day period to allow for the development
of arthritis pain. Animals were orally administered vehicle (control), zoledronic acid
           2                                            2
54 mg/m      (or 9 mg/kg), or zoledronic acid 360 mg/m    (or 60 mg/kg), divided in three
equal daily doses on the first three days post CFA injection. Drug was dissolved in
distilled water and prepared fresh daily. Animals were fasted prior to dosing.
         [0222]    Arthritis pain (mechanical hyperalgesia) in the vehicle and drug
treated animals was evaluated on day 14 post CFA injection using a digital Randall

to the plantar surface of the hind paw with a dome-shaped tip placed between the
3rd and 4th metatarsus. Pressure was applied gradually over approximately 10
seconds. Measurements were taken from the first observed nocifensive behavior of
vocalization, struggle or withdrawal. A cut-off value of 300 g was used to prevent
injury to the animal.
        [0223]     Reversal of arthritis pain in the ipsilateral (CFA-injected) paw was
calculated according to the formula:
        %    reversal     =    (ipsilateral   drug  threshold      -     ipsilateral  vehicle
threshold)/(contralateral vehicle threshold - ipsilateral vehicle threshold) x 100.
        [0224]     The experiment was carried out using 7-10 animals per group.
Results:
        [0225]     Oral administration of zoledronic acid significantly improved arthritis
pain thresholds compared to vehicle.            As shown in FIGS. 2A and 2B, orally
administered zoledronic acid produced a dose-dependent reversal of arthritis pain. A
                                                      2
reversal of 33% was observed in the 54 mg/m             group, and reversal of 54% was
                              2
observed in the 360 mg/m         group.     Under current FDA guidelines, the reference
                                                                     2
body surface area of a human adult is 1.62 M 2 . Thus, 54 mg/m         in a rat is equivalent
to an implied human dose of about 87 mg, and 360 mg/m 2 in a rat is equivalent to an
implied human dose of about 583 mg.
Example 3. Treatment of Complex Regional Pain Syndrome with Orally
Administered Zoledronic Acid.
        [0226]     The effect of orally administered zoledronic acid was examined in
the rat tibia fracture model of complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS). CRPS was
induced in the rats by fracturing the right distal tibias of the animals and casting the
fractured hindpaws for 4 weeks, as described in Guo TZ et al. (Pain. 2004;108:95
 107). This animal model has been shown to replicate the inciting trauma, natural
history, signs, symptoms, and pathologic changes observed in human CRPS
patients (Kingery WS et al., Pain. 2003;104:75-84).

        [0227]   Animals were       orally administered  either vehicle (control)   or
zoledronic acid, in a dosage of 18 mg/m 2/day (3 mg/kg/day) for 28 days, starting on
the day of fracture and casting. Drug was dissolved in distilled water and
administered by gavage. Animals were fasted for 4 hours before and 2 hours after
dosing. At the end of the 28-day period, casts were removed, and on the following
day, the rats were tested for hindpaw pain, edema, and warmth.
Pain assessments
        [0228]    Pain was assessed by measuring hyperalgesia, and weight bearing.
        [0229]   To measure hyperalgesia, an up-down von Frey testing paradigm
was used. Rats were placed in a clear plastic cylinder (20 cm in diameter) with a wire
mesh bottom and allowed to acclimate for 15 minutes. The paw was tested with one
of a series of eight von Frey hairs ranging in stiffness from 0.41 g to 15.14 g. The
von Frey hair was applied against the hindpaw plantar skin at approximately midsole,
taking care to avoid the tori pads. The fiber was pushed until it slightly bowed and
then it was jiggled in that position for 6 seconds. Stimuli were presented at an
interval of several seconds. Hindpaw withdrawal from the fiber was considered a
positive response. The initial fiber presentation was 2.1 g and the fibers were
presented according to the up-down method of Dixon to generate six responses in
the immediate vicinity of the 50% threshold. Stimuli were presented at an interval of
several seconds.
        [0230]   An incapacitance device (IITC Inc. Life Science, Woodland, CA,
USA) was used to measure hindpaw weight bearing, a postural effect of pain. The
rats were manually held in a vertical position over the apparatus with the hindpaws
resting on separate metal scale plates and the entire weight of the rat was supported
on the hindpaws. The duration of each measurement was 6 seconds and 10
consecutive measurements were taken at 60-second intervals. Eight readings
(excluding the highest and lowest ones) were averaged to calculate the bilateral
hindpaw weight-bearing values.       Weight bearing data were analyzed as the ratio
between right (fracture) and left hindpaw weight bearing values ((2R/(R+L)) x100%).
Edema assessment
        [0231]   A laser sensor technique was used to determine the dorsal-ventral
thickness of the hindpaw. Before baseline testing the bilateral hindpaws were
                                           59

tattooed with a 2 to 3 mm spot on the dorsal skin over the midpoint of the third
metatarsal. For laser measurements each rat was briefly anesthetized with isoflurane
and then held vertically so the hindpaw rested on a table top below the laser. The
paw was gently held flat on the table with a small metal rod applied to the top of the
ankle joint. Using optical triangulation, a laser with a distance measuring sensor was
used to determine the distance to the table top and to the top of the hindpaw at the
tattoo site and the difference was used to calculate the dorsal-ventral paw thickness.
The measurement sensor device used in these experiments (4381 Precicura, Limab,
Goteborg, Sweden) has a measurement range of 200 mm with a 0.01 mm resolution.
Hindpaw temperature measurement
        [0232]    The temperature of the hindpaw was measured using a fine wire
thermocouple (Omega, Stanford, CT, USA) applied to the paw skin. Six sites were
tested per hindpaw. The six measurements for each hindpaw were averaged for the
mean temperature.
Results
        [0233]    As    illustrated in  FIG.    3, treatment with    orally administered
zoledronic acid reversed pain, restored weight bearing, and prevented edema as
compared to vehicle treated animals.
        [0234]    As illustrated in FIG. 4, von Frey pain thresholds for the right
(fracture) hindpaw were reduced by 72% versus the contralateral (normal) hindpaw
in vehicle treated animals. Zoledronate treatment reversed fracture induced pain by
77% as compared to vehicle treatment.
        [0235]    As illustrated in FIG. 5, reduction in weight bearing, a postural effect
of pain, was significantly higher in the vehicle treated group as compared to the
zoledronic acid treated group. Weight bearing on the fracture hindlimb was reduced
to 55% of normal in the vehicle treated group. Zoledronate treatment significantly
restored hindlimb weight bearing as compared to vehicle treatment (86% of normal).
        [0236]    As illustrated in FIG. 6, the expected increase in hindpaw thickness
was greater in the vehicle treated group as compared to the zoledronic acid treated
group, reflecting the development of edema. Zoledronate treatment reduced hindpaw
edema by 60% versus vehicle treatment.

WO 2015/184003                                                      PCT/US2015/032739
        [0237]    Zoledronic acid reduced hindpaw warmth by 5% versus vehicle
treatment.
        [0238]    The daily dose in the above experiment was 18 mg/m 2/day. Under
current FDA guidelines, the reference body surface area of a human adult is 1.62
m2 . Thus, a daily dose of 18 mg/m 2 corresponds to a monthly dose of about 500-560
mg/m 2 or a human dose of about 800-900 mg.
Example 6. Solubility of Disodium Salt of Zoledronic Acid
        [0239]    The aqueous solubility of zoledronic acid and disodium zoledronate
tetrahydrate was determined. One gram of the test compound was measured in to a
beaker. Demineralized water (pH 5.5) was then added in small increments to the test
compound, and sonification was applied to the mixture. The procedure was
continued until complete dissolution was achieved. Full dissolution was determined
to have been reached when a clear solution was present with no visible material.
The volume of water required to reach full dissolution was used to calculate a
solubility value expressed in grams per 100 mL. The procedure was performed for
each compound.
Results
        [0240]    As shown in FIG. 7, the aqueous solubility of disodium zoledronate
tetrahydrate is approximately 50 times that of zoledronic acid. Disodium zoledronate
tetrahydrate has a solubility of 12.5 g/100 mL compared to only 0.25 g/100 mL for
zoledronic acid.
Example 7. Bioavailability of Orally Administered Zoledronic Acid and
Disodium Zoledronate
        [0241]    Tablets were manufactured containing either pure zoledronic acid
or the disodium salt of zoledronic acid (disodium zoledronate tetrahydrate). Both
types of tablets contained 50 mg of zoledronic acid equivalent per tablet. Identical
excipients were used in both types of tablets, with amounts adjusted to account for
the difference in molecular weights between the acid and the disodium salt.
        [0242]    Beagle dogs were orally administered tablets containing 150 mg
zoledronic acid equivalent either in the form of disodium zoledronate (Group 1) or
pure zoledronic acid (Group 2). Each animal was given three 50 mg equivalent

tablets (150 mg total), which were administered together. The animal's oral cavity
was wetted with water before placing the tablets on the back of the animal's tongue.
Animals were fasted before and after dosing. Animals were 6 to 9 months of age and
weighed 6 to 10 kg on the day of dosing. There were three dogs per group.
       [0243]    Serial  blood samples were collected from each animal             by
venipuncture of the jugular vein at various points after dosing for measurement of
plasma concentrations of zoledronic acid. Blood samples were collected into chilled
tubes containing K2 EDTA as the anticoagulant. Samples were then centrifuged at
approximately 3000 rpm at +40C for 10 minutes for plasma derivation. Plasma
concentrations of zoledronic acid were measured using an LC/MS/MS method.
Results
       [0244]    The average plasma concentrations of zoledronic acid for each
group of dogs is summarized in Table 1 and illustrated in FIG. 8. Detectable plasma
levels of zoledronic acid were observed for the entire 48 hours that they were
measured.

        [0245]    Disodium zoledronate produced significantly higher plasma levels of
zoledronic acid than pure zoledronic acid, indicating improved oral absorption with
the salt form. Measured using peak plasma concentrations (Cmax), the disodium salt
resulted in a 119% actual and 74% weight-adjusted increase in bioavailability as
compared to pure zoledronic acid. Measured using area under the plasma
concentration curve (AUCo..), bioavailability was 84% and 46% greater with the
disodium salt than with pure zoledronic acid, on an actual and weight-adjusted basis
respectively. The average AUCo._ for the disodium salt was 4073 ng-hr/mL and the
average AUCo._ for the diacid was 2217 ng-hr/mL.          The AUCo._ was found to be
dose proportional.    Thus, for beagle dogs similar to those tested, about 3 mg to
about 4 mg of the disodium salt would be expected to result in an AUCo._ of about
 100 ng-hr/mL, and about 7 mg to about 8 mg of the disodium salt would be expected
to result in an AUCo._ of about 200 ng-hr/mL.
Example 8
        [0246]    Tablets were prepared by blending zoledronic acid, either in the
form of the free acid or the disodium salt, with identical excipients. For dosage forms
with a greater amount of active, the amount of the excipients was reduced
proportionally to keep the weight of the tablet at about 100 mg.       After blending, the
ingredients were compressed at varying pressures, followed by a film coating. The
resulting tablets were then tested for hardness using a Dr. Schleuniger Pharmatron
8M Tablet Hardness Tester. The results are shown in Table 2 and FIG. 9.

Example 9
       [0247]     Some embodiments related to joint pain, bone marrow lesions, and
osteoarthritis were conceived as a result of analyzing data from a clinical study.
Some of the results of this study were reported by Laslett et. al. in Ann Rheum Dis
2012;71:1322-1328.       Some of the description and data reported below was not
published prior to filing the present application. Fifty-two (52) patients with clinical
knee osteoarthritis and knee bone marrow lesions (BML) were randomized to
receive either intravenous zoledronic acid (5 mg) or placebo in a double blind
fashion.   All patients had to have at least one bone marrow lesion (BML) in the
affected knee on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). All patients had x-ray of the
knee for determination of joint space narrowing (JSN), which was graded according
to the Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI) atlas.       Patients had
either no joint space narrowing (OARSI Grade 0), or greater degrees of joint space
narrowing (OARSI Grade 1 and Grade 2).           Twenty six patients were treated with
zoledronic acid (8, 6, and 12 with OARSI Grades 0, 1, and 2, respectively). Twenty
six patients received placebo (8, 8, and 10 with OARSI Grades 0, 1 and 2,
respectively).
       [0248]      Pain intensity was assessed, at baseline and at three months, using
a 100 mm visual analog scale (VAS), with zero representing no pain and 100
representing extreme pain. The change in pain intensity from baseline to 3 months
was calculated.

was used if more than one was present at the same site. Each patient was given a
BML score (mm 2 ) at each of the four sites (medial tibial, medial femoral, lateral tibial,
and lateral femoral sites) and these were summed to create a total BML score
(mm 2 ).   The change in the total area of BMLs from baseline to 6 months was
calculated.
         [0254]    The size of BMLs was reduced with zoledronic acid treatment. As
shown in FIG. 13 and Table 6, average BML area decreased by approximately 190
mm2    as compared to placebo in the OARSI             Grade 0 group, but only by
approximately 33 mm2 as compared to placebo in patients with OARSI Grades 1-2.

Methods
         [0255]     A study was performed to evaluate the efficacy of a single
intravenous infusion of 5 mg ZA in comparison with intravenous placebo infusion
among patients with chronic low back pain (LBP) and Modic changes on MRI. This
study was a double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial in patients
with low back pain (LBP). Patients were included in the study if they had low back
symptoms for at least three months, a LBP of at least six (6) on a 10-cm Visual
Analog Scale (VAS) or an Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) of at least 30%, and an
M1, mixed M1/2 or M2 type change on MRI performed within six months at most
prior to enrolment.
         [0256]     Patients were excluded from the study if they had renal impairment
with reduced creatinine clearance defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate
(eGFR) below 40 ml/min, hypocalcemia, known hypersensitivity to zoledronic acid or
other bisphosphonates or ingredients of the infusion product, the presence of red
flags, nerve root entrapment or willingness for early retirement. Premenopausal
women of childbearing potential were also excluded. Blood samples were taken prior
to the infusion to assess the serum concentration of calcium and creatinine. The
clinical examination included medical history and clinical assessment of lumbar
flexibility, tendon signs, and motor and sensory testing.
         [0257]     After confirmation of eligibility patients were randomized to receive
a single intravenous infusion of 5 mg zoledronic acid (n = 20) or 100 ml saline as
placebo (n = 20) over a 15-minute period. Information on use of the concomitant
medication and hospital admissions were recorded. Blood samples were taken for
the assessment of safety, inflammatory mediators and markers of bone turnover at
baseline, one month and one year.
         [0258]     Clinical assessments were performed 14 days before enrolment
(screening visit), and follow-up visits at one month and one year after the infusion.
The primary outcome was the change in the intensity of LBP on VAS. Secondary
outcomes included leg pain intensity, ODI, health-related quality of life assessed with
RAND-36,       patient-reported sick leaves and lumbar flexibility. These outcome
measures were assessed at baseline and at each follow-up. Lumbar flexibility was
                                              67

WO 2015/184003                                                        PCT/US2015/032739
evaluated using the fingers-to-floor and trunk side bending measures (in cm). The
percentage of patients undergoing a 20% relative improvement, the proportion of
patients reaching a VAS score of 40 or less in the primary outcome, and patient
acceptable symptom state (PASS) were also assessed. Pain medication use was
inquired about during the follow-up visits.
Results
        [0259]    Zoledronic acid treatment resulted in a greater improvement in LBP
intensity at one month as compared to placebo treatment. Furthermore, the patients
receiving zoledronic acid reported NSAID use at one year significantly less often
than those in the placebo group. Overall, the improvements in most of the evaluated
parameters were greater in the zoledronic acid group throughout the follow-up
period.
        [0260]    The clinical characteristics of study participants at baseline are
displayed in Table 6. The mean LBP duration was 293 days, initial LBP intensity on
VAS 6.7, leg pain on VAS 2.9 and the ODI score was 32%. Altogether 19 patients in
the ZA group and 18 in the placebo group had a M1/2 lesion. Modic changes were
most commonly (70%) situated at L4/5 or L5/S1. The zoledronic acid and placebo
groups were similar as regards the demographic and background characteristics of
all patients at baseline (Table 6).
        [0261]    The mean difference (MD) between the treatment groups in the
primary outcome, intensity of LBP, significantly favored zoledronic acid at one month
(MD 1.4; 95% Cl 0.01 to 2.9) while at one year no significant difference was
observed (MD 0.7; 95% Cl -1.0 to 2.4; Table 7). The proportion of patients with at
least 20% improvement in intensity of LBP and PASS both favored the zoledronic
acid treatment at one month: zoledronic acid 55% vs. placebo 25% (p = 0.105) and
zoledronic acid 50% vs. placebo 20% (p = 0.096), respectively.
        [0262]     For the patients who were treated with zoledronic acid, the
reduction in pain intensity was greater in those with greater baseline pain intensity as
shown in Table 9. The mean reduction in pain from baseline was 3.4 for patients with
baseline pain intensity    7, as compared to a reduction of only 0.1 for patients with a
baseline pain intensity < 6.

            [0263]     Of the secondary outcomes, the improvement in ODI, favored
zoledronic acid at 1 month, the adjusted between-group difference being 6.0% (95%
Cl -0.6 to 13), but not at one year (Table 7). Similarly, side bending (to right and left)
favored the zoledronic acid treatment at one month but not at one year (Table 7).
Changes in total RAND-36, and in the physical and mental components of RAND-36
are shown in Table 8.
            [0264]     At baseline, there were no differences in self-reported use of non
steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) between the treatment groups, whereas
at one year, only 20% of patients in the ZA group used NSAIDs versus 60% in the
placebo group.
