                                       BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
[0004] The provision of two distinct signals to T-cells is a widely accepted model for
lymphocyte activation of resting T lymphocytes by antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Lafferty
et al, Aust. J. Exp. Biol. Med. ScL 53: 27-42 (1975). This model further provides for the
discrimination of self from non-self and immune tolerance. Bretscher et al, Science 169:
 1042-1049 (1970); Bretscher, P.A., P.N.A.S. USA 96: 185-190 (1999); Jenkins et al, J. Exp.
Med. 165: 302-319 (1987). The primary signal, or antigen specific signal, is transduced
through the T- cell receptor (TCR) following recognition of foreign antigen peptide presented
in the context of the major histocompatibility-complex (MHC). The second or co
stimulatory signal is delivered to T-cells by co-stimulatory molecules expressed on antigen
presenting cells (APCs), and induce T-cells to promote clonal expansion, cytokine secretion
and effector function. Lenschow et al., Ann. Rev. Immunol. 14:233 (1996). In the absence of
co-stimulation, T-cells can become refractory to antigen stimulation, do not mount an
effective immune response, and further may result in exhaustion or tolerance to foreign
antigens.

[0005]           In the two-signal model T-cells receive both positive and negative secondary co
stimulatory signals. The regulation of such positive and negative signals is critical to
maximize the host's protective immune responses, while maintaining immune tolerance and
preventing autoimmunity. Negative secondary signals seem necessary for induction of T-cell
tolerance, while positive signals promote T-cell activation. While the simple two-signal
model still provides a valid explanation for naive lymphocytes, a host's immune response is a
dynamic process, and co- stimulatory signals can also be provided to antigen-exposed T
cells. The mechanism of co-stimulation is of therapeutic interest because the manipulation of
co-stimulatory signals has shown to provide a means to either enhance or terminate cell
based immune response. Recently, it has been discovered that T cell dysfunction or anergy
occurs concurrently with an induced and sustained expression of the inhibitory receptor,
programmed death 1 polypeptide (PD-1). As a result, therapeutic targeting of PD-i and other
molecules which signal through interactions with PD-1, such as programmed death ligand 1
(PD-Ll) and programmed death ligand 2 (PD-L2) are an area of intense interest.
[0006]           PD-LI is overexpressed in many cancers and is often associated with poor
prognosis (Okazaki T et al., Intern. Immun. 2007 19(7):813) (Thompson RH et al., Cancer
Res 2006, 66(7):3381). Interestingly, the majority of tumor infiltrating T lymphocytes
predominantly express PD-1, in contrast to T lymphocytes in normal tissues and peripheral
blood T lymphocytes indicating that up-regulation of PD-i on tumor-reactive T cells can
contribute to impaired antitumor immune responses (Blood 2009 114(8):1537). This may be
due to exploitation of PD-Li signaling mediated by PD-Li expressing tumor cells interacting
with PD-i expressing T cells to result in attenuation of T cell activation and evasion of
immune surveillance (Sharpe et al., Nat Rev 2002) (Keir ME et al., 2008 Annu. Rev.
Immunol. 26:677). Therefore, inhibition of the PD-Li/PD-i interaction may enhance CD8+
T cell-mediated killing of tumors.
[0007] The inhibition of PD-i axis signaling through its direct ligands (e.g., PD-L1, PD-L2)
has been proposed as a means to enhance T cell immunity for the treatment of cancer (e.g.,
tumor immunity). Moreover, similar enhancements to T cell immunity have been observed
by inhibiting the binding of PD-Li to the binding partner B7-1. Optimal therapeutic
treatment could combine blockade of PD-I receptor/ligand interaction with other anti-cancer
agents. There remains a need for such an optimal therapy for treating, stabilizing, preventing,
and/or delaying development of various cancers.

I.           Definitions
 [0022] The term "PD-1 axis bindingantagonist"is a molecule that inhibits the interaction of
a PD-I axis binding partner with either one or more of its binding partner, so as to remove T
cell dysfunction resulting from signaling on the PD-I signaling axis - with a result being to
restore or enhance T-cell function. As used herein, a PD-i axis binding antagonist includes a
PD-i binding antagonist, a PD-Li binding antagonist and a PD-L2 binding antagonist.
 [0023] The term "PD-1 binding antagonists" is a molecule that decreases, blocks, inhibits,
abrogates or interferes with signal transduction resulting from the interaction of PD-i with
one or more of its binding partners, such as PD-Li, PD-L2. In some embodiments, the PD-i
binding antagonist is a molecule that inhibits the binding of PD-I to its binding partners. In a
specific aspect, the PD-i binding antagonist inhibits the binding of PD-i to PD-Li and/or
PD-L2. For example, PD-i binding antagonists include anti-PD-i antibodies, antigen
binding fragments thereof, immunoadhesins, fusion proteins, oligopeptides and other
molecules that decrease, block, inhibit, abrogate or interfere with signal transduction
resulting from the interaction of PD-I with PD-Li and/or PD-L2. In one embodiment, a PD
 1 binding antagonist reduces the negative co-stimulatory signal mediated by or through cell
surface proteins expressed on T lymphocytes mediated signaling through PD-i so as render a
dysfunctional T-cell less non-dysfunctional. In some embodiments, the PD-i binding
antagonist is an anti-PD-i antibody. In a specific aspect, a PD-i binding antagonist is MDX
 1106 described herein. In another specifc aspect, a PD-i binding antagonist is Merck 3745
                                                6
9786917_1 (GHMatters) P98670.AU.1

described herein. In another specifc aspect, a PD-I binding antagonist is CT-0I1 described
herein.
[0024] The term "PD-Li binding antagonists" is a molecule that decreases, blocks, inhibits,
abrogates or interferes with signal transduction resulting from the interaction of PD-LI with
either one or more of its binding partners, such as PD-1, B7-1. In some embodiments, a PD
LI binding antagonist is a molecule that inhibits the binding of PD-Li to its binding partners.
In a specific aspect, the PD-LI binding antagonist inhibits binding of PD-LI to PD-I and/or
B7-1. In some embodiments, the PD-Li binding antagonists include anti-PD-Li antibodies,
antigen binding fragments thereof, immunoadhesins, fusion proteins, oligopeptides and other
molecules that decrease, block, inhibit, abrogate or interfere with signal transduction
resulting from the interaction of PD-Li with one or more of its binding partners, such as PD
 1, B7-1. In one embodiment, a PD-Li binding antagonist reduces the negative co
stimulatory signal mediated by or through cell surface proteins expressed on T lymphocytes
mediated signaling through PD-LI so as render a dysfunctional T-cell less non-dysfunctional.
In some embodiments, a PD-Li binding antagonist is an anti-PD-Li antibody. In a specific
aspect, an anti-PD-Li antibody is YW243.55.S70 described herein. In another specific
aspect, an anti-PD-LI antibody is MDX- 1i05 described herein.
[0025] The term "PD-L2 binding antagonists" is a molecule that decreases, blocks, inhibits,
abrogates or interferes with signal transduction resulting from the interaction of PD-L2 with
either one or more of its binding partners, such as PD-1. In some embodiments, a PD-L2
binding antagonist is a molecule that inhibits the binding of PD-L2 to its binding partners. In
a specific aspect, the PD-L2 binding antagonist inhibits binding of PD-L2 to PD-1. In some
embodiments, the PD-L2 antagonists include anti-PD-L2 antibodies, antigen binding
fragments thereof, immunoadhesins, fusion proteins, oligopeptides and other molecules that
decrease, block, inhibit, abrogate or interfere with signal transduction resulting from the
interaction of PD-L2 with either one or more of its binding partners, such as PD-1. In one
embodiment, a PD-L2 binding antagonist reduces the negative co-stimulatory signal
mediated by or through cell surface proteins expressed on T lymphocytes mediated signaling
through PD-L2 so as render a dysfunctional T-cell less non-dysfunctional. In some
embodiments, a PD-L2 binding antagonist is a PD-L2 immunoadhesin. In a specific aspect, a
PD-L2 immunoadhesin is AMP-224 described herein.

[0026] A "VEGF antagonist" refers to a molecule capable of neutralizing, blocking,
inhibiting, abrogating, reducing or interfering with VEGF activities including its binding to
one or more VEGF receptors. VEGF antagonists include anti-VEGF antibodies and antigen
binding fragments thereof, receptor molecules and derivatives which bind specifically to
VEGF thereby sequestering its binding to one or more receptors, anti-VEGF receptor
antibodies and VEGF receptor antagonists such as small molecule inhibitors of the VEGFR
tyrosine kinases.
[0027] The term "VEGF" or "VEGF-A" is used to refer to the 165-amino acid human
vascular endothelial cell growth factor and related 121-, 145-, 189-, and 206- amino acid
human vascular endothelial cell growth factors, as described by, e.g., Leung et al. Science,
246:1306 (1989), and Houck et al. Mol. Endocrin., 5:1806 (1991), together with the naturally
occurring allelic and processed forms thereof. VEGF-A is part of a gene family including
VEGF-B, VEGF-C, VEGF-D, VEGF-E, VEGF-F, and PlGF. VEGF-A primarily binds to
two high affinity receptor tyrosine kinases, VEGFR-1 (Flt-1) and VEGFR-2 (Flk-1/KDR),
the latter being the major transmitter of vascular endothelial cell mitogenic signals of VEGF
A. Additionally, neuropilin- 1 has been identified as a receptor for heparin-binding VEGF-A
isoforms, and may play a role in vascular development. The term "VEGF" or "VEGF-A"
also refers to VEGFs from non-human species such as mouse, rat, or primate. Sometimes the
VEGF from a specific species is indicated by terms such as hVEGF for human VEGF or
mVEGF for murine VEGF. The term "VEGF" is also used to refer to truncated forms or
fragments of the polypeptide comprising amino acids 8 to 109 or 1 to 109 of the 165-amino
acid human vascular endothelial cell growth factor. Reference to any such forms of VEGF
may be identified in the present application, e.g., by "VEGF (8-109)," "VEGF (1-109)" or
"VEGF165." The amino acid positions for a "truncated" native VEGF are numbered as
indicated in the native VEGF sequence. For example, amino acid position 17 (methionine) in
truncated native VEGF is also position 17 (methionine) in native VEGF. The truncated
native VEGF has binding affinity for the KDR and Flt-1 receptors comparable to native
VEGF.
[0028] An "anti-VEGF antibody" is an antibody that binds to VEGF with sufficient affinity
and specificity. The antibody selected will normally have a binding affinity for VEGF, for
example, the antibody may bind hVEGF with a Kd value of between 100 nM-I pM.
Antibody affinities may be determined by a surface plasmon resonance based assay (such as
                                                8
9786917_1 (GHMatters) P98670.AU.1

the BlAcore assay as described in PCT Application Publication No. W02005/012359);
enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA); and competition assays (e.g. RIA' s), for
example. In certain embodiments, the anti-VEGF antibody of the invention can be used as a
therapeutic agent in targeting and interfering with diseases or conditions wherein the VEGF
activity is involved. Also, the antibody may be subjected to other biological activity assays,
e.g., in order to evaluate its effectiveness as a therapeutic. Such assays are known in the art
and depend on the target antigen and intended use for the antibody. Examples include the
HUVEC inhibition assay; tumor cell growth inhibition assays (as described in WO 89/06692,
for example); antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement-mediated
cytotoxicity (CDC) assays (US Patent 5,500,362); and agonistic activity or hematopoiesis
assays (see WO 95/27062). An anti-VEGF antibody will usually not bind to other VEGF
homologues such as VEGF-B or VEGF-C, nor other growth factors such as PlGF, PDGF or
bFGF.
[0029] A "chimeric VEGF receptor protein" is a VEGF receptor molecule having amino acid
sequences derived from at least two different proteins, at least one of which is as VEGF
receptor protein. In certain embodiments, the chimeric VEGF receptor protein is capable of
binding to and inhibiting the biological activity of VEGF.
[0030] An "anti-angiogenesis agent" or "angiogenesis inhibitor" refers to a small molecular
weight substance, a polynucleotide, a polypeptide, an isolated protein, a recombinant protein,
an antibody, or conjugates or fusion proteins thereof, that inhibits angiogenesis,
vasculogenesis, or undesirable vascular permeability, either directly or indirectly. It should
be understood that the anti-angiogenesis agent includes those agents that bind and block the
angiogenic activity of the angiogenic factor or its receptor. For example, an anti
angiogenesis agent is an antibody or other antagonist to an angiogenic agent as defined
above, e.g., antibodies to VEGF-A or to the VEGF-A receptor (e.g., KDR receptor or Flt-1
receptor), anti-PDGFR inhibitors such as GleevecT M (Imatinib Mesylate). Anti-angiogensis
agents also include native angiogenesis inhibitors, e.g., angiostatin, endostatin, etc. See, e.g.,

Oncogene, 22:3172-3179 (2003) (e.g., Table 3 listing anti-angiogenic therapy in malignant
melanoma); Ferrara & Alitalo, Nature Medicine 5:1359-1364 (1999); Tonini et al.,
Oncogene, 22:6549-6556 (2003) (e.g., Table 2 listing known antiangiogenic factors); and

[0031]           The term "dysfunction" in the context of immune dysfunction, refers to a state of
immune reduced responsiveness to antigenic stimulation. The term includes the common
elements of both exhaustion and/or anergy in which antigen recognition may occur, but the
ensuing immune response is ineffective to control infection or tumor growth.
 [0032]          "Enhancing T-cellfunction " means to induce, cause or stimulate a T-cell to have a
sustained or amplified biological function, or renew or reactivate exhausted or inactive T
cells. Examples of enhancing T-cell function include: increased secretion of y-interferon
from CD8+ T-cells, increased proliferation, increased antigen responsiveness (e.g., viral or
pathogen clearance) relative to such levels before the intervention. In one embodiment, the
level of enhancement is as least 50%, alternatively 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 100%, 120%,
 150%, 200%. The manner of measuring this enhancement is known to one of ordinary skill
in the art.
[0033]           A "T cell dysfunctional disorder"is a disorder or condition of T-cells characterized
by decreased responsiveness to antigenic stimulation. In a particular embodiment, a T-cell
dysfunctional disorder is a disorder that is specifically associated with inappropriate
increased signaling through PD-1. In another embodiment, T-cell dysfunctional disorder is
one in which T-cells are anergic or have decreased ability to secrete cytokines, proliferate, or
execute cytolytic activity. In a specific aspect, the decreased responsiveness results in
ineffective control of a pathogen or tumor expressing an immunogen. Examples of T cell
dysfunctional disorders characterized by T-cell dysfunction include unresolved acute
infection, chronic infection and tumor immunity.
[0034]            "Tumor immunity" refers to the process in which tumors evade immune recognition
and clearance. Thus, as a therapeutic concept, tumor immunity is "treated" when such
evasion is attenuated, and the tumors are recognized and attacked by the immune system.
Examples of tumor recognition include tumor binding, tumor shrinkage and tumor clearance.
[0035]            "Immunogenecity " refers to the ability of a particular substance to provoke an
immune response. Tumors are immunogenic and enhancing tumor immunogenicity aids in
the clearance of the tumor cells by the immune response. Examples of enhancing tumor
immunogenicity include treatment with anti-PDL antibodies oxaliplatin, leucovorin and 5-FU
with or without a VEGF antagonist.

[0036]           "Sustainedresponse" refers to the sustained effect on reducing tumor growth after
cessation of a treatment. For example, the tumor size may remain to be the same or smaller
as compared to the size at the beginning of the administration phase. In some embodiments,
the sustained response has a duration at least the same as the treatment duration, at least 1.5X,
2.0X, 2.5X, or 3.0X length of the treatment duration.
[0037]           The term "antibody" includes monoclonal antibodies (including full length
antibodies which have an immunoglobulin Fc region), antibody compositions with
polyepitopic specificity, multispecific antibodies (e.g., bispecific antibodies, diabodies, and
single-chain molecules, as well as antibody fragments (e.g., Fab, F(ab') 2, and Fv). The term
"immunoglobulin" (Ig) is used interchangeably with "antibody" herein.
[0038]           The basic 4-chain antibody unit is a heterotetrameric glycoprotein composed of two
identical light (L) chains and two identical heavy (H) chains. An IgM antibody consists of 5
of the basic heterotetramer units along with an additional polypeptide called a J chain, and
contains 10 antigen binding sites, while IgA antibodies comprise from 2-5 of the basic 4
chain units which can polymerize to form polyvalent assemblages in combination with the J
chain. In the case of IgGs, the 4-chain unit is generally about 150,000 daltons. Each L chain
is linked to an H chain by one covalent disulfide bond, while the two H chains are linked to
each other by one or more disulfide bonds depending on the H chain isotype. Each H and L
chain also has regularly spaced intrachain disulfide bridges. Each H chain has at the N
terminus, a variable domain (VH) followed by three constant domains (CH) for each of the c
and y chains and four CH domains for pL and , isotypes. Each L chain has at the N-terminus, a
variable domain (VL) followed by a constant domain at its other end. The VL is aligned with
the VH and the CL is aligned with the first constant domain of the heavy chain (CH)
Particular amino acid residues are believed to form an interface between the light chain and
heavy chain variable domains. The pairing of a VH and VL together forms a single antigen
binding site. For the structure and properties of the different classes of antibodies, see e.g.,
Basic and ClinicalImmunology, 8th Edition, Daniel P. Sties, Abba I. Terr and Tristram G.
Parsolw (eds), Appleton & Lange, Norwalk, CT, 1994, page 71 and Chapter 6. The L chain
from any vertebrate species can be assigned to one of two clearly distinct types, called kappa
and lambda, based on the amino acid sequences of their constant domains. Depending on the
amino acid sequence of the constant domain of their heavy chains (CH), immunoglobulins
can be assigned to different classes or isotypes. There are five classes of immunoglobulins:
IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG and IgM, having heavy chains designated a, 6, E, y and Vt, respectively.
                                                      11
9786917_1 (GHMatters) P98670.AU.1

The y and c classes are further divided into subclasses on the basis of relatively minor
differences in the CH sequence and function, e.g., humans express the following subclasses:
IgGI, IgG2A, IgG2B, IgG3, IgG4, IgAl and IgA2.
[0039]           The "variableregion" or "variabledomain" of an antibody refers to the amino
terminal domains of the heavy or light chain of the antibody. The variable domains of the
heavy chain and light chain may be referred to as "VI" and "VL", respectively. These
domains are generally the most variable parts of the antibody (relative to other antibodies of
the same class) and contain the antigen binding sites.
[0040]           The term "variable"refers to the fact that certain segments of the variable domains
differ extensively in sequence among antibodies. The V domain mediates antigen binding
and defines the specificity of a particular antibody for its particular antigen. However, the
variability is not evenly distributed across the entire span of the variable domains. Instead, it
is concentrated in three segments called hypervariable regions (HVRs) both in the light-chain
and the heavy chain variable domains. The more highly conserved portions of variable
domains are called the framework regions (FR). The variable domains of native heavy and
light chains each comprise four FR regions, largely adopting a beta-sheet configuration,
connected by three HVRs, which form loops connecting, and in some cases forming part of,
the beta-sheet structure. The HVRs in each chain are held together in close proximity by the
FR regions and, with the HVRs from the other chain, contribute to the formation of the
antigen binding site of antibodies (see Kabat et al., Sequences ofImmunological Interest,
Fifth Edition, National Institute of Health, Bethesda, MD (1991)). The constant domains are
not involved directly in the binding of antibody to an antigen, but exhibit various effector
functions, such as participation of the antibody in antibody-dependent cellular toxicity.
[0041]           The term "monoclonalantibody" as used herein refers to an antibody obtained from
a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies, i.e., the individual antibodies
comprising the population are identical except for possible naturally occurring mutations
and/or post-translation modifications (e.g., isomerizations, amidations) that may be present in
minor amounts. Monoclonal antibodies are highly specific, being directed against a single
antigenic site. In contrast to polyclonal antibody preparations which typically include
different antibodies directed against different determinants (epitopes), each monoclonal
antibody is directed against a single determinant on the antigen. In addition to their
specificity, the monoclonal antibodies are advantageous in that they are synthesized by the
hybridoma culture, uncontaminated by other immunoglobulins. The modifier "monoclonal"
                                                     12

indicates the character of the antibody as being obtained from a substantially homogeneous
population of antibodies, and is not to be construed as requiring production of the antibody
by any particular method. For example, the monoclonal antibodies to be used in accordance
with the present invention may be made by a variety of techniques, including, for example,
the hybridoma method (e.g., Kohler and Milstein., Nature, 256:495-97 (1975); Hongo et al.,

 [0042]          The term "naked antibody" refers to an antibody that is not conjugated to a
cytotoxic moiety or radiolabel.
 [0043]          The terms "full-lengthantibody," "intact antibody" or "whole antibody" are used
interchangeably to refer to an antibody in its substantially intact form, as opposed to an
antibody fragment. Specifically whole antibodies include those with heavy and light chains
including an Fc region. The constant domains may be native sequence constant domains
(e.g., human native sequence constant domains) or amino acid sequence variants thereof. In
some cases, the intact antibody may have one or more effector functions.
 [0044]          An "antibodyfragment" comprises a portion of an intact antibody, preferably the
antigen binding and/or the variable region of the intact antibody. Examples of antibody
fragments include Fab, Fab', F(ab') 2 and Fv fragments; diabodies; linear antibodies (see U.S.
                                                     13

Patent 5,641,870, Example 2; Zapata et al., Protein Eng. 8(10): 1057-1062 [1995]); single
chain antibody molecules and multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragments.
Papain digestion of antibodies produced two identical antigen-binding fragments, called
"Fab" fragments, and a residual "Fc" fragment, a designation reflecting the ability to
crystallize readily. The Fab fragment consists of an entire L chain along with the variable
region domain of the H chain (VH), and the first constant domain of one heavy chain (CHI)
Each Fab fragment is monovalent with respect to antigen binding, i.e., it has a single antigen
binding site. Pepsin treatment of an antibody yields a single large F(ab') 2 fragment which
roughly corresponds to two disulfide linked Fab fragments having different antigen-binding
activity and is still capable of cross-linking antigen. Fab' fragments differ from Fab
fragments by having a few additional residues at the carboxy terminus of the CH1 domain
including one or more cysteines from the antibody hinge region. Fab'-SH is the designation
herein for Fab' in which the cysteine residue(s) of the constant domains bear a free thiol
group. F(ab') 2 antibody fragments originally were produced as pairs of Fab' fragments which
have hinge cysteines between them. Other chemical couplings of antibody fragments are also
known.
 [0045]          The Fc fragment comprises the carboxy-terminal portions of both H chains held
together by disulfides. The effector functions of antibodies are determined by sequences in
the Fc region, the region which is also recognized by Fc receptors (FcR) found on certain
types of cells.
 [0046]          "Fv" is the minimum antibody fragment which contains a complete antigen
recognition and -binding site. This fragment consists of a dimer of one heavy- and one light
chain variable region domain in tight, non-covalent association. From the folding of these
two domains emanate six hypervariable loops (3 loops each from the H and L chain) that
contribute the amino acid residues for antigen binding and confer antigen binding specificity
to the antibody. However, even a single variable domain (or half of an Fv comprising only
three HVRs specific for an antigen) has the ability to recognize and bind antigen, although at
a lower affinity than the entire binding site.
 [0047]           "Single-chainFv " also abbreviated as "sFv " or "scFv " are antibody fragments that
comprise the VH and VL antibody domains connected into a single polypeptide chain.
Preferably, the sFv polypeptide further comprises a polypeptide linker between the VH and
VL domains which enables the sFv to form the desired structure for antigen binding. For a
                                                     14

Rosenburg and Moore eds., Springer-Verlag, New York, pp. 269-315 (1994).
[0048]           "Functionalfragments"of the antibodies of the invention comprise a portion of an
intact antibody, generally including the antigen binding or variable region of the intact
antibody or the Fc region of an antibody which retains or has modified FcR binding
capability. Examples of antibody fragments include linear antibody, single-chain antibody
molecules and multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragments.
[0049]           The term "diabodies" refers to small antibody fragments prepared by constructing
sFv fragments (see preceding paragraph) with short linkers (about 5-10) residues) between
the VH and VL domains such that inter-chain but not intra-chain pairing of the V domains is
achieved, thereby resulting in a bivalent fragment, i.e., a fragment having two antigen
binding sites. Bispecific diabodies are heterodimers of two "crossover" sFv fragments in
which the VH and VL domains of the two antibodies are present on different polypeptide
chains. Diabodies are described in greater detail in, for example, EP 404,097; WO 93/11161;

[0050]           The monoclonal antibodies herein specifically include "chimeric" antibodies
(immunoglobulins) in which a portion of the heavy and/or light chain is identical with or
homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from a particular species or
belonging to a particular antibody class or subclass, while the remainder of the chain(s)
is(are) identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from
another species or belonging to another antibody class or subclass, as well as fragments of
such antibodies, so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity (U.S. Patent No.
4,816,567; Morrison et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 8:6851-6855 (1984)). Chimeric
antibodies of interest herein include PRIMATIZED* antibodies wherein the antigen-binding
region of the antibody is derived from an antibody produced by, e.g., immunizing macaque
monkeys with an antigen of interest. As used herein, "humanized antibody" is used a subset
of "chimeric antibodies."
 [0051]          "Humanized"forms of non-human (e.g., murine) antibodies are chimeric antibodies
that contain minimal sequence derived from non-human immunoglobulin. In one
embodiment, a humanized antibody is a human immunoglobulin (recipient antibody) in
which residues from an HVR (hereinafter defined) of the recipient are replaced by residues
from an HVR of a non-human species (donor antibody) such as mouse, rat, rabbit or non
human primate having the desired specificity, affinity, and/or capacity. In some instances,
                                                     15
9786917_1 (GHMatters) P98670.AU.1

framework ("FR") residues of the human immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding
non-human residues. Furthermore, humanized antibodies may comprise residues that are not
found in the recipient antibody or in the donor antibody. These modifications may be made
to further refine antibody performance, such as binding affinity. In general, a humanized
antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one, and typically two, variable domains,
in which all or substantially all of the hypervariable loops correspond to those of a non
human immunoglobulin sequence, and all or substantially all of the FR regions are those of a
human immunoglobulin sequence, although the FR regions may include one or more
individual FR residue substitutions that improve antibody performance, such as binding
affinity, isomerization, immunogenicity, etc. The number of these amino acid substitutions
in the FR are typically no more than 6 in the H chain, and in the L chain, no more than 3.
The humanized antibody optionally will also comprise at least a portion of an
immunoglobulin constant region (Fc), typically that of a human immunoglobulin. For further
details, see, e.g., Jones et al., Nature 321:522-525 (1986); Riechmann et al., Nature 332:323
329 (1988); and Presta, Curr. Op. Struct. Biol. 2:593-596 (1992). See also, for example,

 [0052]          A "human antibody" is an antibody that possesses an amino-acid sequence
corresponding to that of an antibody produced by a human and/or has been made using any of
the techniques for making human antibodies as disclosed herein. This definition of a human
antibody specifically excludes a humanized antibody comprising non-human antigen-binding
residues. Human antibodies can be produced using various techniques known in the art,
including phage-display libraries. Hoogenboom and Winter, J Mol. Biol., 227:381 (1991);
Marks et al., J Mol. Biol., 222:581 (1991). Also available for the preparation of human
monoclonal antibodies are methods described in Cole et al., Monoclonal Antibodies and
Cancer Therapy, Alan R. Liss, p. 77 (1985); Boemer et al., J Immunol., 147(1):86-95
(1991). See also van Dijk and van de Winkel, Curr. Opin. Pharmacol., 5: 368-74 (2001).
Human antibodies can be prepared by administering the antigen to a transgenic animal that
has been modified to produce such antibodies in response to antigenic challenge, but whose
endogenous loci have been disabled, e.g., immunized xenomice (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos.
6,075,181 and 6,150,584 regarding XENOMOUSETM technology). See also, for example, Li

[0053]           The term "hypervariableregion," "HVR," or "HV," when used herein refers to the
regions of an antibody variable domain which are hypervariable in sequence and/or form
structurally defined loops. Generally, antibodies comprise six HVRs; three in the VH (HI,
H2, H3), and three in the VL (LI, L2, L3). In native antibodies, H3 and L3 display the most
diversity of the six HVRs, and H3 in particular is believed to play a unique role in conferring
fine specificity to antibodies. See, e.g., Xu et al., Immunity 13:37-45 (2000); Johnson and
Wu, in Methods in Molecular Biology 248:1-25 (Lo, ed., Human Press, Totowa, NJ, 2003).
Indeed, naturally occurring camelid antibodies consisting of a heavy chain only are functional
and stable in the absence of light chain. See, e.g., Hamers-Castermanet al., Nature 363:446
448 (1993); Sheriff et al., Nature Struct. Biol. 3:733-736 (1996).
[0054]           A number of HVR delineations are in use and are encompassed herein. The Kabat
Complementarity Determining Regions (CDRs) are based on sequence variability and are the
most commonly used (Kabat et al., Sequences ofProteins ofImmunologicalInterest, 5th Ed.
Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD. (1991)). Chothia refers
instead to the location of the structural loops (Chothia and Lesk, J Mol. Biol. 196:901-917
(1987)). The AbM HVRs represent a compromise between the Kabat HVRs and Chothia
structural loops, and are used by Oxford Molecular's AbM antibody modeling software. The
"contact" HVRs are based on an analysis of the available complex crystal structures. The
residues from each of these HVRs are noted below.

[0055]           HVRs may comprise "extended HVRs" as follows: 24-36 or 24-34 (LI), 46-56 or
50-56 (L2) and 89-97 or 89-96 (L3) in the VL and 26-35 (HI), 50-65 or 49-65 (H2) and 93
 102, 94-102, or 95-102 (H3) in the VH. The variable domain residues are numbered
according to Kabat et al., supra, for each of these definitions.
 [0056]          The expression "variable-domainresidue-numberingas in Kabat" or "amino-acid
position numbering as in Kabat," and variations thereof, refers to the numbering system used
                                                   17
9786917_1 (GHMatters) P98670.AU.1

for heavy-chain variable domains or light-chain variable domains of the compilation of
antibodies in Kabat et al., supra. Using this numbering system, the actual linear amino acid
sequence may contain fewer or additional amino acids corresponding to a shortening of, or
insertion into, a FR or HVR of the variable domain. For example, a heavy-chain variable
domain may include a single amino acid insert (residue 52a according to Kabat) after residue
52 of H2 and inserted residues (e.g. residues 82a, 82b, and 82c, etc. according to Kabat) after
heavy-chain FR residue 82. The Kabat numbering of residues may be determined for a given
antibody by alignment at regions of homology of the sequence of the antibody with a
"standard" Kabat numbered sequence.
[0057]           "Framework"or "FR" residues are those variable-domain residues other than the
HVR residues as herein defined.
[0058]           A "human consensusframework" or "acceptor humanframework" is a framework
that represents the most commonly occurring amino acid residues in a selection of human
immunoglobulin VL or VH framework sequences. Generally, the selection of human
immunoglobulin VL or VH sequences is from a subgroup of variable domain sequences.
Generally, the subgroup of sequences is a subgroup as in Kabat et al., Sequences ofProteins
ofImmunological Interest, 5th Ed. Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health,
Bethesda, MD (1991). Examples include for the VL, the subgroup may be subgroup kappa I,
kappa II, kappa III or kappa IV as in Kabat et al., supra. Additionally, for the VH, the
subgroup may be subgroup I, subgroup II, or subgroup III as in Kabat et al., supra.
Alternatively, a human consensus framework can be derived from the above in which
particular residues, such as when a human framework residue is selected based on its
homology to the donor framework by aligning the donor framework sequence with a
collection of various human framework sequences. An acceptor human framework "derived
from" a human immunoglobulin framework or a human consensus framework may comprise
the same amino acid sequence thereof, or it may contain pre-existing amino acid sequence
changes. In some embodiments, the number of pre-existing amino acid changes are 10 or
less, 9 or less, 8 or less, 7 or less, 6 or less, 5 or less, 4 or less, 3 or less, or 2 or less.
[0059]           A "VH subgroup III consensusframework" comprises the consensus sequence
obtained from the amino acid sequences in variable heavy subgroup III of Kabat et al., supra.
In one embodiment, the VH subgroup III consensus framework amino acid sequence
comprises at least a portion or all of each of the following sequences:

[0060]           A "VL kappa I consensusframework" comprises the consensus sequence obtained
from the amino acid sequences in variable light kappa subgroup I of Kabat et al., supra. In
one embodiment, the VH subgroup I consensus framework amino acid sequence comprises at
least a portion or all of each of the following sequences: DIQMTQSPSSLSASVGDRVTITC

[0061]           An "amino-acidmodification" at a specified position, e.g. of the Fc region, refers to
the substitution or deletion of the specified residue, or the insertion of at least one amino acid
residue adjacent the specified residue. Insertion "adjacent" to a specified residue means
insertion within one to two residues thereof. The insertion may be N-terminal or C-terminal
to the specified residue. The preferred amino acid modification herein is a substitution.
[0062]           An "affinity-matured" antibody is one with one or more alterations in one or more
HVRs thereof that result in an improvement in the affinity of the antibody for antigen,
compared to a parent antibody that does not possess those alteration(s). In one embodiment,
an affinity-matured antibody has nanomolar or even picomolar affinities for the target
antigen. Affinity-matured antibodies are produced by procedures known in the art. For
example, Marks et al., Bio/Technology 10:779-783 (1992) describes affinity maturation by
VH- and VL-domain shuffling. Random mutagenesis of HVR and/or framework residues is
described by, for example: Barbas et al. Proc Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 91:3809-3813 (1994);

[0063]           As use herein, the term "specifically binds to" or is "specificfor"refers to
measurable and reproducible interactions such as binding between a target and an antibody,
which is determinative of the presence of the target in the presence of a heterogeneous
population of molecules including biological molecules. For example, an antibody that
specifically binds to a target (which can be an epitope) is an antibody that binds this target
with greater affinity, avidity, more readily, and/or with greater duration than it binds to other
targets. In one embodiment, the extent of binding of an antibody to an unrelated target is less
than about 10% of the binding of the antibody to the target as measured, e.g., by a
                                                      19
9786917_1 (GHMatters) P98670.AU.1

radioimmunoassay (RIA). In certain embodiments, an antibody that specifically binds to a
target has a dissociation constant (Kd) of <4 [M, <100 nM, <0 nM, < nM, or          <0. 1 nM.
In certain embodiments, an antibody specifically binds to an epitope on a protein that is
conserved among the protein from different species. In another embodiment, specific
binding can include, but does not require exclusive binding.
[0064]           As used herein, the term "immunoadhesin" designates antibody-like molecules
which combine the binding specificity of a heterologous protein (an "adhesin") with the
effector functions of immunoglobulin constant domains. Structurally, the immunoadhesins
comprise a fusion of an amino acid sequence with the desired binding specificity which is
other than the antigen recognition and binding site of an antibody (i.e., is "heterologous"),
and an immunoglobulin constant domain sequence. The adhesin part of an immunoadhesin
molecule typically is a contiguous amino acid sequence comprising at least the binding site of
a receptor or a ligand. The immunoglobulin constant domain sequence in the
immunoadhesin may be obtained from any immunoglobulin, such as IgG- 1, IgG-2 (including
IgG2A and IgG2B), IgG-3, or IgG-4 subtypes, IgA (including IgA-I and IgA-2), IgE, IgD or
IgM. The Ig fusions preferably include the substitution of a domain of a polypeptide or
antibody described herein in the place of at least one variable region within an Ig molecule.
In a particularly preferred embodiment, the immunoglobulin fusion includes the hinge, CH2
and CH3, or the hinge, CHI, CH2 and CH3 regions of an IgGI molecule. For the production
of immunoglobulin fusions see also US Patent No. 5,428,130 issued June 27, 1995. For
example, useful immunoadhesins as second medicaments useful for combination therapy
herein include polypeptides that comprise the extracellular or PD-i binding portions of PD
LI or PD-L2 or the extracellular or PD-Li or PD-L2 binding portions of PD-1, fused to a
constant domain of an immunoglobulin sequence, such as a PD-Li ECD - Fc, a PD-L2 ECD
- Fc, and a PD-I ECD - Fc, respectively. Immunoadhesin combinations of Ig Fc and ECD of
cell surface receptors are sometimes termed soluble receptors.
 [0065]          A 'fusion protein" and a "fusionpolypeptide" refer to a polypeptide having two
portions covalently linked together, where each of the portions is a polypeptide having a
different property. The property may be a biological property, such as activity in vitro or in
vivo. The property may also be simple chemical or physical property, such as binding to a
target molecule, catalysis of a reaction, etc. The two portions may be linked directly by a
single peptide bond or through a peptide linker but are in reading frame with each other.

[0066]           A "PD-1 oligopeptide," "PD-Li oligopeptide," or "PD-L2 oligopeptide" is an
oligopeptide that binds, preferably specifically, to a PD-1, PD-LI or PD-L2 negative
costimulatory polypeptide, respectively, including a receptor, ligand or signaling component,
respectively, as described herein. Such oligopeptides may be chemically synthesized using
known oligopeptide synthesis methodology or may be prepared and purified using
recombinant technology. Such oligopeptides are usually at least about 5 amino acids in
length, alternatively at least about 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22,

98, 99, or 100 amino acids in length or more. Such oligopeptides may be identified using
well known techniques. In this regard, it is noted that techniques for screening oligopeptide
libraries for oligopeptides that are capable of specifically binding to a polypeptide target are
well known in the art (see, e.g., U.S. Patent Nos. 5,556,762, 5,750,373, 4,708,871, 4,833,092,

[0067]           A "blocking" antibody or an "antagonist"antibody is one that inhibits or reduces a
biological activity of the antigen it binds. In some embodiments, blocking antibodies or
antagonist antibodies substantially or completely inhibit the biological activity of the antigen.
For example, a VEGF-specific antagonist antibody binds VEGF and inhibits the ability of
VEGF to induce vascular endothelial cell proliferation or to induce vascular permeability.
The anti-PD-LI antibodies of the invention block the signaling through PD-I so as to restore
a functional response by T-cells from a dysfunctional state to antigen stimulation.
[0068]           An "agonist" or activating antibody is one that enhances or initiates signaling by the
antigen to which it binds. In some embodiments, agonist antibodies cause or activate
signaling without the presence of the natural ligand.

[0069]           The term "Fc region" herein is used to define a C-terminal region of an
immunoglobulin heavy chain, including native-sequence Fc regions and variant Fc regions.
Although the boundaries of the Fc region of an immunoglobulin heavy chain might vary, the
human IgG heavy-chain Fc region is usually defined to stretch from an amino acid residue at
position Cys226, or from Pro230, to the carboxyl-terminus thereof. The C-terminal lysine
(residue 447 according to the EU numbering system) of the Fc region may be removed, for
example, during production or purification of the antibody, or by recombinantly engineering
the nucleic acid encoding a heavy chain of the antibody. Accordingly, a composition of
intact antibodies may comprise antibody populations with all K447 residues removed,
antibody populations with no K447 residues removed, and antibody populations having a
mixture of antibodies with and without the K447 residue. Suitable native-sequence Fc
regions for use in the antibodies of the invention include human IgG 1, IgG2 (IgG2A,
IgG2B), IgG3 and IgG4.
[0070]           "Fc receptor" or "FcR" describes a receptor that binds to the Fc region of an
antibody. The preferred FcR is a native sequence human FcR. Moreover, a preferred FcR is
one which binds an IgG antibody (a gamma receptor) and includes receptors of the FcyRI,
FcyRII, and FcyRIII subclasses, including allelic variants and alternatively spliced forms of
these receptors, FcyRII receptors include FcyRIIA (an "activating receptor") and Fc7 RIIB (an
"inhibiting receptor"), which have similar amino acid sequences that differ primarily in the
cytoplasmic domains thereof. Activating receptor FcyRIIA contains an immunoreceptor
tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) in its cytoplasmic domain. Inhibiting receptor
FcyRIIB contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif (ITIM) in its
cytoplasmic domain. (see M. Daeron, Annu. Rev. Immunol. 15:203-234 (1997). FcRs are
reviewed in Ravetch and Kinet, Annu. Rev. Immunol. 9: 457-92 (1991); Capel et al.,
Immunomethods 4: 25-34 (1994); and de Haas et al., J Lab. Clin. Med. 126: 330-41 (1995).
Other FcRs, including those to be identified in the future, are encompassed by the term "FcR"
herein.
[0071]           The term "Fc receptor" or "FcR" also includes the neonatal receptor, FcRn, which
is responsible for the transfer of maternal IgGs to the fetus. Guyer et al., J Immunol. 117:
587 (1976) and Kim et al., J Immunol. 24: 249 (1994). Methods of measuring binding to
FcRn are known (see, e.g., Ghetie and Ward, Immunol. Today 18: (12): 592-8 (1997); Ghetie
et al., Nature Biotechnology 15 (7): 637-40 (1997); Hinton et al., J Biol. Chem. 279 (8):

6213-6 (2004); WO 2004/92219 (Hinton et al.). Binding to FcRn in vivo and serum half-life
of human FcRn high-affinity binding polypeptides can be assayed, e.g., in transgenic mice or
transfected human cell lines expressing human FcRn, or in primates to which the
polypeptides having a variant Fc region are administered. WO 2004/42072 (Presta) describes
antibody variants which improved or diminished binding to FcRs. See also, e.g., Shields et
al., J Biol. Chem. 9(2): 6591-6604 (2001).
[0072            The phrase "substantiallyreduced," or "substantiallydifferent," as used herein,
denotes a sufficiently high degree of difference between two numeric values (generally one
associated with a molecule and the other associated with a reference/comparator molecule)
such that one of skill in the art would consider the difference between the two values to be of
statistical significance within the context of the biological characteristic measured by said
values (e.g., Kd values). The difference between said two values is, for example, greater than
about 10%, greater than about 20%, greater than about 30%, greater than about 40%, and/or
greater than about 50% as a function of the value for the reference/comparator molecule.
[0073            The term "substantiallysimilar" or "substantiallythe same," as used herein,
denotes a sufficiently high degree of similarity between two numeric values (for example,
one associated with an antibody of the invention and the other associated with a
reference/comparator antibody), such that one of skill in the art would consider the difference
between the two values to be of little or no biological and/or statistical significance within the
context of the biological characteristic measured by said values (e.g., Kd values). The
difference between said two values is, for example, less than about 50%, less than about
40%, less than about 30%, less than about 20%, and/or less than about 10% as a function of
the reference/comparator value.
[0074]           "Carriers"as used herein include pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, excipients,
or stabilizers that are nontoxic to the cell or mammal being exposed thereto at the dosages
and concentrations employed. Often the physiologically acceptable carrier is an aqueous pH
buffered solution. Examples of physiologically acceptable carriers include buffers such as
phosphate, citrate, and other organic acids; antioxidants including ascorbic acid; low
molecular weight (less than about 10 residues) polypeptide; proteins, such as serum albumin,
gelatin, or immunoglobulins; hydrophilic polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone; amino
acids such as glycine, glutamine, asparagine, arginine or lysine; monosaccharides,
disaccharides, and other carbohydrates including glucose, mannose, or dextrins; chelating
agents such as EDTA; sugar alcohols such as mannitol or sorbitol; salt-forming counterions
                                                    23

such as sodium; and/or nonionic surfactants such as TWEENTM, polyethylene glycol (PEG),
and PLURONICS TM.
[0075]           A "packageinsert" refers to instructions customarily included in commercial
packages of medicaments that contain information about the indications customarily included
in commercial packages of medicaments that contain information about the indications,
usage, dosage, administration, contraindications, other medicaments to be combined with the
packaged product, and/or warnings concerning the use of such medicaments, etc.
 [0076] As used herein, the term "treatment" refers to clinical intervention designed to alter
the natural course of the individual or cell being treated during the course of clinical
pathology. Desirable effects of treatment include decreasing the rate of disease progression,
ameliorating or palliating the disease state, and remission or improved prognosis. For
example, an individual is successfully "treated" if one or more symptoms associated with
cancer are mitigated or eliminated, including, but are not limited to, reducing the proliferation
of (or destroying) cancerous cells, decreasing symptoms resulting from the disease,
increasing the quality of life of those suffering from the disease, decreasing the dose of other
medications required to treat the disease, delaying the progression of the disease, and/or
prolonging survival of individuals.
 [0077]          As used herein, "delaying progression of a disease" means to defer, hinder, slow,
retard, stabilize, and/or postpone development of the disease (such as cancer). This delay can
be of varying lengths of time, depending on the history of the disease and/or individual being
treated. As is evident to one skilled in the art, a sufficient or significant delay can, in effect,
encompass prevention, in that the individual does not develop the disease. For example, a
late stage cancer, such as development of metastasis, may be delayed.
 [0078] An "effective amount" is at least the minimum concentration required to effect a
measurable improvement or prevention of a particular disorder. An effective amount herein
may vary according to factors such as the disease state, age, sex, and weight of the patient,
and the ability of the antibody to elicit a desired response in the individual. An effective
amount is also one in which any toxic or detrimental effects of the treatment are outweighed
by the therapeutically beneficial effects. For prophylactic use, beneficial or desired results
include results such as eliminating or reducing the risk, lessening the severity, or delaying the
onset of the disease, including biochemical, histological and/or behavioral symptoms of the
                                                     24
9786917_1 (GHMatters) P98670.AU.1

disease, its complications and intermediate pathological phenotypes presenting during
development of the disease. For therapeutic use, beneficial or desired results include clinical
results such as decreasing one or more symptoms resulting from the disease, increasing the
quality of life of those suffering from the disease, decreasing the dose of other medications
required to treat the disease, enhancing effect of another medication such as via targeting,
delaying the progression of the disease, and/or prolonging survival. In the case of cancer or
tumor, an effective amount of the drug may have the effect in reducing the number of cancer
cells; reducing the tumor size; inhibiting (i.e., slow to some extent or desirably stop) cancer
cell infiltration into peripheral organs; inhibit (i.e., slow to some extent and desirably stop)
tumor metastasis; inhibiting to some extent tumor growth; and/or relieving to some extent
one or more of the symptoms associated with the disorder. An effective amount can be
administered in one or more administrations. For purposes of this invention, an effective
amount of drug, compound, or pharmaceutical composition is an amount sufficient to
accomplish prophylactic or therapeutic treatment either directly or indirectly. As is
understood in the clinical context, an effective amount of a drug, compound, or
pharmaceutical composition may or may not be achieved in conjunction with another drug,
compound, or pharmaceutical composition. Thus, an "effective amount" may be considered
in the context of administering one or more therapeutic agents, and a single agent may be
considered to be given in an effective amount if, in conjunction with one or more other
agents, a desirable result may be or is achieved.
[0079]           As used herein, "in conjunction with" refers to administration of one treatment
modality in addition to another treatment modality. As such, "in conjunction with" refers to
administration of one treatment modality before, during, or after administration of the other
treatment modality to the individual.
[0080]           The terms "cancer" and "cancerous" refer to or describe the physiological condition
in mammals that is typically characterized by unregulated cell growth. Included in this
definition are benign and malignant cancers as well as dormant tumors or micrometastatses.
Examples of cancer include but are not limited to, carcinoma, lymphoma, blastoma, sarcoma,
and leukemia. More particular examples of such cancers include squamous cell cancer, lung
cancer (including small-cell lung cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, adenocarcinoma of the
lung, and squamous carcinoma of the lung), cancer of the peritoneum, hepatocellular cancer,
gastric or stomach cancer (including gastrointestinal cancer), pancreatic cancer, glioblastoma,

cervical cancer, ovarian cancer, liver cancer, bladder cancer, hepatoma, breast cancer, colon
cancer, colorectal cancer, endometrial or uterine carcinoma, salivary gland carcinoma, kidney
or renal cancer, liver cancer, prostate cancer, vulval cancer, thyroid cancer, hepatic carcinoma
and various types of head and neck cancer, as well as B-cell lymphoma (including low
grade/follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL); small lymphocytic (SL) NHL;
intermediate grade/follicular NHL; intermediate grade diffuse NHL; high grade
immunoblastic NHL; high grade lymphoblastic NHL; high grade small non-cleaved cell
NHL; bulky disease NHL; mantle cell lymphoma; AIDS-related lymphoma; and
Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia); chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL); acute
lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL); Hairy cell leukemia; chronic myeloblastic leukemia; and
post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD), as well as abnormal vascular
proliferation associated with phakomatoses, edema (such as that associated with brain
tumors), and Meigs' syndrome.
[0081]           By "metastasis" is meant the spread of cancer from its primary site to other places
in the body. Cancer cells can break away from a primary tumor, penetrate into lymphatic and
blood vessels, circulate through the bloodstream, and grow in a distant focus (metastasize) in
normal tissues elsewhere in the body. Metastasis can be local or distant. Metastasis is a
sequential process, contingent on tumor cells breaking off from the primary tumor, traveling
through the bloodstream, and stopping at a distant site. At the new site, the cells establish a
blood supply and can grow to form a life-threatening mass. Both stimulatory and inhibitory
molecular pathways within the tumor cell regulate this behavior, and interactions between the
tumor cell and host cells in the distant site are also significant.
[0082]           By "subject" is meant a mammal, including, but not limited to, a human or non
human mammal, such as a bovine, equine, canine, ovine, or feline. Preferably, the subject is
a human. Patients are also subjects herein.
[0083]           As used herein, "complete response" or "CR" refers to disappearance of all target
lesions; "partial response" or "PR" refers to at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest
diameters (SLD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline SLD; and "stable disease"
or "SD" refers to neither sufficient shrinkage of target lesions to qualify for PR, nor sufficient
increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest SLD since the treatment started.
[0084]           As used herein, "progressive disease" or "PD" refers to at least a 20% increase in
the SLD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest SLD recorded since the treatment
started or the presence of one or more new lesions.

[0085]           As used herein, "progression free survival" (PFS) refers to the length of time during
and after treatment during which the disease being treated (e.g., cancer) does not get worse.
Progression-free survival may include the amount of time patients have experienced a
complete response or a partial response, as well as the amount of time patients have
experienced stable disease.
[0086]           As used herein, "overall response rate" (ORR) refers to the sum of complete
response (CR) rate and partial response (PR) rate.
[0087]           As used herein, "overall survival" refers to the percentage of individuals in a group
who are likely to be alive after a particular duration of time.
[0088]           A "chemotherapeuticagent" is a chemical compound useful in the treatment of
cancer. Examples of chemotherapeutic agents include alkylating agents such as thiotepa and
cyclophosphamide (CYTOXAN@); alkyl sulfonates such as busulfan, improsulfan, and
piposulfan; aziridines such as benzodopa, carboquone, meturedopa, and uredopa;

function results from production in prokaryotic cells. In a still further specific aspect the
minimal effector function results from an "effector-less Fc mutation" or aglycosylation. In
still a further aspect, the effector-less Fc mutation is an N297A or D265A/N297A
substitution in the constant region.
[0131]           In a still further aspect, the nucleic acid further comprises a vector suitable for
expression of the nucleic acid encoding any of the previously described anti-PD-Li
antibodies. In a still further specific aspect, the vector further comprises a host cell suitable
for expression of the nucleic acid. In a still further specific aspect, the host cell is a
eukaryotic cell or a prokaryotic cell. In a still further specific aspect, the eukaryotic cell is a
mammalian cell, such as Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO).
 [0132]          The anti-PD-LI antibody or antigen binding fragment thereof, may be made using
methods known in the art, for example, by a process comprising culturing a host cell
containing nucleic acid encoding any of the previously described anti-PD-Li antibodies or
antigen-binding fragment in a form suitable for expression, under conditions suitable to
produce such antibody or fragment, and recovering the antibody or fragment.
 [0133]          In a still further embodiment, the invention provides for a composition comprising
an anti-PD-LI antibody or antigen binding fragment thereof as provided herein and at least
one pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.
 VEGF antagonists
 [0134]          The invention provides methods for treating cancer or slowing progression of
cancer in an individual comprising administering an effective amount of a PD-i pathway
antagonist and a VEGF antagonist in combination with oxaliplatin, leucovorin and 5-FU.
Any known VEGF antagonists are intended.
(i)              VEGF Antigen
 [0135]          The VEGF antigen to be used for production of antibodies may be, e.g., the
VEGF16 5 molecule as well as other isoforms of VEGF or a fragment thereof containing the
desired epitope. Other forms of VEGF useful for generating anti-VEGF antibodies of the
invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art.

[0136]           Human VEGF was obtained by first screening a cDNA library prepared from
human cells, using bovine VEGF cDNA as a hybridization probe. Leung et al. (1989)
Science, 246:1306. One cDNA identified thereby encodes a 165-amino acid protein having
greater than 95% homology to bovine VEGF; this 165-amino acid protein is typically
referred to as human VEGF (hVEGF) or VEGF1 65 . The mitogenic activity of human VEGF
was confirmed by expressing the human VEGF cDNA in mammalian host cells. Media
conditioned by cells transfected with the human VEGF cDNA promoted the proliferation of
capillary endothelial cells, whereas control cells did not. Leung et al. (1989) Science, supra.
[0137]           Although a vascular endothelial cell growth factor could be isolated and purified
from natural sources for subsequent therapeutic use, the relatively low concentrations of the
protein in follicular cells and the high cost, both in terms of effort and expense, of recovering
VEGF proved commercially unavailing. Accordingly, further efforts were undertaken to
clone and express VEGF via recombinant DNA techniques. (See, e.g., Ferrara,Laboratory
Investigation 72:615-618 (1995), and the references cited therein).
 [0138]          VEGF is expressed in a variety of tissues as multiple homodimeric forms (121, 145,
 165, 189, and 206 amino acids per monomer) resulting from alternative RNA splicing.
VEGF 12 1 is a soluble mitogen that does not bind heparin; the longer forms of VEGF bind
heparin with progressively higher affinity. The heparin-binding forms of VEGF can be
cleaved in the carboxy terminus by plasmin to release a diffusible form(s) of VEGF. Amino
acid sequencing of the carboxy terminal peptide identified after plasmin cleavage is Argiio
Alai 1 . Amino terminal "core" protein, VEGF (1-110) isolated as a homodimer, binds
neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (such as the antibodies referred to as 4.6.1 and 3.2E3.1.1)
and soluble forms of VEGF receptors with similar affinity compared to the intact VEGF16 5
homodimer.
 [0139]          Several molecules structurally related to VEGF have also been identified, including
placenta growth factor (PIGF), VEGF-B, VEGF-C, VEGF-D and VEGF-E. Ferrara and
Davis-Smyth (1987) Endocr. Rev., supra; Ogawa et al. J. BiologicalChem. 273:31273
31281(1998); Meyer et al. EMBO J, 18:363-374(1999). A receptor tyrosine kinase, Flt-4
(VEGFR-3), has been identified as the receptor for VEGF-C and VEGF-D. Joukov et al.
EMBO. J 15:1751(1996); Lee et al. Proc.Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 93:1988-1992(1996); Achen
et al. (1998) Proc. Natl. A cad. Sci. USA 95:548-553. VEGF-C has been shown to be
                                                      44
9786917_1 (GHMatters) P98670.AU.1

involved in the regulation of lymphatic angiogenesis. Jeltsch et al. Science 276:1423
 1425(1997).
[0140]           Two VEGF receptors have been identified, Flt-1 (also called VEGFR-1) and KDR
(also called VEGFR-2). Shibuya et al. (1990) Oncogene 8:519-527; de Vries et al. (1992)
Science 255:989-991; Terman et al. (1992) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 187:1579-1586.
Neuropilin-1 has been shown to be a selective VEGF receptor, able to bind the heparin
binding VEGF isoforms (Soker et al. (1998) Cell 92:735-45). Both Flt-I and KDR belong to
the family of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). The RTKs comprise a large family of
transmembrane receptors with diverse biological activities. At present, at least nineteen (19)
distinct RTK subfamilies have been identified. The receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) family
includes receptors that are crucial for the growth and differentiation of a variety of cell types
(Yarden and Ullrich (1988) Ann. Rev. Biochem. 57:433-478; Ullrich and Schlessinger (1990)
Cell 61:243-254). The intrinsic function of RTKs is activated upon ligand binding, which
results in phosphorylation of the receptor and multiple cellular substrates, and subsequently
in a variety of cellular responses (Ullrich & Schlessinger (1990) Cell 61:203-212). Thus,
receptor tyrosine kinase mediated signal transduction is initiated by extracellular interaction
with a specific growth factor (ligand), typically followed by receptor dimerization,
stimulation of the intrinsic protein tyrosine kinase activity and receptor trans
phosphorylation. Binding sites are thereby created for intracellular signal transduction
molecules and lead to the formation of complexes with a spectrum of cytoplasmic signaling
molecules that facilitate the appropriate cellular response. (e.g., cell division, differentiation,
metabolic effects, changes in the extracellular microenvironment) see, Schlessinger and
Ullrich (1992) Neuron 9:1-20. Structurally, both Flt-1 and KDR have seven
immunoglobulin-like domains in the extracellular domain, a single transmembrane region,
and a consensus tyrosine kinase sequence which is interrupted by a kinase-insert domain.

(ii)             Anti-VEGF Antibodies
[0141]           Anti-VEGF antibodies that are useful in the methods of the invention include any
antibody, or antigen binding fragment thereof, that bind with sufficient affinity and
specificity to VEGF and can reduce or inhibit the biological activity of VEGF. An anti
                                                    45

VEGF antibody will usually not bind to other VEGF homologues such as VEGF-B or VEGF
C, nor other growth factors such as PlGF, PDGF, or bFGF.
[0142]           In certain embodiments of the invention, the anti-VEGF antibodies include, but are
not limited to, a monoclonal antibody that binds to the same epitope as the monoclonal anti
VEGF antibody A4.6.1 produced by hybridoma ATCC HB 10709; a recombinant humanized
anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody generated according to Presta et al. (1997) Cancer Res.
57:4593-4599.                   In one embodiment, the anti-VEGF antibody is "Bevacizumab (BV)", also
known as "rhuMAb VEGF" or "AVASTIN@". It comprises mutated human IgGI
framework regions and antigen-binding complementarity-determining regions from the
murine anti-hVEGF monoclonal antibody A.4.6.1 that blocks binding of human VEGF to its
receptors. Approximately 93% of the amino acid sequence of bevacizumab, including most
of the framework regions, is derived from human IgG1, and about 7% of the sequence is
derived from the murine antibody A4.6. 1.
[0143]           Bevacizumab and other humanized anti-VEGF antibodies are further described in
U.S. Pat. No. 6,884,879 issued Feb. 26, 2005. Additional antibodies include the G6 or B20
series antibodies (e.g., G6-31, B20-4.1), as described in PCT Publication No.

[0146]           A "G6 series antibody" according to this invention, is an anti-VEGF antibody that is
derived from a sequence of a G6 antibody or G6-derived antibody according to any one of
Figures 7, 24-26, and 34-35 of PCT Publication No. W02005/012359, the entire disclosure
of which is expressly incorporated herein by reference. See also PCT Publication No.
W02005/044853, the entire disclosure of which is expressly incorporated herein by
reference. In one embodiment, the G6 series antibody binds to a functional epitope on
human VEGF comprising residues F17, Y21, Q22, Y25, D63, 183 and Q89.
[0147]           A "B20 series antibody" according to this invention is an anti-VEGF antibody that
is derived from a sequence of the B20 antibody or a B20-derived antibody according to any
one of Figures 27-29 of PCT Publication No. W02005/012359, the entire disclosure of
which is expressly incorporated herein by reference. See also PCT Publication No.
W02005/044853, and US Patent Application 60/991,302, the content of these patent
applications are expressly incorporated herein by reference. In one embodiment, the B20
series antibody binds to a functional epitope on human VEGF comprising residues F17, M18,
D19, Y21, Y25, Q89, 191, KI01, E103, and C104.
[0148]           A "functional epitope" according to this invention refers to amino acid residues of
an antigen that contribute energetically to the binding of an antibody. Mutation of any one of
the energetically contributing residues of the antigen (for example, mutation of wild-type
VEGF by alanine or homolog mutation) will disrupt the binding of the antibody such that the
relative affinity ratio (IC50mutant VEGF/IC50wild-type VEGF) of the antibody will be
                                                     47
9786917_1 (GHMatters) P98670.AU.1

greater than 5 (see Example 2 of W02005/012359). In one embodiment, the relative affinity
ratio is determined by a solution binding phage displaying ELISA. Briefly, 96-well
Maxisorp immunoplates (NUNC) are coated overnight at 4'C with an Fab form of the
antibody to be tested at a concentration of 2ug/ml in PBS, and blocked with PBS, 0.5% BSA,
and 0.05% Tween20 (PBT) for 2h at room temperature. Serial dilutions of phage displaying
hVEGF alanine point mutants (residues 8-109 form) or wild type hVEGF (8-109) in PBT are
first incubated on the Fab-coated plates for 15 min at room temperature, and the plates are
washed with PBS, 0.05% Tween20 (PBST). The bound phage is detected with an anti-M13
monoclonal antibody horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Pharmacia) conjugate diluted
 1:5000 in PBT, developed with 3,3' , 5,5'tetramethylbenzidine (TMB, Kirkegaard & Perry
Labs, Gaithersburg, MD) substrate for approximately 5 min, quenched with 1.0 M H3PO4,
and read spectrophotometrically at 450 nm. The ratio of IC50 values (IC50,ala/IC50,wt)
represents the fold of reduction in binding affinity (the relative binding affinity).
(iii)            VEGF receptor molecules
[0149]           The two best characterized VEGF receptors are VEGFR1 (also known as Flt-1) and
VEGFR2 (also known as KDR and FLK- 1 for the murine homolog). The specificity of each
receptor for each VEGF family member varies but VEGF-A binds to both Flt- 1 and KDR.
The full length Flt-1 receptor includes an extracellular domain that has seven Ig domains, a
transmembrane domain, and an intracellular domain with tyrosine kinase activity. The
extracellular domain is involved in the binding of VEGF and the intracellular domain is
involved in signal transduction.
[0150]           VEGF receptor molecules, or fragments thereof, that specifically bind to VEGF can
be used in the methods of the invention to bind to and sequester the VEGF protein, thereby
preventing it from signaling. In certain embodiments, the VEGF receptor molecule, or
VEGF binding fragment thereof, is a soluble form, such as sFlt-1. A soluble form of the
receptor exerts an inhibitory effect on the biological activity of the VEGF protein by binding
to VEGF, thereby preventing it from binding to its natural receptors present on the surface of
target cells. Also included are VEGF receptor fusion proteins, examples of which are
described below.
                                                   48
9786917_1 (GHMatters) P98670.AU.1

[0151]           A chimeric VEGF receptor protein is a receptor molecule having amino acid
sequences derived from at least two different proteins, at least one of which is a VEGF
receptor protein (e.g., the fit-i or KDR receptor), that is capable of binding to and inhibiting
the biological activity of VEGF. In certain embodiments, the chimeric VEGF receptor
proteins of the invention consist of amino acid sequences derived from only two different
VEGF receptor molecules; however, amino acid sequences comprising one, two, three, four,
five, six, or all seven Ig-like domains from the extracellular ligand-binding region of the fit-I
and/or KDR receptor can be linked to amino acid sequences from other unrelated proteins,
for example, immunoglobulin sequences. Other amino acid sequences to which Ig-like
domains are combined will be readily apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art. Examples
of chimeric VEGF receptor proteins include, e.g., soluble Flt-1/Fc, KDR/Fc, or FLt
 1/KDR/Fc (also known as VEGF Trap). (See for example PCT Application Publication No.
W097/44453)
[0152]           A soluble VEGF receptor protein or chimeric VEGF receptor proteins of the
invention includes VEGF receptor proteins which are not fixed to the surface of cells via a
transmembrane domain. As such, soluble forms of the VEGF receptor, including chimeric
receptor proteins, while capable of binding to and inactivating VEGF, do not comprise a
transmembrane domain and thus generally do not become associated with the cell membrane
of cells in which the molecule is expressed.
IV.              Kits
[0153]           In another aspect, provided is a kit comprising a PD-LI axis binding antagonist
and/or a VEGF antagonist for treating or delaying progression of a cancer in an individual or
for enhancing immune function of an individual having cancer. In some embodiments, the
kit comprises a PD-I axis binding antagonist and a package insert comprising instructions for
using the PD-I axis binding antagonist in combination with oxaliplatin, leucovorin, 5-FU
with or without a VEGF antagonist to treat or delay progression of cancer in an individual or

comprises oxaliplatin, leucovorin, 5-FU with or without a VEGF antagonist and a package
insert comprising instructions for using the oxaliplatin, leucovorin, 5-FU with or without a
VEGF antagonist in combination with a PD-I axis binding antagonist to treat or delay
progression of cancer in an individual or to enhance immune function of an individual having

cancer. In some embodiments, the kit comprises a PD-laxis binding antagonist and
oxaliplatin, leucovorin, 5-FU with or without a VEGF antagonist, and a package insert

leucovorin, 5-FU with or without a VEGF antagonist to treat or delay progression of cancer
in an individual or to enhance immune function of an individual having cancer. Any of the
PD-I axis binding antagonists and/or VEGF antagonists described herein may be included in
the kits.
                                                EXAMPLES
[0154]           The invention can be further understood by reference to the following examples,
which are provided by way of illustration and are not meant to be limiting.
Example 1: FOLFOX with or without anti-VEGF antibody enhanced anti-tumor
activity of anti-PD-Li
[0155]           To determine if FOLFOX (oxaliplatin, leucovorin and 5-fluorouracil) with or
without anti-VEGF antibody enhanced the anti-tumor activity of anti-PD-Li mouse models
of colorectal cancer were treated with the combination treatments. Briefly, female C57BL/6
mice were inoculated subcutaneously in the unilateral thoracic region with 100,000 MC38
murine colorectal cells in 100 microliters of HBSS:matrigel. When mice achieved a mean
tumor volume of 220 mm3 , they were randomly assigned to one of the treatment groups
outlined below, at experimental day 0. Treatment was initiated on experimental day 1. Mice
were weighed and tumors were measured 2-3 times per week for the duration of the study.
Experimental Groups:
       1) Control (isotype control antibody (anti-gpi20 antibody)), 10 mg/kg ip, 100
             microliters, administered three times a week for three weeks, n=10
      2)      anti-PD-LI antibody, 10 mg/kg ip, 100 microliters, administered three times a week
             for three weeks, n=10
       3)     FOLFOX (see below), administered once a week for two weeks, n=10
      4)      FOLFOX (see below), administered once a week for two weeks + anti-PD-Li
             antibody, 10 mg/kg ip, 100 microliters, administered three times a week for three
             weeks, n=10
                                                     50
9786917_1 (GHMatters) P98670.AU.1

       5)     FOLFOX (see below), administered once a week for two weeks + anti-VEGF
             antibody, 5 mg/kg ip, 100 microliters, administered two times a week for three weeks,
             n=10
       6)     FOLFOX (see below), administered once a week for two weeks + anti-VEGF
             antibody, 5 mg/kg ip, 100 uL, administered two times a week for three weeks + anti
             PD-Li antibody, 10 mg/kg ip, 100 microliters, administered three times a week for
             three weeks, n=10
ip   =  intraperitoneally
sc = subcutaneously
[0156]           For these studies, FOLFOX dosing was carried out as follows: on experimental day
 1 and experimental day 8, mice were administered oxaliplatin, 5 mg/kg ip in 50 microliters of
water immediately followed by leucovorin, 100 mg/kg ip in 250 microliters of water
(administered at time             = 0 hour) and 5-FU, 25 mg/kg ip immediately followed by 5-FU, 25
mg/kg sc (administered at time              = 2 hour). Anti-PD-LI antibody and anti-gp 120 antibody
were dosed on experimental days 1,3,5,8,10,12,15,17, and 19 (administered at time               =  4
hours). Anti-VEGF antibody was dosed on experimental day 1,4,8,11,15,18 (administered at
time= 6 hours).
[0157]           Mice were monitored for tumor growth and body weight changes. Tumor volumes
were measured using UltraCal-IV calipers (Model 54-10-111; Fred V. Fowler Company;
Newton, MA). The following formula was used to calculate tumor volume:
                 Tumor Volume (mm 3)         = (Length X Width 2 ) X 0.5
Length and width measurements were perpendicular to one another. Animal body weights
were measured using an Adventura Pro AV812 scale (Ohaus Corporation; Pine Brook, NJ).
Percent body weight change was calculated using the following formula:
                 Body weight change (%) = [(WeightDay        new - WeightDay 0)/WeightDay 0] X 100
[0158]           Data were analyzed using R, version 2.9.2 (R Development Core Team 2008;
R Foundation for Statistical Computing; Vienna, Austria), and the mixed models were fit
within R using the nlme package, version 3.1-96 (Pinheiro et al. 2009). Plotting was
performed in Prism, version 5.Ob for Mac (GraphPad Software, Inc.; La Jolla, CA).
[0159]           A mixed modeling approach was used to analyze the repeated measurement of
tumor volumes from the same animals over time (Pinheiro and Bates 2000). This approach
addresses both repeated measurements and modest dropouts before study end for reasons
classifiable statistically as missing at random (MAR). The fixed effect changes in
                                                         51
9786917_1 (GHMatters) P98670.AU.1

10g2(volume) by time and dose are modeled as the sum of the main effects and interaction of
a natural cubic regression spline basis in time with an auto-determined natural spline basis in
dose. Intercepts and growth rates (slopes) were assumed to vary randomly by animal.
Tumor growth inhibition as a percentage of the control-treated group (%TGI) was calculated
as the percentage of the area under the fitted curve (AUC) for the respective treatment group
per day in relation to the control while the control treated mice were still on study, using the
following formula:
                 %TGI = 100       x (1 - AUCose/AUCvehices)
 [0160]          For these studies, Complete Response (CR) was defined as an individual animal
whose tumor volume fell below the Limit of Detection (LOD), at any time during the study.
Partial Response (PR) was defined as an individual animal whose tumor volume decreased
by 50% of its initial tumor volume at any time during the study. Overall Response Rate
(ORR) was defined as the sum of the complete and partial responses. Time To Progression
5X (TTP5X) was defined as the time in days for a group' s fitted tumr volume (based upon
the mixed modeling analysis described above) to exceed 5 times the starting volume, rounded
to the nearest half day and reported as the TTP5X for that group. Linear mixed-effects
analysis was also employed to analyze the repeated measurement of body weight changes
from the same animals over time.
 [0161]          Blockade of the PD-i axis using anti-PD-Li antibody was effective as a single
agent therapy at preventing tumor growth. Combination treatment of anti-PD-Li antibodies
with oxaliplatin, leucovorin and 5-FU (FOLFOX) significantly inhibited tumor growth
indicating that this chemotherapy combination enhanced the anti-tumor activity of anti-PD
LI antibodies (Figure 1). Addition of anti-VEGF to this combination treatment further
enhanced this anti-tumor activity and as well as the durability of the anti-tumor response even
after the cessation of treatment (Figure 4).
