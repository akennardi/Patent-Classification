                                     Detailed Description
[0017]           In the following description of examples, reference is made to the
accompanying drawings which form a part hereof, and in which it is shown by way of
illustration specific examples that can be practiced. It is to be understood that other
examples can be used and structural changes can be made without departing from the
scope of the disclosed examples.
                                  EXEMPLARY DEVICES
[0018]           Embodiments of electronic devices, user interfaces for such devices, and
associated processes for using such devices are described. In some embodiments, the
device is a portable communications device, such as a mobile telephone, that also
contains other functions, such as PDA and/or music player functions. Exemplary
embodiments of portable multifunction devices include, without limitation, the iPhone@,
iPod Touch@, and iPad@ devices from Apple Inc. of Cupertino, California. Other
portable electronic devices, such as laptops or tablet computers with touch-sensitive
surfaces (e.g., touch screen displays and/or touch pads), are, optionally, used. It should
also be understood that, in some embodiments, the device is not a portable
communications device, but is a desktop computer or a television with a touch-sensitive
surface (e.g., a touch screen display and/or a touch pad). In some embodiments, the
device does not have a touch screen display and/or a touch pad, but rather is capable of
outputting display information (such as the user interfaces of the disclosure) for display
on a separate display device, and capable of receiving input information from a separate
input device having one or more input mechanisms (such as one or more buttons, a touch
screen display and/or a touch pad). In some embodiments, the device has a display, but is
capable of receiving input information from a separate input device having one or more
input mechanisms (such as one or more buttons, a touch screen display and/or a touch
pad).
[0019]           In the discussion that follows, an electronic device that includes a display
and a touch-sensitive surface is described. It should be understood, however, that the
electronic device optionally includes one or more other physical user-interface devices,
such as a physical keyboard, a mouse and/or a joystick. Further, as described above, it
should be understood that the described electronic device, display and touch-sensitive
                                               -3-

WO 2015/200371                                                            PCT/US2015/037260
surface are optionally distributed amongst two or more devices. Therefore, as used in this
disclosure, information displayed on the electronic device or by the electronic device is
optionally used to describe information outputted by the electronic device for display on a
separate display device (touch-sensitive or not). Similarly, as used in this disclosure,
input received on the electronic device (e.g., touch input received on a touch-sensitive
surface of the electronic device) is optionally used to describe input received on a
separate input device, from which the electronic device receives input information.
[0020]           The device typically supports a variety of applications, such as one or
more of the following: a drawing application, a presentation application, a word
processing application, a website creation application, a disk authoring application, a
spreadsheet application, a gaming application, a telephone application, a video
conferencing application, an e-mail application, an instant messaging application, a
workout support application, a photo management application, a digital camera
application, a digital video camera application, a web browsing application, a digital
music player application, a television channel browsing application, and/or a digital video
player application.
[0021]           The various applications that are executed on the device optionally use at
least one common physical user-interface device, such as the touch-sensitive surface.
One or more functions of the touch-sensitive surface as well as corresponding information
displayed on the device are, optionally, adjusted and/or varied from one application to the
next and/or within a respective application. In this way, a common physical architecture
(such as the touch-sensitive surface) of the device optionally supports the variety of
applications with user interfaces that are intuitive and transparent to the user.
[0022]           Attention is now directed toward embodiments of portable or non-portable
devices with touch-sensitive displays, though the devices need not include touch-sensitive
displays or displays in general, as described above. Fig. 1A is a block diagram
illustrating portable or non-portable multifunction device 100 with touch-sensitive
displays 112 in accordance with some embodiments. Touch-sensitive display 112 is
sometimes called a "touch screen" for convenience, and is sometimes known as or called
a touch-sensitive display system. Device 100 includes memory 102 (which optionally
includes one or more computer readable storage mediums), memory controller 122, one
or more processing units (CPU's) 120, peripherals interface 118, RF circuitry 108, audio
                                              -4-

WO 2015/200371                                                             PCT/US2015/037260
circuitry 110, speaker 111, microphone 113, input/output (1/0) subsystem 106, other
input or control devices 116, and external port 124. Device 100 optionally includes one
or more optical sensors 164. Device 100 optionally includes one or more intensity
sensors 165 for detecting intensity of contacts on device 100 (e.g., a touch-sensitive
surface such as touch-sensitive display system 112 of device 100). Device 100 optionally
includes one or more tactile output generators 167 for generating tactile outputs on device
100 (e.g., generating tactile outputs on a touch-sensitive surface such as touch-sensitive
display system 112 of device 100 or touchpad 355 of device 300). These components
optionally communicate over one or more communication buses or signal lines 103.
[0023]           As used in the specification and claims, the term "intensity" of a contact
on a touch-sensitive surface refers to the force or pressure (force per unit area) of a
contact (e.g., a finger contact) on the touch-sensitive surface, or to a substitute (proxy) for
the force or pressure of a contact on the touch-sensitive surface. The intensity of a
contact has a range of values that includes at least four distinct values and more typically
includes hundreds of distinct values (e.g., at least 256). Intensity of a contact is,
optionally, determined (or measured) using various approaches and various sensors or
combinations of sensors. For example, one or more force sensors underneath or adjacent
to the touch-sensitive surface are, optionally, used to measure force at various points on
the touch-sensitive surface. In some implementations, force measurements from multiple
force sensors are combined (e.g., a weighted average) to determine an estimated force of
a contact. Similarly, a pressure-sensitive tip of a stylus is, optionally, used to determine a
pressure of the stylus on the touch-sensitive surface. Alternatively, the size of the contact
area detected on the touch-sensitive surface and/or changes thereto, the capacitance of the
touch-sensitive surface proximate to the contact and/or changes thereto, and/or the
resistance of the touch-sensitive surface proximate to the contact and/or changes thereto
are, optionally, used as a substitute for the force or pressure of the contact on the touch
sensitive surface. In some implementations, the substitute measurements for contact
force or pressure are used directly to determine whether an intensity threshold has been
exceeded (e.g., the intensity threshold is described in units corresponding to the substitute
measurements). In some implementations, the substitute measurements for contact force
or pressure are converted to an estimated force or pressure and the estimated force or
                                               -5-

WO 2015/200371                                                             PCT/US2015/037260
pressure is used to determine whether an intensity threshold has been exceeded (e.g., the
intensity threshold is a pressure threshold measured in units of pressure).
[0024]          As used in the specification and claims, the term "tactile output" refers to
physical displacement of a device relative to a previous position of the device, physical
displacement of a component (e.g., a touch-sensitive surface) of a device relative to
another component (e.g., housing) of the device, or displacement of the component
relative to a center of mass of the device that will be detected by a user with the user's
sense of touch. For example, in situations where the device or the component of the
device is in contact with a surface of a user that is sensitive to touch (e.g., a finger, palm,
or other part of a user's hand), the tactile output generated by the physical displacement
will be interpreted by the user as a tactile sensation corresponding to a perceived change
in physical characteristics of the device or the component of the device. For example,
movement of a touch-sensitive surface (e.g., a touch-sensitive display or trackpad) is,
optionally, interpreted by the user as a "down click" or "up click" of a physical actuator
button. In some cases, a user will feel a tactile sensation such as an "down click" or "up
click" even when there is no movement of a physical actuator button associated with the
touch-sensitive surface that is physically pressed (e.g., displaced) by the user's
movements. As another example, movement of the touch-sensitive surface is, optionally,
interpreted or sensed by the user as "roughness" of the touch-sensitive surface, even when
there is no change in smoothness of the touch-sensitive surface. While such
interpretations of touch by a user will be subject to the individualized sensory perceptions
of the user, there are many sensory perceptions of touch that are common to a large
majority of users. Thus, when a tactile output is described as corresponding to a
particular sensory perception of a user (e.g., an "up click," a "down click," "roughness"),
unless otherwise stated, the generated tactile output corresponds to physical displacement
of the device or a component thereof that will generate the described sensory perception
for a typical (or average) user.
[0025]          It should be appreciated that device 100 is only one example of a portable
or non-portable multifunction device, and that device 100 optionally has more or fewer
components than shown, optionally combines two or more components, or optionally has
a different configuration or arrangement of the components. The various components
shown in Fig. 1A are implemented in hardware, software, or a combination of both
                                               -6-

hardware and software, including one or more signal processing and/or application
specific integrated circuits. Further, the various components shown in Fig. 1A are
optionally implemented across two or more devices; for example, a display and audio
circuitry on a display device, a touch-sensitive surface on an input device, and remaining
components on device 100. In such an embodiment, device 100 optionally communicates
with the display device and/or the input device to facilitate operation of the system, as
described in the disclosure, and the various components described herein that relate to
display and/or input remain in device 100, or are optionally included in the display and/or
input device, as appropriate.
[0026]           Memory 102 optionally includes high-speed random access memory and
optionally also includes non-volatile memory, such as one or more magnetic disk storage
devices, flash memory devices, or other non-volatile solid-state memory devices. Access
to memory 102 by other components of device 100, such as CPU 120 and the peripherals
interface 118, is, optionally, controlled by memory controller 122.
[0027]           Peripherals interface 118 can be used to couple input and output
peripherals of the device to CPU 120 and memory 102. The one or more processors 120
run or execute various software programs and/or sets of instructions stored in memory
102 to perform various functions for device 100 and to process data.
[0028]           In some embodiments, peripherals interface 118, CPU 120, and memory
controller 122 are, optionally, implemented on a single chip, such as chip 104. In some
other embodiments, they are, optionally, implemented on separate chips.
[0029]           RF (radio frequency) circuitry 108 receives and sends RF signals, also
called electromagnetic signals. RF circuitry 108 converts electrical signals to/from
electromagnetic signals and communicates with communications networks and other
communications devices via the electromagnetic signals. RF circuitry 108 optionally
includes well-known circuitry for performing these functions, including but not limited to
an antenna system, an RF transceiver, one or more amplifiers, a tuner, one or more
oscillators, a digital signal processor, a CODEC chipset, a subscriber identity module
(SIM) card, memory, and so forth. RF circuitry 108 optionally communicates with
networks, such as the Internet, also referred to as the World Wide Web (WWW), an
intranet and/or a wireless network, such as a cellular telephone network, a wireless local

[0030]          Audio circuitry 110, speaker 111, and microphone 113 provide an audio
interface between a user and device 100. Audio circuitry 110 receives audio data from
peripherals interface 118, converts the audio data to an electrical signal, and transmits the
electrical signal to speaker 111. Speaker 11I converts the electrical signal to human
audible sound waves. Audio circuitry 110 also receives electrical signals converted by
microphone 113 from sound waves. Audio circuitry 110 converts the electrical signal to
audio data and transmits the audio data to peripherals interface 118 for processing. Audio
data is, optionally, retrieved from and/or transmitted to memory 102 and/or RF circuitry
108 by peripherals interface 118. In some embodiments, audio circuitry 110 also includes
a headset jack (e.g., 212, Fig. 2). The headset jack provides an interface between audio
circuitry 110 and removable audio input/output peripherals, such as output-only
headphones or a headset with both output (e.g., a headphone for one or both ears) and
input (e.g., a microphone).
[0031]          1/0 subsystem 106 couples input/output peripherals on device 100, such as

subsystem 106 optionally includes display controller 156, optical sensor controller 158,
intensity sensor controller 159, haptic feedback controller 161 and one or more input
controllers 160 for other input or control devices. The one or more input controllers 160
receive/send electrical signals from/to other input or control devices 116. The other input
control devices 116 optionally include physical buttons (e.g., push buttons, rocker
buttons, etc.), dials, slider switches, joysticks, click wheels, and so forth. In some
alternate embodiments, input controller(s) 160 are, optionally, coupled to any (or none) of
the following: a keyboard, infrared port, USB port, and a pointer device such as a mouse.
The one or more buttons (e.g., 208, Fig. 2) optionally include an up/down button for
volume control of speaker 111 and/or microphone 113. The one or more buttons
optionally include a push button (e.g., 206, Fig. 2).
[0032]           Touch-sensitive display 112 provides an input interface and an output
interface between the device and a user. As described above, the touch-sensitive
operation and the display operation of touch-sensitive display 112 are optionally
separated from each other, such that a display device is used for display purposes and a
touch-sensitive surface (whether display or not) is used for input detection purposes, and
the described components and functions are modified accordingly. However, for
simplicity, the following description is provided with reference to a touch-sensitive
display. Display controller 156 receives and/or sends electrical signals from/to touch
screen 112. Touch screen 112 displays visual output to the user. The visual output
optionally includes graphics, text, icons, video, and any combination thereof (collectively
termed "graphics"). In some embodiments, some or all of the visual output corresponds
to user-interface objects.
[0033]           Touch screen 112 has a touch-sensitive surface, sensor or set of sensors
that accepts input from the user based on haptic and/or tactile contact. Touch screen 112
and display controller 156 (along with any associated modules and/or sets of instructions
in memory 102) detect contact (and any movement or breaking of the contact) on touch
screen 112 and converts the detected contact into interaction with user-interface objects
(e.g., one or more soft keys, icons, web pages or images) that are displayed on touch
screen 112. In an exemplary embodiment, a point of contact between touch screen 112
and the user corresponds to a finger of the user.

[0034]          Touch screen 112 optionally uses LCD (liquid crystal display) technology,
LPD (light emitting polymer display) technology, or LED (light emitting diode)
technology, although other display technologies are used in other embodiments. Touch
screen 112 and display controller 156 optionally detect contact and any movement or
breaking thereof using any of a plurality of touch sensing technologies now known or
later developed, including but not limited to capacitive, resistive, infrared, and surface
acoustic wave technologies, as well as other proximity sensor arrays or other elements for
determining one or more points of contact with touch screen 112. In an exemplary
embodiment, projected mutual capacitance sensing technology is used, such as that found
in the iPhone@, iPod Touch@, and iPad@ from Apple Inc. of Cupertino, California.
[0035]          Touch screen 112 optionally has a video resolution in excess of 100 dpi.
In some embodiments, the touch screen has a video resolution of approximately 160 dpi.
The user optionally makes contact with touch screen 112 using any suitable object or
appendage, such as a stylus, a finger, and so forth. In some embodiments, the user
interface is designed to work primarily with finger-based contacts and gestures, which
can be less precise than stylus-based input due to the larger area of contact of a finger on
the touch screen. In some embodiments, the device translates the rough finger-based
input into a precise pointer/cursor position or command for performing the actions desired
by the user.
[0036]          In some embodiments, in addition to the touch screen, device 100
optionally includes a touchpad (not shown) for activating or deactivating particular
functions. In some embodiments, the touchpad is a touch-sensitive area of the device
that, unlike the touch screen, does not display visual output. The touchpad is, optionally,
a touch-sensitive surface that is separate from touch screen 112 or an extension of the
touch-sensitive surface formed by the touch screen.
[0037]          Device 100 also includes power system 162 for powering the various
components. Power system 162 optionally includes a power management system, one or
more power sources (e.g., battery, alternating current (AC)), a recharging system, a power
failure detection circuit, a power converter or inverter, a power status indicator (e.g., a
light-emitting diode (LED)) and any other components associated with the generation,
management and distribution of power in portable or non-portable devices.

[0038]           Device 100 optionally also includes one or more optical sensors 164.
Fig. 1A shows an optical sensor coupled to optical sensor controller 158 in I/O subsystem
106. Optical sensor 164 optionally includes charge-coupled device (CCD) or
complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) phototransistors. Optical sensor 164
receives light from the environment, projected through one or more lens, and converts the
light to data representing an image. In conjunction with imaging module 143 (also called
a camera module), optical sensor 164 optionally captures still images or video. In some
embodiments, an optical sensor is located on the back of device 100, opposite touch
screen display 112 on the front of the device, so that the touch screen display is enabled
for use as a viewfinder for still and/or video image acquisition. In some embodiments,
another optical sensor is located on the front of the device so that the user's image is,
optionally, obtained for videoconferencing while the user views the other video
conference participants on the touch screen display.
[0039]           Device 100 optionally also includes one or more contact intensity sensors
165. Fig. 1A shows a contact intensity sensor coupled to intensity sensor controller 159
in 1/0 subsystem 106. Contact intensity sensor 165 optionally includes one or more
piezoresistive strain gauges, capacitive force sensors, electric force sensors, piezoelectric
force sensors, optical force sensors, capacitive touch-sensitive surfaces, or other intensity
sensors (e.g., sensors used to measure the force (or pressure) of a contact on a touch
sensitive surface). Contact intensity sensor 165 receives contact intensity information
(e.g., pressure information or a proxy for pressure information) from the environment. In
some embodiments, at least one contact intensity sensor is collocated with, or proximate
to, a touch-sensitive surface (e.g., touch-sensitive display system 112). In some
embodiments, at least one contact intensity sensor is located on the back of device 100,
opposite touch screen display 112 which is located on the front of device 100.
[0040]           Device 100 optionally also includes one or more proximity sensors 166.
Fig. 1A shows proximity sensor 166 coupled to peripherals interface 118. Alternately,
proximity sensor 166 is coupled to input controller 160 in 1/0 subsystem 106. In some
embodiments, the proximity sensor turns off and disables touch screen 112 when the
multifunction device is placed near the user's ear (e.g., when the user is making a phone
call).

[0041]           Device 100 optionally also includes one or more tactile output generators
167. Fig. 1A shows a tactile output generator coupled to haptic feedback controller 161
in 1/0 subsystem 106. Tactile output generator 167 optionally includes one or more
electroacoustic devices such as speakers or other audio components and/or
electromechanical devices that convert energy into linear motion such as a motor,
solenoid, electroactive polymer, piezoelectric actuator, electrostatic actuator, or other
tactile output generating component (e.g., a component that converts electrical signals
into tactile outputs on the device). Contact intensity sensor 165 receives tactile feedback
generation instructions from haptic feedback module 133 and generates tactile outputs on
device 100 that are capable of being sensed by a user of device 100. In some
embodiments, at least one tactile output generator is collocated with, or proximate to, a
touch-sensitive surface (e.g., touch-sensitive display system 112) and, optionally,
generates a tactile output by moving the touch-sensitive surface vertically (e.g., in/out of a
surface of device 100) or laterally (e.g., back and forth in the same plane as a surface of
device 100). In some embodiments, at least one tactile output generator sensor is located
on the back of device 100, opposite touch screen display 112 which is located on the front
of device 100.
[0042]           Device 100 optionally also includes one or more accelerometers 168. Fig.
1A shows accelerometer 168 coupled to peripherals interface 118. Alternately,
accelerometer 168 is, optionally, coupled to an input controller 160 in 1/0 subsystem 106.
In some embodiments, information is displayed on the touch screen display in a portrait
view or a landscape view based on an analysis of data received from the one or more
accelerometers. Device 100 optionally includes, in addition to accelerometer(s) 168, a
magnetometer (not shown) and a GPS (or GLONASS or other global navigation system)
receiver (not shown) for obtaining information concerning the location and orientation
(e.g., portrait or landscape) of device 100.
[0043]           In some embodiments, the software components stored in memory 102
include operating system 126, communication module (or set of instructions) 128,
contact/motion module (or set of instructions) 130, graphics module (or set of
instructions) 132, text input module (or set of instructions) 134, Global Positioning
System (GPS) module (or set of instructions) 135, and applications (or sets of
instructions) 136. Furthermore, in some embodiments memory 102 stores device/global

internal state 157, as shown in Figs. 1A and 3. Device/global internal state 157 includes
one or more of: active application state, indicating which applications, if any, are
currently active; display state, indicating what applications, views or other information
occupy various regions of touch screen display 112; sensor state, including information
obtained from the device's various sensors and input control devices 116; and location
information concerning the device's location and/or attitude.
[0044]          Operating system 126 (e.g., Darwin, RTXC, LINUX, UNIX, OS X,
WINDOWS, or an embedded operating system such as VxWorks) includes various
software components and/or drivers for controlling and managing general system tasks
(e.g., memory management, storage device control, power management, etc.) and
facilitates communication between various hardware and software components.
[0045]          Communication module 128 facilitates communication with other devices
over one or more external ports 124 and also includes various software components for
handling data received by RF circuitry 108 and/or external port 124. External port 124
(e.g., Universal Serial Bus (USB), FIREWIRE, etc.) is adapted for coupling directly to
other devices or indirectly over a network (e.g., the Internet, wireless LAN, etc.). In some
embodiments, the external port is a multi-pin (e.g., 30-pin) connector that is the same as,
or similar to and/or compatible with the 30-pin connector used on iPod (trademark of
Apple Inc.) devices.
[0046]          Contact/motion module 130 optionally detects contact with touch screen
112 (in conjunction with display controller 156) and other touch-sensitive devices (e.g., a
touchpad or physical click wheel). Contact/motion module 130 includes various software
components for performing various operations related to detection of contact, such as
determining if contact has occurred (e.g., detecting a finger-down event), determining an
intensity of the contact (e.g., the force or pressure of the contact or a substitute for the
force or pressure of the contact) determining if there is movement of the contact and
tracking the movement across the touch-sensitive surface (e.g., detecting one or more
finger-dragging events), and determining if the contact has ceased (e.g., detecting a
finger-up event or a break in contact). Contact/motion module 130 receives contact data
from the touch-sensitive surface. Determining movement of the point of contact, which is
represented by a series of contact data, optionally includes determining speed
(magnitude), velocity (magnitude and direction), and/or an acceleration (a change in
                                               -13-

WO 2015/200371                                                            PCT/US2015/037260
magnitude and/or direction) of the point of contact. These operations are, optionally,
applied to single contacts (e.g., one finger contacts) or to multiple simultaneous contacts
(e.g., "multitouch"/multiple finger contacts). In some embodiments, contact/motion
module 130 and display controller 156 detect contact on a touchpad.
[0047]          In some embodiments, contact/motion module 130 uses a set of one or
more intensity thresholds to determine whether an operation has been performed by a user
(e.g., to determine whether a user has "clicked" on an icon). In some embodiments at
least a subset of the intensity thresholds are determined in accordance with software
parameters (e.g., the intensity thresholds are not determined by the activation thresholds
of particular physical actuators and can be adjusted without changing the physical
hardware of device 100). For example, a mouse "click" threshold of a trackpad or touch
screen display can be set to any of a large range of predefined thresholds values without
changing the trackpad or touch screen display hardware. Additionally, in some
implementations a user of the device is provided with software settings for adjusting one
or more of the set of intensity thresholds (e.g., by adjusting individual intensity thresholds
and/or by adjusting a plurality of intensity thresholds at once with a system-level click
"intensity" parameter).
[0048]          Contact/motion module 130 optionally detects a gesture input by a user.
Different gestures on the touch-sensitive surface have different contact patterns and
intensities. Thus, a gesture is, optionally, detected by detecting a particular contact
pattern. For example, detecting a finger tap gesture includes detecting a finger-down
event followed by detecting a finger-up (lift off) event at the same position (or
substantially the same position) as the finger-down event (e.g., at the position of an icon).
As another example, detecting a finger swipe gesture on the touch-sensitive surface
includes detecting a finger-down event followed by detecting one or more finger
dragging events, and subsequently followed by detecting a finger-up (lift off) event.
[0049]          Graphics module 132 includes various known software components for
rendering and displaying graphics on touch screen 112 or other display, including
components for changing the visual impact (e.g., brightness, transparency, saturation,
contrast or other visual property) of graphics that are displayed. As used herein, the term
"graphics" includes any object that can be displayed to a user, including without
                                              -14-

digital images, videos, animations and the like.
[0050]           In some embodiments, graphics module 132 stores data representing
graphics to be used. Each graphic is, optionally, assigned a corresponding code.
Graphics module 132 receives, from applications etc., one or more codes specifying
graphics to be displayed along with, if necessary, coordinate data and other graphic
property data, and then generates screen image data to output to display controller 156.
[0051]           Haptic feedback module 133 includes various software components for
generating instructions used by tactile output generator(s) 167 to produce tactile outputs
at one or more locations on device 100 in response to user interactions with device 100.

module 132, provides soft keyboards for entering text in various applications (e.g.,
contacts 137, e-mail 140, IM 141, browser 147, and any other application that needs text
input).
[0053]           GPS module 135 determines the location of the device and provides this
information for use in various applications (e.g., to telephone 138 for use in location
based dialing, to camera 143 as picture/video metadata, and to applications that provide
location-based services such as weather widgets, local yellow page widgets, and
map/navigation widgets).

external, connected display via external port 124), send an e-mail with a link to a
particular online video, and otherwise manage online videos in one or more file formats,
such as H.264. In some embodiments, instant messaging module 141, rather than e-mail
client module 140, is used to send a link to a particular online video.
[0073]          Each of the above identified modules and applications correspond to a set
of executable instructions for performing one or more functions described above and the
methods described in this application (e.g., the computer-implemented methods and other
information processing methods described herein). These modules (i.e., sets of
instructions) need not be implemented as separate software programs, procedures or
modules, and thus various subsets of these modules are, optionally, combined or
otherwise re-arranged in various embodiments. In some embodiments, memory 102
optionally stores a subset of the modules and data structures identified above.
Furthermore, memory 102 optionally stores additional modules and data structures not
described above.
[0074]          In some embodiments, device 100 is a device where operation of a
predefined set of functions on the device is performed exclusively through a touch screen
and/or a touchpad (whether included in device 100 or on a separate device, such as an
input device). By using a touch screen and/or a touchpad as the primary input control
device for operation of device 100, the number of physical input control devices (such as
push buttons, dials, and the like) on device 100 is, optionally, reduced.
[0075]          The predefined set of functions that are performed exclusively through a
touch screen and/or a touchpad optionally include navigation between user interfaces. In
some embodiments, the touchpad, when touched by the user, navigates device 100 to a

WO 2015/200371                                                           PCT/US2015/037260
main, home, or root menu from any user interface that is displayed on device 100. In
such embodiments, a "menu button" is implemented using a touchpad. In some other
embodiments, the menu button is a physical push button or other physical input control
device instead of a touchpad.
[0076]          Fig. lB is a block diagram illustrating exemplary components for event
handling in accordance with some embodiments. In some embodiments, memory 102 (in
Fig. 1A) or 370 (Fig. 3) includes event sorter 170 (e.g., in operating system 126) and a
respective application 136-1 (e.g., any of the aforementioned applications 137-151, 155,
380-390).
[0077]          Event sorter 170 receives event information and determines the application
136-1 and application view 191 of application 136-1 to which to deliver the event
information. Event sorter 170 includes event monitor 171 and event dispatcher module
174. In some embodiments, application 136-1 includes application internal state 192,
which indicates the current application view(s) displayed on touch-sensitive display 112
when the application is active or executing. In some embodiments, device/global internal
state 157 is used by event sorter 170 to determine which application(s) is (are) currently
active, and application internal state 192 is used by event sorter 170 to determine
application views 191 to which to deliver event information.
[0078]          In some embodiments, application internal state 192 includes additional
information, such as one or more of: resume information to be used when application
136-1 resumes execution, user interface state information that indicates information being
displayed or that is ready for display by application 136-1, a state queue for enabling the
user to go back to a prior state or view of application 136-1, and a redo/undo queue of
previous actions taken by the user.
[0079]          Event monitor 171 receives event information from peripherals interface
118. Event information includes information about a sub-event (e.g., a user touch on
touch-sensitive display 112, as part of a multi-touch gesture). Peripherals interface 118
transmits information it receives from 1/0 subsystem 106 or a sensor, such as proximity
sensor 166, accelerometer(s) 168, and/or microphone 113 (through audio circuitry 110).
Information that peripherals interface 118 receives from 1/0 subsystem 106 includes
information from touch-sensitive display 112 or a touch-sensitive surface.

WO 2015/200371                                                            PCT/US2015/037260
[0080]          In some embodiments, event monitor 171 sends requests to the peripherals
interface 118 at predetermined intervals. In response, peripherals interface 118 transmits
event information. In other embodiments, peripheral interface 118 transmits event
information only when there is a significant event (e.g., receiving an input above a
predetermined noise threshold and/or for more than a predetermined duration).
[0081]          In some embodiments, event sorter 170 also includes a hit view
determination module 172 and/or an active event recognizer determination module 173.
[0082]          Hit view determination module 172 provides software procedures for
determining where a sub-event has taken place within one or more views, when touch
sensitive display 112 displays more than one view. Views are made up of controls and
other elements that a user can see on the display.
[0083]          Another aspect of the user interface associated with an application is a set
of views, sometimes herein called application views or user interface windows, in which
information is displayed and touch-based gestures occur. The application views (of a
respective application) in which a touch is detected optionally correspond to
programmatic levels within a programmatic or view hierarchy of the application. For
example, the lowest level view in which a touch is detected is, optionally, called the hit
view, and the set of events that are recognized as proper inputs are, optionally,
determined based, at least in part, on the hit view of the initial touch that begins a touch
based gesture.
[0084]          Hit view determination module 172 receives information related to
sub-events of a touch-based gesture. When an application has multiple views organized
in a hierarchy, hit view determination module 172 identifies a hit view as the lowest view
in the hierarchy which should handle the sub-event. In most circumstances, the hit view
is the lowest level view in which an initiating sub-event occurs (i.e., the first sub-event in
the sequence of sub-events that form an event or potential event). Once the hit view is
identified by the hit view determination module, the hit view typically receives all sub
events related to the same touch or input source for which it was identified as the hit
view.
[0085]          Active event recognizer determination module 173 determines which view
or views within a view hierarchy should receive a particular sequence of sub-events. In
                                              -22-

WO 2015/200371                                                          PCT/US2015/037260
some embodiments, active event recognizer determination module 173 determines that
only the hit view should receive a particular sequence of sub-events. In other
embodiments, active event recognizer determination module 173 determines that all
views that include the physical location of a sub-event are actively involved views, and
therefore determines that all actively involved views should receive a particular sequence
of sub-events. In other embodiments, even if touch sub-events were entirely confined to
the area associated with one particular view, views higher in the hierarchy would still
remain as actively involved views.
[0086]          Event dispatcher module 174 dispatches the event information to an event
recognizer (e.g., event recognizer 180). In embodiments including active event
recognizer determination module 173, event dispatcher module 174 delivers the event
information to an event recognizer determined by active event recognizer determination
module 173. In some embodiments, event dispatcher module 174 stores in an event
queue the event information, which is retrieved by a respective event receiver module
182.
[0087]          In some embodiments, operating system 126 includes event sorter 170.
Alternatively, application 136-1 includes event sorter 170. In yet other embodiments,
event sorter 170 is a stand-alone module, or a part of another module stored in memory
102, such as contact/motion module 130.
[0088]          In some embodiments, application 136-1 includes a plurality of event
handlers 190 and one or more application views 191, each of which includes instructions
for handling touch events that occur within a respective view of the application's user
interface. Each application view 191 of the application 136-1 includes one or more event
recognizers 180. Typically, a respective application view 191 includes a plurality of
event recognizers 180. In other embodiments, one or more of event recognizers 180 are
part of a separate module, such as a user interface kit (not shown) or a higher level object
from which application 136-1 inherits methods and other properties. In some
embodiments, a respective event handler 190 includes one or more of: data updater 176,
object updater 177, GUI updater 178, and/or event data 179 received from event sorter
170. Event handler 190 optionally utilizes or calls data updater 176, object updater 177
or GUI updater 178 to update the application internal state 192. Alternatively, one or
more of the application views 191 includes one or more respective event handlers 190.
                                             -23-

WO 2015/200371                                                            PCT/US2015/037260
Also, in some embodiments, one or more of data updater 176, object updater 177, and
GUI updater 178 are included in a respective application view 191.
[0089]           A respective event recognizer 180 receives event information (e.g., event
data 179) from event sorter 170, and identifies an event from the event information.
Event recognizer 180 includes event receiver 182 and event comparator 184. In some
embodiments, event recognizer 180 also includes at least a subset of: metadata 183, and
event delivery instructions 188 (which optionally include sub-event delivery instructions).
[0090]           Event receiver 182 receives event information from event sorter 170. The
event information includes information about a sub-event, for example, a touch or a touch
movement. Depending on the sub-event, the event information also includes additional
information, such as location of the sub-event. When the sub-event concerns motion of a
touch, the event information optionally also includes speed and direction of the sub-event.
In some embodiments, events include rotation of the device from one orientation to
another (e.g., from a portrait orientation to a landscape orientation, or vice versa), and the
event information includes corresponding information about the current orientation (also
called device attitude) of the device.
[0091]           Event comparator 184 compares the event information to predefined event
or sub-event definitions and, based on the comparison, determines an event or sub-event,
or determines or updates the state of an event or sub-event. In some embodiments, event
comparator 184 includes event definitions 186. Event definitions 186 contain definitions
of events (e.g., predefined sequences of sub-events), for example, event 1 (187-1), event 2
(187-2), and others. In some embodiments, sub-events in an event 187 include, for
example, touch begin, touch end, touch movement, touch cancellation, and multiple
touching. In one example, the definition for event 1 (187-1) is a double tap on a
displayed object. The double tap, for example, comprises a first touch (touch begin) on
the displayed object for a predetermined phase, a first lift-off (touch end) for a
predetermined phase, a second touch (touch begin) on the displayed object for a
predetermined phase, and a second lift-off (touch end) for a predetermined phase. In
another example, the definition for event 2 (187-2) is a dragging on a displayed object.
The dragging, for example, comprises a touch (or contact) on the displayed object for a
predetermined phase, a movement of the touch across touch-sensitive display 112, and
                                              -24-

WO 2015/200371                                                           PCT/US2015/037260
lift-off of the touch (touch end). In some embodiments, the event also includes
information for one or more associated event handlers 190.
[0092]            In some embodiments, event definition 187 includes a definition of an
event for a respective user-interface object. In some embodiments, event comparator 184
performs a hit test to determine which user-interface object is associated with a sub-event.
For example, in an application view in which three user-interface objects are displayed on
touch-sensitive display 112, when a touch is detected on touch-sensitive display 112,
event comparator 184 performs a hit test to determine which of the three user-interface
objects is associated with the touch (sub-event). If each displayed object is associated
with a respective event handler 190, the event comparator uses the result of the hit test to
determine which event handler 190 should be activated. For example, event comparator
184 selects an event handler associated with the sub-event and the object triggering the hit
test.
[0093]            In some embodiments, the definition for a respective event 187 also
includes delayed actions that delay delivery of the event information until after it has been
determined whether the sequence of sub-events does or does not correspond to the event
recognizer's event type.
[0094]            When a respective event recognizer 180 determines that the series of sub
events do not match any of the events in event definitions 186, the respective event
recognizer 180 enters an event impossible, event failed, or event ended state, after which
it disregards subsequent sub-events of the touch-based gesture. In this situation, other
event recognizers, if any, that remain active for the hit view continue to track and process
sub-events of an ongoing touch-based gesture.
[0095]            In some embodiments, a respective event recognizer 180 includes
metadata 183 with configurable properties, flags, and/or lists that indicate how the event
delivery system should perform sub-event delivery to actively involved event recognizers.
In some embodiments, metadata 183 includes configurable properties, flags, and/or lists
that indicate how event recognizers interact, or are enabled to interact, with one another.
In some embodiments, metadata 183 includes configurable properties, flags, and/or lists
that indicate whether sub-events are delivered to varying levels in the view or
programmatic hierarchy.

WO 2015/200371                                                          PCT/US2015/037260
[0096]          In some embodiments, a respective event recognizer 180 activates event
handler 190 associated with an event when one or more particular sub-events of an event
are recognized. In some embodiments, a respective event recognizer 180 delivers event
information associated with the event to event handler 190. Activating an event handler
190 is distinct from sending (and deferred sending) sub-events to a respective hit view. In
some embodiments, event recognizer 180 throws a flag associated with the recognized
event, and event handler 190 associated with the flag catches the flag and performs a
predefined process.
[0097]          In some embodiments, event delivery instructions 188 include sub-event
delivery instructions that deliver event information about a sub-event without activating
an event handler. Instead, the sub-event delivery instructions deliver event information to
event handlers associated with the series of sub-events or to actively involved views.
Event handlers associated with the series of sub-events or with actively involved views
receive the event information and perform a predetermined process.
[0098]          In some embodiments, data updater 176 creates and updates data used in
application 136-1. For example, data updater 176 updates the telephone number used in
contacts module 137, or stores a video file used in video player module 145. In some
embodiments, object updater 177 creates and updates objects used in application 136-1.
For example, object updater 176 creates a new user-interface object or updates the
position of a user-interface object. GUI updater 178 updates the GUI. For example, GUI
updater 178 prepares display information and sends it to graphics module 132 for display
on a touch-sensitive display.
[0099]          In some embodiments, event handler(s) 190 includes or has access to data
updater 176, object updater 177, and GUI updater 178. In some embodiments, data
updater 176, object updater 177, and GUI updater 178 are included in a single module of
a respective application 136-1 or application view 191. In other embodiments, they are
included in two or more software modules.
[00100]         It shall be understood that the foregoing discussion regarding event
handling of user touches on touch-sensitive displays and/or touchpads also applies to
other forms of user inputs to operate multifunction devices 100 with input-devices, not all
of which are initiated on touch screens. For example, mouse movement and mouse
                                              -26-

button presses, optionally coordinated with single or multiple keyboard presses or holds;
contact movements such as taps, drags, scrolls, etc., on touch-pads; pen stylus inputs;
movement of the device; oral instructions; detected eye movements; biometric inputs;
and/or any combination thereof are optionally utilized as inputs corresponding to sub
events which define an event to be recognized.
[00101]          Fig. 2 illustrates a portable or non-portable multifunction device 100
having a touch screen 112 in accordance with some embodiments. As stated above,
multifunction device 100 is described as having the various illustrated structures (such as
touch screen 112, speaker 111, accelerometer 168, microphone 113, etc.); however, it is
understood that these structures optionally reside on separate devices. For example,
display-related structures (e.g., display, speaker, etc.) and/or functions optionally reside
on a separate display device, input-related structures (e.g., touch-sensitive surface,
microphone, accelerometer, etc.) and/or functions optionally reside on a separate input
device, and remaining structures and/or functions optionally reside on multifunction
device 100.
[00102]          The touch screen 112 optionally displays one or more graphics within user
interface (UI) 200. In this embodiment, as well as others described below, a user is
enabled to select one or more of the graphics by making a gesture on the graphics, for
example, with one or more fingers 202 (not drawn to scale in the figure) or one or more
styluses 203 (not drawn to scale in the figure). In some embodiments, selection of one or
more graphics occurs when the user breaks contact with the one or more graphics. In
some embodiments, the gesture optionally includes one or more taps, one or more swipes
(from left to right, right to left, upward and/or downward) and/or a rolling of a finger
(from right to left, left to right, upward and/or downward) that has made contact with
device 100. In some implementations or circumstances, inadvertent contact with a
graphic does not select the graphic. For example, a swipe gesture that sweeps over an
application icon optionally does not select the corresponding application when the gesture
corresponding to selection is a tap.
[00103]          Device 100 optionally also includes one or more physical buttons, such as

executed on device 100. Alternatively, in some embodiments, the menu button is
implemented as a soft key in a GUI displayed on touch screen 112.
[00104]         In one embodiment, device 100 includes touch screen 112, menu button
204, push button 206 for powering the device on/off and locking the device, volume
adjustment button(s) 208, Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) card slot 210, head set jack
212, and docking/charging external port 124. Push button 206 is, optionally, used to turn
the power on/off on the device by depressing the button and holding the button in the
depressed state for a predefined time interval; to lock the device by depressing the button
and releasing the button before the predefined time interval has elapsed; and/or to unlock
the device or initiate an unlock process. In an alternative embodiment, device 100 also
accepts verbal input for activation or deactivation of some functions through microphone
113. Device 100 also, optionally, includes one or more contact intensity sensors 165 for
detecting intensity of contacts on touch screen 112 and/or one or more tactile output
generators 167 for generating tactile outputs for a user of device 100.
[00105]         Fig. 3 is a block diagram of an exemplary multifunction device with a
display and a touch-sensitive surface in accordance with some embodiments. Device 300
need not include the display and the touch-sensitive surface, as described above, but
rather, in some embodiments, optionally communicates with the display and the touch
sensitive surface on other devices. Additionally, device 300 need not be portable. In
some embodiments, device 300 is a laptop computer, a desktop computer, a tablet
computer, a multimedia player device (such as a television or a set-top box), a navigation
device, an educational device (such as a child's learning toy), a gaming system, or a
control device (e.g., a home or industrial controller). Device 300 typically includes one
or more processing units (CPU's) 310, one or more network or other communications
interfaces 360, memory 370, and one or more communication buses 320 for
interconnecting these components. Communication buses 320 optionally include
circuitry (sometimes called a chipset) that interconnects and controls communications
between system components. Device 300 includes input/output (1/0) interface 330
comprising display 340, which is typically a touch screen display. 1/0 interface 330 also
optionally includes a keyboard and/or mouse (or other pointing device) 350 and touchpad
355, tactile output generator 357 for generating tactile outputs on device 300 (e.g., similar
to tactile output generator(s) 167 described above with reference to Fig. 1A), sensors 359

(e.g., optical, acceleration, proximity, touch-sensitive, and/or contact intensity sensors
similar to contact intensity sensor(s) 165 described above with reference to Fig. 1 A).
Memory 370 includes high-speed random access memory, such as DRAM, SRAM, DDR
RAM or other random access solid state memory devices; and optionally includes non
volatile memory, such as one or more magnetic disk storage devices, optical disk storage
devices, flash memory devices, or other non-volatile solid state storage devices. Memory
370 optionally includes one or more storage devices remotely located from CPU(s) 310.
In some embodiments, memory 370 stores programs, modules, and data structures
analogous to the programs, modules, and data structures stored in memory 102 of
portable or non-portable multifunction device 100 (Fig. 1A), or a subset thereof.
Furthermore, memory 370 optionally stores additional programs, modules, and data
structures not present in memory 102 of portable or non-portable multifunction device
100. For example, memory 370 of device 300 optionally stores drawing module 380,
presentation module 382, word processing module 384, website creation module 386,
disk authoring module 388, and/or spreadsheet module 390, while memory 102 of
portable or non-portable multifunction device 100 (Fig. 1A) optionally does not store
these modules.
[00106]          Each of the above identified elements in Fig. 3 are, optionally, stored in
one or more of the previously mentioned memory devices. Each of the above identified
modules corresponds to a set of instructions for performing a function described above.
The above identified modules or programs (i.e., sets of instructions) need not be
implemented as separate software programs, procedures or modules, and thus various
subsets of these modules are, optionally, combined or otherwise re-arranged in various
embodiments. In some embodiments, memory 370 optionally stores a subset of the
modules and data structures identified above. Furthermore, memory 370 optionally stores
additional modules and data structures not described above.
[00107]          Fig. 4 illustrates an exemplary user interface on a device (e.g., device 300,
Fig. 3) with a touch-sensitive surface 451 (e.g., a tablet or touchpad 355, Fig. 3) that is
separate from the display 450 (e.g., touch screen display 112). Device 300 also,
optionally, includes one or more contact intensity sensors (e.g., one or more of sensors
357) for detecting intensity of contacts on touch-sensitive surface 451 and/or one or more
tactile output generators 359 for generating tactile outputs for a user of device 300.

WO 2015/200371                                                             PCT/US2015/037260
[00108]          Although some of the examples which follow will be given with reference
to inputs on touch screen display 112 (where the touch sensitive surface and the display
are combined), in some embodiments, the device detects inputs on a touch-sensitive
surface that is separate from the display, as shown in Fig. 4. In some embodiments the
touch sensitive surface (e.g., 451 in Fig. 4) has a primary axis (e.g., 452 in Fig. 4) that
corresponds to a primary axis (e.g., 453 in Fig. 4) on the display (e.g., 450). In
accordance with these embodiments, the device detects contacts (e.g., 460 and 462 in Fig.
4) with the touch-sensitive surface 451 at locations that correspond to respective locations
on the display (e.g., in Fig. 4, 460 corresponds to 468 and 462 corresponds to 470). In
this way, user inputs (e.g., contacts 460 and 462, and movements thereof) detected by the
device on the touch-sensitive surface (e.g., 451 in Fig. 4) are used by the device to
manipulate the user interface on the display (e.g., 450 in Fig. 4) of the multifunction
device when the touch-sensitive surface is separate from the display. It should be
understood that similar methods are, optionally, used for other user interfaces described
herein.
[00109]          Additionally, while the following examples are given primarily with
reference to finger inputs (e.g., finger contacts, finger tap gestures, finger swipe gestures),
it should be understood that, in some embodiments, one or more of the finger inputs are
replaced with input from another input device (e.g., a mouse based input or stylus input).
For example, a swipe gesture is, optionally, replaced with a mouse click (e.g., instead of a
contact) followed by movement of the cursor along the path of the swipe (e.g., instead of
movement of the contact). As another example, a tap gesture is, optionally, replaced with
a mouse click while the cursor is located over the location of the tap gesture (e.g., instead
of detection of the contact followed by ceasing to detect the contact). Similarly, when
multiple user inputs are simultaneously detected, it should be understood that multiple
computer mice are, optionally, used simultaneously, or a mouse and finger contacts are,
optionally, used simultaneously.
[00110]          As used herein, the term "focus selector" refers to an input element that
indicates a current part of a user interface with which a user is interacting. In some
implementations that include a cursor or other location marker, the cursor acts as a "focus
selector," so that when an input (e.g., a press input) is detected on a touch-sensitive
surface (e.g., touchpad 355 in Fig. 3 or touch-sensitive surface 451 in Fig. 4) while the
                                              -30-

WO 2015/200371                                                            PCT/US2015/037260
cursor is over a particular user interface element (e.g., a button, window, slider or other
user interface element), the particular user interface element is adjusted in accordance
with the detected input. In some implementations that include a touch-screen display
(e.g., touch-sensitive display system 112 in Fig. 1A or touch screen 112 in Fig. 4A) that
enables direct interaction with user interface elements on the touch-screen display, a
detected contact on the touch-screen acts as a "focus selector," so that when an input
(e.g., a press input by the contact) is detected on the touch-screen display at a location of
a particular user interface element (e.g., a button, window, slider or other user interface
element), the particular user interface element is adjusted in accordance with the detected
input. In some implementations focus is moved from one region of a user interface to
another region of the user interface without corresponding movement of a cursor or
movement of a contact on a touch-screen display (e.g., by using a tab key or arrow keys
to move focus from one button to another button); in these implementations, the focus
selector moves in accordance with movement of focus between different regions of the
user interface. Without regard to the specific form taken by the focus selector, the focus
selector is generally the user interface element (or contact on a touch-screen display) that
is controlled by the user so as to communicate the user's intended interaction with the
user interface (e.g., by indicating, to the device, the element of the user interface with
which the user is intending to interact). For example, the location of a focus selector
(e.g., a cursor, a contact or a selection box) over a respective button while a press input is
detected on the touch-sensitive surface (e.g., a touchpad or touch screen) will indicate that
the user is intending to activate the respective button (as opposed to other user interface
elements shown on a display of the device).
[00111]          In some embodiments described herein, one or more operations are
performed in response to detecting a gesture that includes a respective press input or in
response to detecting the respective press input performed with a respective contact (or a
plurality of contacts), where the respective press input is detected based at least in part on
detecting an increase in intensity of the contact (or plurality of contacts) above a press
input intensity threshold. In some embodiments, the respective operation is performed in
response to detecting the increase in intensity of the respective contact above the press
input intensity threshold (e.g., a "down stroke" of the respective press input). In some
embodiments, the press input includes an increase in intensity of the respective contact
                                               -31-

WO 2015/200371                                                             PCT/US2015/037260
above the press-input intensity threshold and a subsequent decrease in intensity of the
contact below the press-input intensity threshold, and the respective operation is
performed in response to detecting the subsequent decrease in intensity of the respective
contact below the press-input threshold (e.g., an "up stroke" of the respective press input).
[00112]         In some embodiments, the device employs intensity hysteresis to avoid
accidental inputs sometimes termed "jitter," where the device defines or selects a
hysteresis intensity threshold with a predefined relationship to the press-input intensity
threshold (e.g., the hysteresis intensity threshold is X intensity units lower than the press
input intensity threshold or the hysteresis intensity threshold is 75%, 90% or some
reasonable proportion of the press-input intensity threshold). Thus, in some
embodiments, the press input includes an increase in intensity of the respective contact
above the press-input intensity threshold and a subsequent decrease in intensity of the
contact below the hysteresis intensity threshold that corresponds to the press-input
intensity threshold, and the respective operation is performed in response to detecting the
subsequent decrease in intensity of the respective contact below the hysteresis intensity
threshold (e.g., an "up stroke" of the respective press input). Similarly, in some
embodiments, the press input is detected only when the device detects an increase in
intensity of the contact from an intensity at or below the hysteresis intensity threshold to
an intensity at or above the press-input intensity threshold and, optionally, a subsequent
decrease in intensity of the contact to an intensity at or below the hysteresis intensity, and
the respective operation is performed in response to detecting the press input (e.g., the
increase in intensity of the contact or the decrease in intensity of the contact, depending
on the circumstances).
[00113]         For ease of explanation, the description of operations performed in
response to a press input associated with a press-input intensity threshold or in response
to a gesture including the press input are, optionally, triggered in response to detecting
either: an increase in intensity of a contact above the press-input intensity threshold, an
increase in intensity of a contact from an intensity below the hysteresis intensity threshold
to an intensity above the press-input intensity threshold, a decrease in intensity of the
contact below the press-input intensity threshold, and/or a decrease in intensity of the
contact below the hysteresis intensity threshold corresponding to the press-input intensity
threshold. Additionally, in examples where an operation is described as being performed
                                               -32-

in response to detecting a decrease in intensity of a contact below the press-input intensity
threshold, the operation is, optionally, performed in response to detecting a decrease in
intensity of the contact below a hysteresis intensity threshold corresponding to, and lower
than, the press-input intensity threshold.

                  USER INTERFACES AND ASSOCIATED PROCESSES
                                   Content User Interface
[00116]          Many electronic devices provide user interfaces for viewing and selecting
content. There is a need to provide an intuitive way to display and navigate among
content items in a queue of upcoming items and a history of recently played items (e.g.,
songs in an album, playlist, or streaming radio). The embodiments described below
provide a fast, efficient, and convenient way for users to navigate through and select
various content items for consumption.
[00117]          Figures 6A-6Y illustrate an exemplary content user interface in accordance
with some embodiments of the disclosure. The user interfaces in these figures are used to
illustrate the processes described below, including the processes described below with
reference to Figures 7A-7E.
[00118]          Figure 6A illustrates an exemplary content user interface of an electronic
device 500, presented on a display (e.g., display 514 of device 500). The content user
interface includes a plurality of content items 602-1, 602-2, 602-3, 602-4, and 602-5, each
corresponding to a song. The content items illustrated in the figures can each include an
image associated with the content item (e.g., the album art 620 in Figure 6N). The
content user interface further includes a "History" heading 604-1, a "Now Playing"
heading 604-2, and an "Up Next" heading 604-3. The "History" heading 604-1 is
associated with a plurality of content items in a history of content items (e.g., content
items 602-1 and 602-2), and the "History" heading is displayed adjacent to the most
recently played content item in the history, content item 602-2. The "Now Playing"
heading 604-2 is displayed adjacent to the currently playing content item 602-3. The "Up
Next" heading 604-3 is associated with a queue of content items (e.g., content items 602
4 and 602-5), and the "Up Next" heading is displayed adjacent to the content item 602-4
that is next in the queue of content items. Content item 602-3 is highlighted, as indicated
by selection indicator 606. Information 608 and options 610 related to the content item
602-3 are displayed in a region adjacent to the content item 602-3. In some
                                              -34-

WO 2015/200371                                                              PCT/US2015/037260
embodiments, some or all information and/or options are only displayed adjacent to a
selected content item, and in some embodiments, limited information (e.g., artist and song
title) is displayed for unselected content items, as illustrated in Figure 6A.
[00119]          Figures 6A-6D illustrate an example in which, as the plurality of content
items are scrolled, each of headings 604-1, 604-2, and 604-3 scroll along with their
associated content items 602-2, 602-3, and 602-4, respectively. Figures 6C-6E illustrate
that once the currently playing content item 602-3 and the content items 602-4 and 602-5
in the queue of content items are scrolled off screen, the "History" heading 604-1 remains
stationary at the right edge of the display 514 as the user interface scrolls through the
history of recently played content items. Similarly, Figures 6F-61 illustrate an example in
which, once the currently playing content item 602-3 and the content items 602-1 and
602-2 in the history of content items are scrolled off screen, the "Up Next" heading 604-3
remains stationary at the left edge of the display 514 as the user interface scrolls through
the queue of upcoming content items. After scrolling away from the currently playing
content item, the user interface can skip back to the currently playing content item 602-3
(e.g., in response to a swipe gesture or a period of inactivity), as illustrated in Figure 6J.
[00120]          In some embodiments, the "Now Playing" heading 604-2 and the currently
playing content item 602-3 remain on screen during scrolling. For example, while
scrolling through the upcoming queue of content items, heading 604-2 and content item
602-3 optionally remain stationary on the left edge of the display 514 while the content
items in the queue of upcoming content items scroll behind the content item 602-3.
Similarly, while scrolling through the history of content items, heading 604-2 and content
item 602-3 optionally remain stationary on the right edge of the display 514 while the
content items in the history scroll behind the content item 602-3.
[00121]          Figures 6K-6M illustrate advancing playback from the content item 602-3
to the content item 602-4 (e.g., in response to the content item 602-3 reaching the end of
its playback or user input skipping the content item 602-3). The headings 604-1, 604-2,
and 604-3 remain stationary as the plurality of content items 602-1, 602-2, 602-3, 602-4,
and 602-5 scroll such that the no longer playing content item 602-3 is under the "History"
heading 604-1 and the newly playing content item 602-4 is under the "Now Playing"
heading 604-2, as illustrated in Figure 6M. Figure 6N illustrates a background image 622
based on album art 620 associated with the currently playing content item 602-4.

[00122]          Figures 60-6S illustrate a user interface for moving a content item in the
queue of content items. In Figure 60, input is received selecting a menu item 624 for
moving content item 602-4 in the queue. In response to the input, the plurality of content
items 602-5, 602-6, 602-7, 602-8, and 602-9 are presented smaller in an updated user
interface illustrated in Figures 6P-6R. While the updated user interface is presented,
input is received moving the content item 602-4 between content items 602-5 and 602-6
(in Figure 6Q) and then between content items 602-6 and 602-7 (in Figure 6R).
Returning to the main user interface in Figure 6S, the new ordering of the queue of
content items is represented, with content item 602-4 displayed between content items
602-6 and 602-7.
[00123]          Figure 6T illustrates a streaming user interface, including a plurality of
content items 602-1 and 602-2 in the history and only a single content item 602-4 in the
queue. In contrast, Figure 6U illustrates an on-demand user interface, including a single
content item 602-2 in the history and a plurality of content items 602-4 and 602-5 in the
queue. Licensing restrictions for a streaming radio service, for example, optionally
prohibit showing more than one or two items in the "Up Next" queue, and the user
interfaces optionally differ accordingly, as illustrated in Figures 6T and 6U.
[00124]          Figure 6V illustrates a selection of a menu item 626 for playing the
associated content item 602-3. In response to the selection, playback of the content item
602-3 begins, and an additional user interface is presented with a zoomed in view of the
content item 602-3, as illustrated in Figure 6W. The additional user interface in Figure
6W includes the currently playing content item 602-3 displayed larger than other content
items 602-2, 602-4, and 602-5. The user interface also includes additional information

[00125]          Figure 6X illustrates an additional user interface for content items from
streaming radio, including a currently playing content item 602-3, and content items in
the history 602-1 and 602-2, without any content items in an upcoming queue. Figure 6Y
illustrates an additional user interface for content items from a playlist including only
items from a single album, and thus only one image associated with a content item 602-3
is displayed to reduce redundancy and clutter in the user interface.

[00126]          Figures 7A-7E are flow diagrams illustrating a method of a content user
interface in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure. The method is
optionally performed at an electronic device as described above with reference to Figures
lA-B and 2-5 (e.g., electronic device 100, 300, or 500, etc.). Some operations in method
700 are, optionally, combined and/or the order of some operations is, optionally, changed.
[00127]          As described below, the method 700 provides ways in which a device can
display a content user interface. The method reduces the cognitive burden on a user when
interacting with a user interface on the device by providing an intuitive user interface for
selecting content items, thereby creating a more efficient human-machine interface. For
battery-operated electronic devices, increasing the efficiency of the user's interaction with
the user interfaces conserves power and increases the time between battery charges.
[00128]          In some embodiments, an electronic device 500 with one or more
processors and memory generates (702) for presentation on a display (e.g., a remote
display device or a display that is integrated into the electronic device) a user interface
including a plurality of content items (e.g., album art associated with individual songs
and/or albums or playlists, such as content items 602-1, 602-2, 602-3, 602-4, and 602-5 in
Figure 6A), a first heading (e.g., "Now Playing" heading 604-2 in Figure 6A), and a
second heading (e.g., "Up Next" heading 604-3 in Figure 6A).
[00129]          While the user interface is presented on the display, the electronic device
receives (720) input scrolling the plurality of content items (e.g., a swipe, a tap, button
press, etc.). In response to the input, the electronic device scrolls (722) the plurality of
content items including: scrolling (724) the first heading with a first content item of the
plurality of content items that is currently playing; and scrolling (726) the second heading
with a second content item of the plurality of content items that is next in a queue of
content items (e.g., the second content item will play following the first content item that
is currently playing). For example, the first content item optionally remains under the
first heading during the scrolling, and the second content item optionally remains under
the second heading during the scrolling, as illustrated with headings 604-1, 604-2, and
604-3 and corresponding content items 602-2, 602-3, and 602-4, respectively, in Figures
6A-6D and 6F.

WO 2015/200371                                                             PCT/US2015/037260
[00130]          In some embodiments, scrolling the plurality of content items further
includes scrolling (728) the first heading and the first content item offscreen (as
illustrated with heading 604-2 and content item 602-3 from Figures 6F-6G). While the
second heading is presented (730) stationary on the display, the electronic device
optionally scrolls (732) the second content item offscreen, and optionally scrolls (734)
onscreen a plurality of additional content items that are upcoming in the queue of content
items (e.g., the additional content items will play following the second content item). For
example, in Figures 6F-61, the content item 602-4 is scrolled offscreen while the heading
604-3 is presented stationary on the left edge of the display 514.
[00131]          In some embodiments, while the user interface is presented on the display
and the first content item is offscreen, the electronic device optionally receives (746) a
swipe gesture having a first characteristic (e.g., a finger speed, a duration, etc.). In
accordance with a determination that the first characteristic of the swipe gesture exceeds a
predetermined threshold, the electronic device optionally scrolls (748) the plurality of
content items such that the first content item is presented on the display (e.g., the content
items snap back to the currently playing content item). For example, the user interface
optionally snaps back to the currently playing content item 602-3, as illustrated in Figure
6J. In accordance with a determination that the first characteristic of the swipe gesture
does not exceed a predetermined threshold, the electronic device optionally scrolls (750)
through the plurality of content items by an amount (e.g., a number of content items or a
distance on the display) that is based on the first characteristic.
[00132]          In some embodiments, while the user interface is presented on the display
and the first content item is offscreen, the electronic device optionally determines (752) a
time period in which no input is received. In accordance with a determination that the
time period exceeds a predetermined threshold, the electronic device optionally scrolls
(754) the plurality of content items such that the first content item is presented on the
display (e.g., the content items snap back to the currently playing content item so that if
the user is exploring up next content and then walks away from the display, when the user
walks back to the display the now playing content will be displayed). For example, the
user interface optionally snaps back to the currently playing content item 602-3, as
illustrated in Figure 6J.

[00133]         In some embodiments, the user interface further includes (704) a third
heading (e.g., "History" heading 604-1) that is displayed concurrently with the first
heading (e.g., "Now Playing" heading 604-2) and the second heading (e.g., "Up Next"
604-3) before receiving the input. Scrolling the plurality of content items optionally
further includes scrolling (736) the third heading with a third content item of the plurality
of content items that is most recently played in a history of content items (e.g., the second
content item was played prior to the first content item being played), and scrolling (738)
the first heading and the first content item offscreen. While the third heading is presented
(740) stationary on the display, the electronic device optionally scrolls (742) the third
content item offscreen, and optionally scrolls (744) onscreen a plurality of additional
content items in the history of content items (e.g., the additional content items were
played before the third content item). For example, in Figures 6A-6E, the content item
602-2 is scrolled offscreen while the heading 604-1 is presented stationary on the right
edge of the display 514.
[00134]         In some embodiments, while the user interface is presented on the display,
the electronic device optionally receives (756) input selecting a respective content item of
the plurality of content items. In response to the input selecting the respective content
item, the electronic device optionally plays (758) the respective content item, and
optionally zooms in on an image associated with the respective content item. For
example, Figure 6V illustrates a selection of a menu item 626 for playing the associated
content item 602-3. An additional user interface is illustrated in Figure 6W including a
zoomed in view of the content item 602-3.
[00135]         In some embodiments, while the user interface is presented on the display,
the electronic device optionally receives (760) input requesting to move a respective
content item of the queue of content items (e.g., moving an item in the "Up Next" queue).
In response to the input requesting to move the respective content item, the electronic
device optionally updates (762) the user interface by presenting the plurality of content
items smaller in the updated user interface (e.g., in Figures 60-6P, zooming out on the
content items 602-4, 602-5, 602-6, 602-7, 602-8, and 602-9; hiding the "Now Playing"
content item 602-3; only presenting the "Up Next" queue of content items; etc.). While
the updated user interface is presented on the display, the electronic device optionally
moves (764) the respective content item in the queue of content items in response to input
                                              -39-

WO 2015/200371                                                            PCT/US2015/037260
(e.g., in Figures 6P-6R, moving the respective content item 602-4 left or right in the
queue in response to a left or right swipe or button press).
[00136]          In some embodiments, while the user interface is presented on the display,
the electronic device optionally receives (766) a request to present an additional user
interface associated with the currently playing first content item. In response to the
request, the electronic device optionally generates (768) for presentation on the display
the additional user interface including a first image (e.g. content item 602-3 in Figures
6W-6Y) associated with the first content item (e.g., the album art for the first content item
is displayed larger in the now playing interface than in the queue interface). In some
embodiments, the now playing interface includes information about the currently playing
content item not included in the queue interface (e.g., the now playing interface optionally
includes a current playback time and a total duration of the currently playing content
item, as illustrated in Figures 6W-6Y).
[00137]          In some embodiments, the first content item and the second content item
are both associated (770) with a same album, and the first image is associated with the
same album (e.g., when all the songs in the queue are from the same album, that album
art is displayed and no other album art is displayed, as illustrated in Figure 6Y). In some
embodiments, the first content item is optionally associated (772) with a first album, the
second content item is optionally associated with a second album (different from the first
album), and the additional user interface optionally further includes a second image
associated with the second content item (e.g., when the playlist includes content items
from multiple albums, the now playing interface optionally includes one or more images
showing album art for upcoming songs and/or songs in the history, as illustrated in Figure
6W).
[00138]          In some embodiments, the plurality of content items further includes (774)
a third content item that is most recently played in a history of content items played from
streaming radio (e.g., songs streamed over the Internet or other network in a playlist
wherein the precise order and content of the playlist is not chosen by a user of the
electronic device and is instead selected by an intelligent algorithm or a remote user such
as a disc jockey (DJ)), and the additional user interface optionally further includes a third
image associated with the third content item (e.g., when the content items are from a
streaming radio station/playlist, the now playing interface optionally includes one or more
                                              -40-

WO 2015/200371                                                             PCT/US2015/037260
images showing album art for songs in the history). In some embodiments, the now
playing interface for streaming radio optionally does not include upcoming songs due to
contractual obligations (as illustrated in Figure 6X), although some embodiments
optionally include upcoming songs for streaming radio. In some embodiments, the now
playing interface for streaming radio optionally includes a purchase price for the currently
playing content item.
[00139]          In some embodiments, the user interface further includes (706) a
background image based on album art associated with the currently playing first content
item (e.g., the album art is optionally zoomed in such that portions of the album art are
not visible onscreen, as with the background image 622 in Figure 6N, and/or some or all
of the album art is optionally blurred or otherwise visually distorted, etc.). This provides
a subtle cue as to the current audio that is playing, and optionally changes as the audio
that is playing changes. In some embodiments, the album art in the background image
optionally changes to album art associated with the second content item as playback
advances to the second content item. In some embodiments, the album art is used as the
background even when the content items are scrolled so that the first content item is no
longer displayed in the user interface.
[00140]          In some embodiments, the electronic device advances (776) playback such
that the second content item is currently playing and the first content item is no longer
currently playing, and, while the first and second headings are presented stationary on the
display, the electronic device optionally scrolls (778) the first and second content items
such that the currently playing second content item is under the first heading (and,
optionally, changing a background image including album art associated with the first
content item to album art associated with the second content item). Thus, in some
embodiments, when a first song that is currently playing ends and a second song (that is
after the first song) starts playing, the content items shift over while the headers remain in
place (e.g., because the first song is no longer a now playing song and thus is moved to
the history section, while the next song is now a now playing song and is removed from
the up next section). For example, Figures 6K-6M illustrate advancing playback from the
content item 602-3 to the content item 602-4, as both content items scroll while the
headings 604-1, 604-2, and 604-3 remain stationary.

WO 2015/200371                                                           PCT/US2015/037260
[00141]          In some embodiments, in accordance with a determination that the
plurality of content items are on-demand content items, the user interface is optionally
(708) an on-demand user interface (e.g., a user of the device has requested to play content
from a media library of the user such as a media database that includes locally stored
content). In accordance with a determination that the plurality of content items are
streaming content items, the user interface is optionally (710) a streaming user interface
(e.g., the user of the device has requested to play streaming audio such as from a
subscription music service such as internet radio or on-demand streaming audio),
different from the on-demand user interface.
[00142]          In some embodiments, presenting the on-demand user interface on the
display includes presenting (712) a first quantity of the content items in the queue of
content items, and presenting the streaming user interface on the display optionally
includes (714) presenting a second quantity of the content items in the queue of content
items, the second quantity being less than the first quantity. For example, licensing
restrictions for a streaming radio service optionally prohibit showing more than one or
two items in the "Up Next" queue, and the user interfaces optionally differ accordingly.
Figure 6T illustrates a streaming user interface including a single content item 602-4 in an
"Up Next" queue, whereas Figure 6U illustrates an on-demand user interface with a
plurality of content items 602-4 and 602-5 in the queue.
[00143]          In some embodiments, presenting the on-demand user interface on the
display includes presenting (716) only a single content item in a history of content items
(with more content items in the history optionally presented in response to scrolling), and
presenting the streaming user interface on the display optionally includes (718) presenting
a plurality of content items in the history of content items. For example, licensing
restrictions for a streaming radio service optionally prohibit showing more than one or
two items in the "Up Next" queue, so the streaming radio user interface can show more of
the history. Figure 6T illustrates a streaming user interface including a plurality of
content items 602-1 and 602-2 in the history, whereas Figure 6U illustrates an on-demand
user interface with only a single content item 602-2 in the history (e.g., for an on-demand
audio stream, the upcoming tracks are all known while for a streaming radio user
interface, frequently only one or two upcoming tracks are known).

[00144]         The operations in the information processing methods described above are,
optionally, implemented by running one or more functional modules in an information
processing apparatus such as general purpose processors (e.g., as described above with
respect to Figures 1A and 3) or application specific chips.
[00145]         The operations described above with reference to Figs. 7A-7E are,
optionally, implemented by components depicted in Figs. lA-1B. For example,
generating operation 702, receiving operation 720, scrolling operation 722, scrolling
operation 724, and scrolling operation 726 are, optionally implemented by event sorter
170, event recognizer 180, and event handler 190. Event monitor 171 in event sorter 170
detects a contact on touch-sensitive display 112, and event dispatcher module 174
delivers the event information to application 136-1. A respective event recognizer 180 of
application 136-1 compares the event information to respective event definitions 186, and
determines whether a first contact at a first location on the touch-sensitive surface
corresponds to a predefined event or sub-event, such as selection of an object on a user
interface. When a respective predefined event or sub-event is detected, event recognizer
180 activates an event handler 190 associated with the detection of the event or sub-event.
Event handler 190 optionally utilizes or calls data updater 176 or object updater 177 to
update the application internal state 192. In some embodiments, event handler 190
accesses a respective GUI updater 178 to update what is displayed by the application.
Similarly, it would be clear to a person having ordinary skill in the art how other
processes can be implemented based on the components depicted in Figs. lA-1B.
[00146]         It should be understood that the particular order in which the operations in
Figs. 7A-7E have been described is merely exemplary and is not intended to indicate that
the described order is the only order in which the operations could be performed. One of
ordinary skill in the art would recognize various ways to reorder the operations described
herein. Additionally, it should be noted that details of other processes described herein
with respect to other methods described herein (e.g., method 900) are also applicable in
an analogous manner to method 700 described above with respect to Figures 7A-7E. For
example, the user interfaces, user interface objects, queue, history, headings, regions,
album art, content items, information, menu items, and electronic devices described
above with reference to method 700 optionally have one or more of the characteristics of
the user interfaces, user interface objects, queue, history, headings, regions, album art,

                             Simplified Content User Interface
[00147]         Many electronic devices provide cluttered and unintuitive user interfaces
for viewing and selecting content. There is a need to provide an intuitive way to cleanly
and simply display and navigate among content items in a queue of upcoming items and a
history of recently played items (e.g., songs in an album, playlist, or streaming radio).
The embodiments described below provide a fast, efficient, and convenient way for users
to navigate through and select various content items for consumption by hiding
information and menu items for unselected content items.
[00148]         Figures 8A-8L illustrate an exemplary simplified content user interface in
accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure. The user interfaces in these figures
are used to illustrate processes described below, including the processes described below
with reference to Figures 9A-9E.
[00149]         Figure 8A illustrates an exemplary simplified content user interface of an
electronic device 500, presented on a display (e.g., display 514 of device 500). The
simplified content user interface includes user interface objects 802-1, 802-2, 802-3, 802
4, and 802-5, each corresponding to a content item (e.g., a song, a movie, etc.). User
interface object 802-2 is displayed adjacent to the associated region 806-1, user interface
object 802-3 is displayed adjacent to the associated region 806-2, and user interface
object 802-5 is displayed adjacent to the associated region 806-3. Information associated
with the user interface object is displayed in the associated region when the user interface
object is selected.
[00150]         For example, user interface object 802-3 is selected in Figure 8A, and
information 808 associated with the user interface object 802-3 is displayed in the
associated region 806-2. In Figure 8B, user interface object 802-2 is selected,
information 810 associated with the selected user interface object 802-2 is displayed in
the associated region 806-1, and the information 808 is no longer displayed in region 806
2. In Figure 8C, user interface object 802-5 is selected, information 812 associated with
the selected user interface object 802-5 is displayed in the associated region 806-3, and
                                             -44-

the information 810 is no longer displayed in region 806-1. In Figure 8D, user interface
object 802-7 is selected, information 814 associated with the selected user interface object
802-7 is displayed in the associated region 806-4, and the information 812 is no longer
displayed in region 806-3.
[00151]         In Figures 8A-8C, the information displayed when a user interface object
is selected includes both selectable menu items and non-selectable information associated
with the user interface object. For example, non-selectable release dates 816, 820, and
824 are displayed for associated user interface objects 802-3, 802-2, and 802-5,
respectively. In addition, selectable menu items "Pause" 818, "Add to Up Next" 822, and
"Move" 826 are displayed for associated user interface objects 802-3, 802-2, and 802-5,
respectively. In some embodiments, selectable items are different based on the particular
user interface objects. For example, user interface object 802-3 is a currently playing
content item, so the menu item "Pause" 818 is displayed when it is selected. User
interface object 802-2 is in a history of recently played content items, so the menu item
"Add to Up Next" 822 is displayed when it is selected to allow the user to play the song
again. User interface object 802-5 is in a queue of upcoming content items, so the menu
item "Move" 826 is displayed when it is selected to allow the user to move the position of
the song within the queue.
[00152]         As illustrated in Figures 8E-8H, selectable menu items include text
describing actions to be performed with respect to the selected content item. For
example, in Figure 8E, menu item "Play Now" 828 is selectable to play a content item
associated with the selected user interface object 802-2 (as illustrated in Figure 8F). In
Figure 8G, menu item "Move" 830 is selectable to move a content item associated with
the selected user interface object 802-5 within the queue of content items (as illustrated in
Figure 8H).
[00153]         Figures 81-8L illustrate scrolling information associated with user interface
objects. For example, Figures 81 and 8J illustrate scrolling the information 812 associated
with selected user interface object 802-5 while the user interface object 802-7 remains
stationary. Similarly, Figures 8K and 8L illustrate scrolling the information 814
associated with selected user interface object 802-7 while the user interface object 802-5
remains stationary.

combined and/or the order of some operations is, optionally, changed.
[00155]          As described below, the method 900 provides a simplified content user
interface. The method reduces the cognitive burden on a user when interacting with a
user interface on the device by providing an intuitive user interface for selecting content
items, thereby creating a more efficient human-machine interface. For battery-operated
electronic devices, increasing the efficiency of the user's interaction with the user
interfaces conserves power and increases the time between battery charges.
[00156]          In some embodiments, an electronic device 500 with one or more
processors and memory generates (902) for presentation on a display (e.g., a remote
display device or a display that is integrated into the electronic device) a user interface
including: a first user interface object (904) (e.g., cover art for an album, poster for a
movie, etc.) that is associated with a first region of the user interface that is adjacent to
the first user interface object (e.g., below the first UI object in a first column), and a
second user interface object (908) (e.g., cover art for an album, poster for a movie, etc.)
that is associated with a second region of the user interface that is adjacent to the second
user interface object and is different from the first region (e.g., below the second UI
object in a second column, different from the first column). For example, Figures 8A and
8B illustrate a user interface object 802-3 associated with an adjacent region 806-2, and a
user interface object 802-2 associated with an adjacent region 806-1.
[00157]          While the first user interface object is selected (920), the electronic device
causes (922) display, in the first region, of first information that is associated with the
first user interface object (e.g., information describing content associated with the first UI
object and menu items for performing actions with respect to the content) and detects
(936) selection of the second user interface object. For example, Figure 8A illustrates
displaying information 808 in region 806-2 while the user interface object 802-3 is
selected.

WO 2015/200371                                                             PCT/US2015/037260
[00158]         In response to detecting selection of the second user interface object while
the first information is displayed in the first region (938), the electronic device causes
(940) an end of display of the first information in the first region while maintaining
display of the first user interface object, and causes (942) display, in the second region, of
second information that is associated with the second user interface object (e.g.,
information describing content associated with the second UI object and menu items for
performing actions with respect to the content). For example, in Figure 8B, user interface
object 802-2 is selected, information 810 associated with the selected user interface object
802-2 is displayed in the associated region 806-1, and the information 808 is no longer
displayed in region 806-2.
[00159]         In some embodiments, the electronic device receives (952) input scrolling
the first and second user interface objects (e.g., a swipe, a tap, button press, etc.), and in
response to the input scrolling the first and second user interface objects, optionally
scrolls (954) the first region along with the first user interface object and optionally
scrolls the second region along with the second user interface object. For example,
Figures 8A-8D illustrate scrolling the regions 806-1, 806-2, and 806-3 along with the user
interface objects 802-2, 802-3, and 802-5, respectively.
[00160]         In some embodiments, the first information includes (924) one or more
selectable items including a first menu item. While the first user interface object is
selected, the electronic device optionally receives (930) a selection of the first selectable
item (e.g., user input selecting the first menu item while the first menu item is
highlighted). In response to the selection of the first menu item, the electronic device
optionally presents (932) a first user interface response corresponding to the first
selectable item (e.g., playing a content item associated with the first user interface object,
displaying a user interface associated with the first menu item, etc.). For example, in
Figure 8E, menu item "Play Now" 828 is selectable to play a content item associated with
the selected user interface object 802-2 (as illustrated in Figure 8F).
[00161]         In some embodiments, the second information includes (944) one or more
menu items including a second selectable item. While the second user interface object is
selected, the electronic device optionally receives (956) a selection of the second
selectable item (e.g., user input selecting the second selectable item while the second
selectable item is highlighted). In response to the selection of the second selectable item,
                                               -47-

WO 2015/200371                                                           PCT/US2015/037260
the electronic device optionally presents (958) a second user interface response
corresponding to the second selectable item (e.g., playing a content item associated with
the second user interface object, displaying a user interface associated with the second
selectable item, etc.). For example, in Figure 8G, menu item "Move" 830 is selectable to
move a content item associated with the selected user interface object 802-5 within the
queue of content items (as illustrated in Figure 8H).
[00162]          In some embodiments, the one or more selectable items of the first
information are different (946) from the one or more selectable items of the second
information (in accordance with a determination that the first user interface object
belongs to a different group (e.g., "History") than the second user interface object (e.g.,
"Now Playing" or "Up Next")). For example, in Figure 8A, user interface object 802-3 is
a currently playing content item, so the menu item "Pause" 818 is displayed when it is
selected. In Figure 8B, user interface object 802-2 is in a history of recently played
content items, so the menu item "Add to Up Next" 822 is displayed when it is selected to
allow the user to play the song again. In Figure 8C, user interface object 802-5 is in a
queue of upcoming content items, so the menu item "Move" 826 is displayed when it is
selected to allow the user to move the position of the song within the queue. Simplifying
the user interface by forgoing displaying user interface elements that the user is not
directly interacting with enables the user to more easily focus on those user interface
elements and use the device more quickly and efficiently, thereby improving user
experience and reducing the amount of time (and therefore energy) spent using the
device, which is particularly relevant for battery powered devices.
[00163]          In some embodiments, the first user interface object corresponds (906) to a
first content item, the second user interface object optionally corresponds (910) to a
second content item, the first user interface response is optionally associated (934) with
the first content item, and the second user interface response is optionally associated
(960) with the second content item. For example, in Figure 8E, menu item "Play Now"
828 is selectable to play a content item associated with the selected user interface object
802-2 (as illustrated in Figure 8F), and in Figure 8G, menu item "Move" 830 is selectable
to move a content item associated with the selected user interface object 802-5 within the
queue of content items (as illustrated in Figure 8H).

WO 2015/200371                                                             PCT/US2015/037260
[00164]          In some embodiments, the one or more selectable items of the first
information include (926) text describing actions to be performed with respect to the first
content item (e.g., playing the content item, moving the content item in a queue,
purchasing the content item, etc., such as text 828 in Figure 8E), and the one or more
selectable items of the second information optionally include (948) text describing actions
to be performed with respect to the second content item (e.g., playing the content item,
moving the content item in a queue, purchasing the content item, etc., such as text 830 in
Figure 8G).
[00165]          In some embodiments, the first information further includes (928) text
describing the first content item (e.g., song title, release date, purchase price, etc., such as
text 816 in Figure 8A), and the second information optionally further includes (950) text
describing the second content item (e.g., song title, release date, purchase price, etc., such
as text 820 in Figure 8B).
[00166]          In some embodiments, the electronic device receives (962) scrolling input
(e.g., a swipe, a tap, button press, etc.). In response (964) to receiving the scrolling input:
in accordance with a determination that the first user interface object is selected, the
electronic device optionally scrolls (966) the first information while the second user
interface object remains stationary; and in accordance with a determination that the
second user interface object is selected, the electronic device optionally scrolls (968) the
second information while the first user interface object remains stationary. For example,
Figures 81 and 8J illustrate scrolling the information 812 associated with selected user
interface object 802-5 while the user interface object 802-7 remains stationary. Similarly,
Figures 8K and 8L illustrate scrolling the information 814 associated with selected user
interface object 802-7 while the user interface object 802-5 remains stationary.
[00167]          In some embodiments, generating the user interface includes aligning
(914) the first and second user interface objects along a first axis, and positioning (916)
the first region adjacent to the first user interface object along a second axis that is
substantially perpendicular (e.g., the first and second axes are within ten degrees of
perpendicular) to the first axis and positioning the second region adjacent to the second
associated user interface object along the second axis. For example, in Figure 8A, the
user interface objects 802-2 and 802-3 are aligned along a horizontal axis, the region 806
1 is positioned adjacent to the user interface object 802-2 along a vertical axis that is
                                                -49-

WO 2015/200371                                                             PCT/US2015/037260
substantially perpendicular to the horizontal axis, and the region 806-2 is positioned
adjacent to the user interface object 802-3 along the vertical axis.
[00168]         In some embodiments, the first and second user interface objects are (918)
both images having identical spatial dimensions (e.g., the first and second user interface
objects have the same height and width, but are different images, such as different album
covers). For example, in Figure 8A, the user interface objects 802-2 and 802-3 are both
album covers having the same height and width.
[00169]         In some embodiments, the user interface includes (912) a third user
interface object (e.g., cover art for an album, poster for a movie, etc.) that is associated
with a third region of the user interface that is adjacent to the third user interface object
and is different from the first region and the second region (e.g., below the third UI object
in a third column, different from the first column and the second column). For example,
the user interface object 802-5 is associated with the adjacent region 806-3 that is
different from regions 806-1 and 806-2. The electronic device, while the second user
interface object is selected and the second information that is associated with the second
user interface object is displayed in the second region, optionally detects (970) selection
of the third user interface object. In response to detecting selection of the third user
interface object while the second information is displayed in the second region (972), the
electronic device optionally causes (974) an end of display of the second information in
the second region while maintaining display of the second user interface object and
optionally causes (976) display, in the third region, of third information that is associated
with the third user interface object (e.g., information describing content associated with
the third UI object and menu items for performing actions with respect to the content).
For example, in Figure 8C, user interface object 802-5 is selected, information 812
associated with the selected user interface object 802-5 is displayed in the associated
region 806-3, the information 810 is no longer displayed in region 806-1, and the
information 808 is no longer displayed in region 806-2. In some embodiments, a plurality
of additional user interface objects with corresponding regions are displayed in the user
interface and share some of the characteristics of the first, second, and third user interface
objects described above. In some embodiments, information corresponding to a selected
one of the user interface objects is displayed in the region corresponding to the selected
user interface object and information corresponding to non-selected user interface objects

is not displayed, so as to enable the user to focus on the currently selected user interface
object and the options available for interacting with the currently selected user interface
object.
[00170]         The operations in the information processing methods described above are,
optionally, implemented by running one or more functional modules in an information
processing apparatus such as general purpose processors (e.g., as described above with
respect to Figures 1A and 3) or application specific chips.
[00171]         The operations described above with reference to Figs. 9A-9E are,
optionally, implemented by components depicted in Figs. 1A-lB. For example,
generating operation 902, causing operation 922, detecting operation 936, causing
operation 940, and causing operation 942 are, optionally implemented by event sorter
170, event recognizer 180, and event handler 190. Event monitor 171 in event sorter 170
detects a contact on touch-sensitive display 112, and event dispatcher module 174
delivers the event information to application 136-1. A respective event recognizer 180 of
application 136-1 compares the event information to respective event definitions 186, and
determines whether a first contact at a first location on the touch-sensitive surface
corresponds to a predefined event or sub-event, such as selection of an object on a user
interface. When a respective predefined event or sub-event is detected, event recognizer
180 activates an event handler 190 associated with the detection of the event or sub-event.
Event handler 190 optionally utilizes or calls data updater 176 or object updater 177 to
update the application internal state 192. In some embodiments, event handler 190
accesses a respective GUI updater 178 to update what is displayed by the application.
Similarly, it would be clear to a person having ordinary skill in the art how other
processes can be implemented based on the components depicted in Figs. 1A-1B.
[00172]         It should be understood that the particular order in which the operations in
Figs. 9A-9E have been described is merely exemplary and is not intended to indicate that
the described order is the only order in which the operations could be performed. One of
ordinary skill in the art would recognize various ways to reorder the operations described
herein. Additionally, it should be noted that details of other processes described herein
with respect to other methods described herein (e.g., method 700) are also applicable in
an analogous manner to method 900 described above with respect to Figures 9A-9E. For
example, the user interfaces, user interface objects, queue, history, headings, regions,

album art, content items, information, menu items, and electronic devices described
above with reference to method 900 optionally have one or more of the characteristics of
the user interfaces, user interface objects, queue, history, headings, regions, album art,
content items, information, menu items, and electronic devices described herein with
reference to other methods described herein (e.g., method 700). For brevity, these details
are not repeated here.
[00173]          In accordance with some embodiments, Figure 10 shows a functional
block diagram of an electronic device 1000 configured in accordance with the principles
of the various described embodiments. The functional blocks of the device are,
optionally, implemented by hardware, software, or a combination of hardware and
software to carry out the principles of the various described embodiments. It is
understood by persons of skill in the art that the functional blocks described in Figure 10
are, optionally, combined or separated into sub-blocks to implement the principles of the
various described embodiments. Therefore, the description herein optionally supports
any possible combination or separation or further definition of the functional blocks
described herein.

an audio unit 1008 to playback audio and/or send audio to another device for audio
playback; and a processing unit 1010 coupled to the display unit 1002 and the input unit
1004. In some embodiments, the processing unit 1010 optionally includes a display
enabling unit 1012, a receiving unit 1014, a determining unit 1016, and an audio enabling
unit 1018.
[00175]          In some embodiments, the processing unit 1010 is configured to generate
(e.g., with the display enabling unit 1012) for presentation on a display a user interface
including a plurality of content items, a first heading, and a second heading. While the
user interface is presented on the display, the processing unit 1010 is configured to
receive (e.g., with the receiving unit 1014) input scrolling the plurality of content items.
In response to the input, the processing unit 1010 is configured to scroll (e.g., with the
display enabling unit 1012) the plurality of content items including: scrolling (e.g., with

the display enabling unit 1012) the first heading with a first content item of the plurality
of content items that is currently playing; and scrolling (e.g., with the display enabling
unit 1012) the second heading with a second content item of the plurality of content items
that is next in a queue of content items.
[00176]          In some embodiments, scrolling the plurality of content items further
includes: scrolling (e.g., with the display enabling unit 1012) the first heading and the
first content item offscreen; and while the second heading is presented stationary on the
display: scrolling (e.g., with the display enabling unit 1012) the second content item
offscreen; and scrolling (e.g., with the display enabling unit 1012) onscreen a plurality of
additional content items that are upcoming in the queue of content items.
[00177]          In some embodiments, the processing unit 1010 is further configured to,
while the user interface is presented on the display and the first content item is offscreen,
receive (e.g., with the receiving unit 1014) a swipe gesture having a first characteristic.
In accordance with a determination that the first characteristic of the swipe gesture
exceeds a predetermined threshold, the processing unit 1010 is further configured to
scroll (e.g., with the display enabling unit 1012) the plurality of content items such that
the first content item is presented on the display, and in accordance with a determination
that the first characteristic of the swipe gesture does not exceed a predetermined
threshold, the processing unit 1010 is further configured to scroll (e.g., with the display
enabling unit 1012) through the plurality of content items by an amount that is based on
the first characteristic.
[00178]          In some embodiments, the processing unit 1010 is further configured to,
while the user interface is presented on the display and the first content item is offscreen,
determine (e.g., with the determining unit 1016) a time period in which no input is
received. In accordance with a determination that the time period exceeds a
predetermined threshold, the processing unit 1010 is further configured to scroll (e.g.,
with the display enabling unit 1012) the plurality of content items such that the first
content item is presented on the display.
[00179]          In some embodiments, the user interface further includes a third heading
that is displayed (e.g., with the display enabling unit 1012) concurrently with the first
heading and the second heading before receiving the input, and scrolling the plurality of

content items further includes: scrolling (e.g., with the display enabling unit 1012) the
third heading with a third content item of the plurality of content items that is most
recently played in a history of content items; scrolling (e.g., with the display enabling unit
1012) the first heading and the first content item offscreen; and while the third heading is
presented stationary on the display: scrolling (e.g., with the display enabling unit 1012)
the third content item offscreen; and scrolling (e.g., with the display enabling unit 1012)
onscreen a plurality of additional content items in the history of content items.
[00180]         In some embodiments, the processing unit 1010 is further configured to,
while the user interface is presented on the display, receive (e.g., with the receiving unit
1014) input selecting a respective content item of the plurality of content items. In
response to the input selecting the respective content item, the processing unit 1010 is
further configured to play (e.g., with the audio enabling unit 1018) the respective content
item and zoom in (e.g., with the display enabling unit 1012) on an image associated with
the respective content item.
[00181]         In some embodiments, the processing unit 1010 is further configured to,
while the user interface is presented on the display, receive (e.g., with the receiving unit
1014) input requesting to move a respective content item of the queue of content items.
In response to the input requesting to move the respective content item, the processing
unit 1010 is further configured to update (e.g., with the display enabling unit 1012) the
user interface by presenting the plurality of content items smaller in the updated user
interface. While the updated user interface is presented on the display, the processing
unit 1010 is further configured to move (e.g., with the display enabling unit 1012) the
respective content item in the queue of content items in response to input.
[00182]         In some embodiments, the processing unit 1010 is further configured to,
while the user interface is presented on the display, receive (e.g., with the receiving unit
1014) a request to present an additional user interface associated with the currently
playing first content item. In response to the request, the processing unit 1010 is further
configured to generate (e.g., with the display enabling unit 1012) for presentation on the
display the additional user interface including a first image associated with the first
content item. In some embodiments, the first content item and the second content item
are both associated with a same album, and the first image is associated with the same
album. In some embodiments, the first content item is associated with a first album, the

second content item is associated with a second album, and the additional user interface
further includes a second image associated with the second content item. In some
embodiments, the plurality of content items further includes a third content item that is
most recently played in a history of content items played from streaming radio, and the
additional user interface further includes a third image associated with the third content
item. In some embodiments, the user interface further includes a background image
based on album art associated with the currently playing first content item.
[00183]         In some embodiments, the processing unit 1010 is further configured to
advance (e.g., with the audio enabling unit 1018) playback such that the second content
item is currently playing and the first content item is no longer currently playing. While
the first and second headings are presented stationary on the display, the processing unit
1010 is further configured to scroll (e.g., with the display enabling unit 1012) the first and
second content items such that the currently playing second content item is under the first
heading.
[00184]         In some embodiments, in accordance with a determination that the
plurality of content items are on-demand content items, the user interface is an on
demand user interface; and in accordance with a determination that the plurality of
content items are streaming content items, the user interface is a streaming user interface,
different from the on-demand user interface. In some embodiments, presenting the on
demand user interface on the display includes presenting (e.g., with the display enabling
unit 1012) a first quantity of the content items in the queue of content items, and
presenting the streaming user interface on the display includes presenting (e.g., with the
