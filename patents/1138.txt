                                         Abstract
          The   invention    provides    compositions   of   novel    high   penetration
compositions (HPC) or high penetration prodrugs (HPP) for treatment of pulmonary
conditions (e.g. asthma). The HPCs/HPPs are capable of being converted to parent
active drugs or drug metabolites after crossing the biological barrier and thus can
render treatments for the conditions that the parent drugs or metabolites can.
Additionally, the HPPs are capable of reaching areas that parent drugs may not be
able to access or to render a sufficient concentration at the target areas and therefore
render novel treatments. The HPCs/HPPs can be administered to a subject through
various administration routes, e.g., locally delivered to an action site of a condition
with a high concentration or systematically administered to a biological subject and
enter the general circulation with a faster rate.

CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS
[0001]    The present application      claims priority to Chinese Patent Application No.
20121015155.7, filed May 16, 2012, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety,
as if fully set forth herein. The present application is a divisional of AU2013262320, which
is the national phase entry of PCT/CN2013/072693, the entire specifications of which are
incorporated herein by cross-reference.
FIELD OF THE INVENTION
[0002]    This invention relates to the field of pharmaceutical compositions capable of
penetrating one or more biological barriers and methods of using the pharmaceutical
compositions for preventing and/or treating pulmonary conditions (e.g. asthma, lower, and
upper respiratory tract infections) in humans and animals.         The invention also relates to
methods of using the pharmaceutical compositions for screening new drug candidates.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
[0003]    Pulmonary conditions may be caused by allergy, inflammation, bacterial infections,
or a combination thereof. For example, asthma is a chronic inflammatory condition of the
respiratory tract (airway) characterized by airflow obstruction and bronchospasm. Asthma
can be classified as a variable and partially reversible obstruction to air flow involving an
overdeveloped mucus gland, airway thickening due to scarring and inflammation, and
bronchoconstriction.     Bronchoconstriction is caused by edema and swelling which may be
triggered by an immune response to allergens. Bacterial infections of the upper respiratory
tract infection can also worsen asthmatic symptoms.
[0004]    The airway of an asthmatic or a subject that is experiencing a chronic pulmonary
condition (e.g. emphysema and chronic bronchitis) may be thickened due to scaring and
inflammation. Therefore, a need exists in the art for novel compositions that are capable of
efficient and effective delivery to the action site of a pulmonary

                                              2
condition (e.g., asthma, lower, and upper respiratory tract infections) of a subject to
prevent, reduce or treat conditions as well as minimize adverse side effects.
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
1. Structures of high penetration prodrug (HPP) or high penetration composition
(HPC).
[0005]           One aspect of the invention is directed to a high penetration prodrug
(HPP) or a high penetration composition (HPC). The term "high penetration prodrug" or
"HPP" or "high penetration composition" or "HPC" as used herein refers to a
composition comprising a functional unit covalently linked to a transportational unit
through a linker.
[0006]           Functional Unit
[0007]           A functional unit of an HPP or HPC which comprises a moiety of a
parent drug has the properties of: 1) the delivery of the parent drug or the HPP/HPC into
a biological subject and/or the transportation of the parent drug across one or more
biological barriers are/is desired, 2) the HPP/HPC is capable of penetrating or crossing
one or more biological barriers, and 3) the HPP/HPC is capable of being cleaved so as
to turn the moiety of a parent drug into the parent drug or a metabolite of the parent
drug.
[0008]           In certain embodiments, a functional unit may be hydrophilic, lipophilic,
or amphiphilic (hydrophilic and lipophilic). The lipophilic moiety of the functional unit
may be inherent or achieved by converting one or more hydrophilic moieties of the
functional unit to lipophilic moieties. For example, a lipophilic moiety of a functional unit
is produced by converting one or more hydrophilic groups of the functional unit to
lipophilic groups via organic synthesis. Examples of hydrophilic groups include, without
limitation, carboxylic, hydroxyl, thiol, amine, phosphate/phosphonate, guanidine and
carbonyl groups. Lipophilic moieties produced via the modification of these hydrophilic
groups include, without limitation, ethers, thioethers, esters, thioesters, carbonates,
carbamates, amides, phosphates and oximes. In certain embodiments, a functional unit
is converted to a more lipophilic moiety through acetylation or acylation(alkanoylation).

                                               3
In certain embodiments, a functional unit is converted to a more lipophilic moiety via
esterification.
[0009]            In certain embodiments, a parent drug of an HPP or HPC is a drug that
can be used by itself or in combination with other drug(s) to treat pulmonary conditions
(e.g. asthma, lower, and upper respiratory tract infections, chronic bronchitis, chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease, emphysema, cystic fibrosis, pneumonia, sarcoidosis,
and pulmonary fibrosis) or a related compound thereof. A related compound of a parent
drug is a compound comprising the structure of the parent drug, a metabolite of the
parent drug, or an agent that can be metabolized into the parent drug or a metabolite of
the parent drug after an HPP or HPC penetrates one or more biological barriers. A
related compound of a parent drug further includes a compound that is an analog or
mimic of the parent drug or a metabolite of the parent drug, or an agent that can be
metabolized into an analog or mimic of the parent drug or a metabolite of the parent
drug, after an HPP or HPC penetrates one or more biological barriers.
[0010]           The moiety of a parent drug or the related compound thereof can be
further converted to a lipophilic moiety as described supra. The main classes of drugs
that can be used to treat pulmonary conditions (e.g. asthma, lower, and upper
respiratory tract infections, chronic bronchitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
emphysema, cystic fibrosis, pneumonia, sarcoidosis, and pulmonary fibrosis) include,
for example, antihistamines, p2-adrenergic receptor agonists, 5-lipoxygenase-activating
protein (FLAP) inhibitors, 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors, leukotriene receptor antagonists,
anti-inflammatory drugs, cough suppressants, decongestants, and antibiotics.

[0022]            Transportational Unit
[0023]            A transportational unit of an HPP comprises a protonatable amine group
that is capable of facilitating the transportation or crossing of the HPP through one or
more biological barriers (e.g., > about 20 times, > about 50 times, > about 100 times, >
about 300 times, > about 500 times, > about 1,000 times or more faster than the parent
drug).     In certain embodiments, the protonatable amine group is substantially
protonated at a physiological pH.         In certain embodiments, the amine group can be
reversibly protonated. In certain embodiments, a transportational unit may or may not
be cleaved from the functional unit after the penetration of HPP through one or more
biological barriers.
[0024]            In certain embodiments, a functional unit may also contain one or more
transportational units, especially for parent drugs that have at least a free amino group.
In certain embodiments, when a functional unit contains one or more transportational

                                                     8
units, the functional unit is modified such that only one or two amine groups are
protobatable.        In certain embodiments, a functional unit contains one or two amine
groups. These functional units can be modified or can be used as HPCs without further
modifications.        Examples of compounds that have one or two amine groups include,
without          limitation,       pheniramine,         fluorpheniramine,         chlorpheniramine,

II. Pharmaceutical compositions comprising HPPs
[0043]       Another aspect of the invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition
comprising at least one HPP of a parent drug that can be used to treat pulmonary
conditions (e.g. asthma, lower, and upper respiratory tract infections, chronic bronchitis,
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, emphysema, cystic fibrosis, pneumonia,
sarcoidosis, and      pulmonary fibrosis) or a       related   compound thereof,     and   a
pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.

                                               59
[0044]          A pharmaceutical composition may comprise more than one HPP of
different parent drugs. The different parent drugs can belong to the same or different
categories of drugs that are used to treat pulmonary conditions (e.g. asthma, lower, and
upper respiratory tract infections, chronic bronchitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease, emphysema, cystic fibrosis, pneumonia, sarcoidosis, and pulmonary fibrosis).
For example, a pharmaceutical composition may comprise HPPs of parent drugs or
related compounds thereof, the parent drugs being selected from the group consisting
of antihistamines, p2-adrenergic receptor agonists, anti-inflammatory drugs, cough
suppressants, decongestants, antibiotics, and any combinations thereof.
[0045]          A pharmaceutical composition may comprise HPPs of parent drugs of
the same class of drugs that can be used to treat pulmonary conditions. For example, a
pharmaceutical composition may comprise HPPs of more than one antihistamines, p2
adrenergic    receptor   agonists,    anti-inflammatory     drugs,    cough    suppressants,
decongestants, and/or antibiotics.
[0046]          A pharmaceutical composition may comprise more than one high
penetration prodrug, the first parent drug selected from the group consisting of
antihistamines, p2-adrenergic      receptor agonists, anti-inflammatory        drugs,   cough
suppressants, decongestants,        antibiotics, and    any combination      thereof.      The
pharmaceutical composition may further comprise at least a second parent drug
selected from the group consisting of antihistamines, p2-adrenergic receptor agonists,
5-lipoxygenase-activating    protein     (FLAP)    inhibitors,   5-lipoxygenase     inhibitors,
leukotriene   receptor antagonists, anti-inflammatory         drugs,   cough   suppressants,
decongestants, antibiotics, and any combination thereof. The second parent drug may
also be selected from the group consisting of dextromethorphan, pentoxyverine,
clemastine, diphenhydramine, doxylamine, desloratadine, chlorophenamine, ephedrine,
and levomethamphetamin.
[0047]          A pharmaceutical composition may further comprise drugs that can
penetrate biological barriers efficiently (e.g. penetrating skin at a rate >0.01mg/cm 2/h).
Examples of such drugs include, without limitation, dextromethorphan, pentoxyverine,
clemastine, diphenhydramine, doxylamine, desloratadine, chlorophenamine, ephedrine,
and levomethamphetamine

vardenafil hydrochloride, and HPPs of penicilin V, ibuprofen, zileuton, and fexofenadine.
[00102]       The term "pharmaceutically acceptable carrier" as used herein means a
pharmaceutically-acceptable material, composition or vehicle, such as a liquid or solid
filler, diluent, excipient, solvent or encapsulating material, involved in carrying or
transporting an HPP from one location, body fluid, tissue, organ (interior or exterior), or
portion of the body, to another location, body fluid, tissue, organ, or portion of the body.
[00103]       Each carrier is "pharmaceutically acceptable" in the sense of being
compatible with the other ingredients, e.g., an HPP, of the formulation and suitable for
use in contact with the tissue or organ of a biological subject without excessive toxicity,
irritation, allergic response, immunogenicity, or other problems or complications,
commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio.
[00104]       Some examples of materials which can serve as pharmaceutically
acceptable carriers include: (1) sugars, such as lactose, glucose and sucrose; (2)

                                              71
starches, such as corn starch and potato starch; (3) cellulose, and its derivatives, such
as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose and cellulose acetate; (4) powdered
tragacanth; (5) malt; (6) gelatin; (7) talc; (8) excipients, such as cocoa butter and
suppository waxes; (9) oils, such as peanut oil, cottonseed oil, safflower oil, sesame oil,
olive oil, corn oil and soybean oil; (10) glycols, such as propylene glycol; (11) polyols,
such as glycerin, sorbitol, mannitol and polyethylene glycol; (12) esters, such as ethyl
oleate and ethyl laurate; (13) agar; (14) buffering agents, such as magnesium hydroxide
and aluminum hydroxide; (15) alginic acid; (16) pyrogen-free water; (17) isotonic saline;
(18) Ringer's solution; (19) alcohol, such as ethyl alcohol and propane alcohol; (20)
phosphate buffer solutions; and (21) other non-toxic compatible substances employed
in pharmaceutical formulations such as acetone.
[00105]       The pharmaceutical compositions may contain pharmaceutically acceptable
auxiliary substances as required to approximate physiological conditions such as pH
adjusting and buffering agents, toxicity adjusting agents and the like, for example,
sodium acetate, sodium chloride, potassium chloride, calcium chloride, sodium lactate
and the like.
[00106]       In one embodiment, the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier is an aqueous
carrier, e.g. buffered saline and the like. In certain embodiments, the pharmaceutically
acceptable carrier is a polar solvent, e.g. acetone and alcohol.
[00107]       The concentration of HPP in these formulations can vary widely, and will be
selected primarily based on fluid volumes, viscosities, body weight and the like in
accordance with the particular mode of administration selected and the biological
subject's needs. For example, the concentration can be 0.0001% to 100%, 0.001% to
50%, 0.01% to 30%, 0.1% to 20%, 1% to 10% wt.
[00108]       The compositions of the invention can be administered for prophylactic,
therapeutic, and/or hygienic use. Such administration can be topical, mucosal, e.g., oral,
nasal,    vaginal,   rectal,  parenteral,   transdermal,   subcutaneous,     intramuscular,
intravenous, via inhalation, ophthalmic and other convenient routes. The pharmaceutical
compositions can be administered in a variety of unit dosage forms depending upon the
method     of administration.   For example,      unit dosage forms     suitable for oral

                                             72
administration include powder, tablets, pills, capsules and lozenges and for transdermal
administration include solution, suspension and gel.
[00109]      Thus, a typical pharmaceutical composition for transdermal, oral, and
intravenous administrations would be about 10-8 g to about 100 g, about 10-8 g to about
10-5 g, about 10-6 g to about 1 g, about 10-6 g to about 100 g, about 0.001 g to about
100 g, about 0.01 g to about 10 g, or about 0.1 g to about 1 g per subject per day.
Dosages from about 0.001 mg, up to about 100 g, per subject per day may be used.
Actual methods for preparing parenterally administrable compositions will be known or
apparent to those skilled in the art and are described in more detail in such publications
as Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy 21st ed., Lippincott Williams &
Wilkins, (2005).
Ill. Applications of HPPs
i) Methods for penetrating a biologicalbarrier.
[00110]      Another aspect of the invention relates to a method of using a composition
of the invention in penetrating one or more biological barriers in a biological subject.
The method comprises a step of administering to a biological subject an HPP or a
pharmaceutical composition thereof. In certain embodiments, an HPP exhibits more
than about 20 times or higher, 50 times or higher, > about 100 times or higher, > about
200 time higher, >about 300 times or higher, >about 500 times or higher, >about 1,000
times or higher penetration rate through one or more biological barriers than its parent
drug.
[00111]      The term "biological barrier" as used herein refers to a biological layer that
separates an environment into different spatial areas or compartments, which
separation is capable of modulating (e.g. restricting, limiting, enhancing or taking no
action in) the passing through, penetrating or translocation of substance or matter from
one compartment/area to another.        The different spatial areas or compartments as
referred to herein may have the same or different chemical or biological environment(s).
The biological layer as referred herein includes, but is not limited to, a biological
membrane, a cell layer, a biological structure, an inner surface of subjects, organisms,

                                               73
organs or body cavities, an external surface of subjects, organisms, organs or body
cavities, or any combination or plurality thereof.
[00112]       Examples of a biological membrane include a lipid bilayer structure,
eukaryotic cell membrane, prokaryotic cell membrane, and intracellular membrane (e.g.,
nucleus or organelle membrane, such as membrane or envelope of Golgi apparatus,
rough and smooth endoplasmic reticulum (ER), ribosomes, vacuoles, vesicles,
liposomes, mitochondria, lysosome, nucleus, chloroplasts, plastids, peroxisomes or
microbodies).
[00113]       The lipid bilayer referred to herein is a double layer of lipid-class molecules,
including, but not limited to, phospholipids and cholesterol. In a particular embodiment,
lipids for bilayer are amphiphilic molecules consisting of polar head groups and non
polar fatty acid tails. The bilayer is composed of two layers of lipids arranged so that
their hydrocarbon tails face one another to form an oily core held together by the
hydrophobic effect, while their charged heads face the aqueous solutions on either side
of the membrane. In another particular embodiment, the lipid bilayer may contain one
or more embedded protein and/or sugar molecule(s).
[00114]       Examples of a cell layer include a lining of eukaryotic cells (e.g., epithelium,
lamina propria and smooth muscle or muscularis mucosa (in gastrointestinal tract)), a
lining of prokaryotic cells (e.g., surface layer or S-layer which refers to a two
dimensional structure       monomolecular     layer composed       of identical proteins    or
glycoproteins, specifically, an S-layer refers to a part of a cell envelope commonly found
in bacteria and archaea), a biofilm (a structured community of microorganisms
encapsulated within a self-developed polymeric matrix and adherent to a living or inert
surface), and a plant cell layer (e.g., empidermis). The cells may be normal cells or
pathological cells (e.g. disease cells, cancer cells).
[00115]       Examples of biological structures include structures sealed by tight or
occluding junctions that provide a barrier to the entry of toxins, bacteria and viruses, e.g.
the blood milk barrier and the blood brain barrier (BBB). In particular, BBB is composed
of an impermeable class of endothelium, which presents both a physical barrier through
tight junctions adjoining neighboring endothelial cells and a transport barrier comprised

                                               74
of efflux transporters.    The biological structure may also include a mixture of cells,
proteins and sugars (e.g. blood clots).
[00116]      Examples of the inner surface of subjects, organisms, organs or body
cavities include buccal mucosa, esophageal mucosa, gastric mucosa, intestinal mucosa,
olfactory mucosa, oral mucosa, bronchial mucosa, uterine mucosa and endometrium
(the mucosa of the uterus, inner layer of the wall of a pollen grain or the inner wall layer
of a spore), or a combination or plurality thereof.
[00117]      Examples of the external surface of subjects, organisms, organs or body
cavities include capillaries (e.g. capillaries in the heart tissue), mucous membranes that
are continuous with skin (e.g. such as at the nostrils, the lips, the ears, the genital area,
and the anus), outer surface of an organ (e.g. liver, lung, stomach, brain, kidney, heart,
ear, eye, nose, mouth, tongue, colon, pancreas, gallbladder, duodenum, rectum
stomach, colonrectum, intestine, vein, respiratory system, vascular, anorectum and
pruritus ani), skin, cuticle (e.g. dead layers of epidermal cells or keratinocytes or
superficial layer of overlapping cells covering the hair shaft of an animal, a multi-layered
structure outside the epidermis of many invertebrates, plant cuticles or polymers cutin
and/or cutan), external layer of the wall of a pollen grain or the external wall layer of a
spore), and a combination or plurality thereof.
[00118]      In addition, a biological barrier further includes a sugar layer, a protein layer
or any other biological layer, or a combination or plurality thereof. For example, skin is
a biological barrier that has a plurality of biological layers.        A skin comprises an
epidermis layer (outer surface), a demis layer and a subcutaneous layer. The epidermis
layer contains several layers including a basal cell layer, a spinous cell layer, a granular
cell layer, and a stratum corneum. The cells in the epidermis are called keratinocytes.
The stratum corneum ("horny layer") is the outmost layer of the epidermis, wherein cells
here are flat and scale-like ("squamous") in shape. These cells contain a lot of keratin
and are arranged in overlapping layers that impart a tough and oilproof and waterproof
character to the skin's surface.

the ability of a test functional unit to form a high penetration composition or convert back
to a parent drug, 2) the penetration ability and/or rate of a test composition, 3) the
efficiency and/or efficacy of a test composition, 4) the transportational ability of a test
transportational unit, and 5) the cleavability of a test linker.

v). Methods of using HPPs and pharmaceutical compositions thereof in
treatments ofpulmonary conditions.
[00130]            Another aspect of the invention relates to a method of using HPPs or
pharmaceutical compositions thereof in treating a pulmonary condition in a biological
subject or subject by administrating one or more HPPs or a pharmaceutical composition
thereof to the biological subject or subject.
[00131]            Such pulmonary conditions include, but are not limited to, asthma, lower,
and upper respiratory tract infections, chronic bronchitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease, emphysema, cystic fibrosis, pneumonia, sarcoidosis, pulmonary fibrosis,
allergic rhinitis, allergic conjunctivitis, itchiness, and runny nose.
[00132]            In certain embodiments, a method of treating a pulmonary condition in a
subject comprises administering a therapeutic effective amount of the one or more
HPPs, or a pharmaceutical composition thereof to the subject.
[00133]            In certain embodiments, a pharmacy composition as described supra
comprises a first group of HPP(s) and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, wherein
the parent drug(s) of the first group of HPP(s) are the first group of parent drug(s)
comprising at least one parent drug selected from the grou consisting of antihistamines,

further comprise a third group of drugs selected from the grou consisting of sildenafil,
vardenafil, tadalafil, acetildenafil, avanafil, lodenafil,       mirodenafil, metaproterenol,
clemastine, udenafil, and salts thereof, as well as any combination thereof.

                                              78
[00134]          In certain embodiments, the first pharmaceutical composition comprises
the first group, the second group, and/or the third grou of HPP and a pharmaceutically
acceptable carrier and the first pharmaceutical composition is applied first to the subject,
then after the condition of the subject improves, a second pharmaceutical composition
comprising the second group of HPP (e.g. HPP of aspirin) and a pharmaceutically
acceptable crrier was administered to the subject to prevent the pulmonary condition
from coming back.
[00135]          The one or more HPPs or a pharmaceutical composition thereof can be
administered to a biological subject by any administration route known in the art,
including without limitation, oral, enteral, buccal, nasal, topical, rectal, vaginal, aerosol,
transmucosal, epidermal, transdermal, dermal, ophthalmic, pulmonary, subcutaneous,
and/or    parenteral   administration.      The    pharmaceutical    compositions     can    be
administered in a variety of unit dosage forms depending upon the method of
administration.
[00136]          A parenteral administration refers to an administration route that
typically relates to injection which includes but is not limited to intravenous,
intramuscular,    intraarterial, intrathecal,   intracapsular, intraorbital,   intra   cardiac,
intradermal, intraperitoneal, transtracheal, subcutaneous, subcuticular, intraarticular,
subcapsular, subarachnoid, intraspinal, and/or intrasternal injection and/or infusion.
[00137]          The one or more HPPs or a pharmaceutical composition thereof can be
given to a subject in the form of formulations or preparations suitable for each
administration route. The formulations useful in the methods of the invention include
one or more HPPs, one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers therefor, and
optionally other therapeutic ingredients.         The formulations may conveniently be
presented in unit dosage form and may be prepared by any methods well known in the
art of pharmacy. The amount of active ingredient which can be combined with a carrier
material to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the subject being
treated and the particular mode of administration. The amount of an HPP which can be
combined with a carrier material to produce a pharmaceutically effective dose will
generally be that amount of an HPP which produces a therapeutic effect. Generally, out

                                               79
of one hundred percent, this amount will range from about 0.01 percent to about ninety
nine percent of the HPP, preferably from about 0.1 percent to about 20 percent.
[00138]          Methods of preparing these formulations or compositions include the
step of bringing into association an HPP with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable
carriers and, optionally, one or more accessory ingredients. In general, the formulations
are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association an HPP with liquid
carriers, or finely divided solid carriers, or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the
product.
[00139]          Formulations suitable for oral administration may be in the form of
capsules, cachets, pills, tablets, lozenges (using a flavored basis, usually sucrose and
acacia or tragacanth), powders, granules, or as a solution or a suspension in an
aqueous or non- aqueous liquid, or as an oil-in-water or water-in-oil liquid emulsion, or
as an elixir or syrup, or as pastilles (using an inert base, such as gelatin and glycerin, or
sucrose and acacia) and/or as mouth washes and the like, each containing a
predetermined amount of an HPP as an active ingredient. A compound may also be
administered as a bolus, electuary, or paste.
[00140]          In solid dosage forms for oral administration (e. g., capsules, tablets,
pills, dragees, powders, granules and the like), the HPP is mixed with one or more
pharmaceutically-acceptable carriers, such as sodium citrate or dicalcium phosphate,
and/or any of the following: (1) fillers or extenders, such as starches, lactose, sucrose,
glucose,    mannitol,    and/or  silicic   acid;  (2)  binders,  such    as,  for   example,
carboxymethylcellulose, alginates, gelatin, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, sucrose and/or acacia;
(3) humectants, such as glycerol; (4) disintegrating agents, such as agar-agar, calcium
carbonate, potato or tapioca starch, alginic acid, certain silicates, and sodium carbonate,
(5) solution retarding agents, such as paraffin, (6) absorption accelerators, such as
quaternary ammonium compounds; (7) wetting agents, such as, for example, cetyl
alcohol and glycerol monostearate; (8) absorbents, such as kaolin and bentonite clay; (9)
lubricants, such a talc, calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, solid polyethylene glycols,
sodium lauryl sulfate, and mixtures thereof; and (10) coloring agents.        In the case of
capsules, tablets and pills, the pharmaceutical compositions may also comprise
buffering agents. Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in

                                               80
soft and hard-filled gelatin capsules using such excipients as lactose or milk sugars, as
well as high molecular weight polyethylene glycols and the like.
[00141]           A tablet may be made by compression or molding, optionally with one or
more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets may be prepared using binder (for
example, gelatin or hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose), lubricant, inert diluent, preservative,
disintegrant    (for   example,   sodium     starch   glycolate     or   cross-linked  sodium
carboxymethyl cellulose), surface-active or dispersing agent. Molded tablets may be
made by molding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered HPPs or HPP
compositions moistened with an inert liquid diluent. Tablets, and other solid dosage
forms, such as dragees, capsules, pills and granules, may optionally be scored or
prepared with coatings and shells, such as enteric coatings and other coatings well
known in the pharmaceutical-formulating art. They may also be formulated so as to
provide slow or controlled         release   of an    HPP therein        using, for example,
hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose in varying proportions to provide the desired release
profile, other polymer matrices, liposomes and/or microspheres. They may be sterilized
by, for example, filtration through a bacteria-retaining filter, or by incorporating sterilizing
agents in the form of sterile solid compositions which can be dissolved in sterile water,
or some other sterile injectable medium immediately before use. These compositions
may also optionally contain pacifying agents and may be of a composition that they
release the HPP(s) only, or preferentially, in a certain portion of the gastrointestinal tract,
optionally, in a delayed manner. Examples of embedding compositions which can be
used include polymeric substances and waxes.             The HPP can also be in micro
encapsulated form, if appropriate, with one or more of the above-described excipients.
[00142]           Liquid dosage forms for oral, transdermal or topical administration
include pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, microemulsions, solutions, suspensions,
syrups and elixirs. In addition to the HPP, the liquid dosage forms may contain inert
diluents commonly used in the art, such as, for example, water or other solvents,
solubilizing agents and emulsifiers, such as ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, ethyl
carbonate, ethyl acetate, benzyl alcohol, benzyl benzoate, propylene glycol, 1,3
butylene glycol, oils (in particular, cottonseed, groundnut, corn, germ, olive, castor and
sesame oils), glycerol, tetrahydrofuryl alcohol, polyethylene glycols and fatty acid esters

                                             81
of sorbitan, and mixtures thereof. Besides inert diluents, the oral compositions can also
include adjuvants such as wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents,
sweetening, flavoring, coloring, perfuming and preservative agents.
[00143]         Suspensions, in addition to the HPP, may contain suspending agents as,
for example, ethoxylated isostearyl alcohols, polyoxyethylene sorbitol and sorbitan
esters, microcrystalline cellulose, aluminum metahydroxide, bentonite, agar-agar and
tragacanth, and mixtures thereof.
[00144]          Formulations for rectal or vaginal administration may be presented as a
suppository, which may be prepared by mixing one or more HPPs with one or more
suitable nonirritating excipients or carriers comprising, for example, cocoa butter,
polyethylene glycol, a suppository wax or a salicylate, and which is solid at room
temperature, but liquid at body temperature and, therefore, will melt in the rectum or
vaginal cavity and release the active agent. Formulations which are suitable for vaginal
administration also include pessaries, tampons, creams, gels, pastes, foams or spray
formulations containing such carriers as are known in the art to be appropriate.
[00145]          Formulations for the topical or transdermal or epidermal or dermal
administration of an HPP composition include powders, sprays, ointments, pastes,
creams, lotions, gels, solutions, patches and inhalants. The active component may be
mixed under sterile conditions with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, and with any
preservatives, buffers, or propellants which may be required.       The ointments, pastes,
creams and gels may contain, in addition to the HPP composition, excipients, such as
animal and vegetable fats, oils, waxes, paraffins, starch, tragacanth, cellulose
derivatives, polyethylene glycols, silicones, bentonites, silicic acid, talc and zinc oxide,
or mixtures thereof. Powders and sprays can contain, in addition to the HPP
composition, excipients such as lactose, talc, silicic acid, aluminum hydroxide, calcium
silicates and polyamide powder, or mixtures of these substances.                Sprays can
additionally contain customary propellants, such as chlorofluorohydrocarbons and
volatile  unsubstituted   hydrocarbons, such as butane          and    propane. The     best
formulations for the topical or transdermal administration are pure water, solution,
aqueous solution, ethanol and water solution, and isopropanol and water solution.

                                             82
[00146]          An HPP or a pharmaceutical composition thereof can be alternatively
administered by aerosol. This can be accomplished by preparing an aqueous aerosol,
liposomal preparation or solid particles containing the HPPs. A nonaqueous (e. g.,
fluorocarbon propellant) suspension could be used. Sonic nebulizers can also be used.
An aqueous aerosol is made by formulating an aqueous solution or suspension of the
agent together with conventional pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and stabilizers.
The carriers and stabilizers vary with the requirements of the particular compound, but
typically include nonionic surfactants (Tweens, Pluronics, or polyethylene glycol),
innocuous proteins like serum albumin, sorbitan esters, oleic acid, lecithin, amino acids
such as glycine, buffers, salts, sugars or sugar alcohols. Aerosols generally are
prepared from isotonic solutions.
[00147]          Transdermal patches can also be used to deliver HPP compositions to a
target site. Such formulations can be made by dissolving or dispersing the agent in the
proper medium. Absorption enhancers can also be used to increase the flux of the HPP
compositionsacross the skin. The rate of such flux can be controlled by either providing
a rate controlling membrane or dispersing the HPP compositionsin a polymer matrix or
gel.
[00148]          Ophthalmic formulations, eye ointments, powders, solutions and the like,
are also contemplated as being within the scope of this invention.
[00149]          Formulations suitable for parenteral administration comprise an HPP in
combination with one or more pharmaceutically-acceptable sterile isotonic aqueous or
nonaqueous solutions, dispersions, suspensions or emulsions, or sterile powders which
may be reconstituted into sterile injectable solutions or dispersions just prior to use,
which may contain antioxidants, buffers, bacterostats, solutes which render the
formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient or suspending or thickening
agents.
[00150]          Examples of suitable aqueous and nonaqueous carriers which may be
employed in the formulations suitable for parenteral administration include water,
ethanol, polyols (e. g., such as glycerol, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, and the
like), and suitable mixtures thereof, vegetable oils, such as olive oil, and injectable

                                             83
organic esters, such as ethyl oleate. Proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by
the use of coating materials, such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required
particle size in the case of dispersions, and by the use of surfactants.
[00151]           Formulations suitable for parenteral administration may also contain
adjuvants such as preservatives, wetting agents, emulsifying agents and dispersing
agents. Prevention of the action of microorganisms may be ensured by the inclusion of
various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, paraben, chlorobutanol, phenol
sorbic acid, and the like. It may also be desirable to include isotonic agents, such as
sugars, sodium chloride, and the like into the compositions.        In addition, prolonged
absorption of the injectable pharmaceutical form may be brought about by the inclusion
of agents which delay absorption such as aluminum monostearate and gelatin.
[00152]           Injectable depot forms are made by forming microencapsule matrices of
an HPP or in biodegradable polymers such as polylactide-polyglycolide. Depending on
the ratio of the HPP to polymer, and the nature of the particular polymer employed, the
rate of drug release can be controlled.       Examples of other biodegradable polymers
include poly (orthoesters) and poly (anhydrides). Depot injectable formulations are also
prepared by entrapping the HPP in liposomes or microemulsions which are compatible
with body tissue.
[00153]           In certain embodiments, one or more HPPs or a pharmaceutical
composition thereof is delivered to an action site in a therapeutically effective dose. As
is known in the art of pharmacology, the precise amount of the pharmaceutically
effective dose of an HPP that will yield the most effective results in terms of efficacy of
treatment in a given patient will depend upon, for example, the activity, the particular
nature, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and bioavailability of a particular HPP,
physiological condition of the subject (including race, age, sex, weight, diet, disease
type and stage, general physical condition, responsiveness to a given dosage and type
of medication), the nature of pharmaceutically acceptable carriers in a formulation, the
route and frequency of administration being used, and the severity or propensity of the
condition that is to be treated. However, the above guidelines can be used as the basis
for fine-tuning the treatment, e. g., determining the optimum dose of administration,
which will require no more than routine experimentation consisting of monitoring the

                                              84
subject and adjusting the dosage. Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy

[00154]          In certain embodiments, a combination of one or more HPPs and/or
other drug(s) is applied to the subject for the desired use (e.g. treatment, screening,
etc.).
[00155]          When applying a combination of a plurality of drugs (e.g. one or more
HPPs and/or other drug(s)) to a subject, each drug may be applied separately, or one or
more of the drugs may be applied at the same time as separate drugs (e.g. spraying
two or more drugs at substantially the same time without mixing the drugs before
spraying), or one or more drugs can be mixed together before applying to the subject, or
any combination of the above application methods. The drugs may be applied in any
order possible.
IV. ADVANTAGES
[00156]           In certain embodiments, since an HPP or HPC of the invention is
capable of crossing one or more biological barriers, the HPP or HPC can be
administered locally (e.g., topically or transdermally) to reach a location where a
condition occurs without the necessity of a systematic administration (e.g., oral or
parenteral administration). A local administration and penetration of an HPP or HPC
allows the HPP or HPC to reach the same level of local concentration of an agent or
drug with much less amount or dosage of HPP or HPC in comparison to a systematic
administration of a parent agent or drug; alternatively, a higher level of local
concentration which may not be afforded in the systematic administration, or if possible,
requires significantly higher dosage of an agent in the systematic administration. The
high local concentration of the HPP/HPC or its parent agent if being cleaved enables
the treatment of a condition more effectively or much faster than a systematically
delivered parent agent and the treatment of new conditions that may not be previously
possible or observed.       The local administration of the HPP or HPC may allow a
biological subject to reduce potential suffering from a systemic administration, e.g.,
adverse    reactions   associated    with   the  systematic   exposure    to  the   agent,
gastrointestinal/renal effects. Additionally, the local administration may allow the HPP

                                             85
or HPC to cross a plurality of biological barriers and reach systematically through, for
example, general circulation and thus avoid the needs for systematic administration
(e.g., injection) and obviate the pain associated with the parenteral injection.
[00157]           In certain embodiments, an HPP/HPC or a pharmaceutical composition
according to the invention can be administered systematically (e.g., orally, transdermally,
or parenterally).    The HPP/HPC or the active agent (e.g., drug or metabolite) of the
HPP/HPC may enter the general circulation with a faster rate than the parent agent and
gain faster access to the action site a condition. Additionally, the HPP/HPC can cross a
biological barrier (e.g., blood brain barrier and blood milk barrier) which has not been
penetrated if a parent agent is administered alone and thus offer novel treatment of
conditions that were be previously possible or observed.

[00184]           Airway responsiveness (transpulmonary resistance (RL) and dynamic
compliance (Cdyn)) to inhaled p-methacholine was determined in mice 3 hours after
the last treatment with test articles and vehicle (treatment started after the final
challenge) at day 21. Animals were anesthetized with ketamine-xylazine,
tracheostomized, and mechanically ventilated within a plethysmograph chamber.
Volume changes due to thoracic expansion and alterations in tracheal pressure were
measured in response to challenge with saline, followed by increasing concentrations of
p-methacholine (6.25, 12.5, 25, and 50 mg/mL). Peak values were taken as the
maximum response to the concentration of methacholine being tested, and were
expressed as the percentage change relative to the saline control. The results are
