    Technical Field
    The invention relates to a multi-component cementitious composition for use as
    back filled grout, a method for the manufacture of hardened cementitious
10  articles based on this multi-component composition as well as the use of a
    sodium silicate solution containing a high concentration of sodium silicate as a
    hardener for cementitious compositions.
    Background of the Invention
15
    Ground blast furnace slag is a by-product of cast iron production starting from
    iron minerals or scrap. In this process a liquid slag forms and floats on the
    molten metal. The main components of blast furnace slag are CaO (30-50
    mass-%), SiO 2 (28-38 mass-%), A12 0 3 (8-24 mass-%) and other oxides such
20  as MgO (usually 1-18 mass-%) which separate from the metal at temperatures
    in excess of 19000C. When this by-product is quickly cooled, a vitreous
    granulate with latent hydraulic properties is obtained.
    The use of granulated blast furnace slag is permitted as a cement component
25  by European standard EN 197-1, type II (Portland slag cement) and Ill (blast
    furnace cement) up to a theoretical slag content of 95%. This high value is
    related to the potential hydraulicity of slag and its activability in cementitious
    mixtures which enable concretes to be produced for particular applications, for
    instance where high durability with low heat development or with lower
30  atmospheric C0 2 -immisions is required.
    Specifically, EN 197-1 requires the following conditions to be satisfied:

   WO 2014/166875                                                     PCT/EP2014/056941
    (CaO+MgO)/SiO 2 > 1; CaO+MgO+SiO 2 > 67% and vitreous mass greater than
    67%.
    Slag activation requires the addition of an activator chosen from alkalis,
 5  sulphates, calcium oxide, or chloride ion-based alkaline salts. Alternatively,
    slag activation can be thermally initiated. The ability to replace Portland cement
    clinker with slag increases with the level of slag activation.
     In general, the reactivity of cements of high slag content is considered to be too
10  mild compared with cements of high clinker content. The high slag content is
    thus aimed at applications in which the typical high activity of clinker would lead
    to excessive overheating of the final concrete article.
     In general, it would be desirable to have cements with high slag content which
15  combine good mechanical characteristics such as in particular high
    compressive strength with quick curing. This property would also extend the
    application of high slag content cements to those sectors in which cements of
    high clinker content are currently used, as well as to structural applications in
    aggressive environments, or to a road, railway or airport construction of large
20  castings or for castings in coastal localities.
     In this regard, US 2012/010331 Al discloses concrete compositions
    comprising blast furnace slag in amounts of up to 95 mass % with blast furnace
    slag fine particles having a fineness of 300-13000 cm 2/g and 5 to 20 parts of
25  gypsum. The concrete mixtures are hardened with an alkaline stimulant such a
    lime, calcium or sodium hydroxide, or Portland cement, from among which
    Portland cement is preferred as it gradually generates calcium hydroxide when
    brought into contact with water. The concrete composition described in US
    2012/010331 Al exhibit compressive strengths of up to 19 MPa after 7 days
30  and up to about 46 MPa after the curing is finished at 28 days.
    US 2012/234109 Al describes a hydraulic binder comprising ground blast
    furnace slag in from 30 % to 90 % by mass of the binder, Portland cement
                                           2

   WO 2014/166875                                                    PCT/EP2014/056941
    clinker in an amount equal to or greater than 5 % by mass of the binder, and a
    sulphate such as CaSO 4 , Na2 SO 4 , K2 SO 4 as the activator. The cement
    composition prepared with such binder/activator combinations exhibit
    compressive strengths of up to 22 MPa after 2 days.
 5
    A special application field, in which blast furnace slags are frequently employed
    as hydraulic binders, are geopolymer compositions. Geopolymer hardening is
    based on the formation of three dimensional aluminumsilicate networks.
    Usually geopolymers are fabricated from mixtures of silicate precursors such
10  as sodiumsilicate and an aluminium source such as calcined bauxite. In
    contrast to cementitious compositions, geopolmers do usually not contain
    regular cement or calciumhydroxide (hydrated lime).
    Geopolymer compositions have for example been described in WO
15  2010/079414 A2, wherein the compositions comprise ground calcite, cotswood
    stone and blast furnace slag as the major ingredients. As explained above,
    these compositions comprise sodium silicate as a solution and calcined bauxite
    as precursors to the formation of the aluminium silicates. The compositions of
    WO 2010/079414 A2 are formulated and cured by addition of small amounts of
20  water, which do not exceed more than 4 wt.-%.
    EP 1 801 084 Al likewise discloses geopolymer compositions comprising
    sodium silicate, fly-ash, blast furnace slag, sodium silicate sulution and a
    mixture of different aggregates as the major ingredients. The compositions of
25  EP 1 801 084 Al were cured by addition of water and sodium hydroxide with
    an overall water amount of about 5 wt.-%, based on the total composition.
    Finally, WO 2005/049522 Al discloses geopolymer concretes comprising 40 to
    60 % of coarse aggregates, 20 to 45 % of sand, 10 to 20% of fly ash and other
30  binder components, 0.5 to 2% of sodium silicate and 0.2 to 0.6 % of sodium
    hydroxide. In the examples of this document a small amount of water was
    added to effect curing, so that the total water content in the composition did not
    exceed about 5 wt.-%.
                                           3

   WO 2014/166875                                                   PCT/EP2014/056941
    As a result of the low amout of water being used for the formulation of
    geopolymers, the polymers usually have very limited flowability and are rather
    perceived as "wet mixes". Therefore, such compositions are not suitable for
 5  applications in which the material has to be injected into a gap between two
    walls, as is necessary for the placement of back filled grouts. For the same
    reason, geopoymers are not suitable for self levelling applications such as e.g.
    for screeds.
10   In some applications it is necessary that the cement exhibits a high early
    strength to allow for workers to cross a cast surface shortly after the casting, or
    to resume their work without having to wait until the cement has fully hardened.
    A suitable compressive strength in this regard is considered to be in excess of
    0.5 MPa, which the cement composition should reach after a short time such
15  as e.g. 2 hours. While the hardening of cement compositions can be
    accelerated by adding higher amounts of hardening agents, this usually leads
    to loss in final properties and short workability.
    One approach to address this problem is a two component composition, in
20  which the hardener is kept separate from the binder components. In this case,
    the binder component should preferably be stable in the absence of the
    hardener, i.e. the binder component including water should not harden or
    phase separate when kept for about 1 d to allow for e.g. safe transport to a
    building site. Once the hardener is mixed with the binder component, the
25  composition should however quickly cure to provide a compressive strength of
    about 0.5 MPa or more after about 2 h.
    As system which comes close to these requirements is currently available on
    the market in the form of grout compositions, which are formulated with a water
30  to binder (W/P) ratio of 1.10 to 3.0 having an ordinary Portland cement content
    of from 300 kg/M 3 to 638 kg/M 3 . These state of the art compositions in addition
    to ordinary Portland cement comprise bentonite clay and retarders and are
    hardened by the addition of 40% sodium silicate solution. While these
                                           4

   WO 2014/166875                                                       PCT/EP2014/056941
    compositions exhibit a suitable workability with gel times of within 4 to 12 s, the
    compositions provide 2 h compressive strengths of below 0.5 MPa.
    There is a need for cementitious compositions which overcome the above
 5  mentioned deficits and in particular provide a 2 h compressive strength of 0.5
    MPa or above and a good workability as expressed by a gel time in the range
    of 10 to 100 seconds. In addition, the binder component, when kept separate
    from the hardener, should preferably be stable for at least 1 day. The present
    application addresses these needs.
10
    Detailed description of the invention
    The present application is directed at cementitious compositions comprising
    ground granulated blast furnace slag which provide high early compressive
15  strengths, in particular compressive strengths after two hours of curing in
    excess of 0.5 mPa.
     In a first aspect, the present application is directed at a multi-component
    cementitious composition with at least a binder and a hardener component,
20  wherein the binder component comprises ground granulated blast furnace slag
    and water and wherein the hardener component comprises a sodium silicate
    solution containing at least 42 wt.-%, preferably at least 45 wt.-% of sodium
    silicate (Na 2 SiO 3 ).
25  Preferably, the multi-component cementitious composition is a two component
    cementitious composition which consists of the mentioned binder and hardener
    component. Thus, if the composition comprises components in addition to the
    ground granulated blast furnace slag, water and the sodium silicate solution,
    these preferably form either constituents of the binder or the hardener
30  component.
     In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the multi-component
    cementitious composition provides a compressive strength after curing for two
                                             5

   WO 2014/166875                                                     PCT/EP2014/056941
    hours of > 0.5 MPa, preferably > 1 MPa and most preferably > 2 MPa. The
    compressive strength as the term is used in the present application means the
    compressive strength as determined according to ASTM 109/C 109M-05 after
    2h of curing at 230C/50 % relative humidity.
 5
    In addition, the multi-component cementitious composition preferably has a gel
    time or from about 10 to about 100 s, preferably from about 10 to 50 s, and
    most preferably in the range of from 10 to 20 s.
10  The ground granulated blast furnace slag employed in the practice of the
    present application is not subject to any relevant restrictions. The slag usually
    comprises CaO (30 to 50 mass-%), SiO 2 (28 to 38 mass-%), A12 0 3 (8 to 24
    mass-%) and MgO (1 to 18 mass-%) as the main components. In general, an
    increased CaO-content of the slag results in a higher slag basicity and
15  compressive strength. The MgO and A12 0 3 content show the same trend up to
    about 10 to 12 and 14%, respectively, beyond which no further improvement is
    observed. The blast furnace slag is preferably ground to provide a specific
    surface area in the rage of 400 to 440 m /kg as determined according to MS
                                                2
    EN 15167-1:2010 or MS EN196-6: 2007 Clause 4.
20
    The content of the ground granulated blast furnace slag in the binder
    component is not subject to relevant restrictions. It is preferred however, that
    the content of this material is in the range of from 12 to 60 wt.-%, preferably 20
    to 60 wt.-%.
25
    The sodium silicate solution further preferably contains 60 wt.-% or less, more
    preferably 50 wt.-% or less of sodium silicate. The most preferred
    concentration in the context of the present invention with regard to the sodium
    silicate is about 47%.
30
    A preferred starting material for preparing a corresponding sodium silicate
    solution is rice husk ash which can simply be dissolved in concentrated sodium
    hydroxide solution. The preparation of such a sodium silicate solution can be
                                            6

   WO 2014/166875                                                        PCT/EP2014/056941
    accomplished by heating the mixture for a time sufficient to completely dissolve
    the rice husk ash and cooling the obtained solution to ambient temperature. In
    some cases, it may be necessary to adjust the concentration to the desired
    range by dilution with water.
 5
    In addition to the mentioned components, the multi-component cementitious
    compositions may further comprise one or more additives selected from
    superplasticizers, retarders, fly ash, lime or hydrated lime, ordinary Portland
    cement and bentonite. These additives preferably also form part of the binder
10  component.
    It is further preferred, that the ratio of water to solids in the binder component is
    in the range of from 0.3 to 1.0, more preferably 0.35 to 0.65, and most
    preferably 0.35 to 0.55. Alternatively, or in addition, it is preferred that the ratio
15  of total water to the combined solids in the basis and hardener component is at
    least 0.3, more preferably in the range of from 0.5 to 0.95, and most preferably
    in the range of from 0.5 to 0.65.
    Alternatively, or in addition, it is preferred that the ratio of the total solids in the
20  binder component to the total solids in the hardener component is in the range
    of 2.5 : 1 to 6 : 1 and more preferably 4.7 : 1 to 5.6 : 1, and even more
    preferably 4.82 : 1 to 5.55 : 1.
    As is stated above, the multi-component cementitious composition may
25  comprise ordinary Portland cement in addition to granulated blast furnace slag.
    Portland cement is the most common type of cement. This cement is generally
    in use around the world, because it is a basic ingredient of concrete, water,
    stucco and most non-speciality grout. It is a fine powder produced by grinding
    Portland cement clinker (99%) with a limited amount of calcium sulphate which
30  controls the set time, and up to 5% minor constituents as defined by the
    European standard EN 197.1.
                                              7

   WO 2014/166875                                                    PCT/EP2014/056941
    A preferred Portland cement for use in the practice of the present application is
    white cement, such as white cement E52:5 and E-42.5R. White cement is a
    Portland cement with a low iron oxide content. It is similar to ordinary, grey
    Portland cement except for its highly degree of whiteness.
 5
     If the composition contains ordinary Portland cement, the cement is preferably
    also a part of the binder component. In this case, the content of the ordinary
    Portland cement relative to the total weight of the binder component is 10 to 60
    wt.-%, preferably 30 to 55 wt.-%, and most preferably 35 to 45 wt.-%. In
10  addition, it is preferred that the ground granulated blast furnace slag is present
    in the binder component in 10 to 60 wt.-%, preferably 20 to 35 wt.-%. The
    weight ratio of the ordinary Portland cement to the ground granulated blast
    furnace slag is suitably in the range of from 2:1 to 1:5, preferably 1:1 to 1:4.
15  The water to solid ratio (as calculated on the respective weights) in the above
    described cement compositions is preferably in the range of from 1 to 0.3,
    preferably 0.7 to 0.4 and most preferably about 0.5.
     In another preferred embodiment of the present application, the multi
20  component cementitious composition is substantially free of ordinary Portland
    cement. "Substantially free" as this term is used above means that the
    composition comprises less than 5 % by weight of ordinary Portland cement,
    preferably less than 2 % by weight, more preferably less than 1 % weight and
    most preferably less than 0.1 % by weight of ordinary Portland cement. In this
25  case the composition may comprise further solid materials such as in particular
    hydrated lime or lime and optionally fly ash.
    Fly ash, also known as flue-ash, is one of the residues generated in
    combustion, and comprises the fine particles that rise with the flue gases. In an
30  industrial context, fly ash usually refers to ash produced during combustion of
    coal. Fly ash is usually recovered from the flue gases by electrostatic
    precipitators or other particle filtration equipment before the gases reach the
    chimneys of coal-fired power plants. Depending on the source and makeup of
                                              8

   WO 2014/166875                                                      PCT/EP2014/056941
    the coal being burned, the components of fly ash vary considerably, but all fly
    ash includes substantial amounts of silicon dioxide (SiO 2 ) (both amorphous
    and crystalline) and calcium oxide (CaO), both being endemic ingredients in
    many coal-bearing rock strata.
 5
    The best results in terms of high early strength were observed in cementitious
    compositions not comprising fly ash. Thus, compositions comprising ground
    granulated blast furnace slag in addition to lime or hydrated lime are preferred
    over those which in addition comprise fly ash.
10
    The amount of hydrated lime in the above compositions is preferably in the
    range of 8 to 20 wt.-%, relative to the total weight of the binder component,
    more preferably 10 to 15 wt.-%.
15  The water to solid ratio (as calculated on the respective weights) in the above
    described cement compositions is preferably in the range of from 1 to 0.3,
    preferably 0.8 to 0.4 and most preferably about 0.6 to 0.4.
    In the practice of the present application, it is further preferred that the multi
20  component cementitious composition has a water to binder ratio (W/B) in the
    range of from 0.6 to 1, preferably from 0.62 to 0.8. The water amount in this
    ratio is the combined amount of water from each of the components. The
    binder is intended to mean the inorganic solid components of the composition,
    i.e., the ground granulated blast furnace slag and, if present, fly ash, hydrated
25  lime, ordinary Portland cement and bentonite.
    Bentonite can be added to the multi-component cementitious composition of
    the present application as a rheology modifier or thixotropic agent. The
    preferred amount of this additive in the multi-component cementitious
30  composition is in the range of 2 to 0.001 wt.-%, more preferably 1 to 0.01 wt.-%
    and most preferably 0.5 to 0.05 wt.-%, based on the total weight of the
    composition.

   WO 2014/166875                                                      PCT/EP2014/056941
    The superplasticiser of the present application is preferably a polycarboxylate
    and even more preferably a polycarboxylate ether. Such polymers are
    produced e.g. by radical copolymerisation of (meth)acrylic acid and
    polyalkylene glycol-isoprenyl ether (IPEG) having a molecular weight Mw in the
 5  range of from about 1000 to 3000 g/mol, preferably 2000 to 2700 g/mol with a
    number of alkylene glycol units present in the polyalkylene glycol isoprenyl
    ether in the range of about 30 to 80 and preferably 45 to 65. The molecular
    weight in the practice of the present application means the molecular weight as
    determined by GPC, unless otherwise indicated.
10
    Other polycarboxylate ether superplasticizers are obtainable from partial
    esterification of poly(meth)acrylic acid and alkylpolyoxyalkylene alcohols.
    The resulting polymer is essentially random as concerns the distribution of
15  (meth)acrylic acid and polyalkylene glycol isoprenyl ether or polyalkylene glycol
    acrylate ester units. The molar ratio of acid to polyalkylene glycol monomer
    units is preferably in the range of 2 : 1 to 15 : 1, preferably 3 : 1 to 4 : 1.
    In the practice of the present application it is further preferred that the
20  superplasticizer is included into the multi-component cementitious composition
    in amounts of from 2 to 0.001 wt.-%, more preferably of from 1 to 0.01 wt.-%
    and most preferably of from 0.5 to 0.05 wt.-%. While the superplasticizer may
    in principle be added to either component of the multi-component cementitious
    composition, it is preferred that it is added to the binder component, as this
25  increases the stability of the binder component.
    As a retarder it is possible to use conventional retarders known in the art for
    cement compositions. Suitable retarders include lignosulfonates, alkaliborates
    and organophosphonates as well as oligosaccharides. A particularly suitable
30  retader for use in the present application is sugarcane molasses, preferably
    with a solids content in the range of 30 to 35 %.

    The amount of retarder used in the cementitious composition of the present
    invention is not particularly limited. Preferred amounts of this ingredient range
    from 2 to 0.001 wt.-%, more preferably of from 1 to 0.01 wt.-% and most
    preferably of from 0.5 to 0.05 wt.-%.
 5
    A further aspect of the present application is the use of a multi-component
    cementitious composition as described above as a mortar or grout material.
    Exemplary applications for the inventive mortars and grouts include masonry
    mortar e.g. for the construction of brickwork, plaster, e.g. for plastering walls
10  and ceilings, fire protection mortar, grouts for joint filling and screed mortars
    and grouts. Preferably, the multi-component cementitious composition is used
    either as a screed mortar of back filled grout.
    A yet further aspect of the present application is the use of a sodium silicate
15  solution containing at least 42 wt.-% of sodium silicate as a hardener for a
    cementitious composition. The preferred embodiments as discussed above for
    the multi-component cementitious composition in relation to the sodium silicate
    solution apply likewise to this use.
20   In a further aspect, the present application is directed at a method for the
    manufacture of a hardened cementitious article comprising

 5  Examples
     In the following investigations, the ground granulated blast furnace slag
    (GGBS), fly ash, ordinary Portland cement (OPC), bentonite, polycarboxylate
    ether superplasticizer (PCE; 45% solution in water) water and retarder (sugar
10  cane molasse at a concentration of 30 to 35% in water) were formulated as the
    component A (binder component).
    The hardener component is designated as component B and contained
    extracted sodium silicate solution (47 mass-%) from rice husk ash for the
15  inventive Examples or industrial sodium silicate solution (40 mass-%) for the
    comparative Examples. The industrial sodium silicate solution was obtained
    from Taiko Sdn Bhd.
    The extracted sodium silicate from rice husk ash was prepared as follows:
20
    307.28 g sodium hydroxide was loaded into a stainless steel vessel containing
    531.4 g water and the slurry was thoroughly mixed. The temperature was then
    raised to 70 to 800C by heating. Then, 288 g rice husk ash was added over a
    period of 2 h. After 2h of heating at 70 to 800C, the rice husk ash was
25  completely dissolved and the mixture was subsequently cooled to ambient
    temperature. The solution was finally adjusted to a solids content of about
    47%.
    The cement water mixtures were prepared as follows:
30  First, all raw materials of component A were mixed homogeneously in a vessel
    with an adjustable speed hand mixer at 150 to 300 rpm to form a free flowing
    slurry. To this slurry, the component B was added while mixing at high speed
    with the hand-mixer for 3 s and the mixture was then transferred into three 50 x
                                            12

   WO 2014/166875                                                 PCT/EP2014/056941
    50 x 50 mm cubes for 3 s. The mold cubes were cured at 270C to 300C while
    covered with a plastic sheet.
    In the following W/B designates the mass ratio of water to binder. The
 5  compressive strength was determined according to ASTM C 109/Cl 09M-05 by
    crushing a test cube hardened for 2h to determine the compressive strength.
    The gel time was determined as the time it takes to form a non-flowable or non
    pourable soft gel from a fresh mixture.
10  Comparative Examples 1 to 4
    These Examples were prepared as described above with sodium silicate 40%
    solution from Taiko Sdn Bhd in ratios of component A to component B in the
    range of 10.42 to 8.21. All Comparative Examples exhibited a compressive
15  strength after 2h in the range of from 0.35 mPa to 0.45 mPa with gel times in
    the range of 4 to 12 s.
