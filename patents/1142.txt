PRESSURISED FLUID DRIVEN DIAPHRAGM PUMP ASSEMBLY
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION
[0001] The content of Australian Patent Application No. 2014387814 is incorporated herein by
reference in its entirety.
FIELD
[0002] The present invention relates to pump assemblies and more particularly but not
exclusively to pump assemblies that include an air motor portion that drives a pump portion of
the assembly.
BACKGROUND
[0003] Diaphragm pumps include a chamber that is divided by a piston and diaphragm so as to
provide a first sub-chamber that receives a working fluid (liquid or gas) under pressure, and a
second sub-chamber that receives a fluid being pumped. Usually the working fluid is
compressed air. The working fluid under pressure is delivered to the first sub-chamber to cause
reciprocation of the piston and diaphragm to vary the volume of the second sub-chamber, and
thereby pump the fluid to be pumped by the assembly. These diaphragm pumps have an inlet
and an outlet that communicate with the second sub-chamber via one-way valves so that the
fluid being pumped passes in a predetermined direction through the pump assembly. A first
manifold joins the inlet with the second sub-chamber while a second manifold joins the second
sub-chamber with the outlet.
[0004] The above pump assemblies include a first body part providing the second sub-chamber,
and a second body part providing the first sub-chamber. The first part provides for mounting of
the one-way valves, while the diaphragm is held in position by being secured between the first
and second body parts.
[0005] A disadvantage of the above described pump assemblies is that first part is generally an
assembly and therefore requires gaskets, seals and securing means for its assembly. The
disadvantage in that the construction is complex and time in respect of construction. This adds
considerably to the cost of the pump assembly.

                                                   2
[0006] A further disadvantage of the above pump assemblies is resistance to flow of the pump
fluid through the pump assembly.
[0007] A further disadvantage of the above assemblies is at least one of the pump parts have
embedded in them bolts that protrude and are engaged by the other pump part. The use of these
bolts inhibits efficient moulding of the pump parts.
[0008] Described in USA Patents 5564911 and 6834678, and International Patent Applications
PCT/AU2009/000199, PCT/AU2011/000226 and PCT/AU2014/000151 are pump assemblies
relating to the present invention.
OBJECT
[0009] It is the object of the present invention to overcome or at least substantially ameliorate
against one of the above disadvantages.

DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS
[0025] In the accompanying drawings there is schematically depicted a pump assembly 10. The
pump assembly 10 is provided with compressed air, that acts as a driving fluid, to drive the
pump assembly 10 to pump a liquid. The pump assembly 10 includes a pair of chambers 11 and
12, with each of the chambers 11 and 12 being divided into sub-chambers 13, 14 and 15, 16. A
first piston assembly 17 divides the chamber 11 into sub-chambers 13 and 14, while a second
piston assembly 18 divides the chamber 12 into sub-chambers 15 and 16.

                                                5
[0026] Compressed air is alternately delivered to the chambers 14 and 16 by a valve assembly
19. The valve assembly 19 may be a valve assembly as described in the International Patent
Applications mentioned above.
[0027] The compressed air delivered to the sub-chambers 14 and 16 causes the piston
assemblies 17 and 18 to reciprocate linearly along the longitudinal axis 20 of a connecting rod
21. The connecting rod 21 couples the piston assemblies 17 and 18 so that the piston assemblies
17 and 18 reciprocate in unison.
[0028] Movement of the piston assemblies 17 and 18 varies the volume of the sub-chambers 13
and 15, to pump the liquid being delivered to the pump assembly 10.
[0029] The pump assembly 10 includes a body 22, with the body 22 providing first body parts
23 that surround the sub-chambers 13, and second body parts 24 that surround the sub-chambers
14 and 16. Each of the body parts 23 and 24 is moulded from plastics material. Each of the
parts 23 provides a chamber body portion 25 that is essentially of an annular construction.
[0030] Mounted in each part 23, or integrally formed therewith, is a pair of valve seats 26 and
27. The valve seats 26 and 27 provide for the flow of liquid through the sub-chamber 13.
[0031] Each first part 23 includes a duct body portion 28 that is integrally formed with the
adjacent chamber portion 25. Preferably the associated portions are integrally formed by being
injection moulded.
[0032] Mounted in each first part 23 is a one-way inlet valve 64 including a movable valve 41
that pivots between an open and closed position with respect to the associated valve seat 26.
Also mounted in each first part 23 is a one-way outlet valve 65 including a movable valve
member 42 that pivots between an open and closed position with respect to the associated valve
seat 27. The valve members 41 and 42 are moved between their open and closed positions by
the flow of liquid through the pump assembly 10.
[0033] Providing an inlet duct 43 is an inlet manifold assembly 44 that receives the liquid being
pumped via an inlet aperture 45. The duct 43 communicates with the duct portions 29.

                                                  6
[0034] Connected to the duct portion 28 is an exhaust manifold assembly 60 that receives the
liquid being pumped from the chambers 13 and 15 and delivers the liquid to an outlet aperture
61. The assembly 60 provides an outlet duct 66.
[0035] Each piston assembly 17 and 18 includes a piston body 46 to which there is fixed a
diaphragm 47, with the outer peripheral edges of each diaphragm 47 being clamped between
adjacent portions of the first and second parts 23, 24.
[0036] The first parts 23, as mentioned previously, are each integrally formed from plastics
material, more preferably are injected moulded from plastics material.
[0037] The first parts 23 are provided with an annular flange 48 that is provided with a plurality
of passages 49 that are aligned with corresponding passages in the adjacent second part 24 so
that threaded fasteners may pass through the aligned passages and tensioned to secure each first
part 23 to its adjacent second part 24.
[0038] Each duct portion 28 is provided with a part generally square or rectangular flange 50,
with each flange 50 being moulded with a plurality of passages 51 to be aligned with
corresponding passages in the adjacent manifold portions 52 and 62 (provided by the manifold
assemblies 44 and 60), with threaded fasteners passing through the aligned passages that are
tensioned to secure the manifold portions 52 and 62 to the duct portions 28.
[0039] Each duct body portion 28 provides a duct inlet length 29 and a duct outlet length 30.
[0040] Each length 29 and 30 has a generally central longitudinal axis, inclined to a plane
through the valve seats 26 and 27, by an acute angle 34 or 39.
[0041] As best seen in Figure 4, the pump assembly 10 includes a pair of mountings 67. The
mountings 67 ensure that the pump assembly 10 is supported so that the valve seats 26 and 27
are located in substantially vertical planes. This in combination with the inclination of duct
portions 29 and 30, ensure that the pump liquid entering and leaving the sub-chamber 13 passes
in a substantially horizontal direction.
[0042] The valves 64 are above the valves 56, accordingly flow through the sub-chambers 13
and15 is downward.

                                                    7
[0043] It should also be noted that each valve seat 27 is located in a substantially vertical plane
that is positioned closer to the associated piston assembly 17, 18 than a substantially vertical
plane within which the adjacent valve seat 26 is located.
[0044] The above described preferred embodiments have a number of advantages including the
following:
[0045] (1)      The first parts 23 are integrally formed from plastics material, thereby
                eliminating a significant number of seals and gaskets. This not only reduces the
                risk of leaks, but reduces assembly costs;
[0046] (2)      The duct portions 29 and 30 are inclined by acute angles 34 and 39 to the valve
                seats 26, 27, enhancing flow to and from the sub-chambers 13 and 15;
[0047] (3)      The first and second parts 23, 24, are provided with aligned passages 49 through
                which threaded fasteners pass to secure the parts 23 and 24 together. The same
                applies to the passages 51, of the parts 23, that are aligned with passages in the
                manifold portions 52 and 62 so that the threaded fasteners can pass therethrough
                to secure the portions 52 and 62 to the parts 23. By eliminating embedding of
                bolts in the moulded parts, the parts are more easily moulded;
[0048] (4)      Each chamber body portion 25 is moulded with passages 63 through which bolts
                pass to secure each of the valves 64 in position. This enables more efficient
                moulding; and
[0049] (5)      As the duct portions 29 and 30 and valves 26 and 27 are positioned and
                configured to ensure that the pump liquid entering and leaving the sub-chambers
                 13 is generally horizontal, fluid flow through the sub-chambers 13 is enhanced.
