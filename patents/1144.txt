TECHNICAL FIELD
[0001]       The present invention relates to gas stoves and more particularly refers to a portable
explosion-resistant gas stove.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
[0002]       Any discussion of the prior art throughout the specification should in no way be
considered as an admission that such prior art is widely known or forms part of common
general knowledge in the field.
[0003]       In the prior art ordinary gas stoves are used for cooking or baking with trays, flame
zones of their burners and the trays will overheat because distance between their burners and
gas cartridges is too short and outer diameter of their wind-shield ring is too small. The heat
transfers to gas cartridges through casings and gas cartridge compartment lids and overheats
gas cartridges consequently, which will trigger safety device to unlock the gas cartridges.
Although gas cartridges are unlocked, they, overheated by heat from flame zones and baking
trays, still have the possibility of explosion, which is extremely dangerous.
[0004]       ZL201420766905.5 discloses a portable gas stove which comprises a top panel, a
burner, a knob, pan supports, a wind-shield ring, a bottom panel, a separating plate, a back
panel, a front panel, a gas cartridge, a regulator, a temperature sensor, an ignition needle, a
thermal conductive plate and a fluid holder. Said burner is mounted on the bottom panel; said
pan supports and wind-shield ring are disposed on the fluid holder; said fluid holder is installed
on the top panel; said gas cartridge is connected to the regulator; said separating plate is
attached to the top; front and back panels; said regulator is fixed on the separating plate; said
knob is installed on the regulator; there are heat dissipation holes on both top and back panels;
said ignition needle is positioned beneath the burner; said temperature sensor is disposed on
the bottom panel and said thermal conductive plate is connected to the burner. However,
ZL201420766905.5 does not disclose the shortest distance between said burner and ignition
means, so it is impossible to guarantee that gas stoves manufactured in accordance with it
have the lowest cost. In addition, although there are heat dissipation holes on gas cartridge
compartment lid according to ZL201420766905.5, there is no detailed description about their
size, shape, location and heat dissipation performance. By reference to attached drawings,
heat dissipation holes will have poor performance if they are disposed in the side wall of the

                                                  -2
gas cartridge compartment lid. In addition, ZL201420766905.5 does not disclose any structure
or method of any thermal insulation and/or cooling elements other than the heat dissipation
holes. In conclusion, the gas stove disclosed by ZL201420766905.5 cannot save cost for
manufacturers or dissipate heat effectively.
[0005]     Pursuant to new EU standard, temperature of the gas cartridge shall not exceed
500C after a gas stove is used for 90 minutes. Therefore, it is very important to design a gas
stove, a portable gas stove with lower manufacturing cost and better thermal insulation and/or
heat dissipation effects which meet international standard.
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
[0006]     It is an object of the present invention to overcome or ameliorate at least one of the
disadvantages of the prior art, or to provide a useful alternative.
[0007]     The purpose of the present invention is to provide a portable explosion-resistant gas
stove which is safer and has better thermal insulation and/or heat dissipation effects and can

lid.
[0014]     It is preferred that said thermal insulation and/or cooling elements include heat
dissipation openings on the top of said gas cartridge compartment lid.
[0015]     It is preferred that said heat dissipation openings on the top of said gas cartridge
compartment lid are in the shape of holes or gratings.
[0016]     It is preferred that said thermal insulation and/or cooling elements include elongated
heat dissipation openings disposed through the side wall of said cartridge compartment lid
allowing upward air flow.
[0017]     This invention protects a portable explosion-resistant gas stove comprising a casing,

area of these openings is 6750mm 2 . Said thermal insulation pad is 185mm long, 50mm wide
and 0.1mm thick and is made up of aluminium foil.
[0018]     This invention has following advantages: the present invention is more suitable to be
used outdoors, especially on the beach, since it has a one-piece bottom panel without any
opening to avoid other things entering the gas stove; the shortest distance between the burner
and the gas cartridge holder not only saves cost but also results in a smaller gas stove which
is easier to carry; comparing to existing art regarding gas stoves, this invention has more heat
dissipation openings and larger total heat dissipation area; furthermore, heat dissipation

cartridge 11 will be delivered to the burner 2 through a gas supply pipe 25, finally spark from
ignition needle 14 will ignite the gas.
[0043]     Referring to Figure 3 which illustrates an embodiment of the present invention with a
gas cartridge compartment lid 20. The gas cartridge compartment lid 20 covers outside the gas
cartridge 11 to define a closed gas cartridge compartment. There are thermal insulation and/or
cooling elements, namely elongated heat dissipation openings 18, on the gas cartridge
compartment lid 20. In this embodiment, the elongated heat dissipation openings 18 are
gratings being perpendicular to and extending onto the top of the gas cartridge compartment
lid 20. Each said grating is 64.5mm long and 9mm wide so as to prevent users' fingers from
reaching into the gas cartridge compartment, and total area of the gratings is 6750mm 2 . In
order to avoid food or other things dropping into the gas cartridge compartment when the gas
stove is in use, the heat dissipation openings on the top of the gas cartridge compartment lid
should not extend too much.
[0044]     The elongated heat dissipation openings 18 are reinforced by reinforcing ridges 26 to
avoid deformation during operation.

avoid deformation during operation.
[0050]     Meanwhile, thermal insulation and/or cooling elements in the embodiment also
include a thermal insulation pad 21 disposed on an underside surface of the top of the gas
cartridge compartment lid because heat from the burner 2 will flow into the gas cartridge
compartment through the compartment lid and cause the compartment temperature to rise.
With a total area of 9250mm 2 , said thermal insulation pad 21 is made from thermal insulation
material such as aluminium, tin, plastic, marble, asbestos, etc. and is 185mm long, 50mm wide
and 0.1mm thick.

of heat dissipation elements of an embodiment of the present invention. In the embodiment,
the gas stove includes a gas cartridge compartment lid 20. The gas cartridge compartment lid
20 covers outside the gas cartridge 11 to define a closed gas cartridge compartment. There
are thermal insulation and/or cooling elements, namely elongated heat dissipation openings
18, on the gas cartridge compartment lid 20. In the embodiment, the elongated heat dissipation
openings 18 are gratings being perpendicular to and extending onto the top of the gas
cartridge compartment lid 20. Every said grating is 64.5mm long and 9mm wide and total area

                                                -9
[0053]    The elongated heat dissipation openings 18 are reinforced by reinforcing ridges 26 to
avoid deformation during operation.
[0054]     In addition, the thermal insulation and/or cooling elements in the embodiment also
comprise heat dissipation holes on gas cartridge compartment lid top 23. Said heat dissipation
holes 23 are circular and diameter of each hole is 2mm. They are in the shape of holes to
prevent other things dropping into the compartment through them. Otherwise, the whole lid top
can be hollowed-out.
[0055]     Referring to Figure 9 which illustrates a schematic view of the structure and position
of heat dissipation elements of another embodiment of the present invention. In the
embodiment, the gas stove includes a gas cartridge compartment lid 20. The gas cartridge
compartment lid 20 covers outside the gas cartridge 11 to define a closed gas cartridge
compartment. There are thermal insulation and/or cooling elements, namely elongated heat
dissipation openings 18, on the gas cartridge compartment lid 20. In the embodiment, the
elongated heat dissipation openings 18 are gratings being perpendicular to and extending onto
the top of the gas cartridge compartment lid 20. Every said grating is 64.5mm long and 9mm
wide and total area of the gratings is 6750mm 2 . In order to avoid food or other things dropping
into the gas cartridge compartment when the gas stove is in use, the heat dissipation openings
on the top of the gas cartridge compartment lid should not extend too much. The elongated
heat dissipation openings 18 are reinforced by reinforcing ridges 26 to avoid deformation
during operation.

comprise heat dissipation gratings through gas cartridge compartment lid top 24. Each of said
heat dissipation gratings 24 is 30mm long and 2mm wide. They are in the shape of gratings to
prevent other things dropping into the compartment through them. Otherwise, the whole lid top
can be hollowed-out.
[0057]     Referring to Figure 10 which illustrates a plan view of the present invention with a
gas cartridge installed and the gas cartridge compartment lid is open. Following tests have
been conducted to measure temperature of the front of the gas cartridge upper surface 11 a,
the middle of the gas cartridge upper surface 11 b, the back of the gas cartridge upper surface
11 c and the middle of the gas cartridge lower surface 11d when the gas stove is in operation.
Embodiments illustrated in figurel-9 are based on but not limited to results of the following
tests.

                                              -10
           Test 1
[0058]     Test subject: the subject of test 1 is an embodiment of the present invention. The
embodiment is a gas stove which has shorter heat dissipation openings on its gas cartridge
compartment lid and no thermal insulation pad 21 and the distance between its burner center
and gas cartridge compartment center a is 149mm. A 350 x 350 x 10mm iron plate is used as a
cooking tray. Test method: put the gas stove on a test table and insert a gas cartridge 11.
Connect an automatic balance recording meter to the front of the gas cartridge upper surface
11 a, the middle of the gas cartridge upper surface 11 b, the back of the gas cartridge upper
surface 11 c and the middle of the gas cartridge lower surface 11d. Measure and record their
initial temperatures. Ignite the burner 2 and put the 350 X 350 X 10mm iron plate onto pan
supports 4. Record temperatures of the above four positions every minute. The test lasts for
about an hour and a half. During the test, indoor temperature is 260C, humidity is 41% and
barometric pressure is 101 Ohpa. The test is repeated five times.
[0059]     According to Figure 11 which shows results of the test, temperature of the middle of
the gas cartridge lower surface 11d is far lower than those of the other three positions and it
does not rise as cooking proceeds. However, it will be influenced when the whole gas cartridge
is overheated. Therefore, it shows that heat which causes the gas cartridge 11 to overheat
transfers through the upper surface of the gas cartridge 11. The other three curves of the front
of the gas cartridge upper surface 11 a, the middle of the gas cartridge upper surface 11 b and
the back of the gas cartridge upper surface 11 c show that temperature of the gas cartridge
upper surface rises gradually as the cooking proceeds. In particular, temperature of the middle
of the gas cartridge upper surface 11 b reaches up to 51.3  0C at 91 minutes.
           Test 2
[0060]     Test subject: the subject of test 2 is an embodiment of the present invention. The
embodiment is a gas stove which has elongated heat dissipation openings on its gas cartridge
compartment lid and the distance between its burner center and gas cartridge compartment
center is 169mm. A 350x350x10mm iron plate is used as a cooking tray. Test method: put the
gas stove on a test table and insert a gas cartridge 11. The gas stove is 697mm from the
ground and pressure of the gas cartridge is 630mmH 20. Connect an automatic balance
recording meter to the middle of the gas cartridge upper surface 11 b. Measure and record its
initial temperature. Ignite the burner 2 and put the 350x350x10mm iron plate onto the pan
supports 4. Record temperature of the middle of the gas cartridge upper surface 11b every

                                              - 11
minute. The test lasts for about an hour and a half. The initial temperature of the gas cartridge
is 220C. During the test, indoor temperature is 270C, humidity is 34% and barometric pressure
is 1025hpa. The test is repeated five times.
[0061]     According to Figure 12 which shows results of the test, temperature of the gas
cartridge upper surface gradually rises as cooking proceeds and it surpasses 500C after 76
minutes.
           Test 3
[0062]     Test subject: the subject of test 3 is an embodiment of the present invention. The
embodiment is a gas stove which has elongated heat dissipation openings on its gas cartridge
compartment lid and the distance between its burner center and gas cartridge compartment
center a is 179mm. A 350x350x10mm iron plate is used as a cooking tray. Test method: put
the gas stove on a test table and insert a gas cartridge 11. The gas stove is 697mm from the
ground and pressure of the gas cartridge is 630mmH 20. Connect an automatic balance
recording meter to the middle of the gas cartridge upper surface 11 b. Measure and record its
initial temperature. Ignite the burner 2 and put the 350x350x10mm iron plate onto the pan
supports 4. Record temperature of the middle of the gas cartridge upper surface 11b every
minute. The test lasts for about an hour and a half. The initial temperature of the gas cartridge
is 220C. During the test, indoor temperature is 250C, humidity is 30% and barometric pressure
is 1025hpa. The test is repeated five times.
[0063]     According to Figure 13 which shows results of the test, temperature of the gas
cartridge upper surface gradually rises as cooking proceeds. But it doesn't surpass 500C after
84 minutes. Therefore, 179mm is the best distance between the burner center and gas
cartridge compartment center.
           Test 4
[0064]     Test subject: the subject of test 4 is an embodiment of the present invention. The
embodiment is a gas stove which has shorter heat dissipation openings on its gas cartridge
compartment lid and no thermal insulation pad 21 or heat dissipation openings on the side
