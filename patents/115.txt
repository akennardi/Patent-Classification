                                                     BACKGROUND
       [0001]              Many grocery goods, such as egg cartons, are shipped to stores in cardboard
             boxes. The goods are unloaded at the store and placed on shelves, such as refrigerator
             shelves. Unloading the goods requires extra labor and the cardboard sometimes is not
             recycled.
       [0002]              Some reusable plastic collapsible containers full of goods for sale can be placed
             directly onto the shelves. The consumers remove the product directly from the reusable
             container. The container may be a collapsible container, such that the walls of the
             container can be collapsed when empty, for efficient storage and transport.
                                                       SUMMARY
       [0003]              A container includes a base and a wall secured to the base and movable between
             an upright position and a collapsed position on the base. The wall including a recess and
             a pair of pins projecting into the recess. A hinge member is pivotably secured to the
             pins in the recess in the wall. The hinge member includes a pair of opposed bases
             connected by a plurality of curved walls. The bases each include an aperture receiving
             one of the pair of pins in the recess.
       [0004]              In one embodiment, the hinge member pivotably secured the wall to another
             wall such that the wall can pivot 270 degrees to leave that side of the container
             completely open.
       [0005]              In another embodiment, the hinge member pivotably secures the wall to the
             base.

                           DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT
       [0027]              A collapsible container 10 isshown in Figure 1. The container 10 includes a base
             12, first and second side walls 14, 15, rear wall 16 and front wall 18, each molded as a
             separate piece of plastic, such as by injection molding. The side walls 14, 15 and rear
             wall 16 are pivotably connected to the base 12 such that they can be collapsed onto the
             base 12 when empty to reduce volume for shipping and storing empty containers.
             Latches (not illustrated) selectively connect the side walls 14, 15 to the rear wall 16 and
             would selectively connect second side wall 15 to one edge of the front wall 18.
       [0028]              The other edge of the front wall 18 is connected to the first side wall 14 via
             hinges 24. Each hinge 24 includes a hinge member 30 connecting the first side wall 14
             to the front wall 18. The front wall 18 is not connected to the base 12 by hinges as are
             the other walls 14, 15, 16.
       [0029]              The side walls 14, 15 include handle openings 20 offset from center. The handle
             opening 20 on the first side wall 14 is offset toward the front wall 18. The handle
             opening 20 on the second side wall 15 is offset toward the rear wall 16. The rear and
             front walls 16, 18 include handle openings 22, which in this example are centered on
             rear and front walls 16, 18.
       [0030]              Referring to Figure 2, after releasing a latch (not shown) connecting the front
             wall 18 to the second side wall 15, the front wall 18 can be pivoted about the hinges 24
             that connect it to the first side wall 14. The front wall 18 can be pivoted approximately
             270 degrees to a retracted position where it abuts the outer surface of the first side wall
             14 as shown. In this position, the handle opening 22 through the front wall 18 aligns
             with the handle opening 20 through the first side wall 14. This facilitates use of the
             handle openings 20, 22 when the front wall 18 is in this retracted position. In this
             position, customers can fully access the contents of the container 10 through the front
             of the container 10, i.e. there are no projections from the front edges of the side walls
             14, 15 that would reduce the dimensions of the front opening of the container 10, i.e.
             the dimension of the front opening is the same as the dimension between the center of
             the side walls 14, 15. This facilitates removal of the goods (such as egg cartons) from

                                                            4
             the container 10 by the consumer. Optionally, another latch can secure the front wall
             18 in this retracted position to the first side wall 14.
       [0031]              Figures 3-6 show the steps of pivoting the front wall 18 from the closed position
             (Figure 3) to the retracted position (Figure 6).
       [0032]              When empty, the container 10 can be collapsed as shown in Figure 7. The front
             wall 18 is moved to the retracted position (Figure 2; if not already there). The second
             side wall 15 is collapsed onto the base 12. The first side wall 14 and attached front wall
             18 are then pivoted down onto the second side wall 15. The rear wall 16 is then pivoted
             onto the first side wall 14, but preferably is adjacent to, not on top of, the front wall 18
             to reduce the overall height. In the collapsed position, the container 10 occupies very
             little volume and can be shipped back to the warehouse or central location for reloading
             with goods for sale.
       [0033]              Figure 8 is an enlarged view of one of the hinges 24 of the container of Figure 1,
             with the hinge member 30 removed for illustration. As shown, the hinge area includes a
             notch or recess 32 in the side edge of the front wall 18 and an aligned notch or recess 34
             in the front edge of the first side wall 14. Each recess 32, 34 includes a pair of vertical
             pins 36, one projecting upward and one projecting downward toward one another and
             axially aligned with one another.
       [0034]              Figure 9 shows the hinge area of Figure 8 with the hinge member 30 in place.
             The hinge member 30 is partially received in the recess 32 in the front wall 18 and
             partially received in the recess 34 in the first side wall 14. The hinge member 30 is
             connected to the front wall 18 by the pair of vertical pins 36 (one shown) and is
             connected to the side wall 14 by the pair of vertical pins 36 (one shown). The hinge
             member 30 provides a double hinge (two axes of rotation) that permits the front wall 18
             to pivot approximately 270 degrees.
       [0035]              Figure 10 is a perspective view of the hinge member 30. The hinge member 30
             may be injection molded as a single piece of HDPE or other suitable material. The hinge
             member 30 is symmetrical about its long axis and about an axis perpendicular to the
             long axis. The hinge member 30 includes a pair of bases 40 at opposite ends. Each base

             40 has a pair of apertures 42 formed therein. Outer walls 44 extend from outer edges of
             each base 40 toward the outer walls 44 of the other base 40. Curved walls 46 curve
             inward from the outer walls 44 then curve back to a single center wall 48. The curved
             walls 46 provide the flexibility to the hinge member 30 sufficient to install the hinge
             member 30 onto the vertical pins 36 of the walls 14, 18 (Figure 9), such as by squeezing
             the bases 40 toward one another to slip the vertical pins 36 of the walls 14, 18 into the
             apertures 42.
       [0036]              Figure 11 is a front view of the hinge member 30. Figure 12 is a side view of the
             hinge member 30. Figure 13 is a top view of the hinge member 30.
       [0037]              In use, the container 10 may be loaded with goods for sale, such as grocery
             items, such as egg cartons.            A plurality of such containers 10 may be stacked and
             shipped to a store.            At the store, the front wall 18 is then unlatched and pivoted
             approximately 270* out of the way. The front wall rotates 180* along the vertical axis at
             the corner of the egg container 10. The double hinge design of hinges 24 then rotates
             another 900 and allows the front wall 18 to abut the first side wall 14. The front wall 18
             may be temporarily latched into a holding position along the first side wall 14 (latch not
             shown). The container 10 has asymmetric handle openings 20 on both side walls 14, 15.
             This is done to make sure the handle opening 20 on the first side wall 14 matches up
             with the centered handle opening 22 on the front wall 18 when it is in the retracted
             position (Figure 2). The handle opening 20 on the second side wall 15 is diagonally
             opposite from the handle opening 20 on the first side wall 14, which still allows the load
             to be balanced when lifting the container 10 using both side wall handle openings 20.
       [0038]              Using the handle openings 20, 22, the container 10 is placed on the shelf. The
             open front of the container 10 faces the door of the refrigerator or cooler. The front
             opening of the container 10 is maximized to match the internal width of the container
             10 (from first side wall 14 to second side wall 15) and makes it much easier for a
             customer to remove egg cartons (for example) from the container 10.                  When the
             container 10 is empty, the walls 14, 15, 16, 18 are able to fold down into a collapsed
             position (Figure 7), which allows for compact storage when the container 10 is not being

             used.         The collapsed container 10 is shipped back to the warehouse or other facility
             where it is reloaded and reused to ship more goods to the store.
       [0039]              Figure 14 is a perspective view of a hinge member 130 according to a second
             embodiment. The hinge member 130 may be injection molded as a single piece of HDPE
             or other suitable material. The hinge member 130 is symmetrical about its long axis and
             about an axis perpendicular to the long axis. The hinge member 130 includes a pair of
             bases 140 at opposite ends. Each base 140 has a pair of apertures 142 formed therein.
             Outer walls 144 extend from outer edges of each base 140 toward the outer walls 144
             of the other base 140.            Curved walls 146 curve inward from the outer walls 144,
             straighten and then curve back to meet at two spaced-part center walls 148 joined by a
             central web 150. Each of the center walls 148 join two curved walls 146 from opposing
             bases 140.
       [0040]              Shown more clearly in Figure 15, tabs 152 project outward from each base 140,
             projecting generally from one of the apertures 142 in each base 140 and in a direction
             perpendicular to the base 140.           The tabs 152 project in a direction parallel to one
             another.
       [0041]              Figure 16 shows a collapsible bin 110 incorporating a plurality of the hinge
             members 130 (not visible in Figure 16) of Figures 14-15. The bin 110 includes a pair of
             opposed first walls 114 pivotably secured to first upstanding flanges 113 extending
             upward from the base 112. The bin 110 also includes a pair of opposed second walls
             116 pivotably secured to second upstanding flanges 115 extending upward from the
             base 112. The walls 114, 116 are selectively secured to one another in the upright
             position by latches 117.
       [0042]              In Figure 17, only two walls 14, 16 are shown for illustration. A plurality of the
             hinge members 130 connect the plurality of walls 114, 116 to a base 112. A plurality of
             the hinge members 130 connect each of the walls 114, 116 to the upstanding flanges
             113, 115, respectively, on the base 112. The second upstanding flanges 115 are taller
             than the first upstanding flanges 113.

       [0043]              Figure 18 is an enlarged interior view of a portion of the bin 110 of Figure 17
             showing one of the hinge members 130 securing one of the first walls 114 to the base
             112. The first upstanding flange 113 includes a notch or recess 132 formed therein for
             receiving the lower portion of the hinge member 130. The recess 132 includes a pair of
             pins 136 projecting toward one another into opposed apertures 142 in the opposite
             bases 140. Likewise, the first wall 114 includes a notch or recess 134 for receiving the
             upper portion of the hinge member 130. The recess 134 also includes a pair of pins 136
             projecting toward one another into opposed apertures 142 in the opposite bases 140.
             To install the hinge member 130, the bases 140 at one end can be squeezed toward one
             another as shown in Figure 19 (exaggerated for illustration). The curved walls 146 flex
             and bend as the apertures 142 are moved closer to one another to fit between the
             opposed pins 136 until the pins 136 can be aligned with the apertures 142. The hinge
             member 130 then returns to its original position with the bases 140 spaced further
             apart and with the pins 136 received in the apertures 142 as shown in Figure 20 (and
             Figure 18). The other side of the hinge member 130 is squeezed and flexed to fit the
             hinge member 130 onto the other component of the bin 110 (e.g. the wall or the base,
             as the hinge member 30 of the first embodiment would be attached in the same
             manner). Figure 20 shows the hinge member 130 of Figure 18 pivotably secured to a
