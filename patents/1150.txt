SURGICAL TOOL ASSEMBLY WITH COMPACT FIRING ASSEMBLY
 BACKGROUND
 1.      Technical Description
 [0001] The present disclosure is directed to an endoscopic surgical stapling device and, more
particularly, to a surgical stapling device including a surgical tool assembly with a compact
firing assembly.
2.       Background of Related Art
 [0002] Surgical stapling devices for endoscopic use include articulating tool assemblies. Linear
endoscopic surgical stapling devices include a tool assembly having a pair ofjaws, a drive
member supporting a knife that is movable through the tool assembly, and an actuation sled
configured to eject staples from a staple cartridge supported on one of the jaws. The tool
assembly may also include a tissue stop that prevents tissue from being positioned within the
tissue gap defined by the pair of jaws at a location proximally of the location of staples of the
staple cartridge. The actuation sled is positioned distally of the drive member and the knife to
facilitate formation of the staples in tissue prior to transection of the tissue.
 [0003] Typically, the drive member includes clamping structure such as an I-beam to move the
jaws of the tool assembly from an open position to a clamped position and to define a maximum
tissue gap between the jaws of the tool assembly. In such devices, since the drive member is
positioned proximally of the actuation sled and proximally of the tissue stop, the firing assembly
of the tool assembly takes up a substantial amount of space; i.e., space on the tool assembly that
could be used more efficiently for performing a stapling or cutting operation. In articulating
surgical stapling devices, the space extending from the articulating axis or pivot point of the tool
assembly to the tissue stop should be minimized to achieve greater access to the surgical site.
This "dead space" restricts access to areas within a body cavity during an endoscopic surgical
procedure.
 [0004] It would desirable to minimize the space for the firing assembly within a tool assembly
of a endoscopic surgical stapling device and to provide greater access to tissue within a body
cavity during an endoscopic surgical procedure.

                                                   2
OBJECT
[0005] It is an object of the present invention to at least substantially satisfy the above desire.
SUMMARY
[0006] In one aspect of the disclosure, a surgical stapling device includes an elongate body and
a tool assembly supported on a distal portion of the elongate body. The tool assembly includes a
cartridge assembly and an anvil assembly which are movable in relation to each other between
spaced and approximated positions. The cartridge assembly includes a staple cartridge

[0011] In some embodiments, during the firing stroke, the engagement member is moved to a
position proximal of the cross member.
[0012] In certain embodiments, the engagement member includes a proximal ramped surface
configured to pass under the cross member of the bridge and into the channel.

                                                  3
[0013] In embodiments, the engagement member includes a distal surface configured to engage
the cross-member to translate distal movement of the clamp member to distal movement of the
actuation sled when the engagement member is positioned proximally of the cross member.
[0014] In some embodiments, the clamp member includes at least one radial extension and the
actuation sled defines a recess, wherein at least one radial extension is positioned within the
recess in the pre-actuated state.
[0015] In certain embodiments, the at least one radial extension is positioned in a proximal
portion of the recess in the pre-actuated state.
[0016] In embodiments, the cam member of the actuation sled includes first and second cam
members interconnected by a bridge. The first and second cam members define a channel
having an open proximal end and a cross-member at a distal end of the channel.
[0017] In some embodiments, the clamp member includes a vertical strut, an upper beam, and a
lower beam, and in the pre-actuated state, the vertical strut is positioned within a proximal
portion of the channel.
[0018] In certain embodiments, during a clamping stroke of the clamp member, the clamp
member moves independently of the actuation sled such that the at least one radial extension
moves from a proximal portion of the recess to a distal portion of the recess.
[0019] In embodiments, during the firing stroke, the at least one radial extension is moved from
a position within the recess to a position proximal of the actuation sled.
[0020] In some embodiments, the recess is defined by an angled proximal end wall.
[0021] In certain embodiments, the at least one radial extension has a proximal ramped surface.
[0022] In embodiments, the at least one radial extension includes two radial extensions
positioned on opposite sides of the clamp member.
[0023] In another aspect of the disclosure, a method of actuating a surgical stapling device
includes advancing a clamp member within a tool assembly independently of an actuation sled

                                                  4
to a clamped position to move the tool assembly from an open position to an approximated
position, and advancing the clamp member through a firing stroke, wherein the firing stroke
includes moving the clamp member and the actuation sled distally through a first advancement
stage, moving the clamp member proximally independently of the actuation sled through a
retraction stage, and moving the clamp member and the actuation sled distally through a second
advancement stage to eject staples from the tool assembly.
[0024] In embodiments, moving the clamp member and the actuation sled distally through the
first advancement stage includes moving the actuation sled distally past a stop member
positioned to prevent proximal movement of the actuation sled.
[0025] In some embodiments, moving the clamp member proximally independently of the
actuation sled includes moving a knife of the clamp member to a position proximally of cam
surfaces of the actuation sled.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS
[0050] The presently disclosed surgical stapling device including a tool assembly with a
compact firing assembly will now be described in detail with reference to the drawings in which
like reference numerals designate identical or corresponding elements in each of the several
views. In this description, the term "proximal" is used generally to refer to that portion of the
device that is closer to a clinician, while the term "distal" is used generally to refer to that
portion of the device that is farther from the clinician. In addition, the term "endoscopic" is
used generally to refer to endoscopic, laparoscopic, arthroscopic, and any other surgical
procedure performed through a small incision or a cannula inserted into a patient's body.
Finally, the term clinician is used generally to refer to medical personnel including doctors,
nurses, and support personnel.
[0051] The presently disclosed surgical stapling device includes a handle assembly, an elongate
body extending distally from the handle assembly, and a tool assembly which is supported on a

                                                    7
distal portion of the elongate body and has a compact firing assembly as compared to known
surgical stapling devices. In embodiments, the tool assembly is mounted onto the distal portion
of the elongate body for articulation and includes a staple cartridge that supports a plurality of
staples and pushers, an actuation sled that is movable through the staple cartridge to eject staples
from the staple cartridge, and a drive or clamp member. The clamp member is movable through
the tool assembly to move the tool assembly from an open position to an approximated position
and to advance the actuation sled through the staple cartridge to eject staples and cut tissue. In
order to minimize the space for the firing assembly in the proximal portion of the tool assembly,
the actuation sled and clamp member are supported in a nested relationship.
[0052] FIG. 1 illustrates a surgical stapling device 10 including a handle assembly 12, an
elongate body 14, and an exemplary embodiment of the presently disclosed tool assembly 100.
Although not described in detail herein, the tool assembly 100 can form part of a reload
assembly 16 that is releasable from elongate body 14 as is known in the art. Alternately, the tool
assembly 100 can be fixedly secured to a distal portion of the elongate body 14. The handle
assembly 12 includes a hand grip 18, a plurality of actuator buttons 20, and a rotation knob 22.
The rotation knob 22 facilitates rotation of the elongate body 14 and the reload 100 in relation to
the handle assembly 12 as is known in the art. The actuator buttons 20 control operation of the
various functions of the stapling device 10 including approximation, firing and cutting. The
reload can be configured for use with a robotic surgical system. Although the stapling device 10
is illustrated as an electrically powered stapling device, it is envisioned that the presently
disclosed tool assembly 100 would also be suitable for use with a manually powered surgical
stapling device. U.S. Patent No. 9,055,943 ("'943 Patent"), hereby incorporated by reference
herein in its entirety, discloses a surgical stapling device having a powered hand piece, an
adapter, and a tool assembly that is releasably coupled to the adapter.
[0053] Referring to FIGS. 2 and 3, the tool assembly 100 includes an anvil 102, and a cartridge
assembly 104. The cartridge assembly 104 includes a staple cartridge 106 that supports a
plurality of staples 108 and pushers 110, a cartridge channel 112 defining a bottom surface 1 12a,
a staple cartridge support plate 114, a drive screw 116, a clamp member 118, and an actuation
sled 120. The support plate 114 includes a resilient protrusion, e.g., a resilient lance 1 14a (FIG.
4), that defines a stop surface for the actuation sled 120 as described in further detail below.
Alternatively other protrusion configurations are envisioned. The staple cartridge 106 defines a
central knife slot 140 and is attached within the support plate 114 by a snap-fit or other

                                                  8
connection. The support plate 114 and staple cartridge 106 assembly are attached to the
cartridge channel 112 also by a snap-fit connection. Alternately, other techniques for securing
these components together may be used. The staple cartridge 106 includes a tissue contact
surface 124 that defines a plurality of rows of laterally spaced staple retention slots 124a
configured as holes in the tissue contacting surface 124. Each slot 124a receives one of the
staples 108 and a respective pusher 110. The staple cartridge 106 also defines a plurality of
longitudinal cam slots (not shown) which accommodate the staple pushers 110 and are open on
an end opposite to the tissue-contacting surface 124 to facilitate passage of the actuation sled
120.
[0054] The anvil assembly 102 is pivotally coupled to the cartridge assembly 104 about pivot
members 122 that extend through openings 125 defined in a proximal portion of the anvil
assembly 102 and openings 127 defined in a proximal portion of the cartridge assembly 106.
The anvil assembly 102 is pivotal in relation to the cartridge assembly 106 to transition the tool
assembly 100 between open (FIG. 1) and approximated (FIG. 2) positions. The anvil assembly
102 includes a tissue contact surface 102a (FIG. 9) that defines a plurality of staple deforming
depressions (not shown) as is known in the art. The anvil assembly 102 includes an abutment
surface 128 (FIG. 9) and a tissue stop 130. The abutment surface 128 is positioned to be
engaged by the clamp member 118 to facilitate movement of the tool assembly 100 from the
open position to the approximated position. In embodiments, the tissue stop 130 includes a pair
of downwardly extending wings 130a positioned on opposite sides of the tissue contact surface
102a of the anvil assembly 102. The wings 130a extend below the tissue contact surface 124 of
the staple cartridge 106 when the tool assembly 100 is in the open position and have a distal
tissue engaging surface 130b. The tissue stop 130 prevents tissue from passing into the tool
assembly 100 between the anvil and cartridge assemblies 102, 104 beyond the tissue stop 130 to
prevent tissue that cannot be stapled from being cut.
[0055] Referring also to FIGS. 5 and 6, the clamp member 118 includes a base 142, a vertical
strut 144, an upper beam 146, and a lower beam 148. The vertical strut 144 has a first end
secured to the base 142 and a second end secured to the upper beam 146. Alternately, the base,
upper beam and vertical strut can be integrally formed as a unit. In embodiments, the base 142
defines a threaded bore 150 that rotatably receives the drive screw 116 (FIG. 3). The drive screw
116 is threaded and is rotatable within the threaded bore 150 of the clamp member 118 to

                                                  9
translate the rotational movement of the drive screw 116 into longitudinal movement of the
clamp member 118.
[0056] The vertical strut 144 includes a distal surface that defines a knife 152 that is positioned
between the upper and lower beams 146, 148. The upper beam 146 is positioned to engage the
abutment surface 128 of the anvil assembly 102 such that movement of the clamp member 118
from a retracted position to a clamped position moves the tool assembly 100 from the open
position (FIG. 9) to the approximated position (FIG. 11). The upper beam 146 is also positioned
to translate through a channel 160 (FIG. 9) defined in the anvil assembly 102 and the lower
beam 148 is positioned to translate along the bottom surface 1 12a of the cartridge channel 112
to define a maximum tissue gap between the tissue contact surfaces 102a, 124 of the anvil
assembly102 and the staple cartridge 106.
[0057] The clamp member 118 also includes a nose 164 that extends distally from a surface of
the base 142 that is spaced from the lower flange 148. The nose 164 supports an engagement
member 166 that includes a proximal ramped surface 166a and a distal surface 166b that is
configured to engage and advance the actuation sled 120.
[0058] The actuation sled 120 includes a pair of spaced cam members 170a, 170b. Each cam
member 170a, 170b is positioned to translate through a respective longitudinal cam slot (not
shown) of the staple cartridge 106 and interact with the pushers 110 (FIG. 3) to eject staples 108
from the staple cartridge 106 as is known in the art. In embodiments, each of the cam
members170a, 170b includes two spaced cam surfaces 174, 176 that sequentially engage the
pushers 110 (FIG. 3) as the actuation sled 120 translates through the staple cartridge 106 to lift
the pushers 110 within the staple retention slots 124a of the staple cartridge 106 and eject the
staples 108 from the staple retention slots 124a of the staple cartridge 106. The angle of the cam
surfaces 174, 176 may vary along the length of the cam surfaces 174, 176 to better control
movement of the pushers 108 through the staple retention slots 124a and provide better staple
formation. For example, the cam surfaces 174, 176 may have a distal portion 180 and a proximal
portion 182 wherein the proximal portion 182 is steeper than the distal portion 180.
[0059] The cam members 170a, 170b are connected together by a bridge 184 that defines a
longitudinal channel 186 having an open proximal end between the cam members 170a, 170b.
The bridge 184 also includes a cross member 188 at the distal end of the channel 186. The

                                                  10
channel 186 is dimensioned to slidably receive the engagement member 166 formed on the
distal end of the nose 164 of the clamp member 118 as discussed in further detail below.
[0060] Referring to FIGS. 7-10, when the surgical stapling device 10 is in a pre-fired state, the
clamp member 118 and the actuation sled 120 are in a nested configuration. In the nested
configuration, the nose 164 of the clamp member 118 is positioned beneath the bridge 184 of the
actuation sled 120 and the vertical strut 144 is positioned within a proximal portion of the
channel 186 of the actuation sled 120 such that the engagement member 166 is positioned
distally of the cross member 188 of the actuation sled 120. In addition, the upper beam 146
(FIG. 9) of the clamp member 118 is positioned proximally of the abutment surface 128 and the
channel 160 of the anvil assembly 102. In this position, the sled 120 is positioned atop the lance
114a (FIG. 4) of the support plate 114 to urge the lance 114a out of a path of movement of the
actuation sled 120.
[0061] Referring to FIGS. 9 and 10, the drive screw 116 extends through the threaded bore 150
of the clamp member 118 and includes a proximal portion that is coupled to a drive member 190
supported within the elongate body 114. The proximal portion of the drive screw 116 is
supported on a bearing 192 that is configured to rotatably support the drive screw 116 as is
known in the art. U.S. Patent No. 8,512,359, hereby incorporated by reference herein, discloses
a surgical stapling device including a drive screw 116 and drive member 190
[0062] Referring to FIGS. 11 and 12, when the drive screw 116 is actuated via the handle
assembly 12 and the elongate body 14 to advance the clamp member 118 through a clamping
stroke of the surgical stapling device 10, the clamp member moves from a retracted position to a
clamped position. As the clamp member 118 moves towards the clamped position, the clamp
member 118 moves independently of the actuation sled 120 along the drive screw 116 distally
through the longitudinal channel 186 of the bridge 184 of the actuation sled 120. As the clamp
member 118 moves distally within the proximal portion of the tool assembly 100, the upper
beam 146 engages the abutment surface 128 of the anvil assembly 102 such that continued distal
movement of the clamp member 118 in the direction indicated by arrow "A" in FIG. 12 to the
clamped position pivots the anvil assembly 102 in the direction indicated by arrow "B" in FIG.
11 to urge the tool assembly 100 from the open position (FIG. 9) to the approximated position
(FIG. 11). It is envisioned that the anvil assembly 102 may be stationary and the cartridge

                                                   11
assembly 104 may pivot from the open position to the approximated position in relation to the
anvil assembly 102.
[0063] In the clamped position, the vertical strut 144 of the clamp member 118 is positioned
immediately proximal of the cross member 188 of the bridge 184 of the actuation sled 120 in the
distal portion of the channel 186 and the tool assembly 100 is in the approximated position with
the tissue contact surface 124 of the cartridge assembly 106 positioned in juxtaposed alignment
with the tissue contact surface 102a of the anvil assembly 102. In addition, the sled 120 remains
atop the lance 1 14a of the support plate 114.
[0064] In order to eject staples from the tool assembly 100, the drive member 116 is actuated
again via the handle assembly 12 and the elongate body 14 to move the clamp member 118
through a firing stroke. During the firing stroke, the clamp member 118 and the actuation sled
120 are moved through a first advancement stage shown in FIG. 13, through a retraction stage
shown in FIGS. 14 and 15, and through a second advancement stage shown in FIG. 16. Each of
these stages is described below.
[0065] Referring to FIG. 13, during the first advancement stage of the firing stroke, the drive
screw 116 advances the clamp member 118 in the direction indicated by arrow "A" distally from
the clamped position. Since the vertical strut 144 is positioned adjacent the cross member 188,
distal movement of the clamp member 118 causes the vertical strut 144 to engage a proximal
end of the actuation sled 120 to advance the actuation sled 120 distally through the tool
assembly 100. When the actuation sled 120 is advanced past the lance 114a, the lance 114a
flexes upwardly into the path of the actuation sled 120 the first advancement stage ends.
[0066] Referring to FIG. 14, during the retraction stage of the firing stroke, the drive screw 116
is rotated in an opposite direction to retract the clamp member 118 in the direction indicated by
arrows "B" within the tool assembly 100. The lance 114a prevents proximal movement of the
actuation sled 120 such that the clamp member 118 moves proximally independently of the
actuation sled 118. As the clamp member 118 moves proximally, the nose 164 of the clamp
member 118 slides under the bridge 184 until the proximal ramped surface 166a of the
engagement member 166 engages the cross member 188 of the bridge 184. When this occurs,
continued proximal movement of the engagement member 166 of the clamp member 118 causes
the cross member 188 to ride up the proximal ramped surface 166a of the engagement member

                                                 12
166 into a cutout 200 in the staple cartridge 106. This allows the engagement member 166 of the
clamp member 118 to move beneath the cross member 188 of the bridge 184 of the actuation
member 120. By moving the clamp member 118 further proximally of the actuation sled 120,
the tool assembly 100 is configured to staple tissue prior to cutting of tissue.
[0067] Referring to FIG. 15, after the retraction stage of the firing stroke, the distal surface 166b
of the engagement member 166 of the clamp member 118 is positioned adjacent to a proximal
side of the cross member 188 of the actuation sled 120 and the knife 152 of the clamp member
118 is positioned proximally of the proximal end of the cam surfaces 174, 176 of the actuation
sled 120. As discussed above, this ensures that tissue is stapled prior to being cut.
[0068] Referring to FIG. 16, during the second advancement stage of the firing stroke, the drive
screw 116 is rotated to advance the clamp member 118 distally in the direction indicated by
arrow "C" through the tool assembly 100. Since the distal surface 166b of the engagement
member 166 of the clamp member 118 is positioned adjacent to the proximal side of the cross
member 188, distal movement of the clamp member 118 effects distal movement of the
actuation sled 120 within the tool assembly 100. As the actuation sled 120 and the clamp
member 118 are advanced through the tool assembly 100, the cam members 170a, 170b of the
actuation sled 120 sequentially engage the pushers 110 to sequentially drive the staples 108
from the staple retention slots 124a.
[0069] FIGS. 17 and 18 illustrate an alternate embodiment of the presently disclosed clamp
member 218 and actuation sled 220. The clamp member 218 includes a base 242, a vertical strut
244, an upper beam 246, and a lower beam 248. The vertical strut 244 has a first end secured to
the base 242 and a second end secured to the upper beam 246. In embodiments, the base 142
defines a threaded bore 250 that rotatably receives a drive screw 116 (FIG. 3). As discussed
above, the drive screw 116 is threaded and is rotatable within the threaded bore 250 of the clamp
member 218 to translate the rotational movement of the drive screw 116 into longitudinal
movement of the clamp member 218.
[0070] The vertical strut 244 of the clamp member 218 includes a distal surface that defines a
knife 252 that is positioned between the upper and lower beams 246, 248. The upper beam 246
is positioned to engage an abutment surface 228 (FIG. 19) of the anvil assembly 202 such that
movement of the clamp member 218 from a retracted position to a clamped position (FIG. 19)

                                                  13
moves the tool assembly 200 from the open position to the approximated position (FIG. 19). As
discussed above in regard to the tool assembly 100, the upper beam 246 of the tool assembly
200 (FIG. 19) is also positioned to translate through a channel (not shown) defined in the anvil
assembly 202 (FIG. 19) and the lower beam 248 is positioned to translate along the bottom
surface 212a of the cartridge channel 212 to define a maximum tissue gap between tissue
contact surfaces (not shown) of the anvil assembly 202 and the staple cartridge 206.
[0071] The clamp member 218 also includes radial extensions 264 that extend outwardly from
opposite sidewalls of the base 242. The radial extensions 264 each include a proximal ramped
surface 266a and a distal surface 266b that is configured to engage and advance the actuation
sled 220 as described in further detail below.
[0072] Referring also to FIG. 19, the actuation sled 220 includes a pair of spaced cam members
270a, 270b that are substantially similar to the spaced cam members 170a, 170b described above
in regard to the actuation sled 120 and will not be described in further detail herein. The cam
members 270a, 270b define a channel 271 having an open proximal end and a distal cross
member 288. Each cam member 270a, 270b is positioned to translate through a respective
longitudinal cam slot (not shown) of the staple cartridge 206 and interact with the pushers (not
shown) to eject staples from the staple cartridge 206 as is known in the art. As shown, the
actuation sled 220 defines a recess 284 having a distal end wall 284a that is perpendicular to a
longitudinal axis of the tool assembly 200 and a proximal end wall 284b that defines an acute
angle with the longitudinal axis of the tool assembly 200. The recess 284 is dimensioned and
configured to receive the radial extensions 264 of the clamp member 218.
[0073] Referring briefly to FIG. 22, the tool assembly 200 includes a support plate 214 that is
similar to support plate 114 as described above in regard to tool assembly 100. The support plate
214 differs from support plate 114 in that the support plate 214 includes at least one inwardly
extending resilient tab 214a instead of the lance 114a (FIG. 4). Although only one tab 214a is
shown, the support plate 214a can include a tab 214a on each side of the support plate 214. The
tabs 214a function in a manner similar to the lance 114a (FIG. 4) in that they provide a stop
surface to prevent proximal movement of the actuation sled 220 within the support plate 214.
When the actuation sled 220 is in its retracted position (FIGS. 19 and 20), a side of the sled 220
is positioned to urge the resilient tabs 214a inwardly out of a path of movement of the actuation
sled 220.

                                                  14
[0074] Referring to FIG. 19, prior to actuating the tool assembly 200, the clamp member 218
(shown in phantom) and the actuation sled 220 are in a nested relationship in a proximal portion
of the tool assembly 200 with the vertical strut 244 of the clamp member 218 positioned in the
channel 271 of the actuation sled 220 and the radial extensions 264 of the clamp member 218
positioned adjacent the proximal wall 284b defining recess 284. As discussed above, in the
retracted position of the actuation sled 220, the resilient tabs 214a of the support plate 214
engage sidewalls of the support plate 214 and are urged out of the path of movement of the
actuation sled 220.
[0075] When the drive screw 116 (FIG. 3) is actuated via the handle assembly 12 (FIG. 1) and
the elongate body 14 (FIG. 1) to advance the clamp member 218 through a clamping stroke of
the surgical stapling device 10, the clamp member 218 moves distally within the tool assembly
200 from its retracted position (shown in phantom) to a clamped position. As the clamp member
218 moves towards the clamped position in the direction indicated by arrow "D", the vertical
strut 244 of the clamp member 218 are advanced within the channel 271 of the actuation sled
220 and the radial extensions 264 of the clamp member 218 are advanced through the recess 284
of the actuation sled 220 such that the clamp member 218 moves independently of the actuation
sled 220 along the drive screw 116. As the clamp member 218 moves towards the clamped
position, the upper beam 246 of the clamp member 218 engages the abutment surface 228 of the
anvil assembly 202 to pivot the anvil assembly 202 in the direction indicated by arrow "E" to
the approximated position. When the clamp member 218 is in the clamped position, the radial
extensions 264 of the clamp member 218 are positioned in the distal end of the recess 284 of the
actuation sled 220 adjacent the distal end wall 284a defining the recess 284. The actuation sled
220 remains in its fully retracted position.
[0076] In order to eject staples from the tool assembly 200, the drive member 116 (FIG. 3) is
actuated again via the handle assembly 12 and the elongate body 14 to move the clamp member
218 through a firing stroke. During the firing stroke, the clamp member 218 and the actuation
sled 220 are moved through a first advancement stage shown in FIGS. 19 and 20, through a
retraction stage shown in FIG. 21, and through a second advancement stage shown in FIG. 23.
Each of these stages is described below.
[0077] Referring to FIG. 20, during the first advancement stage of the firing stroke, the drive
screw 116 advances the clamp member 218 in the direction indicated by arrow "F" distally from

                                                  15
the clamped position. In the clamped position, the vertical strut 244 of the clamp member 218 is
positioned in a distal end of the channel 271 of the actuation sled 220 adjacent the cross member
288 and the radial extensions 264 on the clamp member 218 are positioned adjacent the distal
end wall 284a defining the recess 284 in the actuation sled 220. As such, when the clamp
member 218 is advanced along the drive screw 116 (FIG. 3), the vertical strut 244 of the clamp
member 218 engages the cross member 288 (FIG. 17) and the radial extensions 264 engage the
distal end wall 284a defining the recess 284 and push the actuation sled 220 distally within the
tool assembly 200. When the actuation sled 220 is advanced past the resilient tabs 214a (FIG.
22), the tabs 214a flex inwardly into the path of movement of the actuation sled 220 to prevent
proximal movement of the actuation sled 220. At this point, the first advancement stage ends.
[0078] Referring to FIGS. 21 and 22, during the retraction stage of the firing stroke, the drive
screw 116 is rotated in an opposite direction to retract the clamp member 218 in the direction
indicated by arrow "G" within the tool assembly 100. The tabs 214a prevent proximal
movement of the actuation sled 220 such that the clamp member 118 moves proximally
independently of the actuation sled 218. As the clamp member 218 moves proximally within the
tool assembly 200, the radial extensions 264 slide within the recess 284 of the actuation sled 220
until the proximal ramped surfaces 266a of the radial extensions 264 engage the proximal end
wall 284b defining the recess 284. When the proximal ramped surfaces 266a of the radial
extensions 264 engage the proximal end wall 284b defining the recess 284, the actuation sled
220, which is engaged with the tabs 214a (FIG. 22) and cannot move proximally, is cammed
upwardly in the direction indicated by arrow "H" in FIG. 21, to allow the radial extensions 264
to exit the recess 284 and move to a position proximally of the actuation sled 220 (FIG. 23).By
moving the clamp member 218 further proximally of the actuation sled 220, the tool assembly
200 is configured to staple tissue prior to cutting tissue.
[0079] After the retraction stage of the firing stroke, the distal surface 266b of the radial
extensions 264 of the clamp member 218 is positioned adjacent to a proximal side of the
actuation sled 220 and the knife 252 (FIG. 18) of the clamp member 218 is positioned
proximally of the proximal end of the cam members 270a, 270b of the actuation sled 220. As
discussed above, this ensures that tissue is stapled prior to being cut.
[0080] Referring to FIG. 23, during the second advancement stage of the firing stroke, the drive
screw 116 is rotated to advance the clamp member 218 distally in the direction indicated by

                                                 16
arrow "I" through the tool assembly 200. Since the distal surface 266b of the radial extensions
264 of the clamp member 218 are positioned adjacent to the proximal side of the actuation sled
220, distal movement of the clamp member 118 effects distal movement of the actuation sled
220 within the tool assembly 200. As the actuation sled 220 and the clamp member 218 are
advanced through the tool assembly 200, the cam members 270a, 270b (FIG. 18) of the
actuation sled 220 sequentially engage the pushers 110 (FIG. 3) to sequentially drive the staples
108 from the staple retention slots 124a.
