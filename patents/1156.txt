       Technical Field
[la]     The present invention relates generally to a method and apparatus for controlling
       connection between devices, and more particularly, to a method and apparatus for
       automatically controlling connection between devices without inputting identification and
       authentication information.
       Background Art
[2]      Due to the recent increase in use of the number of products related to a home network,
       individual accounts are now required to manage private data of each family member used
       in shared products inside a house, and to connect a device in an external network to a
       device in an in-house network. However, since an additional text input is used to input an
       IDentifier (ID) and a password in a general account authentication method, an input
       process has to be inconveniently performed whenever an account is authenticated.
       Disclosure of Invention
       Solution to Problem
[3]      An aspect of the present invention provides a method and apparatus for easily allowing
       a direct connection between devices via a network, without using a server, by receiving
       information related to a device to be connected, from a device that pre-stores device
       information in the network, when a connection history between the devices does not
       exist.

[16]   INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK
     Mode for the Invention
[17]   Hereinafter, the present invention will be described in detail by explaining various
     embodiments of the invention with reference to the attached drawings. Like reference
     numerals in the drawings denote like elements. In the following description of the present
     invention, a detailed description of known functions and configurations incorporated
     herein will be omitted for the sake of clarity and conciseness.
[18]   FIG. I illustrates a method of controlling connection between devices, according to an
     embodiment of the present invention.

[19]   Referring to FIG. 1, in step 110, an apparatus for controlling connection between
     devices detects an external device and attempts to access the external device via a
     network. Access may be attempted by using a connected Access Point (AP) or by wire.
     The apparatus detects an external device in a sensing proximity range. When the
     apparatus detects an external device, the apparatus and the external device are de
     termined as being in the same network, and thus are connected to each other without
     authenticating accounts, in a manner similar to Digital Living Network Alliance
     (DLNA) devices.
[20]   In step 120, the apparatus receives from the connected external device identification
     information (e.g., an ID) of the external device. The identification information includes
     at least one of a Media Access Control (MAC) address of a network module uniquely
     included in every device, a name for identifying a device in a network, and a model
     type. However, the identification information is not limited thereto as long as in
     formation for identifying the external device is used.
[21]   In step 130, the apparatus determines whether the external device is registered in a
     pre-stored device list based on the received identification information of the external
     device. The device list includes identification information of at least one external
     device to be connected, and may be formed as metadata. Examples of the identification
     information are the same as those of the identification information described above in
     step 120. The device list may further include authentication information (e.g., a
     password) for connecting two devices.
[22]   The authentication information of an external device includes at least one of a com
     bination of numbers designated by a user of the external device (e.g., 1111), a pattern
     input (e.g., an input of a line or a figure on a touch panel), and biological information
     of the user of the external device (e.g., voice or a fingerprint of the user). The
     apparatus determines whether the received identification information of the external
     device matches the identification information registered in the device list. If the
     external device is registered in the device list, the method proceeds to step 140. If the
     external device is not registered in the device list, the method proceeds to step 150.
[23]   In step 140, the apparatus receives user authentication information of the external
     device. The apparatus receives from the external device the user authentication in
     formation of the external device, e.g., a password. When the received user authen
     tication information matches pre-stored user authentication information, the method
     proceeds to step 160. Alternatively, if the user authentication information of the
     external device is pre-stored, the apparatus may call the pre-stored user authentication
     information. In this case, the method directly proceeds to step 160 without checking
     whether the user authentication information matches pre-stored user authentication in
     formation.

[24]    In step 150, the apparatus may register the external device. If the external device is
     desired to be registered, the apparatus registers the external device in the device list
     based on an input of the user authentication information. If the external device is
     registered in the device list, the method proceeds to step 140. Otherwise, the method is
     terminated.
[25]    In step 160, the apparatus and the external device are connected to each other.
[26]    FIG. 2 illustrates a method of controlling connection between devices, according to
     an embodiment of the present invention.
[27]    Referring to FIG. 2, steps 210 through 230 are similar to steps 110 through 130 il
     lustrated in FIG. 1, and thus will not be described here. The external device in FIG. I is
     described as a first device in FIG. 2. Also, if the first device is registered in a device
     list, the method proceeds to step 260. Otherwise, the method proceeds to step 240.
[28]    An apparatus for controlling connection between devices obtains information related
     to the first device from a second device that stores the information related to the first
     device, as described below in steps 240 and 250.
[29]    In step 240, if the first device is not registered in the device list, the apparatus
     transmits identification information of the first device to the second device that stores
     the information related to the first device. Unlike in FIG. 1, instead of registering the
     first device, the apparatus requests the second device that stores the information related
     to the first device, for the information related to the first device. The information
     related to the first device may be requested by transmitting the received identification
     information of the first device to the second device. Examples of the identification in
     formation of the first device are the same as those of the identification information
     described above in step 130 of FIG. 1.
[30]    In step 250, the apparatus receives authentication information of the first device from
     the second device. Examples of the authentication information of the first device are
     the same as those of the authentication information described above in step 130 of FIG.
      1. Alternatively, the second device may restrict a device from which or to which the
     authentication information is transmittable, according to a level of the device. In this
     case, the second device may not transmit and may restrict the authentication in
     formation according to the first device or the apparatus.
[31]    In step 260, the apparatus and the first device are connected to each other. If the in
     formation related to the first device is obtained from the second device, or if the first
     device is registered in the device list, the apparatus and the first device are connected
     to each other.
[32]    FIG. 3 illustrates a scenario of the method illustrated in FIG. I or 2.
[33]    Referring to FIG. 3, each of devices A 310 through D 340 includes device metadata
     DB (database) including a device list. The device metadata DB includes user account

     information including information related to devices to be connected. The user account
     information may be input by a user.
[341   The device A 310 includes identification information 312 of the device B 320, identi
     fication information 314 of the device C 330, and authentication information 316 (i.e.
     user password or "user pass") of the devices B 320 and C 330. The device B 320
     includes identification information 322 and authentication information 324 of the
     device A 310. The device C 330 includes identification information 332 and authen
     tication information 334 of the device A 310. The device D 340 includes identification
     information 342 of the device A 310, identification information 344 of the device B
     320, identification information 346 of the device C 330, and authentication information
     348 of the devices A 310 through C 330.
[35]   If the devices A 310 and B 320 are to be connected to each other, since each of the
     devices A 310 and B 320 includes information related to the other device, the devices
     A 310 and B 320 are automatically connected to each other without inputting in
     formation required for connection. When the devices A 310 and C 330 are to be
     connected to each other, since each of the devices A 310 and C 330 includes in
     formation related to the other device, the devices A 310 and C 330 are automatically
     connected to each other without inputting information required for connection.
[36]   When the devices B 320 and C 330 are to be connected to each other, since each of
     the devices B 320 and C 330 does not include information related to the other device,
     the devices B 320 and C 330 are not connected to each other without inputting in
     formation required for connection, and have to request the device D 340 that stores in
     formation related to the devices B 320 and C 330, for the information related to the
     devices B 320 and C 330. Then, the devices B 320 and C 330 respectively receive the
     identification information 346 of the device C 330 and the identification information
     344 of the device B 320, and the authentication information 348 of the devices C 330
     and B 320, and the device B 320 is automatically connected to the device C 330 or the
     device C 330 is automatically connected to the device B 320.
[37]   FIG. 4 illustrates images of an interface for registering a device.
[38]   Referring to FIG. 4, a first interface screen 410 includes an item 411 for displaying
     the name of a user-owned device (indicated as 'my own' device), an item 412 for
     displaying contents of a disconnected device, an item 413 for adding a new device to a
     list of 'my own' devices, an item 414 for setting a password to be used to connect 'my
     own' device, an item 415 for managing private contents to be shared, and an item 417
     for displaying a device registered as 'my own' device.
[39]   If a user activates the item 413, a second interface screen 420 is provided. In this
     case, devices 421 through 424 that are not registered as 'my own' devices from among
     found devices are displayed on the second interface screen 420.

[40]    After that, if the device 423, e.g., ABC-galaxy, is selected to be registered as a 'my
     own' device, an interface screen 430b for displaying a window 432 for requesting to
     input a password is provided and, after the password is input, an interface screen 430a
     for displaying a window 431 showing a registration process is provided. If the user
     checks "Keep me logged in" on the window 432, the password does not need to be
     input in the future.
[41]    If the registration process is normally performed, an interface screen 440 that is the
     same as the first interface screen 410 and on which a selected device 441 is registered
     is provided.
[42]    FIG. 5 illustrates images for registering a user-owned device in another device.
[43]    Referring to FIG. 5, if a user-owned device, e.g., ABC_galaxy, which is to be
     registered as 'my own' device, is selected on a first interface screen 510, an interface
     screen 520 for displaying a window 521 for checking whether the selected device is to
     be registered in another device, e.g., XYZ- I 1OS, is provided. In FIG. 5, the other
     device is the same as the device D 340 illustrated in FIG. 3.
[44]    If a user selects an OK button, interface screens 530a, 530b, and 540 that are the
     same as the interface screens 430a, 430b, and 440 illustrated in FIG. 4 are provided.
[45]    FIG. 6 illustrates images for checking the state of a device registered as a user-owned
     device.
[461    Referring to FIG. 6, an interface screen 610 that is the same as the first interface
     screen 410 illustrated in FIG. 4 is provided. When a user selects a device 617 that is
     currently registered as a user-owned, i.e., 'my own', device, e.g., ABC-galaxy, an
     interface screen 620 for displaying a window 621 showing the state of ABCgalaxy is
     provided. The window 621 includes an item 622 for deleting a device and an item 623
     for checking detailed information. If the user selects the item 622, the selected device
     617 is deleted from a list of 'my own' devices. If the user selects the item 623, an
     interface screen 630 for displaying detailed information is provided. The interface
     screen 630 includes an item 631 for displaying the name of a device and an item 632
     for checking "Keep me logged in" that allows connection without inputting a password
     in the future.
[47]    FIG. 7 illustrates images showing an integrated list of contents in connected devices.
[48]    Referring to FIG. 7, a first interface screen 710 displays an item 715 for displaying
     content types, contents, and devices storing the contents and registered as user-owned,
     i.e., 'my own' devices. Current connected devices 711 through 714 may be displayed
     in bold type. If an item 721 for displaying private contents is selected on a second
     interface screen 720, an interface screen 730 for displaying a window 731 for re
     questing to input a password is provided. If the password is input, contents 741 through
     744 of the connected devices are integrated.

[49]   FIG. 8 illustrates a device connection control apparatus 810 for controlling
     connection between first and second devices 820 and 830, and the first and second
     devices 820 and 830 to be connected, according to the present invention.
[50]   Referring to FIG. 8, the device connection control apparatus 810 includes a commu
     nication unit 812, a storage unit 814, and a control unit 816, the first device 820
     includes a communication unit 822, a storage unit 824, and a control unit 826, and the
     second device 830 includes a communication unit 832, a storage unit 834, and a
     control unit 836.
[51]   First Example
[52]   A first example is related to controlling a connection between the apparatus 810 and
     the first device 820.
[53]   The communication unit 812 of the apparatus 810 detects the first device 820 and
     attempts to access the first device 820 via a network by using a connected AP or by
     wire. The communication unit 812 of the apparatus 810 detects the first device 820 in a
     sensing proximity range. If the communication unit 812 of the apparatus 810 detects
     the first device 820, the apparatus 810 and the first device 820 are determined as being
     in the same network, and thus are connected to each other without authenticating
     accounts, such as in a manner similar to DLNA devices.
[54]   The communication unit 812 of the apparatus 810 then receives from the connected
     first device 820 identification information (e.g., an ID) of the first device 820. The
     identification information includes at least one of a MAC address of a network module
     uniquely included in every device, a name for identifying a device in a network, and a
     model type. However, the identification information is not limited thereto as long as
     information for identifying the first device 820 is used.
[55]   The storage unit 814 of the apparatus 810 pre-stores a device list of external devices.
     The device list includes identification information of at least one external device to be
     connected, and may be formed as metadata. Examples of the identification information
     are the same as those of the identification information described above. Also, the
     device list may further include authentication information (e.g., a password) for
     connecting two devices.
[56]   The authentication information of an external device includes at least one of a com
     bination of numbers designated by a user of the external device (e.g., 1111), a pattern
     input (e.g., an input of a line or a figure on a touch panel), and biological information
     of the user of the first device 820 (e.g., voice or a fingerprint of the user). The control
     unit 816 of the apparatus 810 determines whether the first device 820 is registered in
     the device list stored in the storage unit 814 of the apparatus 810, based on received
     identification information of the first device 820. The control unit 816 of the apparatus
     810 determines whether the received identification information of the first device 820

     matches the identification information registered in the device list. If the first device
     820 is registered in the device list, the communication unit 812 of the apparatus 810
     receives user authentication information of the first device 820. The communication
     unit 812 of the apparatus 8)10 receives from the first device 820 the user authentication
     information of the first device 820, e.g., a password.
[57]   When the received user authentication information matches pre-stored user authen
     tication information, the apparatus 810 and the first device 820 are connected to each
     other. When the user authentication information of the first device 820 is pre-stored in
     the storage unit 814 of the apparatus 810, the control unit 816 of the apparatus 810
     may call the pre-stored user authentication information. In this case, the apparatus 810
     and the first device 820 are connected to each other without checking whether the user
     authentication information matches pre-stored user authentication information.
[58]   If the first device 820 is not registered in the device list, the control unit 816 of the
     apparatus 810 may register the first device 820. If the first device 820 is desired to be
     registered, the control unit 816 of the apparatus 810 registers the first device 820 in the
     device list stored in the storage unit 814 of the apparatus 810 based on an input of the
     user authentication information.
[59]   When the apparatus 810 and the first device 820 are connected to each other, their
     functions may be switched according to which device attempts to access the other
     device.
[60]   Second Example
[61]   A second example is related to controlling a connection between the apparatus 810
     and the first device 820.
[62]   The communication unit 812 of the apparatus 810 detects the first device 820. The
     communication unit 812 of the apparatus 810 attempts to access the first device 820
     via a network. According to an embodiment of the present invention, the commu
     nication unit 812 of the apparatus 810 may attempt access by using a connected AP or
     by wire. The communication unit 812 of the apparatus 810 detects the first device 820
     in a sensing proximity range. If the communication unit 812 of the apparatus 810
     detects the first device 820, the apparatus 810 and the first device 820 are determined
     as being in the same network, and thus are connected to each other without authen
     ticating accounts similarly to, for example, DLNA devices.
[63]   The communication unit 812 of the apparatus 810 then receives from the connected
     first device 820 identification information (e.g., an ID) of the first device 820. The
     identification information includes at least one of a MAC address of a network module
     uniquely included in every device, a name for identifying a device in a network, and a
     model type. However, the identification information is not limited thereto as long as
     information for identifying the first device 820 is used.

[64]   The storage unit 814 of the apparatus 810 pre-stores a device list of external devices.
     The device list includes identification information of at least one external device to be
     connected, and may be formed as metadata. Examples of the identification information
     are the same as those of the identification information described above. Also, the
     device list may further include authentication information (e.g., a password) for
     connecting two devices. The authentication information of an external device includes
     at least one of a combination of numbers designated by a user of the external device
     (e.g., 1111), a pattern input (e.g., an input of a line or a figure on a touch panel), and
     biological information of the user of the first device 820 (e.g., voice or a fingerprint of
     the user).
[65]   The control unit 816 of the apparatus 810 determines whether the first device 820 is
     registered in the device list stored in the storage unit 814 of the apparatus 810, based
     on received identification information of the first device 820. The control unit 816 of
     the apparatus 810 determines whether the received identification information of the
     first device 820 matches the identification information registered in the device list. If
     the first device 820 is registered in the device list, the apparatus 810 and the first
     device 820 are connected to each other.
[66]   If the first device 820 is not registered in the device list stored in the storage unit 814
     of the apparatus 810, the apparatus 810 obtains information related to the first device
     820 from the second device 830 that stores the information related to the first device
     820. Specifically, the communication unit 812 of the apparatus 810 transmits identi
     fication information of the first device 820 to the communication unit 832 of the
     second device 830 including the storage unit 834 that stores the information related to
     the first device 820. Unlike the first example, instead of registering the first device
     820, the apparatus 810 requests the second device 830 that stores the information
     related to the first device 820, for the information related to the first device 820.
[67]   The communication unit 812 of the apparatus 810 may request the information
     related to the first device 820 by transmitting the received identification information of
     the first device 820 to the second device 830.
[68]   The communication unit 812 of the apparatus 810 then receives authentication in
     formation of the first device 820 from the communication unit 832 of the second
     device 830. The control unit 836 of the second device 830 may restrict a device from
     or to which the authentication information is transmittable, according to a level of the
     device. In this case, the second device 830 may not transmit and may restrict the au
     thentication information according to the first device 820 or the apparatus 810.
[69]   The control unit 816 of the apparatus 810 and the first device 820 are then connected
     to each other.
[70]   Embodiments of the present invention can also be implemented as computer-readable

     code on a computer-readable recording medium. The computer-readable recording
     medium is any data storage device that can store data, which can be thereafter read by
     a computer system. Examples of the computer-readable recording medium include
     Read-Only Memory (ROM), Random-Access Memory (RAM), CD-ROMs, magnetic
     tapes, floppy disks, and optical data storage devices. The computer-readable recording
     medium can also be distributed over network-coupled computer systems so that the
     computer-readable code is stored and executed in a distributed fashion. Also,
     functional programs, codes, and code segments for accomplishing the present
     invention may be easily construed by programmers of ordinary skill in the art.
[71]   While the present invention has been particularly shown and described with reference
     to embodiments thereof, it will be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art that
     various changes in form and details may be made therein without departing from the
     spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the following claims. The embodiments
     should be considered in a descriptive sense only and not for purposes of limitation.
     Therefore, the scope of the invention is defined not by the detailed description of the
     invention but by the following claims, and all differences within the scope will be
     construed as being included in the present invention.
