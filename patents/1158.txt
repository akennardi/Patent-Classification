                 DRAINABLE WIRELESS CHARGING DEVICE
Field of the Invention
      The present invention relates to a charging device, in particular to a wireless
charging device used in underwater circumstances.
Description of the Prior Art
     For underwater tasks, several electronic devices, e.g., searchlights, cameras,
propellers, may be needed according to different operation requirements.     Because
of the limitation of the circumstances, these devices cannot be connected to main
supply; instead, these devices are powered by batteries.       However, the battery
capacity is limited, and the battery has to be charged when the device is used for a
period of time.    Hence, in the underwater circumstances, these devices cannot be
replace battery in a wired connection manner, and the battery with function of
wireless charging is suitable for charging these devices used in underwater
circumstances.
     In the aforementioned wireless charging, the charger and the device are
respectively provided with an emitting end and a receiving end, and the charger and
the device can be spaced by a distance.     The charger emits electromagnetic waves
via the emitting end, and the device receives the electromagnetic waves and converts
the electromagnetic waves into electrical energy via the receiving end, so that the
electrical energy can be charged into the battery.       However, in the underwater
circumstances, the space between the emitting end and the receiving end is occupied
by water, thus the transmission of the electromagnetic waves is absorbed by the
water.    As a result, the efficiency for charging the battery is poor, and the
                                           1

underwater tasks cannot be achieved properly.

       DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
      Please refer to Figs. 1 and 2, illustrating a drainable wireless charging device
according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.           The drainable
wireless charging device comprises a first connection member 1 and a second
connection member 2.        One of the connection members comprises an insertion
groove 21, and the other connection member comprises an inserting portion 11.        In
addition, the first connection member 1 and the second connection member 2 can be
combined with each other by inserting the inserting portion 11 into the insertion
groove 21.     In this embodiment, the first connection member 1 and the second
connection member 2 are an assembly of buckling components.               The inserting
portion 11 is extending from the first connection member 1, the insertion groove 21
is recessed from the second connection member 2, and the second connection
member 2 further comprises a drain hole 22 formed on the insertion groove 21 and
communicating with outside.
      Moreover, the first connection member 1 comprises a power emitting unit 12
used for converting electrical energy into electromagnetic waves and emitting the
electromagnetic waves outwardly.      In this embodiment, the power emitting unit 12
is assembled on the inserting portion 11 as shown in Fig. 3.      As shown, the power
emitting unit 12 has a first battery 121, a rectifier 124, a direct-current transformer
125, and an electromagnetic wave emitter 122 which are packed by a detachable
                                            6

waterproof housing 123.          The electromagnetic wave emitter 122 can convert
electricity provided by the first battery 121 into electromagnetic waves and emit the
electromagnetic waves.         When the first battery     121 runs of out power, the
waterproof housing 123 may be detached for replacing the first battery 121;
alternatively, the first battery 121 may be charged wiredly by connecting the rectifier
 124 and the direct-current transformer 125 to the main supply.            The inserting
portion 11 comprises a first attaching surface 13 corresponding to the power emitting
unit 12.
     In another embodiment, as shown in Fig. 4, the waterproof housing 123 is
undetachable, and the first battery 121 is sealed in the waterproof housing 123 and
cannot be replaced.      In such condition, when the first battery 121 runs out of power,
the first battery 121 may be charged wiredly by connecting the rectifier 124 and the
direct-current transformer 125 to the main supply.      Furthermore, the power emitting
unit 12 comprises an electromagnetic wave receiver 126 electrically connected to the
first battery    121,   and the    electromagnetic  wave receiver      126   can receive
electromagnetic waves from outside and convert the electromagnetic waves into
electrical energy for wirelessly charging the first battery 121, so that the power
emitting unit 21 can perform operation continuously.               Moreover, the power
emitting unit 21 further comprises a waterproof connector 127, so that the power
emitting unit 21 charges the first battery 121 wiredly by connecting the waterproof
connector 127 to an outer power source in underwater circumstances.
     As shown in Figs. 1 and 2, the second connection member 2 comprises a power
receiving unit 23 as shown in Fig. 5.         As shown, the power receiving unit 23
                                             7

comprises a second battery 231 and an electromagnetic wave receiver 232 which are
packed by a waterproof housing 233.           The power receiving unit 23 is used for
receiving electromagnetic waves from outside, converting the electromagnetic waves
into electrical energy, and storing the electrical energy.      The insertion groove 21
comprises a second attaching surface 24 corresponding to the power receiving unit
23.    The inserting portion 11 of the first connection member 1 has a suitable size, so
that when the inserting portion 11 is inserted into the insertion groove 21 of the
second connection member 2, the first attaching surface 13 is closely attached
against the second attaching surface 24.
      Since the wireless charging device is used in underwater circumstances, the
space in the insertion groove 21 of the second connection member 2 is occupied by
water.    Accordingly, when the inserting portion 11 of the first connection member 1
is inserted into the insertion groove 21 of the second connection member 2 to allow
the first connection member 1 to be combined with the second connection member 2,
the inserting portion 11 replaces the space of the water and occupies the space of the
insertion groove 21, and the water originally in the insertion groove 21 is drained by
the drain hole 22.    After the inserting portion 11 is inserted into the insertion groove
21, because the first attaching surface 13 is closely attached against the second
attaching surface 24, water can be drained from the space between the first attaching
surface 13 and the second attaching surface 24.       Hence, because the space between
the power emitting unit 12 and the power receiving unit 23 is free of water, the
transmission of the electromagnetic waves can be smoothly, and the charging
efficiency of the power receiving unit 23 can be improved.
                                              8

      Moreover, the present invention may be applied to different underwater
electronic device.     As shown in Fig. 6, the second connection member 2 may be
assembled on a diving suit 3 capable of being heated by electricity.       The power
receiving unit 23 is electrically connected to the diving suit 3 to provide electricity
for the diving suit 3.   When the second battery 231 of the power receiving unit 23
runs out of power and cannot drive the diving suit 3 to generate heat, the inserting
portion 11 of the first connection member 1 is inserted into the insertion groove 21
of the second connection member 2.       Hence, the second battery 231 can be charged
based on the aforementioned manner, so that the diving suit 3 can continue to
perform function.
      As shown in Fig. 7, the second connection member 2 may be assembled on an
underwater searchlight 4 capable of being driven by electricity.           The power
receiving unit 23 is electrically connected to the underwater searchlight 4 to provide
electricity for the underwater searchlight 4.    When the second battery 231 of the
power receiving unit 23 runs out of power and cannot drive the underwater
searchlight 4, the inserting portion 11 of the first connection member 1 is inserted
into the insertion groove 21 of the second connection member 2.     Hence, the second
battery 231 can be charged based on the aforementioned manner, so that the
underwater searchlight 4 can continue to perform function.
      As shown in Fig. 8, the second connection member 2 may be assembled on an
underwater camera 5 capable of being driven by electricity.      The power receiving
unit 23 is electrically connected to the underwater camera 5 to provide electricity for
the underwater camera 5.     When the second battery 231 of the power receiving unit
                                            9

23 runs out of power and cannot drive the underwater camera 5, the inserting portion
11 of the first connection member 1 is inserted into the insertion groove 21 of the
second connection member 2.      Hence, the second battery 231 can be charged based
on the aforementioned manner, so that the underwater camera 5 can continue to
perform function.
     As shown in Fig. 9, the second connection member 2 may be assembled on an
underwater propeller 6 capable of being driven by electricity.   The power receiving
unit 23 is electrically connected to the underwater propeller 6 to provide electricity
for the underwater propeller 6.       When the second battery 231 of the power
receiving unit 23 runs out of power and cannot drive the underwater propeller 6, the
inserting portion 11 of the first connection member 1 is inserted into the insertion
groove 21 of the second connection member 2.      Hence, the second battery 231 can
be charged based on the aforementioned manner, so that the underwater propeller6
can continue to perform function.
