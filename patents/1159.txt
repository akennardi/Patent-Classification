                                     ABSTRACT
Whole clump mechanical bamboo harvester. Harvests the total crop from each
clump regardless of maturity to increase raw material harvest by 60%. The total
clump of bamboo is delivered into chipping/milling equipment to produce high
volumes of raw material suitable for value-added processing.

                INNOVATION PATENT
   MECHANICAL HARVESTING OF
          SYMPODIAL BAMBOO
The following statement is a full description of this
              Innovation Application:

      MECHANICAL HARVESTING OF SYMPODIAL BAMBOO
SUMMARY
[001] Historically, all bamboo is harvested manually. The harvesting technique
is twofold. Initially as a thinning process to remove mature culms as an
alternative raw material to forest timber for the production of cellulose fibre
and as a food source using a percentage of the new annual shoots as a food
source in many third world countries.
[002] Only mature culms are removed from the clump to allow the remaining
culms to mature and harden for timber and other uses. There is also a
requirement to leave 60% of the culms for future shoot production as a food
source.
[003] Our processing innovation technology demands the maximum amount
of suitable raw material for the processing of value-added products. We
therefore harvest the total crop from each clump regardless of maturity
thereby increasing our raw material harvest by 60%.
[004] Our innovative Patent is based on the development of a World-first
Whole Clump Mechanical Bamboo Harvester. The prototype is based on an
existing Sugarcane harvesting technology, utilising the horsepower,
hydraulics and track driven machine to develop this Innovative harvesting
technology.
[005] The total clump of bamboo will be delivered into specially designed
chipping/milling equipment producing high volumes of raw material suitable
for value-added processing.
[006] The potential for exporting this technology is a definite opportunity as
more countries are establishing commercial bamboo agribusinesses.

                      CLAIM
   MECHANICAL HARVESTING OF
          SYMPODIAL BAMBOO
The following statement is a full description of this
              Innovation Application:

      MECHANICAL HARVESTING OF SYMPODIAL BAMBOO
                                    CLAIM
SUMMARY
[001] The claim to this Innovation Patent is the mechanical harvesting of
sympodial (clumping) bamboo is "World first" technology.
[002] The manufacture of a machine capable of supplying commercial
quantities of raw material to a processing facility in a ready-to-use consistent
product format for further processing will revolutionise the bamboo
Agribusiness throughout all commercial bamboo operations.
[003] There is no mechanical harvesting technology available in any country
currently growing bamboo for commercial purposes. This Innovation Patent
will offer huge manufacturing and licensing export opportunities to overseas
customers.
