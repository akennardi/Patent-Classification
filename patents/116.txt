                                        BACKGROUND
[0003]          Mucopolysaccharidosis type II (MPS II, Hunter syndrome) is an X
chromosome-linked recessive lysosomal storage disorder that results from a deficiency in the
enzyme iduronate-2-sulfatase (12S). 12S cleaves the terminal 2-0-sulfate moieties from the
glycosaminoglycans (GAG) dermatan sulfate and heparan sulfate. Due to the missing or
defective 12S enzyme in patients with Hunter syndrome, GAG progressively accumulate in
the lysosomes of a variety of cell types, leading to cellular engorgement, organomegaly,
tissue destruction, and organ system dysfunction.
[0004]          Generally, physical manifestations for people with Hunter syndrome include
both somatic and neuronal symptoms. For example, in some cases of Hunter syndrome,
central nervous system involvement leads to developmental delays and nervous system
problems. While the non-neuronal symptoms of Hunter Syndrome are generally absent at
birth, over time the progressive accumulation of GAG in the cells of the body can have a
dramatic impact on the peripheral tissues of the body. GAG accumulation in the peripheral
tissue leads to a distinctive coarseness in the facial features of a patient and is responsible for
the prominent forehead, flattened bridge and enlarged tongue, the defining hallmarks of a
Hunter patient. Similarly, the accumulation of GAG can adversely affect the organ systems
of the body. Manifesting initially as a thickening of the wall of the heart, lungs and airways,
                                                  1

and abnormal enlargement of the liver, spleen and kidneys, these profound changes can
ultimately lead to widespread catastrophic organ failure. As a result, Hunter syndrome is
always severe, progressive, and life-limiting.
[0005]          Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) is an approved therapy for treating Hunter
syndrome (MPS II), which involves administering exogenous replacement 12S enzyme to
patients with Hunter syndrome.
                               SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
[0006]          The present invention provides, among other things, improved methods and
compositions for production of recombinant 12S protein that allows more effective enzyme
replacement therapy for Hunter syndrome. The present invention encompasses the discovery
that more potent recombinant 12S protein can be produced by mammalian cells engineered to
co-express a recombinant 12S protein and a formylglycine generating enzyme (FGE).
Unexpectedly, recombinant 12S protein produced by such engineered cells has an unusually
high level of C-formylglycine (FGly) conversion percentage (e.g., greater than 70% and up
to 100%), resulting in significantly improved enzymatic activity of recombinant 12S protein.
In addition, mammalian cells co-expressing 12S and FGE proteins according to the present
invention have been successfully adapted to grow in suspension culture at a large scale.
Therefore, the present invention allows more efficient large scale production of highly potent
recombinant 12S protein.
[00071          Thus, in one aspect, the present invention provides a cell containing a first
nucleic acid encoding an iduronate-2-sulfatase (12S) protein having an amino acid sequence
at least about 5 0% (e.g., at least about  5 5 %, 60%,  65%, 7 0%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%,
96%, 97%, 98%, or 99%) identical to SEQ ID NO: 1; and a second nucleic acid encoding a
formylglycine generating enzyme (FGE) protein comprising an amino acid sequence at least
about 5 0% (e.g., at least about  5 5 %, 60%,   65%,  7 0%, 7 5 %, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%,
97%, 98%, or 99%) identical to SEQ ID NO:5, wherein the first and/or the second nucleic
acid are exogenous and wherein the cell, once cultivated under a cell culture condition (e.g.,
suspension or adherent culture), produces the 12S protein comprising at least about 70% (e.g.,
at least about 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, or 100%) conversion of the
cysteine residue corresponding to Cys59 of SEQ ID NO: 1 to Ca-formylglycine (FGly).

                                          DEFINITIONS
[0030]           In order for the present invention to be more readily understood, certain terms
are first defined. Additional definitions for the following terms and other terms are set forth
throughout the specification.
[0031]           Amino acid: As used herein, term "amino acid," in its broadest sense, refers to
any compound and/or substance that can be incorporated into a polypeptide chain. In some
embodiments, an amino acid has the general structure H2N-C(H)(R)-COOH. In some
embodiments, an amino acid is a naturally occurring amino acid. In some embodiments, an
amino acid is a synthetic amino acid; in some embodiments, an amino acid is a D-amino acid;
in some embodiments, an amino acid is an L-amino acid. "Standard amino acid" refers to
any of the twenty standard L-amino acids commonly found in naturally occurring peptides.
"Nonstandard amino acid" refers to any amino acid, other than the standard amino acids,
                                                  6

regardless of whether it is prepared synthetically or obtained from a natural source. As used
herein, "synthetic amino acid" encompasses chemically modified amino acids, including but
not limited to salts, amino acid derivatives (such as amides), and/or substitutions. Amino
acids, including carboxy- and/or amino-terminal amino acids in peptides, can be modified by
methylation, amidation, acetylation, protecting groups, and/or substitution with other
chemical groups that can change the peptide's circulating half-life without adversely
affecting their activity. Amino acids may participate in a disulfide bond. Amino acids may
comprise one or posttranslational modifications, such as association with one or more
chemical entities (e.g., methyl groups, acetate groups, acetyl groups, phosphate groups,
formyl moieties, isoprenoid groups, sulfate groups, polyethylene glycol moieties, lipid
moieties, carbohydrate moieties, biotin moieties, etc. In some embodiments, amino acids of
the present invention may be provided in or used to supplement medium for cell cultures. In
some embodiments, amino acids provided in or used to supplement cell culture medium may
be provided as salts or in hydrate form.
[0032]          Approximately: As used herein, the term "approximately" or "about," as
applied to one or more values of interest, refers to a value that is similar to a stated reference
value. In certain embodiments, the term "approximately" or "about" refers to a range of
values that fall within 25%, 20%, 19%, 18%, 17%, 16%, 15%, 14%, 13%, 12%, 110%, 10%,
9%, 8%, 7%, 6%, 5%, 4%, 3%, 2%, 1%, or less in either direction (greater than or less than)
of the stated reference value unless otherwise stated or otherwise evident from the context
(except where such number would exceed 100% of a possible value).
[0033]          Batch culture: The term "batch culture" as used herein refers to a method of
culturing cells in which all the components that will ultimately be used in culturing the cells,
including the medium (see definition of "medium" below) as well as the cells themselves, are
provided at the beginning of the culturing process. A batch culture is typically stopped at
some point and the cells and/or components in the medium are harvested and optionally
purified.
[0034]          Bioavailability: As used herein, the term "bioavailability" generally refers to
the percentage of the administered dose that reaches the blood stream of a subject.
[0035]          Biologically active: As used herein, the phrase "biologically active" refers to
a characteristic of any substance that has activity in a biological system (e.g., cell culture,
                                                 7

organism, etc.). For instance, a substance that, when administered to an organism, has a
biological effect on that organism, is considered to be biologically active. Biological activity
can also be determined by in vitro assays (for example, in vitro enzymatic assays such as
sulfate release assays). In particular embodiments, where a protein or polypeptide is
biologically active, a portion of that protein or polypeptide that shares at least one biological
activity of the protein or polypeptide is typically referred to as a "biologically active" portion.
In some embodiments, a protein is produced and/or purified from a cell culture system, which
displays biologically activity when administered to a subject. In some embodiments, a
protein requires further processing in order to become biologically active. In some
embodiments, a protein requires posttranslational modification such as, but is not limited to,
glycosylation (e.g., sialyation), farnysylation, cleavage, folding, formylglycine conversion
and combinations thereof, in order to become biologically active. In some embodiments, a
protein produced as a proform (i.e. immature form), may require additional modification to
become biologically active.
[0036]           Bioreactor:The term "bioreactor" as used herein refers to a vessel used for the
growth of a host cell culture. A bioreactor can be of any size so long as it is useful for the
culturing of mammalian cells. Typically, a bioreactor will be at least 1 liter and may be 10,
100, 250, 500, 1000, 2500, 5000, 8000, 10,000, 12,0000 liters or more, or any volume in
between. Internal conditions of a bioreactor, including, but not limited to pH, osmolarity,
C02   saturation, 02 saturation, temperature and combinations thereof, are typically controlled
during the culturing period. A bioreactor can be composed of any material that suitable for
holding cells in media under the culture conditions of the present invention, including glass,
plastic or metal. In some embodiments, a bioreactor may be used for performing animal cell
culture. In some embodiments, a bioreactor may be used for performing mammalian cell
culture. In some embodiments, a bioreactor may used with cells and/or cell lines derived
from such organisms as, but not limited to, mammalian cell, insect cells, bacterial cells, yeast
cells and human cells. In some embodiments, a bioreactor is used for large-scale cell culture
production and is typically at least 100 liters and may be 200, 500, 1000, 2500, 5000, 8000,
10,000, 12,0000 liters or more, or any volume in between. One of ordinary skill in the art
will be aware of and will be able to choose suitable bioreactors for use in practicing the
present invention.

[00371           Cell culture: These terms as used herein refer to a cell population that is gown
in a medium under conditions suitable to survival and/or growth of the cell population. As
will be clear to those of ordinary skill in the art, these terms as used herein may refer to the
combination comprising the cell population and the medium in which the population is
grown.
[00381           Cultivation: As used herein, the term "cultivation" or grammatical equvilents
refers to a process of maintaining cells under conditions favoring growth or survival. The
terms "cultivation" and "cell culture" or any synonyms are used inter-changeably in this
application.
[00391          Culture vessel: As used herein, the term "culture vessel" refers to any

[0040]          Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT): As used herein, the term "enzyme
replacement therapy (ERT)" refers to any therapeutic strategy that corrects an enzyme
deficiency by providing the missing enzyme. In some embodiments, the missing enzyme is
provided by intrathecal administration. In some embodiments, the missing enzyme is
provided by infusing into bloodstream. Once administered, enzyme is taken up by cells and
transported to the lysosome, where the enzyme acts to eliminate material that has
accumulated in the lysosomes due to the enzyme deficiency. Typically, for lysosomal
enzyme replacement therapy to be effective, the therapeutic enzyme is delivered to lysosomes
in the appropriate cells in target tissues where the storage defect is manifest.
[0041]          Expression: As used herein, "expression" of a nucleic acid sequence refers to
one or more of the following events: (1) production of an RNA template from a DNA
sequence (e.g., by transcription); (2) processing of an RNA transcript (e.g., by splicing,
editing, 5' cap formation, and/or 3' end formation); (3) translation of an RNA into a
polypeptide or protein; and/or (4) post-translational modification of a polypeptide or protein.
[0042]          Fed-batch culture: The term "fed-batch culture" as used herein refers to a
method of culturing cells in which additional components are provided to the culture at some
time subsequent to the beginning of the culture process. The provided components typically
comprise nutritional supplements for the cells which have been depleted during the culturing
                                                  9

process. A fed-batch culture is typically stopped at some point and the cells and/or
components in the medium are harvested and optionally purified.
[0043]            Fragment: The term "fragment" as used herein refers to polypeptides and is
defined as any discrete portion of a given polypeptide that is unique to or characteristic of
that polypeptide. The term as used herein also refers to any discrete portion of a given
polypeptide that retains at least a fraction of the activity of the full-length polypeptide.
Preferably the fraction of activity retained is at least 10% of the activity of the full-length
polypeptide. More preferably the fraction of activity retained is at least 20%, 30%, 40%,
50%, 60%, 70%, 80% or 90% of the activity of the full-length polypeptide. More preferably
still the fraction of activity retained is at least 95%, 96%, 97%, 98% or 99% of the activity of
the full-length polypeptide. Most preferably, the fraction of activity retained is 100% of the
activity of the full-length polypeptide. The term as used herein also refers to any portion of a
given polypeptide that includes at least an established sequence element found in the full
length polypeptide. Preferably, the sequence element spans at least 4-5, more preferably at

DNA or RNA, at least some portion of which encodes a discrete final product, typically, but
not limited to, a polypeptide, which functions in some aspect of a cellular process. The term
is not meant to refer only to the coding sequence that encodes the polypeptide or other
discrete final product, but may also encompass regions preceding and following the coding
sequence that modulate the basal level of expression, as well as intervening sequences
("introns") between individual coding segments ("exons"). In some embodiments, a gene
may include regulatory sequences (e.g., promoters, enhancers, poly adenylation sequences,
termination sequences, kozac sequences, tata box, etc.) and/or modification sequences. In
some embodiments, a gene may include references to nucleic acids that do not encode
proteins but rather encode functional RNA molecules such as tRNAs, RNAi-inducing agents,
etc.
[0045]            Gene product or expression product: As used herein, the term "gene product"
or "expression product" generally refers to an RNA transcribed from the gene (pre-and/or
post-processing) or a polypeptide (pre- and/or post-modification) encoded by an RNA
transcribed from the gene.
                                                    10

refers to any sequence element that modulates the expression of a gene to which it is operably
linked. Genetic control elements may function by either increasing or decreasing the
expression levels and may be located before, within or after the coding sequence. Genetic
control elements may act at any stage of gene expression by regulating, for example,
initiation, elongation or termination of transcription, mRNA splicing, mRNA editing, mRNA
stability, mRNA localization within the cell, initiation, elongation or termination of
translation, or any other stage of gene expression. Genetic control elements may function
individually or in combination with one another.
[00471             Homology: As used herein, the term "homology" refers to the overall
relatedness between polymeric molecules, e.g., between nucleic acid molecules (e.g., DNA
molecules and/or RNA molecules) and/or between polypeptide molecules. In some
embodiments, polymeric molecules are considered to be "homologous" to one another if their
sequences are at least 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%,
85%, 9 0%, 95%, or 99% identical. In some embodiments, polymeric molecules are
considered to be "homologous" to one another if their sequences are at least 2 5%, 3 0%, 3 5%,
4 0%  , 4 5%, 50%, 55%,     6 0%, 6 5%, 7 0%, 7 5 %, 8 0%, 8 5%, 9 0%,  95%, or 99% similar.
[0048]             Identity: As used herein, the term "identity" refers to the overall relatedness
between polymeric molecules, e.g., between nucleic acid molecules (e.g., DNA molecules
and/or RNA molecules) and/or between polypeptide molecules. Calculation of the percent
identity of two nucleic acid sequences, for example, can be performed by aligning the two
sequences for optimal comparison purposes (e.g., gaps can be introduced in one or both of a
first and a second nucleic acid sequences for optimal alignment and non-identical sequences
can be disregarded for comparison purposes). In certain embodiments, the length of a
sequence aligned for comparison purposes is at least 30%, at least 40%, at least 50%, at least
6 0%  , at least 7 0%, at least 8 0%, at least 9 0%, at least 95%, or substantially 100% of the
length of the reference sequence. The nucleotides at corresponding nucleotide positions are
then compared. When a position in the first sequence is occupied by the same nucleotide as
the corresponding position in the second sequence, then the molecules are identical at that
position. The percent identity between the two sequences is a function of the number of
identical positions shared by the sequences, taking into account the number of gaps, and the
length of each gap, which needs to be introduced for optimal alignment of the two sequences.
                                                     11

The comparison of sequences and determination of percent identity between two sequences
can be accomplished using a mathematical algorithm. For example, the percent identity
between two nucleotide sequences can be determined using the algorithm of Meyers and
Miller (CABIOS, 1989, 4: 11-17), which has been incorporated into the ALIGN program
(version 2.0) using a PAM 120 weight residue table, a gap length penalty of 12 and a gap
penalty of 4. The percent identity between two nucleotide sequences can, alternatively, be
determined using the GAP program in the GCG software package using an
NWSgapdna.CMP matrix. Various other sequence alignment programs are available and can
be used to determine sequence identity such as, for example, Clustal.
[0049]          Improve, increase, or reduce: As used herein, the terms "improve,"
"increase" or "reduce," or grammatical equivalents, indicate values that are relative to a
baseline measurement, such as a measurement in the same individual prior to initiation of the
treatment described herein, or a measurement in a control individual (or multiple control
individuals) in the absence of the treatment described herein. A "control individual" is an
individual afflicted with the same form of lysosomal storage disease as the individual being
treated, who is about the same age as the individual being treated (to ensure that the stages of
the disease in the treated individual and the control individual(s) are comparable).
[0050]          Intrathecaladministration: As used herein, the term "intrathecal
administration" or "intrathecal injection" refers to an injection into the spinal canal
(intrathecal space surrounding the spinal cord). Various techniques may be used including,
without limitation, lateral cerebroventricular injection through a burrhole or cisternal or
lumbar puncture or the like. In some embodiments, "intrathecal administration" or
"intrathecal delivery" according to the present invention refers to IT administration or
delivery via the lumbar area or region, i.e., lumbar IT administration or delivery. As used
herein, the term "lumbar region" or "lumbar area" refers to the area between the third and
fourth lumbar (lower back) vertebrae and, more inclusively, the L2-S 1 region of the spine.
[0051]          Isolated: As used herein, the term "isolated" refers to a substance and/or
entity that has been (1) separated from at least some of the components with which it was
associated when initially produced (whether in nature and/or in an experimental setting),
and/or (2) produced, prepared, and/or manufactured by the hand of man. Isolated substances
and/or entities may be separated from about 10%, about 20%, about 30%, about 40%, about
50%, about 60%, about 70%, about 80%, about 90%, about 91%, about 92%, about 93%,
                                                12

about 94%, about 95%, about 96%, about 97%, about 98%, about 99%, or more than about
99% of the other components with which they were initially associated. In some
embodiments, isolated agents are about 80%, about 85%, about 90%, about 91%, about 92%,
about 93%, about 94%, about 95%, about 96%, about 97%, about 98%, about 99%, or more
than about 99% pure. As used herein, a substance is "pure" if it is substantially free of other
components. As used herein, calculation of percent purity of isolated substances and/or
entities should not include excipients (e.g., buffer, solvent, water, etc.)
[0052]          Medium: The terms as used herein refer to a solution containing nutrients
which nourish growing cells. Typically, these solutions provide essential and non-essential
amino acids, vitamins, energy sources, lipids, and trace elements required by the cell for
minimal growth and/or survival. The solution may also contain components that enhance
growth and/or survival above the minimal rate, including hormones and growth factors. In
some embodiments, medium is formulated to a pH and salt concentration optimal for cell
survival and proliferation. In some embodiments, medium may be a "chemically defined
medium" - a serum-free media that contains no proteins, hydrolysates or components of
unknown composition. In some embodiment, chemically defined medium is free of animal
derived components and all components within the medium have a known chemical structure.
In some embodiments, medium may be a "serum based medium" - a medium that has been
supplemented animal derived components such as, but not limited to, fetal calf serum, horse
serum, goat serum, donkey serum and/or combinations thereof.
[00531          Nucleic acid: As used herein, the term "nucleic acid," in its broadest sense,
refers to a compound and/or substance that is or can be incorporated into an oligonucleotide
chain. In some embodiments, a nucleic acid is a compound and/or substance that is or can be
incorporated into an oligonucleotide chain via a phosphodiester linkage. In some
embodiments, "nucleic acid" refers to individual nucleic acid residues (e.g., nucleotides
and/or nucleosides). In some embodiments, "nucleic acid" refers to an oligonucleotide chain
comprising individual nucleic acid residues. As used herein, the terms "oligonucleotide" and
"polynucleotide" can be used interchangeably. In some embodiments, "nucleic acid"
encompasses RNA as well as single and/or double-stranded DNA and/or cDNA.
Furthermore, the terms "nucleic acid," "DNA," "RNA," and/or similar terms include nucleic
acid analogs, i.e., analogs having other than a phosphodiester backbone. For example, the so
called "peptide nucleic acids," which are known in the art and have peptide bonds instead of
                                                13

phosphodiester bonds in the backbone, are considered within the scope of the present
invention. The term "nucleotide sequence encoding an amino acid sequence" includes all
nucleotide sequences that are degenerate versions of each other and/or encode the same
amino acid sequence. Nucleotide sequences that encode proteins and/or RNA may include
introns. Nucleic acids can be purified from natural sources, produced using recombinant
expression systems and optionally purified, chemically synthesized, etc. Where appropriate,
e.g., in the case of chemically synthesized molecules, nucleic acids can comprise nucleoside
analogs such as analogs having chemically modified bases or sugars, backbone
modifications, etc. A nucleic acid sequence is presented in the 5' to 3' direction unless
otherwise indicated. The term "nucleic acid segment" is used herein to refer to a nucleic acid
sequence that is a portion of a longer nucleic acid sequence. In many embodiments, a nucleic
acid segment comprises at least 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, or more residues. In some
embodiments, a nucleic acid is or comprises natural nucleosides (e.g., adenosine, thymidine,
guanosine, cytidine, uridine, deoxyadenosine, deoxythymidine, deoxyguanosine, and
deoxycytidine); nucleoside analogs (e.g., 2-aminoadenosine, 2-thiothymidine, inosine,
pyrrolo-pyrimidine, 3-methyl adenosine, 5-methylcytidine, C-5 propynyl-cytidine, C-5
propynyl-uridine, 2-aminoadenosine, C5-bromouridine, C5-fluorouridine, C5-iodouridine,
C5-propynyl-uridine, C5-propynyl-cytidine, C5-methylcytidine, 2-aminoadenosine, 7
deazaadenosine, 7-deazaguanosine, 8-oxoadenosine, 8-oxoguanosine, 0(6)-methylguanine,
and 2-thiocytidine); chemically modified bases; biologically modified bases (e.g., methylated
bases); intercalated bases; modified sugars (e.g., 2'-fluororibose, ribose, 2'-deoxyribose,
arabinose, and hexose); and/or modified phosphate groups (e.g., phosphorothioates and 5'-N
phosphoramidite linkages). In some embodiments, the present invention is specifically
directed to "unmodified nucleic acids," meaning nucleic acids (e.g., polynucleotides and
residues, including nucleotides and/or nucleosides) that have not been chemically modified in
order to facilitate or achieve delivery.
[0054]           Perfusionprocess: The term "perfusion process" as used herein refers to a
method of culturing cells in which additional components are provided continuously or semi
continuously to the culture subsequent to the beginning of the culture process. The provided
components typically comprise nutritional supplements for the cells which have been
depleted during the culturing process. A portion of the cells and/or components in the
medium are typically harvested on a continuous or semi-continuous basis and are optionally
purified. Typically, a cell culture process involving a perfusion process is referred to as
                                                14

"perfusion culture." Typically, nutritional supplements are provided in a fresh medium
during a perfusion process. In some embodiments, a fresh medium may be identical or
similar to the base medium used in the cell culture process. In some embodiments, a fresh
medium may be different than the base medium but containing desired nutritional
supplements. In some embodiments, a fresh medium is a chemically-defined medium.
[0055]           Protein: As used herein, the term "protein" refers to a polypeptide (i.e., a
string of at least two amino acids linked to one another by peptide bonds). Proteins may
include moieties other than amino acids (e.g., may be glycoproteins, proteoglycans, etc.)
and/or may be otherwise processed or modified. Those of ordinary skill in the art will
appreciate that a "protein" can be a complete polypeptide chain as produced by a cell (with or
without a signal sequence), or can be a characteristic portion thereof. In some embodiments,
a protein can sometimes include more than one polypeptide chain, for example linked by one
or more disulfide bonds or associated by other means. In some embodiments, polypeptides
may contain L-amino acids, D-amino acids, or both and may contain any of a variety of
amino acid modifications or analogs known in the art. Useful modifications include, e.g.,
terminal acetylation, amidation, methylation, etc. In some embodiments, proteins may
comprise natural amino acids, non-natural amino acids, synthetic amino acids, and
combinations thereof. The term "peptide" is generally used to refer to a polypeptide having a
length of less than about 100 amino acids, less than about 50 amino acids, less than 20 amino
acids, or less than 10 amino acids. In some embodiments, proteins are antibodies, antibody
fragments, biologically active portions thereof, and/or characteristic portions thereof.
[0056            Recombinantprotein and Recombinantpolypeptide: These terms as used
herein refer to a polypeptide expressed from a host cell, that has been genetically engineered
to express that polypeptide. In some embodiments, a recombinant protein may be expressed
in a host cell derived from an animal. In some embodiments, a recombinant protein may be
expressed in a host cell derived from an insect. In some embodiments, a recombinant protein
may be expressed in a host cell derived from a yeast. In some embodiments, a recombinant
protein may be expressed in a host cell derived from a prokaryote. In some embodiments, a
recombinant protein may be expressed in a host cell derived from an mammal. In some
embodiments, a recombinant protein may be expressed in a host cell derived from a human.
In some embodiments, the recombinantly expressed polypeptide may be identical or similar
to a polypeptide that is normally expressed in the host cell. In some embodiments, the
                                                15

recombinantly expressed polypeptide may be foreign to the host cell, i.e. heterologous to
peptides normally expressed in the host cell. Alternatively, in some embodiments the
recombinantly expressed polypeptide can be a chimeric, in that portions of the polypeptide
contain amino acid sequences that are identical or similar to polypeptides normally expressed
in the host cell, while other portions are foreign to the host cell.
[00571           Replacement enzyme: As used herein, the term "replacement enzyme" refers
to any enzyme that can act to replace at least in part the deficient or missing enzyme in a
disease to be treated. In some embodiments, the term "replacement enzyme" refers to any
enzyme that can act to replace at least in part the deficient or missing lysosomal enzyme in a
lysosomal storage disease to be treated. In some embodiments, a replacement enzyme is
capable of reducing accumulated materials in mammalian lysosomes or that can rescue or
ameliorate one or more lysosomal storage disease symptoms. Replacement enzymes suitable
for the invention include both wild-type or modified lysosomal enzymes and can be produced
using recombinant and synthetic methods or purified from nature sources. A replacement
enzyme can be a recombinant, synthetic, gene-activated or natural enzyme.
[0058]           Vector: As used herein, "vector" refers to a nucleic acid molecule capable of
transporting another nucleic acid to which it is associated. In some embodiment, vectors are
capable of extra-chromosomal replication and/or expression of nucleic acids to which they
are linked in a host cell such as a eukaryotic and/or prokaryotic cell. Vectors capable of
directing the expression of operatively linked genes are referred to herein as "expression
vectors."
                    DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
[0059]           The present invention provides, among other things, methods and
compositions for production of recombinant 12S protein with improved potency and activity
using cells co-expressing 12S and FGE protein. In some embodiments, cells according to the
present invention are engineered to simultaneously over-express recombinant 12S and FGE
proteins. Cells according to the invention are adaptable to various cell culture conditions. In
some embodiments, cells of the present invention are adaptable to a large-scale suspension
serum-free culture.

[00601          Various aspects of the invention are described in further detail in the following
subsections. The use of subsections is not meant to limit the invention. Each subsection may
apply to any aspect of the invention. In this application, the use of "or" means "and/or"
unless stated otherwise.
Iduronate-2-sulfatase (I2S)
[00611          As used herein, an 12S protein is any protein or a portion of a protein that can
substitute for at least partial activity of naturally-occurring Iduronate-2-sulfatase (12S) protein
or rescue one or more phenotypes or symptoms associated with 12S-deficiency. As used
herein, the terms "an 12S enzyme" and "an 12S protein", and grammatical equivalents, are
used inter-changeably.
[0062]          Typically, the human 12S protein is produced as a precursor form. The
precursor form of human 12S contains a signal peptide (amino acid residues 1-25 of the full
length precursor), a pro-peptide (amino acid residues 26-33 of the full length precursor), and
a chain (residues 34-550 of the full length precursor) that may be further processed into the
42 kDa chain (residues 34-455 of the full length precursor) and the 14 kDa chain (residues
446-550 of the full length precursor). Typically, the precursor form is also referred to as full
length precursor or full-length 12S protein, which contains 550 amino acids. The amino acid
sequences of the mature form (SEQ ID NO: 1) having the signal peptide removed and full
length precursor (SEQ ID NO:2) of a typical wild-type or naturally-occurring human 12S
protein are shown in Table 1. The signal peptide is underlined. In addition, the amino acid
sequences of human 12S protein isoform a and b precursor are also provided in Table 1, SEQ
ID NO:3 and 4, respectively.

[00631           Thus, in some embodiments, an 12S enzyme is mature human 12S protein
(SEQ ID NO: 1). As disclosed herein, SEQ ID NO: 1 represents the canonical amino acid
sequence for the human 12S protein. In some embodiments, the 12S protein may be a splice
isoform and/or variant of SEQ ID NO: 1, resulting from transcription at an alternative start
site within the 5' UTR of the 12S gene. In some embodiments, a suitable replacement enzyme
may be a homologue or an analogue of mature human 12S protein. For example, a
homologue or an analogue of mature human 12S protein may be a modified mature human
12S protein containing one or more amino acid substitutions, deletions, and/or insertions as
compared to a wild-type or naturally-occurring 12S protein (e.g., SEQ ID NO: 1), while
retaining substantial 12S protein activity. Thus, in some embodiments, a replacement enzyme
suitable for the present invention is substantially homologous to mature human 12S protein
(SEQ ID NO: 1). In some embodiments, a replacement enzyme suitable for the present
invention has an amino acid sequence at least 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%,

substantially identical to mature human 12S protein (SEQ ID NO: 1). In some embodiments, a
replacement enzyme suitable for the present invention has an amino acid sequence at least

embodiments, an 12S enzyme may be a homologue or an analogue of full-length human 12S
protein. For example, a homologue or an analogue of full-length human 12S protein may be a
modified full-length human 12S protein containing one or more amino acid substitutions,
deletions, and/or insertions as compared to a wild-type or naturally-occurring full-length 12S
protein (e.g., SEQ ID NO:2), while retaining substantial 12S protein activity. Thus, In some
embodiments, an 12S enzyme is substantially homologous to full-length human 12S protein
(SEQ ID NO:2). In some embodiments, an 12S enzyme suitable for the present invention has

portion of full-length human 12S protein. As used herein, a full-length 12S protein typically
contains signal peptide sequence.
[0065]            In some embodiments, an 12S enzyme suitable for the present invention is
human 12S isoform a protein. In some embodiments, a suitable 12S enzyme may be a
homologue or an analogue of human 12S isoform a protein. For example, a homologue or an
analogue of human 12S isoform a protein may be a modified human 12S isoform a protein
containing one or more amino acid substitutions, deletions, and/or insertions as compared to a
wild-type or naturally-occurring human 12S isoform a protein (e.g., SEQ ID NO:3), while

substantially homologous to human 12S isoform a protein (SEQ ID NO:3). In some

In some embodiments, an 12S enzyme suitable for the present invention contains a fragment
or a portion of human 12S isoform a protein. As used herein, a human 12S isoform a protein
typically contains a signal peptide sequence.
[0066]            In some embodiments, an 12S enzyme is human 12S isoform b protein. In
some embodiments, an 12S enzyme may be a homologue or an analogue of human 12S
isoform b protein. For example, a homologue or an analogue of human 12S isoform b protein
may be a modified human 12S isoform b protein containing one or more amino acid
substitutions, deletions, and/or insertions as compared to a wild-type or naturally-occurring
human 12S isoform b protein (e.g., SEQ ID NO:4), while retaining substantial 12S protein
activity. Thus, In some embodiments, an 12S enzyme is substantially homologous to human
12S isoform b protein (SEQ ID NO:4). In some embodiments, an 12S enzyme has an amino
                                     6 0%, 6
acid sequence at least 50%, 55%,             5%, 7 0%, 7 5%, 8 0%, 8 5%, 9 0%, 9    1%,   9 2 %, 93%,
94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or more homologous to SEQ ID NO:4. In some
embodiments, an 12S enzyme is substantially identical to SEQ ID NO:4. In some
embodiments, an 12S enzyme has an amino acid sequence at least 50%, 55%,               6 0%, 6 5%,

identical to SEQ ID NO:4. In some embodiments, an 12S enzyme suitable for the present
invention contains a fragment or a portion of human 12S isoform b protein. As used herein, a
human 12S isoform b protein typically contains a signal peptide sequence.
[00671            Homologues or analogues of human 12S proteins can be prepared according to
methods for altering polypeptide sequence known to one of ordinary skill in the art such as
are found in references that compile such methods. In some embodiments, conservative
substitutions of amino acids include substitutions made among amino acids within the
following groups: (a) M, I, L, V; (b) F, Y, W; (c) K, R, H; (d) A, G; (e) S, T; (f) Q, N; and (g)
E, D. In some embodiments, a "conservative amino acid substitution" refers to an amino acid
substitution that does not alter the relative charge or size characteristics of the protein in
which the amino acid substitution is made.
[0068]            In some embodiments, 12S enzymes contain a moiety that binds to a receptor
on the surface of cells to facilitate cellular uptake and/or lysosomal targeting. For example,
such a receptor may be the cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor (CI-MPR)
                                                  20

which binds the mannose-6-phosphate (M6P) residues. In addition, the CI-MPR also binds
other proteins including IGF-II. A suitable lysosomal targeting moiety can be IGF-I, IGF-II,
RAP, p97, and variants, homologues or fragments thereof (e.g., including those peptide
having a sequence at least 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, or 95% identical to a wild-type
mature human IGF-I, IGF-II, RAP, p97 peptide sequence). In some embodiments, a suitable
receptor that the M6P residues bind may be cation-dependent.
Formylglycine Generating Enzyme (FGE)
[0069]           Typically, the enzyme activity of 12S is influenced by a post-translational
modification of a conserved cysteine (e.g., corresponding to amino acid 59 of the mature
human 12S (SEQ ID NO: 1)) to formylglycine, which is also referred to as 2-amino-3
oxopropionic acid, or oxo-alanine. This post-translational modification generally occurs in
the endoplasmic reticulum during protein synthesis and is catalyzed by Formylglycine
Generating Enzyme (FGE). The specific enzyme activity of 12S is typically positively
correlated with the extent to which the 12S has the formylglycine modification. For example,
an 12S protein preparation that has a relatively high amount of formylglycine modification
typically has a relatively high specific enzyme activity; whereas an 12S protein preparation
that has a relatively low amount of formylglycine modification typically has a relatively low
specific enzyme activity.
[00701           Thus, cells suitable for producing recombinant 12S protein according to the
present invention typically also express FGE protein. In some embodiments, suitable cells
express an endogenous FGE protein. In some embodiments, suitable cells are engineered to
express an exogenous (also referred to as recombinant) Formylglycine Generating Enzyme
(FGE) in combination with recombinant 12S. In some embodiments, suitable cells are
engineered to activate an endogenous FGE gene such that the expression level or activity of
the FGE protein is increased.
[00711           Typically, the human FGE protein is produced as a precursor form. The
precursor form of human FGE contains a signal peptide (amino acid residues 1-33 of the full
length precursor) and a chain (residues 34-374 of the full length precursor). Typically, the
precursor form is also referred to as full-length precursor or full-length FGE protein, which
contains 374 amino acids. The amino acid sequences of the mature form (SEQ ID NO:5)
                                                 21

wild-type or naturally-occurring human FGE protein are shown in Table 2.

FGE protein. In some embodiments, an FGE enzyme may be a homologue or an analogue of

Cells Co-Expressing I2S and FGE
[00751           The present invention recognizes the need for the high-level, commercial
production of biologically active 12S using a cell culture system. Because a large number of
production factors can influence the selection of a specific host cell, nucleic acid molecules
disclosed in the present specification are directed toward a wide range of prokaryotic and
eukaryotic cells and/or cell lines including, without limitation, cell lines derived from bacteria
strains, yeast strains, insect cells, animal cells, mammalian cells and human cells. Aspects of
the present invention also provide for expression constructs and the generation of
recombinant stable cell lines useful for expressing naturally occurring, as well as, modified
12S and/or FGE proteins which are disclosed in the present specification. In addition, aspects
of the present invention also provide methods for producing cell lines that express 12S and
FGE using the disclosed nucleic acid sequences of the present specification.

Nucleic Acids Encoding I2S and/or FGE Proteins
[0076]          In some embodiments, nucleic acid molecules are provided comprising nucleic
acid sequences encoding for a recombinant gene of interest (herein referred to as a transgene)
such as an 12S and/or FGE protein described in various embodiments herein. In some
embodiments, the nucleic acid encoding a transgene may be modified to provide increased
expression of the encoded 12S and/or FGE protein, which is also referred to as codon
optimization. For example, the nucleic acid encoding a transgene can be modified by altering
the open reading frame for the coding sequence. As used herein, the term "open reading
frame" is synonymous with "ORF" and means any nucleotide sequence that is potentially
able to encode a protein, or a portion of a protein. An open reading frame usually begins with
a start codon (represented as, e.g. AUG for an RNA molecule and ATG in a DNA molecule
in the standard code) and is read in codon-triplets until the frame ends with a STOP codon
(represented as, e.g. UAA, UGA or UAG for an RNA molecule and TAA, TGA or TAG in a
DNA molecule in the standard code). As used herein, the term "codon" means a sequence of
three nucleotides in a nucleic acid molecule that specifies a particular amino acid during
protein synthesis; also called a triplet or codon-triplet. For example, of the 64 possible
codons in the standard genetic code, two codons, GAA and GAG encode the amino acid
Glutamine whereas the codons AAA and AAG specify the amino acid Lysine. In the
standard genetic code three codons are stop codons, which do not specify an amino acid. As
used herein, the term "synonymous codon" means any and all of the codons that code for a
single amino acid. Except for Methionine and Tryptophan, amino acids are coded by two to
six synonymous codons. For example, in the standard genetic code the four synonymous
codons that code for the amino acid Alanine are GCA, GCC, GCG and GCU, the two
synonymous codons that specify Glutamine are GAA and GAG and the two synonymous
codons that encode Lysine are AAA and AAG.
[00771          In some embodiments, a nucleic acid encoding the open reading frame of an
12S and/or FGE protein may be modified using standard codon optimization methods.
Various commercial algorithms for codon optimization are available and can be used to
practice the present invention. Typically, codon optimization does not alter the encoded
amino acid sequences. In some embodiments, codon optimization may lead to amino acids
                                                24

alteration such as substitution, deletion or insertion. Typically, such amino acid alteration
does not substantially alter the protein activity.

respectively are shown in SEQ ID NO:7 and 8 below.

acid sequence present in the heterologous host cell. A nucleotide change may also alter a
polymononucleotide region or an internal regulatory or structural site found within an 12S or
FGE sequence. Thus, a variety of modified or optimized nucleotide sequences are envisioned
including, without limitation, nucleic acid sequences providing increased expression of 12S
and/or FGE proteins in a prokaryotic cell; yeast cell; insect cell; and in a mammalian cell.
[0080]           Thus, in some embodiments, a nucleic acid encoding an 12S protein suitable
for the present invention has a nucleotide sequence at least 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%,
8 0%  , 8 5%, 9 0%, 9 1%, 9 2 %, 93%, 94%, 95%,   9 6 %, 97%, 9 8 %, 99% or more identical to
SEQ ID NO:7. In some embodiments, a nucleic acid encoding an FGE protein suitable for
the present invention has a nucleotide sequence at least 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%,
8 0%  , 8 5%, 9 0%, 9 1%, 9 2 %, 93%, 94%, 95%,   9 6 %, 97%, 9 8 %, 99% or more identical to
SEQ ID NO:8. Typically, a modified nucleic acid encodes an 12S and/or FGE protein with or
without amino acid sequence alteration. In the event there is amino acid alteration, such
alteration typically does not substantially alter the 12S or FGE protein activity.
Expression Vectors
[0081]           A nucleic acid sequence encoding an 12S and/or FGE protein as described in
the present application, can be molecularly cloned (inserted) into a suitable vector for
                                                 26

propagation or expression in a host cell. A wide variety of expression vectors can be used to
practice the present invention, including, without limitation, a prokaryotic expression vector;
a yeast expression vector; an insect expression vector and a mammalian expression vector.
Exemplary vectors suitable for the present invention include, but are not limited to, viral
based vectors (e.g., AAV based vectors, retrovirus based vectors, plasmid based vectors). In
some embodiments, nucleic acid sequences encoding an 12S and FGE proteins, respectively
can be inserted in separate vectors. In some embodiments, nucleic acid sequences encoding
an 12S and FGE proteins, respectively can be inserted in a same vector. Typically, a nucleic
acid encoding an 12S or FGE protein is operably linked to various regulatory sequences or
elements.
        Regulatory Sequences or Elements
[0082]          Various regulatory sequences or elements may be incorporated in an
expression vector suitable for the present invention. Exemplary regulatory sequences or
elements include, but are not limited to, promoters, enhancers, repressors or suppressors, 5'
untranslated (or non-coding) sequences, introns, 3' untranslated (or non-coding) sequences.
[0083]          As used herein, a "Promoter" or "Promoter sequence" is a DNA regulatory
region capable of binding an RNA polymerase in a cell (e.g., directly or through other
promoter bound proteins or substances) and initiating transcription of a coding sequence. A
promoter sequence is, in general, bound at its 3' terminus by the transcription initiation site
and extends upstream (5' direction) to include the minimum number of bases or elements
necessary to initiate transcription at any level. The promoter may be operably associated
with or operably linked to the expression control sequences, including enhancer and repressor
sequences or with a nucleic acid to be expressed. In some embodiments, the promoter may
be inducible. In some embodiments, the inducible promoter may be unidirectional or bio
directional. In some embodiments, the promoter may be a constitutive promoter. In some
embodiments, the promoter can be a hybrid promoter, in which the sequence containing the
transcriptional regulatory region is obtained from one source and the sequence containing the
transcription initiation region is obtained from a second source. Systems for linking control
elements to coding sequence within a transgene are well known in the art (general molecular
biological and recombinant DNA techniques are described in Sambrook, Fritsch, and
Maniatis, Molecular Cloning: A LaboratoryManual, Second Edition, Cold Spring Harbor
                                                 27

Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY, 1989, which is incorporated herein by reference).
Commercial vectors suitable for inserting a transgene for expression in various host cells
under a variety of growth and induction conditions are also well known in the art.
[0084]           In some embodiments, a specific promoter may be used to control expression
of the transgene in a mammalian host cell such as, but are not limited to, SRa-promoter
(Takebe et al., Molec. and Cell. Bio. 8:466-472 (1988)), the human CMV immediate early
promoter (Boshart et al., Cell 41:521-530 (1985); Foecking et al., Gene 45:101-105 (1986)),
human CMV promoter, the human CMV5 promoter, the murine CMV immediate early
promoter, the EF1-Ia-promoter, a hybrid CMV promoter for liver specific expression (e.g.,
made by conjugating CMV immediate early promoter with the transcriptional promoter
elements of either human a--1-antitrypsin (HAT) or albumin (HAL) promoter), or promoters
for hepatoma specific expression (e.g., wherein the transcriptional promoter elements of
either human albumin (HAL; about 1000 bp) or human a-1-antitrypsin (HAT, about 2000 bp)
are combined with a 145 long enhancer element of human a-1-microglobulin and bikunin
precursor gene (AMBP); HAL-AMBP and HAT-AMBP); the SV40 early promoter region
(Benoist at al., Nature 290:304-310 (1981)), the Orgyia pseudotsugata immediate early
promoter, the herpes thymidine kinase promoter (Wagner at al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA
78:1441-1445 (1981)); or the regulatory sequences of the metallothionein gene (Brinster et
al., Nature 296:39-42 (1982)). In some embodiments, the mammalian promoter is a is a
constitutive promoter such as, but not limited to, the hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase
(HPTR) promoter, the adenosine deaminase promoter, the pyruvate kinase promoter, the
beta-actin promoter as well as other constitutive promoters known to those of ordinary skill in
the art.
[0085]           In some embodiments, a specific promoter may be used to control expression
of a transgene in a prokaryotic host cell such as, but are not limited to, the p-lactamase
promoter (Villa-Komaroff et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 75:3727-3731 (1978)); the tac
promoter (DeBoer et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 80:21-25 (1983)); the T7 promoter, the
T3 promoter, the M13 promoter or the M16 promoter; in a yeast host cell such as, but are not
limited to, the GALl, GAL4 or GAL 10 promoter, the ADH (alcohol dehydrogenase)
promoter, PGK (phosphoglycerol kinase) promoter, alkaline phosphatase promoter,
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase III (TDH3) promoter, glyceraldehyde-3
phosphate dehydrogenase II (TDH2) promoter, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase I
                                               28

(TDH1) promoter, pyruvate kinase (PYK), enolase (ENO), or triose phosphate isomerase
(TPI).
[00861          In some embodiments, the promoter may be a viral promoter, many of which
are able to regulate expression of a transgene in several host cell types, including mammalian
cells. Viral promoters that have been shown to drive constitutive expression of coding
sequences in eukaryotic cells include, for example, simian virus promoters, herpes simplex
virus promoters, papilloma virus promoters, adenovirus promoters, human immunodeficiency
virus (HIV) promoters, Rous sarcoma virus promoters, cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoters,
the long terminal repeats (LTRs) of Moloney murine leukemia virus and other retroviruses,
the thymidine kinase promoter of herpes simplex virus as well as other viral promoters
known to those of ordinary skill in the art.
[00871          In some embodiments, the gene control elements of an expression vector may
also include 5' non-transcribing and 5' non-translating sequences involved with the initiation
of transcription and translation, respectively, such as a TATA box, capping sequence, CAAT
sequence, Kozak sequence and the like. Enhancer elements can optionally be used to
increase expression levels of a polypeptide or protein to be expressed. Examples of enhancer
elements that have been shown to function in mammalian cells include the SV40 early gene
enhancer, as described in Dijkema et al., EMBO J. (1985) 4: 761 and the enhancer/promoter
derived from the long terminal repeat (LTR) of the Rous Sarcoma Virus (RSV), as described
in Gorman et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA (1982b) 79:6777 and human cytomegalovirus,
as described in Boshart et al., Cell (1985) 41:521. Genetic control elements of an expression
vector will also include 3' non-transcribing and 3'non-translating sequences involved with
the termination of transcription and translation. Respectively, such as a poly
polyadenylation (polyA) signal for stabilization and processing of the 3' end of an mRNA
transcribed from the promoter. Poly A signals included, for example, the rabbit beta globin
polyA signal, bovine growth hormone polyA signal, chicken beta globin terminator/polyA
signal, or SV40 late polyA region.
        Selectable Markers
[0088]          Expression vectors will preferably but optionally include at least one
selectable marker. In some embodiments, the selectable maker is a nucleic acid sequence
                                                29

encoding a resistance gene operably linked to one or more genetic regulatory elements, to
bestow upon the host cell the ability to maintain viability when grown in the presence of a
cyctotoxic chemical and/or drug. In some embodiments, a selectable agent may be used to
maintain retention of the expression vector within the host cell. In some embodiments, the
selectable agent is may be used to prevent modification (i.e. methylation) and/or silencing of
the transgene sequence within the expression vector. In some embodiments, a selectable
agent is used to maintain episomal expression of the vector within the host cell. In some
embodiments, the selectable agent is used to promote stable integration of the transgene
sequence into the host cell genome. In some embodiments, an agent and/or resistance gene
may include, but is not limited to, methotrexate (MTX), dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR, U.S.

or chlorampenichol for a prokaryotic host cell; and URA3, LEU2, HIS3, LYS2, HIS4,
ADE8, CUPI or TRP1 for a yeast host cell.
[0089]           Expression vectors may be transfected, transformed or transduced into a host
cell. As used herein, the terms "transfection," "transformation" and "transduction" all refer
to the introduction of an exogenous nucleic acid sequence into a host cell. In some
embodiments, expression vectors containing nucleic acid sequences encoding for 12S and/or
FGE are transfected, transformed or transduced into a host cell at the same time. In some
embodiments, expression vectors containing nucleic acid sequences encoding for 12S and/or
FGE are transfected, transformed or transduced into a host cell sequentially. For example, a
vector encoding an 12S protein may be transfected, transformed or transduced into a host cell
first, followed by the transfection, transformation or transduction of a vector encoding an
FGE protein, and vice versa. Examples of transformation, transfection and transduction
methods, which are well known in the art, include liposome delivery, i.e., lipofectamineTM
(Gibco BRL) Method of Hawley-Nelson, Focus 15:73 (1193), electroporation, CaPO4
delivery method of Graham and van der Erb, Virology, 52:456-457 (1978), DEAE-Dextran
medicated delivery, microinjection, biolistic particle delivery, polybrene mediated delivery,
cationic mediated lipid delivery, transduction, and viral infection, such as, e.g., retrovirus,
lentivirus, adenovirus adeno-associated virus and Baculovirus (Insect cells). General aspects
of cell host transformations have been described in the art, such as by Axel in U.S. Pat. No.

[0090]           Once introduced inside cells, expression vectors may be integrated stably in
the genome or exist as extra-chromosomal constructs. Vectors may also be amplified and
multiple copies may exist or be integrated in the genome. In some embodiments, cells of the
invention may contain 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 20 or more copies of nucleic acids
encoding an 12S protein. In some embodiments, cells of the invention may contain 1, 2, 3, 4,
5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 20 or more copies of nucleic acids encoding an FGE protein. In some
embodiments, cells of the invention may contain multiple copies (e.g., 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,
10, 15, 20 or more) of nucleic acids encoding both 12S and FGE proteins.

[0091]           As used herein, the term "host cells" refers to cells that can be used to produce
recombinant 12S enzyme. In particular, host cells are suitable for producing recombinant 12S
enzyme at a large scale. Suitable host cells can be derived from a variety of organisms,
including, but not limited to, mammals, plants, birds (e.g., avian systems), insects, yeast, and
bacteria. In some embodiments, host cells are mammalian cells. In some embodiments, a
suitable host cell is not a endosomal acidification-deficient cell.

[0093]           Additionally, any number of commercially and non-commercially available
hybridoma cell lines that express polypeptides or proteins may be utilized in accordance with
the present invention. One skilled in the art will appreciate that hybridoma cell lines might
have different nutrition requirements and/or might require different culture conditions for
optimal growth and polypeptide or protein expression, and will be able to modify conditions
as needed.
        Non-Mammalian Cell Lines
[0094]           Any non-mammalian derived cell or cell type susceptible to cell culture, and

        Adaptable to Adherent vs Suspension Growth
[0095]           In certain embodiments, a host cell is selected for generating a cell line based
on certain preferable attributes or growth under particular conditions chosen for culturing
cells. It will be appreciated by one skilled in the art, such attributes may be ascertained based
on known characteristic and/or traits of an established line (i.e. a characterized commercially
available cell line) or though empirical evaluation. In some embodiments, a cell line may be
                                                 32

selected for its ability to grow on a feeder layer of cells. In some embodiments, a cell line
may be selected for its ability to grow in suspension. In some embodiments, a cell line may
be selected for its ability to grow as an adherent monolayer of cells. In some embodiments,
such cells can be used with any tissue culture vessel or any vessel treated with a suitable
adhesion substrate. In some embodiments, a suitable adhesion substrate is selected from the
group consisting of collagen (e.g. collagen I, II, II, or IV), gelatin, fibronectin, laminin,
vitronectin, fibrinogen, BD Matrigel',      basement membrane matrix, dermatan sulfate
proteoglycan, Poly-D-Lysine and/or combinations thereof. In some embodiments, an
adherent host cell may be selected and modified under specific growth conditions to grow in
suspension. Such methods of modifying an adherent cell to grown in suspension are known
in the art. For example, a cell may be conditioned to grow in suspension culture, by
gradually removing animal serum from the growth media over time.
Cell Line Selection and Evaluation
[0096]           According to the present invention, cells engineered to express recombinant
12S protein are selected for its ability to produce the recombinant 12S protein at commercially
viable scale. In particular, engineered cells according to the present invention are able to
produce recombinant 12S at a high level and/or with high enzymatic activity. In some
embodiments, desirable cells, once cultivated under a cell culture condition (e.g., a standard
large scale suspension or adherent culture condition), can produce 12S enzyme in an amount
of or greater than about 5 picogram/cell/day (e.g., greater than about 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35,
40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, or 100 picogram/cell/day). In some
embodiments, desired cells, once cultivated under a cell culture condition (e.g., a standard
large scale suspension or adherent culture condition), are able to produce 12S enzyme in an
amount ranging from about 5-100 picogram/cell/day (e.g., about 5-90 picogram/cell/day,
about 5-80 picogram/cell/day, about 5-70 picogram/cell/day, about 5-60 picogram/cell/day,
about 5-50 picogram/cell/day, about 5-40 picogram/cell/day, about 5-30 picogram/cell/day,
about 10-90 picogram/cell/day, about 10-80 picogram/cell/day, about 10-70
picogram/cell/day, about 10-60 picogram/cell/day, about 10-50 picogram/cell/day, about 10
40 picogram/cell/day, about 10-30 picogram/cell/day, about 20-90 picogram/cell/day, about
20-80 picogram/cell/day, about 20-70 picogram/cell/day, about 20-60 picogram/cell/day,
about 20-50 picogram/cell/day, about 20-40 picogram/cell/day, about 20-30
picogram/cell/day).
                                                 33

[00971           As discussed above, typically, the enzyme activity of 12S is influenced by a
post-translational modification of a conserved cysteine (e.g., at amino acid 59) to
formylglycine. This post-translational modification generally occurs in the endoplasmic
reticulum during protein synthesis and is catalyzed by FGE. The enzyme activity of 12S is
typically positively correlated with the extent to which the 12S has the formylglycine
modification. For example, an 12S preparation that has a relatively high amount of
formylglycine modification typically has a relatively high specific enzyme activity; whereas
an 12S preparation that has a relatively low amount of formylglycine modification typically
has a relatively low specific enzyme activity.
[0098]           It is further contemplated that the ratio between the 12S and FGE protein or
mRNA may also affect formylglycine modification on the produced recombinant 12S protein.
In some embodiments, the 12S and FGE expressed in a desired cell have different protein
and/or mRNA expression levels. In some embodiments, the 12S protein or mRNA expression
level is at least 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, 5.0,
5.5, 6.0, 6.5, 7.0, 7.5, 8, 9, or 10-fold higher than the protein or mRNA level of FGE. In
some embodiments the recombinant FGE protein or mRNA expression level is at least 0.1,
0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, 5.0, 5.5, 6.0, 6.5, 7.0,
7.5, 8, 9, or 10-fold higher than the protein or mRNA level of 12S.
[0099]           In some embodiments, desirable cells, once cultivated under a cell culture
condition (e.g., a standard large scale suspension or adherent culture condition), can produce
12S protein comprising at least about 50% (e.g., at least about 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%,
80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, or 100%) conversion of the cysteine residue
corresponding to Cys59 of SEQ ID NO: I to Ca-formylglycine (FGly). In some
embodiments, desirable cells, once cultivated under a cell culture condition (e.g., a standard
large scale suspension or adherent culture condition), can produce 12S enzyme comprising at
least about 50% (e.g., at least about 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%,
97%, 98%, 99%, or 100%) conversion of the cysteine residue corresponding to Cys59 of
SEQ ID NO: I to Ca-formylglycine (FGly) and in an amount of or greater than about 5
picogram/cell/day (e.g., greater than about 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70,
75, 80, 85, 90, 95, or 100 picogram/cell/day).
                                                     34

        FGIy Conversion Percentage
10100]           Various methods are known and can be used to determine the FGly conversion
percentage. Generally, the percentage of formylglycine conversion (%FG) can be calculated
using the following formula:
                                  Number of active 12S molecules
  %FG (of DS) =                                                                         x 00
                         Number of total (active+inactive) 12S molecules
For example 50% FG means half of the purified recombinant 12S is enzymatically inactive
without any therapeutic effect. Various methods may be used to calculate %FG. For
example, peptide mapping may be used. Briefly, an I2S protein may be digested into short
peptides using a protease (e g, trypsin or ehymotrypsin). Short peptides may be separated
and characterized using chromatography (e.g, HPLC) such that the nature and quantity of
each peptide (iii particular the peptide containing the position corresponding to position 59 of
the mature human 12S) may be determined, as compared to a control (e.g., an 12S protein
without FGly conversion or an 12S protein with 100% FGly conversion). The amount of
peptides containing FMly (corresponding to number of active 12S molecules) and the total
amount of peptides with both FGly and Cys (corresponding to number of total 12S molecules)
may be determined and the ratio reflecting %FG calculated.
        Specific Activity
10101]           As discussed above, typically, the enzyme activity of 12S is influenced by a
post-franslational modification of a conserved cyst6ne (e.g., at amino acid 59) to
formylglycine. Thus, the enzyme activity of 12S is typically positively correlated with the
extent to which the 12S has the formylglycine modification. For example, an 12S preparation
that has a relatively high amount of formylglycine modification typically has a relatively high
specific enzyme activity; whereas an 12S preparation that has a relatively low amount of
formylglycine modification typically has a relatively low specific enzyme activity.
[0102]           As can be appreciated by one skilled in the art, the enzymatic activity of
recombinant 12S protein produced by cells of the present invention may be measured by
various in vitro and in viva assays. In some embodiments, a desired enzymatic activity, as
                                                35

measured by in vitro sulfate release activity assay using heparin disaccharide as substrate, of
the produced recombinant 12S protein is at least about 20 U/mg, 30 U/mg, 40 U/mg, 50
U/mg, 60 U/mg, 70 U/mg, 80 U/mg, 90 U/mg, or 100 U/mg. In some embodiments, a
desired enzymatic activity, as measured by in vitro sulfate release activity assay using heparin
disaccharide as substrate, of the produced recombinant 12S protein ranges from about 20-100
U/mg (e.g., about 20-90 U/mg, about 20-80 U/mg, about 20-70 U/mg, about 20-60 U/mg,
about 20-50 U/mg, about 20-40 U/mg, about 20-30 U/mg, about 30-100 U/mg, about 30-90
U/mg, about 30-80 U/mg, about 30-70 U/mg, about 30-60 U/mg, about 30-50 U/mg, about 30
40 U/mg, about 40-100 U/mg, about 40-90 U/mg, about 40-80 U/mg, about 40-70 U/mg,
about 40-60 U/mg, about 40-50 U/mg). Exemplary conditions for performing in vitro sulfate
release activity assay using heparin disaccharide as substrate are provided below. Typically,
this assay measures the ability of 12S to release sulfate ions from a naturally derived
substrate, heparin diasaccharide. The released sulfate may be quantified by ion
chromatography. In some cases, ion chromatography is equipped with a conductivity
detector. As a non-limiting example, samples are first buffer exchanged to 10 mM Na
acetate, pH 6 to remove inhibition by phosphate ions in the formulation buffer. Samples are
then diluted to 0.075 mg/ml with reaction buffer (10 mM Na acetate, pH 4.4) and incubated
for 2 hrs at 37'C with heparin disaccharide at an enzyme to substrate ratio of 0.3 pg 12S/100
pg substrate in a 30 ptL reaction volume. The reaction is then stopped by heating the samples
at 100 0 C for 3 min. The analysis is carried out using a Dionex IonPac AS 18 analytical
column with an IonPac AG18 guard column. An isocratic method is used with 30 mM
potassium hydroxide at 1.0 mL/min for 15 minutes. The amount of sulfate released by the
12S sample is calculated from the linear regression analysis of sulfate standards in the range
of 1.7 to 16.0 nmoles. The reportable value is expressed as Units per mg protein, where 1
unit is defined as 1 moles of sulfate released per hour and the protein concentration is
determined by A280 measurements.
[0103]           In some embodiments, the enzymatic activity of recombinant 12S protein
produced by cells of the present invention may also be determined using various other
methods known in the art such as, for example, 4-MUF assay which measures hydrolysis of
4-methylumbelliferyl-sulfate to sulfate and naturally fluorescent 4-methylumbelliferone (4
MUF). In some embodiments, a desired enzymatic activity, as measured by in vitro 4-MUF
assay, of the produced recombinant 12S protein is at least about 2 U/mg, 4 U/mg, 6 U/mg, 8
U/mg, 10 U/mg, 12 U/mg, 14 U/mg, 16 U/mg, 18 U/mg, or 20 U/mg. In some embodiments,
                                                36

a desired enzymatic activity, as measured by in vitro 4-MUF assay, of the produced
recombinant 12S protein ranges from about 0-50 U/mg (e.g., about 0-40 U/mg, about 0-30
U/mg, about 0-20 U/mg, about 0-10 U/mg, about 2-50 U/mg, about 2-40 U/mg, about 2-30
U/mg, about 2-20 U/mg, about 2-10 U/mg, about 4-50 U/mg, about 4-40 U/mg, about 4-30
U/mg, about 4-20 U/mg, about 4-10 U/mg, about 6-50 U/mg, about 6-40 U/mg, about 6-30
U/mg, about 6-20 U/mg, about 6-10 U/mg). Exemplary conditions for performing in vitro 4
MUF assay are provided below. Typically, a 4-MUF assay measures the ability of an 12S
protein to hydrolyze 4-methylumbelliferyl-sulfate (4-MUF-SO4) to sulfate and naturally
fluorescent 4-methylumbelliferone (4-MUF). One milliunit of activity is defined as the
quantity of enzyme required to convert one nanomole of 4-MUF-SO4 to 4-MUF in one
minute at 37 0 C. Typically, the mean fluorescence units (MFU) generated by 12S test samples
with known activity can be used to generate a standard curve, which can be used to calculate
the enzymatic activity of a sample of interest.

Cell Culture Medium and Condition
[0104]          Various cell culture medium and conditions may be used to produce a
recombinant 12S protein using engineered cells according to the present invention. For
example, a recombinant 12S protein may be produced in serum-containing or serum-free
medium. In some embodiments, a recombinant 12S protein is produced in serum-free
medium. In some embodiments, a recombinant 12S protein is produced in an animal free
medium, i.e., a medium that lacks animal-derived components. In some embodiments, a
recombinant 12S protein is produced in a chemically defined medium. As used herein, the
term "chemically-defined nutrient medium" refers to a medium of which substantially all of
the chemical components are known. In some embodiments, a chemically defined nutrient
medium is free of animal-derived components such as serum, serum derived proteins (e.g.,
albumin or fetuin), and other components. In some cases, a chemically-defined medium
comprises one or more proteins (e.g., protein growth factors or cytokines.) In some cases, a
chemically-defined nutrient medium comprises one or more protein hydrolysates. In other
cases, a chemically-defined nutrient medium is a protein-free media, i.e., a serum-free media
that contains no proteins, hydrolysates or components of unknown composition.
[0105]          In some embodiments, a chemically defined medium may be supplemented by
one or more animal derived components. Such animal derived components include, but are
not limited to, fetal calf serum, horse serum, goat serum, donkey serum, human serum, and
serum derived proteins such as albumins (e.g., bovine serum albumin or human serum
albumin).
[0106]          Various cell culture conditions may be used to produce recombinant 12S
proteins at large scale including, but not limited to, roller bottle cultures, bioreactor batch
cultures and bioreactor fed-batch cultures. In some embodiments, recombinant 12S protein is
produced by cells cultured in suspension. In some embodiments, recombinant 12S protein is
produced by adherent cells.
[01071          Exemplary cell media and culture conditions are described in the Examples
sections. Additional exemplary methods and compositions for producing recombinant 12S
protein are described in the provisional application entitled "Methods and Compositions for
                                                38

Purification of Expressed I2S Protein
[01081          Various methods may be used to purify or isolate 12S protein produced
according to various methods described herein. In some embodiments, the expressed 12S
protein is secreted into the medium and thus cells and other solids may be removed, as by
centrifugation or filtering for example, as a first step in the purification process.
Alternatively or additionally, the expressed 12S protein is bound to the surface of the host
cell. In this embodiment, the host cells expressing the polypeptide or protein are lysed for
purification. Lysis of mammalian host cells can be achieved by any number of means well
known to those of ordinary skill in the art, including physical disruption by glass beads and
exposure to high pH conditions.
[0109]          The 12S protein may be isolated and purified by standard methods including,
but not limited to, chromatography (e.g., ion exchange, affinity, size exclusion, and
hydroxyapatite chromatography), gel filtration, centrifugation, or differential solubility,
ethanol precipitation or by any other available technique for the purification of proteins (See,
e.g., Scopes, Protein Purification Principles and Practice 2nd Edition, Springer-Verlag, New
York, 1987; Higgins, S. J. and Hames, B. D. (eds.), Protein Expression: A Practical
Approach, Oxford Univ Press, 1999; and Deutscher, M. P., Simon, M. I., Abelson, J. N.
(eds.), Guide to Protein Purification: Methods in Enzymology (Methods in Enzymology
Series, Vol 182), Academic Press, 1997, all incorporated herein by reference). For
immunoaffinity chromatography in particular, the protein may be isolated by binding it to an
affinity column comprising antibodies that were raised against that protein and were affixed
to a stationary support. Alternatively, affinity tags such as an influenza coat sequence, poly
histidine, or glutathione-S-transferase can be attached to the protein by standard recombinant
techniques to allow for easy purification by passage over the appropriate affinity column.
Protease inhibitors such as phenyl methyl sulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), leupeptin, pepstatin or
aprotinin may be added at any or all stages in order to reduce or eliminate degradation of the
polypeptide or protein during the purification process. Protease inhibitors are particularly
desired when cells must be lysed in order to isolate and purify the expressed polypeptide or
protein.

Additional purification methods are described in the provisional application entitled
"Purification of Recombinant 12S Protein" filed on herewith on even date, the entire
disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference.
Pharmaceutical Composition and Administration
[0111]           Purified recombinant 12S protein may be administered to a Hunter Syndrome
patient in accordance with known methods. For example, purified recombinant 12S protein
may be delivered intravenously, subcutaneously, intramuscularly, parenterally, transdermally,
or transmucosally (e.g., orally or nasally)).
[0112]           In some embodiments, a recombinant 12S or a pharmaceutical composition
containing the same is administered to a subject by intravenous administration.
[0113]           In some embodiments, a recombinant 12S or a pharmaceutical composition
containing the same is administered to a subject by intrathecal administration. As used
herein, the term "intrathecal administration" or "intrathecal injection" refers to an injection
into the spinal canal (intrathecal space surrounding the spinal cord). Various techniques may
be used including, without limitation, lateral cerebroventricular injection through a burrhole
or cistemal or lumbar puncture or the like. In some embodiments, "intrathecal
administration" or "intrathecal delivery" according to the present invention refers to IT
administration or delivery via the lumbar area or region, i.e., lumbar IT administration or
delivery. As used herein, the term "lumbar region" or "lumbar area" refers to the area
between the third and fourth lumbar (lower back) vertebrae and, more inclusively, the L2-S1
region of the spine.
[0114]           In some embodiments, a recombinant 12S or a pharmaceutical composition
containing the same is administered to the subject by subcutaneous (i.e., beneath the skin)
administration. For such purposes, the formulation may be injected using a syringe.
However, other devices for administration of the formulation are available such as injection
devices (e.g., the Inject-ease TM and Genject TM  devices); injector pens (such as the
GenPen TM); needleless devices (e.g., MediJectorM and BioJector TM); and subcutaneous patch
delivery systems.
                                                 40

[0115]           In some embodiments, intrathecal administration may be used in conjunction
with other routes of administration (e.g., intravenous, subcutaneously, intramuscularly,
parenterally, transdermally, or transmucosally (e.g., orally or nasally)).
[01161           The present invention contemplates single as well as multiple administrations
of a therapeutically effective amount of a recombinant 12S or a pharmaceutical composition
containing the same described herein. A recombinant 12S or a pharmaceutical composition
containing the same can be administered at regular intervals, depending on the nature,
severity and extent of the subject's condition (e.g., a lysosomal storage disease). In some
embodiments, a therapeutically effective amount of a recombinant 12S or a pharmaceutical
composition containing the same may be administered periodically at regular intervals (e.g.,
once every year, once every six months, once every five months, once every three months,
bimonthly (once every two months), monthly (once every month), biweekly (once every two
weeks), weekly, daily or continuously).
[01171           A recombinant 12S or a pharmaceutical composition containing the same can
be formulated with a physiologically acceptable carrier or excipient to prepare a
pharmaceutical composition. The carrier and therapeutic agent can be sterile. The
formulation should suit the mode of administration.
[0118]            Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include but are not limited to
water, salt solutions (e.g., NaCl), saline, buffered saline, alcohols, glycerol, ethanol, gum
arabic, vegetable oils, benzyl alcohols, polyethylene glycols, gelatin, carbohydrates such as
lactose, amylose or starch, sugars such as mannitol, sucrose, or others, dextrose, magnesium
stearate, talc, silicic acid, viscous paraffin, perfume oil, fatty acid esters,
hydroxymethylcellulose, polyvinyl pyrolidone, etc., as well as combinations thereof. The
pharmaceutical preparations can, if desired, be mixed with auxiliary agents (e.g., lubricants,
preservatives, stabilizers, wetting agents, emulsifiers, salts for influencing osmotic pressure,
buffers, coloring, flavoring and/or aromatic substances and the like) which do not
deleteriously react with the active compounds or interference with their activity. In some
embodiments, a water-soluble carrier suitable for intravenous administration is used.
[0119]           The composition or medicament, if desired, can also contain minor amounts of
wetting or emulsifying agents, or pH buffering agents. The composition can be a liquid
solution, suspension, emulsion, tablet, pill, capsule, sustained release formulation, or powder.
                                                   41

The composition can also be formulated as a suppository, with traditional binders and carriers
such as triglycerides. Oral formulation can include standard carriers such as pharmaceutical
grades of mannitol, lactose, starch, magnesium stearate, polyvinyl pyrollidone, sodium
saccharine, cellulose, magnesium carbonate, etc.
[0120]           The composition or medicament can be formulated in accordance with the
routine procedures as a pharmaceutical composition adapted for administration to human
beings. For example, in some embodiments, a composition for intravenous administration
typically is a solution in sterile isotonic aqueous buffer. Where necessary, the composition
may also include a solubilizing agent and a local anesthetic to ease pain at the site of the
injection. Generally, the ingredients are supplied either separately or mixed together in unit
dosage form, for example, as a dry lyophilized powder or water free concentrate in a
hermetically sealed container such as an ampule or sachette indicating the quantity of active
agent. Where the composition is to be administered by infusion, it can be dispensed with an
infusion bottle containing sterile pharmaceutical grade water, saline or dextrose/water.
Where the composition is administered by injection, an ampule of sterile water for injection
or saline can be provided so that the ingredients may be mixed prior to administration.
[0121]           As used herein, the term "therapeutically effective amount" is largely
determined base on the total amount of the therapeutic agent contained in the pharmaceutical
compositions of the present invention. Generally, a therapeutically effective amount is
sufficient to achieve a meaningful benefit to the subject (e.g., treating, modulating, curing,
preventing and/or ameliorating the underlying disease or condition). For example, a
therapeutically effective amount may be an amount sufficient to achieve a desired therapeutic
and/or prophylactic effect, such as an amount sufficient to modulate lysosomal enzyme
receptors or their activity to thereby treat such lysosomal storage disease or the symptoms
thereof (e.g., a reduction in or elimination of the presence or incidence of "zebra bodies" or
cellular vacuolization following the administration of the compositions of the present
invention to a subject). Generally, the amount of a therapeutic agent (e.g., a recombinant
lysosomal enzyme) administered to a subject in need thereof will depend upon the
characteristics of the subject. Such characteristics include the condition, disease severity,
general health, age, sex and body weight of the subject. One of ordinary skill in the art will be
readily able to determine appropriate dosages depending on these and other related factors.
                                                 42

In addition, both objective and subjective assays may optionally be employed to identify
optimal dosage ranges.
 [0122]          A therapeutically effective amount is commonly administered in a dosing
regimen that may comprise multiple unit doses. For any particular therapeutic protein, a
therapeutically effective amount (and/or an appropriate unit dose within an effective dosing
regimen) may vary, for example, depending on route of administration, on combination with
other pharmaceutical agents. Also, the specific therapeutically effective amount (and/or unit
dose) for any particular patient may depend upon a variety of factors including the disorder
being treated and the severity of the disorder; the activity of the specific pharmaceutical agent
employed; the specific composition employed; the age, body weight, general health, sex and
diet of the patient; the time of administration, route of administration, and/or rate of excretion
or metabolism of the specific fusion protein employed; the duration of the treatment; and like
factors as is well known in the medical arts.
 [0123]          Additional exemplary pharmaceutical compositions and administration
methods are described in PCT Publication W02011/163649 entitled "Methods and
Compositions for CNS Delivery of Iduronate-2-Sulfatase;" and provisional application serial
no. 61/618,638 entitled "Subcutaneous administration of iduronate 2 sulfatase" filed on
March 30, 2012, the entire disclosures of both of which are hereby incorporated by reference.
 [0124]          It is to be further understood that for any particular subject, specific dosage
regimens should be adjusted over time according to the individual need and the professional
judgment of the person administering or supervising the administration of the enzyme
replacement therapy and that dosage ranges set forth herein are exemplary only and are not
intended to limit the scope or practice of the claimed invention.

                                           EXAMPLES
Example 1. Generation of Optimized Cell Line Co-expressing recombinant 12S and
FGE
[0125]           This example illustrates an exemplary optimized cell line co-expressing
recombinant 12S and FGE that can be used to produce recombinant 12S protein. It will be
clear to one skilled in the art, that a number of alternative approaches, expression vectors and
cloning techniques are available.
[0126]           A typical mature form of human iduronate-2-sulfatase enzyme (12S) is a 525
amino acid glycoprotein that undergoes extensive processing and post translational
modification for enzyme activation, such as glycosylation and cysteine conversion to
formylglycine (Figure 1). In mammalian cells, conserved cysteine residues within the 12S
(i.e., at amino acid 59) enzyme are converted to formylglycine by the formylglycine
generating enzyme (FGE). The conversion of cysteine to formylglycine within the active site
of the 12S enzyme is an important step in generating the active form of the human sulfatase
enzyme. The purpose of this experiment was to engineer an optimized human cell line co
expressing 12S and FGE for generating active recombinant 12S.
[01271           Figure 2 illustrates a number of exemplary construct designs for co-expression
of 12S and FGE. For example, expression units of 12S and FGE can be located on separate
vectors and the separate vectors can be co-transfected or transfected separately (Figure 2A).
Alternatively, expression units of 12S and FGE can be located on the same vector (Figure
2B). In one configuration, 12S and FGE can be on the same vector but under the control of
separate promoters, also referred to as separate cistrons (Figure 2B(1)). Alternatively, 12S
and FGE can be designed as transcriptionally linked cistrons, that is, 12S and FGE are
designed as one open reading frame under the control of a same promoter (Figure 2B(2)).
Typically, an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) is designed to allow cap independent
translation initiation of the messenger RNA (Figure 2B(2)).
[0128]           A human cell line was engineered to co-express human 12S protein with the
amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:2 and human formylglycine generating enzyme
(FGE) with the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:6.

[0130]           Both 12S- and FGE- encoding nucleic acid sequences are controlled by a
human CMV promoter. Translation of 12S mRNA results in synthesis of a 550 amino acid
full length 12S protein (SEQ ID NO:2), which includes a 25 amino acid signal peptide. The
signal peptide is removed and a soluble enzyme is secreted from the cell.
[0131]           The bacterial neomycin phosphotransferase (neo) coding sequence and/or
Blasticidin S Deaminase (BSD) gene were used to allow for selection of transfected cells
using the neomycin analog G418 and/or blasticidin, respectively. In addition, the mouse
dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) gene was used on the 12S- and/or FGE-encoding vector(s) to
allow for isolation of cell lines containing increased copies of the 12S- and/or FGE-encoding
sequences by methotrexate (MTX) selection.
[0132]           Cells producing 12S were isolated and subjected to appropriate drug selection
to isolate cells with an increased number of copies of the transfected 12S and/or FGE genes.
Quantification of 12S was performed by ELISA.
                                                46

[01331          The cell population was also subjected to step-wise selection in methotrexate
(MTX) to isolate cells with increased 12S productivity. 12S productivity was monitored
during MTX selection by ELISA.
[0134]          After several rounds of propagation, several 12S producing clones were then
subjected to suspension adaptation in serum-free media through a stepwise reduction from
DMEM containing 10% calf serum to serum free chemically defined media. Several
individual clonal populations were established through limited dilution cloning. Colonies
were screened by 12S enzyme activity assay and ELISA. Two stable cell lines 2D and 4D
showed high percent viability and robust expression of 12S and were selected for further
development.
Example 2. Evaluation of Stable Cell Lines Co-expressing 12S and FGE
[0135]          Additional experiments were carried out to characterize two cell lines 2D and
4D co-expressing 12S and FGE.
Specific Activity
[0136]          First specific activity of the 12S enzyme was evaluated. 12S enzyme produced
from the 2D and 4D cell lines were analyzed for specific activity using a fluorescence based
4-MUF assay. Briefly, the assay measures the hydrolysis of 12S substrate 4
methylumbelliferyl-sulfate (4-MUF-SO4). Upon cleavage of the 4-MUF-SO4 substrate by
12S, the molecule is converted to sulfate and naturally fluorescent 4-methylumbelliferone (4
MUF). As a result, 12S enzyme activity can be determined by evaluating the overall change
in fluorescent signal over time. For this experiment, purified 12S enzyme produced from the
12S-AF 2D and 4D human cell lines were incubated with a solution of 4-methylumbelliferyl
sulfate (4-MUF-SO4), Potassium Salt, Sigma Cat. # M-7133). Calibration of the assay was
performed using a series of control reference samples, using commercially available 12S
enzyme diluted at 1:100, 1:200 and 1:20,000 of the stock solution. The enzymatic assay was
run at 37'C and assayed using a calibrated fluorometer. Using the fluorescence values
obtained for each reference standard, the percent coefficient of variation was determined
using the following equation:
                                                  47

            %CV = S tan dardDeviationof Raw FluorescencValues(N = 3) X100%
                                  Averagel FluorescenceValue
[0137]          The percent CV values were then used to calculate the Corrected Average
Fluorescence for each sample, in order to determine the reportable enzyme activity, expressed
in mU/mL using the following formula:
          mU /mL = (CFU 1 nmolel/L             1L )2.11mL        l hour    1mU)(DF)
                                10FU )( 103mL 0.0lmL             60min    nmole
                CFU = Negative corrected average fluorescence
                DF - Dilution Factor
[0138]          One milliunit of activity is the quantity of enzyme required to convert 1
nanomole of 4-methylumbelliferyl-sulfate to 4-methylumbelliferone in 1 minute at 37'C.
PercentFormylglycine Conversion
[0139]          Peptide mapping can be used to determine Percent FGly conversion. 12S
activation requires Cysteine (corresponding to position 59 of mature human 12S) to
formylglycine conversion by formylglycine generating enzyme (FGE) as shown below:
            (HO)
             HS                                Formylglycine          O    H
         XxxXxxCysXxxProXxxArgXxxXxx                             XxxXxxFGlyXxxProXxxArgXxxXxx
               (Ser) (Ala)                  Generating enzyme                   (Ala)
Therefore, the percentage of formylglycine conversion (%FG) can be calculated using the
following formula:
                                Number of active 12S molecules
  %FG (of DS) =                                                                        x100
                        Number of total (active+inactive) 12S molecules
[0140]          For example 50% FG means half of the purified recombinant 12S is
enzymatically inactive without any therapeutic effect.
                                                 48

[01411          Peptide mapping was used to calculate %FG. Briefly, a recombinant 12S
protein was digested into short peptides using a protease (e.g., trypsin or chymotrypsin).
Short peptides were separated and characterized using HPLC. The peptide containing the
position corresponding to position 59 of the mature human 12S was characterized to
determine if the Cys at position 59 was converted to a FGly as compared to a control (e.g., an
12S protein without FGly conversion or an 12S protein with 100% FGly conversion). The
amount of peptides containing FGly (corresponding to number of active 12S molecules) and
the total amount of peptides with both FGly and Cys (corresponding to number of total 12S
molecules) may be determined based on the corresponding peak areas and the ratio reflecting
%FG was calculated.
Correlationbetween PercentageFGly Conversion and Specific Activity
[0142]          Exemplary correlation between percentage FGly conversion and specific
activity is shown in Figure 3. As can be seen, the data suggest that a higher percentage of
formylglycine conversion results in higher 12S enzyme activity.
Glycan Map
[0143]          The glycan composition of recombinant 12S protein produced by cell line 2D
and 4D was determined. Quantification of the glycan composition was performed, using
anion exchange chromatography. As described below, the glycan map of recombinant 12S
generated under these conditions consists of seven peak groups, eluting according to an
increasing amount of negative charges, at least partly derived from sialic acid and mannose
6-phosphate glycoforms resulting from enzymatic digest. Briefly, purified recombinant 12S
obtained using the serum-free cell culture method (12S-AF 2D Serum-free and 12S-AF 4D
Serum-free) and reference recombinant 12S produced, were treated with either (1) purified
neuraminidase enzyme (isolated from Arthrobacter Ureafaciens (10 mU/pL), Roche
Biochemical (Indianapolis, IN), Cat. # 269 611 (1U/100 pL)) for the removal of sialic acid
residues, (2) alkaline phosphatase for 2 hours at 371'C for complete release of mannose-6
phosphate residues, (3) alkaline phosphatase + neuraminidase, or (4) no treatment. Each
enzymatic digest was analyzed by High Performance Anion Exchange Chromatography with
Pulsed Amperometric Detection (HPAE-PAD) using a CarboPac PAl Analytical Column
                                               49

equipped with a Dionex CarboPac PAl Guard Column. A series of sialic acid and mannose
6-phosphate standards in the range of 0.4 to 2.0 nmoles were run for each assay. An isocratic
method using 48 mM sodium acetate in 100 mM sodium hydroxide was run for a minimum
of 15 minutes at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min at ambient column temperature to elute each peak.
The data generated from each individual run, for both the 12S-AF and reference 12S samples,
were each combined into a single chromatograph to represent the glycan map for each
respective recombinant protein. As indicated in Figure 4, an exemplary glycan map for 12S
produced by cell line 2D and 4D displayed representative elution peaks (in the order of
elution) constituting neutrals, mono-, disialyated, monophosphorylated, trisialyated and
hybrid (monosialyated and capped mannose-6-phosphate), tetrasialylated and hybrid
(disilaylated and capped mannose-6-phosphate) and diphosphorylated glycans.
Example 3. Serum-free Suspension Cell Culture
[0144]          This example demonstrates that a large scale serum free suspension culture
may be developed to cultivate an optimized cell line to produce recombinant 12S.
Serum-free suspension cell culture system
[0145]          Briefly, a seed culture was established using the 2D or 4D cell line of Example
1. Cells were transferred to a 250 mL tissue culture shake flask containing serum-free
chemically defined expansion medium supplemented with MTX for selection, adjusted with
sodium bicarbonate to a pH of 7.3 and grown at 37'C at 5% C02 for several days. Once the
culture reached a sufficient cell density and viability, the initial seed culture was used to
inoculate the first of a series of step-wise cell culture expansions in 500 mL tissue culture
shake flasks followed by 1 L tissue culture shake flasks.
[0146]          A batch culture expansion was performed by transferring each of the IL
cultures into a 1OL Cellbag bioreactor@ (Wave Europe), and adding expansion medium.
After reaching a sufficient cell density, new expansion medium was added and the cells
grown to a sufficient density. The 1OL Cellbag was transferred to a Wave bioreactor@
system (Wave Europe) and culture conditions were modified to allow for growth under
continuous medium perfusion. Expansion growth medium was delivered and samples were
collected for off-line metabolite analysis of pH, glutamine, glutamate, glucose, ammonium,
lactate, pCO2 and osmolarity.
                                                  50

[01471          Upon reaching a sufficient cell density, the entire 1OL cell culture was
transferred to a 50L Wave Cellbag bioreactor@, containing fresh expansion medium, and
grown to a sufficient cell density using a Wave bioreactor@ system.
[0148]          Cell expansion was next performed using a 200L disposable bioreactor and
centrifuge perfusion device (Centritech@ CELL II unit, Pneumatic Scale Corporation), which
was designed to concentrate cells and clarify media for recycling during perfusion mediated
cell culture. Expansion medium (adjusted to pH 7.10) was inoculated with a portion of the
50L culture and grown to a sufficient cell density.
[0149]          Next a portion of the 200L culture was used to seed a 2000L disposable
bioreactor and centrifuge perfusion device (Centritech@ CELL II unit, Pneumatic Scale
Corporation) in production medium (adjusted to pH 7.20). Cells were grown under batch
growth conditions. Following the two day growth, conditions were adjusted for continuous
perfusion, until a transition phase was reached. Cells were grown under perfusion growth
conditions for the 24 hour transition phase.
[0150]          For the production phase, two Centritech CELL II units were used.
Production phase was started approximately 24 hours after the start of the transition phase
and maintained for a desired period, by regulating the bleed rate.
