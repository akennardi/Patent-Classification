PARAMETRIC DRAW-DOWN SYSTEM FOR RISKS SHARING OF
CRITICAL ILLNESS RISK AND CORRESPONDING METHOD THEREOF
ABSTRACT
Proposed area parametric, event-driven critical illness insurance system based on a resource
pooling system (1) and method for risk sharing of critical illness risks of a variable number of risk
exposure components (21, 22, 23) by providing a dynamic self-sufficient risk protection for the risk
exposure components (21, 22, 23) by means of the resource-pooling system (1). The resource
pooling system (1) comprises an assembly module (5) to process risk-related component data
(211, 221, 231) and to provide the likelihood (212, 222, 232) of said risk exposure for one or a
plurality of the pooled risk exposure components (21, 22, 23, ... ) based on the risk-related
component data (211, 221, 231). The risk exposure components (21, 22, 23) are connected to
the resource-pooling system (1) for the pooling of their risks and resources, and wherein the
resource-pooling system (1) comprises an event-driven core-engine (3) with critical illness triggers
(31, 32, 33) triggering in a patient data flow pathway (213, 223, 233) to provide risk protection for
a specific risk exposure component (21, 22, 23). The operation of the resource pooling system (1)
is supported by a parametric draw-down risk-cover which can additionally be related to
multiple occurrences of critical illness parameters 71,72,73 triggered in the related patient data
flow pathway (213, 223, 233).

PARAMETRIC DRAW-DOWN SYSTEM FOR RISKS SHARING OF
CRITICAL ILLNESS RISK AND CORRESPONDING METHOD THEREOF
              The present application is a divisional application of Australian patent application
no. 2013403054, the content of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
              Meld of the Invention
              The present invention relates to critical illness insurance systems for providing risk
sharing of critical illness risks of a variable number of risk exposure components by providing a
dynamic self-sufficient risk protection for the risk exposure components by means of the critical
illness insurance system. In particular, the invention relates to automated event-driven systems
triggering on the patient dataflow pathway.
              Backgmund of the Invention
              These days, there is significant risk exposure related to many aspects in life and non
life sectors. Risk exposed units as any kinds of objects, individuals, corporate bodies and/or legal
entities, necessarily are confronted with many forms of active and passive risk management to
hedge and protect against the risk of certain losses and events. In the prior art, one way to
address such risk of loss is based on transferring and pooling the risk of loss from a plurality of risk
exposed entities to a dedicated pooling entity. In essence, this can be executed by effectively
allocating the risk of loss to this pooling unit or entity by pooling resources of associated units,
which are exposed to a certain risk. In case, that one of the units is hit by an event occurrencing
related to a transferred risk, the pooling entity directly intercepts the loss or damage caused by
the event by transferring resources from the pooled resources to the affected unit. Pooling of
resources can be achieved by exchanging predefined amounts of resources with the resource
pooling system; e.g. payments or premiums to be paid, for the transfer of the risk. This means
that predefined amounts of resources are exchanged for the other unit assuming the risk of loss.
              For living individuals, a special kind of risk is based on the risk of loss of life and
related possible losses; i.e., losses that occur as a consequence of the death of that individual.
Such risks are traditionally handled by so-called life insurance systems. To administer a loss for
benefits provided by a life insurance policy, a substantial amount of information must be
collected and managed by the pooling entity in order to allow risk-transfer. Appropriate
documentation must be identified, captured and analyzed, such

                                                2
   as death certificates or medical provider verification of condition or service in the cases
   of health/supplementary health. One important problem arises by the fact that life
   insurance methods are triggered by the death of the unit, which risk is transferred.
   However, often problems arise for an individual before then, in that financial resources
 5 were threatened by losses occurring prior to death as a consequence of the events
   leading to death. This is mostly the case when the individual suffers from potentially
   terminal disease, like malignant cancer, which may inevitably lead to the death of the
   individual. Typically, the patient is confronted with increasing costs for medical
   treatment or other related costs as travel expenses or additional heating costs, but also
10 by the decreasing ability to earn the money needed to fulfill their monthly financial
   needs. This may lead to the necessity of having to make many sacrifices; e.g. taking
   children out of private schools, selling their house and filling for bankruptcy. All these
   financial concerns contrariwise impacted on their health. Recovery is delayed, and
   stress additionally aggravates the anyway poor health.
15 As a solution, resource-pooling systems were developed that cover such "critical
   illnesses", where the resource-pooling unit operated by the insurer provides a lump sum
   cash payment if the risk-exposed unit, which is, seen from the prespective of the insurer
   the policyholder, is diagnosed with one of the critical illnesses listed in a defined table of
   transferred risk. The operation of the resource-pooling system may also be structured to
20 pay out regular income, and the payouts may also benefit the policyholder undergoing
   a surgical procedure, for example, having a heart bypass operation. Typically, such
   systems require the risk-exposed unit to survive a minimum number of days (the so
   called survival period) from when the illness was first diagnosed. The survival period can
   vary; however, 14 days isthe most commonly used survival period used. In the
25 Australian market, survival periods are set between 8 - 14 days. However, systems as
   e.g. systems accosiated with indemnity based on accelerated payment (e.g. related
   to specific life insurance products) and stand alone products, are also known. The
   terms, as defined for the risk transfer, typically contain specific predefined triggers or
   rules to be applied that provide the basis for the determination of when a diagnosis of
30 a critical illness is considered valid. Terms for survival periods may also define
   parameters providing that the diagnosis need to be made by a physician who
   specializes in the treatment of that illness or condition or name specific tests, e.g. ECG
   changes in case of a myocardial infarctions, that confirm the diagnosis. In many
   markets, the trigger parameters for many of the diseases and conditions have become

                                                  3
   standardized; thus typically resource-pooling systems would use the same definition (cf.
   stand alone products and accelerated critical illness systems). The standardization of
   the critical illness definitions serves many purposes, including better clarity of coverage
   for the risk-exposed units and greater comparability of terms and conditions for risk
 5 transfers among different resource-pooling systems. Such terms and conditions are
   often defined in the policy covering the risk transfer. For example, in the UK the
   Association of British Insurers (ABI) has issued a Statement of Best Practice, which
   includes a number of standard definitions for common critical illnesses. The prior art also
   provides for alternative methods of critical illness risk transfer, other than the lump sum
10 cash payment method. These critical illness insurance systems can directly pay health
   providers (as e.g. "tiers payant" systems) for the treatment costs involving critical and
   life-threatening illnesses that are covered by the policyholder's insurance policy,
   including fees for specialists and procedures at a select group of high-ranking hospitals
   up to a certain amount per course of treatment as set out in the policy, but also transfer
15 the payment to the customer.
   In the prior art, critical illnesses are typicallycovered by critical illness risk transfer; these
   are heart attack, cancer, stroke and coronary artery by-pass surgery. Examples of other
   conditions that might be covered include: Alzheimer's disease, blindness, deafness,
   kidney failure, major organ transplant, multiple sclerosis, HIV/AIDS contracted by blood
20 transfusion or during an operation, Parkinson's disease, paralysis of limb, terminal illness.
   One of the problems of the risk transfer system as provided by the prior art lies in the
   fact that the incidence of a condition may vary (i.e. in- or decrease) over time, and
   that diagnosis and treatment may improve over time, that the financial need to cover
   some illnesses deemed critical a decade ago isno longer considered necessary today.
25 Likewise, some of the conditions covered today may no longer need to be covered a
   decade or so from now. It is very difficult to adapt the prior art systems to such
   changing conditions. What is clear is the fact that the financial hardship at the time of
   diagnosis and afterwards increases during the course of treatment, which seldom can
   be meet by the present systems. Furthermore, operating the systems of the prior art
30 requires a high level of human resources, because these systems cannot be
   adequately automated. Therefore, a large quantity of the pooled resources are used
   by the resource-pooling system itself to administer the risk transfer, which makes the risk
   transfer expensive for the risk-exposed unit. Finally, another problem comes from the
   fact that, due to the medical progress, many patients no longer die but can survive for

                                                      4
 many years after undergoing treatment for a heart attack, stroke and cancer. Due to the long
survival period, such individuals, who were struck already once by a critical illness, continue to
 be exposed to the risk of a second or consequential occurrence of a critical illness. In fact, the
risk typically does not decrease, since the health of these patients is already weakened by the
first incidence of a critical illness. Since critical illnesses are traditionally meant to lead to death,
the risk involving such individuals, who may be affected by a second or even more critical illness
is no longer covered by the resource-pooling system. Therefore, although the patient survived
 his first bout with a critical illness, he may, at least financially, not survive the second time.
                In the state of the art, US 8 452 620 BI discloses a system for determining a
 parametric index value of the risk arising from aggregate litigation activity, which risk is
correlated with the financial exposures of the insureds' exposed to such claims, and of the
insurers who provide coverage. The parametric index determined from a set of parameters that
define the type, scope, timing of litigation activity for the index, as well as details how the index
values are determined from the underlying litigation exposure. Further, US 2002194099 Al
discloses a for managing a proxy asset vehicle and the means to implement the proxy assets by
defining the proxy assets set, distributing, managing, and maintaining a plurality of proxy assets
shares, linked to account activity in accordance with pre-determined criteria.
               Summary of the Invention
                It is an object of the present invention to substantially overcome or at least
ameliorate one or more disadvantages of existing arrangements.
                The disclosed arrangements typically provide a system and method for risk sharing
of critical illness risks of a variable number of risk exposure components by providing a dynamic
self-sufficient risk protection for the risk exposure components by means of the critical illness
insurance system. The critical illness insurance system, realized as a automated resource-pooling
system shall be completely automated and self-adaptable/self-maintaining by its technical
 means and shall provide the technical risk transfer basis, which can be used by service providers
in the risk transfer or insurance technology for risk transfer related to critical illness risks (CI). A
further advantage of the invention provides for a way to technically capture, handle and
automate complex related operations of the insurance industry related to critical illness risk
transfer. Another advantage is to synchronize and adjust such operations based on technical
 means. In contrast to the standard approach, the resource-pooling system shall create a
reproducible operation with the desired, technically based, repetitious accuracy based on
technical means, process flow and process control/operation.

                                                    5
            According to the disclosed arrangements, the above-mentioned advantages are
achieved particularly through the features of the independent claims. In addition, further
advantageous embodiments follow from the dependent claims and the related description.
            According to the disclosed arraignments, the above-mentioned advantages for risk
sharing of critical illness risks of a variable number of risk exposure components are

                                                6
   achieved, particularly, by providing a dynamic self-sufficient risk protection for the risk
   exposure components by means of the resource-pooling system, wherein the risk
   exposure components are connected to the resource-pooling system by means of a
   plurality of payment-receiving modules configured to receive and store payments from
 5 the risk exposure components for the pooling of their risks and resources, and wherein
   the resource-pooling system comprises an event-driven core engine comprising critical
   illness triggers triggering in a patient dataflow pathway to provide risk protection for a
   specific risk exposure component based on received and stored payments from the
   risk exposure components, in that the total risk of the pooled risk exposure components
10 comprises a critical illness risk contribution of each pooled risk exposure components
   associated to risk exposure in relation to a diagnosis of a critical illness, wherein the
   critical illness iscomprised in a predefined searchable table of critical illnesses and
   wherein critical illness losses occur as a consequence to the first diagnosis of risk
   exposure components with one of the searchable critical illnesses, in that in case of a
15 triggering of an occurrence of a critical illness in the patient data flow pathway of a risk
   exposure component, a corresponding trigger-flag is set by means of the resource
   pooling system and a parametric draw-down transfer of payments is assigned to this
   corresponding trigger-flag, wherein a loss associated with the critical illness is distinctly
   covered by the resource pooling system based on the respective trigger-flag and
20 based on the received and stored payment parameters from risk exposure
   components by the parametric draw-down transfer from the resource-pooling system
   to the risk exposure component and in that a first parametric payment istransferred by
   triggering the occurrence of the critical illness, a second parametric payment is
   transferred by a triggering of an acute treatment phase, and a third parametric
25 payment istransferred by a triggering of a recovery phase linked to terminal prognosis
   data. The critical illness triggers can for example comprise a trigger for triggering the
   occurrence of measuring parameters indicating heart attack and/or cancer and/or
   stroke and/or coronary artery by-pass surgery in the patient data flow pathway. Further,
   the critical illness triggers can e.g. comprise a trigger for triggering the occurrence of
30 measuring parameters indicating Alzheimer's disease, blindness, deafness, kidney
   failure, major organ transplant, multiple sclerosis, HIV/AIDS contracted by blood
   transfusion or during an operation, Parkinson's disease, paralysis of limb, terminal illness
   on the patient dataflow pathway. As an embodiment variant, it can be provided that
   the first parametric payment, for example can technically be implemented in that it
35 only is transferred by the triggering of the occurrence of measuring parameters

                                                 7
   indicating the critical illness of malignant cancer and/or a smaller incidence for ductal
   carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and/or early prostate carcinoma. Further, the acute treatment
   phase parameters indicating surgery and/or chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy
   and/or reconstructive surgery can be triggered on the patient data flow pathway by
 5 means of a critical illness trigger by the core engine. As an embodiment variant, it is
   provided that the second parametric payment only is transferred due to the triggering
   of acute treatment phase parameters indicating surgery and/or chemotherapy and/or
   radiotherapy and/or reconstructive surgery. The recovery phase parameters associated
   with terminal prognosis data can e.g. be triggered in a patient data flow pathway by
10 means of a critical illness trigger of the core engine. As a further embodiment variant,
   the third parametric payment is only transferred by the triggering of the recovery phase
   parameters and/or terminal prognosis parameters. As a further variant, the critical illness
   data of the patient dataflow pathway of the risk exposure component can e.g.
   additionally be transferred to an automated employee assistance system (EAP:
15 Employee Assistance Program) providing automated support to the risk exposure
   component. Alternatively or in addition, the critical illness data of the patient dataflow
   pathway of the risk exposure component can e.g. be transferred to an alert system of
   an Change Advisory Board (CAB) to activate automated or at least semi-automated,
   CAB actions. It can also be advantageously that the patient dataflow pathway is e.g.
20 monitored by the resource-pooling system by capturing patient-measuring parameters
   of the patient data flow pathway at least periodically and/or within predefined time
   frames or periods. Finally, the patient data flow pathway can e.g. be dynamically
   monitored by the resource-pooling system in that it triggers patient-measuring
   parameters of the patient dataflow pathway transmitted from associated measuring
25 systems. The invention has, inter alia, the advantage that the system provides the
   technical means to meet customer needs related to the financial hardships at the time
   of the diagnosis of a critical illness, which will become more acute as the treatment
   progresses. Therefore, cancer fears and the related consequences that are suffered by
   many people can be met with the automated resource-pooling system according to
30 the invention. The system has, furthermore, the advantage that smaller payments than
   in traditional critical illness systems are sufficient to allow for a safe operation of the
   system. The operational aspects of the system are transparent for operators as well as
   covered risk units, since payment is transferred in response to certain triggers on the
   cancer patient's information pathways. The system is able to provide an adaptable
35 survival period e.g. 14, 21 or 28 days, to be confirmed or defined by the risk transfer. The

                                                 8
   system is further able to provide the technical implementation of an automated system
   that is based on a drawdown payment operation or a predefined payment operation.
   The system also provides the technical means, which can support different underwriting
   options, such as (i) underwritten with a set of questions, (ii) in/out underwriting, (iii)
 5 inclusion or exclusion of Pre-Existing Condition Exclusion (PECE) and/or a Related
   Conditions Exclusion with the associated problems of risk transfer. PECE-problems are
   based on the fact that resource-pooling systems are often required by an employer to
   create safety provisions, if there is a diagnosis of a critical illness in an employee, in
   order to provide a lump sum benefit for an employee (or the employee's spouse or
10 children, if comprised in the risk transfer), who is diagnosed with one of the defined
   medical conditions or undergoes one of the listed surgical procedures. However, many
   systems fail to take over risk transfers if the individual suffered from the insured
   condition, before the risk transfer was activated (this is known as the Pre-Existing
   Condition Exclusion), or because the individual suffered from a condition that led to a
15 claim under the insured illness - for example, it was known that an individual suffered
   from high blood pressure before the risk transfer being activated, and suffered a stroke
   after the risk transfer had been activated. Another advantage of the system is based
   on the fact that payments are directly transferred to the risk transfer unit or the
   consumer/client. Therefore, the system is able to enhance critical illness insurance
20 offerings by independent financial advisers (IFA). IFAs are persons who give impartial
   advice to clients on financial matters and who are not employed by any financial
   institution, although commissions for the sale of products may be received. Especially
   the IFA service is made completely cost-transparent to the consumer. However, it is also
   clear to a man skilled in the art, that the system can comprise additional trigger levels,
25 i.e. more that the three herein exemplarily disclosed trigger levels.
                  In an embodiment variant, the above-mentioned advantages for risk sharing of
   critical illness risks of a variable number of risk exposure components are achieved,
   particularly, by providing a dynamic self-sufficient risk protection for the risk exposure
   components by means of the critical illness insurance system based on a resource
30 pooling system, in that risk-related component data are processed by an assembly
   module of the resource-pooling system and the likelihood of said risk exposure is
   provided by means of the assembly module for one or a plurality of the pooled risk
   exposure components based on the risk-related component data, wherein the risk
   exposure components are connected to the resource-pooling system by means of a

                                                   9
   plurality of payment receiving modules, and payment data are received and stored by
   means of a payment data store from the risk exposure components for the pooling of
   their risks, and wherein the resource-pooling system triggers a patient dataflow pathway
   by means of critical illness triggers of an event-driven core engine in order to provide risk
 5 protection for a specific risk exposure component based on received and stored
   payments from the risk exposure components, in that a first risk contribution of each
   pooled risk exposure components related to a first diagnosis of a critical illness is
   associated with risk exposure of each pooled risk exposure component, and the total
   risk of the pooled risk exposure components is determined by means of the resource
10 pooling system, wherein the critical illness is comprised in a predefined searchable table
   of critical illnesses, and wherein critical illness losses occur as a consequence of the first
   diagnosis of risk exposure components due to any one of the searchable critical
   illnesses, in that a first risk contribution of each of the pooled risk exposure components
   related to a second and/or successional risk contribution diagnosis of a critical illness is
15 associated with risk exposure of each pooled risk exposure component, and the total
   risk of the pooled risk exposure components is determined by means of the resource
   pooling system, wherein the critical illness is comprised in the predefined searchable
   table of critical illnesses, and wherein critical illness losses occur as a consequence of
   the second and/or successional diagnosis of risk exposure components due to any one
20 of the searchable critical illnesses, in that, in case an occurrence of a first or second or
   successional critical illness on the patient data flow pathway of a risk exposure
   component istriggered, a corresponding trigger-flag isset by means of the resource
   pooling system and a parametric draw-down transfer of payments is assigned to this
   corresponding trigger-flag, wherein a loss associated with the first or second or
25 successional critical illness isdistinctly covered by the resource-pooling system based on
   the respective trigger-flag and based on the received and stored payment parameters
   from risk exposure components by the parametric draw-down transfer from the
   resource-pooling system to the risk exposure component, and in that a first parametric
   payment is transferred by the triggering of the occurrence of the critical illness, a
30 second parametric payment is transferred by the triggering of an acute treatment
   phase, and a third parametric payment is transferred by the triggering ofan recovery
   phase associated with terminal prognosis data. This embodiment variant has the
   additional advantage, that it provides further the capability of triggering multiple
   occerence of critical illnesses and of trasfering can covering such risk by the system.

                                                10
                 In one embodiment variant, the receiving and preconditioned storage of
   payments from risk exposure components for the pooling of their risks is dynamically
   determined based on total risk and/or the likelihood of the risk exposure of the pooled
   risk exposure components. This embodiment variant has, inter alia, the advantage that
 5 the operation of the resource-pooling system can be dynamically adapted to
   changing conditions of the pooled risk, as, for example, changing demographic
   conditions or changing age distributions or the like of the pooled risk components. A
   further advantage is that the system needs no manual adaption, when it is operated in
   different environments, places or countries, because the size of the payments of the risk
10 exposure components is directly related to the totally pooled risk.
                 In another embodiment variant, the number of pooled risk exposure
   components is dynamically adapted, by means of the resource-pooling system, to a
   range where non-covariant occurring risks covered by the resource-pooling system
   affect only a relatively small proportion of the total pooled risk exposure components at
15 a given time. This variant has, inter alia, the advantage that the operational and
   financial stability of the system can be improved.
                 In a further embodiment variant, the critical illness triggers are dynamically
   adapted by means of an operating module based on time-correlated incidence data
   for a critical illness condition and/or diagnosis or treatment conditions indicating
20 improvements in diagnosis or treatment. This variant has, inter alia, the advantage that
   improvements in diagnosis or treatment can be dynamically captured by the system
   and dynamically affect the overall operation of the system based on the total risk of
   the pooled risk exposure components.
                 In yet another embodiment variant, the first, second and third parametric
25 payment are leveled by a predefined total payment sum determined at least based on
   the risk-related component data and/or on the likelihood of the risk exposure for one or
   a plurality of the pooled risk exposure components based on the risk-related
   component data, and wherein the first parametric payment that is transferred is up to
   30% of said total payment sum, and the second parametric payment that is transferred
30 is up to 50% of said total payment sum, and the third parametric payment that is
   transferred is up to the left over part given by said total payment sum, minus the actual
   first parametric payment and the second parametric payment. The predefined total

                                                11
   payments can e.g. be leveled to any appropriate lump sum, such as, for example,
   $50,000 up to $500,000, or any other sum related to the total transferred risk and the
   amount of the periodic payments of the risk exposure component. As embodiment
   variant of the realization of the system, the critical illness trigger e.g. can comprise multi
 5 dimensional trigger channels, wherein each of said trigger-flags is assigned to a first
   dimension trigger channel, comprising a first trigger-level triggering occurrence
   parameters of the critical illness, a second trigger-level triggering acute treatment
   phase parameters, and a third trigger-level triggering recovery phase parameters
   associated with terminal prognosis data, and each of said trigger-flags isassigned to at
10 least a second or higher dimension trigger channel, and comprises additional trigger
   stages based on the first, second and/or third trigger-level of the first dimension trigger
   channel. As a further variant, the critical illness trigger can also comprise multi
   dimensional trigger channels, wherein each of said trigger-flags is assigned to a first
   dimension of a trigger channels comprising a first trigger-level relative to triggering
15 occurrence parameters of the critical illness, a second trigger-level relative to triggering
   acute treatment phase parameters, and a third trigger-level relative to triggering
   recovery phase parameters associated with terminal prognosis data, and each of said
   trigger-flags is assigned to a second dimension of trigger channels comprising a first
   trigger-level triggering on a first stage of progression-measuring parameters of the
20 occurred critical illness, and one or more higher trigger-levels triggering on higher
   stages of progression-measuring parameters of the occurred critical illness. This variant,
   inter alia, has the advantage that the draw-down payments or the payments of
   predefined amounts, which depend on the first, second or third trigger level, i.e. the
   different stages of triggers, allow for an adapted payment of the total sum that is
25 dependent on the stage of the critical illness, as triggered by the system.
                 In one embodiment variant, a periodic payment transfer from the risk
   exposure components to the resource pooling system via a plurality of payment
   receiving modules is requested by means of a monitoring module of the resource
   pooling system, wherein the risk transfer or protection for the risk exposure components
30 is interrupted by the monitoring module when the periodic transfer is no longer
   detectable by means of the monitoring module. As a variant, the request for periodic
   payment transfer can be interrupted automatically or waived by means of the
   monitoring module, when the occurrence of indicators for critical illness is triggered in

                                                      12
variants have, inter alia, the advantage that the system allows for a further automation of the
monitoring operation, especially of its operation with regard to the pooled resources.
                In a further embodiment variant, an independent verification critical illness trigger of
the resource pooling system is activated in cases of a triggering of the occurrence of indicators
for critical illness in the patient data flow pathway of a risk exposure component by means of
the critical illness trigger and wherein the independent verification critical illness trigger
additionally is triggering for the occurrence of indicators regarding critical illness in an
alternative patient data flow pathway with independent measuring parameters from the
primary patient data flow pathway in order to verify the occurrence of the critical illness at the
risk exposure component. As a variant, the parametric draw-down transfer of payments is only
assigned to the corresponding trigger-flag, if the occurrence of the critical illness at the risk
exposure component is verified by the independent verification critical illness trigger. These
embodiment variants have, inter alia, the advantage that the operational and financial stability
of the system can thus be improved. In addition, the system is rendered less vulnerably relative
to fraud and counterfeit.

                 Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiments
                  Figure 1 illustrates, schematically, an architecture for a possible
10 implementation of an embodiment of the parametric, event-driven resource-pooling
   system 1 for risk sharing of critical illness risks. In Figure 1, reference numeral 1 refers to
   the resource-pooling system for risk sharing of the risk exposure components 21, 22, 23...
   The resource-pooling system 1 provides a dynamic self-sufficient risk protection and
   corresponding risk protection structure for a variable number of risk exposure
15 components 21, 22, 23, i.e.; persons or individuals, by its means. The system 1 includes at
   least one processor and associated memory modules. The system 1 can also include
   one or more display units and operating elements, such as a keyboard, and/or
   graphical pointing devices as a computer mouse. The resource-pooling system 1 is a
   technical device comprising electronic means that can be used by service providers in
20 the field of risk transfer or insurance technology for risk transfer related to critical illness
   risks (CI). The invention seeks to technically capture, handle and automate complex
   related operations of the insurance industry. An other aspect isto synchronize and
   adjust such operations based on technical means. In contrast to the standard
   approach, the resource-pooling system also achieves an reproducible operations with
25 the desired technical, repetitious accuracy because it iscompletely based on
   technical means, process flow and process control/operation.
                 The resource-pooling system 1 comprises an assembly module 5 to process
   risk related component data 211, 221, 231 and to provide the likelihood 212, 222, 232 of
   said risk exposure for one or a plurality of the pooled risk exposure components 21, 22,
30 23, etc. based on the risk-related component data 211, 221, 231.The resource-pooling
   system 1 can be implemented as a technical platform, which is developed and

                                              21
   implemented to provide critical illness risk transfer through a plurality of (but at least
   one) payment receiving module 4. The risk exposure components 21, 22, 23, etc. are
   connected to the resource-pooling system 1 by means of the plurality of payment
   receiving modules 4 configured to receive and store payments 214, 224, 234 from the
 5 risk exposure components 21, 22, 23,.... for the pooling of their risks in a payment data
   store 6. The storage of the payments can be implemented by transferring and storing
   component-specific payment parameters. The payment amount can be dynamically
   determined by means of the resource-pooling system 1 based on total risk of the overall
   pooled risk exposure components 21, 22, 23. For the pooling of the resources, the
10 resource-pooling system 1 can comprise a monitoring module 8 requesting a periodic
   payment transfer from the risk exposure components 21, 22, 23, etc. to the resource
   pooling system 1 by means of the plurality of payment receiving modules 2, wherein the
   risk protection for the risk exposure components 21, 22, 23,.... is interrupted by the
   monitoring module 8, when the periodic transfer is no longer detectable by means of
15 the monitoring module 8. In one embodiment variant, the request for periodic payment
   transfers is automatically interrupted or waived by means of the monitoring module 8, if
   the occurrence 1001 of indicators for critical illness 71, 72, 73 is triggered 31 in the
   patient data flow pathway of a risk exposure component 21, 22, 23,...
                 As also illustrated schematically in Figure 1, the resource-pooling system 1
20 includes a data storing module for capturing the risk-related component data and
   multiple functional modules; e.g., namely the payment receiving modules 4, the core
   engine 3 with the triggers 31, 32, 33, the assembly module 5 or the operating module 30.
   The functional modules can be implemented at least partly as programmed software
   modules stored on a computer readable medium, connected as fixed or removable to
25 the processor(s) of system 1 or to associated automated systems. One skilled in the art
   understands, however, that the functional modules can also be implemented fully by
   means of hardware components, units and/or appropriately implemented modules. As
   illustrated in Figure 1, system 1 can be connected via a network, such as a
   telecommunications network, to the payment receiving module 4. The network can
30 include a wired or wireless network; e.g., the Internet, a GSM network (Global System for
   Mobile Communication), an UMTS network (Universal Mobile Telecommunications
   System) and/or a WLAN (Wireless Local Region Network), and/or dedicated point-to
   point communication lines. In any case, the technical electronic money schemes for
   the present system comprises adequate technical, organizational and procedural

                                                22
   safeguard means in order to prevent, contain and detect threats to the security of the
   scheme, particularly the threat of counterfeits. The resource-pooling system 1 comprises
   further all necessary technical means for electronic money transfer and association e.g.
   initiated by one or more associated payment receiving modules 4 over an electronic
 5 network. The monetary parameters can be based on all possible electronic and
   transferable means as e.g. e-currency, e-money, electronic cash, electronic currency,
   digital money, digital cash, digital currency, or cyber currency etc., which can only be
   exchanged electronically. The payment data store 6 provides the means for
   associating and storing monetary parameters associated with a single of the pooled risk
10 exposure components 21, 22, 23. The present invention can involve the use of the
   mentioned network, such as e.g. computer networks or telecommunication networks,
   and/or the internet and digital stored value systems. Electronic funds transfer (EFT),
   direct deposit, digital gold currency and virtual currency are further examples of
   electronic money. Also, the transfer can involve technologies, such as financial
15 cryptography and technologies enabling the same. For the transaction of the
   monetary parameters, it is preferable that hard electronic currency is used without the
   technical possibilities for disputing or reversing any charges. The resource-pooling
   system 1 supports, for example, non-reversible transactions. The advantage of this
   arrangement is that the operating costs of the electronic currency system are greatly
20 reduced by not having to resolve payment disputes. However, this way, it is also
   possible for electronic currency transactions to clear instantly, making the funds
   available immediately to the system 1.This means that using hard electronic currency is
   more akin to a cash transaction. However, also conceivable is the use of soft electronic
   currency, such as currency that allows for the reversal of payments, for example having
25 a "clearing time" of 72 hours, or the like. The way of the electronic monetary parameter
   exchange applies to all connected systems and modules related to the resource
   pooling system 1 of the present invention, such as e.g. the payment receiving module
   4. The monetary parameter transfer to the resource-pooling system 1 can be initiated
   by a payment-receiving module 4 or on request of the resource-pooling system 1.
30               The resource-pooling system 1 comprises an event-driven core engine 3
   comprising critical illness triggers 31, 32, 33 for triggering component-specific measuring
   parameters in the patient data flow pathway 213, 223, 233 of the assigned risk exposure
   components 21, 22, 23, .... The patient data flow pathway 213, 223, 233 can e.g. be
   monitored by the resource-pooling system 1, capturing patient-related measuring

                                                23
   parameters of the patient data flow pathway 213, 223, 233 at least periodically and/or
   within predefined time periods. The patient data flow pathway 213, 223, 233 can, for
   example, also be dynamically monitored by the resource-pooling system 1, by
   triggering patient-measuring parameters of the patient data flow pathway 213, 223,
 5 233 transmitted from associated measuring systems. Triggering the patient data flow
   pathway 213, 223, 233, which comprises dynamically recorded measuring parameters
   of the concerned risk exposure components 21, 22, 23, .          the system 1 is able to
   detect the occurrence of a critical illness and dynamically monitor the different stages
   during the progress of the critical illness in order to provide appropriately adapted and
10 gradated risk protection for a specific risk exposure component 21, 22, 23, .... Such a risk
   protection structure is based on received and stored payments 214, 224, 234 from the
   related risk exposure component 21, 22, 23, .... and/or related to the total risk of the
   resource-pooling system ,1 based on the overall transferred critical illness risks of all
   pooled risk exposure components 21, 22, 23, ....
15                Figure 2 shows a block diagram with possible trigger stages, wherein
   reference number 1001 is assigned to the triggering of the critical illness, for example
   cancer; reference number 1002 designates the triggering of the treatment phase, such
   as, for example, surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy or the administration of
   medication, etc.; reference number 1003 designates the triggering of the recovery
20 phase or the triggering of the terminal illness and/or the aftercare phase.; and
   reference number 1004 designates the triggering of additional support services.
   Reference number 1004 gives an example of additional trigger stages to the critical
   illness triggers 31, 32, 33 of the core engine module 3. The critical illness triggers 31, 32, 33
   can e.g. comprise a trigger 31 for triggering the occurrence 1001 of the measuring
25 parameters, indicating a heart attack and/or cancer and/or a stroke and/or coronary
   artery by-pass surgery in the patient data flow pathway 213, 223, 233. Further, the
   critical illness triggers 31, 32, 33 can comprise a trigger 31 for triggering the occurrence
    1001 of measuring parameters indicating Alzheimer's disease, blindness, deafness,
   kidney failure, major organ transplant, multiple sclerosis, HIV/AIDS contracted by blood
30 transfusion or during an operation, Parkinson's disease, paralysis of limb, terminal illness
   in the patient data flow pathway 213, 223, 233. The majority of cases of occurrences of
   critical illness are typically related to heart attack, stroke and cancer, as can be
   expected. The average age of individual 21, 22, 23, at which a critical illness can be
   detected in the patient data flow pathway 213, 223, 233, is  41 years; however, this

                                                 24
   depends on the development of diagnostic and other medical means. These statistics
   are common for all countries where statistics are maintained. However, it is of great
   concern to observe the increasing number of critical illness occurrences - particularly
   regarding cancer cases. In most countries, this observed increase is more than 50%, and
 5 in some even 80%. Earlier diagnosis due to better diagnostic equipment may be
   partially responsible for these figuress. Therefore, to ensure proper operation of the
   resource-pooling system 1, the definitions of the stored trigger parameters 71, 72, 73 of
   critical illness in the trigger table 7 can be dynamically adapted based on a monitoring
   of changing risks in the risk exposure components 21, 22, 23. In particular, the trigger
10 parameters 71, 72, 73 can be region-specific, country-specific and/or specific of the
   total pooled risk, adapted or changed. New critical illnesses 71, 72, 73 can be added,
   while others can be deleted from the triggerable list of critical illnesses by the resource
   pooling system, owing to better treatments or other changed environmental conditions.
   In one embodied variant, the critical illness triggers 31, 32, 33 can be dynamically
15 adapted by means of an operating module 30, based on time-correlated incidence
   dates of a critical illness condition and/or diagnosis or treatment conditions indicating
   improvements in diagnosis or treatment.
                  In addition to the adaptation of the triggers 31, 32, 33, the amount of
   requested payments from the risk exposure components 21, 22, 23 can be accordingly
20 adjusted by the resource-pooling system 1.Therefore the receiving and preconditioned
   storage 6 of payments 214, 224, 234 from risk exposure components 21, 22, 23, ... for the
   pooling of their risks can be determined dynamically, based on total risk 50 and/or the
   likelihood of the risk exposure of the pooled risk exposure components 21, 22, 23, ... To
   improve operational and functional security of the resource- pooling system 1 even
25 further, the number of pooled risk exposure components 21, 22, 23, ... can be
   dynamically adapted by means of the resource-pooling system 1 to a range where
   non-covariant, occurring risks covered by the resource-pooling system 1 affect only a
   relatively small proportion of the totally pooled risk exposure components 21, 22, 23,
   at a given time.
30                The total risk 50 of the pooled risk exposure components 21, 22, 23,
   comprises a first risk contribution 511, 521, 531 of each pooled risk exposure component
   21, 22, 23, ... that is associated with risk exposure in relation to a first diagnosis of a
   critical illness. The triggering parameters 71, 72, 73 of the covered critical illnesses is

                                                  25
   comprised and stored in a predefined searchable table 7, such as e.g. an
   appropriately structured hash table, of critical illnesses 71, 72, 73, respectively critical
   illness parameters 71, 72, 73. The critical illness losses occur as a consequence to the first
   diagnosis of risk exposure components 21, 22, 23, ... with regard to one of the
 5 searchable critical illnesses; i.e., the possible need of a risk exposure components 21, 22,
   23, ... to be covered by the pooled resources of the resource-pooling system 1 is linked
   to the risk of the occurrence of a critical illness requiring complex medical treatment
   and handling.
                  The total risk 50 of the pooled risk exposure components 21, 22, 23,...
10 comprises at least a second risk contribution 512,522,523 and/or third or additional
   successional risk contributions 513/521/...51i/52i/53i; i.e., up to the i-th risk contribution,
   associated with risk exposure in relation to a second and/or successional critical
   illness(es). The critical illnesses 71, 72, 73 for triggering the second risk contribution 512,
   522, 523 and/or third or additional successional risk contributions 513/521/.. .51 i/52i/53i
15 are the same as for the first risk contribution and comprised in the predefined
   searchable table 7 of critical illness parameters 71, 72, 73.
                  Figure 4 shows a block diagram with an exemplary parameterization of the
   risk exposure for critical illness of the risk exposure components 21, 22, 23. The reference
   numeral 520 gives the total transferred risk of a specific risk exposure component 21, 22,
20 23 comprising at least a first risk contribution 511, 521, 531 for a first occurrence of a
   critical illness. Further comprised is a second risk contribution 512, 522, 532 related to a
   second occurrence of a critical illness. Also comprised can be a third 513, 523, 533 and
   subsequent 51i,52i,53i risk contribution; i.e., "i" denotes the i-th risk distribution.
                  In case of triggering an occurrence of a first or second or successional
25 critical illness 71,72,73 on the patient dataflow pathway 213,223,233 of a risk exposure
   component 21, 22, 23, i.e. if a triggering of an occurrence of a first or second or
   successional critical illness 71, 72, 73 goes into effect in the patient data flow pathway
   213, 223, 233, a corresponding trigger-flag isset by means of the resource-pooling
   system 1 and a parametric draw-down or predefined transfer of payments is assigned
30 to this corresponding trigger-flag. A loss associated with the first or second or
   successional critical illness(es) 71, 72, 73 is distinctly covered by the resource-pooling
   system 1, based on the respective trigger-flag and based on the received and stored

                                               26
   payment parameters 214, 224, 234 from risk exposure components 21, 22, 23 by the
   parametric draw-down or predefined transfer from the resource-pooling system 1 to the
   risk exposure component 21, 22, 23,etc. The payment receiving module 4 can, as an
   input device, comprise one or more data processing units, displays and other operating
 5 elements, such as a keyboard and/or a computer mouse or another pointing device.
   As mentioned previously, the receiving operation of the payments with regard to the
   risk exposure components 21, 22, 23 is monitored based on the stored component
   specific payment parameters in the payment data store 6. The different components of
   the resource-pooling system 1, such as e.g. the payment receiving module 4 with the
10 core engine 3 and the assembly module 5 can be connected via a network for signal
   transmission. The network can comprise, e.g., a telecommunications network, such as a
   wired or wireless network, e.g., the internet, a GSM network (Global System for Mobile
   Communications), an UMTS network (Universal Mobile Telecommunications System)
   and/or a WLAN (Wireless Local Area Network), a Public Switched Telephone Network
15 (PSTN) and/or dedicated point-to-point communication lines. The payment receiving
   module 4 and/or core engine 3 and the assembly module 5 can also comprise a
   plurality of interfaces for connecting to the telecommunications network adhering to
   the transmission standard or protocol. As an embodied variant, the payment receiving
   module 4 can also be implemented as an external device relative to the resource
20 pooling system 1, which provides the risk transfer service via the network for signal
   transmission, e.g. by a secured data transmission line.
                 A first parametric payment 211 is transferred by triggering the occurrence
   1001 of the critical illness 71, 72, 73 by means of the critical illness trigger 31 of the core
   engine 3, thus triggering the measuring parameters of the specific risk exposure
25 component 21, 22, 23 in the related patient data flow pathway 213, 223, 233.The core
   engine 3, analogously to the resource-pooling system 1 and the other components of
   the system, is implemented based on underlying electronic components, steering
   codes and interacting interface devices, such as e.g. appropriate signal generation
   modules or other modules interacting electronically by means of appropriate signal
30 generation between the different modules, devices, or the like. For example, the first
   parametric payment can be transferred by triggering 31 the occurrence 1001 of
   measuring parameters indicating the critical illness 71, 72, 73 of malignant cancer
   and/or smaller incidence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and/or early prostate
   carcinoma.

                                                27
                 A second parametric payment 212 is transferred by triggering measuring
   parameters in the patient data flow pathway 213, 223, 233 indicating the initiation of an
   acute treatment phase 1002 by means of the critical illness trigger 32 of the core
   engine 3. For example, acute treatment phase parameters 1002 indicating surgery
 5 and/or chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy and/or reconstructive surgery can be
   triggered in patient data flow pathway 213, 223, 233 by means of a critical illness trigger
   32 of the core engine 3. For example, the second parametric payment can only be
   transferred by triggering 32 acute treatment phase parameters 1002, indicating surgery
   and/or chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy and/or reconstructive surgery. Finally a
10 third parametric payment 213 is transferred by triggering measuring parameters in the
   patient data flow pathway 213, 223, 233 indicating the initiation of a recovery phase
    1003 linked to terminal prognosis data by means of the critical illness trigger 33 by the
   core engine 3. For example, recovery phase parameters 1003 linked to or associated
   with terminal prognosis data are triggered in patient data flow pathway 213, 223, 233
15 by means of a critical illness trigger 33 by the core engine 3. As a variant, the third
   parametric payment is only transferrable by triggering 33 recovery phase parameters
   and/or terminal prognosis parameters 1003.
                 Therefore, if triggering 1001 takes effect, an occurrence of a first critical
   illness 71, 72, 73 in the patient daltaflow pathway 213, 223, 233 of a risk exposure
20 component 21, 22, 23, any associated loss is covered by the resource-pooling system 1
   based on the received and stored payments 214, 224, 234 from risk exposure
   components 21, 22, 23 by transferring a parametric diagnosis payment 2001 from the
   resource-pooling system 1 to the risk exposure component 21, 22, 23, etc.; if triggering
    1002 takes effect, an occurrence of an acute treatment phase in the patient data flow
25 pathway 213, 223, 233 of an associated loss is covered by the resource-pooling system
    1 based on the received and stored payments 214, 224, 234 from risk exposure
   components 21, 22, 23 by transferring a parametric treatment phase payment 2002
   from the resource-pooling system 1 to the risk exposure component 21, 22, 23, etc,; and
   if triggering 1003 takes effect, an occurrence of arecovery phase linked to terminal
30 prognosis data in the patient data flow pathway and associated loss iscovered by the
   resource-pooling system based on the received and stored payments 214, 224, 234
   from risk exposure components 21, 22, 23 by transferring a parametric recovery phase
   payment 2003 from the resource-pooling system 1 to the risk exposure component 21,
   22, 23, etc. The first, second and third parametric payments can, for example, be

                                                28
   leveled by a predefined total payment sum determined at least based on the risk
   related component data 211, 221, 231 and/or the likelihood of the risk exposure for one
   or a plurality of the pooled risk exposure components 21, 22, 23, etc., based on the risk
   related component data 211, 221, 231, wherein the first parametric payment is
 5 transferred up to 30% of said total payment sum, and the second parametric payment
   is transferred up to 50% of said total payment sum, and the third parametric payment is
   transferred up to the residual part given by said total payment sum minus the actual first
   parametric payment and the second parametric payment. Such an exemplary
   payment draw-down as it can be provided by the resource-pooling system 1 in the
10 event of a triggering of a critical illness at a risk exposure component is shown in the
   diagram of Figure 3.
                 As a further technical variant, the critical illness triggers 31, 32, 33 comprise
   multi-dimensional trigger channels. Each of said trigger-flags is assigned to a first
   dimension trigger channel comprising a first trigger-level triggering 31 on occurrence
15 parameter 1001 of the critical illness 71, 72, 73, a second trigger-level triggering 32 on
   acute treatment phase parameter 1002, and a third trigger-level triggering 33 on
   recovery phase parameter 1003 linked to or associated with terminal prognosis data:
   and each of said trigger-flags is assigned to at least a second or higher dimension
   trigger channel and comprises additional trigger-stages based on the first, second
20 and/or third trigger-levels of the first dimension trigger channel. The critical illness trigger
   31, 32, 33 can e.g. comprise multi-dimensional trigger channels, wherein each of said
   trigger-flags is assigned to a first dimension of a trigger channel comprising a first trigger
   level triggering 31 on occurrence parameter 1001 of the critical illness 71, 72, 73, a
   second trigger-level triggering 32 on acute treatment phase parameter 1002, and a
25 third trigger-level triggering 33 on recovery phase parameter 1003 linked to terminal
   prognosis data, and each of said trigger-flags is assigned to a second dimension of a
   trigger channel comprising a first trigger-level triggering 31 on a first stage of
   progression-measuring parameters of the occurrance 1001 with regard to critical illness
   71, 72, 73, and one or more higher trigger-levels triggering 32, 33,.... in higher stages of
30 progression-measuring parameters of the occurred critical illness 71, 72, 73.
                 In addition, the resource-pooling system 1 can be realized such that it
   transfers critical illness data in the patient data flow pathway 213, 223, 233 of the
   related risk exposure component 21, 22, 23, etc., after triggering the occurrence of a

                                                  29
   critical illness 71, 72, 73, to an automated employee assistance system (EAP: Employee
   Assistance Program) providing automated support to the risk exposure component 21,
   22, 23, etc. Analogously, by triggering the occurrence of a critical illness 71, 72, 73 by
   means of the critical illness trigger 31 by the core engine 3, critical illness data in the
 5 patient data flow pathway 213, 223, 233 of the related risk exposure component 21, 22,
   23, etc. can be transferred to an alert system of an Change Advisory Board (CAB) to
   activate automated or at least semi-automated CAB actions.
                  Finally, in a further specified embodied variant, an independent verification
   critical illness trigger of the resource-pooling system 1 can be activated in the event of
10 a triggering of the occurrence 1001 of indicators for critical illness 71, 72, 73 in the
   patient data flow pathway 213, 223, 233 of a risk exposure component 21, 22, 23, etc.
   by means of the critical illness trigger 31, and wherein the independent verification
   critical illness trigger additionally is triggering with regard tothe occurrence 1001
   indicators for critical illness 71, 72, 73 in an alternative patient data flow pathway 215,
15 225, 235 with independent measuring parameters from the primary patient data flow
   pathway 213, 223, 233 to verify the occurrence 1001 of the critical illness 71, 72, 73 at
   the risk exposure component 21, 22, 23, etc, As a variant, the parametric draw-down or
   predefined transfer of payments is only assigned to the corresponding trigger-flag, if the
   occurrence 1001 of the critical illness 71, 72, 73 at the risk exposure component 21, 22,
20 23, etc. is verified by the independent verification critical illness trigger.
