   herein in their entirety by reference,                                 which means        that
10 it    should be          read       and considered             by the     reader     as   part
   of     this       text.        That       the      document,        reference,         patent

15        Discussion            of     the     background          to   the     invention      is
   intended         to    facilitate            an   understanding          of    the    present
   invention           only.         It     should         be     appreciated         that    the
   discussion          is     not      an   acknowledgement            or    admission       that
   any of the material                   referred to was published, known or
20 part       of    the      common         general          knowledge       of    the    person
   skilled         in      the       art     in     any       jurisdiction         as    at   the
   priority date of the invention.
          The     liquefaction              of     natural        gas   is    normally       used
   for     making       the      transportation               and   storage      of    the   same
25 more convenient.
          The present disclosure                      relates in particular               to  the
   liquefaction             technology           of    natural       gas    known      with   the
   name of C3-MR, i.e. propane-mixed refrigerant.
                                                    -1-

         The C3-MR process            has     existed since           the   70ties'      and
   dominates        the relative market.
         Most       plants    for     the      liquefaction          of    natural       gas
   operate on the basis of this technology.
 5       Its     functioning       is    based        on  two      cooling    cycles:      a
   pre-cooling          cycle     with       a     pure      cooling      fluid,       i.e.
   propane        (C3)   and   a   liquefaction            and     sub-cooling      cycle
   with      a  mixture     of   cooling        fluids        (MR),    i.e.   a  mixture
   of nitrogen, methane, ethane, and propane.
10       The       propane      cycle       develops            on   three      or     four
   pressure levels          and has       the     function of pre-cooling                the
   natural      gas      to    temperatures             ranging      from     -300C       to
   -4 0 0C.
         This      cycle    has   the     additional            function     of   cooling
15 and        partially       liquefying             the        mixed     refrigerant,
   hereinafter MR, used in the second cycle.
         The    heat     exchangers       used      for    this     cycle    are   of    the
   tube-bundle          kettle       type,        in     which      the     propane       on
   evaporating         on the    shell      side cools           the hot fluid which
20 is flowing in the pipes.
         In    the MR cycle, on           the     contrary, the heat exchange
   between       the    coolant      and    natural        gas     takes    place     in   a
   spiral      exchanger called "main cryogenic heat exchanger"
   (MCHE) which           represents        the      core      of   the   liquefaction
25 process.
         The     compressors       of    the     cooling        cycles    are   operated
   by   large       gas   turbines       or,      less     frequently,        by   vapour
   turbines or electric motors.
                                              -2-

          In      particular,               optimizing            the        process           and
   configuration              of        the      machines         used        in      a      C3-MR
   liquefaction plant has played one of                             the most important
   roles     in   the      evolution          of   the   liquefaction            capacity       of
 5 a LNG     (Liquefied Natural Gas)                   train.
          As   operators          prefer       to   use    gas    turbines         similar      to
   each other         for optimizing maintenance processes,                                one of
   the    most     evolute         and     diffused       scheme       is    the     so-called
   Split-MRT ,        conceived           by   the   company        APCI      (Air     Products
10 &     Chemicals         Int.),         wherein      a      portion        of     the     power
   required       for      the      compression         of     the    mixed      refrigerant
   is      provided          by       the       same     turbine           used       for      the
   compression of propane.
          This    configuration              allows     full     use      of   the    power     of
15 gas      turbines         and       minimizes        the      number         of     turbines
   present in the cooling circuit.
          The    Split-MRT M          configuration            enables        a    production
   capacity       of     about        5   MTPA     per    year,      to     the     detriment,
   however, of the operative flexibility.
20        In    this       configuration,             in      fact,      the     compressors
   rotate       at     a      constant          rpm    and       lie      on     two       shafts
   entrained        by     respective          gas   turbines         of    the     heavy-duty
   type.
          These     shafts        are     supported      by auxiliary            motors       and,
25 together        with        the       turbines,       provide          the     C3     and    MR
   compressors with the                   necessary power, which is                    equal    to
   about 200 MW.
          As    the     various           stages     of      the    MR     compressor          are
                                                  -3-

   installed            on      the       shafts          of        the       two      turbines,             a
   malfunctioning               of      a     compressor             not       only       causes        the
   stoppage         of the       turbine          on which          the     damaged compressor
   is     installed,           but      also        the     other         turbine,         generating
 5 the     stoppage of the whole plant.
               The     Split-MRTM         configuration               therefore            allows       the
   exploitation              of      the       power         of      gas        turbines          to      be
   optimized,            to   the     detriment,             however,           of   the     operative
   flexibility of the circuit.
10        Furthermore,                this          existing             configuration                uses
   large-sized              turbines            which         are        more        difficult            to
   purchase            as    the       number          of       producers            is      extremely
   limited.
          The       lack     of     competition              on      the      market        of    large
15 sized        turbines        causes        an     increase          in     the    selling        price
   and prolonged delivery times.
          In        addition,               heavy-duty               gas         turbines             have
   thermodynamic             efficiency             characteristics                which      have      now
   been        outdated         by     new        types       of      gas       turbines         of     the
20 "aeroderivative"                   type          which           claim          specific           fuel
   consumptions at least 20%                         lower.
          It     is     against        this       background             that      embodiments            of
   the present disclosure have been developed.
            According           to    a     first        principal             aspect,       there        is
25 provided          a   cooling        circuit         for      a   liquefaction             plant       of

20     months of the year.
       With    reference        to   figure      1,   this     shows    a  cooling
   circuit 100 for a liquefaction plant of natural gas.
       In   particular,         said    liquefaction         plant    of   natural
   gas  is   schematized         in    its    two    main     sub-systems:      the
25 pre-cooling      system       105,    which      cools     the    natural    gas
   introduced into the plant to a temperature ranging from
   -30'C   to -40'C,       and the      liquefaction        system 106,      which
   liquefies     and       sub-cools        the     pre-cooled        gas    to   a
                                          -8-

   temperature ranging from -145'C to -160'C.
        The     natural      gas      is    first      pre-cooled        in   a  pre
   cooling      system       comprising         two      parallel        compression
   lines    of    propane,        each    having     a   first      compressor    102
 5 activated      by   a  first       gas   turbine      101'.      Said system    is
   also    configurated           to    pre-cool       the      mixed    refrigerant
   used in the liquefaction system 106.
        The    cooled      natural        gas   is     subsequently        liquefied
   and   sub-cooled      in     a   liquefaction        system of natural         gas
10 comprising       three parallel          lines     for      the  compression    of
   the   mixed     refrigerant,         each   having a          second   compressor
   103 activated by a second gas turbine 101".
        The     pre-cooling            system      105,        fed    by    the   two
   compression        lines      of    propane,       allows       the   cooling   of
15 natural     gas    to a temperature             ranging from           -300C    to
   -4 0 C.
        The     liquefaction           system     106,       fed     by   the   three
   compression        lines      of   the    mixed      refrigerant,        allows   a
   further       removal         of     heat     from        the     natural     gas,
20 transforming        said     natural      gas   into      liquid     natural   gas
    (LNG).
        Said first       gas turbines          101'     are preferably         of the
   medium-sized        aeroderivative           type,      for     example    with   a
   power ranging from 30 MW to 60 MW.
25      Said     second     gas     turbines     101"      are     preferably    also
   of   the   medium-sized           aeroderivative            type,    for   example
   with a power ranging from 30 MW to 60 MW.
        Said       compression           lines      of      propane       or    mixed
                                            -9-

   refrigerant            are     in     parallel          with       respect       to      each      other
   and      provide          an      autonomous             contribution              to       the       heat
   removal from the natural gas.
           In     particular,              each        of     said       lines        comprises              at
 5 least        one     compressor             102       or     103,      operated            by     a     gas
   turbine          101'      or      101",        for      compressing             a      refrigerant
   suitable         for expanding in the pre-cooling system 105 or
   in the liquefaction system 106.
           In     particular,               in       the      liquefaction                process            of
10 natural         gas     known       as    C3-MR,        the      power      absorbed            for     the
   compression             of    propane           is     equal        to   about         35% of           the
   total        power       required,            whereas         the      power       absorbed             for
   the      compression            of     the       mixed       refrigerant             is      equal        to
   about 65%          of the total power required.
15         Five         aeroderivative                   gas         turbines              101,          101"
   positioned           in    parallel           and the         same      as    each       other,         are
   used       for    providing            the      power        necessary          for      activating
   said      compressors             102     and      103,      of     which      two        (101')        are
   destined          for     activating              said     first        compressors              102      of
20 propane         and      three         (101")         for      activating             said        second
   compressors 103 of mixed refrigerant.
           This     configuration               of     the      compression            lines         allows
   the     first       two     gas      turbines          101'       to   make      two       fifths         of

   equal        to   about        35% of          the     total        power      required.              This
   relationship             between          the      power        required         by      said       first
   and      second        compressors               102,      103       and    the       total        power

   turbine       116      of     the     heavy-duty           type,      and    the    power
   necessary        for      activating         a    seventh        compressor       114    at

   turbine 117         of the heavy-duty type.
        Said     traditional            gas   turbines         116,     117  have    an   ISO
   nominal     power       of     86.2    MW    equal      to    a   power    supplied     at
10 250C     of      about        72     MW,      and      a     constant        number     of
   revolutions of the               shaft.
        In       particular,              according            to      said       Split-MR TM
   configuration,            said      compressor         112    of    propane     provides
   the  cooling power necessary for pre-cooling the natural
15 gas    in      said       pre-cooling            system         105,    whereas       said
   compressors          113,        114,    115,       arranged         in   series      with
   respect       to      each        other,      provide          the     cooling      power
   necessary        for      liquefying         and      sub-cooling         the    natural
   gas  in said liquefaction system 106.
20      Said       traditional            gas      turbines         116,     117    of    the
   heavy-duty          type,        are    of      the      single-shaft          type    and
   preferably         require         large-sized          auxiliary        motors      111',
   111"   for      the     start-up.         These       motors       are   necessary       in
   the  start-up         phase       for   activating          the    gas   turbines      and
25 bringing      them      to     a   rev   regime       which      allows     them    to  be
   self-sustained.
        Said     auxiliary           motors     111',       111"     are   also    used   for
   producing       additional           power     to    that     supplied by        the   gas

   cooling circuits.
           In    particular,             said     auxiliary          motors        111',       111"    are
   installed             on      respective               common       turbine            shafts       and
 5 compressors, and have a power of about 20 MW each.
           Viceversa,            according           to    the present           disclosure,           the
   compression                  lines         of          both       propane             and        mixed
   refrigerant,               are     in     parallel          in    order       to      prevent       the
   failure          of    a    gas   turbine           or   compressor          from       leading       to
10 the     stoppage of the whole liquefaction plant.
           The use          of   gas turbines              of the      aeroderivative               type,
   moreover,            allows       the      number        of     revs     of    the      turbine       to
   be     regulated             and      consequently              the     power         supplied        in
   relation           to     the    load      and      functioning          conditions            of   the
15 remaining components of the circuit.
           The      possibility            of      regulating           the      speed        of    these
   aeroderivative                 gas     turbines           and     their        arrangement            on
   parallel               compression                  lines,         allows              maintenance
   interventions                 to      be      effected           without          stopping          the
20 cooling          circuit.         In     this       way,      the    availability              of   the
   plant is maximized.
           Said       gas      turbines          of      the    aeroderivative                type     are
   also      more       compact        with      respect        to the        common       industrial
   gas      turbines          of    the    heavy-duty             type,     thus        reducing       the
25 overall footprint of the cooling circuit.
           A    further         advantage           in     the    use     of    gas      turbines        of
   the     aeroderivative                type     lies      in    the    fact      that      this     type
   of    turbine         has      a   lower       gas      consumption          with       respect       to
                                                       -14-

   common alternative solutions.
        An additional          advantage        in   the     use of    gas   turbines
   of  the    aeroderivative            type   lies     in    the  fact    that    this
   type    of    turbine       does       not   need      great    power     for     the
 5 start-up, thus avoiding the use of auxiliary motors.
        By   arranging        said     compression         lines   in   parallel,       a
   wide    operative       flexibility          can    be     obtained,     as   these
   first    and     second      gas      turbines       of    the   aeroderivative
   type    can    be  started        without       depressurizing        said    first
10 and second compressors.
        In addition, the cooling circuit in accordance with
   the   present      disclosure           allows     some      of   the   equipment
   installed       in   said       plant      according         to  the     Split-MRTM
   configuration,         to    be      eliminated.         In   particular,       said
15 auxiliary motors          111',       111" of the Split-MRTM scheme are
   not   necessary      in     the     scheme     proposed       according     to    the
   present disclosure.
        As the power required by said first compressors 102
   ranges    from 80% to          100% of        the   total     power    suppliable
20 by     the      gas       turbines          101',        depending        on      the
   environmental conditions,                an excess cooling power of up
   to about      20% of the power suppliable                    by said first        gas
   turbines 101',        is available.
        Said portion of cooling power in excess provided by
25 the pre-cooling          system can be           used for cooling          the air
   at the inlet of said second gas turbines 101".
        As    is    known,      the      power     a  turbine       can   supply       is
   inversely proportional to the temperature of the air at

   temperature            of       the       air       at      the       inlet,         its     volume
   increases and the yield of the turbine decreases.
          In     particular,             auxiliary             exchangers            104    pre-cool
 5 the     air using the cooling power of the propane                                        circuit.
   The      heat      exchange            preferably,               but      not      necessarily,
   takes place through the use of an intermediate coolant.
          By    creating         an    inlet       air       chilling,          i.e.     by   cooling
   the     air    at   the      inlet       to   said        second        gas     turbines       101',
10 the       production            of      the       same          can      be       improved,          as
   illustrated in the                 illustrative graph of figure 4.
          In     particular,            figure          4    shows       a     first      curve       401
   relating         to   the      yields       of     a    plant       configured          according
   to     the     logic      of       aeroderivative                 turbines          in   parallel
15 without        pre-cooling            the    air       at     the    inlet,        and a     second
   curve        402    relating           to    the        yields        of      the     same     plant
   configured           according            to     the        logic        of      aeroderivative
   turbines          in    parallel            and        comprising              said     auxiliary
   exchangers          104    for pre-cooling                    the   air      at    the   inlet       of
20 said second gas turbines 101".
            In    the    example         of    figure         4,    it    can      be  noted      that,
   by     cooling       the       air     at     the        inlet      to      said      second       gas
   turbines          101",         a     higher          annual          production           of      the
   liquefaction           plant        is     obtained,            ranging         from about         10%
25 to about 20%.
          This benefit can be mainly obtained in places                                           where
   the      temperature           exceeds          200C        for     many        months      of     the
   year.

          In    very    hot      places,         in    fact,         the     yields        of  gas
   turbines       decrease        with      an     increase          in    the    temperature
   of    the air,     consequently a               re-use of the excess                   cooling
   power      for   cooling       the     air     at    the      inlet      to   said       second
