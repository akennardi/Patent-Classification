COOLING SYSTEM
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS
[0001] The present application is a divisional application of AU <removed-apn> of which is
incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
TECHNICAL FIELD
[0002] The present disclosure relates generally to cooling systems.
BACKGROUND
[0003] The rapid growth of internet services such as Web email, Web search, Web site hosting,
and Web video sharing is creating increasingly high demand for computing and storage power
from servers in data centers. While the performance of servers is improving, the power
consumption of servers is also rising despite efforts in low power design of integrated circuits.
For example, one of the most widely used server processors, AMD's Opteroo processor, runs at
up to 95 watts. Intel's Xeon server processor runs at between 110 and 165 watts. Processors are
only part of a server, however; other parts in a server such as storage devices consume
additional power.
[0004] Servers are typically placed in racks in a date center. There are a variety of physical
configurations for racks. A typical rack configuration includes mounting rails to which multiple
units of equipment, such as server blades, are mounted and stacked vertically within the rack.
One of the most widely used 19-inch rack is a standardized system for mounting equipment
such as 1U or 2U servers. One rack unit on this type of rack typically is 1.75 inches high and 19
inches wide. A rack-mounted unit that can be installed in one rack unit is commonly designated
as a 1U server, In data centers, a standard rack is usually densely populated with servers, storage
devices, switches, and/or telecommunications equipment. One or more cooling fans may be
mounted internally within a rack-mounted

unit to cool the unit. In some data centers, fanless rack-mounted units are used to increase
density and to reduce noise.
 O(05X   Rack-rnounted units may comprise servers, storage devices, and communication
devices.    Most rack-mounted units have relatively wide ranges of tolerable operating
tempe rature and humidity requirements. For example, the system operating temperature
range of the Hewlett-Packard (HP) ProLiant DL365 G5 Quad-Core Opteron processor
sener models is between 50T and 95F; the,i system operatic humidity range for the same
models is between 10% and 90% relative humidity.           The system operating temperature
raLe of the NetApp FAS6000 series filers is between 50"F and 105'F; the system operating
humidity range for the same models is between 20% and 80% relative humidity, There are
many places around the globe such as pails of the northeast and northwest region of the
United Stites where natural cool air may be suitable to cool          servers such as the HP
ProLiant servers and the NetApp filers during certain periods of a year,
 Ut06h   The power consumption of a rack densely stacked with servers powered by Opteron
or Xeon processors may be between 7,000 and 15,000 watts          As a result, server nacks can
produce very concentrated heat loads. The heat dissipated b the servers in the racks is
exhauisted to the data center room. The heat collectiveely generated by densely populated
racks can have-c an adverse effect on the performance and reliability of the equipment
installed in the racks, since they rely on the surrounding air for cooling. Accordingly,
heating, ventilation air conditioning (HVAC) systems are often an important part of the
design of an efficient data center.
 (it ~tA typical data center consumes 10 to 40 megawatts of power,             The majority of
energy consumption is divided between the operation of servers and HVAC systems.
HVAC systems have been estimated to account for between 25 to 40 per cent of power use
in data centers. For a data center that consumes 40 megawatts of power, the HAVC systems
may consume 10 to 16 megawatts of power. Significant cost savings can be achieved by
utilizing efficient cooling systems and methods that reduce energy use.           For example,
reducing the power consumption of IVAC systems from 25 percent to 10 percent of power
used in data centers translates to a savings ot 6 megawatts of power which is enough to
power thousands of residential homcs. The percentage of power used to cool the servers in
a data center is referred to as the cost-to-cool efficiency for a data center, Improving the
cost-to-cool efficiency for a data center is one of the important goals of efficient data center
design. For example, for a 40 megawxvatt data center, the monthly electricity cost is about
$1.46 million assuming 730 hours of operation per month and 50{05 per kilowatt hour.
                                                2

                                                   3
Improving the cost to cool efficiency from 25% to 10% translates to a saving of $219,000 per
month or $2.63 million a year.
[0008] In a data center room, server racks arc typically laid out in rows with alternating cold and
hot aisles between them. All servers are installed into the racks to achieve a front-to-back
airflow pattern that draws conditioned air in from the cold rows, located in front of the rack, and
ejects heat out through the hot rows behind the racks. A raised floor room design is commonly
used to accommodate an underfloor air distribution system, where cooled air is supplied through
vents in the raised floor along the cold aisles.
[0009] A factor in efficient cooling of data center is to manage the air flow and circulation
inside a data center. Computer Room Air Conditioners (CRAC) units supply cold air through
floor tiles including vents between the racks. In addition to servers, CRAC units consume
significant amounts of power as well. One CRAC unit may have up to three 5 horsepower
motors and up to 150 CRAC units may be needed to cool a data center. The CRAC units
collectively consume significant amounts of power in a data center. For example, in a data
center room with hot and cold row configuration, hot air from the hot rows is moved out of the
hot row and circulated to the CRAC units. The CRAC units cool the air. Fans powered by the
motors of the CRAC units supply the cooled air to an underfloor plenum defined by the raised
sub-floor. The pressure created by driving the cooled air into the underfloor plenum drives the
cooled air upwardly through vents in the subfloor, supplying it to the cold aisles where the
server racks are facing. To achieve a sufficient air flow rate, hundreds of powerful CRAC units
may be installed throughout a typical data center room. However, since CRAC units are
generally installed at the corners of the data center room, their ability to efficiently increase air
flow rate is negatively impacted. The cost of building a raised floor generally is high and the
cooling efficiency generally is low due to inefficient air movement inside the data center room.
In addition, the location of the floor vents requires careful planning throughout the design and
construction of the data center to prevent short circuiting of supply air. Removing tiles to fix
hot spots can cause problems throughout the system.

                     DESCRIPTION OF EXAMPLE EMBODIMENT(S)
 (0030 The following example embodinents and their aspects are described and illustrated
in conjunction with apparatuses. methods, and systems which are meant to be illustrative
examples, not limiting 1i scope.
  003 I  FIG. 1 illustrates an example server cooling system comprising lateral walls 100, a
floor 102, a roof 104, an enclosure 106, and a server rack 108. The lateral walls 100, the
floor 102 and the roof 104 define an inside space 118. Floor 102 may or may not be a
raised sub-floor. There may be halved openings I10 on dte roof 104 and valved openings
 114 on the lateral walls 100. The valved openings may' be connected to a control system
which is operable to selectively open or close each halved opening The enclosure 106 may
have a frame, panels, doors, and server rack ports, A server rack port is an opening In the
enclosure 106 that can be connected to one or more server racks 108, The enclosure 106
may be made of a variety of materials such as steel, composite materials, or carbon
materials that create a housing defining an interior space 116 that is substantially sealed
from the inside space 118. The enclosure 106 compriises at least one senver rack port that
allows one or more rack-mounted units installed in the sercr rack 108 to interface with the
interior space.   6 In one implementation., the a server rack port is an opening configured to
substantially conform to the outer contours of, and accommodate, a server rack 108. One or
more edges of the server rack port may include a gasket or other component that contacts
the server rack 108 and forms a substantially sealed interface. The server rack 108 may be
removably connected to the enclosure 106 through the server rack port in a substantially
sealed manner, hi sonic embodinents. one or more rack-mounted units are installed in the
server rack 108 such that respective front faces of the rack-mounted units interface with the
inside space 118, and that respective back faces of the rack-mounted units interface with the
interior space 1] 6 defined by the enclosure 106. An example rack-mounted unit may be a
server blade, data storage array or other functional device. A front-to-back air flow through
the rack-mounted units installed in the server rack 108 draws cooling air from the inside
space 1.18 and expels heated air to the interior space 116.
                                                6

  (112 The  3 enclosure 106 may be connected to valved openmgs 110 on the roof 104
through a connector 112 on a. top side of the enclosure.           In sonic embodiments, the
connector 112 may be made of metal ducts, In other embodiments, the connector 112 may
be made of soft and flexible materials so that the enclosure may be removably connected to
the valved openings 110. In some embodiments, the enclosure 106 may be mounted directly
to the floor 102. In other embodiments, the enclosure 106 may have wheels on the bottom
side and may be easily moved around in a data center.
 (0033 In some embodiments, the server rack 108 may be sparsely populated with servers
and other equipment. Since servers and other equipment are stacked vertically within the
rack, the scarcity may create open gaps to the interior space 116       Air may leak from the
interior space I16 through the open gaps. To prevent air leakage. the gaps may be blocked
by panels mounted to the server rack 108 that prevent air from escaping and entering the
enclosure 106 through the gaps.
 |(14    hI some embodinments. one or more an handling units 122 may dow external cool
air into the inside space 118. The cool air enters the server cooling system through valved
openings 114 on the lateral walls 100. One or more fans draw the cool air from the inside
space I18 through the front faces of the one or more rack-mounted units and expel heated
air through the back faces of the one or more rack-mounted units to the interior space 116.
The heated air passes through the connector 112 and leaves the interior space 116 through
the valved openings 110 on the roof 110. In some embodiments, the cooling fans mounted
internally withi n the rack-mounted units installed in the rack 108 draw the cool air from the
inside space I IS and expel heated air to the interior space 116; no additional air handling
units, in one implementation, are need to cool the rack-mounted units.                 In other
embodiments where faniess rack-mounted units are installed in the rack 108. one or more.
fans may be installed on one side of the rack 108 to draw air through the rack-mournted units
from the inside space 11.8 to the interior space 11.6 to cool the rack-mounted units installed
in the rack 108.
 11Y35   In some embodiments. there may be valved openings 120 on the enclosure 116. A
control system is operably connected to the valved openings 120, the valved openings 110
on the roof 104. and the valved openings 114 on the lateral walls 100. The control system is
operable to Selectively activate each of the valved openings based on temperatures observed
within arid outside the inside space 118 to achieve one or more desired air flows, When the
air external to the inside space I 18 is not suitable to be introduced to the inside space 118,
the control system closes the valved openings 110 and 114, and opens up the valved
                                                7

openings 120. To cool air in the inside space 118. one or more cooling units may be used.
 In some embodiments, the cooling units may be evaporative coolers which are devices that
cool air through the simple evaporation of xwiter.         Compared with refrigeration or
absorption air conditioning, evaporative cooling may be rnore energy efficient. Cooling air
is drawn from the inside space I18 through the        rack-moited units and heated air is
expelled to the interior space 116 defined by the enclosure 106.        Heated air inside the
enclosure 106 is exhausted to the inside space I18 through the valved openings 12.0. In
some embodiments, one or more fans may be used to exhaust the heated air out of the
enclosure 106,
  00)6   in other embodiments, one or more cooling units may be used while extemal air is
introduced to the inside space 118. The control system may open the valved openings 110,
 114, aid 120 simultaneoush.     Evaporative cooling units may be used in close proximity to
the valved openings 114 so that the external air may be cooled while being introduced to the
inside space 118.
  0i2ii  In yet other embodiments, the control system may open the valved openings 110,
and close valved openings 114 and 120 when the difference in temperature between the
outside and the insider space reaches certain configurable threshold values.         In other
embodiments, the control system may close valved openings 110, and open up valved
openings 114 and 120. To cool the air in the inside space 120, one or more evaporative
cooling units may be placed in the inside space 120 to provide cooling.
  0038 In some embodiments, the roof 104 comiprises a single-sloped roof xvhich may be
easy: to manufacture and install. In other embodiments, other types of roof configurations,
such as a gable roof, may be used. The lateral walls 100. the floor 102., and the roof 104
may be pre-manufactured in a factory and assembled on the construction site where a data
center is to be built. Pre-manufactured units may significantly reduce the cost to build a
data center. One of the cost advantages of the integrated building based air handler for
server farm cooling system is the convenience and low cost of pre-manufacture parts of the
system and the ease of installation of pre-manufactured parts in a data center.
   0 91 In some embodiments, the integrated building based air handler for server farm
cooling system illustrated in FIG. I obviates the need for raised subfloors, CRAC units and
xwattr chillers, A large number of parts of the cooling system may be pre-manlactured and
easily assembled, Natural cool air may be used to cool the servers. Cooling fans installed
internally withn the sercrs may provide the needed air flow to draw cooling air to cool the
servers; CRAC units and raised subfloors may no longer be needed. Efficient evaporative
                                               8

coolers may replace the water chillers which are costly to install and operate. Overall, the
cooling systems described herein may significantly reduce the construction cost, and
electricity power and water usage, of server farm deployments.

embodiments, the cooling fans mounted internally within the rack-mointed units installed
in the rack 208 draw the cooling air to the interior space 216 and no additional air handling
units are needed. In other embodiments where fanless rack-mount d units are installed in
the rack 208, one or more fans may be installed on one side of the rack 208 to draw air from
the inside space to the interior space 216 to cool the rack mounted limits installed in the
server rack 20i8, 1Heated air rises to the attic space 220 and is exhausted out of the cooling
system through the valved openings 224.

 '00)6' FIGS. IGA and 1013 illustrate an example of an air handler building structure 1000,
including a floor 1002, a plurality of lateral walls 1004. and a roof 1006. In this example,
the building structure 1000 may be pre-manufactured in a factory and assembled on the
construction site whcre a data center is to be built. As describe before. pre-manufactured
units may Signiicantly reduce the cost of the building structure 1000,        One of the cost
advantages of the air handler building structure 1000 for a sexr cooling system is the
convenience and low cost of pre-manufacture pars of the system and the ease of installation
of prc-manufactured parts in a data. center. The material of the building structure 1000
includes, but is not limited to, steel, composite material, carbon material, or any other
suitable material.
  0052 The floor 1002 in this example is a non-raised floor, which has a relative low initial
construction cost compared with a raised floor. It is understood that raised floor may be
partially or completely used. in the building stricture 1000 in other examples, 1he plurality
of lateral walls 1004 include a lower lateral wall 1004-a and an upper lateral wall 1004-b
opposing to each other Iaving different respective heights determined in accordance with a
ratio, As shown in FIG 10B, which is the top-view of the building structure 1000, the
plurality of lateral walls 1004 may also include two other lateral walls 1004-c, 1004-d
substantially perpendiculair to the lower and upper lateral walls 1004-a, 1004-b. The roof
 1006 may be constructed in accordance with a pitch consistent with the ratio associated with
the lower and upper lateral walls 1004-a. 1004-b. In other words, the roof 1006 is a sloped
roof with a pitch of Ix, where x is substnntially larger than one, so that snow builds up and
melts on the roof 1006, with the heat froin the interior of the building structure 1000
accelerates the snow-melting process, In one example, x equals to 6 (e.g., the pitch may be

2:12). In this example, the roof 1006 is a single-sloped roof (also known as a shed roof.    It
is understood that, in other examples, such as in FIGS. 8 and 9, the roof 1006 max be a
gable roof or any other suitable type of roof
  [005) One or more openings 1008, such as valved openings, may be located on different
parts of the building structure 1000, such as on one or more lateral walls 1004 and the roof
 1006.   I this example, the lower lateral wall 1004-a has one or more openings 1008-a
through which outside natural air may enter the building structure 1000. In one example,
the lower lateral wall I 004-a may be substantially louvered to facilitate the outside natural
air to enter the building structure 1000. In this example, the upper lateral wall 1004-b may
have one or more openings 1008-b through which air in the building structure 1000 can exit,
In one example, a portion of the upper lateral wail 1004-b that is above the height of the
lower lateral wall 1004-a may be substantially louvered to allow air to exit the building
structure 1000, Optionally, the roof 1006 may also include one or more openings 1008-c
through which air in the building structure 1000 can exit. It is understood thatt although
FIG. 1OA shows openings 1008-b. 1008-c on both the upper lateral wall 1004-b and the roof
 1006. this configuration may not be necessary in other examples.         As long as there are
openings above the height of the openings 1008-a on the lower lateral wall 1004-, air in the
building structure 1000 can exit the building structure 1000 via natural convection.
  00)9 Referring now to FIG. 1OB, a first dimension Li along a first direction is defined
between the lower and upper lateral walls 1004-a, 1004-b, and. a second dimension L2 along
a second direction is defined perpendicular to the first direction, in this example, between
the other two lateral walls 1004-c. 1004-d. As shown in FIG 10B. LI is smaller than L2.
The relative length of LI and L2 is designed such that the building structure 1000 provides
access to outside natural air via the one or more openings 1008-a on the lower lateral wall
 1004-a by increasing the area-volume-ratio of the building structure 1000, I) one example.
L2 may be twice of LI. Accordingly, the shape of the building structure 1000 allows air
within the building structure 1000 to rise via natural convection,         In other words, the
building structure 1000 is designed to take advantage of the warm air's tendency to rise to
achieve "free    cooling."    This natural "drafting" enhances the mechanically induced
movement of air and therefore reduces the overall power for cooling. With the design in
this example, the building structure 1000 itself serves well as an air handler even without
the traditional mechanical cooling system (i.e., by "free cooling").
 '00601 As sho.n in FIG. 10A. the building structure 1000 may include a ceiling 1010 that
divides the interior of the building structure 1000 into a first space 1012 and a second space
                                               16

 1014, In this example, the first space 10 12, which may be used for installing servers of a
data center, is defined between the floor 1002 and the ceiling 1010 the second space 1014,
as an attic space, is defined between the ceiling 1010 and the roof 1006, lhe ceiling 1010
may have one or more openings 1008-d located at different regions of the ceilig 1010. In
this example, at least one opening 1008-d is located near the openings 1008-a on the lower
lateral wall 1004-a where the outside natural air enters the building structure 1000. With
such configuration, the outside natural air enters the first space 1012 through the openings
 1008-a on the lower lateral wall 1004-a and exits the first space 1012, by natural
convection, through the openings 1008-d on the ceiling 1010 to enter the second space
 1014.    The air in the second space 1014 then exits. by natural convection, through the
openings 1008-b on the portion of the upper lateral wall 1004-b above the ceflin            1.010
and/or the openings 1008-c on the roof 1006, The air in the second space 1014 may., also
enter the first space 1012 through the openings 1008-d on the ceiling 1010 near the lower
lateral -all 1004-a and may be mixed wiith the natural air entered the first space 1012.
 001itFIG      I I i lltrates an example of a server cooling system .1100, In this example, the
system 1100 includes a first space 1 -102 defined by a floor 1104, one or more lateral walls
 I 106 and a ceiling I 108. A plhrality of servers 1110 may be installed in the first space
 1102.   The system 1100, in this example, also includes a second space 1.112, as an attic
space, defined by the ceiling 1108 and a roof 1114. One or more openings 1116, such as
valved opening,&may be located on at least one of the ceiling 1108, the roof 1114, and at
least one of the lateral walls 1106. In this example, the first late al wall (eg. a lower lateral
wall) 1106-a has one or more openings I116-a the ceiling               has one or more openngs  M108
 I116-d, including at least one opening 1116-d near the lower lateral wall 1106-a; a portion
of a second lateral wall (e., an upper lateral wall) 1106-b above the ceiling 1108 (in the
second space 1112) and/or the roof 1114 include one or more openings 111.6-b, I 16-c,
respectively.    The openings 1116, as described above, are used to realize the movement of
air between the outside. space. the first space 1102, and the second space 1112.
 0062) In this example, the sy stem 1100 includes an air inlet I118 coupled with the first
lateral wvall 1106~a and operahle to allow outside natural air to enter the first space 1102.
The air inlet 1118, in this example, includes one or more louvered openings 1116-a on the
first lateral wvall 1106-a. The svstern 1100 may also mnlude an aim outlt 1120 coupled with
the second lateral wall 1106-b and operable to allow air in the second space 1112 to exit.
The air outlet I 20, in this example, includes one or more louvered opeinigs 1116-b on the
second lateral wall I 106-b. The system I 100 may further include one or more air-handling
                                                17

units 1122 coupled with the air inlet 1118 to draw the outside natural air and to provide air
to the first sjce 1102 The air-hatndling units 1122 include, for example, a fim 11:22-a an
evaporative cooling unit 1122-b configured to generate evapo)rative cooling air based on the
outside natural air, and in some embodiments a filter 1122-c configured to filter the outside
natural air entering the first space 1102. The fan I .22-a may be a speed controlled far and
is designed to keep air turbulence high which helps mitigate temperature gradients and
induces mixing, Optionally, the system 1100 may also inchide one or more unintermuptible
power supply (UPS) systems utilizing kinetic stored energy.
 |00'3 In tis example, the system 1100 also includes a control system 1124 confinured to
control the one or more air-handling units 1122 to provide air to the first space 1102 in
accordance with temperatures measured within and outside of the first space 1102. The
control system 1124 iany include one or more devices such as a microprocessor,
microcontroller, digital signal processor, or combinations thereof capable of executing
stored instructions and operating upon stored data. Control system arrangements are well
known to those having ordinary skill in the art, for example, in the form of embedded
system, laptop, desktop, tablet, or server computers.
  0064 The control system 1124 may include or couple to one or more sensors (not shown)
to monitor the environmental metric such as temperature and humidity within and Outside
the first space 1102.     For example, temperature sensors may be deployed at different
locations in the first space 1102, the second space 1112, and space outside the server
cooling system 1100 to provide real-time temperatures of various locations. In one example,
hot aisle (hot row enclosure) temperature of the server racks in the first .1102 may be used to
regulate speed controlled fans; cold aisle (cold row enclosure) temperature of the server
racks in the first 1102 and outside air temperature and humidity may be used to provide an
indication of outdoor and return air mixing ef-fciencies. Dew point sensors and/or humidity
sensors may also be provided in the air inlet 1118 and the air-handling units 1122 to
monitor the humility of the air entering the first space 1102. It is understood that, although
the control system 1124 in FIG. 11 is installed in the second space 1112, it may be installed
in other places within the server cooling system 1100 or outside the server cooling system
 1100, In this example, the control system 1124 is operatively coupled to the air-handling
units 1122 and other components of the server conling system 1100, such as but not limited
to an air-exchanging unit 1126, which may be coupled to the openings 12 14-d on the ceiling
 1108 near the first lateral wall 1106-a and nm be configured to draw air from the second
space 1112 into the first space. 1102 in order to mix with the outside natural air entering the
                                               18

first space 1102, The connections between the control system 1124 and other components
of the system 1100 may be achieved using any known wire or wireless communication
techniques.
 0065) Depending on the measured temperatures within aid outside of the first space 1102,
the control system I124 may control the operations of the air-handling units 1122 in
conjunction with other components of the server cooling system 1100 in, for example three
different work ig modes at three different temperature ranges.
 000W In a first range, which is an optimal working temperature range for the servers 1110,
the control system 1124 may control the air-handling units 1122 in conjunction with the air
exchanging unit 1126 to directly provide the outside natural air into the first space 1102 to
achieve the so called "free cooling." Specifically, in this mode, the control system 1124
may tum off the evaporative cooling unit I 122-b and turn on the fan I I22-a to directly draw
tle outside natural air into the irst space 1102 without extra cooling.         Optionally, the
control system 1124 may also turn on the filter 1122-c to filter the incoming natural air. In
this mode, the control system 1124 may further turn off the air exchanging unit 1126 to stop
miing the incoming natural air in the first space 1102 with the heated air from the second
space I112, which may increase the temperature in the first space 1102. in one example,
the first range is substantially between 70 'F and 85 'F.
 006! in a second range, wNvhich is lower than the first range, the control system 1124 may
control the air-handling units 1122 in conjunction with the air-exchanging unit 1 126 to
provide air to the first space 1102 based on a mixed outside natural air and air exhausted
from the servers 1110 through one or more openings 1116-d on the ceiling 1108 near the air
inlet 1118. Specifically, in this mode,. the control system 1124 may turn off the evaporative
cooling unit I122-b and turn on the fan 1122-a to draw the outside natural air into the first
space 1102. Optionally, the control system      1 24 may turn on the filter H 22-c to filter the
incoming natmal air. In this mode, the control system 1124 may turn on the air-exchanging
unit 1126 to draw tie air exhausted through the servers I1 10 into the second space 1112 to
the first space 1102 in order to heat up the incoiniug natural air in the first space 1102. In
this example, the air-exchanging unit 1126 may include a damper, a return fan coupled with
the openings 1106-d. and a recirculation fan to help blend the miing air, preventing any
temperature or humidity cadments, In one example, the second range is about below 70*F
  068 In a third range, which is higher than the first range, the control system 11.24 may
control the air-handling units 1122 in conjunction with the air-exchanging unit 1.126 to
provide evaporative cooling air to the first space 1102 based on the outside natural air
                                               19

drawn from the air inlet .1118 through saturated media.         Specifically, in this mode., the
control system 1124 may turn on both the evaporative cooling unit 1122-h and the fan 1122
a to draw the outside natural air into the first space 1102 and cool it down by evaporative
cooling.   Optionally, the control system 1124 may turn on the filter 1122-c to filter the
incoming natural air In this mode, the control sy stem I 124 may tum off the air-cxchanging
unit 1126 to stop mixing the incoming natural air in the first space 1102 with the heated air
front the second space 1112. Optionally, a dew point sensor may be used in con junction
with t.he evaporative media of the evaporative cooing unit 1122-b to ensure additional
moisture is not added to already saturated air.         In one example, the second range is
suhstaitially between 85 Wand 110 *F,
  0069' It is noted that in any temperature range, the control system 1124 may be further
confuiured to selectively activate one or more of the openings I116-a on the first lateral
 wall I106-a to control the amount of the outside natural air drawn into the first space 1102
based on the temperatures measured within and outside of the first place 1102. In addition,
when the measured tempematuie is above 110         F. additional mechanical cooling units and
air-conditioning units may be turned on to provide extra cooling.
   )072, The first space 1102 of the system 1100 may further include at least one
substantially enclosed interior space I128 engaging the ceiling 1108 and open to the second
space 1112 and at least one rack 1130 engaging the interior space 1128 in a substantially
sealed manner and having the piLuralit' of serversI 1110 mounted thereon. The interior space
 1 128 may be defined by an enclosure having a frame, panels, doors, and rack ports. The
enclosure of the interior space -112.8 may be made of a variut       of materials such as steel,
composite materials, or carbon materials,       The enclosure creates a housing defining the
interior space 1128 that is substantially sealed from the first space 1102. The enclosure of
the interior space 1128 includes at least one rack port that allows one or more ser.vers 1.110
installed in the tacks I I30 to interface with the interior space 1128. One or more edges of
the rack port may include a gasket or other component that conacts the rack 1130 and
forms a substantially sealed interface. Ti     rack 1130 may be removably connected to the
enclosure of the interior space 1128 through the. rack port in a substantially sealed manner.
 |0021' In this example, one or more servers 1110 are installed i-n the racks 1130 such that
respective front faces of the servers 1110 interface with the first space 1102, and that
respective back faces of the servers 1110 interface with the interior space I128. In this
example, each rack-mounted server 1110 may include one or mor'e fans 11.32 therein
                                                20

operable to draw air from the first space .1102 through its front face and expel heated air to
the interior space 1128 through its back face.
 00722 The server cooling system 1100 can maintain a properly mixed server supply air in
an optimal wxorkig temperature range, for example between 70 *F and 85 'F and in a non
condensing relative humidity range, for example below 85%.
 00231 FIG, 12 illustrates another example of a server cooling system 1200. The system
 1200 includes a first space 1202 defined by a floor 1204, a pluality of lateral walls 1206,
and a ceiling 1208 and a second space 12.10 defined by the ceiling 1208 and a sloped roof
 121.2 constructed in accordance with a pitch. One or more openings 1214, such as valved
openrings, may be located on it least one of the roof 1212, the ceiling 1208, and at least one
of the lateral walls 1206, that enable outside natural air to enter the first space 1202 and air
in the second space 1210 to exit by natural convection. The system 1.200 may also include
at least one interior space 1216 inside the first space 1202, that is substantially enclosed and
engaging the ceiling 1208, and at least one rack 1218 engaging the interior space 1216 in a
substantiallv sealed manner and having a plurality of servers 1220 mounted thereon. In this
example, one or more servers 1220 are installed in the racks -12 18 such that respective front
faces of the servers 1220 Interface With the first space 1202, and that respective back faces
of the servers 1220 interface with the interior space 1216,        In this example, each rack
mounted server 1220 may include one or more fans 1222 therein operable to draw air from
the first space 1202 through its front peace   and expel heated air to the interior space 1216
through its back face
 004 The building stucture in FIG. 12 is similar to that in FIGS. 10A and 10B, wv-hich is
designed to take advantage of natural convention to enhance the mechanically induced
movement of air and therefore reduce the overall energy necessary for cooling the servers.
The example server cooling system 1200 in FIG 12 is similar to that in FIG, II except that
system 1200 does not include the external air-handling units and air exchanging units such
as fans and evaporative cooling unit. The air circulation is induced by the internal fans
 1222 of the seivers 1220 and the natural convection enhanced by the special designed
building structure. Accordingly, the total energy consumption of the sy stem 1200 in FIG.
 12 may be further reduced compared w.'ith the system 1100 in FIG. 11,
 002     FIGH 13 illistrates a cross-section of another exemplian air handler building
structure 1300. The air handler building structure 1300 is similar to air handler building
structure 1000, including a floor 1.302, a plurality of lateral walls 1304. The floor 1302 in
                                                21

this exemplarv embodiment can be a non-raised floor, It is understood that a raised floor
may be partialI or completely used in the building structure 1300 in other embodiments.
  0026 The air handler building structure 1300) has two roof portions 1306. synmetrically
placed on either side of a protruding portion 1322. [he protruding portion 1307 is higher
  bthan the highest part of the roof portions 1306, and placed above the center of the building
in cross-section. The roof portions 1306, and the protruding portion 1322 extend along the
air handler building structure 1300 in a direction perpendicular to die cross-section in FIG.
 13.
 |0077' The protruding portion 1322 has lateral walls 1324 and roof portions 1326. The
lateral walls 1304, 1324 and the roof portions 1306, 1326 are constructed in a similar
manner to lateral walls 1004 and the roof portions 1006.
  00781 The roof portions 1306. like the roof portions 1006 may be constructed in
accordance with a pitch of I:x, where x is substantially larger than one, so that snow builds
up and melts on the roof 1006, with the heat frot the interior of the building structure 1300
accelerating the snow-mielting process. In one example, x equals to 6.
 |007      One or more openings I30$ such as valved openings, may be located on different
parts of the building structure 1300, such as on ote or more lateral walls 1304 and the roof
portions 1306,      in this example, the lower lateral wall 1304-a has one or more openings
 1308-a through which outside natural air may enter the building structure 1300. In one
example, die lateral wall                       a304 louvered to facilitate the outside natural
                                   may he substantially
air to enter the building structure 1300. in this example, the lateral walls 1324 of the
protruding portion 1312 may have one or more openings 1308-b through which air in the
building structure 1300 can exit. in one example, a portion of the lateral walls 1324 are
above the height of the lateral wall 1304 may be substantially louvered to allow air to exit
the building structure 1300.      Optionally, the roof portions 306 may also include one or
more openings 1308-c through which air in the building structure 1300 can exit. It is
understood that, although FIG. 13 shows openings 1308-c on the roof portion 1306, this
configuration may not be necessary in other examples. As long as tieme are openings 1308
above the height of the openings 1308-a on the lateral wall 1304, air in the building
structure 1300 caii exit the building structure 1300 via natural convection.
 |t080) The additional height of the one or more openings I 308-b on the lateral walls 1324
above the height of the openmgs 1308-a on the lateal ill           1304 increases the natural
convection in the building structure 1300 over that of the building structure 1000.
                                                 22

 (0081F As shown in HG. 13, the building struCtur        .1300 may include a ceiling 13 10 that
divides the interior of the building stricture 1300 into a first space L3 12 and a second space
 1314. In this example, the first space 1312 , which may be used for installing servers of a
data center, is defined between the floor 1302 and the ceiling 1110; the second space 1314,
as an attic space, is defined between the ceiling 1.3 10 and the roof 1306 and the protruding
portion 1322. The ceiling 1310 may have one or more openings 1308-d located at different
regions of the ceiling 1310. In this example. at least one opening 1308-d is located near the
openings 1308-a on the lower lateral wall 1304-a where the outside natural air enters the
building structure 1300. With such configuration, the outside natural air enters the first
space     12 through the openings 1308-a on the lateral wall 1304 and exits the first space
 1312, by natural convection, through the openings I 308-d on the ceiling B 10 to enter the
second space 1314. The air in the second space 1314 then exits, by natural convection,
through the openings 1308-b on the protruding portion 1322 above the ceiling 13 10 and/or
the openings 1308-c on the roof portion 1306. The air in the second space 1314 iay also
enter the first space 1312 through the openings 1308-d on the ceiling 1310near the lateral
wxall 1304-a and may be i mixed with the natural air entered into the first space 1312,
  0082 HG 14 illustrates a cross-section of an other example of an anr handler building
structure 1400 that is similar to the building structure 1300 but without the cel ing 1310 and
opening 1308-.     (other features have the same labels as in FIG. 13) The natural convection
draws air through openings 1308-a which rises through the building structure 1400 mid out
through openings 1308-b.
  0083) The various examples of the building structures and server cooling systemnis
disclosed herein can achieve an almost 100% uptiie availability, for example,           99.98%
uptime availability for a data center falcity., for example, having a 9.0 MW critical load.
The various examples of the building structures and server cooling systems disclosed herein
can allow for free cooling, for example, 99% of the year via the building structures' unique
shape and orientation, as well as server physical configuration, Also, the various examples
of the building structures and server cooling systems disclosed herein can achieve about 2%
annualized "cost to cool" with evaporative cooling, where "cost to cool" is the energy (kW)
expended to remove the heat generated by the data center load as a percentage of the data
center load itself     Further, the various examples of the buiding structures and server
cooling systems disclosed herein. can save, for example, about 36 million gallons of water
used for cooling compared with conventional water-cooled chiller plant designs xwith
comparable IT loads. The various examples of the building structures and server cooling
                                               23

systems disclosed herein can achieve high efficiency to a target power usage effectiveness
(PUE.) of, for example, less than about I .11, such as 1,08. Moreover, the various examples
of the building structures and server cooling systems disclosed herein can achie.        about
40% reductions in data center electricity consumption relative to industr- typical legacy data
centers. For example, for a data center ith a 9 MW of critical load, various examples of
the building structures and server cooling systems disclosed herein can reduce energy
consumption of 8.6 to 189 million KWh per year compared with conventional collocated
facilities. Because water-cooled chiller may not be required in the exemplary server cooling
systems disclosed herein, there may be zero data center-related wastewater generated by the
server coolimg systems, which equals to a reduction of about 8 million gallons of sewer
discharge per year compared        with conventional     water-cooled   chiller plant design.
Ftirthermore, the various examples of the buildim      structures and server cooling systems
disclosed herein can reduce the construction cost compared with traditional designs, for
example, to nio more than S 5M per MW and reduce the construction time to, for example,
less than 6 months. In one example, the various examples of the building structures and
server cooling systems disclosed herein can maintain the following room environmental
requirements: room temperature of 554.F - 904F, no higher than 85% non-condensing
relative humidity, pressure of ±0.1 1 inches H20, and 5.44F per hour of rate of temperature
change.     The various examples of the building structures and server cooling systems
disclosed herein can withstand 100-year temperature and humidity conditions and extremely
Iow winter temperatures while maintaining server room erviromirental requirements.

examlples of the building structures and server cooling systems disclosed herein.               In
additon, minimized use of evapoiative cooling as compared to standard cooling methods
may yield a 99% reduction in water use at the facility (and a corresponlding reduction in
wastewater outflow) as compared to a traditional data center that uses water cooled chillers.
The carbon savings below assumes an average U.S. carbon intensity of1036 tons CO2/M'\h.
In other examples, the actual carbon reductions may be much Iower by v irtue of how clean
ekectricity~is in all three sites (0,31 tons CO2/MWhI for Santa Clara, and close to zero for
both W~A state and NY state).
