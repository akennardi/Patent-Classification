BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
[0002]      Cells from most major human solid and hematologic malignancies exhibit
abnormal cellular localization of a variety of oncogenic proteins, tumor suppressor proteins,
and cell cycle regulators (Cronshaw et al, 2004, Falini et al 2006). For example, certain p53
mutations lead to localization in the cytoplasm rather than in the nucleus. This results in the
loss of normal growth regulation, despite intact tumor suppressor function. In other tumors,
wild-type p53 is sequestered in the cytoplasm or rapidly degraded, again leading to loss of its
suppressor function. Restoration of appropriate nuclear localization of functional p53 protein
can normalize some properties of neoplastic cells (Cai et al, 2008; Hoshino et al 2008; Lain et
al 1999a; Lain et al 1999b; Smart et al 1999), can restore sensitivity of cancer cells to DNA
damaging agents (Cai et al, 2008), and can lead to regression of established tumors (Sharpless
& DePinho 2007, Xue et al, 2007). Similar data have been obtained for other tumor
suppressor proteins such as forkhead (Turner and Sullivan 2008) and c-Abl (Vignari and
Wang 2001). In addition, abnormal localization of several tumor suppressor and growth
regulatory proteins may be involved in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases (Davis
2007, Nakahara 2009). CRM1 inhibition may provide particularly interesting utility in
familial cancer syndromes (e.g., Li-Fraumeni Syndrome due to loss of one p53 allele,
BRCA1 or 2 cancer syndromes), where specific tumor suppressor proteins (TSP) are deleted
or dysfunctional and where increasing TSP levels by systemic (or local) administration of
CRM1 inhibitors could help restore normal tumor suppressor function.
[0003]      Specific proteins and RNAs are carried into and out of the nucleus by specialized
transport molecules, which are classified as importins if they transport molecules into the
nucleus, and exportins if they transport molecules out of the nucleus (Terry et al, 2007;
Sorokin et al 2007). Proteins that are transported into or out of the nucleus contain nuclear

                                                -2
import/localization (NLS) or export (NES) sequences that allow them to interact with the
relevant transporters. Chromosomal Region Maintenance 1 (Crml), which is also called
exportin-1 or Xpol, is a major exportin.
 [0004]      Overexpression of Crml has been reported in several tumors, including human
ovarian cancer (Noske et al, 2008), cervical cancer (van der Watt et al, 2009), pancreatic
cancer (Huang et al, 2009), hepatocellular carcinoma (Pascale et al, 2005) and osteosarcoma
(Yao et al, 2009) and is independently correlated with poor clinical outcomes in these tumor
types.
 [0005]      Inhibition of Crml blocks the exodus of tumor suppressor proteins and/or growth
regulators such as p53, c-Abl, p21, p27, pRB, BRCA1, IkB, ICp27, E2F4, KLF5, YAPI,
ZAP, KLF5, HDAC4, HDAC5 or forkhead proteins (e.g. FOXO3a) from the nucleus that are
associated with gene expression, cell proliferation, angiogenesis and epigenetics. Crml
inhibitors have been shown to induce apoptosis in cancer cells even in the presence of
activating oncogenic or growth stimulating signals, while sparing normal (untransformed)
cells. Most studies of Crml inhibition have utilized the natural product Crml inhibitor
Leptomycin B (LMB). LMB itself is highly toxic to neoplastic cells, but poorly tolerated
with marked gastrointestinal toxicity in animals (Roberts et al, 1986) and humans (Newlands
et al, 1996). Derivatization of LMB to improve drug-like properties leads to compounds that
retain antitumor activity and are better tolerated in animal tumor models (Yang et al, 2007,
Yang et al, 2008, Mutka et al, 2009). Therefore, nuclear export inhibitors could have
beneficial effects in neoplastic and other proliferative disorders. To date, however, small
molecule, drug-like Crml inhibitors for use in vitro and in vivo are uncommon.
 [0006]      In addition to tumor suppressor proteins, Crml also exports several key proteins
that are involved in many inflammatory processes. These include IkB, NF-kB, Cox-2, RXRa,
 Commd1, HIF1, HMGB1, FOXO, FOXP and others. The nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB/rel)
 family of transcriptional activators, named for the discovery that it drives immunoglobulin
kappa gene expression, regulate the mRNA expression of variety of genes involved in
 inflammation, proliferation, immunity and cell survival. Under basal conditions, a protein
 inhibitor of NF-kB, called IkB, binds to NF-kB in the nucleus and the complex IkB-NF-kB
 renders the NF-kB transcriptional function inactive. In response to inflammatory stimuli, IkB
 dissociates from the IkB-NF-kB complex, which releases NF-kB and unmasks its potent
 transcriptional activity. Many signals that activate NF-kB do so by targeting IkB for
 proteolysis (Phosphorylation of IkB renders it "marked" for ubiquitination and then

                                                -3
proteolysis). The nuclear IkBa-NF-kB complex can be exported to the cytoplasm by Crml
where it dissociates and NF-kB can be reactivated. Ubiquitinated IkB may also dissociate
from the NF-kB complex, restoring NF-kB transcriptional activity. Inhibition of Crml
induced export in human neutrophils and macrophage like cells (U937) by LMB not only
results in accumulation of transcriptionally inactive, nuclear IkBa-NF-kB complex but also
prevents the initial activation of NF-kB even upon cell stimulation (Ghosh 2008, Huang
2000). In a different study, treatment with LMB inhibited IL-1P induced NF-kB DNA
binding (the first step in NF-kB transcriptional activation), IL-8 expression and intercellular
adhesion molecule expression in pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (Walsh 2008).
COMMD1 is another nuclear inhibitor of both NF-kB and hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF1)
transcriptional activity. Blocking the nuclear export of COMMD1 by inhibiting Crml results
in increased inhibition of NF-kB and HIF1 transcriptional activity (Muller 2009).
[00071      Crml also mediates Retinoid X receptor a (RXRa) transport. RXRa is highly
expressed in the liver and plays a central role in regulating bile acid, cholesterol, fatty acid,
steroid and xenobiotic metabolism and homeostasis. During liver inflammation, nuclear
RXRa levels are significantly reduced, mainly due to inflammation-mediated nuclear export
of RXRa by Crml. Lep B is able to prevent IL-1 P induced cytoplasmic increase in RXRa
levels in human liver derived cells (Zimmerman 2006).
[0008]      The role of Crml-mediated nuclear export in NF-kB, HIF-I and RXRa signalling
suggests that blocking nuclear export can be potentially beneficial in many inflammatory
processes across multiple tissues and organs including the vasculature (vasculitis, arteritis,
polymyalgia rheumatic, atherosclerosis), dermatologic (see above), rheumatologic
(rheumatoid and related arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, spondyloarthropathies, crystal
arthropathies, systemic lupus erythematosus, mixed connective tissue disease, myositis
syndromes, dermatomyositis, inclusion body myositis, undifferentiated connective tissue
disease, Sjogren's syndrome, scleroderma and overlap syndromes, etc.).
[0009]       CRM1 Inhibition affects gene expression by inhibiting/activating a series of
transcription factors like ICp27, E2F4, KLF5, YAP 1, ZAP
[0010]       Crml inhibition has potential therapeutic effects across many dermatologic
syndromes including inflammatory dermatoses (atopy, allergic dermatitis, chemical
dermatitis, psoriasis), sun-damage (Ultraviolet / UV damage), and infections. CRM1
inhibition, best studied with LMB, showed minimal effects on normal keratinocytes, and
exerted anti-inflammatory activity on keratinocytes subjected to UV, TNFa, or other

                                                 -4
inflammatory stimuli (Kobayashi & Shinkai 2005, Kannan & Jaiswal 2006). Crml inhibition
also upregulates NRF2 (nuclear factor erythroid-related factor 2) activity, which protects
keratinocytes (Schafer et al, 2010, Kannan & Jaiswal 2006) and other cell types (Wang et al,
2009) from oxidative damage. LMB induces apoptosis in keratinocytes infected with
oncogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) strains such as HPV16, but not in uninfected
keratinocytes (Jolly et al, 2009).
 [0011]      Crml also mediates the transport of key neuroprotectant proteins that may be
useful in neurodegenerative diseases including Parkinson's Disease (PD), Alzheimer's
Disease, and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. For example, (1) forcing nuclear retention of
key neuroprotective regulators such as NRF2 (Wang 2009), FOXA2 (Kittappa et al, 2007),
parking in neuronal cells and/or by (2) inhibiting NFKB transcriptional activity by
sequestering IB to the nucleus in glial cells, Crml inhibition could slow or prevent neuronal
cell death found in these disorders. There is also evidence linking abnormal glial cell
proliferation to abnormalities in CRM1 levels or CR1 function (Shen 2008).
[0012]      Intact nuclear export, primarily mediated through CRM1, is also required for the
intact maturation of many viruses. Viruses where nuclear export, and/or CRM1 itself, has
been implicated in their lifecycle include human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), adenovirus,
simian retrovirus type 1, Borna disease virus, influenza (usual strains as well as HINI and
avian H5N1 strains), hepatitis B (HBV) and C (HCV) viruses, human papillomavirus (HPV),
respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), Dungee, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus,
yellow fever virus, West Nile Virus, herpes simplex virus (HSV), cytomegalovirus (CMV),
and Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCV). (Bhuvanakantham 2010, Cohen 2010, Whittaker
1998). It is anticipated that additional viral infections reliant on intact nuclear export will be
uncovered in the near future.
[00131      The HIV-1 Rev protein, which traffics through nucleolus and shuttles between the
nucleus and cytoplasm, facilitates export of unspliced and singly spliced HIV transcripts
containing Rev Response Elements (RRE) RNA by the CRM1 export pathway. Inhibition of
Rev-mediated RNA transport using CRM1 inhibitors such as LepB or PKF050-638 can arrest
the HIV- 1 transcriptional process, inhibit the production of new HIV- 1 virions, and thereby
reduce HIV-1 levels (Pollard 1998, Daelemans 2002).
[0014]      Dengue virus (DENV) is the causative agent of the common arthropod-borne viral
disease, dengue fever (DF), and its more severe and potentially deadly dengue hemorrhagic
fever (DHF). DHF appears to be the result of an over exuberant inflammatory response to

                                              -5
DENV. NS5 is the largest and most conserved protein of DENV. CRM1 regulates the
transport of NS5 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, where most of the NS5 functions are
mediated. Inhibition of CRM1 mediated export of NS5 results in altered kinetics of virus
production and reduces induction of the inflammatory chemokine interleukin-8 (IL-8),
presenting a new avenue for the treatment of diseases caused by DENV and other medically
important flaviviruses including Hepatitis C virus (Rawlinson 2009).
 [00151     Other virus-encoded RNA-binding proteins that use CRM1 to exit the nucleus
include the HSV type 1 tegument protein (VP 13/14, or hUL47), human CMV protein pp65,
the SARS Coronavirus ORF 3b Protein, and the RSV matrix (M) protein (Williams 2008,
Sanchez 2007, Freundt 2009, Ghildyal 2009).
[0016]      Interestingly, many of these viruses are associated with specific types of human
cancer including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) due to chronic HBV or HCV infection,
cervical cancer due to HPV, and Merkel cell carcinoma associated with MCV. CRM1
inhibitors could therefore have beneficial effects on both the viral infectious process as well
as on the process of neoplastic transformation due to these viruses.
[00171      CRM1 controls the nuclear localization and therefore activity of multiple DNA
metabolizing enzymes including histone deacetylases (HDAC), histone acetyltransferases
(HAT), and histone methyltransferases (HMT). Suppression of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy
with irreversible CRM1 inhibitors has been demonstrated and is believed to be linked to
nuclear retention (and activation) of HDAC 5, an enzyme known to suppress a hypertrophic
genetic program (Monovich et al, 2009). Thus, CRM1 inhibition may have beneficial effects
in hypertrophic syndromes, including certain forms of congestive heart failure and
hypertrophic cardiomyopathies.
[00181      CRM1 has also been linked to other disorders. Leber's disorder, a hereditary
disorder characterized by degeneration of retinal ganglion cells and visual loss, is associated
with inaction of the CRMl switch (Gupta N 2008). There is also evidence linking
neurodegenerative disorders to abnormalities in nuclear transport.
[0019]      In view of the above, the discovery of compounds that modulate nuclear transport
is desirable.

[00891      In some embodiments, the compound of the invention is selected from any one of
compounds 1 to 11. In one aspect of these embodiments, the compound is selected from any
one of compounds 1, 2, 3, 4, 8 and 11.
[0090]       Pharmacokinetics (PK) play an increasing role in drug discovery and
development. Pharmacokinetics is the quantitative study of the time course of drug
absorption, distribution, metabolism and/or excretion. When a drug is administered, it
distributes rapidly from its administration site into the systemic blood circulation. One
measure of the extent of a therapeutic agent's distribution is the area under the plasma
concentration-time curve (AUC), calculated to the last measured concentration (AUCt) and
extrapolated to infinity (AUCnf). AUC is thus a frequently used metric to quantitate drug
exposure.

                                                -17
[00911       In general, the higher the exposure of a therapeutic agent, the greater the effects of
the agent. However, high exposure of a therapeutic agent may have deleterious effects on
certain tissues such as the brain. While the blood-brain barrier (BBB), a protective network
consisting of tight junctions between endothelial cells, restricts the diffusion of hydrophilic
and/or large molecules, drugs with high AUC are still capable of penetrating the BBB and/or
cerebrospinal fluid. Such penetration is often undesirable and can lead to unwanted side
effects. Current drug discovery efforts are aimed, in part, at striking a balance between
maximizing drug exposure (i.e. AUC) while minimizing brain penetration.
 [00921      The brain to plasma (B:P) ratio is once such method of quantifying the relative
distribution of a therapeutic agent in brain tissue to that in circulation. Such a ratio provides
one indication of the brain penetration of a given therapeutic agent. A high brain to plasma
ratio is preferred when targeting diseases localized in the central nervous system (CNS),
including the brain and the cerebrospinal fluid. However, a lower brain to plasma ratio is
generally preferable for non-CNS therapeutic agents to minimize brain penetration to avoid
potential side effects. Thus, a low brain to plasma ratio is preferable to avoid unwanted
 accumulation of therapeutic agents in the brain and CNS tissue.
 [00931      As set forth in more detail in the Example section, the compounds of the present
 invention display a higher AUC and/or a lower B:P as compared to other nuclear transport
 inhibitors, such as those disclosed in co-owned U.S. Patent Application No. 13/041,377, filed
 March 5, 2011 and published as US 2009/0275607 on November 10, 2011. In some
 embodiments, the present invention provides a compound of formula I, wherein the
 compound has <1p   jM (less than 1p VM ) nuclear export activity, an AUC"f of greater than
 about 3500; and a B:P of less than about 2.5 when dosed in a mouse at 10 mg/kg po.
 [0094]       The novel features of the present invention will become apparent to those of skill

  Compounds and Definitions

                                                - 18
[00951       Compounds of this invention include those described generally above, and are
further illustrated by the classes, subclasses, and species disclosed herein. As used herein, the
following definitions shall apply unless otherwise indicated. For purposes of this invention,
the chemical elements are identified in accordance with the Periodic Table of the Elements,
CAS version, Handbook of Chemistry and Physics,        7 5 th Ed. Additionally, general principles
of organic chemistry are described in "Organic Chemistry", Thomas Sorrell, University
Science Books, Sausalito: 1999, and "March's Advanced Organic Chemistry",             5 th Ed., Ed.:
Smith, M.B. and March, J., John Wiley & Sons, New York: 2001, the entire contents of
which are hereby incorporated by reference.
[00961       Unless specified otherwise within this specification, the nomenclature used in this
specification generally follows the examples and rules stated in Nomenclature of Organic
Chemistry, Sections A, B, C, D, E, F, and H, Pergamon Press, Oxford, 1979, which is
incorporated by reference herein for its exemplary chemical structure names and rules on
naming chemical structures. Optionally, a name of a compound may be generated using a
chemical naming program: ACD/ChemSketch, Version 5.09/September 2001, Advanced
Chemistry Development, Inc., Toronto, Canada.
[00971       Compounds of the present invention may have asymmetric centers, chiral axes,
and chiral planes (e.g., as described in: E. L. Eliel and S. H. Wilen, Stereo-chemistry of
Carbon Compounds, John Wiley & Sons, New York, 1994, pages 1119-1190), and occur as
racemates, racemic mixtures, and as individual diastereomers or enantiomers, with all
possible isomers and mixtures thereof, including optical isomers, being included in the
present invention.
 [00981      The term "halo" or "halogen" as used herein means halogen and includes, for
example, and without being limited thereto, fluoro, chloro, bromo, iodo and the like, in both
radioactive and non-radioactive forms.
 [0099]      The term "alkyl," as used herein, unless otherwise indicated, means straight or
branched saturated monovalent hydrocarbon radicals, typically C-C        12 , preferably CI-C 6 . As
 such, "C-C   6 alkyl" means a straight or branched saturated monovalent hydrocarbon radical
having from one to six carbon atoms (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6). Examples of alkyl groups
 include, but are not limited to, methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, and t-butyl.
 [001001     It is understood that substituents and substitution patterns on the compounds of the
 invention can be selected by one of ordinary skill in the art to provide compounds that are
 chemically stable and that can be readily synthesized by techniques known in the art, as well

                                                      -  19
as those methods set forth below. In general, the term "substituted," whether preceded by the
term "optionally" or not, means that one or more hydrogens of the designated moiety are
replaced with a suitable substituent. Unless otherwise indicated, an "optionally substituted
group" can have a suitable substituent at each substitutable position of the group and, when
more than one position in any given structure may be substituted with more than one
substituent selected from a specified group, the substituent can be either the same or different
at every position. Alternatively, an "optionally substituted group" can be unsubstitued.
[001011      Combinations of substituents envisioned by this invention are preferably those
that result in the formation of stable or chemically feasible compounds. If a substituent is
itself substituted with more than one group, it is understood that these multiple groups can be
on the same carbon atom or on different carbon atoms, as long as a stable structure results.
The term "stable," as used herein, refers to compounds that are not substantially altered when
subjected to conditions to allow for their production, detection, and, in certain embodiments,
their recovery, purification, and use for one or more of the purposes disclosed herein.

[00122]      Unless otherwise stated, structures depicted herein are also meant to include all
isomeric (e.g., enantiomeric, diastereomeric, and geometric (or conformational)) forms of the
structure; for example, the R and S configurations for each asymmetric center, Z and E
double bond isomers, and Z and E conformational isomers. Therefore, single stereochemical
isomers as well as enantiomeric, diastereomeric, and geometric (or conformational) mixtures
of the present compounds are within the scope of the invention. Unless otherwise stated, all
tautomeric forms of the compounds of the invention are within the scope of the invention.
Additionally, unless otherwise stated, structures depicted herein are also meant to include
compounds that differ only in the presence of one or more isotopically enriched atoms. For
example, compounds having the present structures including the replacement of hydrogen by
                                                                     14
deuterium or tritium, or the replacement of a carbon by a    1C-  or   C-enriched carbon are
within the scope of this invention. Such compounds are useful, for example, as analytical
tools, as probes in biological assays, or as therapeutic agents in accordance with the present
invention.
 [00123]     The term pharmaceuticallyy acceptable salt" means either an acid addition salt or
a basic addition salt which is compatible with the treatment of patients.
 [001241     In some embodiments, exemplary inorganic acids which form suitable salts
include, but are not limited thereto, hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric and phosphoric acid
and acid metal salts such as sodium monohydrogen orthophosphate and potassium hydrogen
sulfate. Illustrative organic acids which form suitable salts include the mono-, di- and
tricarboxylic acids. Illustrative of such acids are, for example, acetic, trifluoroacetic acid

 sulfonic acids such as methanesulfonic acid and 2-hydroxyethanesulfonic acid. Either the
mono- or di-acid salts can be formed, and such salts can exist in either a hydrated, solvated or
 substantially anhydrous form. In general, the acid addition salts of these compounds are
more soluble in water and various hydrophilic organic solvents, and generally demonstrate
higher melting points in comparison to their free base forms. Other non-pharmaceutically

                                               - 25
acceptable salts e.g. oxalates may be used for example in the isolation of compounds of
Formula I for laboratory use, or for subsequent conversion to a pharmaceutically acceptable
acid addition salt.
[00125]      A "pharmaceutically acceptable basic addition salt" is any non-toxic organic or
inorganic base addition salt of the acid compounds represented by Formula I or any of its
intermediates. Illustrative inorganic bases which form suitable'salts include, but are not
limited thereto, lithium, sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium or barium hydroxides.
Illustrative organic bases which form suitable salts include aliphatic, alicyclic or aromatic
organic amines such as methylamine, trimethyl amine and picoline or ammonia. The
selection of the appropriate salt may be important so that an ester functionality, if any,
elsewhere in the molecule is not hydrolyzed. The selection criteria for the appropriate salt
will be known to one skilled in the art.
[001261      Acid addition salts of the compounds of Formula I are most suitably formed from
pharmaceutically acceptable acids, and include for example those formed with inorganic
acids e.g. hydrochloric, sulphuric or phosphoric acids and organic acids e.g. succinic, maleic,
acetic, trifluoroacetic or fumaric acid. Other non-pharmaceutically acceptable salts e.g.
oxalates may be used for example in the isolation of compounds of Formula I for laboratory
use, or for subsequent conversion to a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt. Also
included within the scope of the invention are base addition salts (such as sodium, potassium
and ammonium salts), solvates and hydrates of compounds of the invention. The conversion
of a given compound salt to a desired compound salt is achieved by applying standard
techniques, well known to one skilled in the art.
 [00127]      The term "stereoisomers" is a general term for all isomers of the individual
molecules that differ only in the orientation of their atoms in space. It includes mirror image
isomers (enantiomers), geometric (cis/trans) isomers and isomers of compounds with more
than one chiral centre that are not mirror images of one another (diastereomers).
 [001281      The term "treat" or "treating" means to alleviate symptoms, eliminate the
 causation of the symptoms either on a temporary or permanent basis, or to prevent or slow
the appearance of symptoms of the named disorder or condition.
 100129]      The term "therapeutically effective amount" means an amount of the compound
 which is effective in treating or lessening the severity of one or more symptoms of a disorder
 or condition.

NeoplasticDisorders
[00159]      A compound or composition described herein can be used to treat a neoplastic
disorder. A "neoplastic disorder" is a disease or disorder characterized by cells that have the
capacity for autonomous growth or replication, e.g., an abnormal state or condition
characterized by proliferative cell growth. Exemplary neoplastic disorders include:
carcinoma, sarcoma, metastatic disorders, e.g., tumors arising from prostate, brain, bone,
colon, lung, breast, ovarian, and liver origin, hematopoietic neoplastic disorders, e.g.,
leukemias, lymphomas, myeloma and other malignant plasma cell disorders, and metastatic
tumors. Prevalent cancers include: breast, prostate, colon, lung, liver, and pancreatic cancers.
Treatment with the compound can be in an amount effective to ameliorate at least one
symptom of the neoplastic disorder, e.g., reduced cell proliferation, reduced tumor mass, etc.
[001601      The disclosed methods are useful in the prevention and treatment of cancer,
including for example, solid tumors, soft tissue tumors, and metastases thereof, as well as in
familial cancer syndromes such as Li Fraumeni Syndrome, Familial Breast-Ovarian Cancer
(BRCA1 or BRAC2 mutations) Syndromes, and others. The disclosed methods are also
useful in treating non-solid cancers. Exemplary solid tumors include malignancies (e.g.,
sarcomas, adenocarcinomas, and carcinomas) of the various organ systems, such as those of
lung, breast, lymphoid, gastrointestinal (e.g., colon), and genitourinary (e.g., renal, urothelial,
or testicular tumors) tracts, pharynx, prostate, and ovary. Exemplary adenocarcinomas
include colorectal cancers, renal-cell carcinoma, liver cancer, non-small cell carcinoma of the
lung, and cancer of the small intestine.

[001631      Metastases of the aforementioned cancers can also be treated or prevented in
accordance with the methods described herein.
Combination therapies
[00164]      In some embodiments, a compound described herein is administered together with
an additional "second" therapeutic agent or treatment. The choice of second therapeutic
agent may be made from any agent that is typically used in a monotherapy to treat the
indicated disease or condition. As used herein, the term "administered together" and related
terms refers to the simultaneous or sequential administration of therapeutic agents in
accordance with this invention. For example, a compound of the present invention may be
administered with another therapeutic agent simultaneously or sequentially in separate unit
dosage forms or together in a single unit dosage form. Accordingly, the present invention
provides a single unit dosage form comprising a compound of formula I, an additional
therapeutic agent, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, adjuvant, or vehicle.
[00165]      In one embodiment of the invention, where a second therapeutic agent is
administered to a subject, the effective amount of the compound of this invention is less than
its effective amount would be where the second therapeutic agent is not administered. In
another embodiment, the effective amount of the second therapeutic agent is less than its
effective amount would be where the compound of this invention is not administered. In this
way, undesired side effects associated with high doses of either agent may be minimized.
Other potential advantages (including without limitation improved dosing regimens and/or
reduced drug cost) will be apparent to those of skill in the art. The additional agents may be
administered separately, as part of a multiple dose regimen, from the compounds of this
invention. Alternatively, those agents may be part of a single dosage form, mixed together
with the compounds of this invention in a single composition.
         Cancer Combination Therapies
 [00166]     In some embodiments, a compound described herein is administered together with
an additional cancer treatment. Exemplary additional cancer treatments include, for example:
chemotherapy, targeted therapies such as antibody therapies, kinase inhibitors,

                                               - 37
immunotherapy, and hormonal therapy, epigenetic therapy, proteosome inhibitors, and anti
angiogenic therapies. Examples of each of these treatments are provided below. As used
herein, the term "combination," "combined," and related terms refer to the simultaneous or
sequential administration of therapeutic agents in accordance with this invention. For
example, a compound of the present invention can be administered with another therapeutic
agent simultaneously or sequentially in separate unit dosage forms or together in a single unit
dosage form. Accordingly, the present invention provides a single unit dosage form
comprising a compound of the invention, an additional therapeutic agent, and a
pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, adjuvant, or vehicle.
[001671      The amount of both a compound of the invention and additional therapeutic agent
(in those compositions which comprise an additional therapeutic agent as described above)
that can be combined with the carrier materials to produce a single dosage form will vary
depending upon the host treated and the particular mode of administration. Preferably,
compositions of this invention should be formulated so that a dosage of between 0.01 - 100
mg/kg body weight/day of a compound of the invention can be administered.
         Chemotherapy
 [001681     In some embodiments, a compound described herein is administered with a
chemotherapy. Chemotherapy is the treatment of cancer with drugs that can destroy cancer
cells. "Chemotherapy" usually refers to cytotoxic drugs which affect rapidly dividing cells in
 general, in contrast with targeted therapy. Chemotherapy drugs interfere with cell division in
various possible ways, e.g., with the duplication of DNA or the separation of newly formed
 chromosomes. Most forms of chemotherapy target all rapidly dividing cells and are not
 specific for cancer cells, although some degree of specificity may come from the inability of
 many cancer cells to repair DNA damage, while normal cells generally can.
 [00169]     Examples of chemotherapeutic agents used in cancer therapy include, for
 example, antimetabolites (e.g., folic acid, purine, and pyrimidine derivatives) and alkylating
 agents (e.g., nitrogen mustards, nitrosoureas, platinum, alkyl sulfonates, hydrazines,
 triazenes, aziridines, spindle poison, cytotoxic agents, topoisomerase inhibitors and others).
 Exemplary agents include Aclarubicin, Actinomycin, Alitretinoin, Altretamine, Aminopterin,

other cytostatic or cytotoxic agents described herein.
[00170]     Because some drugs work better together than alone, two or more drugs are often
given at the same time. Often, two or more chemotherapy agents are used as combination
chemotherapy. In some embodiments, the chemotherapy agents (including combination
chemotherapy) can be used in combination with a compound described herein.
 Targetedtherapy
 [00171]     Targeted therapy constitutes the use of agents specific for the deregulated proteins
of cancer cells. Small molecule targeted therapy drugs are generally inhibitors of enzymatic
domains on mutated, overexpressed, or otherwise critical proteins within the cancer cell.
Prominent examples are the tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as Axitinib, Bosutinib, Cediranib,
desatinib, erolotinib, imatinib, gefitinib, lapatinib, Lestaurtinib, Nilotinib, Semaxanib,
 Sorafenib, Sunitinib, and Vandetanib, and also cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors such as
Alvocidib and Seliciclib. Monoclonal antibody therapy is another strategy in which the
therapeutic agent is an antibody which specifically binds to a protein on the surface of the
 cancer cells. Examples include the anti-HER2/neu antibody trastuzumab (Herceptin@)

                                                -39
typically used in breast cancer, and the anti-CD20 antibody rituximab and Tositumomab
typically used in a variety of B-cell malignancies. Other exemplary antibodies include
Cetuximab, Panitumumab, Trastuzumab, Alemtuzumab, Bevacizumab, Edrecolomab, and
Gemtuzumab. Exemplary fusion proteins include Aflibercept and Denileukin diftitox. In
some embodiments, the targeted therapy can be used in combination with a compound
described herein, e.g., Gleevec (Vignari and Wang 2001).
[001721      Targeted therapy can also involve small peptides as "homing devices" which can
bind to cell surface receptors or affected extracellular matrix surrounding the tumor.
Radionuclides which are attached to these peptides (e.g., RGDs) eventually kill the cancer
cell if the nuclide decays in the vicinity of the cell. An example of such therapy includes
BEXXAR@.
Angiogenesis
[001731      Compounds and methods described herein may be used to treat or prevent a
disease or disorder associated with angiogenesis. Diseases associated with angiogenesis
include cancer, cardiovascular disease and macular degeneration.
[001741      Angiogenesis is the physiological process involving the growth of new blood
vessels from pre-existing vessels. Angiogenesis is a normal and vital process in growth and
development, as well as in wound healing and in granulation tissue. However, it is also a
fundamental step in the transition of tumors from a dormant state to a malignant one.
Angiogenesis may be a target for combating diseases characterized by either poor
vascularisation or abnormal vasculature.
[001751      Application of specific compounds that may inhibit or induce the creation of new
blood vessels in the body may help combat such diseases. The presence of blood vessels
where there should be none may affect the mechanical properties of a tissue, increasing the
likelihood of failure. The absence of blood vessels in a repairing or otherwise metabolically
active tissue may inhibit repair or other essential functions. Several diseases, such as
ischemic chronic wounds, are the result of failure or insufficient blood vessel formation and
may be treated by a local expansion of blood vessels, thus bringing new nutrients to the site,
facilitating repair. Other diseases, such as age-related macular degeneration, may be created
by a local expansion of blood vessels, interfering with normal physiological processes.
 [001761     Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has been demonstrated to be a major
contributor to angiogenesis, increasing the number of capillaries in a given network.

                                                - 40
Upregulation of VEGF is a major component of the physiological response to exercise and its
role in angiogenesis is suspected to be a possible treatment in vascular injuries. In vitro
studies clearly demonstrate that VEGF is a potent stimulator of angiogenesis because, in the
presence of this growth factor, plated endothelial cells will proliferate and migrate, eventually
forming tube structures resembling capillaries.
[00177]      Tumors induce blood vessel growth (angiogenesis) by secreting various growth
factors (e.g., VEGF). Growth factors such as bFGF and VEGF can induce capillary growth
into the tumor, which some researchers suspect supply required nutrients, allowing for tumor
expansion.
[00178]      Angiogenesis represents an excellent therapeutic target for the treatment of
cardiovascular disease. It is a potent, physiological process that underlies the natural manner
in which our bodies respond to a diminution of blood supply to vital organs, namely the
production of new collateral vessels to overcome the ischemic insult.
[00179]      Overexpression of VEGF causes increased permeability in blood vessels in
addition to stimulating angiogenesis. In wet macular degeneration, VEGF causes proliferation
of capillaries into the retina. Since the increase in angiogenesis also causes edema, blood and
other retinal fluids leak into the retina, causing loss of vision.
[00180]      Anti-angiogenic therapy can include kinase inhibitors targeting vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) such as sunitinib, sorafenib, or monoclonal antibodies or
receptor "decoys" to VEGF or VEGF receptor including bevacizumab or VEGF-Trap, or
thalidomide or its analogs (lenalidomide, pomalidomide), or agents targeting non-VEGF
angiogenic targets such as fibroblast growth factor (FGF), angiopoietins, or angiostatin or
endostatin.
Epigenetics
[00181]      Compounds and methods described herein may be used to treat or prevent a
disease or disorder associated with epigenetics. Epigenetics is the study of heritable changes
in phenotype or gene expression caused by mechanisms other than changes in the underlying
DNA sequence. One example of epigenetic changes in eukaryotic biology is the process of
cellular differentiation. During morphogenesis, stem cells become the various cell lines of the
embryo which in turn become fully differentiated cells. In other words, a single fertilized egg
cell changes into the many cell types including neurons, muscle cells, epithelium, blood

                                                - 41
vessels etc. as it continues to divide. It does so by activating some genes while inhibiting
others.
[00182]      Epigenetic changes are preserved when cells divide. Most epigenetic changes only
occur within the course of one individual organism's lifetime, but, if a mutation in the DNA
has been caused in sperm or egg cell that results in fertilization, then some epigenetic changes
are inherited from one generation to the next. Specific epigenetic processes include
paramutation, bookmarking, imprinting, gene silencing, X chromosome inactivation, position
effect, reprogramming, transvection, maternal effects, the progress of carcinogenesis, many
effects of teratogens, regulation of histone modifications and heterochromatin, and technical
limitations affecting parthenogenesis and cloning.
[00183]      Exemplary diseases associated with epigenetics include ATR-syndrome, fragile
X-syndrome, ICF syndrome, Angelman's syndrome, Prader-Wills syndrome, BWS, Rett
syndrome, a-thalassaemia, cancer, leukemia, Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome and Coffin-Lowry
syndrome.
[00184]      The first human disease to be linked to epigenetics was cancer. Researchers found
that diseased tissue from patients with colorectal cancer had less DNA methylation than
normal tissue from the same patients. Because methylated genes are typically turned off, loss
of DNA methylation can cause abnormally high gene activation by altering the arrangement
of chromatin. On the other hand, too much methylation can undo the work of protective
tumor suppressor genes.
 [00185]     DNA methylation occurs at CpG sites, and a majority of CpG cytosines are
methylated in mammals. However, there are stretches of DNA near promoter regions that
have higher concentrations of CpG sites (known as CpG islands) that are free of methylation
in normal cells. These CpG islands become excessively methylated in cancer cells, thereby
causing genes that should not be silenced to turn off. This abnormality is the trademark
epigenetic change that occurs in tumors and happens early in the development of cancer.
Hypermethylation of CpG islands can cause tumors by shutting off tumor-suppressor genes.
In fact, these types of changes may be more common in human cancer than DNA sequence
mutations.
 [001861     Furthermore, although epigenetic changes do not alter the sequence of DNA, they
 can cause mutations. About half of the genes that cause familial or inherited forms of cancer
 are turned off by methylation. Most of these genes normally suppress tumor formation and
help repair DNA, including 06-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), MLH1

                                               - 42
cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2B (CDKN2B), and RASSF1A. For example,
hypermethylation of the promoter of MGAT causes the number of G-to-A mutations to
increase.
100187]     Hypermethylation can also lead to instability of microsatellites, which are
repeated sequences of DNA. Microsatellites are common in normal individuals, and they
usually consist of repeats of the dinucleotide CA. Too much methylation of the promoter of
the DNA repair gene MLH1 can make a microsatellite unstable and lengthen or shorten it.
Microsatellite instability has been linked to many cancers, including colorectal, endometrial,
ovarian, and gastric cancers.
[001881     Fragile X syndrome is the most frequently inherited mental disability, particularly
in males. Both sexes can be affected by this condition, but because males only have one X
chromosome, one fragile X will impact them more severely. Indeed, fragile X syndrome
occurs in approximately 1 in 4,000 males and 1 in 8,000 females. People with this syndrome
have severe intellectual disabilities, delayed verbal development, and "autistic-like" behavior.
 [00189]    Fragile X syndrome gets its name from the way the part of the X chromosome that
contains the gene abnormality looks under a microscope; it usually appears as if it is hanging
by a thread and easily breakable. The syndrome is caused by an abnormality in the FMR1
(fragile X mental retardation 1) gene. People who do not have fragile X syndrome have 6 to
50 repeats of the trinucleotide CGG in their FMR] gene. However, individuals with over 200
repeats have a full mutation, and they usually show symptoms of the syndrome. Too many
CGGs cause the CpG islands at the promoter region of the FMR1 gene to become
methylated; normally, they are not. This methylation turns the gene off, stopping the FMR]
gene from producing an important protein called fragile X mental retardation protein. Loss of
this specific protein causes fragile X syndrome. Although a lot of attention has been given to
the CGG expansion mutation as the cause of fragile X, the epigenetic change associated with
FMR1 methylation is the real syndrome culprit.
 [001901     Fragile X syndrome is not the only disorder associated with mental retardation
that involves epigenetic changes. Other such conditions include Rubenstein-Taybi, Coffin
 Lowry, Prader-Willi, Angelman, Beckwith-Wiedemann, ATR-X, and Rett syndromes.
 [001911     Epigenetic therapies include inhibitors of enzymes controlling epigenetic
 modifications, specifically DNA methyltransferases and histone deacetylases, which have
 shown promising anti-tumorigenic effects for some malignancies, as well as antisense
 oligonucleotides and siRNA.

Immunotherapy
[001921      In some embodiments, a compound described herein is administered with an
immunotherapy. Cancer immunotherapy refers to a diverse set of therapeutic strategies
designed to induce the patient's own immune system to fight the tumor. Contemporary
methods for generating an immune response against tumors include intravesicular BCG
immunotherapy for superficial bladder cancer, prostate cancer vaccine Provenge, and use of
interferons and other cytokines to induce an immune response in renal cell carcinoma and
melanoma patients.
 100193]     Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation can be considered a form of
immunotherapy, since the donor's immune cells will often attack the tumor in a graft-versus
tumor effect. In some embodiments, the immunotherapy agents can be used in combination
with a compound described herein.
Hormonal therapy
 [001941     In some embodiments, a compound described herein is administered with a
hormonal therapy. The growth of some cancers can be inhibited by providing or blocking
certain hormones. Common examples of hormone-sensitive tumors include certain types of
breast and prostate cancers, as well as certain types of leukemia which respond to certain
retinoids/retinoic acids. Removing or blocking estrogen or testosterone is often an important
 additional treatment. In certain cancers, administration of hormone agonists, such as
progestogens may be therapeutically beneficial. In some embodiments, the hormonal therapy
 agents can be used in combination with a compound described herein.
 [001951     Hormonal therapy agents include the administration of hormone agonists or
hormone antagonists and include retinoids/retinoic acid, compounds that inhibit estrogen or
testosterone, as well as administration of progestogens.

 gravis, transplant rejection, endotoxin shock, sepsis, psoriasis, eczema, dermatitis, multiple
 sclerosis, autoimmune thyroiditis, uveitis, systemic lupus erythematosis, Addison's disease,
 autoimmune polyglandular disease (also known as autoimmune polyglandular syndrome),
 and Grave's disease.

Neurodegenerativedisease
[002111     Neurodegeneration is the umbrella term for the progressive loss of structure or
function of neurons, including death of neurons. Many neurodegenerative diseases including
Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, and Huntington's occur as a result of neurodegenerative processes.
As research progresses, many similarities appear which relate these diseases to one another
on a sub-cellular level. Discovering these similarities offers hope for therapeutic advances
that could ameliorate many diseases simultaneously. There are many parallels between
different neurodegenerative disorders including atypical protein assemblies as well as
induced cell death.
[002121     Alzheimer's disease is characterized by loss of neurons and synapses in the
cerebral cortex and certain subcortical regions. This loss results in gross atrophy of the
affected regions, including degeneration in the temporal lobe and parietal lobe, and parts of
the frontal cortex and cingulate gyrus.
 [002131    Huntington's disease causes astrogliosis and loss of medium spiny neurons. Areas
of the brain are affected according to their structure and the types of neurons they contain,
reducing in size as they cumulatively lose cells. The areas affected are mainly in the striatum,
but also the frontal and temporal cortices. The striatum's subthalamic nuclei send control
signals to the globus pallidus, which initiates and modulates motion. The weaker signals from
subthalamic nuclei thus cause reduced initiation and modulation of movement, resulting in
the characteristic movements of the disorder. Exemplary treatments for Huntington's disease
include tetrabenazine, neuroleptics, benzodiazepines, amantadine, remacemide, valproic acid,
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), mirtazapine and antipsychotics.
 [00214]     The mechanism by which the brain cells in Parkinson's are lost may consist of an
abnormal accumulation of the protein alpha-synuclein bound to ubiquitin in the damaged

                                              -50
cells. The alpha-synuclein-ubiquitin complex cannot be directed to the proteosome. This
protein accumulation forms proteinaceous cytoplasmic inclusions called Lewy bodies. The
latest research on pathogenesis of disease has shown that the death of dopaminergic neurons
by alpha-synuclein is due to a defect in the machinery that transports proteins between two
major cellular organelles -   the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi apparatus. Certain
proteins like Rab 1 may reverse this defect caused by alpha-synuclein in animal models.
Exemplary Parkinson's disease therapies include levodopa, dopamine agonists such as
include bromocriptine, pergolide, pramipexole, ropinirole, piribedil, cabergoline,
apomorphine and lisuride, dopa decarboxylate inhibitors, MAO-B inhibitors such as
selegilene and rasagilene, anticholinergics and amantadine.
[00215]      Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS/Lou Gehrig's Disease) is a disease in which
motor neurons are selectively targeted for degeneration. Exemplary ALS therapies include
riluzole, baclofen, diazepam, trihexyphenidyl and amitriptyline.
[00216]      Other exemplary neurodegenerative therapeutics include antisense
oligonucleotides and stem cells.
Wound Healing
1002171      Wounds are a type of condition characterized by cell or tissue damage. Wound
healing is a dynamic pathway that optimally leads to restoration of tissue integrity and
function. The wound healing process consists of three overlapping phases. The first phase is
an inflammatory phase, which is characterized by homeostasis, platelet aggregation and
degranulation. Platelets as the first response, release multiple growth factors to recruit
immune cells, epithelial cells, and endothelial cells. The inflammatory phase typically occurs
over days 0-5. The second stage of wound healing is the proliferative phase during which
macrophages and granulocytes invade the wound. Infiltrating fibroblasts begin to produce
collagen. The principle characteristics of this phase are epithelialization, angiogenesis,
granulation tissue formation and collagen production. The proliferative phase typically
occurs over days 3-14. The third phase is the remodeling phase where matrix formation
occurs. The fibroblasts, epithelial cells, and endothelial cells continue to produce collagen
and collagenase as well as matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) for remodeling. Collagen
crosslinking takes place and the wound undergoes contraction. The remodeling phase
typically occurs from day 7 to one year.

healing (e.g., promoting or accelerating wound closure and/or wound healing, mitigating scar
fibrosis of the tissue of and/or around the wound, inhibiting apoptosis of cells surrounding or
proximate to the wound). Thus, in certain embodiments, the present invention provides a
method for promoting wound healing in a subject, comprising administering to the subject a
compound (e.g., a CRM1 inhibitor), or pharmaceutically acceptable salt or composition
thereof. The method need not achieve complete healing or closure of the wound; it is
sufficient for the method to promote any degree of wound closure. In this respect, the
method can be employed alone or as an adjunct to other methods for healing wounded tissue.
[00219]      The compounds and compositions described herein can be used to treat wounds
during the inflammatory (or early) phase, during the proliferative (or middle) wound healing
phase, and/or during the remodeling (or late) wound healing phase.
[002201      In some embodiments, the subject in need of wound healing is a human or an
animal, for example, a horse, a pig, or a rodent, such as a mouse.
[00221]      In some embodiments, the compounds and compositions described herein useful
for wound healing are administered topically, for example, proximate to the wound site, or
systemically.
1002221      More specifically, the compound or composition described herein can be
administered (optionally in combination with other agents) to the wound site by coating the
wound or applying a bandage, packing material, stitches, etc., that are coated or treated with
the compound or composition described herein. As such, the compounds and compositions
described herein can be formulated for topical administration to treat surface wounds. Topical
formulations include those for delivery via the mouth (buccal) and to the skin such that a
layer of skin (i.e., the epidermis, dermis, and/or subcutaneous layer) is contacted with the
compound or composition described herein. Topical delivery systems may be used to
administer topical formulations of the compounds and compositions described herein.
 [00223]     Alternatively, the compounds and compositions described herein can be
administered at or near the wound site by, for example, injection of a solution, injection of an
extended release formulation, or introduction of a biodegradable implant comprising the
compound or composition described herein.
 [00224]     The compounds and compositions described herein can be used to treat acute
wounds or chronic wounds. A chronic wound results when the normal reparative process is
interrupted. Chronic wounds can develop from acute injuries as a result of unrecognized

                                               - 52
persistent infections or inadequate primary treatment. In most cases however, chronic lesions
are the end stage of progressive tissue breakdown owing to venous, arterial, or metabolic
vascular disease, pressure sores, radiation damage, or tumors.
[00225]      In chronic wounds, healing does not occur for a variety of reasons, including
improper circulation in diabetic ulcers, significant necrosis, such as in bums, and infections.
In these chronic wounds, viability or the recovery phase is often the rate-limiting step. The
cells are no longer viable and thus initial recovery phase is prolonged by unfavorable wound
bed environment.
[00226]      Chronic wounds include, but are not limited to the following: chronic ischemic
skin lesions; scleroderma ulcers; arterial ulcers; diabetic foot ulcers; pressure ulcers; venous
ulcers; non-healing lower extremity wounds; ulcers due to inflammatory conditions; and/or
long-standing wounds.
[002271      In a particular embodiment, the compounds and compositions described herein
can be used for diabetic wound healing or accelerating healing of leg and foot ulcers
secondary to diabetes or ischemia in a subject.
[002281      In one embodiment, the wound is a surface wound. In another embodiment, the
wound is a surgical wound (e.g., abdominal or gastrointestinal surgical wound). In a further
embodiment, the wound is a burn. In yet another embodiment, the wound is the result of
radiation exposure.
 [00229]     The compounds and compositions described herein can also be used for diabetic
wound healing, gastrointestinal wound healing, or healing of an adhesion due, for example, to
an operation.
 [002301     The compounds and compositions described herein can also be used to heal
wounds that are secondary to another disease. For example, in inflammatory skin diseases,
such as psoriasis and dermatitis, there are numerous incidents of skin lesions that are
secondary to the disease, and are caused by deep cracking of the skin, or scratching of the
 skin. The compounds and compositions described herein can be used to heal wounds that are
 secondary to these diseases, for example, inflammatory skin diseases, such as psoriasis and
 dermatitis.
 [00231]     In a further embodiment, the wound is an internal wound. In a specific aspect, the
 internal wound is a chronic wound. In another specific aspect, the wound is a vascular
wound. In yet another specific aspect, the internal wound is an ulcer.

                                               - 53
[00232]     Examples of wounds include, but are not limited to, abrasions, avulsions, blowing
wounds (i.e., open pneumothorax), burn wounds, contusions, gunshot wounds, incised
wounds, open wounds, penetrating wounds, perforating wounds, puncture wounds, s6ton
wounds, stab wounds, surgical wounds, subcutaneous wounds, diabetic lesions, or tangential
wounds. Additional examples of wounds that can be treated by the compounds and
compositions described herein include acute conditions or wounds, such as thermal burns,
chemical burns, radiation burns, burns caused by excess exposure to ultraviolet radiation
(e.g., sunburn); damage to bodily tissues, such as the perineum as a result of labor and
childbirth; injuries sustained during medical procedures, such as episiotomies; trauma
induced injuries including cuts, incisions, excoriations; injuries sustained from accidents;
post-surgical injuries, as well as chronic conditions, such as pressure sores, bedsores,
conditions related to diabetes and poor circulation, and all types of acne. In addition, the
wound can include dermatitis, such as impetigo, intertrigo, folliculitis and eczema, wounds
following dental surgery; periodontal disease; wounds following trauma; and tumor
associated wounds. Yet other examples of wounds include animal bites, arterial disease,
insect stings and bites, bone infections, compromised skin/muscle grafts, gangrene, skin tears
or lacerations, skin aging, surgical incisions, including slow or non-healing surgical wounds,
intracerebral hemorrhage, aneurysm, dermal asthenia, and post-operation infections.
 [00233]    In preferred embodiments, the wound is selected from the group consisting of a
burn wound, an incised wound, an open wound, a surgical or post surgical wound, a diabetic
lesion, a thermal burn, a chemical burn, a radiation burn, a pressure sore, a bedsore, and a
 condition related to diabetes or poor circulation.
 [002341     The present disclosure also relates to methods and compositions of reducing scar
 formation during wound healing in a subject. The compounds and compositions described
 herein can be administered directly to the wound or to cells proximate the wound at an
 amount effective to reduce scar formation in and/or around the wound.
 [002351     The wound can include any injury to any portion of the body of a subject.
 According to embodiments, methods are provided to ameliorate, reduce, or decrease the
 formation of scars in a subject that has suffered a bum injury. According to preferred
 embodiments, methods are provided to treat, reduce the occurrence of, or reduce the
 probability of developing hypertrophic scars in a subject that has suffered an acute or chronic
 wound or injury.

Other disorders
[00236]      Compounds and compositions described herein may also be used to treat disorders
of abnormal tissue growth and fibrosis including dilative cardiomyopathy, hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy, restrictive cardiomyopathy, pulmonary fibrosis, hepatic fibrosis,
glomerulonephritis, and other renal disorders.
CombinationRadiation Therapy
[00237]      Compounds and compositions described herein are useful as radiosensitizers.
Therefore, compounds and compositions described herein can be administered in
combination with radiation therapy. Radiation therapy is the medical use of high-energy
radiation (e.g., x-rays, gamma rays, charged particles) to shrink tumors and kill malignant
cells, and is generally used as part of cancer treatment. Radiation therapy kills malignant
cells by damaging their DNA.
[002381      Radiation therapy can be delivered to a patient in several ways. For example,
radiation can be delivered from an external source, such as a machine outside the patient's
body, as in external beam radiation therapy. External beam radiation therapy for the
treatment of cancer uses a radiation source that is external to the patient, typically either a
radioisotope, such as   60Co, 13 7Cs, or a high energy x-ray source, such as a linear accelerator.
The external source produces a collimated beam directed into the patient to the tumor site.
External-source radiation therapy avoids some of the problems of internal-source radiation
therapy, but it undesirably and necessarily irradiates a significant volume of non-tumorous or
healthy tissue in the path of the radiation beam along with the tumorous tissue.
 [00239]         The adverse effect of irradiating of healthy tissue can be reduced, while
maintaining a given dose of radiation in the tumorous tissue, by projecting the external
radiation beam into the patient at a variety of "gantry" angles with the beams converging on
the tumor site. The particular volume elements of healthy tissue, along the path of the
radiation beam, change, reducing the total dose to each such element of healthy tissue during
the entire treatment.
 [00240]         The irradiation of healthy tissue also can be reduced by tightly collimating the
radiation beam to the general cross section of the tumor taken perpendicular to the axis of the
radiation beam. Numerous systems exist for producing such a circumferential collimation,
some of which use multiple sliding shutters which, piecewise, can generate a radio-opaque
mask of arbitrary outline.

                                                - 55
[00241]      For administration of external beam radiation, the amount can be at least about 1
Gray (Gy) fractions at least once every other day to a treatment volume. In a particular
embodiment, the radiation is administered in at least about 2 Gray (Gy) fractions at least once
per day to a treatment volume. In another particular embodiment, the radiation is
administered in at least about 2 Gray (Gy) fractions at least once per day to a treatment
volume for five consecutive days per week. In another particular embodiment, radiation is
administered in 10 Gy fractions every other day, three times per week to a treatment volume.
In another particular embodiment, a total of at least about 20 Gy is administered to a patient
in need thereof. In another particular embodiment, at least about 30 Gy is administered to a
patient in need thereof. In another particular embodiment, at least about 40 Gy is
administered to a patient in need thereof.
[002421           Typically, the patient receives external beam therapy four or five times a
week. An entire course of treatment usually lasts from one to seven weeks depending on the
type of cancer and the goal of treatment. For example, a patient can receive a dose of 2
Gy/day over 30 days.
 [00243]     Internal radiation therapy is localized radiation therapy, meaning the radiation
source is placed at the site of the tumor or affected area. Internal radiation therapy can be
delivered by placing a radiation source inside or next to the area requiring treatment. Internal
radiation therapy is also called brachytherapy. Brachytherapy includes intercavitary
treatment and interstitial treatment. In intracavitary treatment, containers that hold
radioactive sources are put in or near the tumor. The sources are put into the body cavities.
In interstitial treatment, the radioactive sources alone are put into the tumor. These
radioactive sources can stay in the patient permanently. Typically, the radioactive sources
are removed from the patient after several days. The radioactive sources are in containers.
 [00244]     There are a number of methods for administration of a radiopharmaceutical agent.
For example, the radiopharmaceutical agent can be administered by targeted delivery or by
systemic delivery of targeted radioactive conjugates, such as a radiolabeled antibody, a
radiolabeled peptide and a liposome delivery system. In one particular embodiment of
targeted delivery, the radiolabelled pharmaceutical agent can be a radiolabelled antibody.
 See, for example, Ballangrud A. M., et al. Cancer Res., 2001; 61:2008-2014 and Goldenber,
D.M. J. Nucl. Med., 2002; 43(5):693-713, the contents of which are incorporated by
reference herein.

                                               - 56
[00245]     In another particular embodiment of targeted delivery, the radiopharmaceutical
agent can be administered in the form of liposome delivery systems, such as small
unilamellar vesicles, large unilamellar vesicles and multilamellar vesicles. Liposomes can be
formed from a variety of phospholipids, such as cholesterol, stearylamine or
phosphatidylcholines. See, for example, Emfietzoglou D, Kostarelos K, Sgouros G. An
analytical dosimetry study for the use of radionuclide-liposome conjugates in internal
radiotherapy. J Nucl Med 2001; 42:499-504, the contents of which are incorporated by
reference herein.
100246]     In yet another particular embodiment of targeted delivery, the radiolabeled
pharmaceutical agent can be a radiolabeled peptide. See, for example, Weiner RE, Thakur
ML. Radiolabeled peptides in the diagnosis and therapy of oncological diseases. Appl
Radiat Isot 2002 Nov;57(5):749-63, the contents of which are incorporated by reference
herein.
[00247]     In addition to targeted delivery, bracytherapy can be used to deliver the
radiopharmaceutical agent to the target site. Brachytherapy is a technique that puts the
radiation sources as close as possible to the tumor site. Often the source is inserted directly
into the tumor. The radioactive sources can be in the form of wires, seeds or rods. Generally,
cesium, iridium or iodine are used.
1002481     Systemic radiation therapy is another type of radiation therapy and involves the
use of radioactive substances in the blood. Systemic radiation therapy is a form of targeted
therapy. In systemic radiation therapy, a patient typically ingests or receives an injection of a
radioactive substance, such as radioactive iodine or a radioactive substance bound to a
monoclonal antibody.
[002491     A "radiopharmaceutical agent," as defined herein, refers to a pharmaceutical agent
which contains at least one radiation-emitting radioisotope. Radiopharmaceutical agents are
routinely used in nuclear medicine for the diagnosis and/or therapy of various diseases. The
radiolabelled pharmaceutical agent, for example, a radiolabelled antibody, contains a
radioisotope (RI) which serves as the radiation source. As contemplated herein, the term
"radioisotope" includes metallic and non-metallic radioisotopes. The radioisotope is chosen
based on the medical application of the radiolabeled pharmaceutical agents. When the
radioisotope is a metallic radioisotope, a chelator is typically employed to bind the metallic
radioisotope to the rest of the molecule. When the radioisotope is a non-metallic radioisotope,

                                               - 57
the non-metallic radioisotope is typically linked directly, or via a linker, to the rest of the
molecule.
[00250]     As used herein, a "metallic radioisotope" is any suitable metallic radioisotope
useful in a therapeutic or diagnostic procedure in vivo or in vitro. Suitable metallic
radioisotopes include, but are not limited to: Actinium-225, Antimony-124, Antimony-125,

 [00251]     As used herein, a "non-metallic radioisotope" is any suitable nonmetallic
radioisotope (non-metallic radioisotope) useful in a therapeutic or diagnostic procedure in
vivo or in vitro. Suitable non-metallic radioisotopes include, but are not limited to: Iodine
 131, Iodine-125, Iodine-123, Phosphorus-32, Astatine-21 1, Fluorine-18, Carbon-1i, Oxygen
 15, Bromine-76, and Nitrogen- 13.
 [00252]     Identifying the most appropriate isotope for radiotherapy requires weighing a
variety of factors. These include tumor uptake and retention, blood clearance, rate of
radiation delivery, half-life and specific activity of the radioisotope, and the feasibility of
large-scale production of the radioisotope in an economical fashion. The key point for a
therapeutic radiopharmaceutical is to deliver the requisite amount of radiation dose to the

                                                 - 58
tumor cells and to achieve a cytotoxic or tumoricidal effect while not causing unmanageable
side-effects.
[00253]      It is preferred that the physical half-life of the therapeutic radioisotope be similar
to the biological half-life of the radiopharmaceutical at the tumor site. For example, if the
half-life of the radioisotope is too short, much of the decay will have occurred before the
radiopharmaceutical has reached maximum target/background ratio. On the other hand, too
long a half-life could cause unnecessary radiation dose to normal tissues. Ideally, the
radioisotope should have a long enough half-life to attain a minimum dose rate and to
irradiate all the cells during the most radiation sensitive phases of the cell cycle. In addition,
the half-life of a radioisotope has to be long enough to allow adequate time for
manufacturing, release, and transportation.
[00254]      Other practical considerations in selecting a radioisotope for a given application in
tumor therapy are availability and quality. The purity has to be sufficient and reproducible, as
trace amounts of impurities can affect the radiolabeling and radiochemical purity of the
radiopharmaceutical.
 [00255]     The target receptor sites in tumors are typically limited in number. As such, it is
preferred that the radioisotope have high specific activity. The specific activity depends
primarily on the production method. Trace metal contaminants must be minimized as they
often compete with the radioisotope for the chelator and their metal complexes compete for
receptor binding with the radiolabeled chelated agent.
 [00256]     The type of radiation that is suitable for use in the methods of the present
invention can vary. For example, radiation can be electromagnetic or particulate in nature.
Electromagnetic radiation useful in the practice of this invention includes, but is not limited
to, x-rays and gamma rays. Particulate radiation useful in the practice of this invention
includes, but is not limited to, electron beams (beta particles), protons beams, neutron beams,
alpha particles, and negative pi mesons. The radiation can be delivered using conventional
radiological treatment apparatus and methods, and by intraoperative and stereotactic methods.
Additional discussion regarding radiation treatments suitable for use in the practice of this
invention can be found throughout Steven A. Leibel et al., Textbook of Radiation Oncology
 (1998) (publ. W. B. Saunders Company), and particularly in Chapters 13 and 14. Radiation
 can also be delivered by other methods such as targeted delivery, for example by radioactive
 "seeds," or by systemic delivery of targeted radioactive conjugates. J. Padawer et al.,
 Combined Treatment with Radioestradiol lucanthone in Mouse C3HBA Mammary

Adenocarcinoma and with Estradiol lucanthone in an Estrogen Bioassay, Int. J. Radiat.
Oncol. Biol. Phys. 7:347-357 (1981). Other radiation delivery methods can be used in the
practice of this invention.
[00257]     For tumor therapy, both o and P-particle emitters have been investigated. Alpha
particles are particularly good cytotoxic agents because they dissipate a large amount of
energy within one or two cell diameters. The p-particle emitters have relatively long
penetration range (2-12 mm in the tissue) depending on the energy level. The long-range
penetration is particularly important for solid tumors that have heterogeneous blood flow
and/or receptor expression. The p-particle emitters yield a more homogeneous dose
distribution even when they are heterogeneously distributed within the target tissue.
[002581     In a particular embodiment, therapeutically effective amounts of the compounds
and compositions described herein are administered in combination with a therapeutically
effective amount of radiation therapy to treat cancer (e.g., lung cancer, such as non-small cell
lung cancer).    The amount of radiation necessary can be determined by one of skill in the art
based on known doses for a particular type of cancer. See, for example, Cancer Medicine 5th
ed., Edited by R.C. Bast et al., July 2000, BC Decker.

understanding can be obtained by reference to the following specific Examples. These
Examples are described solely for purposes of illustration and are not intended to limit the
scope of the invention. Changes in form and substitution of equivalents are contemplated as

[00260]     Throughout the following description of such processes it is to be understood that,
where appropriate, suitable protecting groups will be added to, and subsequently removed
from, the various reactants and intermediates in a manner that will be readily understood by
one skilled in the art of organic synthesis. Conventional procedures for using such protecting
groups as well as examples of suitable protecting groups are described, for example, in
"Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis", T.W. Green, P.G.M. Wuts, Wiley-Interscience,
New York, (1999). It is also to be understood that a transformation of a group or substituent
into another group or substituent by chemical manipulation can be conducted on any
intermediate or final product on the synthetic path toward the final product, in which the
possible type of transformation is limited only by inherent incompatibility of other
functionalities carried by the molecule at that stage to the conditions or reagents employed in
the transformation. Such inherent incompatibilities, and ways to circumvent them by
carrying out appropriate transformations and synthetic steps in a suitable order, will be
readily understood to the one skilled in the art of organic synthesis. Examples of
transformations are given below, and it is to be understood that the described transformations
are not limited only to the generic groups or substituents for which the transformations are
exemplified. References and descriptions on other suitable transformations are given in
"Comprehensive Organic Transformations - A Guide to Functional Group Preparations" R.
C. Larock, VHC Publishers, Inc. (1989). References and descriptions of other suitable
reactions are described in textbooks of organic chemistry, for example, "Advanced Organic

Inhibition of Nuclear Export
[00299]       The inhibition of CRM1 mediated nuclear export by compounds of the invention
was determined. The results are shown in Table 2. The inhibitory activity of compounds for
the CRM1 protein was determined in the RevGFP assay. Compounds of the invention are
active in Rev-GFP assay with IC5 0 < 10 VtM with the most preferred compounds having
activities with IC 5 0 values of 1 VtM.
 [003001      Experimental protocol: Rev is a protein from human immunodeficiency virus type
 1 (HIV-1) and contains a nuclear export signal (NES) in its C-terminal domain and a nuclear
localization signal (NLS) in its N-terminal domain. Nuclear export of Rev protein is
dependent on the classical NES/ CRM1 pathway (Neville et al, 1997, Kau et al, 2003).
Nuclear accumulation of Rev is observed in cells treated with specific inhibitors of CRMI1,
such as LMB (Kau et al, 2003). In this assay, U2OS-RevGFP cells are seeded onto clear
bottom, black, 384-well plates the day before the experiment. Compounds are serially diluted
 1:2 starting from 40 iM in a separate 384-well plate in DMEM, and then transferred onto
cells. Cells are incubated with compound for ~1 hr before fixation with 3.7% formaldehyde

                                             - 81
and nuclei staining with Hoechst 33258. The amount of GFP in cell nuclei was measured and
compound IC50s were determined (Kau et al, 2003).
MTT Cell ProliferationAssay
[00301]     The CellTiter 96@ AQueous One Solution cell proliferation assay (Promega) was
used on MM1.S, Jurkat and HCT-1 16 cells to study the cytotoxic and cytostatic properties of
the compounds. The assay is based on the cleavage of the tetrazolium salt, MTS, in the
presence of an electron-coupling reagent PES (phenazine ethosulfate). The MTS tetrazolium
compound is bioreduced by cells into a colored formazan product that is soluble in tissue
culture medium. This conversion is presumably accomplished by NADPH or NADH
produced by dehydrogenase enzymes in metabolically active cells. Assays are performed by
adding a small amount of the CellTiter 96@ AQueous One solution reagent directly to culture
wells, incubating for 1-4 hours and then recording the absorbance at 490nm with a 96-well
plate reader. The absorbance revealed directly correlates to the cell number and their
metabolic activity. The cells were seeded at 5x10 3 to 1.5x10 4 cells (depending on cell type) in
each well of 96-well plate in 100 tL of fresh culture medium and adherent cells were allowed
to attach for overnight. The stock solutions of the compounds were diluted in cell culture
medium to obtain eight concentrations of each drug, ranging from 1 nM to 30 tM and DMSO
at less than 1% v/v was used as a negative control. After 72 h of treatment 20pl of CellTiter
96@ AQueous reagent was added into each well of the 96-well assay plates and the plate was
incubate at 37'C for 1-4 hours in a humidified, 5% C02 atmosphere. Then the absorbance of
each well was recorded at 490nm by using a 96-well plate reader. In most cases the assay
was performed in triplicates and the results were presented as half maximal inhibitory
concentration (IC 5 o) described below. Optical density versus compound concentration was
plotted and analyzed using non linear regression equations (Excel Fit) and the IC 50 for each
compound was calculated. The results are shown in Table 2.
[00302      Determinationof Pharmacokinetics(PK) and Brain.PlasmaRatio Blood was
collected from mice (N=3) to contribute to the total of 10 time points (pre-dose, 5 min, 15
min, 30 min, 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours, 8 hours, 12 hours and 24 hours post dose). Mice were
bled on a rotating basis, each mouse contributing 3 time points to the blood collection. At the
designated time points, animals were anaesthetized under isoflurane, and approximately 110
[tL of blood per time point was collected via retro-orbital puncture into pre-cooled K 2EDTA
(anti-coagulant) tubes. Blood samples were put on wet ice and centrifuged (2000g, 5 min at 4

'C) to obtain plasma within 30 minutes of sample collection. All samples were stored frozen
at approximately -80 0C until analysis. Prior to analysis, samples were mixed with internal
standard (dexamethasone) in acetonitrile, vortexed, centrifuged, and supernatant was injected
for analysis. Concentration of compounds in plasma was determined using LC-MS-MS
instrumentation (API 4000, Triple Quadruple with electrospray ionization; Acuity Ultra
Performance Liquid Chromatography column C18, with MeOH and formic acid as organic
solvents). PK parameters including but not limited to Tmax, Cmax, tm/2 , AUCiat, AUCinf were
calculated using WinNonlin Professional 6.2 software package, non-compartmental
pharmacokinetic model NCA200.
[00303]     Brain to Plasma Ratio (B:P). A separate group of mice (N=3) were dosed (PO at
10 mg/kg unless otherwise indicated) and then sacrificed at the time of maximal plasma
concentration (estimatedTmax at 2 hours post-dose) where terminal plasma and brain were
collected. Brain tissue following collection was rinsed with cold saline, dried on filter paper,
weighed and snap-frozen by placing on dry ice. All samples were stored frozen at
approximately -80 C until analysis. At the time of analysis, brain tissue was homogenized
(homogenizing solution PBS, pH 7.4), mixed with internal standard (dexamethasone) in
acetonitrile, vortexed, centrifuged, and supernatant was injected for analysis of compound
concentration using LC-MS-MS methodology (API 4000, Triple Quadruple with electrospray
ionization; Acuity Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography column C18, with MeOH and
formic acid as organic solvents). Plasma samples were treated with the identical method
(except homogenization step) and concentration of compound in either matrix was calculated
based on the generated standard curves. The results are shown in Table 2.

[003041     The AUCef for compound X- 1 was below the limit of detection when dosed in
mice at 10 mg/kg po. When dosed at 5 mg/kg iv, compound X-1 showed minimal exposure,
as indicated by the low AUCinf of 209 hr-ng/mL. The brain to plasma ratio for compound X
 1 was not determined due to its negligible levels (below the quantitation limit) in the brain
when dosed po.
 100305]    The AUCfif for compound X-2 was calculated to be 68.3 hr-ng/mL when dosed in
rats at 10 mg/kg po. Such exposure levels are exceedingly low when compared to compound
X-3 and compounds of Formula I of the present invention. However, compound X-2 exhibits
a moderate brain to plasma ratio. The low AUCiJf coupled with a non-negligible brain to

                                                 - 84
plasma ratio suggests that compound X-2 can crosses the BBB despite the low exposure
levels. Applicants believe that Compound X-2 would have a significantly higher brain to
plasma ratio if its AUChf were increased.
[00306]      The AUCmf for compound X-3 was calculated to be 12300 hr-ng/mL when dosed
in rats at 10 mg/kg po, indicated good exposure. However, X-3 demonstrated a high B:P
ratio of 5.0.
 [003071     The compounds of Formula I, all show a high AUCf (>3500 hr-ng/mL) and a
relatively low B:P (<2.5). Generally, greater exposure levels of a therapeutic agent often
increase the likelihood of brain penetration. It is therefore surprising and unexpected that
compounds of formula I exhibit high AUCnf levels while relatively low brain to plasma
ratios.

Evaluation of the effects of Compound 2 on tumor growth in the Z-138 lymphoma cell line
grown as a xenograft in SCID mice
 [003081     Z-138 (ATCC # CRL-3001) mantle cell lymphoma cells were obtained from
ATCC. These cells were grown in IMEM medium supplemented with 10% horse serum, 1%
penicillin and streptomycin, and 2mM L-glutamine. Cells were sub-cultured by dilution at a
ratio of 1:5 to 1:10. Twenty-four (24) female CB- 17 SCID mice (Charles River Labs strain
code 236), aged 5 to 6 weeks were used. The SCID mice were inoculated in the left flank
with Z-138 cells in a volume of 0.2 mL, equivalent to 4 x 107 cells per mouse.
 [00309]     Treatment was initiated when the tumors reached a mean volume of 84.3 mm3 .
Mice were allocated to four (4) groups of eight (8) prior to the initiation of treatment based
on tumor volume such that mean tumor volume in each group was within the range of 77 to
 92 mm3 . Mice were treated with vehicle, standard of care drug/positive control drug

 [00310]      Animals were fed with Labdiet* 5001 rodent chow and sterile water ad libitum.
 Tumors were measured once every two days with micro-calipers, and tumor volume was
 calculated as (length x width x width)/2. All animals were weighed every day in order to
 assess possible differences in animal weight among treatment groups as an indication of
 possible toxicity resulting from the treatments. Animals with weight loss of more than 20%
 of their starting weight were euthanized. Mice with weight loss of more than 15% of their
 starting weight were not treated again until weight loss recovered to less than 5% of their
 starting weight. Any animals with a tumor volume of more than 1500 mm3 were euthanized.
 100311]      Dosing solutions were prepared fresh on each day of dosing. Compound 2 was
 supplied as a lyophilized powder containing 69.6 1% Compound 2 with the balance made up
 of Pluronic F-68 and PVP K29/32. This was prepared by dissolving the lyophilized powder
 in sterile water. Cyclophosphamide was dissolved at 8 mg/mL in sterile water for injection.
 All test articles were administered in a volume of 10 mL/kg body weight.
 [003121      Statistical differences between treatment groups were determined using Mann
 Whitney Rank Sum or ANOVA tests with a critical value of 0.05.
  [003131     FIG. 1 shows that all treatment groups showed statistically significant reductions
 in tumor growth relative to vehicle when evaluated by comparing the area under the growth
 curves using an ANOVA test for both tumor volume and percent tumor volume. These
 treatment groups showed significant tumor growth reductions at p<0.0001. Some weight loss
 was observed in the group treated with Compound 2 at 15 mg/kg and, although statistically
 significant, when compared to vehicle controls, severe weight loss was limited to a few
 animals.

  [00315]     The A549 cell line was derived from explant culture of alveolar carcinoma tissue
 from a 58-year-old Caucasian male.The cells were grown in Ham's F12-K tissue culture
 media with 10% fetal calf serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were routinely
 trypsinized and passaged 1:10. Thirty-two (32) female CB-17 SCID mice (Charles River

                                               -  86
Labs strain code 236), aged 5 to 6 weeks were used with a mean pre-treatment body weight
of 16.3 grams. Mice were divided into four (4) groups of eight (8) prior to the initiation of
treatment based on tumor volume. On the day of implantation, cells were washed in PBS,
trypsinized and resuspended in complete media to a density of 2 x 107 cells/mL prior to being
mixed with an equal volume of Matrigel. This mixture was then inoculated subcutaneously
into mice in a volume of 0.1 mL using a 23G needle.
 [00316]    Mice were treated with vehicle, standard of care drug/positive control drug
(cisplatin) or Compound 2, as shown in Table 4. Animal weights and condition were recorded
daily, and tumors were measured on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays with micro-calipers,
and tumor volume was calculated as (length x width x width)/2.

 [003171    Animals with weight loss of more than 20% of their starting weight were
euthanized. Mice with weight loss of more than 15% of their starting weight were not treated
again until weight loss recovered to less than 5% of their starting weight. Any animals with a
tumor volume of more than 1500 mm3 were euthanized.
 [00318]    Dosing solutions were prepared fresh on each day of dosing. Compound 2 was
supplied as a lyophilized powder containing 69.61% Compound 2with the balance made up
of Pluronic F-68 and PVP K29/32. This was prepared by dissolving the lyophilized powder
in sterile water. Cisplatin was dissolved at 5 mg/mL in DMSO and diluted 1:10 in sterile
water for injection. All test articles were administered in a volume of 0.1mL/10g body
weight.
 [00319]    Statistical differences between treatment groups were determined using Mann
Whitney Rank Sum or ANOVA tests with a critical value of 0.05.
 [00320]    The data for tumor volume change during the study are shown in FIG. 2. The
                                                                           3
mean tumor volume for the vehicle control group increased from 95 mm         on Day I to 1669
mm3 on Day 29. The group treated with cisplatin had a mean tumor volume of 104 mm3 on
Day 1, increasing to 1136 mm 3 on Day 29. Mice treated with Compound 2 at 10 mg/kg PO

                                                - 87
(Group 3) had a mean tumor volume of 101 mm3 on Day 1, which increased to 686 mm 3 by
Day 29. Mice treated with Compound 2 at 5 mg/kg PO (Group 6) had a mean tumor volume
of 101 mm 3 on Day 1, which increased to 1231 mm 3 by Day 29.
[00321]      Additional analyses of the tumor volume data were performed by calculating the
mean area under the curve (AUC) for each tumor and comparing the groups using a one-way
ANOVA test. This analysis indicated that there were statistically significant differences
between the vehicle control group and the group treated with Compound 2 at 10 mg/kg
(p=0.0005). It should be noted that there was that there was no statistically significant
reduction in tumor growth in the positive control group (cisplatin).
[00322]      Compound 2, administered orally, had an antitumor effect at both 5 mg/kg and 10
mg/kg doses in a dose dependent manner. However, it was only the 10 mg/kg group that
showed a statistically significant difference when compared to the vehicle treated group.
Evaluation of Compound 2 in the anti-collagenantibody induced mouse model of
rheumatoridarthritis(CAIA)
[00323]      Twenty-four (24) male Balb/c mice, aged 6 to 8 weeks were used. The weight
variation of animals at the time of treatment initiation did not exceed +20% of the mean
weight. Animals were randomly assigned to 3 groups that would receive vehicle,
dexamethasone or Compound 2. On study Day 0 (study commencement), all mice were
subjected to a 2 mg intravenous injection of ArthritoMAbTM antibody cocktail (MD
Biosciences #S1203001) followed by an intraperitoneal injection of LPS (100tg/mouse) on
study Day 3. Study animals were treated with 7.5 mg/kg Compound 2 or 4 mg/kg Compound
2 orally; 1 mg/kg dexamethasone intraperitoneally; or vehicle orally. Treatments were         .
administered once daily on days 4, 6, 8 and 10 for all groups, except where dosing vacations
applied. If an animal's weight dropped below 87% of its day 0 starting weight, the animal
was not dosed until it gained weight equivalent to 90% or more of day 0 weight.
 [00324]     Arthritis development, clinical signs and body weights were monitored in all mice
on study days 0, 3-8, 10 and 12. Observations included changes in skin, fur, eyes, mucous
membranes, occurrence of secretions and excretions (e.g., diarrhea) and autonomic activity
(e.g., lacrimation, salivation, piloerection, pupil size, unusual respiratory pattern). All paws
(front left and right, and rear left and right) of each animal were examined for signs of
arthritogenic responses prior to arthritis induction and test item or control item administration
on study Day 0 and subsequently on study Days 3-8, 10 and 12 (study termination). A rthritis

                                              - 88
reactions were scored and recorded according to a 0-4 scale in ascending order of severity, as
shown Table 5 below. Paw thickness was also measured using a dial caliper (Kroeplin,
Munich, Germany).

 [00325]     The dose administered was calculated based on the assumption that the animals
weighed, on average, 20g. A stock solution of dexamethasone was prepared in 100% ethanol
 and diluted to the appropriate concentration in PBS prior to use. Vehicle for the vehicle
 control group was prepared by dissolving 0.6g Pluronic and 0.6g PVP in 1OOmL distilled
 deionised water. The MAb stock solution (10 mg/mL) was supplied by MD Biosciences,
 Division of Morwell Diagnostics GmbH. LPS was diluted with PBS to achieve the
 appropriate concentration. Thorough vortexing was required just prior to its injection.
 Compound 2 was supplied as a lyophilized drug powder containing 70.71% Compound 2
 with the balance made up of Pluronic F-68 and PVP K29/32. A fixed volume of 200 IL was
 administered to each mouse.
 [00326]     Evaluation was primarily based on the mean values for arthritis scoring and paw
 thickness measurements. Where appropriate, analysis of the data by ANOVA with Tukey
 post hoc analysis was applied to determine significance of treatment effects.
 [00327]     FIGS. 3A and 3B show the results of the CAIA mouse model experiments.
 Clinical signs associated with LPS-administration developed in all groups following the LPS
 boost on day 3. Compared to vehicle treated mice, mice treated with 7.5 mg/kg or 4 mg/kg
 Compound 2 had significantly reduced total arthritis scores on days 5-12 and 6-12,
 respectively. Dexamethasone treatment significantly reduced total arthritis score compared to
 the vehicle group on days 6-12. Compared to vehicle treated mice, mice treated with 7.5

                                               -89
mg/kg or 4 mg/kg Compound 2 had significantly reduced rear paw arthritis scores on days 5
12. Dexamethasone treatment significantly reduced rear paw arthritis score compared to the
vehicle group on days 5 and 12. There were no significant differences in body weight
between the vehicle-treated group and test item-treated groups.
[003281     In view of the findings in the present study, Compound 2 at 7.5 mg/kg or 4 mg/kg
delivered orally exhibited significant anti-arthritic activity in the anti-collagen antibody
induced model of rheumatoid arthritis, with sustained reductions in mean arthritis scores and
reductions in paw thickness.
Efficacy study of Compound 2 in collagen-inducedarthritis(CIA) in Lewis rats
[00329]     Forty (40) female Lewis rats (BK), aged 6 to 8 weeks with a pre-treatment body
weight range of 180 to 200g were divided randomly into four (4) groups (Groups A-D) of ten
(10) rats each. The rats in Groups B to D were immunized intradermally with bovine CII in
IFA at three sites near the base of the tail and over the back with 500 tL of the emulsion on
day 0 (200 [tL, 200 tL, 100 ptL for each site). On day 7, the rats in Groups B-D were given
booster injections with the same amount of the emulsion intradermally near the former
injection sites. In the therapeutic treatment model (Groups C and D), dexamethasone or
Compound 2 was orally administered to rats with CIA after the onset of arthritis, as shown in
Table 6. Rats were weighed daily and a drug holiday was given to an animal when a weight
loss of greater than 13%.

 [00330]     CIA development was evaluated via macroscopic scoring and measurements of
paw swelling. This was assessed every day for the first 5 days after sensitization (day 7) and
then twice per week (Monday and Thursday) for the remaining time with the clinical scoring
 system for each paw shown in Table 7.

[00331]      Foot volume was measured by plethysmometry on the same day of the arthritic
measurement throughout the study period. The cubage of each hind paw and swelling rate
were measured and using the following equation:
                                Swelling Rate = (CN-CO)/ C0 X100%.
FIG. 4A is a graph of joint swelling versus time, and shows the joint swelling measured on a
scale of 0-4 in naive rats and rats treated according to the model, with positive control, or
with Compound 2.
[00332]      Bovine CII (in 10mM acetic acid) at 4 mg/mL was emulsified with an equal
volume of IFA.
[00333]      The clinical scores were summed for each animal, and the total average of all
animals in each group was expressed as the mean arthritic score. FIG. 4B is a graph of
clinical scores as a function of time, and shows the clinical arthritis scores of naYve rats and
rats treated according to the model, with positive control, or with Compound 2.
[00334]      On day 28 of the study, three representatives from each treatment group were
euthanized and hind paws were harvested and stored in 4% neutral buffered formalin.
Prepared sections of hind paws were subjected to hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining.
[00335]      Histopathological analysis of the control animals showed cartilage erosion and
pannus formation in line with course of the disease. However, in the Compound 2 treated
rats, relatively intact cartilagewas found on the joint surface and pannus formation was
minimal. The results of the histological analysis are shown in FIG. 5.
[003361      The Clinical Score, Joint Swelling and histological examination data showed
correlations. The results also showed the therapeutic efficacy of Compound 2 at 4mg/kg
(MPK), as shown by its effects on Clinical Scores, Joint Swelling and histological
examination. The results of the CIA model in Lewis rats are depicted in FIGS. 4A and 4B,
and FIG. 5.

Anti-psoriasisactivity of Compound 2 in phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA)-induced
psoriasisin female BALBIC mice
[003371     Twenty-four (24) female BALB/c mice, aged 6 to 8 weeks with a body weight
between 22 and 30g were used. The mice were randomized into four (4) groups of eight (8)
mice each. The grouping of animals was as follows: Group I (Naive; ethanol), Group II
(PMA; ethanol), Group III (PMA; Compound 2 10 [M) and Group IV (PMA;
betamethasone). Twenty (20)tL of PMA (4ptg/20ptL of acetone) was applied topically on the
upper surface of pinna of ear of all animals in Group II to Group IV. PMA was applied daily
on left ear and on alternate days (M-W-F) on right ear from Day 1 to Day 9. Thirty (30)
minutes after application of PMA, vehicle or standard compound (betamethasone) or
Compound 2 was applied topically to the ears of animals from different groups. Of note,
vehicle, standard compound, and Compound 2 were applied daily to both ears of different
animals from Day 1 to Day 12.
[003381     Animals were observed daily for a period of 12 days for any treatment related
symptoms. Basal ear thickness was recorded in all animals (before application of PMA) using
digital screw gauge at time TO (Day 1). For the entire duration of the study, 4 hours after
application of vehicle, standard compound, or Compound 2, the thickness of the ears was
measured daily using digital screw gauge and scores of erythema, scaling and folding were
recorded. Severity of damage to the pinna of ear was assessed by the scoring systems shown
in Table 8.

[00339]      The animals were supplied with nutritionally balanced autoclaved pelleted feed
(Nutrivet Life Sciences, Pune (India)) ad libitum and had access to normal drinking water
throughout the experimental periods.
[00340]      Commercially available 100% DMSO (LR Grade) and ethanol (LR Grade) were
used to prepare the formulations. PMA was prepared by dissolving 10 mg of PMA in

                                              - 92
50.0mL of acetone. Compound 2 was prepared by dissolving 1.47 mg of Compound 2 in
300 pL of 100% DMSO.
[003411      The experimental results are expressed in FIGS. 6A-6D as mean ± SEM. There
was no significant difference between all treatment groups in body weight, food and water
consumption. PMA application showed, (i) the thickness of left as well as right ear increased
(Group II vs. Naive) and (ii) the disease activity index (DAI) of left as well as right ear
increased (Group II vs. Naive). Importantly, topical application of Compound 2 led to a
prominent reduction in PMA-induced increases in (i) left and right ear thickness, and (ii) left
and right ear DAI. This effect was prominent on Days 6-8 of the study when more animals
treated with Compound 2 had reduced left/right ear thickness (compared to animals from
Group II), and DAI (compared to animals from Group II). Of note, Compound 2-mediated
reduction in PMA-induced increases in left/right ear thickness and DAI diminished as the
study progressed (Day 10 and beyond).
[00342]      In a PMA induced psoriasis model in mice, Compound 2 displayed statistically
significant anti-psoriatic activity.
Anti-psoriasisactivity of Compound 2 in the Imiquimod (IMQ)-induceddermal
inflammation/psoriasismodel (STUDY])
 100343]     Forty (40) male BALB/c mice aged 6 to 8 weeks were used with a pretreatment
body weight of 22 to 30g. The BALB/c mice were randomized into four (4) groups of 10
mice per group. A small area (about 2x2 cm 2 ) of skin on the dorsum of all the animals was
neatly shaved. Group-I animals served as Naive animals. Psoriasis was induced in Groups II
to IV [Group II (IMQ; vehicle), Group III (IMQ; Compound 2 (1 pM)) and Group IV (IMQ;
cyclophosphamide (10 mg/kg)] by topical application of 31.25 mg of IMQ cream daily on the
dorsum of the animals from Day 1 to Day 13. Four hours after application of IMQ, vehicle or
standard compound (cyclophosphamide) or Compound 2 was administered (topically - 30 pL;
orally - according to body weight) to the appropriate group from Day 1 to Day 13 daily. Two
hours after administration of vehicle or standard compound or Compound 2, erythema,
 scaling, folding and thickening of skin were recorded to determine the disease activity index
 (DAI).
 [00344]     Animals were observed daily for a period of 13 days for any treatment-related
 symptoms. The daily observations included body weight, feed intake, skin thickening,
 scaling, folding, erythema, nasal discharge, movement, respiration, hair, distended abdomen,

skin condition, fur, mucous membrane, presence or absence of secretions, eye condition, tail
elevation, motor activity, posture and gait. Severity of damage to the dorsal portion of the
skin was assessed by assigning erythema, scaling, folding and skin thickening scores based
on external observations of skin, according to rubric in Table 9.

water.
1003471     The experimental results shown in FIGS. 7A and 7B are expressed as mean

[00348]     There was no significant difference in the body weight, food consumption and
water intake in the treatment group when compared to the control group during the duration
of the study. Compound 2 diminished IMQ-induced disease manifestation.
[00349]     Compound 2 shows anti-psoriatic activity, as evidenced by the reduction in
disease activity index in comparison to the vehicle treated group. Further, Compound 2
caused this effect without adversely affecting body weight, food and water intake.
Anti-psoriasisactivity of Compound 2 in the Imiquimod (IMQ)-induced dermal
inflammation/psoriasismodel (STUDY 2)
 [003501     Forty (40) male BALB/c mice (Biological E Limited, Hyderabad (CPCSEA
registration number: 36/99/CPCSEA)) were divided into four (4) groups consisting of ten
(10) mice each. Animals were randomized based on their body weight. The groups were
designated as Group-I (Naive), Group-II (IMQ; vehicle (PEG 400 and HPBCD)), Group-Ill
(IMQ; Compound 2 (2.5 mg/kg)) and Group-IX (IMQ; cyclophosphamide (10 mg/kg)).
 [00351]     A small area on the dorsum of each mouse was shaved, ensuring that these areas
were of equal size/area. Psoriasis was induced in Groups II to IV by topical application of 50

                                              -94
mg of IMQ cream daily from Day 1 to Day 6 on the dorsum of the animals. On Day 1 and
Day 2 of the study, four hours after topical application of IMQ, Compound 2 or positive
control (cyclophosphamide) or vehicle were administered to animals in pertinent groups. Of
note, animals in Group II and Group III were subjected to subcutaneous injections, whereas
animals in Group IV received oral administration. The Compound 2, vehicle and
cyclophosphamide treatment was terminated on Day 2. These groups of animals were
maintained on daily IMQ treatments until Day 6. On Day 7, the psoriasis-induced animals
were re-randomized into 3 groups consisting of 10 animals each based on Cumulative
Disease Activity Index (CDAI). From Day 7 to Day 9, animals received vehicle or positive
control or Compound 2. Of note, on these days animals were not treated with IMQ. From
Day 10 to Day 14, the animals were treated alternatively with IMQ (Days 10, 12 and 14), or
vehicle, positive control or Compound 2 (Days 11, 13).
[00352]     All animals were observed daily for a period of 16 days for gross observations,
body weight and feed and water intake. On Days 1 and 2, scorings of erythema, scaling,
folding and thickening of skin were recorded 2 hours after administration of vehicle/positive
control/test compounds, and on Days 3 to 14 scorings were recorded 4 hours after IMQ
application, or administration of positive control, vehicle or Compound 2. The severity of
induction on the dorsum of animal was assessed and scored as shown in Table 10.
 00353]     Vehicle was prepared by dissolving 40 mg of HPBCD in 70.0mL of distilled
water. Compound 2 was prepared by dissolving 3.59 mg in 0.5% PVP and 0.5% Pluronic.
Cyclophosphamide was prepared by dissolving 500 mg of CMC in 100 mL distilled water.

[003551          It was observed that the rate of reduction of disease activity index in animals
treated with Compound 2 was significantly greater than that observed in animals treated with
vehicle. There was no significant difference in the body weight, food consumption and water
intake in the treatment group when compared to the control group during the duration of the
study.
100356]          The results obtained indicate that treatment with Compound 2 diminished IMQ
induced disease manifestation without greatly impacting the consumption of food or water,
and thereby not showing any effect on the body weight of animals in the treated groups.
 The Effect of Compound 2 in Zucker Rats
 [00357]         Twenty-one (21) male Zucker rats aged 7 months were allocated into 3 groups of
N=7 based on equivalent body weights and food intakes. An additional group of N=7 age
matched Zucker lean controls were included as a control. Body weights and food and water
intakes were measured at approximately the same time each day (14:30-15:30h). On
treatment days, dosing was at 14:30-15:30h (approximately 2 hours before lights off).
 [00358]         The Zucker obese and lean controls were orally treated with vehicle (lOmL/kg
 dose volume; 0.5% Pluronic F68 and 0.5% PVP K29/32 in water) on each weekday. Both
 Compound 2 (1.5 mg/kg and 3 mg/kg) groups were orally treated on each weekday (10mL/kg
 dose volume; 0.5% Pluronic F68 and 0.5% PVP K29/32 in water). Prior to the treatment
 phase, 4 days baseline data were collected. The treatment phase was for 16 days and a
 washout phase of 6 days was also included.
 [00359]          FIGS 8A and 8B and FIG. 9 show the effects of Compound 2 on Zucker rats. At
 baseline, there was no significant difference in body weight and daily food intake between

                                              - 96
the 3 Zucker obese groups. However, all groups were significantly different from the Zucker
lean group.
[00360]     Compound 2 (1.5-3 mg/kg oral) produced a dose-related decrease in daily food
intake and body weight over the 16 day treatment period compared to the Zucker control
group. Compound 2 treatment also significantly increased water intake measured over the
same period. There was a significant difference in body weight gain between the 3 mg/kg
Compound 2 group and the Zucker vehicle group. There was no significant difference in
weight gain between the 1.5 mg/kg Compound 2-treated group and the Zucker vehicle group.
[00361]     Compound 2 showed a dose dependent decrease in daily food effect with the
higher dose (3mg/kg) being more effective than the 1.5mg/kg dose. Further, the Compound 2
group at 3 mg/kg showed lower weight gain in comparison to the Zucker control group.
Effect of Compound 2 in diet-induced obesity model
[003621     Male Sprague-Dawley rats of age 2 months were placed on a high fat diet
(Research Diets Inc., product code D12492, 60% kcal% fat) for 3 months. A group of age
matched rats were fed normal lab chow (LabDiet 5001, -13% kcal% fat), these animals
served as controls for DIO group.
1003631     At age 4 months, and 2 months into placement of high fat diet, all rats were
allocated into 3 groups of N=7 based on equivalent body weights and food intakes. Body
weights and food and water intakes were measured at approximately the same time each day.
On treatment days, dosing was at approximately 2 hours before lights off.
[003641     The DIO control group was treated with vehicle (oral, 10mL/kg dose volume;
0.5% Pluronic F68 and 0.5% PVP K29/32 in water) on each weekday. The Compound 2 1.5
mg/kg group was orally treated on each weekday throughout the treatment phase (dose
 10mL/kg dose volume; 0.5% Pluronic F68 and 0.5% PVP K29/32 in water). The Compound
2 3 mg/kg group (l0mL/kg dose volume; 0.5% Pluronic F68 and 0.5% PVP K29/32 in water)
was orally treated initially once daily on each weekday for week 1, then twice weekly
(Monday, Wednesday) for week 2. During treatment weeks 3 and 4, Compound 2 3 mg/kg
treatment continued twice weekly, except dosing was on Monday and Thursday.
 [003651    Prior to the treatment phase, 3 days baseline data were collected. The treatment
phase was for 4 weeks. A washout phase of 10 days was also included.
 [00366]    Compound 2 was supplied in powder form. The test compound had an active
percentage of 65.89%. Active percentage was adjusted using BEW of 1.437 and prepared by

                                               - 97
dissolving into 0.5% w/v Pluronic F-68 and 0.5% w/v PVP K-29-32 vehicle solution. The
vehicle solution was prepared on a weekly basis while Compound 2 was prepared fresh every
2 days and stored at +4'C. Animals were dosed at a volume of 10 mL/kg. Individual doses
were calculated based on the most recent body weights to provide the proper mg/kg/day
dosage.
[00367]      FIGS. 1OA and 1OB and FIG. 11 shows the effects of Compound 2 in the diet
induced obesity model. At baseline, there was no significant difference in body weight and
daily food and water intake between the 3 DIO groups. However, all DIO groups were
significantly different from the regular diet group. Specifically, the animals fed under the
regular diet were of significantly lower body weight relative to rats fed the high fat diet.
Conversely, rats fed the high fat diet consumed significantly less daily food and water
relative to the rats fed the regular diet.
 [00368]     Compound 2 (1.5-3 mg/kg oral) produced a dose-related decrease in daily food
intake and body weight over the 28 day treatment period compared to the DIO control group.
Compound 2 treatment also significantly increased water intake measured over the same
period (F3,27   =  11.2, P<0.01).
 [003691     In terms of treatment effect on body weight gain, this was formally measured as
percentage of body weight change from study day 3. There was a significant reduction in
weight gain in both Compound 2 groups compared to DIO controls at treatment days 7 (study
day 10) and 14 (study day 17).
 [003701     Body weight, food/water intakes were measured daily over the washout phase.
Food intake in the Compound 2 groups was similar to DIO controls. Body weight in the
 Compound 2 groups remained lower than DIO controls.
 [00371]     Compound 2 decreases daily food intake in a dose dependent manner. Compound
2 also affects body weight gain at both 1.5 and 3 mg/kg doses.
 Compound 1 induction of the NrJ2 anti-inflammatorypathway
 [00372]     THP-1 (human acute monocytic leukemia cells) cells were used to evaluate the
 effects of Compound 1 on the Nrf2 pathway in an inflammation environment. Nuclear factor
 (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) is an anti-inflammatory transcription factor. Under normal
 conditions, Nrf2 is kept in the cytoplasm by Kelch like-ECH associated protein 1 (KEAP 1),
 which degrades Nrf2 by ubiquitination. Nrf2 can also move into the nucleus and back into the
 cytoplasm as a CRM 1 cargo. In the current study, Nrf2 was protected from degradation by

                                               - 98
knocking down KEAP 1 with siRNA. Then, KEAP 1-depleted cells were treated with TNFx to
induce inflammation, and the ability of Compound 1 to reverse inflammation by up
regulation of the Nrf2 pathway was tested. To demonstrate activation of the Nrf2 pathway,
the expression of two of its downstream genes NAD(P)H dehydrogenase [quinone] 1 (NQO1)
and epoxide hydrolase 1 (EPHX1) were quantified by quantitative PCR.
[00373]      THP-1 (acute monocytic leukemia) cells were plated in two 10 cm culture dishes
(6*106 cells/dish) with RPMI- 1640 medium (Lonza) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated
fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and 2-mercaptoethanol to a final concentration of 0.05 mM.
Cells in one dish were transfected with 50 nM of KEAPI siRNA (Life Technologies, Silencer
Select, siRNA ID# s18982) using Lipofectamine RNAiMax (Invitrogen), whereas the cells in
the other dish were transfected with 50nM of control siRNA, Block-iT (Invitrogen).
Transfected cells were left for 72 h and the KEAPI knockdown efficiency was calculated
with quantitative PCR using a probe against KEAPI.
1003741       Next, the cells from each of the dishes were divided equally into 4 wells in
different 6-well plates. One of the wells from each of the plates was pre-treated with 1pIM of
Compound 1 for 1 h, followed by 20ng/mL TNFa for 24h. The other wells were treated with
either 1[tM Compound 1 or 20 ng/mL TNFa or neither for 24h. Following the treatment,
RNA was extracted from the cells using an RNA extraction kit (Qiagen). RNA samples from
each treatment group were reverse transcribed and real-time PCR was performed on the
corresponding cDNA sequences using probes against Nrf2 and two of its downstream genes,
NQO1 and EPHX1. THP-1 cells were transfected with KEAP1 siRNA. 40% knockdown
efficiency was achieved. The KEAP 1 knockdown cells were treated with either 1 M of
Compound 1 or 20ng/mL of TNFa or both together for 24h.
 [003751     FIG. 12A shows a 2.5-fold increase in Nrf2 expression in cells treated with a
combination of TNFa and Compound 1 when compared to the untreated cells. But, a similar
(up to a 3-fold) increase in Nrf2 mRNA levels was also found in cells treated with Compound
 1 and TNFa without the KEAP 1 knockdown. Compound 1 or TNFa alone did not have any
 significant effect on Nrf2 expression with or without KEAP 1 knockdown.
 [00376]     FIG. 12B shows the expression of NAD(P)H dehydrogenase [quinone] 1 or NQO1
 in cells with or without KEAP1 knockdown. FIG. 12B shows that KEAPI knockdown had an
 effect on NQO1 expression. Even the sample without any treatment showed a 2-fold increase
 in its mRNA levels upon KEAP1 knockdown. The combination of Compound 1 and TNFa
 resulted in a 4-fold increase in NQO 1 expression for the KEAP 1 knockdown sample

                                               - 99
compared to a 2-fold increase, seen with the same combination in cells without KEAP1
knockdown.
[00377]      FIG. 12C shows the mRNA levels of epoxide hydrolase 1 or EPHX1 in cells with
or without KEAPI knockdown after treatment with Compound 1 and/or TNFa. FIG. 12C
shows that Compound 1 up-regulated the expression of EPHX1 in the presence or absence of
TNFa. KEAP1 knockdown added to the effect of Compound 1, as induction up to 2.5-fold
was observed in the samples with Compound 1 and KEAP 1 knockdown.
[00378]       Treatment with 1 tM Compound 1 for 24 hrs in the presence of 20 ng/mL TNFU
up-regulated Nrf2 signaling. KEAPI knockdown enhanced this effect, as seen by larger fold
induction of NQO1 (4- versus 2-fold) and EPHX1 (2.5- versus 1.5-fold) relative to their
levels of expression without KEAP1 knockdown. The results show that CRM1 inhibition can
activate Nrf2 pathway during inflammation, and suggests that treatment of Compound 1 in
combination with KEAP 1 inhibitors could be more effective than treatment with Compound
 1 alone.
Effects of Compounds 1, 2, and 12 on NF-KB transcriptionalactivity
 [003791      TNFa can induce the transcription activity of NF-xB. This transcription activity is
initiated when IKB, which binds to NFiB and inhibits its activity, is degraded. Then, a
member of the class II family of NF-KB protein, RelA or p65, that forms a heterodimer with a
member of the class I family, p50, moves into the nucleus. The p65 subunit has a
transactivation domain in its C terminus, which activates transcription of inflammation
related genes. Like NF-KB, IKB can also move into the cell nucleus. Nuclear accumulation
of IKB protects the protein from degradation, as degradation occurs mainly in the cytoplasm.
CRM 1 is responsible for the nuclear export of IKB. Therefore, blocking nuclear export of
IKB   through inhibition of CRM1 minimizes NF-KB activity, as nuclear I1B binds NF-KB and
prevents NF-B from binding to DNA sequences.
 [00380]      The compounds were tested on HeLa (adenocarcinoma) cells to quantify their
 ability to inhibit NF-KB transcriptional activity. NF-KB activity was induced in HeLa cells by
 TNFa, and then the compounds were added to inhibit the induced NF-KB activity. Half
maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of several compounds, namely Compound 1,
 Compound 2 and Compound 12, were determined by dose response studies.
 1003811      HeLa cells were plated in a 12-well plate (200,000 cells/well) and cultured in
 Eagle's Minimal Essential medium (EMEM) from Lonza supplemented with 10% heat-

                                             - 100
inactivated fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and 50 pg/mL penicillin/streptomycin
(Invitrogen), and were left overnight to attach. Cells were pre-treated with serial diluted
(started at 30 jaM; 1:3 dilution) compounds for 1 h and then exposed to 20 ng/mL TNFa
(Peprotech) for 4 h in serum free media. After the treatment, the cells were washed with PBS
(Invitrogen), and lysed with RIPA buffer (Themo Scientific). The transcription activity of
NF-iB in the cells was measured by Chemiluminescent Transcription Factor Assay kit
(Thermo Scientific Catalog# 89859), according to the manufacturer's instruction. Briefly,
1.5 mg/mL of RIPA lysed whole cell extract from each treatment were incubated in a 96-well
plate bound with NF-cB biotinylated-consensus sequence. The active NF-iB transcription
factor bound to the consensus sequence was incubated with NF-KB p65 primary antibody and
then with a secondary HRP-conjugated antibody. A chemiluminescent substrate was added
to the wells and the resulting signal was detected using a luminometer. Three separate
experiments were analyzed for each concentration of the IC 50 curves. XLFit model 205 was
used to calculate IC5 0 curves.
[003821      Inhibition of NF-KB transcriptional activity was measured by serial dilutions of
Compound 1, Compound 2 and Compound 12 after 1 h of compound pre-treatment followed
by 4 h of 20ng/mL TNFa exposure. Three independent experiments were scored for each
concentration, with the average being presented here. Compound 1 had an 1C50 value of 1.59
pM, Compound 2 an IC 50 value of 1.22 paM, and Compound 12 an 1C50 value of 1.46 pM.
Evaluationof the effects of Compound ] on the expression of the pro-inflammatoryprotein,
COX-2, in HeLa cells grown in vitro
[003831      HeLa cells were plated in a 6-well culture dish (2.5x10 5 cells/well) with EMEM
medium (Lonza) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen).
Two of the wells of the plate were pre-treated with 10 pM Compound 1 for 30 minutes, at
which time one one of the wells was exposed to 20ng/ml TNFa (Preprotech) for 1 hour. The
other wells were treated with either 20 ng/ml TNFa or nothing for 1 hour. Following the
treatment, RNA was extracted from the cells using RNA extraction kit (Qiagen). RNA
samples from each treatment group were reverse transcribed and quantitative real time (qRT)
PCR was performed on the corresponding cDNA sequences using probes against COX-2
(Life Technologies).
                                                                   5 cells/well) with EMEM
 [003841     HeLa cells were plated in a 6-well culture dish (5x10
medium (Lonza) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen).

                                              - 101
Two of the wells of the plate were pre-treated with 1 iM of Compound 1 for 30 minutes, at
which time one of the wells was exposed to 20 ng/ml TNFa (Preprotech) for 24 hours. The
other wells were treated with either 20 ng/ml TNFa or nothing for 24 hours. Following the
treatment, whole-cell lysates were generated from the cells by lysis with RIPA buffer
supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Roche). Immunoblot detection of
COX-2 protein was performed using an anti-COX-2 antibody (Cayman). Signal intensity for
the COX-2 protein was normalized to that of beta-actin (Santa Cruz) for each sample and
plotted graphically as arbitrary intensity units.
[00385]     Data from the mRNA analysis by qRT-PCR is shown in FIG. 13A. After 1 hour
of treatment, TNFa induced an approximately 8-fold increase in the expression of COX-2
mRNA compared to the control, whereas Compound 1 alone had no effect on the level of
COX-2 expression. Compound 1 was not the cause of the increase in COX-2 mRNA
expression.
[003861     Data from the protein analysis by immunoblot is shown in FIG. 13B. HeLa cells
were left untreated, treated with either 20 ng/ml TNFa or 1 tM Compound 1, or with 20
ng/ml TNFa and 1 pM Compound 1 for 24 hours, then evaluated for the amount of COX-2
protein present by immunoblot detection. COX-2 protein increased by 24 hours in TNFa
stimulated cells compared to untreated control and to Compound 1 treated cells, while
Compound 1 decreased the amount of COX-2 protein in the presence of TNFU. The intensity
of the immunoblot signals for COX-2 protein were normalized to that of p-actin for each
sample and represented graphically.
 [00387]    Compound 1 does not affect the TNFa induced expression of COX-2, but does
reduce the amount of TNFa induced expression of COX-2 protein.
Compound ] localizes inflammation-relatedCRM] cargos to the nucleus
 [00388]    HeLa and THP-1 (human acute monocytic leukemia) cells were treated with
inflammation inducing factor, TNFa, alone or in combination with 1-10 VM of Compound 1
for 4-24 h, and then were analyzed by immunofluorescence (IF) for the nuclear localization
of inflammation-related CRM1 cargo proteins: IKB, Nrf2, HMGB1, FoxP3, FOXOla, RxRa,
PPARy and NFiB (p65 subunit).
 [00389]    For the detection of IkB, Nrf2, RxRa and PPARy localization, cells were pre
 incubated with 10 jtM Compound 1 for 30 minutes, followed by incubation with 20 ng/mL
 TNFa for 4 hrs in serum free media. For detection of HMGB 1, FoxP3 and Foxo 1A, cells

                                             - 102
were pre-incubated with 1 pM of Compound 1 for 2 h, followed by incubation with 20 ng/mL
TNFa for 24 hours. For detection of NFKB, cells were pre-incubated with 1 PM Compound 1
for 2 h, followed by incubation with 20 ng/mL TNFa for 24 hours. Cells were either fixed
with 100% ice-cold methanol (MeOH) and permeabilized/blocked with 0.1% Tween 20, 0.3
M glycine, and 1%BSA in PBS, or fixed with PFA (3%paraformaldehyde and 2% sucrose in
PBS) and permeabilized/blocked with 0.1% Triton-X100 and 1%BSA in PBS. IKB was
detected by the primary rabbit monoclonal (E130) antibody from Abcam (ab32518); Nrf2
was detected by the primary rabbit polyclonal antibody from Santa Cruz (sc722); RxR alpha
was detected by the primary rabbit polyclonal antibody from Santa Cruz (sc553); PPAR
gamma was detected by the primary rabbit monoclonal [E130] antibody from Cell Signaling
(#2443); FoxolA was detected by the primary rabbit monoclonal [C29H4] antibody from
Cell Signaling (#28 80); HMGB1 was detected by the primary rabbit polyoclonal antibody
from Abcam (ab 18256); FoxP3 was detected by the primary rabbit polyclonal antibody from
Abcam (ab 10563); NFKB-p65 was detected by the primary rabbit monoclonal [C22B4]
antibody from Cell Signaling (#4764). The rabbit secondary antibody, Alexa Fluor 488
(Invitrogen, Al 1008) was used for all the staining. Images were taken at 20X magnification.
[003901      Locking inflammation-related CRM1 cargos in the nucleus has adverse effects on
inflammation and, therefore, IF assays can serve as biomarkers for anti-inflammatory effects
of CRMI inhibitors.
 [00391]     IKB is the inhibitor of NFKB that induces the expression of pro-inflammatory
pathways. Because most IKB degradation occurs in the cytoplasm, its nuclear localization
protects IKB from degradation and enables it to bind to nuclear NFKB, blocking the pro
inflammation activity of NFKB. Nrf2 is a leucine zipper transcription factor that induces in
the nucleus the expression of anti-inflammatory activity. HMGB 1 is the high-mobility-group
box 1 factor, and is usually bound tightly to chromatin. Upon active secretion or passive
release from damaged cells, HMGB1 functions as a cytokine and induces the pro
inflammatory response. Locking HMGB 1 in the nucleus prevents its pro-inflammatory
effects. FoxP3, forkhead box P3, functions as a master transcription factor in the
development and function of regulatory T cells that possess immunosuppressive activity.
FOXO 1a is a transcription factor capable of inducing anti-inflammatory genes, such as
angiopoietin-2. Therefore, nuclear localization protects FOXOla from phosphorylation,
nuclear exclusion and subsequent degradation. RxRa is a retinoid nuclear receptor that
regulates the expression of chemokines such as Ccl6 and Ccl9 in macrophages. RxRa is

                                                - 103
essential for the recruitment of leukocytes to sites of inflammation. Nuclear entrapment of
RxRa results in the recruitment and the depletion of transcription co-activators that otherwise
serve to bind pro-inflammatory transcription factors such as NFKB. PPARy is a ligand
activated transcription factor belonging to the nuclear receptor superfamily, and regulates the
expression of anti-inflammation genes.
 [003921     The results, shown in FIGS. 14A and 14B, demonstrate nuclear localization of the
above cargos, even in the presence of TNFa, which is known to induce inflammation. The
results indicate the ability of Compound 1 to induce anti-inflammation pathways to overcome
inflammation.
Evaluation of the effect of Compound ] on cognitive deficits after BCCI injury in rats
 1003931     Bilateral controlled cortical impact (BCCI) injury to the medial frontal cortex
(MFC) of male Sprague Dawley rats was induced by a cortical contusion device. After CCI
any cortical surface hemorrhaging was controlled, and the fascia and scalp were sutured.
 Sham-operated rats were anesthetized, mounted in the stereotaxic apparatus, and a
craniotomy was performed.
 [003941     Progesterone 16 mg/mL was dissolved in 22.5% 2-hydroxypropyl-p-cyclodextrin
 and the initial injection (16 mg/kg) was given i.p. 1 h after injury. The remaining injections
 (all 16 mg/kg) were given subcutaneously at 6 h post-injury and continued for 5 days after
 injury. Progesterone injections were made at a concentration of 1 mL/kg. Progesterone was
 used as a control.
 [00395]     Compound 1 0.2, 0.4, and 0.6 mg/mL was suspended in vehicle (0.6% w/v
 Pluronic@ F-68 and 0.6% w/v PVP K-29/32 in water) and administered p.o at a concentration
 of 10 mL/kg, 16 h before injury and 2 h after injury, and administrations were continued for 4
 days. Control rats received equivalent injections of the vehicle for Compound 1, at the same
 time points. Treatment groups are summarized in Table 11.

[00396]      The Morris Water Maze (MWM) test is a spatial navigation task that measures
learning and memory in rodents using visual cues. Subjects learn over the course of days to
find a hidden platform. A MWM test was conducted two weeks after injury. Male Sprague
Dawley rats were allowed to swim in the pool until they reached the platform located in the
southwest quadrant of a tank, or until 90 seconds had elapsed. Behavior was tracked by a
video camera hanging from above the pool and recorded and analyzed using video track
software (ANY-maze).
[003971      The effects of Compound 1 and progesterone on acquisition of the MWM test are
shown in FIG. 15A. Two way repeated measures ANOVA found a significant treatment
effect. Compared to sham injury rats, BCCI-injured rats showed a significant spatial learning
deficit, as indicated by a significant increase in the latency to find the hidden platform during
the 5-day acquisition phase (FIG. 15A). Compared to vehicle-treated BCCI-injured rats,
Compound 1 (2, 4 and 6 mg/kg) showed a dose dependent decrease in the latency to find the
hidden platform, with significant effects on days 17 and 18 after injury with 6 mg/kg and on
day 18 with 4 mg/kg. The data suggest that Compound 1 has a neuroprotective effect.
 [003981     FIG. 15C is photographs of whole brains of animals receiving sham lesions
(Sham), CCI + vehicle (Control), or CCI + Compound 1 (6 mg/kg), and shows the results of a
qualitative visual inspection of whole brains prior to vibratome sectioning. The
inspection indicated that none (0 of 4) of the Sham animals exhibited damage to dorsal
medial cortical tissue. In stark contrast, all four of the CCI controls exhibited severe bilateral
injury restricted to this region of the cortex. CCI animals which received Compound 1
 showed damage ranging from moderate to minimal. Notably, the brain demonstrating the
most severe injury in the Compound 1 group was less dramatic than all brains in the CCI
 control group.
 [00399]     The expression level of several cytokines in plasma harvested from rats in each
treatment group was measured. The samples were received frozen and stored at -80 'C. On
 the day of the experiment, the samples were thawed, diluted four-fold, and analyzed for

                                                 - 105
cytokine expression on a Luminex platform. The samples were analyzed for the
cytokines GRO/KC, IFNy, IL-IB, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12p70 and TNFa, using a multipliex kit
manufactured by Millipore. As shown in FIG. 15B, the same patterns were observed in
expression levels between samples. The biggest change was in IL-10. Compound 1 at 6
mg/kg reduced IL-10 compared to vehicle-treated control group.
[00400]      In many cases, traumatic injury elicits a secondary injury response. In most cases,
the result will be inflammation. The inflammatory response is driven by cytokines and
chemokines and is partially propagated by damaged tissue derived products (Damage
associated Molecular Patterns).
[00401]      Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome (MODS), a poorly understood syndrome
of sequential and gradual loss of organ function, is the most frequent cause of late deaths
post-injury, accounting for substantial morbidity and mortality. MODS is considered to be
due, in part, to excessive or maladaptive activation of inflammatory pathways.
[00402]      Quantitative measures of cell density were collected from anti-NeuN
immunolabeled subsections from approximately 2-3 mm anterior to bregma. Regions of
interest (ROIs) were drawn (blind to experimental condition) around Layers IV-VI in the
cortical region adjacent to the injury site in CCI-treated animals or in the equivalent zone
(dorsal cortex) in sham animals. An ROI of similar area was also evaluated in a ventral
cortical region of the same section. Cell identification was performed using the cell counting
module of Keyence BZ-II Analyzer software. Cell-to-gray matter (CG) area coefficients were
determined for each ROI. Sham animals exhibited uniform dense labeling within both dorsal
and ventral regions. As expected, CCI control animals showed reduced CG coefficients in
both dorsal (-45% compared to sham) and ventral (-30% compared to sham) cortical zones
versus sham animals (FIG. 15D). The CCI-induced reduction in CG coefficient was mitigated
by treatment with Compound 1 in the ventral cortex (-3% compared to sham; p = 0.09).
Although the effect of Compound 1 versus vehicle treatment in the ventral cortex is not
statistically significant, it is anticipated that this effect would breach statistical significance in
a larger study. No effect of Compound 1 was detected in the dorsal cortical region (-32%
compared to sham) immediately adjacent to the injury site. The difference in the observed
effect of Compound 1 on the ventral region versus the dorsal region may be a threshold effect
related to the degree of injury, which was inversely related to the distance from the injury
site. Thus, the damage to the dorsal cortical region could be too severe to be rescued by
Compound 1 under these conditions.

                                               - 106
[00403]     Immunofluorescence was performed to evaluate the impact of TBI on several
pathways of immune response, and to determine if Compound 1 might be mediating its
neuroprotective effects via one or more of those pathways. Semi-quantitative measures of
secondary injury responses were examined using immunofluorescent labeling for anti-Rat
IgG (an indicator of blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability), and TNFa (an indicator of
neural inflammation). All markers were imaged at 20X magnification in the areas of the
cortex surrounding the injury site in adjacent subsections within 300 tm to those used for the
NeuN labeling assessments. For each label, a target ROI was outlined within Layers IV-VI
adjacent to the injury site (or an equivalent region of dorsal cortex for sham animals), and a
reference ROI was collected from the same laminae in ventral cortex. Normalized
fluorescence intensity was assessed in each of the two ROIs. For all labels, the ventral cortex
reference site was determined not to be different between groups (p>0.5); therefore, the
percent target to reference value (IF) was determined.
[00404]      Anti-Rat IgG was expressed in neurons (indicated by the arrowhead in FIG. 15E)
in injured tissue. FIG. 15E shows that the anti-rat IgG was distributed within the neurophil of
damaged areas of cortical tissue. Anti-rat IgG was not present in sham tissue. TNFa
immunopositive cells (indicated by the arrowhead in FIG. 15E) were clearly visible in
damaged tissue surrounding the injury site in control animals. These elements were largely
absent in Compound 1-treated and sham animals. FIG. 15E shows that Compound 1 reduces
secondary injury responses in rats exposed to brain injury.
Collagen-inducedArthritis (CIA) Study No. 2
 [00405]     To further investigate the effect of the compounds described herein on
inflammation biomarkers, a second CIA model was initiated. In this model, the groups were
designated as group A (naive), group B (model; vehicle-treated), group C (Compound 2 at 5
mg/kg QoD). The rats in groups B and C were immunized intradermally with bovine Type II
 collagen in IFA on day 0, and a booster injection was given on day 7. Compound 2 was
 orally administered to rats with CIA after the onset of arthritis (Day 11). CIA development
was evaluated via macroscopic scoring and measurements of paw swelling. This was
 assessed every day for the first 5 days after sensitization (day 7), and then twice per week
 (Monday and Thursday) until Day 28 using the clinical scoring system described in Table 7
 above. In addition, ELISAs for CD45, CRP, CCL2/MCP-1, TNF-cU, IL1-p, IL-6, IL-17, and
 measurements for cathepsin K and elastase were performed 4 days (Day 15 of the study) and

                                             - 107
10 days (Day 21 of the study - peak for the disease) after compound treatment and at the very
end of the study (Day 28) on all group animals. Additionally, on the last day of the study
(Day 28), a few representative animals from each group were subjected to three-dimensional
micro-tomodensitometry of calcaneus, and bone erosion in the paws was quantified.
[00406]     FIGS. 16A and 16B show that rats treated with Compound 2 at 5 mg/kg had
significantly reduced joint swelling (FIG. 16B) and clinical scores (FIG. 16A) compared to
vehicle-treated rats.
[00407]     FIGS. 17A and 17B show that rats treated with Compound 2 at 5 mg/kg had
significantly reduced bone erosion in the rear paws compared to vehicle-treated rats. Joint
condition in animals treated with Compound 2 was comparable to that of naive animals. In
contrast, vehicle-treated animals displayed statistically significant increased bone erosion in
their rear paws.
[004081     A LUMINEX@ assay and ELISA were used to measure the effects of Compound
2 on the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and inflammation markers. Synovial fluid was
collected on Day 21, after the first immunization, from 2 rats in the model group and 2 rats in
the Compound 2-treated group, and at the end of the study from 2 rats in the naive group, 3
rats in the model group and 3 rats in the Compound 2-treated group.
 [004091    FIGS. 17C- 17F show that, compared to the model group, Compound 2 showed
inhibitory effects on the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and an inflammation
marker in synovial fluid samples. The reduced cytokines include IL-l , IL-6 and MCP-1,
and the inflammation marker is C-reactive protein (CRP).
 [004101    A LUMINEX@ assay was also used to meaure the levels of pro-inflammatory
cytokines in serum. Serum samples (1 mL of blood per rat) were collected 4 days after
compound treatment (Day 15), 10 days after compound treatment (usually at the disease peak
- Day 21) and at the end of the study (Day 27).
 [00411]    FIG. 17G shows that, compared to the model group, Compound 2 showed an
inhibitory effect on IL- 1P production in serum samples.
Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis (EAE) Model
 [004121     The EAE Model is an accepted model for the study of human CNS demyelinating
 diseases such as multiple sclerosis. The effects of Compound 1 were investigated in MOG
 induced in an EAE murine model in female C57B 1/6J mice. The animals were divided into 3
 groups designated as Group I (vehicle control), Group II (dexamethasone-positive control)

                                              -108
and Group III (Compound 1 at 7.5 mg/kg). Saline, dexamethasone and Compound 1 were
administered according to the schedule shown in FIG. 18A. Saline and dexamethasone were
administered intraperitonally every day starting from day 0. Compound 1 at 7.5 mg/kg was
administered orally starting from day 11 (disease onset) on Monday, Wednesday and Friday
for 3 consecutive weeks. The disease was induced by the single intradermal injection of
MOG emulsified in Complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA) on study day 0, followed by
intraperitoneal supplemental immunostimulation with pertussis toxin (PT) carried out on
study day 0, and again 48 hours later on study day 2.
[00413]     As shown in FIG. 18B, the first signs of the disease were noticed 7-9 days
following MOG immunization and the disease peak developed on study day 17. Treatment
with dexamethasone starting from day 0 at a dose of 1 mg/kg IP significantly reduced the
clinical scores on study days 8-37 (Group II) when compared to the vehicle control (Group I).
Treatment with Compound 1 starting from Day 11 at a dose of 7.5 mg/kg (Group III)
significantly decreased disease score and severity. These results are shown in FIG. 18B.
[004141     In view of the findings obtained under the conditions of this study, treatment with
Compound 1 at a dose of 7.5 mg/kg p.o. starting on study day 11 resulted in a decrease in
disease score and severity.

Evaluation of the effects of systemic administrationand topical applicationof Compound ]
on C57BL mice skin wounds
100423]     The effects of Compound 1 on skin wound healing were studied in a mouse
longitudinal full thickness skin incision wound model. Upon arrival, animals were identified
by ear tags, weighed and left to acclimate for several days before initiation of the experiment.
On the day of wounding, mice were weighed and divided into 6 experimental groups with 6
animals per group, in accordance to weight differences stratified randomization. Prior to the
surgical procedure, mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and the back of the animals was
trimmed. Full thickness longitudinal incisions of 20 mm were performed using a standard
scalpel blade on the backs of the animals (parallel to the backbone). Three hours after
wounding, due to skin elasticity and activity of the animals, the incisions took on elliptical
shapes. At this stage, the widest area of the wound was measured to establish a baseline
wound width. Wound healing evaluation was made by measuring the widest area of the
wound. Treatment groups consisted of oral gavage or topical groups. During the experiment,
wounds were photo-documented and morphological analysis was performed. At the end of
the experiment, 8 days post wounding, mice were sacrificed, wound widths were measured
and biopsies of the wound area were collected and subjected to analysis.

[004241      Dosing solutions were prepared fresh on each day of dosing. Compound 1 for oral
gavage was supplied as a lyophilized powder and reconstituted in aqueous 0.6% w/v
Pluronic@ F-68 and 0.6% w/v PVP K-29/32 solution to make a 0.75 mg/mL stock
suspension, which was subsequently diluted with aqueous 0.6% w/v Pluronic@ F-68 and
0.6% w/v PVP K-29/32 for preparation of working solutions of 7.5 mg/kg and 4 mg/kg.
Compound 1 for topical application was supplied as a lyophilized powder and suspended in
water to a concentration of 10 mM, which was further diluted with water to achieve a final
working concentration for topical application.
[00425]      As a part of a daily morphological assessment, photo-documentation was
performed using a digital camera FinePix S700. FIG. 19 is photographs of representative
wounds from each experimental group on Day 5 post-wounding. The black scale bar
represents 1 cm. A total of 33 wounds were made in 33 mice. The morphological
assessment demonstrated the positive effect of treatment with Compound 1, either orally or
topically. All treatments induced superior wound healing than controls. Treated wounds were
smaller in size and the scabs were lighter, thinner and homogenous without cracks, indicating
a later stage of wound healing. When evaluated on the same day as treatment groups, control
group wounds appeared larger in size and were covered with thick cracked scabs that exposed
a non-healed wound area (observed as reddish and pink areas) both at the edges and in the
middle of the wounds.
 1004261     Morphological analysis is the primary parameter utilized in wound healing
assessment in preclinical studies on animals and in clinical treatments of human wounds.
Based on morphological analysis, Compound 1 displayed efficacy, and had a positive impact
on wound healing. Of note, both topical application and systemic administration of
 Compound 1 resulted in better wound healing, as measured by wound size reduction and
better scabbing properties.

Evaluation of the effects of topical application of a test compound on pig skin wounds
 [004271    The effects of a test compound on skin wound healing can be studied in a pig
longitudinal full thickness skin incision wound model. Upon arrival, animals are identified by
ear tags, weighed and left to acclimate for several days before initiation of the experiment.
Three days prior to the surgery, pigs are transferred to the hospitalization facility for
acclimation. Twelve hours prior to the procedure, food is withheld. On the day of surgery, the
pig is anesthetized using ketamine, xylazin, diazepam and isoflurane. The hair on the dorsum
thorax and abdomen is carefully cut using an Oster@ clipper machine (blade size 30) and 20
individual regions of 4 cm 2 each are marked in two rows (10 regions per row). Ten pairs of
2.5 cm full thickness longitudinal skin incisions are made using #11 scalpel blade, 4 cm from
either side of the dorsum midline.
 [004281     Following the surgical procedure, wounds are divided into experimental groups
and treated daily by topical application on the wound area and on wound edges. Treatment
area consists of a surface of skin up to a distance of 2 cm from the wound center. Dosing
solutions are applied gradually on each wound using a pipette, until the entire treatment
volume (for example, 1 mL of saline or test compound) is absorbed by tissue.
 [004291     Several hours after wounding, due to skin elasticity and activity of the animals,
the incisions take on elliptical shapes. At this stage, the widest area of the wound is measured
to establish a baseline wound width. Wound healing evaluation is made by measuring the
widest area of the wound. During the experiment, wounds are photo-documented and
morphological analysis is performed.
At the end of the experiment (for example, 12 days after wounding), pigs are sacrificed by
administration of anesthetic and KCl. Wound morphology is assessed, wound width is
measured and biopsies of wound area are harvested and fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde for
further analysis. Following fixation, wound biopsies are photo-documented using high
resolution digital camera, for example, a FinePix S700, and biopsies of the wound area are
 subjected to histopathological analysis. Assessment of wound healing is performed in a
paired manner in which each wound treated with test compound is directly compared to the
 control wound at the same anatomical location on the other side of the dorsum midline. This
paired assessment of healing is crucial in terms of objective assessment and objective
 comparison of treated wounds to non-treated because of variability associated with a degree
 of vascularization and blood circulation in the skin at different areas of the pig's back.

Wounds located in the front area near the neck display far better healing properties than
wounds located on the rear back.

Evaluation of the effects of topical applicationof a test compound on early wound healing
processes in pigs
 1004321      The effects of a test compound on early wound healing can be studied in a wound
model of longitudinal full thickness skin incision in pigs. Five pairs of 2.5 cm longitudinal
 full thickness incisions are performed on the frontal section of the back of anaesthetized pigs
using #11 scalpel blades, 4 cm from either side of the dorsum midline. Within several hours
post-procedure, the longitudinal incision becomes an elliptical wound.
 [00433]      Wounds are divided into experimental groups and treated daily by topical
 application on the wound area (including edges and on skin area near the wound). Treatment
 phase starts 24 hours following wounding. Dosing solutions are applied gradually on each
 wound using a pipette, until the entire treatment volume is absorbed by tissue (for example, 1
 mL of saline or a test compound).

[004341      On day 5, the state of wound healing and morphology is assessed according to the
following parameters: bleeding, oozing, swelling, inflammation, pus secretion and scab
formation. Assessment is performed in a paired manner in which each wound treated with the
test compound is directly compared to the control wound at the same anatomical location on
the other side of the dorsum midline.

preparation of the final 3 tM topical solution.
 [00436]     A morphological wound healing assessment is conducted on Day 5 of treatment.
Swelling is examined, scored according to the severity in each wound and documented as
mild, moderate or severe. Wounds that exhibit moderate and severe swelling are presented as
a percentage of total wounds in experimental group. Secretion is examined and scored in a
binary mode: a wound that exhibited minimal secretion was considered positive and, a wound
without any detectable secretion is considered negative for this parameter. Wounds that
exhibit secretions (positive for this parameter) are presented as a percentage of total wounds
in experimental group. A scab is considered completely formed when a continuous layer of a
hard, dry, reddish, dark yellow or brown formation covered the entire wound area and is
 strongly attached to the wound bed and, therefore, provided a continuous and strong barrier
between the external environment and the wounded tissues. Scab formation is examined and
 scored in a binary mode: wounds which exhibited a completely formed scab which was dry
 and strong are considered as positive and wounds without a scab or with scabs at an earlier
 stage are considered as negative for this parameter. Wounds with a completely formed scab
 are presented as a percentage of total wounds per group.
 [004371     Swelling, secretion and scab formation are also evaluated. Swelling and secretion
 are part of an excessive inflammatory response that might delay tissue repair and induce
 unaesthetic scarring.

Evaluation of the effects of topical applicationof a test compound on early wound healing on
pig skin and on irritationsand scratchingassociatedwith damaged or wounded skin
[00438]      The effect of a test compound on skin wound healing can be studied in a
longitudinal full thickness skin incision wound model in pigs. Three days prior to surgery,
pigs are transferred to the hospitalization facility for acclimation. Twelve hours prior to the
surgical procedure, food is withheld. On the day of surgery, the pigs are anesthetized using
ketamine, xylazin, diazepam and isoflurane. The hair on the dorsum thorax and abdomen is
cut using Oster@ clipper machine (blade size 30). Ten pairs of 4 cm 2 each sections are
marked, and 2.5 cm full thickness longitudinal skin incisions are made using #11 scalpel
blade, on either side of the dorsum midline.
100439]      Following surgical procedure, wounds are divided into experimental groups and
are treated daily by topical application on the wound area (including edges and on skin area
near the wound up to a distance of 2 cm from the wound in all directions). Dosing solutions
are applied gradually on each wound using a pipette, until the entire treatment volume is
absorbed by tissue (for example, 1 mL of vehicle or test compound).
[004401      Within several hours post-procedure, the longitudinal incision becomes an
elliptical wound due to skin elasticity and activity of the animals. During the experiment,
wounds are photo-documented and morphological analysis is performed. Assessment of
wound healing is performed in a paired manner in which each wound treated with test
compound is directly compared to the control wound at the same anatomical location on the
other side of the dorsum midline. During the first 5 days following wounding, wound
morphology and animal behavior are recorded.

supplied as a lyophilized powder and dissolved in 100% DMSO to a stock concentration of
15 mM. Further dilutions in injectable water are performed to achieve a final concentration of
3 ptM and 1p M for topical application.
[00442]     As part of the daily morphological assessment, photo-documentation of the
wounds is performed using, for example, a digital high resolution camera FinePix S700. In
addition to the wound status, areas of irritated and scratched skin are observed. Usually, the
scratching does not cause damage to the wounds or interfere with the wound healing process
because the wound is inflicted on the back near the dorsum midline, such that it is hard and
almost impossible for the animal to reach the wounds.
Evaluation of the effects of Compound ] in in PVP/Pluronic@F-68 and Compound ] in
water on scratchingassociatedwith skin healing in mice
[00443]     In the skin wound studies described herein in mice, the behavior of the animals
was also observed, and attempts to remove scars, signs of discomfort, and scratching of the
wound area were quantified. Abnormal behavior and abnormal displays of scratching and
signs of pain from all the studies performed in mice were analyzed. In these studies,
treatment was performed using Compound 1 in PVP/Pluronic@ F-68 and Compound 1 in
water, and the respective vehicle controls.
 [00444]    During all wound healing experiments in mice, monitoring of healing parameters
associated with wound healing, signs of skin irritations and other skin conditions at the area
near the wound and the treated skin area, was performed. Additionally, during the treatment
phase of all skin healing models, special attention was paid to the behavior of the animals,
such as signs of discomfort and pain; and signs of scratching and tampering with wounds and
 skin. Soothing and calming effects of the treatment compounds were highly obvious in
comparison to control animals, which were predisposed to tamper with their wounds.

                                              -116
[00445]     In mice, treatment with Compound 1 in PVP/Pluronic@ F-68 or Compound 1 in
water reduced the incidence of tampering with wounds in comparison to the vehicle treated
mice (DMSO in water, saline, PVP/pluronic or water).
[00446]     In mice, tampering with wounds usually resulted in the removal of the scab and
bleeding or damage to the newly formed tissue on the wound bed that was strongly attached
to the scab. The vast majority of such incidents happened in vehicle treated groups (about 20
- 30% in all experiments).
[004471     According to the summary of skin conditions and animal behavior, it can be
concluded that treatment of wounds with Compound 1 in PVP/Pluronic@ F-68 or Compound
1 in water prevented tampering with wounds in mice, possibly, due to some soothing and
calming effects of the treatment compounds on wounded and irritated skin.
Dose response of a test compound on skin wound healing in mice
[004481     The effects of a test compound on skin wound healing can be studied in mice
longitudinal full thickness skin incision wound model. Upon arrival, animals are identified
by ear tags, weighed and left to acclimate for several days before initiation of the experiment.
On the day of wounding, mice are weighed and divided into 7 experimental groups (N=6 or
N=7), in accordance to weight differences stratified randomization. The vehicle group
receives 0.1% DMSO in water while the positive control group is treated with an aqueous
0.6% w/v Pluronic@ F-68 and 0.6% w/v PVP K-29/32. Prior to the surgical procedure, mice
are anesthetized with isoflurane and the hair on the back of the animals is trimmed. Full
thickness longitudinal incisions of 20 mm are performed using a standard scalpel blade on the
backs of the animals (parallel to the backbone). Three hours after wounding, due to skin
elasticity and activity of the animals, the incisions take on elliptical shapes. At this stage, the
widest area of the wound is measured to establish a baseline wound width. Wound healing
evaluation is made by measuring the widest area of the wound. Treatment of wounds is
performed by topical application (daily) of dosing solutions (for example, 0.2 mL) directly on
wounds.

final topical solution. Wounds in control groups are topically treated with 0.1% DMSO in
water, or aqueous 0.6% w/v Pluronic@ F-68 and 0.6% w/v PVP K-29/32 solution.
[00450]      At the end of the experiment, 8 days post wounding, mice are sacrificed by
inhalation of CO 2 , wound widths are measured and biopsies of the wound area are collected
and subjected to histological analysis. The biopsies are fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde.
Following fixation of the entire wound area, a dissection of 5 mm of the widest area of the
wound is performed and these specimens are subjected to paraffin embedding. Paraffin
blocks are prepared utilizing standard procedures of graduate dehydration and paraffin
embedding of tissues. Thereafter, histological sections are prepared and tissues are stained
with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stain. H&E stained slides are examined and assessment of
wound healing efficacy is performed.
 [00451]     Advanced dermal closure is assessed on Day 8 by the examination of eosin
stained healthy dermis and the newly formed dermis edges at the wound gap. Wounds with
both dermal edges observed in 100x magnification field of the microscope (BX41 Olympus
or Axiovert 25, Zeiss) are considered positive for the advanced dermal closure healing
parameter. The number of wounds with advanced dermal closure is presented as a percent of
total wounds in experimental groups.
 [00452]     Advanced epidermal closure is assessed on Day 8 using H&E staining by
analyzing histological section at the widest area of the wound. Wounds that exhibit the
presence of a continuous layer of epidermis covering the entire wound gap and wounds with

                                                -118
the most advanced migration of the epidermal edges observed in the microscope field at 400x
magnification are considered positive to advanced epidermal closure parameter. The results
are presented as a percent of total per experimental group.
 [00453]     Epidermal migration is assessed on Day 8 using H&E staining by analyzing
condensed hematoxylin stained newly formed epidermis at both wound edges. The epidermal
edge is considered migratory when newly formed epidermal edge covered about 20-30% of
the wound gap. Migratory epidermal edges in the groups are counted and presented as a
percent of total number of epidermal edges (twice the number of wounds in the group). Both
epidermal edges are considered migratory in wounds that exhibited complete or advanced
epidermal closure. A total of 62 wounds are made in 62 mice.
 Treatment ofwounds with a test compoundprevents wound healing complications, such as
hyperplasiaof the epidermis and adhesions
 [00454]     The effects of a test compound on skin wound healing can be studied in a mice
longitudinal full thickness skin incision wound model. Prior to the surgical procedure, mice
 are anesthetized with isoflurane, and the back of the animals is shaved. Full thickness
 longitudinal incisions of 20 mm are performed using a scalpel blade on the backs (parallel to
backbone) of the animals. Three hours after wounding, due to skin elasticity and activity of
the animals, the incisions take on elliptical shapes. Wound healing evaluation is made by
measuring the widest area of the wound. Treatment of wounds is performed by topical daily
 application of, for example, 0.2 mL of test compound directly on the wounds. Wound care
 process is partially in a moist environment - after each daily treatment, wounds are wet for
 some time. At the end of the experiment, 8 days post wounding, mice are sacrificed, wound
 widths are measured and biopsies of the wound area are collected and subjected to
 histological analysis.

epidermal edges are assessed using H&E staining by analyzing condensed hematoxylin
stained areas of the epidermis. When the epidermal edge appears thicker than normal
epidermis in a healthy skin area and when such an epidermal edge does not exhibit migration
toward sealing the wound gap, it is considered to be hyperplastic and non-migratory.
[00458]     Adhesions at the wound gap are assessed on on Day 8. Adhesions are assessed by
analyzing cellular and tissue structures at the wound gap. The wound adhesions are scored on
a mild, moderate or severe scale. A negative score is considered when there is a clot at the
wound gap or normal granulation tissue is replaced by other tissue, such as skeletal muscles
or extensive lymphoid tissues. Several adhesions or abnormal granulation occupying more
than 40% of the wound gap area are considered as severe. Adhesion is considered mild when
it is non-significant and does not interfere with normal skin tissue renewal. Wounds with
severe adhesions are calculated as a percent of total wounds per experimental group and
graphed as shown. A total of 32 wounds (64 epidermal edges) are made in 32 mice.
 [004591     One of the most important wound healing complications is hyperplasia of the
epidermis. As a response to the stress signals associated with wounding, proliferation of cells
in the basal layer of the epidermis occurs to compensate for skin loss. Normally, in
uneventful wound healing, epidermal cells initiate migration toward sealing the wound gap

                                               - 120
soon after proliferation. When migration does not occur or is slowed down, for example, in
skin complications caused by hyperglycemia in diabetic wounds, epidermal hyperplasia
becomes prominent, and may cause even more complications in wound healing. In acute
open wounds, as in the model employed in this experiment, or in acute sutured wounds, such
as post-surgical wounds, a decline in epidermal healing associated with hyperplasia of
epidermal edges increases risk for contamination and other wound healing complications
such as wound dehiscence, fluid draining from the wound, or tissue protruding from the
wound.
[00460]     In an effective wound healing process, the primary blood clot undergoes gradual
changes in order to form granulation tissue at the wound gap, which, following remodeling,
eventually becomes newly formed skin tissue with fully restored functions. When adhesion
of non-skin related tissues occurs in the wound gap, granulation tissue does not form properly
and, as a result, final tissue remodeling is limited. This may cause further limitations in the
functions of healed skin.
Treatment of wounds with a test compound in a saline-basedformulation improves wound
healing andprevents severe adhesions
[00461]     The effects of a test compound on skin wound healing were studied in a mouse
longitudinal full thickness skin incision wound model. Surgical procedures are performed on
7-8 weeks old C57BL male mice anesthetized with isoflurane. Prior to surgical procedure,
mice are anesthetized with isoflurane and the fur is cut. Full thickness longitudinal incisions
of 20 mm are performed using a standard scalpel blade. Three hours after wounding, due to
skin elasticity and activity of the animals, the incisions take on elliptical shapes. At this stage,
the widest area of the wound is measured to establish a baseline wound width. Wound
healing evaluation is made by measuring the widest area of the wound. Treatment of wounds
is performed by a daily application of a topical 0.2 mL solution directly on the wound. The
wound care process is conducted partially in a moist environment because after each daily
treatment, wounds are wet for some time (3-5 hours). At the end of the experiment, 8 days
post wounding, mice are sacrificed, wound widths are measured and biopsies of the wound
area are collected and subjected to histological analysis.

[00462]      Dosing solutions are prepared fresh on each dosing day. Test compound is
supplied as a lyophilized powder and reconstituted in saline to make a 3 mg/mL stock
suspension, which is subsequently diluted with saline to achieve a working concentration of 3
  tM for topical application. Wounds in control groups are topically treated with saline.
[004631      At the end of the treatment phase, 8 days post-wounding, mice are sacrificed by
inhalation of CO 2 and biopsies of wound area are harvested. Fixation of wound tissues is
performed using 4% paraformaldehyde. Following fixation of the entire wound area, a
dissection of 5 mm of the widest area of the wound is performed and the dissected area is
subjected to paraffin embedding. Paraffin blocks are prepared using standard procedures of
graduate dehydration. Thereafter, histological sections are prepared and tissues are stained
with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). Wound healing parameters are assessed and graphed.
[00464]      Epidermal closure is assessed using H&E staining by analyzing histological
sections at the widest area of the wound. Wounds which exhibit the presence of a continuous
layer of epidermis covering the entire wound gap, and wounds with the most advanced
migration of the epidermal edges when both edges were observed in the microscope field at
400x magnification are considered positive for the advanced epidermal closure parameter.
The results are presented as a percent of total per experimental group.
100465]      Dermal healing is assessed by the examination of eosin stained healthy dermis and
the newly formed dermis edges at the wound gap. Wounds with both dermal edges observed
in 100x magnification field of the microscope (BX41 Olympus or Axiovert 25, Zeiss) are
considered positive for the advanced dermal closure healing parameter. The number of
wounds with advanced dermal closures is presented as a percent of total wounds in
experimental groups.
 [00466]     Granulation tissue is assessed utilizing H&E staining. When the primary fibrin
clot is replaced by fibrous connective tissue containing adipocytes, new capillaries and an
infiltrate containing lymphoid cells, macrophages, and plasma cells the granulation tissue is
considered early. Early granulation tissue replaced by tissue with a high abundance of
fibroblasts and collagen fibers is considered advanced. Overall, areas of advanced granulation
tissue at the wound gap are documented as percent of the total wound gap area. A wound gap
displaying advanced granulation tissue formation covering 40% of the wound gap is

                                              - 122
considered positive for this parameter. Results are calculated as a percent of total wounds per
group.
[00467]     Adhesions are assessed by analyzing cellular and tissue structures at the wound
gap. The wound adhesions are scored on a mild, moderate or severe scale. A negative score is
considered when there is a clot at the wound gap or normal granulation tissue is replaced by
other tissue, such as skeletal muscles or extensive lymphoid tissues. Several adhesions or
abnormal granulation occupying more than 40% of the wound gap area are considered as
severe. Adhesion is considered mild when it is non-significant and does not interfere with
normal skin tissue renewal. Wounds with severe adhesions are calculated as a percent of total
wounds per experimental group. Nineteen wounds (38 epidermal edges) were made in 19
mice.
Evaluation of the effects of topical applicationof a test compound on healingprocess and
scarringin the late stages of wound healing on pig skin
[00468]     The effects of a test compound on late stages of skin wound healing are studied in
a pig wound model of longitudinal full thickness incision. On the day of surgery, the pig is
anesthetized using ketamine, xylazin, diazepam and isoflurane. The hair on the dorsum
thorax and abdomen is cut and 10 pairs of 2.5 cm full thickness longitudinal skin incisions
are performed using a #11 scalpel blade, 4 cm from either side of the dorsum midline.
Following the surgical procedure, wounds are divided into experimental groups and treated
daily by topical application on the wound area and on wound edges including treatment of
skin near the wound area up to a distance of 2 cm from the wound in all directions,. Dosing
solutions are applied gradually on each wound using a pipette, until the entire treatment
volume (for example, 1 mL of vehicle or test compound) is absorbed by the tissue. The skin
near the wound is treated with gauze soaked in test compound or vehicle solution.
 [00469]     During the experiment, wounds are photo-documented and morphological
analysis is performed. At the end of the treatment phase (day 19 post-wounding), pigs are
sacrificed by dosing of anesthetic and KCl. Morphology of the wounds is examined, wounds
are photo-documented and biopsies of wound area are harvested for fixation and further
morphological and histological analysis.

concentrations of 3 .M and 1p M for topical application.
[00471]      At the end of the treatment phase (day 19 post-wounding), the assessment of
wound healing is performed. Fully healed wounds are reported as a percent of total wounds
per group. The average width of scars in the wounds that healed completely and exhibited
full scab detachment is also reported. Scars were measured (mm) and the average width of
scars and standard deviation are calculated. A total of 20 wounds was performed.
 [00472]      At the end of the treatment phase (day 19 post-wounding), pigs are sacrificed by
an overdose of anesthetic and KCl and biopsies of wound area are harvested. Fixation of
wound biopsies is performed using 4% paraformaldehyde. Following fixation, wound
biopsies are photo-documented using, for example, a digital camera FinePix S700 at the
highest resolution.
