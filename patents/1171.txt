          BAG AND METHOD OF FILLING THE GEO-CONTAINER BAG IN-SITU
Related application
This application is related to Australian Provisional Patent Application No. <removed-apn>, filed
7 March 2017, in the name of Fibertex South Africa (Pty) Ltd, the entire content of which is
incorporated herein by reference as if fully set forth herein.
Field of the invention
The invention relates to geo-containers.
Background of the invention
Geo-bags, geo-synthetic containers or geo-containers are essentially bags filled with sand
or other materials which are used to add support and re-inforce eroded, collapsing or
damaged areas or surfaces. An example of geo-container bag application is the protection
of coastal environments such as beaches against wave damage, tidal erosion, as well as
wind and rain damage. Geo-containers are used to enhance structural stability in
environments where traditional hard structures have failed previously, or would not be
suitable.
There are many types of geo-containers used in various environments, and there are
different methods used to fill these bags.
Conventional geo-containers are filled through ports provided at the edge or sides of a bag,
held in place by a seam. A tube is used to assist with the filling, wherein the tube is made of
light non-woven material sewn into the portal. This tube is opened and secured to an outlet
of a hopper or chute which feeds a mixture of sand and water into the bag through the port.
The water escapes through the porous fabric from which the bag is made, and the sand
remains in the bag. Once filled, the bag is placed in abutment with other bags. This creates
a wall-like structure which helps provide the protection from tidal erosion, wave and weather
damage to the existing surfaces such as beaches, lakes, dams and/or river banks.

                                                  2
The aesthetic appearance of the geo-containers tends to be more environmentally friendly
as the soft profile of the bag is more visually appealing than other structures, such as
concrete structures. The aesthetic appeal is further improved through the accumulation of
sand, earth, algae and plant growth that helps mask the geo-container structure.
The bags are filled with low resilience sand. There is less resistance than that of more rigid
materials. Due to this lower resistance and easier passage of water through the bag, the
displacement of the bag from its initial placement position is reduced or even prevented.
Once these bags have been filled, the fabric is typically tucked and sewn closed to seal the
bag.
The disadvantage of the above known bags and methods of filling is that there is a need to
use expensive and heavy equipment as well as customized loading hoppers specifically
designed to fill the bags.
Typically these bags are not filled in situ, and must be transported to the site for further
placement. These sites may be remote from where the bags are filled, and often the sites
are inaccessible or have limited accessibility, and are therefore environmentally sensitive.
Environmental considerations must be made, and this may affect the filling, transporting and
placing of the bags. Heavy wheeled machinery, time and labour are required in getting the
filled bags to their final location. This leads to further expenses.
A known method of filling bags in a marine environment is to fill the bag in a split bottom
barge. There are problems associated with this method, including incorrect placement,
damage or breaking of the bag upon placement from the barge, as well as the high costs of
using a barge to carry out such operations.
Some of the other related prior art will be discussed below.
US6186701 relates to a geocontainer with filling tubes located on the upper surface, which
are attached to the outside of the bag. Openings need to be cut in the upper surface of the
geocontainer bag. The filling tube is then attached around the opening. In order to seal the
opening, the filling tube must be sealed. If the sealed filling tube fails, the geocontainer may

                                                 3
fail. This may require additional time, effort and means to ensure proper sealing of filling
tubes.
US2014/0010601       discloses a geocontainer with a filling conduit located on the upper
surface, the filling conduit extends through an opening formed through the top of the
geocontainer. The geocoantainer is cellular, in that it is made up of shelves which are joined
or interconnected to form a generally triangular shaped geocontainer. The specification does
not disclose where and how the conduits are attached to the geocontainer. Furthermore, the
openings are not sealable. In order to seal the opening, the filling tube must be sealed. If
the sealed filling tube fails, the geocontainer may fail. This may require additional time, effort
and means to ensure proper sealing of filling tubes.
EP0267661 discloses a dyke body with a supply inlet or connection tube which can be rolled
up and stored under a protection flap. Alternatively, in another embodiment, the tube may
be rolled up under a flap which covers the tube. The flap is a separate attachment, and an
extra piece of material is sewn/ stitched onto the outside of the upper panel of the bag. This
would take time, and more material. This pocket or flap does not seal the opening or the
filling tube effectively. In addition to the above, filling of the body is restricted and may be
slowed because of this flap. The flap restricts the expansion of the filling tube as well as it
appears that filling needs to be done at an angle in some embodiments of the invention
disclosed, while in others there is a slot in the flap, however, the slot is narrow and would
pitch and ultimately restrict expansion of the filling tube when filling. Furthermore, there is
no securing means provided to secure or seal the opening in the bag. In order to seal the
opening, the filling tube must be sealed. If the sealed filling tube fails, the geocontainer may
fail. This may require additional time, effort and means to ensure proper sealing of filling
tubes.
US5902070 provides for a geocontainer with port holes and chimneys which can be tied off
The geocontainer bag comprises two layers of geotextile material. Openings need to be cut
in the upper surface of the geocontainer bag. The filling tube is then attached around the
opening. In order to seal the opening, the filling tube must be sealed. If the sealed filling tube
fails, the geocontainer may fail. This may require additional time, effort and means to ensure
proper sealing of filling tubes.

                                                 4
The applicant is of the opinion that the invention overcomes or partially alleviates some of
the above identified problems, wherein the invention provides an improved geo-container
bag.
Summary of the invention
According to a first aspect of the invention, there is provided a geo-container bag fillable in
situ, the geo-container bag including at least one filling tube, and wherein the bag includes
an opening in an upward facing panel of the bag, an end region of the filling tube being
attached to the inside surface of the upward facing panel of the bag such that the filling tube
is able to be pulled through the opening for filling and tucked into the opening, in a tongue
like manner, when filling has been completed.
The opening preferably includes a fastening means for sealing the opening. After filling the
bag, the filling tube may be rolled or folded up, tucked into the opening, and the fastening
means fastened to seal the opening.
The fastening means may include apertures, configured near the opening, and a yarn thread
inserted through the apertures, such that the opening may be laced up and sealed by a user.
The apertures may include pre-cut eyelets. The opening may be made up of one or more
slits in the upward facing panel of the bag. The opening may be a slit in the upward facing
panel of the bag. The opening may be X-shaped and formed by two slits which cross each
other such that four flaps are formed which are opened when the filling tube is pulled through
the opening and the flaps remain open during filling of the bag through the filling tube, and
when filling is completed, the flaps can close and may be sealed closely together to aid in
sealing the opening. Other suitable openings may be configured on the upper panel of the
bag, such as a star shaped opening made of multiple crossing slits.
The filling tube may be stitched to the inner surface of the upward facing sheet of the bag.
The stitching may or may not be visible on the upward facing sheet of the bag. The filling
tube may be attached to the inner surface of the upward facing panel using an adhesive
such as glue or any other suitable attachment means. The filling tube is typically elongated.
The filling tube and opening configuration improves both filling and sealing of the filled bag.
By attaching the filling tube to the inner surface of the upward facing panel of the bag, there

                                                  5
is direct flow of the sand and water mixture inside the bag. The opening may almost act like
a one-way valve, due to being narrow and elongated, as opposed to a wider and exposed
opening such as an hole or portal. After filling, the filling tube may be sealed using a fastener,
such as a cable tie or other suitable means. Thereafter the filling tube may be rolled or folded
up. The bag is then sealed when the yarn thread is threaded through the pre-cut eyelets and
the opening laced shut, which also prevents the filling tube from dislodging form the inside
of the bag.
The filling tube may be made from a light-weight material when compared to the material
used for the fabric forming the layers of the bag. The filling tube may be 140 mm in width,
and has a supporting stitch width of between 50 to 80 mm, and a supporting stitch length of
175 mm.
The filling tube is preferably positioned centrally on upper side of the bag.
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the geo-container bag comprises a non-woven
dual component fabric comprising a first outer layer which is needle punched into a second
inner layer, and wherein the edges of the dual component fabric are double stitched to form
the edges of the bag, and wherein the at least one filling tube is centrally located on an
upward facing surface of the bag, wherein the bag is fillable in-situ through the filling tube.
The first outer layer may be made from a staple fibre geotextile material. The staple fibres
may be needle punched together. The first outer layer may include polypropylene fibres.
The polypropylene fibres may be heavy, coarse, and/or UV stabilized. The polypropylene
fibres may assist in trapping sand particles and promoting growth of natural marine
vegetation which improves the bags durability.
The first outer layer may include a material which is durable, robust, abrasion resistant, UV
resistant, vandal resistant, friction resistant, and/or neutrally coloured.
The second inner layer may be made from a staple fibre geotextile material. The second
inner layer may include a high strength base fabric material.
The first outer layer is needle punched into the second inner layer.

                                                6
The non-woven dual component fabric may be manufactured by sewing together robust
staple fibre geotextile layers with a UV stable polyester overlocked yarn.
The double stitch includes, firstly stitching two equally sized panels of the dual component
fabric together using a standard chain stitch. The double stitch includes, secondly using an
overlock stitch which assists the standard chain stitch in holding the panels together in a
seal-tight manner.
The bag size may be made to suit different environments and conditions. For example, a
bag subjected to strong waves and/or tidal fluctuations will be more robust, larger and
denser, as opposed to bags used in a lakeshore environment, which will be smaller and less
dense bags.
In an embodiment on the invention, the bag when in an empty condition may be
approximately 2.3 metres in length, 1.8 metres in width, 0.02 metres in height, and have a
weight of 7.5 kilograms.
In this embodiment of the invention, the bag when in a filled condition may be approximately
between 2 to 2.2 metres in length, between 1.6 to 1.75 metres in width, between 0.5 to 0.6
metres in depth, and have an weight of between 3300 to 4000 kilograms.
In another embodiment of the invention, the bag when in an empty condition may be 2
metres by 2.5 metres in size.
The bags, once in a filled condition, may be pillow shaped.
The bag may include at least one securing flap, wherein the flap is made up of a piece of
fabric which is connectable to a portion of the bag, preferably connected to the bag at the
ends or sides of the bag that abut with a further bag. The flap may assist in reducing and/or
preventing the scouring of sand or other natural material away surrounding the base region
of the base or bottom bag, which is positioned on the surface. The scouring is caused by
the force of waves or other environmental conditions. A portion of the flap may be secured
under a portion of an adjacent bag. The weight of the adjacent filled bag on the flap assists
in securing the bag in a particular location, and ensures that the bag is not displaced from
its original installed position, even though the material under it has been scoured away.

                                               7
Further wave action or environmental conditions may restore the sand or other natural
material surrounding the base region of the bag in time.
The bag may include one or more grommets configured on the outer surface of the bag,
such that at least two adjacent bags may be tethered together. The grommets may be
configured on the corners of the side of the bag which may be concealed upon installation.
The grommets may include heavy duty brass rings.
The grommets may be configured at two corners of a side of the bag, typically at the rear
end of each bag, wherein the adjacent bags may be tied together through the grommets,
using a tying means. The grommets allow the bags to be tethered together securely, which
limits or reduces displacement of the bags caused by the environmental conditions, such as
current, waves and the like.
The bag corners may be stitched 100 mm from the corner at 45 .
The bag may include a yield control element for increasing the structural rigidity and strength
of the bag when filled. The yield control element may extend across a portion of the inside
of the bag, wherein at least two of the ends of the yield control element may be connected
to at least two sides of the bag. The yield control element may be in the form of one or more
straps, the ends of which are attached to opposing sides of the bag.
According to a further aspect of the invention there is provided a method of manufacturing
the geo-container bag described above, the method including:
        needle punching a piece of the first outer layer of a pre-determined size into a piece
        of the second inner layer of a pre-determined size, to form the non-woven dual
        component fabric; and
        double stitching the edges of the dual component fabric to form the edges of the bag,
        wherein
        the double stitching includes standard chain stitching, and overlock stitching.
The method further includes making at least one opening may be made in an upward facing
panel of the bag.

                                               8
The opening may be punched. The opening may be cut forming a slot in the upward facing
panel.
The method further includes attaching at least one filling tube in a central position on an
upward facing panel of the bag, aligned above the at least one opening in the upward facing
panel.
The at least one filling tube may be attached to the inner surface of the upward facing panel
of the bag. The filling tube may be stitched to the inner surface of the upward facing sheet
of the bag. The filling tube may be attached to the inner surface upward facing panel using
an adhesive such as glue.
Markings may be made on the upward facing surface indicating where it is to be cut to create
an opening, and indicating where the filling tube is to be attached.
The attached filling tube may be pulled through the opening in the upward facing panel of
the bag, such that the filling tube may extend outside of the bag, for assisting the filling of
the bag.
The opening in the upward facing panel may include a fastening means for sealing the
opening, wherein the fastening means may include pre-cut eyelets configured near the
opening, and a yarn thread inserted through the eyelets, such that the opening may be laced
up and sealed by a user.
In an embodiment of the invention, the step of double stitching the edges of the dual
component fabric to form the edges of the bag may include placing two panels of dual
component fabric together and double stitching the edges of the dual component fabric to
form the edges of the bag. The panels may be equally sized.
In another embodiment of the invention, the step of double stitching the edges of the dual
component fabric to form the edges of the bag may include double stitching the edges of a
single panel of dual component fabric, folded over, wherein three sides of the bag are double
stitched to form the bag.

                                                 9
The method of manufacturing the bag may further include securing one or more grommets
to one or more corners of the bag.

                                                 11
Detailed description of the drawings
It should be appreciated to those skilled in the art that, without derogating from the scope of
the invention as described, there are various alternative embodiments or configurations or
adaptions of the invention and its features.
Referring to Figures 1 to 3 the geo-container bag 10 comprises at least one filling tube 12
positioned centrally on the bag 10, the at least one filling tube 12 is centrally located on an
upward facing surface of the bag 10, and wherein the bag 10 is fillable in-situ through the
filling tube 12. An end region of the filling tube 12 is stitched 12A to the inner surface of the
upward facing panel 24 of the bag 10. The bag 10 includes two grommets 20 configured at
two corners of a side of the bag 10, typically at the rear end of each bag 10, wherein the
adjacent bags 10 are tied together through the grommets 20, using a tying means. The
grommets 20 include heavy duty brass rings. The bag 10 corners are stitched 100 mm from
the corner at 45 .
Referring to Figures 4a and 4b, the bag 10 comprises a non-woven dual component fabric
14 comprising a first outer layer 16 which is needle punched into a second inner layer 18,
and wherein the edges of the dual component fabric 14 are double stitched to form the edges
of the bag 10.
The first outer layer 16 is made from a staple fibre geotextile material. The staple fibres are
needle punched together. The first outer layer 16 includes polypropylene fibres. The
polypropylene fibres are heavy, coarse, and/or UV stabilized. The polypropylene fibres
assist in trapping sand particles and promoting growth of natural marine vegetation which
improves the bags 10 durability. The first outer layer 16 includes a material which is durable,
robust, abrasion resistant, UV resistant, vandal resistant, friction resistant, and/or neutrally
coloured. The second inner layer 18 is made from a staple fibre geotextile material. The
second inner layer 18 includes a high strength base fabric material. The first outer layer 16
is needle punched into the second inner layer 18.
The non-woven dual component fabric 14 is manufactured by sewing together robust staple
fibre geotextile layers with a UV stable polyester overlocked yarn.

                                                12
The double stitch includes, firstly stitching two equally sized panels of the dual component
fabric 14 together using a standard chain stitch. The double stitch includes, secondly using
an overlock stitch which assists the standard chain stitch in holding the panels together in a
seal-tight manner.
Referring to Figure 5 to 8, the bag 10 includes an opening 22 in the upward facing panel
24 of the bag 10. The filling tube 12 is stitched 12A to the inner surface of the upward facing
panel 24 of the bag 10. The filling tube 12 is pulled through the opening 22 and extended,
and can be tucked into the opening 22. The filling tube 12 is made from a light-weight
material when compared to the material used for the fabric 14 forming the layers of the bag
10. The filling tube 12 is typically 140 mm in width, and has a supporting stitch width of
between 50 to 80 mm, and a supporting stitch length of 175 mm. The opening 22 in the
upward facing panel 24 includes pre-cut eyelets 32 configured near the opening.
The bag 10 size is made to suit different environments and conditions. For example, a bag
10 subjected to strong waves and/or tidal fluctuations will be more robust, larger and denser,
as opposed to bags 10 used in a lakeshore environment, which will be smaller and less
dense bags 10. The bag 10 once in a filled condition is pillow shaped.
The bag 10 includes a yield control element (not shown). The yield control element extends
across a portion of the inside of the bag 10, wherein at least two of the ends of the yield
control element are connected to at least two sides of the bag 10. The yield control element
is in the form of one or more straps, the ends of which are attached to opposing sides of the
bag 10.
Referring to Figure 9, the bag 10 includes at least one two securing flaps 26, wherein the
flap 26 is made up of a piece of fabric which is connectable to a portion of the bag 10,
preferably at the line of stitching on the sides or ends of the bag 10 that will abut with a
further bag 10. The flap 26 assists in reducing and/or preventing the scouring of sand or
other natural material away surrounding the base region of the base or bottom bag 10, which
is positioned on the surface. The scouring is caused by the force of waves or other
environmental conditions. The securing flap 26 is locatable such that a portion of the flap 26
is secured under an adjacent bag 10, which ensures that the bag 10 remains in its original
installed position even though the material under it has been scoured away. Further wave

                                                 13
action or environmental conditions restores the sand or other natural material surrounding
the base region of the bag 10 in time.
Referring to Figures 10 and 11, the method of filling the geo-container bag 10 includes the
steps of positioning the geo-container bag 10 in an empty condition on a surface and/or filled
geo-container bag 10 such that the upper surface of the empty bag 10 is exposed; fastening
the at least one filling tube 12 positioned centrally on the upper surface, to a feeder pipe 28
which is connected to a supply of a mixture of water and sand; feeding the mixture of water
and sand such that the bag 10 is filled to a filled condition; and sealing the filling tube 12,
which seals the filled bag 10.
Referring to Figures 7a, 7b, 8 and 11, sealing the filled bag 10 includes tucking the filling
tube 12 into the bag 10 through the opening 22, wherein the filling tube 12 may be rolled up
from the outside and tucked into the bag 10 through the opening 22. Sealing the bag 10
further includes sealing the opening 22 by sealing the fastening means, wherein yarn thread
30 is laced up through the eye-lets 32.
Figure 12 shows two bags 10 positioned next to each other, both filled and sealed. The
bags 10 have also been surrounded by sand 100.
Referring to Figure 13, the alternative version of the opening 22 is X-shaped, and formed
by two slits which cross each other. When filling is completed, the opening 22 is sealed close
together to aid in sealing the bag 10 effectively. The X-shaped opening 22 has been sealed
with thread 30.
Referring to Figures 14 to 16, the bag 10 is filled by inserting the feeder pipe 28 into the
filling tube 12 and holding it in place. The feeder pipe 28 is connected to a supply of a mixture
of water and sand, which is pumped into the bag 10. As it is pumped into the bag 10, it is
filled. Once filled, the filling tube 12 can be sealed using a cable tie 34, as shown in Figure
15, and thereafter tucked into the opening 22 which is then sealed with thread 30, as shown
in Figure 16.
