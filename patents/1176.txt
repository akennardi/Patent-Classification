                                  Arrangement for parcel delivery
             Area of technology: an invention relates to delivery of parcels and manners to
   reduce manual work and manners to enhance work productivity.
                                        Background of the technology
 5           E-commerce has become very popular and consumers order huge amounts of
   products that are packed into parcels and the parcels are delivered to the customers. In a
   click & collect service the parcels are collectable in automated parcel lockers (also known
   as a packet automaton). A conventional packet automaton includes fixed lockers and thus
   an employee of a logistics company needs to open a closure (a locker door) to place a
10 parcel into the locker and thus filling of lockers may take a lot of time.
             DE19716138, US7307238, F120155359, and W0<removed-apn> describe packet
   automatons that can be filled in an easy manner. None of those packet automatons has
   fixed lockers but storage spaces such that the storage spaces are arranged in a cart and the
   cart can be placed or parked besides a wall comprising locker doors. After the parking each
15 storage space in the cart is available through one of the locker doors.
             F120165669 describe a moveable packet automaton which is termed a delivery
   trailer because it can be transported with a road vehicle. The delivery trailer comprises a
   trunk for carts or frames filled with products. When the carts or frames are moved inside
   the trunk the delivery trailer is ready to be transported to a delivery site.
20           F120176060 describes automated guided vehicles (AGVs) and delivery trailers.
   The AGVs can load the trunk of a delivery trailer in a cost-effective manner.
             The above-mentioned publications DE19716138, US7307238, and F120155359
   represent a fixed packet automaton which suits especially for local use. The local use
   means that a picking site, where products are picked into carts, is located in proximity of a
25 delivery site, i.e. in proximity of the fixed packet automaton to be filled.
             A known "last mile problem" problem especially concerns a home delivery
   service because in said service each customer usually receives one parcel at a time and an
   employee doing the delivery needs to stop at each customer's home, which consumes a lot
   of time. Locker systems provide an alternative to the home delivery service.

                                                    2
             Locker systems can be utilized on a delivery area where customers are willing to
   collect their parcels from lockers. Compared to the home delivery service, the locker
   systems enhance work productivity in the delivery. In other words, more parcels per time
   unit can be transported to the locker systems than to homes.
 5           A delivery time window specifies how long parcels are kept in a locker system. If
   the delivery time window is long, for example one week, the work productivity may be
   low assuming that an employee visits each day the locker system and places new parcels
   into it and collects parcels, which customers are placed into lockers, because sometimes
   only few parcels are to be transported to the locker system and each stop takes time. When
10 using locker systems the work productivity can be enhanced by a) reducing the number of
   stops within a transportation of parcels, b) reducing the average time required per stop,
   and/or c) transporting a greater number of parcels within the transportation.
                                          Summary of the invention
15            An aspect of the present invention is to provide solutions to the last mile problem
   when using locker systems. Another aspect of the present invention is to enhance the work
   productivity by transporting a greater number parcels within a transportation. Another
   aspect is to reduce the average time required per stop. Another aspect is to reduce the
   number of stops within the transportation.

                                     Detailed description of the invention
             It is appreciated that the following embodiments are exemplary. Although the
   specification may refer to "one" embodiment, the reference is not necessarily made to the
   same embodiment(s), or the feature in question may apply to multiple embodiments.
 5           FIGURE 1A shows a fixed locker system 101 that is installed at a delivery area
   102. In this example fixed locker system 101 includes only two lockers. Delivery area 102
   is, for example, a postal code area (also known as a zip area or postcode area).
             Fixed locker system 101 comprises first lockers including lockers 103, 104, a first
   locker frame 105, and first openable closures 106, 107 such that first locker frame 105
10 includes at least some of the first lockers and is movable. First openable closures 106, 107
   are able to close openings to lockers 103, 104. The openings to lockers 103, 104 are closed
   when first locker frame 105 is placed besides first openable closures 106, 107. Fixed locker
   system 101 has a first delivery time window for the parcel delivery. The first delivery time
   window is, for example, one week meaning that customers are expected to collect their
15 parcels within seven days from fixed locker system 101.
             Fixed locker system 101 further comprises locker identifiers 108, 109 for the first
   lockers such that locker identifiers 108, 109 are permanently attached to first locker frame
   105 and each of locker identifiers 108, 109 is readable with an optical reader and reading
   of a locker identifier 108 with the optical reader indicates for a logistics computer that a
20 locker 103 having locker identifier 108 includes a parcel. The logistics computer is a part
   of an ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) system that forms pairs such that each pair
   includes a locker identifier, such as locker identifier 108, and a parcel identifier. Said pairs
   provide essential control data for fixed locker system 101.
             View 110 shows locker identifier 108 as magnified. Locker identifier 108 is in
25 this example a barcode that is placed on the upper edge of locker 103. An original barcode
   (when it was invented) was made up of lines and spaces of various widths. The original
   barcode had two different bars for coding information: a thin bar and a thick bar. Australia
   Post barcode is can be mentioned as an example a one-dimensional barcode. Australia Post
   barcode standard has four bar heights for coding information. Japan Post barcode is
30 another example of a barcode standard having four bar heights.

                                                    6
             Other examples of one-dimensional barcodes are EAN-8 and EAN-13 both of
   which are used in worldwide. The International Article Number (also known as European
   Article Number or EAN) is made for global trade to identify a product type, a packaging
   configuration, and a manufacturer. The standard has been subsumed in the Global Trade
 5 Item Number (GTIN) standard from known GS 1 organization. EAN barcodes are used
   worldwide at retail point of sales, but they can also be used for other purposes, for
   example, as locker identifiers 108, 109.
             Bars in a barcode are not necessarily black. KarTrak ACI is on example of
   colored bars (this barcode is used in North America on railroad).
10           In addition one-dimensional (ID) barcodes, there are two-dimensional variants
   made of rectangles, dots, hexagons, and other geometric patterns. They are termed matrix
   codes or 2D barcodes (although they don't include bars as such). A 2D barcode can contain
   more data per surface area unit than a ID barcode.
             The present invention is not limited to any specific barcode standard. Locker
15 identifier 108 can be coded by using a known standard or some new standard. The barcode
   in view 110 is an example of locker identifier 108 implemented as an EAN-13 barcode.
   Locker identifier 108 is divided into four portions 111-114 so that
             a first identifier portion 111 includes two digits from the second digit to the third
   digit (digits 90 in view 110),
20           a second identifier portion 112 includes two digits from the fourth digit to the fifth
   digit (digits 12 in view 110),
             a third identifier portion 113 includes two digits from the sixth digit to the seventh
   digit (digits 34 in view 110), and
             a fourth identifier portion 114 includes six digits from the eighth digit to the
25 thirteenth digit (digits 123457 in view 110).
             The leftmost barcode portion 115 in view 110 is unused in this example. Before
   mentioned identifier portions 111-114 can be used for coding address and the locker
   system information into barcodes.

                                                   7
             In one embodiment locker identifier 108 discloses at least one of the following
   pieces of information: a) locker 103 in first locker frame 105 so that the piece of
   information, i.e. the locker number, is coded in first identifier portion 111 and/or b) first
   locker frame 105 in fixed locker system 101 so that the piece of information, i.e. the locker
 5 frame number, is coded in second identifier portion 112.
             In one embodiment locker identifier 108 further discloses at least one of the
   following pieces of information: c) a locker system (at delivery area 102) coded in third
   identifier portion 113 and/or d) delivery area 102 coded in fourth identifier portion 114.
   The locker system c) is, for example, fixed locker system 101.
10            When locker identifier 108 is composed of identifier portions 111-114, locker
   identifier 108 is a unique locker identifier in a specific state or country. A benefit is that an
   employee of a postal sorting hub, or some other employee, does not need to type the
   address and locker system information, because all identifier portions 111-114 can be
   simultaneously read with a barcode reader.
15           FIGURE 1B illustrates fixed locker system 101 when it is implemented as a
   conventional locker system with fixed lockers. In other words, the conventional locker
   system is missing a movable locker frame (such as first locker frame 105 in Fig. 1A).
   Fixed locker system 101 is installed at delivery area 102 and it comprises lockers 103, 104
   and a first delivery time window for first parcels to be delivered by lockers 103, 104, and
20 first openable closures 106, 107 such that first openable closures 106, 107 are able to close
   the first openings to lockers 103, 104.
             FIGURE 2 shows an example of fixed locker system 101 comprising two locker
   frames, including first locker frame 105 and locker frame 201, and two parking spots 202,
   203 for the locker frames. First locker frame 105 is out of its parking spot 202 thus
25 openings 204, 205 to lockers 103, 104 are visible. After the parking, opening 204 is located
   behind closure 106 and opening of closure 106 provides an access to locker 103.
             In this example first locker frame 105 comprises altogether twenty-two lockers of
   which locker 206 represents the largest locker size. First locker frame 105 has handles 207,
   208 for moving it. Locker identifier 108 is a QR code which is attached to first locker
30 frame 105 on the left side of opening 204.

              FIGURE 3A shows an arrangement 300 for parcel delivery. Arrangement 300
   comprises fixed locker system 101 installed at delivery area 102. Fixed locker system 101
   comprises lockers 103, 104 and a first delivery time window for first parcels to be
   delivered by lockers 103, 104, and first openable closures 106, 107 such that first openable
 5 closures 106, 107 are able to close first openings to lockers 103, 104.
              In one embodiment fixed locker system 101 comprises locker frames, such as first
   locker frame 105 shown in Fig. lA. For example, fixed locker system 101 in Fig. 2
   represents such locker system. In another embodiment fixed locker system 101 is the
   conventional locker system with fixed lockers, as illustrated in Fig. 1B.
10            Arrangement 300 comprises a movable locker system 301 having wheels and an
   attachment point 302 for transporting it. Movable locker system 301 comprises second
   lockers 303, 304 and a second delivery time window for second parcels to be delivered by
   second lockers 303, 304, and a second locker frame 305 (inside moveable locker system
   301). Movable locker system 301 further comprises second openable closures 306, 307
15 such that second locker frame 305 includes at least some of second lockers 303, 304 and is
   movable, and second openable closures 306, 307 are able to close the second openings to
   second lockers 303, 304.
              Arrangement 300 comprises a road vehicle 308 comprising a trunk 309 and a
   trailer attachment point 310 and road vehicle 308 is intended for a transportation of the
20 first parcels and the second parcels to delivery area 102 such that the first parcels are inside
   trunk 309 and the second parcels are inside movable locker system 301 and movable locker
   system 301 is attached to trailer attachment point 310 for the transportation. A van and a
   truck are examples of road vehicle 308.
              In this example a starting point 311 of the transportation is located outside of
25 delivery area 102. In one embodiment starting point 311 of the transportation is one of the
   following sites: a sortation hub, a postal soiting hub, a warehouse, or an operations centre.
   A delivery site 312 for the transportation is located at delivery area 102. In one
   embodiment delivery site 312 is located at proximity of fixed locker system 101 such that
   within a same stop of road vehicle 308, the first parcels are placed into fixed locker system
30  101 and movable locker system 301 is detached from trailer attachment point 310.

                                                    9
              In one embodiment the first delivery time window concerning fixed locker system
    101 is longer that the second delivery time window concerning moveable locker system
   301. In one embodiment the first delivery time window is a week and the second delivery
   time is day. The last mentioned embodiment means that road vehicle 308 (or another
 5 appropriate road vehicle) visits each day delivery area 102 and simultaneously it transport
   parcels for fixed locker system 101.
              In one embodiment arrangement 300 comprises first locker frame 105. In more
   detail, first locker frame 105 is movable and it includes at least some of the first openings
   in fixed locker system 101 and at least one of lockers 103, 104, and first locker frame 105
10 is intended to be transported in trunk 309 of road vehicle 308.
              FIGURE 3B shows other embodiments of the arrangement 300. In this example
   starting point 311 of the transportation is located at delivery area 102. In one embodiment
   starting point is a (local) post office. In one embodiment the first parcels and the second
   parcels are transported by a heavy road vehicle to delivery area 102 and there, at starting
15 point 311, the first parcels are loaded into trunk 309 of road vehicle 308 and the second
   parcels are loaded into movable locker system 301. A large truck, a truck with a trailer, or
   a truck with a semitrailer, is an example of the heavy road vehicle.
              In Fig. 3B arrangement 300 comprises a trolley 321 for the first parcels such that
   trolley 321 is intended to be transported in trunk 309. Trolley 321 is a known tool that has
20 a bottom plate, wheels at the corners of the bottom plate, three fixed side, and one
   openable side. In this example, road vehicle 308 has a side door 322 to trunk 309. Side
   door 322 is slid to its open position and a light loading bridge 323 is placed such that
   trolley 321 can be taken via light loading bridge 323 out of trunk 309. The rest of details
   are the same as in Fig. 3A (and they are omitted).
25            FIGURE 4 shows an example of movable locker system 301 that is termed a
   delivery trailer. It comprises openable pairs of doors 401 and five parking spots 402-406
   for locker frames, such as second locker frame 305. In more detail, parking spots 402-406
   are located inside the trunk of the delivery trailer. Second locker frame 305 has eight
   lockers on its both sides and four legs at it bottom plate. An AVG (automated guided
30 vehicle) 407 is conveying first locker frame 105 indoor space at a sortation hub into
   movable locker system 301.

                                                    10
              FIGURE 5 shows a delivery point 501 for two different locker systems, i.e. for
   fixed locker system 101 and moveable locker system 301. A shelter 502 protects the both
   locker systems from rain. Size of shelter 502 is, for example 5 m x 6 m. Fixed locker
   system 101 is almost as long as one side of shelter 502. Movable locker system 301 is
 5 parked on parking spot 503 under shelter 502. A space between fixed locker system 101
   and movable locker system 301 includes a free parking spot 504.
              Fig. 5 illustrates a situation when an employee of a logistic company is arriving to
   delivery point 501 with a road vehicle and another movable locker system. The employee
   will park the movable locker system onto parking spot 504 after which the employee takes
10 a trolley out of the trunk of the road vehicle and picks parcels from the trolley and places
   them into fixed locker system 101. When the trolley is empty the employee collects parcels
   from fixed locker system 101 into the trolley. Then the employee moves the trolley into the
   trunk, detaches the movable locker from the road vehicle, and attaches the road vehicle to
   movable locker system 301 whose delivery time window is ended. Finally, the employee
15 frees parking spot 503 by transporting movable locker system 301, for example, to a
   sortation hub to be filled thereat with new parcels.
              FIGURE 6 shows four plans 601-604 about delivery sites and transportations on
   delivery area 102. In more details, plans 601-604 concern the parcel transportations within
   one day to various locker systems.
20            Starting point 311 of the transportations is marked with letter 'S'. The delivery
   sites are marked with black dots and letters which specify a type of locker system in the
   following manner. Letter ' F' refers to a fixed locker system, letter 'M' refers to a
   moveable locker system and letters 'FM' refer to such delivery site that provides the both,
   i.e. a fixed locker system and a moveable locker system.
25            Arrows represent (transportation) legs such that a stop of road vehicle 308 starts
   and ends each leg. Each leg and each stop consumes time. The transportation is considered
   to be the more efficient, the more parcels are moved into locker systems.
              One unit means here the volume of trunk 309 of road vehicle 308. One unit also
   means the volume of movable locker system 301. In other words, trunk 309 and movable
30 locker system 301 are assumed to have the same storing capacity for parcels.

                                                     11
              First plan 601 illustrates delivery sites which are implemented using conventional
   locker systems (with fixed lockers) and one week delivery time window. The only
   transportation in first plan 601 is composed of four legs (four arrows) and, within the
   transportation, parcels are moved into the three fixed locker systems, and some other
 5 parcels are collected from them. The capacity of trunk 309 is divided among the three
   locker systems and thus the delivery capacity of each delivery site is 1/3 unit and the total
   capacity on delivery area 102 is one unit. This estimate and the following capacity
   estimates cannot substitute calculations with real values.
              Second plan 602 illustrates a situation in which the three fixed locker systems are
10 replaced with three movable locker systems. There are three transportations and each of the
   transportations is composed of two legs: a leg from starting point 311 to a delivery site and
   another leg from the delivery site back to starting point 3 11. Compared to first plan 601,
   second plan 602 is more efficient, because the delivery capacity of each delivery site is one
   unit. Therefore, the total delivery capacity on delivery area 102 is three units. A drawback
15 of second plan 602 is that it assumes that all customers are willing to collect their parcels
   within one day delivery time window. Another drawback of second plan 602 is that trunk
   309 is not utilized in the transportations.
              Third plan 603 illustrates a situation in which the three fixed locker systems are
   still in use and there are three additional delivery sites for three movable locker systems.
20 Customers have two options to collect their parcels: one day delivery time window or one
   week delivery time window. Third plan 603 solves the drawback of second plan 602. The
   total capacity on delivery area 102 is four units assuming that the total capacity is the sum
   of the capacities mentioned in first plan 601 and second plan 602.
              Fourth plan 604 illustrates a situation in which three fixed locker systems and
25 three movable locker systems are arranged to three delivery points, for example, to
   delivery point 501. The total capacity is the same as in third plan 603 (but less stops).
              While the present invention has been described in connection with a number of
   exemplary embodiments, and implementations, the present invention is not so limited, but
   rather covers various modifications, and equivalent arrangements, which fall within the
30 purview of prospective claims.
