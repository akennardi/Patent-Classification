                                                   ABSTRACT
 A method for dispensing a product from an interior volume of a container to which a power assembly is
secured, the method comprising:
        (1) rotating an actuator sleeve of the power assembly in one direction 3600 or less relative to the
        container to draw an amount of the product from the interior volume into a pump chamber and to
        pressurize the pump chamber;
        (2) temporarily depressing an actuator of the power assembly to open a valve that is in fluid
        communication with the pump chamber and that is normally biased to be in a closed position to
        dispense a portion of the product from the pump chamber through a nozzle for a duration of time
        during which the actuator is temporarily depressed;
        (3) releasing pressure on the actuator to permit the valve to return to the closed position before all
        of the product drawn in the pump chamber in step (1) is dispensed through the nozzle;
        (4) re-depressing and re-releasing pressure on the actuator sequentially one or more times until all
        of the product drawn in the pump chamber in step (1) is dispensed through the nozzle; and
        (5) repeating steps (1) through (4) to draw addition amounts of the product from the interior
       volume of the container and to dispense the additional amounts of the product through the nozzle;
wherein, during the duration when the product is dispensed from the container, the power assembly does
        not rotate relative to the container, and
wherein the power assembly is never rotated relative to the container in a direction opposite the one
       direction of rotation in step (1).

                   ONE TURN ACTUATED DURATION SPRAY PUMP MECHANISM
        Technical Field:
                The present invention relates to dispensers, specifically to duration spray dispensers
   5    that are energized mechanically and pressurized by a non-chemical means.
       Background Art:
                Both chemically driven and mechanically operated spray dispensers have been
       in use for many years and are still popular due to their convenience. However, aerosol
 10    dispensers that use chemical propellants have come under increasing scrutiny and restrictions
       are being imposed upon them due to their adverse impact upon the environment as well as the
      hazards associated with handling them and related insurance issues, Also, conventional non
      chemical mechanical spray dispensers are typically unfavorably compared with chemically
      driven aerosols because they are bulky and commonly require multiple steps in theiroperation,
 15   making them difficult to operate, especially by persons suffering from diseases or disorders
      such as arthritis. They also require a large number of parts and a large amount of material to
      produce them, which due to the increasing cost of energy makes them prohibitively expensive
      to manufacture. This, in turn, makes them too costly for use at the lower price range of
      consumer products. Moreover, there is a general reluctance to change from the pressurized
20   propellant-driven aerosol systems including bag in a can or piston in a can devices.
               Some mechanically operated aerosol devices incorporate storage chambers that require
     a step in which a metered amount of product must first be obtained and then transferred into a
     power chamber that provides the pressure for dispensing the product over a certain duration.
     These types of devices are energy inefficient and degrade over time and or usage, as well as
25   being too costly due to their exotic material stmcture and dynamic nature for use with a range
     of desirable products that currently use finger pumps or chemical aerosol valves. Bag in a can
     devices are complex systems that do not have all the attributes of chemical aerosol delivery.
               By way of example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,387,833 and 4,423,829 exhibit some of the above
     shortcomings.

     manipulation to deliver product as a spray. U.S. patents 4,167,041, 4,174,052, 4,174,055, and

             Despite the efforts of such devices as shown in the
   remains a need for a more convenient to use, less expensive, and compact
                                                                                  dispense product

   comparably to the chemically energized dispensers in common use. Specifically,
10 would be desirable to have a one turn actuated duration spray pump delivery system
   that is free of the disadvantages seen in conventional chemical and mechanically
   energized aerosol dispensers.
   Summary of the Disclosure:
15           The present invention is a duration spray dispenser that, among a variety of
                                                                                      eliminates
   features, does not rely upon chemical propellants for its operation, that
   the need for the charging chamber technology used in conventional mechanically
                                                                  steps required to operate
   operated aerosol dispensers, that reduces the multiple
   conventional delivery systems, that is close in convenience to chemically energized
20 dispenser systems, and/or that has a size comparable to that of conventional finger
   and trigger- actuated pumps.
                                                                                             or neck
             The mechanically actuated dispenser of the invention provides a neck
   finish with a grippable portion(s), including for products that currently utilize finger
                                                                             parts in single
   pumps, and has a number of parts comparable to the number of
25 stroke pumps. It also provides longer duration sprays than conventional
   mechanically energized dispensers.
             The duration spray dispenser of the invention comprises a power assembly that
   can be attached to a container of product to obtain a duration discharge of the product upon a
                                                                           and ready it for
   single turn or partial turn of an actuator to pressurize product
                                                                                    means such as
30 dispensing. The power assembly can be used with various energy storage
                                                                           when the actuator is
   springs, gases or elastics to exert pressure on product to be dispensed
    tumed.
                                                     2

               The power assembly comprises a rotatable actuator sleeve connected through a drive
     means with a piston so that rotation of the actuator sleeve causes the piston to reciprocate in a
     first direction to draw product from the container and into a pump chamber. Reciprocation of
                                                                                                   piston
     the piston in the first direction stores energy in an energy storage means that acts on the
  5  to bias it in a second direction opposite to the first direction to pressurize the product in the
                                                                                              of product
     pump chamber. A stem valve has a normally closed position that blocks discharge
     from the pump chamber, and an open position permitting discharge of product. A reciprocal
     actuator is connected with the stem valve to move it to its open position when the actuator is
     depressed. As product is depleted from the pump chamber the energy storage means pushes
10   the piston back to an at-rest position to ready it for another dispensing cycle. An escapement
     mechanism connected in the drive means also is operated by depression of the actuator to
     disengage the drive means so that movement of the piston in the second direction does not
     cause movement of the actuator sleeve.
              The.drive means comprises a clutch disc connected to be rotated byyotation of the
15   actuator sleexe, a drive screw connected with the clutch disc through interengaged gear teeth so
     that the drive screw is rotated by the clutch disc, and a piston housing connected to be
    reciprocated when the drive screw is rotated. The piston is carried by the piston housing for
    reciprocation in a cylinder cup, and with the cylinder cup defines the pump chamber.
              The escapement mechanism includes the clutch disc, the interengaged gear teeth
20  between the clutch disc and the drive screw, and the actuator. When the actuator is depressed
    it reciprocates the clutch disc away from the drive screw and disengages the gear teeth.
              Interengaged helical threads between the drive screw and piston housing, and axial
    grooves and splines between the exterior of the piston housing and the cylinder cup, cause the
    piston housing and piston to reciprocate from a first, at-rest position to a second position to
25  draw product from the container and into the pump chamber when the actuator sleeve is
    rotated. This motion of the piston also stores energy in the energy storage means that exerts
    pressure on the product drawn into the pump chamber. In the particular example disclosed
    herein, a full charge of the product to be dispensed can be drawn into the pump chamber by
    rotation of the actuator sleeve through only about 360', but if desired the system can be
30  designed to obtain a full charge of product to be dispensed when the actuator sleeve is rotated
    through a smaller angle, or through a larger angle if desired. Further, the actuator sleeve can be
    rotated through less than a full turn to obtain less than a full charge of product to be dispensed.

    product from the container.
                                                                                              piston
            The pump mechanism 12 comprises a tubular piston 20 carried by a cylindrical
    housing 30 for reciprocation of the piston in a pump chamber 40 in the lower end of a cylinder
    cup 50 attached to a container cap 60 that is secured to the upper end of container C. The
10  bottom end of the cylinder cup 50 contains a one-way ball check valve 150 connected with a
    dip tube 151 to permit flow of product from the dip tube and into the pump chamber but
    prevent reverse flow from the pump chamber back into the dip tube.
            As seen best in Figs. 3-5 and 7-13, the upper end of the piston housing 30 is slidably
    received in a first cylijAdrical wall61 extending upwardly from the inner margin of a first
15  annular wall 62 on the container cap 60, and the upper end of the cylinder cup 50 is threaded to
    a second cylindrical wall63 depending from the outer margin of the annular wall62. A third
    cylindrical wall64 depending from the outer margin of a second annular wall65 vertically
    offset and radially outwardly spaced from the first annular wall is threaded onto the upper end
    of the container to secure the container cap to the container. A radially inturned flange 66 on
20  the upper end of the first cylindrical wall 61 extends inwardly over the upper end of the piston
    housing to help retain it assembled to the container cap, and an actuator sleeve retaining flange
    67 extends outwardly from the top of the container cap above the depending cylindrical wall 64
    for engaging detents on an actuator sleeve to retain it assembled to the container cap as
    described hereinafter. An outer skirt 68 depends from the outer edge of annular wall65 in
25  outwardly spaced relation to depending wall64. The outer surface of the skirt is substantially
    flush with the outer surface of the container and provides a smooth outer finish to the
    dispenser. A vent gasket 160 is engaged between the second annular wall65 of the container
    cap and the upper end of the container to vent the container as product is depleted from it.
            The piston housing and piston are caused to reciprocate by a drive screw 70 extended
30  coaxially into the piston housing. As seen best in Figs. 18-21, the drive screw has a bore 71
    extending axially therethrough and a radially outwardly extending annular flange 72 on its

    position before the clutch disc and drive screw are re-engaged, thereby ensuring
    actuator sleeve will not be caused to rotate by the piston during its return movement to its at
 5  rest position. Full release of the actuator enables the drive screw to again engage with the
    clutch disc.
             The common pump mechanism used in all embodiments of the disclosure requires only
    one turn or a partial turn of the actuator sleeve, which can be either left or right in design.
    Turning of the actuator sleeve causes the piston to move upwardly in the pump cylinder to
10  draw product into the pump chamber and to store energy in the energy storage means. Of
    significance is the fact that depression of the actuator to open the stem valve and dispense
                                                                                    the piston and the
   product from the pump chamber also disengages the drive means between
    actuator sleeve so that the piston can return to its at-rest position without causing rotation of the
    actuator sleeve.
15           Any one of several different types of'energy storage means can be adapted to the
   common pump mechanism, including a spring mechanism as shown and described herein, or a
                                                                                               in
   pneumatic pressure mechanism or an elastic mechanism as illustrated and described
                                                                                             of which is
   applicant's copending patent application serial number 11/702,734, the disclosure
   incorporated in full herein by reference. Each would produce the same results, but by being
20 able to employ different energy storage means certain functional advantages can be obtained.
   For instance, a different energy storage means could be selected depending upon the range of
   pressure and force desired or needed to suit various viscosities of product.
             With a pneumatic energy storage means, the initial at-rest pressure can easily be varied
   to suit particular requirements. With the spring loaded device, a new spring must be supplied
25 to change the biasing force. Corresponding changes to the cylinder bore and piston diameter
   could also be made.
             As can be seen, there is substantial flexibility provided by the dispensing system
   described herein without having to design and/or develop a completely new system for a given
   range of products. Also, the force mechanism may be employed with conventional
30 mechanically operated pumps or triggers, reducing overall costs and eliminating the need to
   construct completely new systems. Although venting is required with the embodiments
   presented, airless systems may be employed. As can be understood, the present disclosure

   provides a convenience comparable to conventional aerosol
    described herein there is no need to repeatedly pump an actuator and experience finger fatigue
                                                                             provide a duration spray
   just to get short spurts of product. The embodiments described herein
    and a convenience not available to date at an affordable price.

            21.     A power assembly for obtaining duration discharge of product from a container,
   said power assembly comprising:
            a rotatable actuator sleeve mounted for rotation on said container;
            drive means connected between said actuator sleeve and a piston so that rotation of the
 5 actuator sleeve causes the piston to reciprocate in a first direction to draw product from the
   container and into a pump chamber;
            energy storage means connected with the piston so that reciprocation of the piston in
   the first direction stores energy in the energy storage means, said energy storage means acting
   on the piston to bias it in a second direction opposite to the first direction to pressurize product
10 in the pump chamber;
            a stem valve having a normally closed position that blocks discharge of product from
   the pump chamber, and an open position permitting discharge of product;
            a reciprocal actuator connected with the stem valve to move it to its open position
   when the actuator is depressed; and
15          an escapement mechanism connected in the drive means, said escapement mechanism
   operated by depression of the actuator to disengage the drive means so that movement of the
   piston in the second direction does not cause movement of the actuator sleeve.
            22.     A power assembly as claimed in claim 21, wherein:
            said drive means comprises a clutch disc connected to be rotated by rotation of the
   actuator sleeve, a drive screw connected with the clutch disc through interengaged gear teeth so
   that the drive screw is rotated by the clutch disc, and a piston housing connected to be
 5 reciprocated when the drive screw is rotated, said piston being carried by the piston housing.
            23.     A power assembly as claimed in claim 22, wherein:
            said escapement mechanism includes the clutch disc, the interengaged gear teeth
   between the clutch disc and the drive screw, and the actuator, said actuator being connected
   with the clutch disc to reciprocate the clutch disc away from the drive screw and disengage the
 5 gear teeth when the actuator is depressed.
                                                     25

          24.     A power assembly as claimed in claim 23, wherein:
          said piston housing is reciprocal in a cylinder cup, said piston and cylinder cup defining
   said pump chamber; and
          interengaged helical threads between the drive screw and piston housing, and axial
5 grooves and splines between the exterior of the piston housing and an interior surface of the
  cylinder cup, cause the piston housing and piston to reciprocate from a first, at-rest position to
  a second position to draw product from the container and into the pump chamber when the
  actuator sleeve and drive screw are rotated.
          25.     A power assembly as claimed in claim 24, wherein:
          actuator return spring means is engaged with said clutch disc to bias it in a direction to
  engage the gear teeth on said clutch disc with the gear teeth on said drive screw, and to return
  said actuator to an un-depressed position.
          26.     A power assembly as claimed in claim 25, wherein:
          said actuator return spring means comprises a coil spring engaged beneath said clutch
  disc.
          27.     A power assembly as claimed in claim 25, wherein:
          an actuator socket is connected between said actuator and said clutch disc;
          said drive screw has an annular flange lying between said actuator socket and said
  clutch disc; and
5         said actuator return spring means comprises leaf spring means integrally formed with
  said drive screw and acting between said drive screw and said actuator socket.
