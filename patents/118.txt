DIESEL FUEL COMPOSITION, COMPRISING COMPONENTS BASED ON
BIOLOGICAL RAW MATERIAL, OBTAINED                          BY HYDROGENATING
AND DECOMPOSING FATTY ACIDS.
TECHNICAL FIELD
This application is a divisional       of Australian Application No. 2015205854,
Australian Application No. 2010200726 and Australian Patent No. 2003258753, the
disclosures of which are deemed to be incorporated herein by reference in their
entirety.
The present invention relates to a fuel composition for diesel engines, comprising
components based on animal fat, diesel components based on crude oil and/or
fractions from Fischer-Tropsch process, and optionally components containing
oxygen.
PRIOR ART
Currently used fuels for diesel engines mainly contain components from crude oil.
The aim of the climate agreement of Kyoto is to eliminate detrimental influences due
to human activities on the atmosphere, and thus on the climate. The EU has agreed
on reducing emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases by
eight per cent until 2010, starting from the levels of 1990. One of the objects of the
EU agricultural policy is to find uses for agricultural overproduction, and to increase
the self-sufficiency for fuels. Accordingly, an EU directive is being prepared,
demanding that at least two per cent of the petrol and diesel fuel consumed in 2005
should be of biological origin. It is anticipated that one of the requirements of this
directive is to increase the proportion of biocomponents to about six per cent until
2010. The directive will be validated in all EU countries in the near future.
At the moment, the most common component of biological origin in fuels is rapeseed
oil methyl ester, referred to as RME. RME is either used as such or as a mixture with
fuels. Drawbacks of RME are its poor miscibility with diesel fuels, and, in
3480795vl

                                             2
comparison to a conventional         diesel fuel (EN 590), particularly under low
temperature conditions, its poor storage stability and poor performance at low
temperatures. Moreover, it causes engine fouling and increases emissions of nitrogen
oxides (NO,). A by-product of the production process of RME is glycerol, which
may become a problem when high amounts of the product are produced. Esters of
other vegetable oils may be produced in similar manner, and methyl esters of fatty
acids are generally known as FAMEs (fatty acid methyl ester). These FAMEs may
be used in similar applications as the rapeseed oil methyl ester, but they also have a
negative effect on the quality of the diesel fuel, particularly with respect to the
performance thereof at low temperatures, and in addition, the use thereof in fuels
increases the emissions of nitrogen oxides. In some cases FAME and RME cause
higher particle emissions and smoke development of the cold driven engine.
Vegetable oils and animal fats may be processed to decompose the ester and/or fatty
acid structure and to saturate the double bonds of the hydrocarbon chains, thus
obtaining about 80 to 85 % of n-paraffin product relative to the mass of the starting
material. This product may be directly mixed with a diesel fuel, but a problem with
the fuel so produced is its poor performance at low temperatures. In addition, n
paraffins having a carbon number of fatty acids are waxy with a high solidification
point, typically above +10 'C, thus limiting the use of these compounds in diesel
fuels at least at low temperatures.
 WO 2001049812 discloses a method for producing a diesel fuel with a molar ratio of
iso-paraffins to n-paraffins of at least 21:1. In the method, a feed stock containing at
least 50 % of Cio-paraffins is contacted with a catalyst in the isomerisation reaction
zone.
 WO 2001012581 discloses a method for producing methyl esters useful as biological
diesel fuel, wherein mixtures of fatty acids and triglycerides are esterified in one
phase. In this method, a solution is formed from fatty acids, triglycerides, alcohol,
acid catalyst and co-solvents at a temperature below the boiling point of the solution.
A co-solvent is used in amounts to provide a single phase then the solution is
maintained for a period of time sufficient for the acid catalyzed esterification of the
3480795vl

                                             3
fatty acids to take place. Thereafter, the acid catalyst is neutralised, a base catalyst is
added to transesterify the triglycerides, and finally, the esters are separated from the
solution. Thus a biofuel containing esters is obtained, having a glycerol content of
less than 0,4 % by weight.
US 6,174,501 presents a method for producing oxidized diesel fuel of biological
origin. This oxidized biological diesel fuel comprises a mixture of transesterified
triglycerides.
FI 100248 describes a two-step process for producing middle distillate from
vegetable oil by hydrogenating fatty acids of the vegetable oil, or triglycerides, to
give n-paraffins, and then by isomerising the n-paraffins to give branched-chain
paraffins. A published foreign counterpart of this patent is patent application SE
9700149, which has matured into patent SE 520633.
Any gases, liquid droplets and solid particles present in the atmosphere in amounts
being hazardous to human health and/or having a detrimental effect on animals,
plants and different materials, are considered as air pollutants. Air pollution mainly
originates from three main emission sources, i.e. the industry, energy production, and
traffic.
The harmfulness of particle emissions is caused by the substances and compounds
they carry, such as heavy metals and other carcinogenic and mutagenic compounds.
Particles present in exhaust gases are small and thus hazardous to health.
Greenhouse gases allow for the penetration of the radiation from the sun to reach the
earth, preventing, however, the thermal radiation from escaping from the earth back
to space. They thus contribute to the warming of the earth. One of the most
significant greenhouse gases is carbon dioxide released, for instance, during the
combustion of fossil fuels.
Nitrogen oxides are acidifying compounds. This acidification may, for instance, lead
to plant damages and species changes in surface waters. Nitrogen oxides may also

react with oxygen to give ozone. This phenomenon contributes particularly to air
quality in cities.
As the above teachings indicate, there is a need for a high quality fuel composition
for diesel engines containing components of biological origin and also meeting the
quality requirements for diesel fuels under low temperature operation conditions.
Moreover, the fuel should be more environmentally friendly than prior art solutions.
It would be advantageous       to provide a more environmentally friendly fuel
composition for diesel engines containing components of biological origin, and also
meeting the quality requirements for diesel fuels under low temperature conditions.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
It was surprisingly found that the diesel fuel composition of the invention, containing
components of biological origin, also meets the quality requirements for diesel fuels
under low temperature conditions. The composition of the diesel fuel of the invention
comprises: a) 0.1- 9 9 % by volume of a component or a mixture of components
produced from biological raw material originating from animals, or both animals and
plants, or originating from animals, plants and/or fish, by hydrogenating and

isomerising the hydrocarbons to give iso-paraffins;        b) 0-20 % by volume of
components containing oxygen selected from the group consisting of aliphatic
alcohols, ethers, fatty acid esters, water and mixtures containing the same; both
components a) and b) being mixed as an emulsion with or dissolved in diesel
components based on crude oil and/or fractions from a Fischer-Tropsch process.
Said components a) and b) are mixed in diesel components based on crude oil and/or
in fractions from Fischer-Tropsch process by forming an emulsion with or by
dissolving said components in diesel components based on crude oil and/or fractions
from Fischer-Tropsch process.
Preferably the composition of the invention comprises: a) 5-80% by volume of a
component or a mixture of components produced from biological raw material
originating from animals, or both animals and plants, by hydrogenating and
decomposing fatty acids and/or fatty acid esters to give hydrocarbons and
isomerising the hydrocarbons to give iso-paraffins; b) 0-20% by volume of
components containing oxygen selected from the group consisting of aliphatic
alcohols, ethers, fatty acid esters, water and mixtures containing the same; both
components a) and b) being mixed as an emulsion with or dissolved in diesel
components based on crude oil and/or fractions from Fischer-Tropsch process.
More preferably the composition of the invention comprises: a) 10-80% by volume
of a component or a mixture of components produced from biological raw material
originating from animals, or both animals and plants, by hydrogenating and
decomposing fatty acids and/or fatty acid esters to give hydrocarbons and

isomerising the hydrocarbons to give iso-paraffins; b) 0-20% by volume of
components containing oxygen selected from the group consisting of aliphatic
alcohols, ethers, fatty acid esters, water and mixtures containing the same; both
components a) and b) being mixed as an emulsion with or dissolved in diesel
components based on crude oil and/or fractions from Fischer-Tropsch process.
Most preferably the composition of the invention comprises: a) 10-80% by volume
of a component or a mixture of components produced from biological raw material
originating from animals, or both animals and plants, by hydrogenating and
decomposing fatty acids and/or fatty acid esters to give hydrocarbons and
isomerising the hydrocarbons to give iso-paraffins; b) 1-20% by volume of
components containing oxygen selected from the group consisting of aliphatic
alcohols, ethers, fatty acid esters, water and mixtures containing the same; both
components a) and b) being mixed as an emulsion with or dissolved in diesel
components based on crude oil and/or fractions from Fischer-Tropsch process.
It was generally thought that products based on animal origin, as well as products
based on recycled fats, could not be used in diesel fuels. These products were
expected to contain high amounts of sulphur-, nitrogen- and metal-containing
impurities, which would weaken the quality of the composition and make their
processing very difficult. This, however, turns out not to be true.
The biological based fuel compositions of the current invention have remarkably
lower "green house emissions" than the corresponding crude oil based products. The
animal- and fish-based fuel compositions of the current invention also have
significantly   improved    performance    ability  under    cold   conditions. These
compositions may have a turbidity point of lower than 00 C, preferably lower than
 100 C and more preferably lower than -20'C. These compositions may have a
turbidity point of even -30'C or lower while simultaneously having a cetane number
of 60 or higher. This differs markedly from the turbidity points presented in SE
9700149, which are considerably higher.

The biological raw material originating from animals, containing fatty acids and/or
fatty acid esters, is processed to yield the biological component of the present
application.    Said biological     component    is obtained   by   hydrogenating   and
decomposing fatty acids and/or fatty acid esters to give hydrocarbons having carbon
numbers of 6-24, typically n-paraffins as the product having a carbon number of 12
24, and isomerising the hydrocarbons, typically n-paraffins thus obtained to give
isoparaffins. Typically, after the isomerisation, the iso-paraffin content is more than
20 wt-%, preferably more than 30 wt-% and more preferably more than 50 wt-%. In
one embodiment of the invention the iso-paraffin content may be more than 60 wt-%
or even more than 70 wt-% in said biological component.
In embodiments, the isomerised biological component (i.e. the biodiesel fuel
composition) has a weight ratio of iso-paraffins to n-paraffins of less than 21:1,
preferably less than any one or 20:1, 19:1. 18:1, 17:1, 16:1, 15:1, 14:1, 13:1, 12:1,
 11:1, 10:1, 9:1, 8:1, 7:1, 6:1 or 5:1. Such values may include ranges of, for example,
20:1 to 5:1 or 15:1 to 5:1.
Examples of suitable biological raw materials are animal-based fats such as lard,
tallow, train oil, and fats contained in milk, as well as recycled animal fats of the
food industry and mixtures of the above.
The fuel composition can optionally further comprise a component or mixture of
components produced from biological raw material originating from plants. The
biological raw material originating from plants can be selected from various
vegetable oils, and mixtures thereof containing fatty acids and/or fatty acid esters.
Examples of suitable materials are wood-based and other plant-based fats and oils
such as rapeseed oil, colza oil, canola oil, tall oil, sunflower oil, soybean oil,
hempseed oil, olive oil, linseed oil, mustard oil, palm oil, peanut oil, castor oil,
coconut oil, as well as fats contained in plants bred by means of gene manipulation,
and recycled plant sourced fats of the food industry.

The basic component of a typical animal fat is triglyceride ie. a triester of glycerol
and three fatty acid molecules having the structure presented in the following
formula I:
                                   0

where R1. R,. and R3 are hydrocarbon chains, and R1 , Rz, and R3 may be saturated or
unsatunted C6 - C24 alkyl goups. The fatty acid composition may vary considerably
in biological raw materials of different origin
n-paraffis. iso-paraffns or mixtures thereof produced Fom the biological raw
material may be used as a diesel fuel component in accordance with the properties
desired for the diesel fuel. Fractions from Fiicher-Tropsch-process typically contain
high levels of n-paraffin        and, optionally, they may        be    somerised either
simultaneously during the processing of the component of biological origin or
separately tfherefromn. or they may be used as such.
In embodiments, the invention resides in a biodiesel fuel composition comprising at
least one isomerized biological component produced by a process comprising:
a)        providing a feed stream of fatty acids and/or fatty acid esters derived from an
animal and/or fish source;
b)        hydrodeoxygenating the feed stream to form n-paraffirs; and
c)        isomerizing he n-paraffins to form iso-paraffins.
Suitably, the n-paraffins fonned in step b) have carbon numbers only between 12-24.
Preferably, the composition has a turbidity point lower than -20 C.

It will be appreciated that the process described is not a cracking or hydrothermal
cracking process but rather one involving isomerization.
The biological component may be produced, for instance, with a process comprising
at least two steps and optionally utilizing the counter-current operation principle.
Before the first step the feedstock may optionally be prehydrogenated to saturate
double bonds of the hydrocarbon chain, at a temperature of 100-400'C, preferably at
 150-250'C. In the first hydrodeoxygenation step of the process, carried out at a
temperature of 200-400'C, preferably at 250-350'C, optionally running counter
current, the structure of the biological raw material is broken, compounds containing
oxygen, nitrogen, phosphor and sulphur as well as light hydrocarbons as gas are
removed,    and thereafter, olefinic bonds are hydrogenated. In the second,
isomerisation step of the process, optionally running counter-current, isomerisation is
carried out to give branched hydrocarbon chains, thus improving the low temperature
properties of the paraffins.
Biological raw material selected from plant oils and fats, animal fats, and mixtures
thereof, containing fatty acids and/or fatty acid esters, is used as the feed stock.
High quality hydrocarbon component of biological origin, particularly useful as a
component of a diesel fuel, as an iso-paraffinic solvent and as a lamp oil, is obtained
as the product having a high cetane number that may even be higher than 70. A
component with a turbidity point lower than -30'C and a cetane number higher than
60 can also be achieved. Further, said hydrocarbon component of biological origin is
free of aromatics. The content of naphthenes in said hydrocarbon component may be
less than 30 wt-%, preferably less than 10 wt-%, more preferably less than 5 wt-% or
even less than 1 wt-%. Both aromatics and naphthenes present in the hydrocarbon
product decrease the cetane number and increase cold smoke during start up of the
engine. The process can be adjusted according to the desired cetane number and
turbidity point.
Advantages of the diesel fuel composition of the present invention include superior
performance at low temperatures and an excellent cetane number compared to

                                             10
solutions of prior art using FAME-based components like RME. Problems associated
with the performance at low temperatures may be avoided by isomerising waxy n
paraffins having a carbon number comparable with that of fatty acids to give iso
paraffins. The properties of the products thus obtained are excellent, especially with
respect to diesel applications, the n-paraffins typically have cetane numbers higher
than 70, and iso-paraffins higher than 60, and thus they have an improving effect on
the cetane number of the diesel pool, which clearly makes them more valuable as
diesel components. Moreover, the turbidity point of the isomerised product may be
adjusted to the desired level, for example below -30'C, whereas the corresponding
value is about 00 C for RME and more than +15'C for n-paraffins. Table 1 below
compares the properties of an isomerised biological component, RME, and a
commercial diesel fuel.

Tallow is a generic term used for fats obtained from cow, sheep (mutton or lamb) or
reindeer. The tallow used in this table was obtained from Atria Finland Ltd, a Finnish
meat producing company.
Fouling of engines is considerably diminished and the noise level is clearly lower
when using isomerised biological component fuel composition in comparison with
similar prior art fuels of biological origin containing FAME components, and further,
the density of the composition is lower. The composition does not require any
modifications of the automobile technology or logistics. Higher energy content per
unit volume may be mentioned as a further advantage compared to RME.

The properties of the diesel fuel composition of biological origin according to the
invention correspond to those of a high quality diesel fuel based on crude oil      A
composition free of aromatics can be obtained and, in contrast to FAME, it leaves no
impurity residues.
Nitrogen oxide emissions due to the fuel composition of the invention are lower that
those from a similar FAME-based product, and further, the particle emissions are
clearly lower, and the carbon portion of the particles is smaller. These significant
improvements in the emissions of the fuel composition of biological origin are
environmentally very important.

This Table presents the surprisingly improved results obtained for the instant
invention under cold conditions. That is, the animal fat-based fuel composition of the
instant invention has excellent cold properties         when compared      with those
compositions presented in SE 9700149. Specifically, the lower turbidity point of the
animal fat-based fuel composition of the instant invention affords less fuel filter
plugging during cold weather operations.

Also, the cold filter plugging point (CFPP) indicates that the animal fat-based fuel
composition of the instant invention provides trouble-free flow in fuel systems at
ambient temperatures about 20'C lower as compared to the cited prior art. Most
surprisingly these improved performance qualities are obtained without a decrease in
the fuel ignition delay characteristics as evidenced by the instant invention's high
cetane number, which is comparable to that of the prior art. It was generally thought
that one cannot improve cold flow properties to these low levels without decreasing
the fuel ignition delay.
The invention will now be illustrated by means of the following examples without
intending to limit the scope thereof.
EXAMPLES
Example 1
Manufacture of animal fat based component:
The hydrogenation of animal fat was carried out in a fixed bed tube reactor. The
animal fat was Atria tallow as used earlier in table 1. The hydrogenation reaction was
carried out in the presence of NiMo catalyst under a pressure of 50 bars, with WHSV
of 1 -2 1/h and at a reaction temperature from 250 to 300'C. Hydrogen to oil ratio
was 500 - 1500 normal liters H 2 per liter oil fed. The hydrogenated product oil
contained no oxygen compounds.
Isomerisation of the above-obtained hydrogenated animal fat was carried out in a
fixed bed tube reactor in the presence of Pt-SAPO-catalyst under a pressure of 40
bars, with WHSV of 1.5 1/h and at a reaction temperature of 328'C. Hydrogen to oil
ratio was 300 normal liters H 2 per liter oil fed.
Low temperature properties of the obtained animal fat based component are
presented in the Table 3 below.
