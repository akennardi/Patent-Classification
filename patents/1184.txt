                              ABSTRACT OF THE DISCLOSURE
        A respiratory mask assembly for delivering breathable gas to a patient includes a
frame and a cushion. The cushion has a non-face contacting portion structured to be
connected to the frame, a face-contacting portion structured to engage the patient's face, and
a central portion that interconnects the non-face contacting portion and the face contacting
portion. The frame may be structured to allow a forehead support to assume multiple
positions, to compensate for replacement cushions that may have a different profile, shape or
size. The cushion is structured to compensate for variations in strap tension, treatment
pressure and/or movement of the patient. Headgear may be provided with a strap assembly in
which one or more straps is provided with selectively adjustable elasticity or extensibility that
may be automatically changed in dependence of treatment pressure and/or treatment type.

                                 FIELD OF THE INVENTION
        [0002]      The present invention relates to a cushion for a respiratory mask assembly
used for providing ventilatory support, e.g., for treatment of Sleep Disordered Breathing
(SDB) with Non-invasive Positive Pressure Ventilation (NPPV).
                            BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
        [0003]      The use of NPPV for treatment of SDB such as Obstructive Sleep Apnea
(OSA) was pioneered by Sullivan (see U.S. Patent No. 4,944,310). Apparatus for the
treatment of SDB involves a blower which delivers a supply of air at positive pressure to a
patient interface via a conduit. The patient interface may take several forms, such as a nasal
mask assembly and a nasal and mouth mask assembly. Patients typically wear a mask
assembly while sleeping to receive the NPPV therapy.
        [0004]      Mask assemblies typically comprise a rigid shell or frame and a soft face
contacting cushion. The cushion spaces the frame away from the patient's face. The frame
and cushion define a cavity which receives the nose or nose and mouth. The frame and
cushion are held in position on the patient's face by a headgear assembly. The headgear
assembly typically comprises an arrangement of straps which pass along both sides of the
patient's face to the back or crown of the patient's head.
        [0005]      U.S. Patent No. 5,243,971 (Sullivan and Bruderer) describes a nasal mask
assembly for Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) having a ballooning/molding seal
that conforms with the patient's nose and facial contours. The mask assembly has a face
contacting portion mounted to a shell which is sized and shaped to overfit the nose region of
the patient. The face-contacting portion is in the form of a distendable membrane which is
molded from an elastic plastics material. The distendable membrane and the shell together
                                                 1

define a chamber. Pressurized gas admitted to the chamber causes the membrane to distend
outwardly from the patient's face. The contents of this patent are hereby incorporated by
reference.
         [0006]      U.S. Patent No. 6,112,746 (Kwok et al.) describes a nasal mask assembly
and a mask cushion therefor. The cushion comprises a substantially triangularly shaped
frame from which extends a membrane. The frame has a scalloped edge by which the
cushion is affixed to a mask body. The membrane has an aperture into which the patient's
nose is received. The membrane is spaced away from the rim of the frame, and its outer
surface is of substantially the same shape as the rim. U.S. Patent No. 6,513,526 (Kwok et al.)
describes such a cushion for use with a full face mask. The entire contents of these patents
are hereby incorporated by reference.
         [0007]      In a traditional mask assembly including a cushion, a seal is formed
between the cushion and the face of a patient as the result of a contact force which acts along
a contact line of the cushion. The contact force typically is a function of tension in the
headgear straps which acts through the frame of the mask assembly, the walls of the cushion
and the seal-forming portion of the cushion. In a traditional mask assembly, the frame
defines a cavity or volute adapted to receive at least a portion of the nose, with the cushion
forming a perimeter of the cavity. Thus, in use, the portion of the patient's face within the
cavity is exposed to air or breathable gas at positive pressure and hence receives a force as
the result of that positive pressure.
         [0008]      U.S. Patent No. 5,074,297 (Venegas) describes a respiratory mask
assembly for use with intermittent positive pressure breathing treatment which is said to
facilitate the formation and automatic adjustment of the seal between a patient's face and a
facial unit of the respiratory mask. The respirator mask assembly comprises a facial unit, an
expandable piston adjacent the facial unit and a rigid support structure attached to one end of
the piston, and an attachment mechanism for securing the mask assembly to a patient.
During the inspiration portion of the ventilation cycle a positive pressure is developed within
the mask assembly, causing the piston to expand. Because the attachment mechanism and the
support cooperate to resist significant expansion of the piston, a force is generated which
presses the facial unit against the patient's face and maintains an air tight seal. When pressure
within the mask unit decreases, the contact force on the facial unit is likewise decreased and
the seal is eliminated.
                                                  2

        [0009]      A common problem with prior art mask assemblies, such as the mask
assemblies taught by U.S. Patent Nos. 5,074,297, 5,243,971 and 6,112,746, is patient
comfort. Patients can develop sores and red marks on their faces after several hours use of a
mask assembly. The nasal bridge area of the patient's face has been identified as being
particularly sensitive.
        [0010]      Moreover, the face contacting portion may apply excessive pressure to the
wearer's face resulting in discomfort and possibly skin irritation. This can occur when the
face contacting portion is distorted beyond its normal range of elasticity to conform to certain
facial contours, thus requiring the application of excessive forces to obtain a seal. In some
cases, these excessive pressures and forces may cause the wearer's face to distort to conform
with the face contacting portion, which increases wearer discomfort, facial soreness and
ulceration.
        [0011]      Another common problem with prior art mask assemblies is buildup of
CO 2 in the mask cavity. Mask assemblies typically include a vent which allows the
continuous washout of exhaled gasses from the cavity. One factor affecting the washout of
exhaled gases is the dead space within the mask cavity.
        [0012]      Another common problem with these masks is a broken or ineffective seal.
for example, the mask may become dislodged if the wearer rolls over when sleeping, thereby
creating a drag force on the gas supply line which is transmitted to the mask and breaking the
seal between the mask and wearer. If a mask is used for the administration of Continuous
Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) treatment for the condition obstructive sleep apnea, such a
leak can result in a pressure supplied to the entrance of the wearer's airway that is below the
therapeutic value. Thus, treatment becomes ineffective.
        [0013]      Another problem with existing full face (oro-nasal) masks occurs when
wearers move their jaws during treatment, which often happens. As a result, air leaks are
created below the mouth from the mid-region extending to the region at the sides or corners
of the mouth.
        [0014]      To address these and other problems, the masks described in U.S. Non
Provisional Application No. 09/885,455 filed June 21, 2001, and U.S. Non-Provisional Patent
Application No 10/655,622, have been developed. One aspect common to these applications
includes the concept of a gusset section. However, there is perhaps at least a perception that
the gusset section is large in terms of its visual appearance, despite the benefits derived from
the gusset section.
                                                  3

         [0015]     There are a number of mask systems on the market today which do not
have one or more of the benefits of the masks described in these applications. Rather than
completely reconfigure the currently existing designs, it may be economically more desirable
to merely redesign only a portion the mask system, or component thereof, to take advantage
of one or more of the teachings and benefits offered by applicants' prior solutions.
                               SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
        [0016]      One aspect of the invention is directed towards a mask assembly having a
cushion that provides more comfort to the patient.
        [0017]      Another aspect of the invention is directed towards a mask assembly
having a cushion that controllably distributes facial contact pressure around the patient's face.
        [0018]      A further aspect is directed to a forehead support that can be moved to
accommodate facial cushions having different depths and/or profiles.
        [0019]      Another aspect of the invention is directed towards a mask assembly
having a cushion that controllably distributes facial contact forces around a contact line on
the patient's face. In one example, a gusset portion may be provided that is tailored to have
variable or varying widths. The gusset portion may be formed, profiled and sized with
varying widths. Alternatively, the profile or effective width can be changed using one or
more clamps provided along any portion of the cushion perimeter.
        [0020]      Another aspect of the invention is directed towards a mask assembly
which has minimal impingement of a patient's vision.
        [0021]      Another aspect of the invention is directed towards a mask assembly
having a cushion which has a low profile.
        [0022]      Another aspect of the invention is directed towards a mask assembly
which seals at a low pressure and which is comfortable at high pressures.
        [0023]      Another aspect of the invention is directed towards a mask assembly
having a cushion which provides reinforcement structure to regulate pressure distribution.
        [0024]      Another aspect of the invention is directed towards a mask assembly
providing additional footprint area and/or a spring section with a spring constant constructed
so that the forces on the face from the cushion are a function of the mask pressure and the
additional footprint area, and/or the spring constant of the spring section.
         [0025]     A further aspect of embodiments of the invention provides a full face mask
with a cushion that forms a stable and reliable seal with a wearer's face.
                                                 4

         [0026]     An additional aspect of embodiments of the invention provides a full face
mask that effectively seals the region directly below and/or to the sides of the lower lip.
        [0027]      A further aspect of embodiments of the invention provides a full face mask
that offers effective and comfortable sealing at relatively high pressures.
        [0028]      In one example, a respiratory mask assembly for delivering breathable gas
to a patient includes a frame to support one of at least first and second compliant patient
interfaces; and a forehead support adjustably mounted to the frame, wherein the forehead
support is structured and configured to be moved between a first position for use with the first
patient interface and a second position relative to the frame for use with a second patient
interface, whereby the forehead support maintains a horizontal offset distance with the first
and second patient interfaces which is substantially constant.
         [0029]     In another example, a cushion for a respiratory mask to deliver breathable
gas in a range of operating pressures to a patient includes a non-face contacting portion
connected to a frame; a face-contacting portion structured to form a contact seal with the
patient's face in use; and a central portion that interconnects the non-face contacting portion
and the face-contacting portion, the central portion being structured to automatically adjust a
component of force applied to the patient's face through the face-contacting portion in
accordance with operating pressure, while maintaining the contact seal throughout the range
of operating pressures.
         [0030]     Principles of these examples may be applied to any type of cushion for use
on a respiratory mask, including but not limited to silicone elastomer, gel, foam or any
combination thereof.
         [0031]     Principles of these examples may be applied to any type of respiratory
mask, including CPAP systems or non-positive ventilation masks, such as respirators.

apparent from the following detailed description when taken in conjunction with the
accompanying drawings, which are a part of this disclosure and which illustrate, by way of

             DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATED EMBODIMENTS
Upgradable Cushion/Forehead Connector System
        [0094]      Fig. 1 shows a respiratory mask assembly 10 that includes a frame 12 and
a cushion 14 that may be permanently or removably connected to the frame 12. A forehead
support 16 is movably mounted to an upper portion 13 of the frame 12. A headgear assembly
(not shown) can be removably attached to the frame 12 and/or forehead support 16 to
maintain the frame 12 and cushion 14 in a desired adjusted position on the patient's face. For
example, the headgear assembly may include a pair of upper and lower straps with the upper
straps removably connected to slotted connector structures 18 provided on the forehead
support 16 and the lower straps removably connected to slotted clip structures 20 provided on
the frame 12. The slotted connector structures 18 may be replaced with slotted clip
structures. The headgear assembly and frame 12 may be removably attached to one another
in any suitable manner.
        [0095]      In the illustrated embodiment, the mask assembly 10 is a nasal mask
structured to deliver breathable gas to a patient's nose. However, the mask assembly 10 may
                                                   9

be a mouth (oro) mask or the mask assembly may be a full-face (oro-nasal) mask. In another
alternative, the cushion could be replaced with a nozzle assembly, as taught in ResMed
Limited's. U.S. Non-provisional patent application no. 10/781,929, filed February 20, 2004,
incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
         [0096]     A swivel elbow assembly 22 is removably attached to a front portion of
the frame 12. The elbow assembly 22 is structured to be connected to a conduit that is
connected to a pressurized supply. The pressurized supply supplies pressurized breathable
gas through the conduit and elbow assembly 22 and into the cushion 14 for breathing by the
patient.
         [0097]     As compared to the aforementioned U.S. Non-Provisional Patent
Application No. 10/655,622, the mask assembly includes one main difference, which relates
to the upper portion 13 of the frame 12. All other aspects and components are similar to or
exactly as described in U.S. Non-Provisional Patent Application No. 10/655,622.
         [0098]     The mask assembly 10 may be provided with the ability to allow two or
more cushions 14 for use with frame 12. In particular, the upper portion 13 of the frame 12
includes first and second slots 30, 32 connected by a keyway 34. In Fig. 1, a pivot shaft 36,
which is provided in this example on each side of the forehead support 16, is positioned in the
second slot 32. This position is desirable for use with the cushion 14, which includes a gusset
portion 28, as the presence of the gusset portion 28 may increase a distance D measured from
the frame 12 (where it interfaces with non-face contacting portion 24 of the cushion 14) to
face-contacting portion 26 of the cushion 14.
         [0099]     In one form of the embodiment shown in Figs. 1 and 2, the mask assembly
is provided with two individual forehead supports 16, one for each of the two positions
shown therein. With the first forehead support, the shaft 36 is positioned further away from
the adjustment mechanism, e.g., a tongue and groove or ratchet mechanism, as shown in Fig.
1. With the second forehead support, as shown in Fig. 2, the shaft 36 is positioned closer to
the adjustment mechanism. In another form, the shaft 36 may be adjustably mounted with
respect to the adjustment mechanism (ratchet assembly). For example, shaft 36 could be
movably attached (e.g., via pivoting, sliding or the like) to a lower leg portion of the "T"
shaped forehead support 16, so as to allow movement of the shaft 36 relative to the ratchet
mechanism, for selective seating within one of the two slots 30 or 32. Alternatively, a
different retaining mechanism could be employed, such as a friction fit or screw thread, etc.
                                                10

         [00100]     As shown in Fig. 2A, forehead support 16 includes an adjustment
mechanism similar to that described in U.S. Patent No. 6,532,961, incorporated herein by
reference in its entirety. The adjustment mechanism in Figure 2A is slightly different than
that used in Figs. 1 and 2. However, one would recognize that the following teachings are
equally applicable to either adjustment mechanism. The forehead support includes structure
allowing movement between shaft 36 and main arm portion 36.1. In this embodiment shaft
36 is mounted on a movable arm portion 36.2, e.g., in a living hinge, joint, pivot, etc.
Movable arm portion 36.2 can move toward and away from main arm portion 36.1,
depending on whether shaft 36 is to be seated within slot 30 or 32. In this way, proper
engagement between teeth/recesses 36.4 and positioning pin 36.5 can be maintained. A
spring 36.3 or other resilient member may be provided to bias arm portion 36.2 towards or
away from main arm portion 36.1.
         [00101]     Referring back to the embodiment of Figs. 1 and 2, the position of the
shaft 36 can be changed from the second slot 32 to the first slot 30. For example, the
forehead support 16, along with each shaft 36, may be rotated in a clockwise direction (as
seen in Fig. 1) until the narrower dimension of each shaft 36 aligns with keyway 34. Upon
alignment, the forehead support 16 and shafts 36 can be moved, e.g., slid, in the direction
towards the first slot 30, until the full extent of the shaft 36 is located in the first slot 30.
Thereafter, the forehead support 16 along with each shaft 36 are rotated in a
counterclockwise sense until the forehead support 16 is in a position facing the patient's
forehead, in which position the wider side of each shaft 36 prevents its release from the first
slot as the key way 34 is more narrow than the wider side of each shaft 36.
         [00102]     Fig. 2 shows shaft 36 in position within the first slot 30. In addition, it can
be seen that the cushion 14 from Fig. 1 has been replaced with another cushion 14', which is
identical in all ways except the cushion 14' does not include a gusset. Instead, the cushion
14' may be a standard Mirage@ cushion available from ResMed, Ltd., modified to include a
non-face contacting side which will interface with frame 12 and cushion clips 38.
         [00103]     Without a gusset, cushion 14' has a dimension d which is less than
dimension D in Fig. 1. As such, the position of forehead support 16 relative to the upper
portion 13 of the frame 12 is changed, due to movement of the forehead support 16 and shaft
36 to the first slot 30. Therefore, the relative distance el and e2 between the cushion 40 of
forehead support 16 and the face-contacting portion 26 of the cushion 14, 14', respectively,
remains substantially constant. In other words, el and e2 (the horizontal offset between the
                                                  11

forehead support and the cushion) are substantially the same, even though the forehead
support 16 has been moved. Moreover, the forehead support 16 can be moved a distance dl,
which is approximately the same thickness of the gusset portion 28, or the difference between
D and d. Accordingly, the forehead cushion 40 and face-contacting portion 26 in each of
Figs. 1 and 2 will contact the patient in approximately the same location, such that the
positioning, fit and/or feel of the mask 10 with either of cushions 14, 14' is substantially the
same.
         [00104]     In this example, the two slots 30, 32 are arranged somewhat diagonally,
which in practice may also have the effect of changing the height h of the forehead support
16 relative to the cushion 14, 14'. In particular, the height HI between the forehead cushion
40 and the cushion 14 in Fig. 1 may be less than the height H2 between the forehead cushion
40 and the cushion 14' in Fig. 2. However, the heights HI and H2 can be dimensioned to be
the same, in which case, for example, the slots may be located horizontally side-by-side, or
the height H2 can be less than height HI, if desired, depending on application.
         [00105]     Moreover, the forehead support 16 can be moved between the slots 30, 32
for the purpose of changing the contact profile between the cushion 40 and the patient's
forehead, while keeping the same cushion, e.g., cushion 14 or cushion 14'. In other words, it
is not necessary to change the cushion and to make use of the added adjustability. To this
end, there are numerous arrangements which can allow the position of the forehead support
16 to be altered with respect to the upper portion 13 of the frame 12. Also, the number of
slots can be changed in accordance with the number of different positions which are
necessary to accommodate cushions having various depths D or d, or d to D. There may be a
predetermined number of fixed positions, e.g., three to five, or more, or there may be an
infinite number of positions made possible by a sliding arrangement, for example.
         [00106]     In one embodiment, the frame 12 may be sold with a Mirage@- type
cushion 14', in which case the cushion frame 16 would be positioned as shown in Fig. 2. If
preferred, the patient can upgrade to a gusseted cushion 14 as shown in Fig. 1, in which case
the shafts 36 would be repositioned from the second slots 32 into the first slots 30, as shown
in Fig. 1.
         [00107]     Fig. 3 shows a sample of a forehead support 42 which is slidable with
respect to an upper part 44 of a frame 12. In this example, the forehead support 42 is not
pivotable, rotatable or otherwise movable to change the angular attitude of the upper part 44
relative to the patient's forehead, although provision could be made for this as well. The
                                                 12

forehead support 42 is provided with a finger-operated push button 46 which is resiliently
urged or locked in a first position in which the forehead support 42 is prevented from moving
relative to the upper part 44 of frame 12. When the button 46 is depressed, the forehead
support 42 is free to move, or it can be spring biased to move towards and/or away from the
patient's forehead, to effect a relative change in position due to the different facial geometries
among patients, or to simply compensate for the change between a cushion with a gusset and
a cushion without a gusset or a cushion having a greater profile depth. The forehead support
42 may be supported and guided by a pair of pins or extensions 48 which are positioned
within slots 50 provided on the upper part 44 of frame 12. The push button 46 may be
associated with one or more tabs which can be selectively positioned in one of a plurality of
slots 52, in this case four slots. However, the cushion frame 16 and the upper part 44 can be
structured to be fixed relative to one another via friction, such that an infinite number of
relative positions can be achieved. The forehead support 16 may be provided with one or
more cushions 54.
         [00108]     Fig. 4 illustrates yet another embodiment of a mask, like that shown in Fig.
1, but which includes a push button arrangement to allow for horizontal movement of the
forehead support 16' relative to the patient's forehead, to accommodate for different cushion
depths or for patient's having differing facial geometries. Like elements have been used to
denote like parts.
Cushion Alternatives
         [00109]     Fig. 5 plots mask pressure (Pmask) versus contact force of the mask cushion
against the patient's face (Fcontact). A mask designer ideally wants to create a mask which falls
within a zone Z of comfort and seal. The zone Z is bounded on four sides. The upper and
lower sides represent maximum comfortable contact force and minimum contact force,
respectively. Below the minimum contact force, a proper seal will not be maintained, while
forces above the maximum comfortable contact force will be undesirable from the patient's
perspective. The left and right side borders of the zone Z represent the typical minimum and
maximum operating pressures of the mask, respectively. For example, the mask may operate
with pressures in the range of about 4-20 cm H 20, although other pressures are contemplated.
         [00110]     Line LI is the performance curve for one example of a mask described in
U.S. Application No. 09/885,455 or 10/655,622. The mask includes a cushion with a gusset
                                                   13

having an increased projected area Al, compared with the contact area A of the cushion on
the patient's face.
         [00111]     The cushion, e.g., the gusset, may include a spring portion to help maintain
the performance curve within the zone Z. The effect of the spring portion is to provide an
additional contact force at low mask pressures when the effect of the gusset portion is
insufficient to provide the minimum sealing force. As a result, the cushion maintains a seal
through the range of operating pressures. Moreover, the cushion represented by line LI falls
within the zone of comfort and seal Z throughout the range of operating pressures.
         [00112]     Thus, for example, by combining a gusset portion with a spring structure
in a cushion, a designer can tailor the contact force of the cushion such that it falls within the
zone of comfort and seal Z throughout the working range of pressure. The same principles
may be applied for different pressure ranges.
         [00113]     Further, the size of the zone Z may change (e.g., by changing the
maximum comfortable contact force) depending on a particular region of the patient's face.
For example, the maximum comfortable contact force may be reduced for a nasal bridge
region of the face. As a result, the cushion can be tailored for that particular region such that
it falls within the zone of comfort and seal Z throughout the range of operating pressures.
         [00114]     Another example is that the upper side of the zone Z is in fact a straight
line as this is the maximum force that the face can take without damage to the skin occurring.
However, the maximum force for which the user is comfortable may be below this line.
Indeed the upper side of the zone may be a sloping line, indicating a low maximum
comfortable force at low pressure leading up to a higher maximum comfortable force at high
pressures.
         [00115]     Although the cushion 14' in Fig. 2 does not include a gusset portion, it can
nonetheless be provided with structure and/or a configuration allowing it to incorporate one
or more features or advantages associated with a cushion having a gusset portion. In
particular, there are a number of masks currently on the market today which can be modified,
sometimes in minor ways, to achieve at least one or more of the benefits of a mask with a
gusset and/or spring portion. For example, currently existing mask systems can be modified
to keep the contact force within zone Z for a given pressure range and/or a specific portion of
the patient's face. In some cases, these modifications may not include the use of a gusset
and/or spring portion.
                                                  14

         [00116]     Fig. 6 illustrates a schematic view of a first cushion embodiment of the
present invention. A mask assembly 60 includes a frame 62 and a cushion 64. The cushion
may include a face contacting portion 65 that is adapted to contact with a portion of the
patient's face, or at least interact with the patient. Moreover, face contacting portion, as used
herein, does not require any contact with the patient's face so long as a sealed interface is
established with the patient's airways. Portion 65 includes a membrane 66 spaced above an
underlying rim 68. The face contacting portion 65 may be mounted on a concertina-type
connecting structure 70 that is configured or structured to provide a spring-like effect.
Connecting structure 70 forms a bridge or transition between the contacting portion 65 and
frame 62. For example, the connecting structure 70 may include a wire insert. Alternatively,
or in addition, the connecting structure 70 may comprise an elastomeric and/or a plastic
spring.
         [00117]     Fig. 7 shows a schematic view of another embodiment of a mask assembly
72 which includes a frame 74, and a cushion 76. The frame 74 includes a mount 78 provided
or fixed to an inside surface of the frame 74. The mount 78 includes a receiving aperture 80
to receive an end 82 of a spring 84, e.g., an elastomer spring. The end 82 may be in the form
of a ball joint which is received in aperture 80, which may be at least part sphere shaped.
End 82 is structured to pivot to allow face contacting portion 90 to move sideways relative to
frame 74, thereby increasing performance in the event the frame is "bumped." Spring 84 may
have a generally T-shape, with arms 86 extending laterally and having an end 88 provided or
connected to each side of face contacting portion 90. In this case, connecting structure 92
may be structured without a spring like effect, in which case the spring effect is supplied
solely by the springiness of spring 84. In an alternative, the connecting structure 92 may
include a spring wire or be made of a plastic or elastomeric spring, as described above. The
spring constants of the connecting structure 92 and the spring 84 should be coordinated to
provide the most optimum spring and dampening characteristics. Spring 84, e.g., arms 86,
may include one or more apertures 94 which allow for the passage of gas.
         [00118]     As shown in Fig. 7, connecting structure has generally fully developed
pleats or folds in connecting portion 92. However, the cushion need not be fully pleated. For
example, as shown in Fig. 7A, the connecting structure 92.1 includes gradual pleats that can
include indents that cause the cushion to fold under deformation force.
                                                   15

          [00119]    Fig. 8 shows a partial schematic view of an alternative embodiment. In
this embodiment, frame 96 includes a mount 98 having an aperture 100 to receive an end 102
of a spring member 108, like that described above.
          [00120]    Fig. 9 illustrates a schematic view of a mask assembly 110 including a
frame 112 and a cushion 114 provided to the frame 112. The cushion 114 includes a non
face contacting portion 116 oriented towards the frame 112, and a face contacting portion 118
having a membrane 120 and an underlying rim 122. The cushion 114 includes a central
portion 124 located between the non-face contacting and face contacting portions 116, 118 of
the cushion 114. The central portion 124 in this example includes an inverted portion 126
that extends inwardly towards the nose receiving cavity. Inverted portion 126 provides for a
similar level of flexibility and travel as an external gusset but covers less area on the face,
e.g., it has a smaller footprint or projected area, which is perceived as less obtrusive by the
patient. The inverted portion 126 may be provided with a wire spring embedded within the
wall thickness, or the inverted portion 126 may be made of a plastic or elastomeric material
having a spring constant that can be selected based on the desired operating characteristics.
Moreover, spring may have a fixed or variable spring rate.
          [00121]    The inverted portion 126 may include an internal spring member 128,
and/or an external spring member 130. The spring members can be made of plastic or metal.
The internal spring member 128 may be a compression spring, while the external spring 130
may be leaf or tension spring. Springs 128, 130 can be manufactured with a predetermined
generally V-shape or U-shape.
          [00122]    Spring member 128 can be assembled with cushion by sliding the spring
member 128 on the inside of the cushion, until it reaches the inverted portion 126. The
spring member 130 can be assembled with cushion by sliding the spring member 130 on the
outside of the cushion, until it reaches the inverted portion 126. Alternatively the spring
members can be split and connected as they are assembled onto the cushion. The ease of
assembly allows different springs to be used by different users. Therefore the allowed travel,
flexibility and spring stiffness can be tailored to patient preference, seal requirements or a
particular pressure range. When in position, the spring members 128, 130 can be maintained
in position by friction, and/or an adhesive. If one or both of spring members 128, 130 are
used, then it is not necessary that the inverted portion 126 have spring resiliency. In this case,
the system simply bottoms out (at low pressures) if at least one of the springs 128, 130 is not
                                                  16

used. In another embodiment, a plurality of spring members, shaped like spring members
128, 130, can be provided with various spring rates.
        [00123]     Fig 9A shows a further embodiment. Provided to the non-face contacting
portion 116 is a thin arcuate or circular section membrane 116.1 which in turn attaches to
face contacting portion 118. This thin membrane 116.1 acts as a receiving channel for an
inflatable tube 116.2. This tube acts as a spring and may be inflated or deflated by means of a
valve to vary the spring stiffness.
        [00124]     Fig. 9B illustrates an embodiment like that shown in Fig. 9, but does not
include spring members 128, 130. Instead, mask assembly 110 has a cushion 114 that
includes a groove 114.1 structured to accommodate an insert 114.2. Insert may be an open or
closed cell foam, or it may be a spring foam, i.e., one molded in a spring shape. In an
alternative, the insert 114.2 could be a gel filled member. The insert in isolation is shown in
Fig. 9C. Insert 114.2 is structured to provide a spring effect to cushion 114. Insert 114.2 is
not provided in the air path to the patient, but rather is positioned within a groove on the
outside of the cushion.
         [00125]    Fig. 10 is a partial schematic view of another embodiment, shown without
a frame. Cushion 132 includes a non-face contacting portion 134 structured to be attached to
or otherwise provided to a frame. A face contacting portion 136 includes a membrane 138
and an underlying rim 140, similar to that previously described. A central portion 142
provided between the non-face contacting and face contacting portions 134, 136 includes a
gusset portion 144. An internal spring 146, e.g., a leaf spring, an elastomer, a plastic and/or a
composite spring, is provided on the inside of the cushion 132. The internal spring 146 can
be inserted inside the cushion until it reaches the gusset portion 142, at which point the spring
146 is maintained in place via friction, glue, and/or other appropriate fastener mechanisms.
In the alternative, spring 146 can be formed with central portion 142 in an over-molding
process.
        [00126]     In the embodiment of Fig. 10, the cushion can be a standard Mirage@-type
cushion, which does not include a gusset portion 144. However, the spring 146 can be
arranged such that it pushes out the side wall of the cushion between the portions 134, 136,
thereby creating or forming the gusset portion 144. Similarly, the springs 128, 130 in the
embodiment of Fig. 9 can be used to create the inverted portion 126, in the event the side
walls of the cushion are relatively straight before the insertion of a spring member.
                                                  17

         [00127]    In yet another alternative, the cushion 110 may be provided with the
inverted portion 126, and a spring insert like spring member 146 can be inserted inside the
cushion, to evert the inverted portion 126 until it assumes an external gusset like
configuration, like that shown in Fig. 10. Conversely, the cushion may start out in the
everted state, as shown in Fig. 10, and a spring member like spring member 130 in Fig. 9 can
be provided on the outside of the cushion, to convert the gusset portion 144 into an inverted
portion as shown in Fig. 9.
        [00128]     In the event the cushion is to include a central portion which is to change
shape, e.g., everting or inverting, the cushion should be structured such that the inverted and
everted positions are stable. Such can be accomplished by allowing one or both ends of the
central portion of the cushion to bend, flex and or pivot relative to the other portions of the
cushion. The apex of the inverted or everted portion should be structured and/or its materials
selected such that it can allow for inversion or eversion. Initially, the central portion will
resist such movement, but beyond a certain limit, the central portion will flip from the
inverted position to the everted position, or vice versa. In this way, the cushion is stable in
the inverted and everted positions, generally resisting large movement, but at the same time
can be everted or inverted upon the application of sufficient force not normally encountered
during use of the mask system. The use of a spring member will help to resist inadvertent
flipping, especially for preventing inverting movement, although a spring is not necessary to
prevent either inverting or everting of the cushion.
        [00129]     Fig. 11 is a partial schematic view (without cross-hatching for clarity) of a
cushion 148 according to another embodiment. Cushion 148 includes a non-face contacting
portion 150, a face contacting portion 152, and a central portion 154 between the portions
150 and 152. Central portion 154 includes a protruding gusset portion 156. A skeleton, e.g.,
a spring member 158, may be provided within the wall thickness of at least a portion of the
gusset portion 156. A skeleton may include a malleable wire rim or bead 160 provided
around at least a portion of the circumference of the cushion. A prong rim, or lip 162 may be
provided within underlying rim 164, to help maintain its shape.
         [00130]    Fig. 12 is a partial top schematic view showing a cushion 166 including
gusset portions 168 located at one and preferably all three apices of the cushion 166. Flexible
folds or a spring 170 are provided along at least the cheek regions 172 of the cushion. These
folds allow a similar level of flexibility and travel (away from the face) as the gusset portions
168 but do not incorporate the increased area. It can be seen that the total area of the gusset
                                                  18

around the mask has been reduced, thus helping to increase visibility. The sealing force of
the cushion may be provided entirely from the gusset portions 168 or may also include some
spring force from portions 170. Moreover, portions 170 and 170.1 may be in the form of
relatively rigid beams. The gusset portions 168 may also incorporate some spring force.
        [00131]     Fig. 13 illustrates a partial schematic view of yet another embodiment of a
cushion 174 according to the present invention. Cushion 174 includes a non-face contacting
portion 176 adapted to be connected to or otherwise provided to the frame (not shown in Fig.
13). Portion 176 is preferably made of a material having a spring effect, such as
polypropylene, or another semi-rigid material such as polyurethane - one that will resiliently
maintain its general shape, but which will provide some degree of spring effect upon the
application of pressurized gas under variable pressure to the mask, tightening of the head
straps, etc. Portion 176 extends outwardly away from the end where it is connected to frame,
to an intermediate portion that includes a transition region 179 which is where the relatively
more rigid and elastic materials are joined. Portion 180 may include a membrane 182 and an
underlying rim 184, which share a common side wall 183, as described above. A projected
area 181 is defined between the end of the transition region 179 and a mid-point 182.1 of
membrane 182. As shown, the projected area 181 extends outside the area of contact 185
between membrane 182 and the patient. Pressure acts on this additional area leading to the
application of a force to the membrane 182 and underlying rim 184. Portion 180 is
preferably made of a material that is softer than the semi-rigid material of the non-face
contacting portion 176. Transition 178 may include a rigid connection between the semi
rigid and compliant materials of portions 176, 180, respectively. Alternatively, the transition
region 178 may include a hinge, e.g., a living hinge (e.g., polypropylene) or an axle hinge, or
the parts may otherwise be co-molded and allowed to move relative to one another by flexing
or bending relative to one another.
        [00132]     Fig. 13A shows another embodiment which is similar to the embodiment
of Fig. 13, but which add a spring portion 180.1.
        [00133]     Fig 14 illustrates a partial schematic view of still another embodiment
according to the present invention. A cushion 186 includes a non-face contacting portion
188, a face contacting portion 190 and a central portion 192 located generally between the
portions 188, 190. Central portion 192 includes a gusset portion 193, like that described
above. Face contacting portion 190 includes a membrane 194 and an inflatable chamber 196
provided below the membrane 194. Inflatable chamber 196 forms an underlying rim and
                                                   19

includes a channel 198 that is filled with air or another suitable fluid, such as gel and/or soft
durameter elastomer. The stiffness of chamber 196 can be changed depending on the
pressure of the medium contained therein, or the pressure can be fixed at a predetermined
range or level. The stiffener also depends on the material make-up of chamber 196.
         [00134]     Fig. 15 discloses another embodiment of a cushion 200 having an elastic
cuff 202. The elastic cuff is provided between face contacting portion 204, including
membrane 206 and rim 208. Advantages of the elastic cuff are described in U.S. Non
Provisional Patent Application No 10/655,622 filed September 5, 2003. In Fig. 15, the elastic
cuff 202 can be used in conjunction with a gusset portion 209.
         [00135]     The chamber 196 (Fig. 14) or elastic cuff 202 (Fig. 15) provides a spring
or spring-like effect. The spring should be of comparative stiffness to that provided as the
gusset is compressed at a pressure. Thus, the chamber/cuff plus gusset provides additional
force when the gusset is compressed. This force is provided without increasing the area of
the gusset, which is less obtrusive to the patient. This helps provide a force at low pressures
such as 4cm H20 to allow the performance to fit within the zone Z (Fig. 5). Because this
force does not increase proportionally with pressure (as does the force provided by gusset
area), the increase is not as significant at high pressures as it would have been if the gusset
area had been increased to try and fit within zone Z. Compare, e.g., Fig. 43 of U.S. Non
Provisional Patent Application No. 10/655,622.
         [00136]     Fig. 16A illustrates a partial schematic view of a cushion 210 according to
yet another embodiment of the present invention. Cushion 210 has a non-face contacting
portion 212 adapted to be connected to or otherwise provided to a frame (not shown in this
view). Face-contacting portion 214 is provided at the other end of cushion. A central portion
216 is provided between the portions 212 and 214. Central portion 216 includes a side wall
portion, e.g., a thin walled section 218, which may take the form of one or more cut-outs,
grooves or areas of predetermined weakness, e.g., one or more portions subject to
deformation and resilient restoration of their shape. The side wall or thin walled section 218
may resiliently deform, buckle or flex upon donning of the mask and/or with changes in air
delivery pressure and/or strap tension, in which case the cushion would form an improvised
gusset portion. The thus formed gusset portion in the side wall can be converted back into a
substantially straight wall section when the force and/or pressure is removed.
         [00137]     In the position shown in Fig. 16A, a projected area 215 extends from the
center point of membrane 214 to the outer surface of side wall. If sufficient force is provided
                                                  20

to the central portion, the side wall of the central portion 216 will extend or buckle outwardly,
as shown in Fig. 16B to form an increased projected area 215'. In the position shown in Fig.
16B, projected area 215' of the improvised gusset portion 217 extends outward and defines a
projected area that is greater than projected area 215. Pressure acts upon this additional area
effectively increasing the sealing force. This is more likely to occur at low pressures when
the force on the mask due to pressure is low and thus the strap tension can deform the
cushion. At high pressures, the increased force on the mask due to pressure is more likely to
cause the headgear straps to move or extend and thus the side wall will assume the general
posture shown in Fig. 16A, in which case there is little or no projected area or stored spring
force, meaning that sealing force is maintained by strap tension that opposes the gas delivery
pressure tending to move or lift the mask away from the face.
        [00138]     This design acts as a spring under relatively light load and has gusset-like
effect at higher pressure, thereby providing a variable effect. The spring becomes weaker
when bent, which helps form a gusset which increases sealing force.
        [00139]     Fig. 16C illustrates yet another embodiment in which wall 218' has a
variable thickness, e.g., created using a notch 218B. This will cause wall 218' to collapse at
the weakest point, to add predictability. Fig. 16D is yet another embodiment in which side
wall 218" is pre-formed at an angle, to encourage buckling outward or inwards, as desired.
        [00140]     Fig 17 shows a partial, schematic perspective view according to a variation
of the embodiment in Figs. 16A and 16B. Central portion 216 is provided with a plurality of
cut-outs 220' to provide predetermined areas of weakness which may flex or buckle to
provide one or more of the advantages described. Central portion 216 could be in the form of
an adapter that is provided to the non-face contacting portion of a standard or conventional
cushion. Cut-outs 220' are preferably not in the form of thru-holes, but rather are in the form
of blind-bore apertures.
        [00141]     The contact force applied to the patient's face can be tailored by adjusting
a wall thickness of central portion 216. The central portion acts as a spring structure to
provide a component of the contact force on the patient's face through the membrane 214.
Central portion 216 may have a uniform wall thickness with a thin cross-section. The central
portion may have a thicker cross-section, with the thinner wall providing a smaller
component of force than the thicker wall. The cross-section of the wall may vary around the
perimeter of the gusset portion 217. For example, a gusset portion may have a thin wall in
the patient's nasal bridge region, but a thicker wall in the patient's cheek region. Moreover,
                                                 21

the wall of central portion may be varied in conjunction with the desired maximum projected
area 215, for example, by increasing the thickness of the wall to result in a reduced projected
area 215.
         [00142]    Fig. 18A is yet another schematic drawing depicting a cushion 222
according to a different embodiment. Cushion 222 includes a non-face contacting portion
224 structured to be attached or otherwise provided to a cushion frame (not shown in this
figure). A face contacting portion 226, in this example having only a single membrane, can
be provided opposite the non-face contacting portion 224. A central portion 228 between the
portions 224, 226 may include a buckle region 230. Depending on the pressure inside the
mask and the strap tension, buckle region will allow the central portion 228 to flex, bow or
move outwardly, to thereby effect a change in the projected area of the cushion on the face.
This in turn changes the force applied to the face contacting portion 226. Fig. 18B shows the
cushion in such a position, including an increased projected area 231'.
         [00143]    Fig. 19A is a partial schematic view of a cushion 232 according to still
another embodiment of the invention. Cushion 232 includes a non-face contacting portion
234, a face contacting portion 236 and a central portion 238. A rim 240 may be positioned
below a membrane 242 of portion 236, although it is not necessary. The membrane 236
branches away from rim support 246, and has a relatively rounded outer wall profile. A
space 248 is created between the outer side of the rim support 246 and the inner side of the
membrane. With this structure, the membrane 242 and central portion 238 may more easily
flex, bow or pivot outwardly to enable a change from projected area 239 (Fig. 19A) to
increased projected area 239', as shown in Fig. 19B. As shown in Fig 19A, outward
movement of the membrane/central portion can be facilitated by scoring or cutting a small
notch 249 in the wall of the membrane or central portion. This embodiment provides the
advantages of a gusset portion. However, if a seal cannot be formed, the straps can be
tightened so that the membrane 242 rests against the rim 240.
         [00144]    Fig. 20A is a partial schematic view of a cushion 250 according to yet
another embodiment of the invention. Cushion 250 includes a non-face contacting portion
252, a face contacting portion 254 and a central portion 256 between the portions 252 and
254. Central portion includes thin walled sections that can kink, like a drinking straw, when
the air delivery pressure changes. The kinking sections may be formed of a relatively rigid or
semi-rigid plastic that is formed to allow it to flex, e.g., via a thin-walled section. For
example, the plastic is like that of a drinking straw, which is generally rigid but can deform or
                                                 22

flex as desired compared to the cushions that are made of silicone. In this embodiment, the
projected area may not necessarily change, although provision could be made to do so.
However, thin wall sections, e.g., about 0.2-1.0 mm, in central portion 256 have a spring
effect which helps maintain the seal in place and a sufficient sealing force, especially during
low pressure periods or during changes of gas delivery pressure. Fig. 20B shows cushion in a
crushed state, in which central portion 256 has been plastically deformed to assume this
configuration. The cushion maintains this shape, even without force, because it is plastically
(v. elastically) deformed. In this position, central portion offers little or no spring effect.
         [00145]     Fig. 21 is a partial schematic view of a mask assembly 260 according to
another embodiment of the present invention. Assembly 260 includes a frame 262 and a
cushion 264, e.g., a ResMed Mirage @ cushion, both of which are commercially available.
Assembly 260 includes a segmented design having an intermediate adapter portion 266 with
a first end 268 that interfaces with the frame 262 and a second end 270 that interfaces with
the cushion 264. Intermediate adapter portion 266 can be made of a relatively rigid or semi
rigid material, such as polypropylene formed in a thin wall to allow for flexing, and it may
include a gusset portion 272. This allows for customization of the gusset portion to suit the
flexibility or force range that is required. Alternatively, intermediate adapter portion 266
may include any of the alternatives described herein for providing more flexibility of the
mask or for allowing a change in the applied sealing force with a change in pressure, e.g., via
the use of a variable projected area and/or a variable spring force provided by a spring
member or other resilient force. In this way, any mask can be retrofit to include an
intermediate adapter member 266 according to this embodiment. Moreover, various ones of
the embodiments described herein can be provided on an intermediate adapter portion so that
the existing mask components need not be modified. Frame 262 may be integrally formed
with gusset portion 272, with cushion 264 detachably provided thereto.
         [00146]     Fig. 22 illustrates a partial view of a cushion 274 having a gusset portion
276 positioned between non-face contacting and face contacting portions 278, 280 of the
cushion. Cushion 274 is substantially entirely gel-filled. Gel may include a soft flexible
liquid, semi-liquid and/or visco-elastic polymer. Such gel material may be disposed and
displaced within a skinned body. The skin may be stiff (non-stretchable), or it may be elastic
or subject to elongation. Fig. 23 illustrates an alternative in which only a portion 282 is filled
with gel. In Fig. 23, the gel portion 282 acts as a spring to provide the advantages of adding a
spring previously discussed.
                                                   23

         [00147]    Fig. 24 is a partial schematic view of a cushion 284 having a gusset
portion 286. The contact force applied to the patient's face can be tailored by providing one
or more reinforcement structures. The size, shape and geometry of these reinforcement
structures can be arranged to vary stiffness in different sections of the gusset portion 286.
For example, less stiff sections at nasal bridge region, stiffer sections at cheek region, to
provide the required comfort and seal level. In this example, an inside portion of the gusset
portion 286 includes a reinforcement member 288, e.g., an elastic flap or a gel filled pocket.
Gel may act as a shock absorber and/or provide additional cushioning if and when the
cushion bottoms out. An alternative to gel is gel foam, e.g., gel with bubbles or other filler
with various compressible qualities. The added resiliency of member 288 has the advantage
of preventing overstretching or undesirable deformation of the gusset portion 286 at high
pressure or relative movement between frame and cushion, e.g., by bumping at night.
        [00148]     Member 288 should have a spring stiffness similar to that of the gusset
under pressure and thus will provide additional force as the gusset closes. As previously
discussed (for cuffs and springs) this force is not pressure related. Thus it increases the force
at low pressure allowing the performance of the mask to fit within the zone Z, see Fig. 5.
         [00149]    Figs. 24A-24U illustrate further embodiments according to the present
invention. Fig. 24U schematically illustrates a partial section of a mask assembly 800 having
a cushion including a face contacting/interacting portion 802 that may include a membrane
804 with an optional underlying rim 806. Cushion includes a non-face contacting portion
808 that is supported by a frame 810. A central portion 812, in the form of a black box, is
provided between portions 806 and 808.
         [00150]    Figs. 24A-24T illustrate various central portions that can be used for
control portion 812 in Fig. 24U. In the case of Figs. 24N and 24R, face-contacting
interacting portion 808 and/or frame 810 (Fig. 24U) would be adjusted, e.g., widened, to
accommodate for illustrated offset. Various features of Figs. 24A-24T are tabulated below in
Table 1.

Drawings Comment
Fig. 24A Circular cross-section. Provides more travel for the same outer area. The
         circular shape will deform less when pressurized, therefore outer area remains
         constant.
Fig. 24B Underside notch has dual purpose. On extension provides more travel (longer
         path length), on compression acts as spring. Upperside is tapered wall
         section.
Fig. 24C Circular cross-section at end of straight gusset. Provides more travel for the
         same outer area. The circular shape will deform less when pressurized,
         therefore outer area remains constant.
Fig. 24D Like Fig. 24C, but with tapered or thickened wall section. When pressurized,
         the thickened wall section tends to keep the form.
Fig. 24E Underside notch provides more travel on extension. This is assisted by the
         thickened upper wall which tends to keep the form. This also allows for a
         constant outer area (Ag).
Fig. 24F In compression, a spring constant is added. In extension, no spring effect
         (one-sided spring). This has the advantage of having a spring at low pressures
         but not necessarily at high pressures.
Fig. 24G Angled gusset provides more travel for the same outer area.
Fig. 24H Internal gusset provides more travel for the same outer area.
Fig. 241 Thickened section deforms only under higher pressures. At lower pressures,
         thickened section will touch when gusset is compressed and act as spring.
         This has the advantage of having a spring at low pressures but not necessarily
         at high pressures.
Fig. 24J Thickened section deforms only under higher pressures. This moves the
         spring tab away from the lower section (i.e., no spring). At lower pressures,
         spring tab will touch when gusset is compressed and act at spring. This has
         the advantage of having a spring at low pressures but not necessarily at high
         pressures.
Fig. 24K Thickened section will not deform under pressure, maximizes outer area with
         respect to Fig. 24G. Angled gusset also provides for more travel for the same
         area.

         [00151]     Figs. 25-27C are illustrations of a mask assembly 290 according to still
another embodiment of the present invention. Mask assembly 290 includes a frame 292
which is provided with a cushion 294. Cushion 294 and breathing chamber forming portion
298 are formed in one piece, although they could be formed in separate pieces and/or portion
298 could be formed as part of frame 292. Cushion 294 has a resilient face contacting
portion 296. Cushion is provided to frame 292 as shown and described in U.S. Design Patent
no. D484,237, U.S. non-Provisional patent application no. 10/221,572 and U.S. non
provisional patent application no. 10/221,574 each incorporated herein by reference in its
entirety.
                                                  26

         [00152]    Cushion 294 is adapted to include a concertina-type gusset portion 300,
including one or more folds. As seen in Fig. 26, the gusset portion 300 tapers as it approaches
the apex 301 of the mask above the nose of the patient. As shown in Fig. 27A, it can be seen
that gusset portion 300 also tapers in width as it approaches the apex. As such, the gusset
portion 300 is at a minimum or nil at the apex, meaning that very little if any gusset type
compensation is offered at the apex. The gusset portion 300 essentially allows the cushion
294 to move in an arcuate manner generally indicated by arrow 302 in Fig. 27A. This may be
described as a "hinged-concertina" form of a gusset portion. Fig. 27B shows the cushion
without the frame. Fig. 27C shows the gusset portion in a stretched or expanded position, as
indicated by the area 302.
         [00153]    As a further design, as shown in Fig. 27D, the flexibility could be achieved
through the addition of one or more small compression springs 300.1 on the bottom corners
of the mask and the cushion may have a thin side wall that could collapse in any direction.
A hinge point may be provided at the apex. A portion 300.2 could be formed with a rigid
beam, as desired.
         [00154]    Fig. 27E shows a mask assembly 290 like that shown in Fig. 27A, but the
bottom portion of the gusset is converted into one or more compression springs 300.3.
Compression springs 300.3 may take the form of a single spring that is generally centered
over the lip portion, or it may include a spring at each corner of the bottom portion of the
cushion.
         [00155]    Fig. 28 is a schematic view of a mask assembly 310 having a frame 312
and a cushion 314. Frame 312 includes a bulbous flange portion 316 which simulates the
shape of a gusset portion. Bulbous portion 316 may be solid, or it may simply be a skeleton
with ribs which may help the bulbous flange portion 316 to act as a spring. Cushion 314 may
include a thin membranous section 318 that is stretched to seal over bulbous portion 316.
Section 318 may be made of silicone, gel and/or foam.
         [00156]    In use, the silicone may extend away from the bulbous flange portion due
to either the weight of the cushion or the force of the pressurized gas acting on it. However,
if the headgear straps are tightened and the gusset portion is compressed, the silicone will
bottom out upon the spring which will provide an additional sealing force.
         [00157]    In another aspect, the gusset portion or the simulated versions or
adaptations of the gusset portion have applications particularly suited to barriatrics. In
particular, due to rapid weight loss following a barriatric operation, the flexible nature of the
                                                27

gusset helps to accommodate changes in the shape of the face, thereby maintaining a seal
with the same cushion and forehead strap position throughout the treatment period. Standard
cushions including silicone, gel and foam-based products may not have sufficient flexibility
to achieve a seal though the treatment period, in particular require modifications to the strap
lengths, and possibly changes in cushion sizing. With the cushions described herein, an
automatic sealing system is provided, i.e., the cushion may move automatically to seal
against the face. This automatic motion compensates for variations in pressure and variations
in facial position.
         [00158]    An advantage of the systems described herein is that each can be
customized through variation of the projected area of the gusset around the perimeter of the
lower cushion to provide tailored forces at differing locations. One potential use of this
technology relates to use for infant masks. For example, the mask can utilize gusset portions
to provide force at set locations which are most comfortable for an infant. In another
example, a system of different gussets for different nights or weeks could be implemented
with each changing the pressure points and preventing continuous constant pressure from a
mask deforming the face.
         [00159]    Fig. 29 illustrates a schematic drawing of a cushion 400 according to still
another embodiment of the present invention. Cushion 400 in this example, is a nasal
cushion, although it could also be a full face (oro-nasal) cushion. Cushion 400 includes a
nasal bridge region 402, an upper lip region 404 and cheek regions 406 therebetween.
Cushion 400 includes a region 408, including a gusset and/or spring portion, as described
above. Region 408 has variable dimensions along the perimeter of the cushion 400. For
example, region 408 is defined between the perimeter edge 412 of the cushion 400 and a
dotted line 410 shown in Fig. 29. As shown, region 408 is relatively small or nil in the nasal
bridge and/or upper lip regions 402, 404, where relatively little force is required, which can
help reduce the possibility of discomfort, while cheek regions 406 have a relatively wider
profile for region 408. Further, region 408 has cut away portions 412 to allow for improved
patient vision. Cut-out 412.1 is provided to reduce/eliminate contact with lip of patient.
Figs. 30-33 illustrate cushion 400 from various perspectives and views. Non-face contacting
portion 414 and face contacting portion 416, including membrane 418, are shown, e.g., in
Fig. 30.
         [00160]    The force is primarily applied to the cheek region and in particular the
creases in the cheek. These areas are the least sensitive to pressure and are thus preferable for
                                                28

reasons of comfort. In addition the force is focused on areas where there may be leak (like
creases in the cheek) rather than areas where typically little leak occurs (eg: upper lip region).
The areas where there is little gusset area such as the upper lip region may contain concertina
type folds 400.1 (see Fig. 33A). These allow the flexibility and travel that the gusset provides
without applying force due to pressure. As an alternative embodiment, these folds may
incorporate some element of spring force through any of the methods previously discussed.
        [00161]     Although gusset area is near zero in the region of the eyes and lips of the
patient, the thin wall has a height (Fig. 29A) that allows the cushion to rotate sideways to
maximize stability. The effect is similar to that described above in relation to Fig. 31
(described below), in which the vertical centerline acts as a hinge about which side portions
(cheek regions) may pivot. Although displacement of cushion to frame is reduced, the
cushion still decouples frame movement side-to-side.
Full Face Mask Embodiments
        [00162]     Figs. 50-55 disclose two alternative embodiments of the present invention
which are directed to full face masks.
        [00163]     Figs. 50-52 illustrate a mask assembly 900 including a shell 902 with
integrally attached slots 904 for receiving straps of a headgear assembly, not shown. Shell
902 is provided with a source of pressurized air through central aperture, typically via an air
supply conduit such as an elbow 903. Shell 902 also includes upstanding support structure
908 which may be provided for the support of the forehead pad assembly. Shell 902 may
also be provided with one or more vents 910. In Fig. 50, a portion of a cushion 912 can be
seen around the perimeter of shell 902. In particular, cushion 912 is provided with a gusset
914 having frontal and side profile views which are similar to that disclosed in Figs. 29 and
30-33. For example, as shown in Fig. 50, gusset 914 includes cheek regions 914a, a nasal
bridge region 914b, and a lower lip region 914c. As described above in relation to Fig. 29,
for example, these portions of the gusset have various profiles in order to tailor the amount of
force which is applied to the particular region of the patient's face, depending on the
sensitivity of the patient's face as well as the required sealing forces thereof.
        [00164]     Fig. 51 is a side profile view of the mask assembly 900. Cushion includes
a shell contacting portion 913 which may have a profile, for example, shown in Fig. 10.
Gusset 914 is seen as having a relatively low profile in the nasal bridge region 914b. For
example, the nasal bridge region 914b is provided generally adjacent the upper portion of the
                                                  29

shell which is covered by the shell contacting portion 913 of cushion 912. A face contacting
portion 916 may include a soft membrane as well as an underlying rim, as described in
relation to Fig. 10.
        [00165]      Further, a ring shaped reinforcement 918 is provided between gusset 914
and face contacting portion 916. Further details of the reinforcement 918 are described in
U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/643,121, filed January 12, 2005, incorporated by
reference in its entirety. The reinforcement 918 may be secured to the cushion 912 in any
suitable manner. For example, the reinforcement 918 may be attached to an exterior surface
of the cushion 912, e.g., by friction fit, adhesive, and/or mechanical fasteners. In an
embodiment, the reinforcement 918 may be provided within a groove circumscribing a
portion of cushion 912 which lies between gusset 914 and face contacting portion 916. The
reinforcement 918 has a function of limiting distendability or expansion of the cushion 912
when subject to high pressures, for example. In one embodiment, the reinforcement 918 may
be constructed of a substantially rigid material, e.g., plastic, composite. In another
embodiment, the reinforcement 918 may take the form of an insert made of open or closed
cell foam and function like insert 114.2 described above in Figs. 9B and 9C.
        [00166]      Figs. 53-55 disclose a mask assembly 950 according to yet another
embodiment of the present invention. Mask assembly 950 includes a shell substantially
identical to that described in relation to Figs. 50-52, and will not be described in more detail
with respect to this embodiment. The main difference between this embodiment and the
embodiment of Figs. 50-52 resides in the structure and function of cushion 912. For
example, cushion 912 in Figs. 53-55 has a gusset 932 which is generally equal in the nasal
bridge region, the cheek regions, and the lower lip region. For example, in comparing Figs.
51 and 54, it can be seen that the gusset portion 932 in the nasal bridge region in Fig. 54
extends higher than the edge of the shell 902, as opposed to the arrangement shown in Fig. 51
in which the nasal bridge region 914B is substantially equal in height as compared to shell
902. In addition, cushion 912 shown in Figs. 53-55 includes an insert 918 similar to that
described in relation to Figs. 50-52. Insert 918 may include a gap 920 (Fig. 55) which is
provided in the nasal bridge region of insert 918.
Headstrap Plate Variation
        [00167]      Fig. 56 illustrates schematically a mask assembly 900 according to another
embodiment of the present invention.
                                                  30

         [00168]    Mask assembly 960 includes a cushion 962 including a face contacting
portion 964 which may be similar to that described above. Cushion 962 is supported by a
bellows 966 which in this embodiment is further provided to a plate 968. The bellows 966
may expand under mask pressure. Plate 968 can have a total force defined by the area of the
plate times the mask pressure to which the plate is subjected (F=Area x P).
        [00169]     The force is applied to ends x and y of lever arms 970 and 970,
respectively, so that each lever area experiences a force defined by the area times the pressure
divided by two (F=Area x P/2). Each lever 910 is mounted so as to pivot about an axis 972,
which in this example is asymmetrically oriented such that it defines a distance t1 and a
second distance 2. The force is multiplied by the ratio 2 divided by t1 (2/1)        and
transferred to a rod 974 provided to each lever 970. Each rod 974 is connected to a strap
lever 976, which in this case is pivotably mounted at a point which is approximately in the
center of lever 976. Lever 976 in turn is connected to a strap portion of 978 of a headgear
assembly. Accordingly, each strap 978 is tensioned with the force defined by the relation:
                    F = Area x / 2 x    '1.
Accordingly, strap tension is proportional to mask pressure.
After-Market Clamp Accessory
        [00170]     Fig. 34 illustrates a cushion 500, generally like the cushion shown in Fig.
1. Cushion 500 includes a gusset portion 502. One or more clamps, schematically shown as
paper clips 504 in this example, can be applied to gusset portion 502 in various positions.
Clamps 504 can be positioned radially outward from the cushion to adjust the width of gusset
portion 502, which may include a spring portion, to thereby adjust the projected area.
Clamps 508 are positioned on the cushion where it is desirable or allowable to reduce the
contact force. Further, the clamps may be positioned along any portion of the perimeter of
cushion 500, to thereby fine tune balance between maximum comfort and sealing force.
        [00171]     As an alternative, gusset portion 502 may include a linear fastener such as
a tongue and groove arrangement that is used in Zip-LocTM plastic bags. The linear fastener
may be provided along the entire perimeter, as shown in imaging dotted lines 506 in Fig. 34,
or only a portion thereof, of the cushion 500. When tongue and groove of linear fastener are
engaged, the gusset portion 502 would be generally inoperable, such that the cushion 500
would operate as though it did not include a gusset portion. Alternatively the tongue and
groove of linear fastener are positioned mid-way or at some preferred distance from the edge
                                                 31

of the gusset and when engaged, whilst the gusset portion exterior to the tongue and groove is
inoperable, the gusset within the tongue and groove still operates. This may be used to apply
a gusset to selected regions of the face for example. In another alternative, the cushion could
include a plurality of concentric sets of tongues/grooves, such that the width of the gusset
portion can be selectively adjusted.
         [00172]     Fig. 35 illustrates cushion 500 with another example of a clamping
arrangement. In this embodiment, clamps 508 may be made of plastic and/or metal. Clamps
508 are provided along a central axis 509 of cushion 500. As shown in Fig. 36, cushion 500,
in particular the lateral sides of gusset portion 502, are encouraged to flex or bow about axis
509, thereby wrapping the gusset portion 502 and/or adjoining sections of the cushion 500
towards the patient's face in the cheek regions. This helps promote a good seal in a region of
the patient's face which is best able to withstand prolonged sealing forces. Thus, wrapping or
bowing of the gusset portion can be achieved without the use of clamps 508.
         [00173]     Clamps 504, 508 can be provided as an after-market accessory, to help
patients tailor the cushion fit according to their special needs. Alternatively, a range of
cushions with gusset portions having various profiles, sizes, and spring constants could be
provided.
Over-the-Head Mask Systems
         [00174]     Fig. 37 illustrates a mask assembly 320 including a patient interface 322,
e.g., a cushion or a nozzle assembly, which is in communication with an over-the-head air
inlet tube 324. A ball joint 326 or hinge, e.g., forms a connection between interface 322 and
tube 324. Tube may optionally include a spring 328, e.g., a stainless steel leaf spring, to help
bias the interface 322 towards the patient's face, to thereby help ensure support for mask
and/or a good seal, while at the same time offering a higher degree of flexibility and/or
comfort. Alternatively, the inlet tube 324 can be formed of a material having inherent
resiliency, thereby avoiding the need for spring 328. Inlet tube 324 received pressurized gas
from air delivery conduit 330. Headgear 331 is provided to support and/or hold the mask
assembly and/or the air delivery conduit.
         [00175]     With this arrangement, ball joint 326 allows interface 322 to rotate about
all axes of movement, at least to some degree. This helps to decouple for forces associated
with supporting the headgear from the forces associated with a maintaining a seal. This is
similar to the use of a gusset, which also helps decouple these forces. In yet another
                                                  32

embodiment, the spring 328 and/or tube 324 could have a variable stiffness than changes with
pressure, e.g., get stiffer with pressure increases.
         [00176]    In an alternative embodiment shown in Fig. 38, mask assembly 332
includes a flexible wall joint 340 to replace the ball joint from Fig. 37. Wall joint 340 allows
relative movement between interface 334 and inlet tube 336. Inlet tube 336 may include
inherent springness, or it may include spring, e.g., a stainless steel leaf spring 338. Headgear
342 may be provided to support mask assembly and/or air delivery conduit 344. Tube 336
and/or spring 338 may change stiffness with pressure variations, as described above.
Changeable Extendability of Headgear
         [00177]    In another form of the invention, the extensibility of the headgear is
selectively variable. For example, relatively low elasticity headgear might be used for low
mask pressures, while relatively higher elasticity headgear may be used for high mask
pressures, such as around 20 cm H2 0. In one form, this is achieved by having duplicate
straps within the headgear, one extensible, the other, relatively inextensible. At low
pressures, both straps are used, the net effect being that the headgear is relatively
inextensible. At high pressures, the inextensible strap is disengaged, with the result that the
headgear is relatively extensible overall.
        [00178]     Fig. 39 illustrates the contact force of the cushion on the patient's face
against travel of the mask shell towards the face. As can be seen from Fig. 39, the contact
force of the cushion Fe linearly increases with the travel of the mask shell towards the face,
for three constant pressures P1, P2 and P3. For each pressure, the contact force Fe is defined
by the relation Fc=Pi(Ag-Ac), where Ag is the projected area of the gusset and Ac is the contact
area between the face and the cushion, e.g., the membrane of the cushion. If the gusset
includes a spring, a spring constant k times its displacement distance x must be taken into
account as well.
         [00179]    Fig. 39 shows a first curve which represents headgear with low elasticity,
and a second curve which represents headgear with high elasticity. Low elasticity headgear
may be used for VPAP and CPAP applications, while high elasticity headgear may be useful
for auto set applications.
         [00180]    For CPAP, a constant position may be preferable, ie: the force is
maintained constantly with the set pressure at the preferred sealing and comfort position. The
gusset still provides flexibility to allow for movements in head position and skin position
                                                 33

through the night. The use of low elasticity headgear means that this position is maintained.
However some users may prefer high elasticity for comfort and a totally flexible system.
         [00181]    For VPAP, a low elasticity headgear may be preferred since this prevents
the frame 'bouncing', ie: moving backwards and forwards with changes in pressure since
both the gusset and headgear are elastic. This 'bouncing' may disrupt the flow generator
control systems or may lead to discomfort. Similarly, some users may prefer high elasticity
for comfort and a totally flexible system.
         [00182]    Fig. 40 illustrates an embodiment including headgear with selectively
variable elasticity. For example, a portion 600 of a headgear strap is shown in Figs. 40 and
41. Headgear strap portion 600 includes a first end 602 structured to connect with a slotted
headgear connector formed on forehead support or mask frame, as shown in Fig. 1. Portion
600 includes a second end 604 which is configured for connection to a rear part of the
headgear which is guided around the back of the patient's head. Headgear strap portion 600
includes an intermediate portion 606 which includes gathers. First and second portions 602
and 604 are made of relatively inextensible or relatively non-elastic materials such that there
length does not substantially change upon application of tensile forces. In comparison,
intermediate portion 606 is relatively elastic and can change in accordance with strap tension.
Examples of the materials used for the relatively more elastic intermediate portion 606
include any suitable elastomeric material which is suitably covered with a cloth material that
is comfortable to the patient. Therefore, if the patient or clinician selects relatively more
extensible headgear for use with a particular patient's therapy, the relatively elastic
intermediate portion will change in length as pressure is changed.
         [00183]    Headgear portion also includes a supplemental strap portion 608 which is
made of a relatively less or substantially inextensible material. Supplemental strap portion
608 includes a fastener 610 which may be selectively coupled with a complimentary fastener
portion 612 provided on first portion 602, which is substantially inelastic. Fasteners may take
the form of buckles, snaps and VELCRO@, for example. If the fasteners 610 and 612 are
engaged, headgear strap portion 600 is thereby rendered substantially inextensible, as the
supplemental strap portion 608 forms a bridge over and renders inoperative the relatively
elastic intermediate portion 606. Fig. 41 is a side view showing additional details of strap
portion 600. Also, strap portion 608 allows a patient to stretch a mask system off the head
without unclipping or detaching, thereby improving convenience of removing mask and
donning same.
                                                34

         [00184]     In accordance with another embodiment, the selection of either the
extensible or substantially inextensible modes can be performed automatically, in conjunction
with the operating pressure of the system. For example, Fig. 42 shows a portion 620 of strap
assembly including a first portion 622 adapted to be provided to a slotted connector or a
slotted connector clip of the mask frame or forehead support. The second end 624 is
provided to the remaining portion of headgear which leads to the rear portion of the patient's
head. Headgear also includes a relatively elastic portion, schematically illustrated as element
626 in Fig. 42. As indicated, the elasticity of portion 626 allows the headgear to extend with
increased pressure or tensile forces applied to the strap. First and second portions 622 and
624 are made of relatively inextensible or non-elastic material. A supplemental strap portion
628 includes a first end 630 provided adjacent first portion 622 of the strap assembly.
Supplemental strap portion 628 includes a second end 630 fixedly attached to second end
624. A sleeve 634 may be provided to surround a portion of main strap portion 621 and
supplemental strap portion 628. A portion of main strap portion 621 includes a first coupling
member 636 while supplemental strap portion 628 includes a second coupling member 638.
Coupling members 636 and 638 may be in the form of an electromagnetic assembly which is
selectively operable in dependence on sensed operating pressure of the mask assembly.
Accordingly, if the mask operating pressure is too high, coupling attraction between coupling
members 636 and 638 can be discontinued, thereby allowing the headgear portion 620 to
stretch via relatively elastic or extensible portion 626. At relatively lower pressures, the
coupling members 636 and 638 can be engaged so that the headgear becomes relatively
inelastic, which thereby improves sealing at lower operating pressures. Of course, the use of
electromagnetic coupling members is exemplary only, as numerous other alternatives would
be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art.
         [00185]     Figs. 42A and 42B schematically illustrate mask systems on a patient that
utilize selectively extensible headgear. In Fig. 42A, an elastic strap portion 650 forms a
bridge between relatively non-extendible portions 652, 654 of headgear, thereby allowing the
lower strap portion, as a whole, to stretch.
         [00186]     Portions 652, 654 include recesses 658 (Fig. 42A) that are adapted to
receive a relatively inextensible strap portion or member 660, shown in position in Fig. 42B.
Member 660 includes hooks or projections that are received in recesses 658.
         [00187]     In one example, the headgear may be used with a gusset portion or a
improvised or simulated gusset portion described above. When used in conjunction with the
                                                  35

autosetting device, an advantage over substantially inextensible headgear can be gained by
employing headgear which incorporates a set amount of elasticity. This provides a system
that allows the headgear length to be set at a low initial pressure for the autoset unit, e.g.,
about 4-6 cm H 20. At these pressures, the gusset portion should normally be set in a
substantially closed position, allowing the maximum force to be applied. See Fig. 39. This
provides a seal even at low mask pressure. As the pressure is increased using the autoset
system, the gusset may ideally extend away from the face, providing less force than if it was
in the almost closed position and thus more comfort, although a seal is still maintained as the
pressure is higher than it was at the low setting (4-6 cm H2 0). A similar behaviour to this
could also be used for the ramping functionality of the flow generators (i.e., those machines
that start at a low pressure and then ramp to the preferred setting). The extensibility preferred
to allow the gusset to move away from the face can be achieved by modifying the material
that is used for the headgear, e.g., silicone versus polypropylene. Alternatively, an elastic
strip can be incorporated into the headgear, as described above in relation to Figs. 40 and 41.
As an additional feature this strip may incorporate a clip or hook or other fasteners so that it
may be restrained when the elasticity is not required. This, therefore, provides a headgear
than can be optimized for either CPAP or bi-level treatment where elasticity is not required or
auto setting treatment where elasticity is preferred. See Fig. 39.
Further Embodiments
         [00188]     In another embodiment shown in Fig. 43, the force associated with use of
forehead pad assembly 820 can be changed in dependence of treatment pressure. The
forehead pad assembly 820 can be attached to a forehead support in the manner illustrated in
Figs. 25, 26, 27A and 27C. This may provide a way of optimizing position relative to the
face and improve comfort by providing something that feels more like an air cushion. Such
forehead pads could provide decoupling of the forces between the forehead support frame
and the forehead pads in the patient's forehead region, which may improve patient comfort
and compliance.
         [00189]     In an alternative, each forehead pad 822 may include a chamber 824 that
may be filled with air, a gel, etc. The pressure within each chamber 824 may be fixed,
meaning a closed system, or it can be linked to mask pressure, in which case the forehead
support would be pushed away from the head when air pressure increases.
                                                  36

         [00190]     In another alternative, the pressure within each chamber 824 may be
adjustable, e.g., via a pump 826. A servo control 828 could be used to set the pressure. In
another alternative, the pressure could be controlling dynamically, independent from mask
pressure, e.g., via servo control 828 that receives information from a position and/or pressure
sensor. Such dynamic control can be pre-programmed and/or based on IPAP/EPAP, AutoSet
changes in mask pressure at night, and/or the pressure ramp up stage as the patient falls
asleep. Moreover, the feedback can be based on sensed leak measurement to adjust the
forehead support to improve mask leaks in real time. Leak measurement can be used to
dynamically adjust the forehead support when the patient falls asleep.
         [00191]     In still another embodiment, the pads 822 may be mounted on spring
portions 823, which form a portion of or are inserted within a side walls of the pads. The
embodiment can be used independently of or in conjunction with the other embodiments.
         [00192]     In another embodiment, the shape of the gusset portion may be maintained
in an optimum position. For example, position sensors can be used to measure the
displacement or change or shape of the gusset. The shape of the gusset portion can be
changed, e.g., bent or straightened, depending on the sensed position of the gusset, or the
sensed strap tension. In another example, the forehead pad(s) can be used to adjust the shape
of the gusset portion. For example, a feedback loop may be used to monitor the position of
the gusset portion, and the forehead pads can be mounted on a screw or other adjustable
device which can be changed in dependence with the sensed shape and/or position of the
gusset portion.
         [00193]     In yet another embodiment shown in Fig. 44, forehead pad(s) 830 can be
adjustably mounted to forehead support 832. For example, the forehead pads 830 can be
mounted to the frame using a ball joints 834 which pivot in two or more planes. This would
effectively decouple the action of moving the forehead support or frame from the application
of force to the patient. In addition, ball joints 834 can be mounted on springs 836 so they
press against the forehead in a controlled fashion. Another embodiment is shown in Fig. 45,
in which roller balls 838 contact the patient's forehead 840 and are spring mounted on a
support 842. Therefore, the shape of the forehead pad is no longer compromised between
comfort and load/deflection control. The springs control forces while the roller balls 838 are
designed for comfort.
         [00194]     The forehead support provides vertical (relative to a vertical person)
stability. The addition of a gusset, spring or gusset/spring combination to the forehead
                                                  37

supports would provide an active support system that can adapt to changes in mask, user or
strap position. In particular it would decrease the importance of the headgear strap position,
allowing the forehead pads to accommodate a certain level of movement and thus preventing
the requirement to overtighten the headgear straps in order to ensure the mask is stable
through the night.
         [00195]    In one embodiment, the forehead pads may be compressible in the axial
direction towards the forehead support. This may be used in conjunction with a mask having
a cushion with a gusset, and/or headgear with a main strap which has an elasticity that is
selectively adjustable.
         [00196]    In other embodiment, the forehead support or the forehead pad may
include an inflatable bladder or pillow. The pillow may inflate or deflate with changes in
treatment pressure, which in turn may change the distance between the forehead support or
pad and the patient's forehead. The forehead pad may be mounted on such a pillow via the
use of any mechanical expedient, such as sliding pins with a spring, e.g., a silicone spring.
Details of the pillow are described in ResMed Limited's currently pending PCT Application
No. PCT/AU03/01471 filed November 6, 2003, incorporated herein by reference in its
entirety.
         [00197]    A pillow added to the forehead support or pad could effectively act as a
shock absorber. In addition or as an alternative, the pillow may include a progressive spring
constant which changes with pressure. This would help eliminate any adverse effects of
using headgear having a limited range of extensibility.
         [00198]    In another example, the adjustable forehead support may include a
cantilevered spring which extends from the mask to support the forehead support. As such,
the forehead pads will be spring biased against the patient's forehead, but may resiliently flex
in response to changes in strap tension and/or treatment pressure.
         [00199]    In each of these examples, it is desirable to maintain vertical stability
through the pressure range. Such vertical stability may be created via friction between the
forehead pads and the forehead or the cushion and the patient's nose region. Friction
adequate to maintain the mask system in the vertical position can be achieved via the use of
the expedients described above.
         [00200]    In addition, it may be desirable to provide a system that can maintain the
vertical position of the mask assembly. For example, as shown in Fig. 48, the forehead
support may include at least one roller pad 700 which may rotate if it moves in relation to the
                                                38

patient's forehead. A sensor 702 may be provided on one of roller pads 700 to detect the
amount, if any, of rotation of the roller pad 700, to thereby determine how much the mask
assembly has moved in relation to the face.
         [00201]    In another embodiment, the vent cover 840 as shown in Figs. 46 and 47
can be designed such that it is rotatable with respect to the swivel elbow. For example, such
rotation may include 0-360' rotation. As such, the vented air can be diverted in any
direction. As an alternative, the cover may be square-shaped and fit on a complimentary
