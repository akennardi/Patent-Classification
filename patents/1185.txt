                 VALVE REPLACEMENT SYSTEMS AND METHODS
                           BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE
 [0001]       The present disclosure relates to medical interventional systems and methods
 and more particularly, to valve replacement systems and methods. The long-term clinical
 effect of valve regurgitation is well recognized as a significant contributor to
 cardiovascular related morbidity and mortality. In particular, there are two basic
 classifications of mitral regurgitation ("MR"), primary and secondary. Primary MR results
 when there is either direct tissue pathology of the valve structures or there is structural
 damage/alteration of one or more valve structures (leaflets, chordae). Secondary MR
 results from damage to the myocardium and left ventricle resulting in left ventricular
 dilatation, and secondary alteration of mitral valve geometry and functional loss of valve
 competence. Whether valvular in origin leading to a ventricular problem or of
 ventricular/muscle origin leading to the valvular problem, the effect of high levels of MR
 is significant on cardiopulmonary physiology, resulting in significantly elevated left atrial
 pressures and pulmonary pressures, pulmonary congestion, and volume and energy
 overload effects on the myocardium. This physiology creates significant heart failure
 symptoms of shortness of breath and decreased physical endurance, ultimately leading to
 death.
 [0002]        The decision to intervene on a regurgitant mitral valve relates to the level of
 mitral regurgitation, the symptoms of the patient as an indicator of progressive negative
 physiologic effect, and the functional status of the left ventricle, specifically ejection
 fraction. The risk of intervention is weighed against the benefit of MR treatment.
 [0003]       The mitral valve is a therapeutic target of intervention/surgery early in the
 disease process of primary valvular disease because of MR's deleterious effects on
 heart/ventricular function if left untreated. For patients with moderate-severe or severe
 levels of MR combined with even a modest decrease in ejection fraction ("EF"), or the
 development of symptoms, surgical correction is indicated. In this situation, the risk of
 surgery in what is an otherwise healthy patient is far outweighed by the beneficial effects
 of eliminating the long-term negative effects of MR.
 [0004]       A more difficult question has been the patient with secondary or functional
 mitral regurgitation. In this situation, the patient has pre-existing LV dysfunction
 combined with heart failure symptoms, and a developing/worsening level of MR. The

WO 2013/158613                                                               PCT/US2013/036734
                                               2
 risks of intervention in this scenario are much greater. The net benefit of surgically
 intervening to eliminate the MR has not been demonstrated. Symptomatic benefit has been
 seen, but not a net mortality benefit. Therefore, it is usually contemplated or applied
 concomitantly when a patient is undergoing coronary artery bypass graft CABG
 revascularization.
 [0005]       The classification of mitral regurgitation as primary or secondary is a useful to
 differentiate between the underlying disease processes that led to the incompetent valve.
 These provide a starting point that can direct the type and timing of an intervention.
 However, classification is not sufficient to fully describe the issues that direct a
 therapeutic approach. Because the mitral valve is complex structurally, mechanically, and
 physiologically, a more detailed description and understanding of the abnormalities
 associated with mitral regurgitation is needed to direct existing therapies, as well as
 develop new options for therapy.
 [0006]       Pathologic abnormality of the mitral valve tissue is a common cause of primary
 mitral regurgitation. Typical pathologies that occur include rheumatic, myxomatous,
 endocarditis, and Marfan's or other collagen based tissue diseases. Calcification and
 leaflet thickening are also abnormalities associated with direct tissue level changes in the
 valve. These can be either part of a primary tissue based disease or result from a
 long-standing insult to the valve, including regurgitant jetting across the leaflets.
 [0007]       Congenital and acquired structural abnormalities like ruptured chordae, leaflet
 prolapse, fenestrations, and clefts can also be forms of primary valve disease leading to
 mitral regurgitation.
 [0008]       Functional MR results from myocardial damage leading to ventricular
 functional loss and geometric changes that impact the valve coaptation through associated
 annular dilatation and papillary muscle displacement. In pure functional MR, the valve
 structures are not pathologic nor have structural defects, but the geometric alteration leads
 to a loss of coaptation of the mitral valve leaflets, often in the central A2/P2 segment of
 the valve.
 [0009]       As with many multi-factorial clinical problems, one etiologic element (tissue
 pathology, structural alterations, functional/geometric changes) may lead to others
 resulting in a "mixed" picture. This is especially true with mitral regurgitation. In the case

WO 2013/158613                                                               PCT/US2013/036734
                                                3
 of primary MR of either tissue or structural origin, volume overload of the LV can create
 failure and LV dilatation creating a component of functional MR if the valve is left
 untreated. In the case of long standing functional MR, tissue changes can be seen such as
 calcification and thickening caused by the regurgitant jet and high leaflet stresses.
 Muscle/tissue damage to the myocardium in and around the sub-valvular apparatus can
 create structural alteration such as ruptured papillary muscles/chordae and prolapse.
 Excessive tenting of the leaflets associated with significant functional MR can also stress
 the chords causing rupture.
 [0010]       The net result is that MR is a spectrum disorder with many patients having a
 mixed picture of valve abnormalities. This is an important factor in the decisions
 surrounding a mitral valve therapeutic approach, specifically repair or replacement.
 [0011]       The primary goal of any therapy of the mitral valve is to significantly reduce or
 eliminate the regurgitation. By eliminating the regurgitation, the destructive volume
 overload effects on the left ventricle are attenuated. The volume overload of regurgitation
 relates to the excessive kinetic energy required during isotonic contraction to generate
 overall stroke volume in an attempt to maintain forward stroke volume and cardiac output.
 It also relates to the pressure potential energy dissipation of the leaking valve during the
 most energy-consuming portion of the cardiac cycle, isovolumic contraction. Additionally,
 successful MR reduction should have the effect of reducing the elevated pressures in the
 left atrium and pulmonary vasculature reducing pulmonary edema (congestion) and
 shortness of breath symptomatology. It also has a positive effect on the filling profile of
 the left ventricle and the restrictive LV physiology that can result with MR. These
 pathophysiologic issues indicate the potential benefits of MR therapy, but also indicates
 the complexity of the system and the need for a therapy to focus beyond the MR level or
 grade.
 [0012]       It is also desirable to prevent new deleterious physiology or function of the
 valve. The procedure and system used to fix the mitral valve ideally should avoid
 worsening other (non-MR) existing pathologic conditions or creating new pathologic
 conditions as a result of the treatment of the critical factors to be managed is
 Stenosis/gradient. That is, if a valve system is used that does not allow for sufficient LV
 inflow without elevated filling pressures, then critical benefits of MR reduction are
 dissipated or lost. Moreover, atrial fibrillation is to be avoided as it can result if elevated

WO 2013/158613                                                                PCT/US2013/036734
                                                4
 pressures are not relieved by the therapy, or are created by the system (high pressure
 results in atrial stress leading to dilatation ultimately leading to arrhythmias). Also, if the
 procedure results in damage to atrial tissue at surgery, it can result in the negative
 physiologic effect of atrial fibrillation. Further, one should be aware of the possibility of
 increased LV Wall Stress (LV geometry). Due to the integral relationship of the mitral
 valve with LV geometry through the papillary and chordal apparatus, LV wall stress levels
 can be directly affected resulting in alterations of LV filling and contraction mechanics.
 Accordingly, a system that does not preserve or worsens the geometry of the LV can
 counter the benefits of MR reduction because of the alteration of contractile physiology.
 [0013]       It has been generally agreed that it is preferable if the valve can be repaired.
 Repair of valve elements that target the regurgitant jet only allows for minimal alteration
 to the valve elements/structures that are properly functioning allowing for the least
 potential for negatively effecting the overall physiology while achieving the primary goal.
 Native valve preservation can be beneficial because a well repaired valve is considered to
 have a better chance of having long standing durability versus a replacement with an
 artificial valve that has durability limits. Also, while current surgical artificial valves
 attempt chord sparing procedures, the LV geometric relationship may be negatively
 altered if not performed or performed poorly leading to an increase in LV wall stress due
 to an increase in LV diameter. Thus, while preferred and possible for technically
 competent surgeons, the relatively high recurrence rate of MR due to inadequate repair,
 the invasiveness of the surgery especially in sick or functional MR patients, and the
 complexities of a repair for many surgeons lead to a high percentage of mitral operations
 being replacement.
 [0014]       Conventionally, surgical repair or replacement of the mitral valve is performed
 on cardiopulmonary bypass and is usually performed via an open median sternotomy
 resulting in one of the most invasive high risk cardiac surgical operations performed,
 especially in subpopulations such as functional MR. Therefore, a key improvement to
 mitral valve operations is to significantly lower the risk and invasiveness, specifically
 utilizing a percutaneous or minimally invasive technique.
 [0015]       While there have been attempts to replicate existing surgical repair via less
 invasive surgical or percutaneous methods, given the complexity of repairing the valve
 surgically, the efforts have largely been deemed lacking in achieving adequate efficacy

WO 2013/158613                                                              PCT/US2013/036734

 and have not altered the risk benefit ratio sufficiently to warrant ongoing investment,
 approval, or adoption. In particular, there has been a general technology failure due to the
 complexity of anatomy to percutaneously manage with an implant or implantable
 procedure. The broad spectrum of mitral disease directly influences outcomes with a
 resulting inability to match technology with pathology. There has also been observed
 inadequate efficacy with poor surgical replication and safety results. It has also been
 recognized that percutaneous approaches successful to certain valve procedures, such as
 aortic valve replacement associated with a single pathology and a relatively circular rigid
 substrate, mitral valves often suffer from multiple pathologies and a flexible or elastic
 annular with multiple structures.
 [0016]      Accordingly, what is needed is an effective long lasting MR reduction without
 creating negative physiologic consequences to the cardio-pulmonary system (heart, lungs,
 peripheral vasculature) including stenosis, LV wall stress and atrial fibrillation. It is also
 desirable to be able to perform the operation in a reliable, repeatable, and easy to perform
 procedure and to have a broadly applicable procedure for both patients and physicians,
 while employing a significantly less invasive method.
 [0017]      The present disclosure addresses these and other needs.

WO 2013/158613                                                               PCT/US2013/036734

                                          SUMMARY
 [0018]      Briefly and in general terms, the present disclosure is directed towards valve
 replacement and repair systems and methods. In one particular aspect, the present
 disclosure describes a percutaneous or minimally invasive mitral valve replacement
 system that eliminates MR, provides adequate physiologic inflow, and preserves and/or
 improves LV geometry in a reliable, repeatable, and easy to perform procedure.
 [0019]      In one aspect, there is provided a mitral valve replacement system including an
 anchoring structure and an artificial valve configured to treat a native heart. In another
 aspect, there is provided a method of replacing a valve including providing anchor
 structure, advancing a valve delivery catheter into a heart, advancing an artificial valve out
 of the delivery catheter and into the heart, and positioning the artificial valve to treat a
 native heart.
 [0020]      In one approach, the mitral valve replacement system addresses a number of
 basic functional requirements. One requirement is the valve function itself, the occlusion
 of flow during systole, and open to flow during diastole. Another requirement is the seal
 between the artificial replacement valve frame/structure and the tissue to prevent/minimize
 any peri-valvular leaks or flow. A further requirement is the anchoring or securement
 function to hold the functioning valve in position and withstand the substantial and
 variable cyclical load placed on the valve during systolic pressurization of the valve
 surface. It is intended that each of these is met in the durable, therapeutically, and
 physiologically appropriate mitral valve replacement system disclosed herein.
 [0021]     The presently disclosed system may utilize a staged approach to the functional
 elements of the system, starting with the anchoring or securement functional element.
 Additionally, the staging can be performed within a single procedure or in multiple, time
 separated procedures. By staging and separating functional elements, the individual
 elements will be simpler in design and simpler to deploy and implant. This staging of the
 anchor implantation of the present invention provides a stable, reliable, consistent,
 substrate to deliver a replacement valve into the mitral position.
 [0022]     A mitral valve replacement system according to the present disclosure includes
 an anchor element, a sealing element, and a valve element, and utilizes an anchor delivery
 system, and a valve delivery system. More than one element may be incorporated into a

WO 2013/158613                                                              PCT/US2013/036734
                                               7
 structure, for example, an anchor element also may comprise a sealing structure, or a valve
 element may comprise a sealing structure. In accordance with the present teachings, the
 elements of the valve replacement system may be implanted in staged procedures, for
 example, an anchor element may be implanted during a first procedure and a valve
 element may be implanted during a second procedure. As disclosed herein, the processes,
 systems used for implantation, and timing of implantation may vary. The present
 disclosure further contemplates that the anchor element (and in some cases sealing
 element) of the disclosed mitral valve replacement system may be used with existing valve
 technologies, as discussed further below. Similarly, delivery systems may include those
 disclosed herein, but the present disclosure also contemplates that existing delivery
 systems may be used to deliver prior art valve structures.
 [0023]     Thus, in various approaches, a stable, reliable, consistent substrate is created by
 implanting an anchor structure to secure a valve without disruption of native valve
 function until an artificial valve is operational. Further, an anchor structure that
 predictably accepts an artificial valve and will seal the tissue and an implant interface is
 provided as is an anchor delivery system that can accurately, simply, and reliably deliver
 anchor substrate structure while maintaining native valve function. In one particular
 aspect, a supra-annular ring with commissural anchors is provided, two commissural
 anchors sized and shaped to correspond to valve commissures and a third anchor for
 placement at a second anchor location. Anchor delivery can involve individual, releasable
 control elements such that in situ access to each anchoring location is provided in order to
 deploy tissue penetrating structures for securement. Catheter/tube access is contemplated
 as is over-the-wire access.
 [0024]     It is also contemplated that current valve technologies can be leveraged. A valve
 to anchor interface can involve a geometric interlock, to thereby allow the flexibility for
 adaptation to a broad spectrum of valve technology. In this regard, a valve to native valve
 interface preserves sub-valvular structure relationships.
 [0025]     Moreover, the valve anchor approach can fundamentally alter the complexity of
 performing a completely percutaneous mitral replacement by creating a reliable and
 consistent substrate. Thus, it is intended that the implant design exploit the
 geometry/mechanics of the commissures to create sufficient holding capability. Further,
 design and delivery approaches that maintain native valve function providing the ability to

                                             8
 completely separate and stage the implantation of the system functional components is
 contemplated as are delivery methods that have potential for quick fluoroscopic delivery,
 positioning, and deployment. Consequently, there is an optimal valve performance
 opportunity due to maximal design flexibility and technology leveraging, and a delivery
 capability to achieve precise positioning prior to valve deployment. The same creates
 desired tissue/implant sealing and maintains sub-valvular structural relationships.
 [0026]     Accordingly, employing the present system and method facilitates effective long
 lasting MR reduction without creating negative physiologic consequences to the cardio
 pulmonary system (heart, lungs, peripheral vasculature) including stenosis, LV wall stress,
 and atrial fibrillation. The method can involve performance of the operation in a reliable,
 repeatable, and easy to perform procedure and is a broadly applicable procedure for both
 patients and physicians. A significantly less invasive method results, one which can be
 fully percutaneous from the start.
 [0027]       Other features and advantages of the present disclosure will become apparent
 from the following detailed description, taken in conjunction with the accompanying
 drawings, which illustrate, by way of example, the principles of the invention.

            DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
 [00182]      Referring now to the drawings, which are provided by way of background and
 example, and not limitation, the present disclosure relates to medical interventional
 procedures and devices. In various aspects, heart valve repair is addressed and in
 particular, mitral valve replacement approaches are presented.
 [00183]      With reference to FIGS. 1A-B, there is shown a graphical representation of a
 potential patient population suffering from MR. Patients are classified by valve
 abnormality versus the severity of symptoms (i.e. ejection fraction). A decision to be
 made involves whether to replace or repair the subject valve. However, it has been found
 that a majority of patients with MR are left untreated. This is especially true with
 functional MR. It has been determined that such patients can be treated using a
 percutaneous mitral valve replacement approach.
 [00184]      In open surgical valve replacement, the valve is implanted in its functional
 configuration and size. Additionally, conventional artificial surgical valves have a sewing
 ring around their perimeter that is directly attached to the valve annulus tissue with
 multiple sutures to provide both the securement and sealing functions. The surgical
 approach requires sternotomy, the heart to be stopped (cardiopulmonary bypass) and the
 atrium to be opened.
 [00185]      For less invasive, beating heart approaches to valve replacement, (such as is
 performed in the aortic valve) whether trans-apical access or endovascular access
 (venous/antegrade, arterial/retrograde), the valve is not in a functional configuration and is
 in a compressed state to aid deployment. This requires the valve to be deployed by some
 means to achieve its functional configuration and size. These procedural operations of
 deploying a functional valve, a tissue sealing structure, and a load bearing anchor structure
 that is solidly secured and sealed to the native anatomic location must be performed
 quickly and remotely to accommodate the desired less invasive and beating heart
 implantation. This combination of multiple deployable elements with multiple functional
 requirements of the composite system dramatically increases the complexity of the system
 and procedure.
 [00186]      In general, the most difficult of the three functions to reliably achieve can be
 the anchoring function due to the variable and cyclical load requirements and the

WO 2013/158613                                                             PCT/US2013/036734
                                              21
 complexity of the anatomic structures of the native mitral valve. The sealing function of
 the system is similarly difficult because of the pressure requirements and again, the
 complexity of the anatomic structures of the native mitral valve. The simplest is the
 deployable valve functional element, as the TAVI experience provides a basis for the
 starting point design structures and mechanisms.
 [00187]     It is desirable to have a simple and repeatable procedure to deliver a highly
 functional and long lasting valve system requires a different approach than currently being
 pursued by others in the field.
 [00188]     In particular, a mitral valve replacement system according to the present
 disclosure includes an anchor element, a sealing element, and a valve element, and utilizes
 an anchor delivery system, and a valve delivery system. More than one element may be
 incorporated into a structure, for example, an anchor element also may comprise a sealing
 structure, or a valve element may comprise a sealing structure. In accordance with the
 present teachings, the elements of the valve replacement system may be implanted in
 staged procedures, for example, an anchor element may be implanted during a first
 procedure and a valve element may be implanted during a second procedure. As disclosed
 herein, the processes, systems used for implantation, and timing of implantation may vary.
 The present disclosure further contemplates that the anchor element (and in some cases
 sealing element) of the disclosed mitral valve replacement system may be used with
 existing valve structures, as discussed further below. Similarly, delivery systems may
 include those disclosed herein, but the present disclosure also contemplates that existing
 delivery systems may be used to deliver prior art valve structures.
 [00189]     It should be noted that in planned percutaneous structural heart interventions
 (TAVI, mitral repair, mitral replacement) (i.e. percutaneous), there are at least two
 procedures performed for each individual patient. The first procedure includes a diagnostic
 assessment and possible PCI/stenting of the patient's coronary arteries and often includes
 a right heart cath for cardiac physiology assessment. Valve implantation and or repair is
 not performed prior to knowing the patient has been previously completely revascularized
 if necessary.
 [00190]     As mentioned, generally the most difficult and most significant requirement for
 a less invasive valve system is the anchoring attachment of the system. The presently

WO 2013/158613                                                                PCT/US2013/036734
                                               22
 disclosed mitral valve replacement system staging of the anchor implantation allows
 exploitation of various anatomic valve and ventricular structures to achieve the required
 holding force of the anchor system. When performed in two time separated procedures,
 staging the implantation of the anchor separately from other system elements provides
 time for tissue ingrowth into the anchor structure and resultant strengthening of the overall
 holding force of the anchor structure in the anatomy.
 [00191]      Staging of anchor implantation allows for maintaining native valve function
 until artificial valve element(s) are in place.
 [00192]      Anchor element embodiments disclosed herein may utilize and exploit
 anatomic structures and geometry to attain the required mechanical holding forces whether
 engaged acutely or chronically with the addition of tissue ingrowth of the anchor.
 [00193]      As noted above, the sealing element (non-valvular) can either be a structure
 distinct from the primary tissue anchor or valve elements, in combination with the anchor,
 or in combination with the valve. When provided in combination with the anchor
 structure, a possibility is that the sealing and anchoring functions can both benefit from
 tissue ingrowth and incorporation of the anchor implant structure. This would allow for a
 sealed tissue/anchor implant interface that could be engaged by the valve structure element
 without the need for additional structures/elements to seal between the valve and tissue.
 [00194]      This situation provides the stable, predictable substrate to receive and deploy
 an artificial valve into the mitral position. The predictable substrate significantly alters and
 reduces the requirements placed on the valve for both delivery and deployment, making it
 more analogous to the aortic percutaneous valves that utilize the generally circular, tubular
 and solid (calcified) aortic root to attach and seal. It may even provide the benefit of
 having a more reliable substrate due to the lack of calcified deposits that affect valve shape
 and function in the current TAVI valves that can lead to peri-valvular leaks.
 [00195]      Yet another aspect of staging is the ability to stage the actual valve/occluder
 function. In this approach, a non-functional valve structure could be deployed in the same
 procedure as that of the implantation of anchor and sealing structures, but since the valve
 is non-functional, the loads encountered by the system would be significantly less than
 those encountered by a fully functional valve, reducing the load placed on the anchor
 element. As the anchor and sealing structures grow into and are incorporated in the

WO 2013/158613                                                                PCT/US2013/036734
                                               23
 tissue/existing anatomy, the holding capability of these structures increases until such time
 as the valve/occluder function is deployed, either automatically (e.g., suture dissolving
 over time) or by some trigger mechanism or actuation during a second procedure. This
 actuation could be achieved remotely without invading the body (e.g., RF or
 ultrasound-like actuation).
 [00196]      The valve replacement system according to the present disclosure allows for
 valve delivery flexibility without, or only minor non-critical, alteration of the final
 implant. Specifically, tissue valves can be delivered either via a fully percutaneous
 procedure or a minimally invasive surgical delivery of the valve without modification to
 the valve implant to accommodate the alternative route.
 [00197]      Another aspect of staged implantation of anchor and valve structures is that
 previously developed technology for deployable valves in the aortic position may be able
 to be extensively leveraged for use in the mitral position, i.e., minimal modification of
 existing valve structures may permit their use in the mitral space.
 [00198]      Yet another aspect of having a stable consistent anchor platform for receiving a
 valve structure is that it allows for valve sizing that is appropriate for the patient
 population (FMR, structural, mixed) and even specific to the patient being treated. In other
 words, it allows for the largest valve possible in every patient rather than compromising
 size (smaller than physiologically desired) to accommodate technology limitations in
 systems that must combine multiple (increase complexity) valve, attachment, sealing and
 delivery structures.
 [00199]      The system according to the present teachings also allows for therapeutic
 flexibility of the artificial valve. The presently disclosed system allows for beating heart
 implantation of both tissue and mechanical valves. As disclosed herein, delivery systems
 are provided that allow implantation of mechanical valves via either a trans-apical or
 trans-atrial thorascopic route.
 [00200]      Overall, the present disclosure describes a system including a platform anchor,
 valve, and delivery technology that allows therapeutic flexibility (mitral replacement with
 either tissue or mechanical valves), implantation flexibility via either fully percutaneous or
 minimally invasive (trans-apical, trans-atrial) procedures, minimized delivery complexity

WO 2013/158613                                                                PCT/US2013/036734
                                               24
 to allow a simple to perform procedure, and a patient population that is not restricted by
 the underlying pathology.
 [00201]      It is contemplated that the structural substrate of the mitral annular be
 managed. Also, the mitral annulus is typically nonplanar, non-circular in shape, flexible
 and distensible. These all contribute to a complex substrate to effectively attach an
 artificial valve, and specifically the anchor structure. Complex valve/ventricle structural
 relationships should be managed. The apparatus of the mitral valve includes multiple
 leaflets with multiple lines of coaptation all connected via chordae tendinae at the leaflet
 tips to the LV wall or papillary muscles. This creates possible of entanglement of system
 elements during implantation and if the subvalvular apparatus is not maintained or is
 damaged, the LV geometry may be negatively altered increasing LV wall stress and
 reducing overall cardiac function in spite of the artificial valve eliminating MR.
 Moreover, the load requirement are contemplated to be managed. The static functional
 load on the implanted artificial valve may be calculated by Valve area x Trans-valvular
 (LV pressure - left atrium pressure) pressure. This is generally approximately 3 pounds
 with a range of 1-4 pounds. Because the mitral valve is in a cyclical flowing system, the
 requirements of handling the pressure load is accentuated by a closure or impact load
 created by stopping the momentum effect of the LV pressurized blood. The blood that
 starts to flow back towards the atrium during systole must be decelerated. And diverted to
 the aortic outflow.
 [00202]      Another aspect is consideration of the anchor implant is the load distribution or
 force per unit of area of anchor attachment. This can be at a level that does not allow the
 anchor structure(s) to pull out of the tissue once attached. One mechanism to minimize is
 to have a relatively rigid anchor frame such to help distribute the valve load across the
 entire anchor surface in contact or attached with the tissue. Another mechanism is to have
 multiple points of attachment along the anchor. The tissue anchor geometry is another
 structural design consideration in order to prevent tissue migration or pull through due to
 excessive local forces or tissue necrosis that can be encountered when the tissue is
 overcompressed. To maximize acute mechanical hold in the tissue, the profile geometry
 of the anchor tissue element can be designed to maximize the breadth and depth of tissue
 engagement as well as the surface width and geometry of the penetrating element. The
 tissue used to provide the holding force for the anchor can be exploited such that certain

WO 2013/158613                                                                PCT/US2013/036734
                                              25
 regions of the mitral valve have greater intrinsic tensile strength (e.g. trigone region) or
 utilize tissue that has a response that enhances the extent (thickness, area) of ingrowth (LV
 muscle wall). The tissue collagen orientation in certain regions needs to be accounted for
 if it is small chain, non-oriented fibers or can be used to maximize hold if it is larger chain
 and oriented collagen.
 [00203]       Due to the continuous and cyclical loads and motion of the system, anchor
 device biostability can be required, specifically fatigue resistance, corrosion resistance and
 overall mechanical durability. One of the system elements is intended to interface with
 tissue to form a seal. This can be the anchor forming the seal and the valve seals to the
 anchor, or the anchor holds valve and a valve element seals to the tissue. The implanted
 valve interface to anchor can provide sufficient and stable holding capability with a
 transfer of the valve load effectively onto the anchor. This may be accomplished by a
 frictional fit via expansion (balloon, self) of the valve into the anchor and/or tissue or a
 mechanical interlock mechanism between the anchor and valve. Further, the anchor
 implant structure can be a biocompatible device, including specific biocompatibility for
 blood contact and tissue contact.
 [00204]       The specific anatomic locations that may provide mechanical and structural
 attachment of the anchor is another area of consideration. The anchor may be designed to
 incorporate one or more of a commissural location such as the anterior trigone region or
 the posterior leaflet cleft. An attachment location could also be the anterior portion of an
 atrial wall, or at an annular region/surface (posterior or anterior). Leaflet capture is also
 contemplated such as at the sub-posterior leaflet or the sub commissural leaflet.
 Attachment can also be at or within the left ventricle (endocardial) such as to the posterior
 wall (including posterior leaflet capture or a papillary space wedge), the
 apical/sub-papillary, the anterior/posterior wall bridge, or transmurally (septal, free wall,
 apex).
 [00205]       The anchor itself can include various approaches to support the skeletal
 structure. In one approach, the structure can be a supra-valvular structure with
 commissural feet. The commissural feet/projections can be structures which are
 multi-functional elements that can provide mechanical/geometric anchoring, penetration
 (needle/barb like) securement, and tissue based incorporation (in-growth) including
 subvalvular/sub-leaflet structures that extend into the LV wall, all of which do not

WO 2013/158613                                                               PCT/US2013/036734
                                              26
 interrupt leaflet, chordae or native valve function. Also, they can provide a positioning
 basis for the entire anchor because of their engagement with the commissural clefts in the
 anterior and posterior leaflets while still avoiding interaction or disruption of the chordae
 or native leaflets. More detail on specific methods of the anchor/tissue interface are
 described below.
 [00206]      The ring or top structure can be designed to provide a relatively circular,
 non-distensible, non-elongating homogeneous frame substrate that the artificial valve can
 engage and attach to during its deployment. This can be adapted to function much like the
 calcified aortic root for TAVI without the in-homogeneity or need for pre-dilatation. This
 structure may be continuous or interrupted, and completely around annulus or only
 partially around annular circumference. In particular, it can be sinusoidal in plane of valve
 leaflets trying to create continuous attachment around entire circumference (each sinusoid
 comes in and out of plane) or sinusoidal perpendicular to valve bridging from point to
 point creating, multiple attachment points, thereby allowing for tissue ingrowth between
 sinusoidal points of native leaflet or annulus tissue contact/engagement. The anchor can
 be malleable with points of attachment between commissures, a single wire or multiple
 connected wire components, or be formed into a saddle configuration to approximate
 natural saddle geometry of valve (may be based off of 3d echo or CT to determine
 geometry).
 [00207]      There may further be a covering of the skeletal frame. The covering of the
 anchor skeleton can provide opportunity for facilitating collagen tissue ingrowth into or
 onto the implant structure and/or covering in locations such as on top (atrial side) of leaflet
 or annulus, at side of leaflets or annulus, at a ventricular wall at sub-valvular level, or
 underneath (ventricular side) of the leaflet or commissures.
 [00208]      A superstructure above the valve annulus may provide options for valve
 attachment to the anchor or even an alternative therapy such as mitral repair via a septal
 lateral cinch. Various superstructures above the annulus can include A2 P2 points of
 attachment, two circles to allow for double aortic valves, or use of the atrial wall behind
 A2 or P2.
 [00209]      Materials for components used in multiple combinations and configurations,
 may include metals, especially for the anchor skeleton or frame structures such as Nitinol

WO 2013/158613                                                              PCT/US2013/036734
                                              27
 because of its superelasticity and ability to be compressed into a deliverable shape/state
 and then deployed into a functional state, titanium due to its strength and biocompatibility,
 SST: hardened for its strength or malleable to aid in conforming to shape,
 cobalt/chromium alloy for strength and known valve component implant history; or
 composites to provide multiple properties based on anatomic location. Tissue elements
 also may be incorporated on the anchor implant to aid overall function of holding or tissue
 engagement and sealing including pericardial (bovine, ovine, porcine) tissue or valve
 tissue (bovine, ovine, porcine). Further synthetic polymers can be used as biocompatible
 elements in implants and on the anchor due to their know tissue and blood compatibility
 properties. These can include Elast-Eon (a silicone and urethane copolymer), ePTFE,
 urethane, silicone, PEEK, polyester (PET), or UHMWP.
 [00210]     The anchor implant can use one or more mechanisms to achieve the stable,
 reliable, and consistent holding forces necessary for the overall system. The anterior
 commissural/trigoneal region has been found to be a consistent and predictable anatomic
 feature across multiple patient populations. The projections or feet placed in this area will
 have minimal or no impact on native leaflet and valve functions. It is also an area that
 accommodates the anchor structure to have contact with the supra, intra, and sub valvular
 structures including the LV wall beneath and behind the commissural leaflet. The tissue
 substrate of this area is also very advantageous as the trigone/annulus consists of highly
 organized and strong collagen and the well perfused muscle tissue provides a good
 ingrowth substrate for added chronic stability.
 [00211]     Geometric/mechanical holding force for anchor that exploits the geometry/
 configuration of anatomic structures (relative to force vector) to achieve the necessary
 holding force required by a deployed artificial valve or other therapeutic element is further
 contemplated. The force vector encountered by the anchor structure's commissural
 projections are substantially under shear loading verses a perpendicular load relative to the
 tissue. Commissural projections or foot elements that are able to deploy behind the
 anterior and posterior leaflets in the cul de sac where the leaflet meets the annulus
 provides for direct mechanical holding capability. The commissural projections of the
 anchor structure connected and bridged to each other provide an ability to create a
 mechanical wedge structure to resist the force and hold the valve in position. LV wall
 projections of the commissural feet can provide for the ability to develop deep tissue

WO 2013/158613                                                                PCT/US2013/036734
                                               28
 penetration elements into the muscle, wider elements to increase surface area of
 contact/attachment, and longer projections to increase capability. Moreover, because the
 projections can be placed such that they are Supra annular and Sub-annular, a C like
 structure in cross section can be utilized that is either connected or clamped. With regard
 to tissue penetration based securement, direct mechanical holding force is contemplated
 for an anchor that utilizes the natural strength of the LV and leaflet tissues to hold onto
 anchor structure. These elements can be configured to either be inserted into the tissue and
 resist pull out (barb like), or they may go into and out of tissue to provide a tissue "bite"
 like a stitch, or both elements can be employed. The structure can be located posterior
 annulus or entire annular perimeter, or adjacent leaflet tissue, the trigone/anterior annulus,
 an endocardial LV surface or LV Muscle tissue. Further, the tissue penetration
 securement elements can be linear (staple or nail like), helical (rotation axis is
 perpendicular to tissue interface or rotation axis is parallel to tissue interface
 (in/out/in/out)), curved and or curled, or bent (L shaped or S shaped).
 [00212]       It is also contemplated to use chronic ingrowth to provide long term stable
 implantation of the artificial valve and proper sealing function. In addition, chronic
 ingrowth of implant structural elements can serve as a fundamental mechanism to achieve
 the necessary holding force of the anchor functional element of the system. It exploits the
 natural healing response to foreign bodies placed into tissue and the blood stream to
 develop a strong collagen based tissue connection between the implant surface structures
 and the native valve tissue with a possible endothelial surface. This can be achieved while
 still managing the response to prevent unwanted damage to anatomic structures, damage to
 blood elements, or creation of thromboemboli.
 [00213]       More areas of consideration are the surface composition elements, specifically
 the material choice and texture to promote tissue reaction and device incorporation with
 maximal force holding capability. These elements can also be incorporated onto the tissue
 penetration elements to further increase the holding force by incorporation deep into tissue
 rather than just at the surface. The anchor can have a gross surface modification (barbs,
 slits), a surface texture/ pores to promote ingrowth and mechanical hold, a fabric material
 covering (Dacron velour, double velour, ePTFE), a wire brush (multiple short wire
 elements) or an adhesive. There can further be a single or multiple points of attachment,
 planar attachment or by way of a confluent surface. Moreover, the tissue/anchor interface

WO 2013/158613                                                              PCT/US2013/036734
                                              29
 can be rigid or flexible and can include a wire frame structure that puts a compressive
 force onto surface contact interface to promote increased response. Also, tissue surface
 modification can include an abrasive, a chemical irritant to promote inflammatory
 response or application of heat.
 [00214]     In current conventional approaches to valvular intervention, a diagnostic
 echocardiograph is initially performed to assess valve function followed by two
 percutaneous procedures. First, a diagnostic angiography is performed with or without a
 right heart catheterization to assess, for example, whether they might also require
 revascularization first, prior to valve intervention. Here, patients do not receive valve
 therapy without the patient being fully revascularized. Thereafter, at a different time and
 place, valve replacement therapy is performed involving fixation/attachment,
 accomplishing a tissue sealing interface, and valve deployment and then release. In
 contrast, the presently described approach, however, can include an assessment involving
 a diagnostic echocardiography followed by a unique percutaneous valve procedure
 sequencing. First, a diagnostic angiography (+ / - right heart cath) can be performed along
 with anchor fixation/attachment and anchor/tissue sealing. Subsequently, either later or
 during the same interventional procedure, valve replacement therapy can occur involving
 valve deployment and release. Thus, since the anchor implant allows the native valve to
 remain functional, the anchor implantation procedure could be added to the end of the
 angio (+ / - PCI), and not require a separate interventional procedure. A quick, simple,
 and reliable anchor deployment could permit a fully ingrown structure that significantly
 enhances the holding force of a subsequently implanted replacement valve. Tissue
 ingrowth of the entire anchor perimeter, or at key positions thereon, can in fact provide
 the necessary tissue seal in advance of valve deployment. Moreover, the anchor design
 could be simplified due to less required acute holding force. Therefore, a tissue
 incorporated and healed anchor provides a structure to perform several methods of annular
 adjustment, including plication, reduction annuloplasty, and septal-lateral cinching.
 [00215]     There are certain desirable anchoring locations for an anchor implant. Direct
 attachment to tissue is contemplated at locations adjacent the mitral valve, as are locations
 for placement of anchor projections at leaflet cleft locations. Again, it is intended that
 there be low or no impact to native leaflet function as a result of the implantation of an
 anchor implant, so as to maintain the pre-existing native valve function until a replacement

WO 2013/158613                                                              PCT/US2013/036734
                                              30
 valve is implanted. At the mitral valve 50 (See FIGS. 2A-2E), there is of course the mitral
 annulus 52 defining structure from which the anterior leaflet 54 and posterior position
 leaflet 56 extend and articulate. Between the anterior and posterior leaflets 54, 56 are
 commissural leaflets 58. The trigones 60 are positioned at a perimeter of the anterior
 leaflet 54 and adjacent the commissural leaflet 58. Commissures 62 are the openings or
 slits dividing the anterior leaflet 54 form the commissural leaflets, and positioned near the
 trigones 60. Such structure defines consistent and predictable anatomical features across
 patients. Notably, the high collagen annular trigone 60 generally can be relied upon to
 present a strong anchoring location. The muscle tissue in this area also provides a good
 ingrowth substrate for added stability. There is also a potential for sub-leaflet attachment
 for more stability (See FIG. 2C). Accordingly, primary anchoring locations 62, 64 for an
 anchor implant are included in FIGS. 2D and 2E.
 [00216]      Turning now to FIGS. 3-5, there is shown one embodiment of an anchor
 implant 100 configured for atrial anchoring and implantation within the heart 102 at the
 mitral valve annulus 104. The anchor implant defines a supra-annular ring sized and
 shaped to be placed at the annulus, and includes commissural projections 106. As shown
 in FIG. 3, the projections 106 can be placed at an anterior commissural trigone 108. As
 described above, the commissural projections 106 are configured to extend between
 leaflets 109 without interfering with their functions (See FIG. 4). Moreover, as shown, the
 implant 100 includes a generally circular body 110 which can be formed from a wire or
 other structure, and the projections 106 are loops extending away from a plane defined by
 the circular body 110. It is to be further recognized that the body 110 includes a pair of
 bends 112 configured on opposite sides of the projections 106 to thereby provide
 necessary stress relief and clearance for the placement of the projections between leaflets
 109. Furthermore as noted previously, the anchor 100 can be covered with various
 materials, such as PET and ePTFE, so as to present a desired biocompatible surface to
 body tissue.
 [00217]      As shown in FIGS. 6-10, various other approaches to the anchor implant are
 contemplated. As before, the anchor 120 can be placed at the mitral valve annulus 104
 with projections extending beyond and between the leaflets 109. The projections 125 can
 be one or more of an expanding structure deployed through the coaptation line and below
 the leaflet 109 thereby capturing the anterior and posterior leaflet adjacent the

WO 2013/158613                                                               PCT/US2013/036734
                                             31
 commissures (See FIG. 7) or can define a piercing anchor 126 (See FIG. 8). In a further
 aspect, the piercing anchor 126 can be deployed in the P2 segment 128 of the posterior
 mitral valve leaflet, for example (See FIG. 9), so that the leaflet is punctured and captured
 by the anchor 120. Thus, a further secure attachment in anatomy can be achieved by way
 of expanding anchor or piercing anchor structure.
 [00218]     Two additional approaches to penetrating projections for use in connection
 with an anchor implant are shown in FIGS. 11 and 12. In one approach (FIG. 11), a
 projection 130 can form a hook-like member with a barb 132 at its terminal end. Such
 structure defines a geometric interference with wall anatomy below a leaflet and the
 barbed end 132 penetrates the tissue of the LV to provide a secure attachment.
 Alternatively, a projection 134 can be configured to penetrate commissural anatomy and
 terminate with a T-bar 136 which engages an external wall of the LV to thereby provide a
 secure attachment.
 [00219]     Non-penetration or non-piercing projections are also contemplated. As shown
 in FIG. 13, a projection 140 can be contoured to match a profile of the wall beneath a
 leaflet, and further include a foot pad 142 for engaging tissue. As shown in FIGS. 14 and
 15, the anchor implant can include a plurality of projections 144 having a looped shape
 and including webbing 146 for tissue ingrowth. Here, the looped structure of the
 projections 144 include a neck sized to fit between commissural slits and about
 commissural leaflets, the loop structures residing below the leaflet and against the LV wall
 to provide a secure engagement.
 [00220]     In another approach (See FIGS. 16-19), the anchor implant 150 can define an
 expandable body. In a compressed or contracted state (FIG. 16), the anchor implant 150 is
 smaller for delivering to an implantation site, whereupon the anchor 150 is expanded (FIG.
 18) to securely engage tissue. The implant can include a first convex side member 152
 configured between a pair of concave members 154. The junctions between the members
 can be looped to provide desired stress relief and a platform against which the convex
 member 154 can expand or open. Temporary restraining bands 156 are placed about the
 looped structure at the junction between the convex member 152 and each of the concave
 members 154. Further as shown in FIGS. 17 and 19, external surfaces of the member 152,
 154 can be equipped with tissue penetrating structure such as arrow-like barbs 158 or fish
 hooks 160. One approach to converting the anchor implant 150 from its contracted state

WO 2013/158613                                                             PCT/US2013/036734
                                             32
 to its expanded state is to employ an expandable member such as that of a balloon catheter
 (not shown). At an implantation site (See FIG. 18), the expandable member is placed
 within an interior of the members 152, 154 and expanded to facilitate the conversion of the
 concave members 154 to convex members. Such action overcomes the restraining bands
 156 and facilitates the advancement of the tissue penetrating structure with tissue.
 [00221]      Another approach to structure for penetrating tissue is shown in FIGS. 20 and
 21. Here, the penetration structure is embodied in a staple-like structure 162 including a
 pair of spaced arms 164 joined at a U 166. Angled barbs 168 are further provided on
 lateral sides of the arm 164 to provide a further secure engagement to tissue. In one
 approach, the staples 162 are deployed about an anchor implant such that the U structure
 166 captures the anchor implant and the arms with barbs secure the anchor in place. A
 threaded base 170 is further provided to connect the staple 162 to a push rod or wire
 delivery system (not shown). In this way, one or a plurality of staples 162 can be
 advanced to the implantation site to help securely set an anchor implant.
 [00222]      Various other approaches to an anchor implant are shown in FIGS. 22-38.
 FIG. 22 depicts an implant 180 embodying a generally figure 8 shape connected at its
 middle by a connection cord 182. A pair of commissural projections or feet 184 are
 further provided and spaced along the implant to reflect contouring of commissures
 (points A and B) of a heart valve. The feet 184 can define loops held in shape by a
 retaining band 186. Another elongate loop 187 is formed at one end of the connector cord
 182 and is configured to extend laterally. The assembly can be further provided with
 webbing 188 for tissue ingrowth, the contour of the figure 8-shape and the elongate loop
 187 providing structure across which the webbing extends to define a generally circular
 overall implant body structure, with the feet 189 extending therefrom.
 [00223]      The approach to the anchor implant 190 shown in FIG. 23 also is embodied in
 an assembly having a generally round or circular profile. The implant 190 includes a
 generally circular wire frame 192 having a covering and a plurality of feet, two of which
 are intended to pass through valve commissures and a third positioned at a P2 location. A
 flexible fabric web 194 is configured across the wire frame 192, the web being centered
 about center points 196 of the valve and including a pair of triangular sections 197 joined
 by a middle band web section 198.

                                              33
 [00224]     An anchor implant having a generally T-shaped frame 200 is shown in FIG. 24.
 At a base of the T-frame is a commissural foot 202 configured for P2 attachment, whereas
 the ends of the T-bar of the frame include commissural feet 204. An expandable web
 fabric membrane 206 extends between the curvilinear members defining the T-shape
 frame 200. As shown in FIG. 25, the T-shaped frame 200 can further include a pair of
 limited elongation flexible cords 208 each extending from the commissural feet 202 at the
 base of the T-shape frame 200 to one end of the T-bar of the frame.
 [00225]     In yet another approach (FIGS. 26-27), an anchor implant 210 can be embodied
 in structure designed to prevent turning of an artificial valve attached to the implant 210,
 and to help in proper seating. Commissural feet 212 are configured as before, that is to
 reside between and below natural valve commissures. The wire frame of the implant 210
 includes further larger loops 214 of varying sizes and angled in a manner to engage
 anterior and posterior walls of the left atrium to thereby provide lever point support
 against rotation and structure including the frame from sliding through a valve orifice.
 Flexible cords 216 are further provided to retain the shape of the large loops during
 subsequent implantation of a replacement valve.
 [00226]     Bar-like anchors are also contemplated (See FIGS. 28-38). In one approach as
 shown in FIGS. 28 and 29, the anchor implant 220 can be embodied in a cross-member
 222 sized to span a full area of a commissural leaflet. The ends of the cross-member are
 provided with broad pads 224, a top portion 226 of which covers the commissural leaflet
 and can act to minimize leaking in this area. A bottom portion 228 of the broad pads 224
 can include a projection through a commissural of the leaflet, thus providing an anchor
 function.
 [00227]     As shown in FIGS. 30-32, the anchor implant 230 can include an intra-annular
 commissural anchoring frame 232 sized and shaped to receive an artificial valve, or can
 alternatively be employed to hold another anchor implant in place during a healing and
 tissue ingrowth stage. Opposite ends of the implant 230 are curved members 234 which
 are intended to conform to local anatomy, and extend from above the annulus (intra-atrial),
 through valve commissures, and to within the LV. Texturing or tissue fabric can be
 associated or configured upon the member 234. The cross-member 236 connecting the
 ends of the implant 230 also defines a curved member designed to reside in the atrium and

WO 2013/158613                                                              PCT/US2013/036734
                                             34
 further includes a band 238 providing both strain relief and support structure to the cross
 member 236.
 [00228]     Another anchoring frame 240 is shown in FIGS. 33-35. Here, opposite ends of
 the implant are curved members 242 which are sized and shaped to conform to local
 anatomy and extend from above the annulus, through valve commissures, and to within
 the LV. The cross-member 244 extends from both ends of the curved end members, and
 thus is intended to reside below valve annulus. Cross member 244 resides between the
 chordal tent of the anterior leaflet chordae and posterior leaflet chordae with the lateral
 ends extending between the individual chordae out to the LV wall. Because the cross
 member 244 is a loop like structure it does not entangle in the chordae, stays between the
 respective anterior and posterior leaflet chords, and helps orient the cross member parallel
 to the commissure to commissure line.
 [00229]     In an alternative approach (FIGS. 36-3 8), a bar-like, anchor frame 250 has a
 generally omega profile sized to span the heart atrium. The ends of the frame 252 are
 shaped to conform to anatomy, and also extend through valve commissures. The curved
 bar 254 connecting the shaped ends is sized and shaped to reside above the valve annulus.
 [00230]     Moreover, as shown in FIGS. 39-43, it is further contemplated that a ring frame
 of an anchor implant can reside in multiple planes. That is, the frame can embody a saddle
 shape 260 configured to accommodate the curvature of a valve annulus such as of the
 mitral valve (FIG. 39). The frame can further include an arc section 262 configured to
 accommodate the curvature of the inter-trigone anterior leaflet (See FIG. 40). Moreover,
 the anchor frame can include a serpentine shape 264 (FIG. 41) intended to accommodate
 dimensional and shape variations of the native annulus. The curves of the serpentine
 pattern can be perpendicular to the native annulus as shown in FIG. 41, or they can extend
 horizontally with respect to the annulus as shown in FIG. 42, or of course a combined
 approach to undulations may be desirable.
 [00231]     With reference to FIG. 43, it is also contemplated that a wire frame anchor
 implant can include adjustable sub-structure for accommodating perimeter variations of a
 valve annulus. Here, a delivery tube 270 can be configured to advance or retract sections
 of a wire implant to best fit it to anatomy. Excess length would be severed and removed.
 In one approach, lengths of posterior frame wire can be so adjusted, leaving unchanged an

WO 2013/158613                                                              PCT/US2013/036734
                                             35
 anterior frame portion 272, and commissural extension 274. Other areas of an anchor
 implant can also be likewise adjusted as desired.
 [00232]       Next, various approaches to anchor attachments are presented. As shown in
 FIG. 44, a direct mechanical load can be placed behind a leaflet 109 to provide structural
 support to an anchor. As previously stated, it is further contemplated that the robust
 anatomy of collagen annulus or a trigone can be relied upon to receive piercing anchors
 (See FIGS. 45A-45B) such as fish-hook 286 or arrowhead-like 288 structure. It has been
 found that muscle attachment provides excellent ingrowth for stable long term anchoring.
 Shear loading is depicted in FIG. 45C and deeper (FIG. 45D), wider (FIG. 45E) and longer
 areas (FIG. 45F) of anchor penetration are also contemplated. By taking one or more of
 these approaches, desired and increased holding capability is achieved.
 [00233]       As shown in FIGS. 46-49, one specific approach to a commissural projection
 of an anchor implant can assume a pair of loops 290. Such loops are intended to be sized
 so that they can reside under and behind a leaflet 109. Moreover, it is contemplated that
 the anchor projection be made from flexible and elastic material and be able to be inserted
 in a straightened configuration within a delivery tube 292. A delivery tube 292 can be
 employed for each anchor projection 290, and a connection delivery wire 294 is further
 provided to control positioning. Thus, the delivery wire 294 can be withdrawn or
 otherwise disengaged from the anchor projection 290, and to thereby permit release to be
 reconfigured into its looped configuration. This can be done either before or after ejection
 from the anchor projection 290 from within the delivery tube 292. Moreover, individual,
 releasable control is provided by employing a delivery wire approach. That is, through
 multiple connections of a plurality of delivery wires to an anchor, desirable control is
 facilitated. Catheter/tube access or over-the-wire access approaches are also contemplated
 for providing in situ access to each anchoring location to deploy both anchor portions and
 tissue penetrating structures.
 [00234]       As shown in FIGS. 50 and 51, the anchor projection 30 can also include a
 leaflet clip configuration 302 attached to its terminal end. The clip 302 can also be
 delivered as described above using a delivery tube and connection delivery wire 294, so
 that it is properly positioned, such as behind a leaflet 109. A flat terminal end 304 of the
 clip 302 presents the valve anatomy with an atraumatic surface, as well as a robust
 engagement.

WO 2013/158613                                                              PCT/US2013/036734
                                             36
 [00235]     In another approach (FIGS. 52-5 3), an anchor implant 310 can include
 commissural projections 312 that extend down and anteriorly to hook under the fibrous
 region of the trigone 60, and beyond the annulus. A penetrating securement element in the
 form of a helical screw 314 (See FIG. 54) can be further deployed through a loop
 presented by the commissural projections 312 to further seat and securely attach the
 anchor implant 310 in place. It is noted that a proximal winding 316 of the helical fastener
 314 can have a larger profile for positioning on an outside wall of local anatomy (such as
 the LV wall). A terminal end 318 of the helical element is sized to retain the structures
 into engagement.
 [00236]     Other approaches to fasteners are also contemplated (FIGS. 55-61). As shown
 in FIGS. 55-56, one device can embody a fastener with a wire brush body 320 and a nail
 head terminal end 322 as retaining structure. Other approaches involving a variable coil
 (FIG. 57), a longitudinally directed coil 324 (FIG. 58) configured parallel to a
 commissural projection, or a curved penetrating ribbon securement markers 326, 328
 (FIGS. 59-60) can also be useful approaches to providing secure retention of parts against
 anatomy. Moreover, a commissural projection 330 (FIG. 61) can be equipped with a cord
 extension through which a penetration securement element 332 can be inserted and
 advanced into body anatomy to accomplish a necessary attachment function.
 [00237] It is intended that approaches to sealing may need to provide a contiguous seal
 between the overall implant (including the implanted replacement valve) and the native
 valve tissue/structures to prevent regurgitant para-valvular flow. Additionally,
 contemplated sealing configurations are intended to provide for tissue engagement and
 stable incorporation at the tissue and sealing structure interface. These sealing structures
 may also provide a staged interface to accommodate alternative type valve implant
 systems, such as the dual parallel valve approaches where the geometry for valve interface
 is not the native annulus or the anchor implant structure. Sealing structures may include a
 frame portion, made of metal or other suitable material in a wire or laser cut configuration.
 The frame may be covered with a material to promote tissue ingrowth. Additionally or
 alternatively, the sealing structure may utilize an expandable member. The expandable
 member can be balloon inflation, a self-expanding metal frame from a compressed
 delivered state, or a self-expanding material such as foam or a hydrogel. The expanding
 member may be used to directly form the seal or it may be used as a deployment

WO 2013/158613                                                             PCT/US2013/036734
                                              37
 mechanism of another structure. Besides using the direct tissue engagement forces
 designed into the structure and or deployment of the valve assembly, the system can
 exploit the pressurization of the LV during systole to create the forces needed to seal
 between the valve assembly and the tissue.
 [00238] As previously noted, the seal may be incorporated into the anchor itself,
 incorporated into the valve, or may be a separate structure. Incorporation of the tissue
 sealing mechanism onto the anchor assembly can either be achieved acutely or utilize the
 chronic ingrowth of the anchor into the tissue to generate a seal allowing for a secondary
 seal between the valve and the anchor during its deployment. The secondary seal can
 utilize the stability and consistency of the anchor structure to complete the overall seal for
 the complete valve assembly.
 [00239] In the situation where the tissue seal is incorporated onto a valve/occluder
 assembly, the anchor structure is primarily utilized to provide the load bearing function
 Where a separate implant structure creates substrate for sealing, the implant engages the
 anchor and valve and the seal is created by one of the following; sealing directly to the
 tissue around the anchor implant creating the primary tissue seal with a secondary seal to
 the valve, sealing to the anchor and the valve as secondary seals with the anchor as the
 primary tissue seal, or structurally bridging the anchor to the valve where the valve creates
 the primary tissue seal.
 [00240] Furthermore, to develop an acute seal between the native tissue and the specific
 element of the overall valve assembly, direct force between the valve assembly and the
 tissue can be used. Alternatively, the pressurization of the LV during ventricular systole
 can be used to "inflate" or pressurize an element on the valve assembly such that it
 engages the native tissue to create a seal.
 [00241] In one approach, for the interface between the anchor and the tissue, simple
 surface contact between the surfaces can facilitate sealing through tissue ingrowth.
 Additionally the anchor skeleton can provide an expansion force to create a compressive
 interface. In certain embodiments of the anchor, dilatory or pinching like forces can be
 created at certain regions of the anchor.
 [00242] Mechanisms to create engagement between the anchor and valve can include
 balloon expansion of valve frame into anchor structure, or self-expansion of valve frame

WO 2013/158613                                                              PCT/US2013/036734
                                              38
 into anchor structures. Additionally, a hook-like engagement where the valve frame
 clasps or hooks onto anchor or anchor and tissue can be used as can a frictional fit between
 the structures, the same being created via balloon or self-expansion of the valve frame into
 the anchor. Interlock mechanisms where the valve frame engages the anchor ring can be
 employed as can conformable balloon or material interface.
 [00243] For a tissue/valve interface, dilation of the valve or valve frame elements can be
 utilized. Also contemplated is a simple surface contact to facilitate ingrowth of tissue onto
 valve structures, compression and expansion elements on the valve frame for directly
 engaging the tissue, inflation of a valve structure via the LV pressure, and then
 deployment of hooks or structural frame elements enhance or create tissue engagement. It
 is further noted that the various sealing structures disclosed can be adapted to either be
 part of the anchor structure, part of the valve structure, or be an independently delivered
 structure. Moreover, all disclosed features can be utilized individually or in any
 combination. Surface composition elements, specifically material choice and texture to
 promote tissue reaction and device incorporation with maximal sealing capability, may
 have a significant impact on sealing capabilities. Specific sealing modifications can
 include surface texture (pores to promote ingrowth and mechanical hold), material choice
 (Dacron velour, double velour, ePTFE), abrasive surfaces, and/or a chemical irritant to
 promote inflammatory response. Further, tissue surface modification can involve abrasive
 chemical irritant to promote inflammatory response, and the use of heat.
 [00244] Accordingly, as shown in FIGS. 62 and 63, an anchor implant 450 can include
 an internal ring 452 surrounded by a covering 454 adapted for tissue ingrowth. As stated,
 tissue ingrowth cooperates with the engagement of the anchor implant 410 to create a seal
 against heart tissue. As before, the anchor implant is sized and shaped to fit the heart
 valve annulus.
 [00245]    Sealing can also be accomplished by employing petals 460 arranged about a
 circumference of an expandable frame 462 (See FIGS. 64-67). As shown in FIG. 67, the
 valve assembly can assume a compressed configuration for delivery and then expanded
 upon implantation. Selected such petals 460 can be arranged to engage a valve annulus or
 alternatively can be configured to engage the leaflets themselves. A foldable fabric 464
 can further be provided about the petals to facilitate sealing and a continuous engagement
 about a perimeter of a valve.

WO 2013/158613                                                              PCT/US2013/036734
                                             39
 [00246]      As shown in FIGS. 68-72, an expandable ventricular ring 470 can also be used
 to accomplish desired sealing. Here, a pair of longitudinally spaced circular frames 472,
 474 support a fabric covering 476. The lower frame 474 expands outwardly to engage
 tissue and provide the sealing function against tissue. It is contemplated that the first
 frame 472 resides above the valve annulus and the second frame 474 engages anatomy
 below the annulus. In this situation, the seal between the native tissue/leaflet with frame
 474 is facilitated by the LV pressurization of the internal surface of the frame 474 and
 fabric 476 as well as the underside of the leaflets pushing the tissue and frame 474 against
 each other.
 [00247]      With reference to FIGS. 73-75, a fluid filled balloon 480 can also be
 incorporated into sealing structure. The balloon 480 can define a ring-shaped structure
 which when expanded engages and seals against varying heart anatomy. The assembly
 can further include commissural engagement anchors 482, the same being defined by a
 wire frame. A downwardly projecting frame 484 can also be included to aid in absorbing
 forces tending rotate the assembly when implanted at the native valve.
 [00248] With reference to FIGS. 76-78, a sealing assembly 490 can also embody an
 anchor ring 492 partially enclosed by a ring balloon 494. The anchor ring 492 engages
 tissue at the valve annulus and the circular balloon 494 forms a "C" about the anchor ring
 492 when viewed in cross-section, thereby presenting two additional contact points with
 anatomy about the perimeter of a valve. Such structure provides a seal between the
 assembly and heart anatomy as well as between the anchor ring 492 and ring balloon 494
 through an interlocking engagement. A circular band 496 placed at the junction between
 the balloon 494 and anchor ring 492 can limit expansion of the balloon 494 and facilitate
 its surrounding the anchor ring 492.
 [00249]      As shown in FIGS. 79-82, a sealing assembly 500 can alternatively embody a
 circular frame 502 including a plurality of vertically arranged, expandable wire struts 504
 spaced about a periphery of the frame 502. Configured between a central frame structure
 506 and the expandable struts 502 is an expandable circular balloon 508. Upon expansion
 of the balloon 508, the expandable struts 504 expand outwardly and thus can engage and
 bend around an anchor implant 509 placed at the interventional site. Such bending forces
 created by the expanded balloon operate to seal the assembly 500 against the anchor 509
 and valve anatomy.

WO 2013/158613                                                            PCT/US2013/036734
                                            40
 [00250]      FIGS. 83 and 84 depict an additional two approaches to sealing structures. In
 each, a frame is contoured with a fabric covering 510. The frame can be formed from a
 wire mesh 512 (FIG. 83) or can be defined by an expandable metal frame 514 (FIG. 84).
 Again, such structure is intended to sealingly engage within heart anatomy and when
 desired, about an anchor implant.
 [00251] Moreover, as shown in FIGS. 85-87, sealing can be created by a flexible
 polyester skirt 520 which expands outwardly in response to pressures within the heart.
 The expandable skirt 520 can be configured about an extremity of a frame of a heart valve
 that is additionally supported by commissural anchors 522 extending to within the LV.
 Over time, tissue over growth covers the skirt 520 providing further attachment and
 sealing.
 [00252] Various approaches to expandable strut structure are also contemplated for use
 as sealing structures (See FIGS. 88-100). In a first approach (FIGS. 88-90), an expandable
 frame 530 can include a plurality of rows of cells, a middle row of cells include members
 which expand outwardly to engage an anchor implant 532 about a periphery of an annulus.
 In another approach (FIGS. 91-93), a sealing frame 540 is embodied in a braided and
 folded wire mesh structure. An internal portion of the fold 542 attaches to a valve
 structure 543, whereas a portion of an outer section 544 of the folded wire mesh engages
 and forms about an anchor implant frame 546. In yet another approach, the sealing frame
 can be defined by folded metal wire forming structure 550 including indented geometry
 552 for engaging an anchor frame 554 and an inner layer which can support valve leaflets
 556 (See FIGS. 94-95). Other expandable frame designs are shown in FIGS. 96-99. One
 such design 560 (FIGS. 96-97) embodies a frame 562 which expands into a tubular shape
 with a mid-level indentation 564 formed by smaller slits and sized to engage an anchor
 implant, and a second design 570 (FIGS. 98-99) expands into a tube with a series of upper
 and lower projections 572 spaced longitudinally providing a space to receive an anchor.
 [00253] In still yet another approach (FIGS. 100-102) a compressible material 580 can be
 employed to create or facilitate sealing. The compressible material can define a ring
 structure about a valve 582 and placed into engagement with an anchor 584. The
 compressible material can be made from a foam or hydrogel and thus act as an
 interlocking element.

WO 2013/158613                                                             PCT/US2013/036734
                                              41
 [00254] Additionally, the sealing device can be embodied in a ring 590 including
 commissural projections 592 including barbs 594 (FIG. 103). Placement of a valve
 assembly with the ring 590 helps maintain the barbs 594 in place. Moreover, a sealing
 ring 600 can conform about and beyond the annulus and between papillary muscles and
 cooperate with projections 602 extending from an anchor to accomplish secure
 implantation (See FIGS. 104-106). Furthermore, as shown in FIGS. 107-108, a sealing
 device 610 can cooperate with a plurality of projections 612 extending from a valve, as
 well as a hooked attachment member 614 that is inserted into tissue as an anchoring
 structure.
 [00255] Various other tubular sealing assemblies are shown in FIGS. 109-115. Turning
 in particular to FIGS. 109-111, a tubular sealing assembly 620 can include an expandable
 tubular frame 622 and a membrane perimeter 624 extending about a midsection thereof.
 Upon expansion of the tubular frame 622, the midsection of the frame 622 opens to the
 profile defined by the membrane 624 to thereby present a sealing interface structure.
 Alternatively, an expandable wire frame 630 can be unconstrained by a membrane and
 extend to match body anatomy (FIG. 112) or it can be a sealing device 640 including a
 compressible material band 642 about its midsection as well as an additional sealing ring
 644 (See FIG. 113) attached to its leading edge.
 [00256] In yet another approach (See FIGS. 114-115), the sealing device 650 can include
 a pair of wire extensions 652 sized and shaped to extend within the LV between papillary
 muscles. A wire 654 with a sheath 656 at is tip can be used during delivery of the sealing
 device 650 to the implantation site. Once placed as desired, the structure can be
 disengaged from the wire extensions 652, permitting them to engage supporting anatomy
 within the LV. In order to provide a surface to capture anterior and posterior leaflets, the
 wire extensions can assume a coiled configuration when deployed.
 [00257] The delivery system and method used to deliver the anchor system can depend
 on both the structure and type of materials used for the anchor, as well as the desired route
 of access for implantation, and the type of deployment of the anchor. An anchor delivery
 system can generally include a guide catheter and an anchor delivery catheter, either as
 separate components, or integrated together. The guide catheter may include specific
 curves to facilitate navigation into the atrium or ventricle and may also include a steerable
 torquable shaft to aid with anchor positioning or orientation. The guide catheter may

WO 2013/158613                                                               PCT/US2013/036734
                                              42
 further include a deflectable tip region. The anchor delivery catheter can house or hold the
 collapsed anchor during delivery and deployment and may include delivery tubes or wires
 that are releasably connected to the anchor. Other elements such as shaft dividers may be
 utilized to help with managing multiple connection shafts as well as orientation of the
 anchor during deployment. Additional components inside the connection shaft or wires, or
 deliverable through or over, may include tissue penetrating elements to aid with overall
 securement and anchoring. A proximal hub can be configured to function to selectively
 manipulate, seal, and deploy certain elements. It is contemplated that structures can be
 incorporated onto the anchor to allow for a percutaneous delivery and include the use of
 super elastic Nitinol for the primary skeleton of the anchor or the use of a malleable SST
 or a similar material that could be folded down inside the delivery catheter but then
 balloon expanded against the tissue interface and would conform mitral tissue interface.
 The use of heat set small radii in certain locations of the anchor structure can allow for
 folding to fit inside delivery catheter where the strain limit of the material is not exceeded.
 Also, the use of ribbon at certain locations within the anchor skeletal structure can allow
 for tight bends in the thinner dimension for bending inside catheter, but still achieve the
 structural rigidity required if the broader section of ribbon is properly oriented when
 deployed. Smaller and larger diameter wire can also be used to vary the configuration to
 allow for bending/collapse in the catheter while still having the necessary structural
 strength and interface when deployed.
 [00258] It is further contemplated that the anchor structures allow for arterial
 (aorta-retrograde), venous (via transatrial septum - antegrade), trans-apical (LV), or
 trans-atrial via a right thoracotomy access into the left atrium. Because of the relatively
 small size of the anchor, the ability to compress or fold the anchor into a small delivery
 configuration (especially with Nitinol or malleable stainless), and the separation of the
 anchor from the valve, the arterial route is feasible and may be especially useful in the
 situation where the anchor is deployed at the time of a diagnostic angiogram that is in
 advance of the actual valve therapy (separate procedures), as the arterial groin access has
 already been created. Routes of access can include arterial, venous and/or thorax/apical.
 [00259] To deploy the anchor into the heart, both catheter sheath retraction and anchor
 push out of sheath are contemplated approaches. Also, to have the anchor achieve the

WO 2013/158613                                                               PCT/US2013/036734
                                             43
 desired configuration inside the heart, either a self-expanding anchor, or use of balloon
 expansion to expand the anchor, or components of both are contemplated.
 [00260] For anchors that are supra-annular with commissural feet, delivery system
 connections to the tips of the commissural feet or projections can facilitate positioning and
 proper orientation and seating into the mitral orifice. In this regard, the anchor and
 connections would exit the delivery catheter while the catheter tip was residing in the left
 atrium. The delivery sheath could then be pulled down beneath the level of the mitral
 annulus allowing the shaft connections to the feet to orient and align with the commissural
 clefts of the anterior annulus between the anterior and posterior native leaflets. As the
 shaft connections are pulled, the commissural feet would move toward the edge and bring
 the feet into position next to the LV wall within the natural leaflet cleft. Once in this
 position, additional features of the implants could be deployed or delivered via the shaft
 connections used to aid in attaching the feet to the wall/leaflet tissue, e.g. staple, barbed
 hooks or nails. Similar feet could be utilized for orientation along the clefts seen naturally
 on the P1 and P3 regions of the posterior leaflet.
 [00261] According to one aspect, an exemplary embodiment of the delivery system
 utilizes an outer delivery or guide catheter that has a pre-formed curve that positions the
 anchor delivery catheter into the proper orientation toward the mitral valve from the LV.
 For retrograde access to the LV from the aorta, curves ranging from 90 to 200 degrees
 may be used. A pre-formed shaft separator or a shaft separator with prespecified bending
 moments within the guide catheter can also aid in orienting and positioning the anchor and
 associated connection shafts.
 [00262] According to another aspect, an exemplary embodiment of a delivery system
 may include connection shafts to connect to and control movement of the commissural
 feet of the anchor being deployed. The connection shafts can be tubular or wire structures
 or combinations that can release ably disengage from the anchor after positioning. These
 connection shafts can allow for independent manipulation of the anchor at each individual
 point of attachment.
 [00263] The anchor securement elements can be deployed utilizing the two basic
 structures of the shaft connections to the anchor frame and/or projections, namely the
 tubular shaft and the wire connections providing the temporary securement. The tubular

WO 2013/158613                                                              PCT/US2013/036734
                                              44
 shaft can be retracted to deploy an expanding frame element housed inside the shaft during
 frame delivery. Also, the tubular shaft can be used as a conduit to deliver a separate
 structure to the attachment location and/or to expose or deploy a securement element and
 then used to either actuate or drive the element by re-advancing the tube. Further, a wire
 element can be used as a conduit or rail to deliver a separate structure to the attachment
 location. The wire element can also be used to deploy or push out an element
 loaded/housed inside the tube/wire structure and/or the wire structure can be used by
 rotating an element connected at its tip to deliver the securement element.
 [00264] With reference to FIGS. 116-127, one delivery system and method is presented.
 In a first step (FIG. 116), a j-tip guidewire 700 is advanced within the heart through the
 aortic valve AV. Conventional methods including those outlined above are employed to
 gain access to the aorta. Next, an intraventricular guide catheter 702 is advanced over or
 along the guidewire 700 (FIG. 117). The distal tip 704 of the guide catheter 702 is
 oriented toward the mitral valve MV, with a curve plane of the catheter being parallel to
 the A2/P2 orientation. The guidewire 700 (or a second guidewire) is then advanced
 through the orifice of the mitral valve MV, thereby providing a platform for placing
 structure across the mitral valve MV (See FIGS. 118-119).
 [00265] With the guidewire 700 across to the mitral valve MV, a balloon or expandable
 cage 710 is configured within the orifice of the mitral valve MV (See FIGS. 120-12 1). It
 is to be recognized that the guidewire 700 can be equipped with the balloon or expandable
 cage 710, or a separate device can be advanced over the guidewire 700, and the balloon or
 cage 710 placed within the orifice of the mitral valve MV. In one embodiment, structure
 is provided to withdraw a distal portion of the balloon or cage 710 relative to proximal
 structure to thereby expand the balloon or cage 710, or a sleeve structure can be advanced
 relative to a distal portion of the balloon or cage to accomplish the expansion. It is also
 contemplated that the balloon or cage 710 be expanded in the left atrium LA and then
 withdrawn within the orifice of the mitral valve 710 to ensure there is no entanglement
 with cords 712 supporting the mitral valve with any portion or components of the delivery
 system. The balloon or cage 710 is then contracted and removed from within the orifice of
 the mitral valve MV, or otherwise covered with other structure of the delivery system.
 [00266] If the wire cage meets a restriction, the cage can be collapsed and it and wire can
 be withdrawn back into guide and non-entangled wire access attempted again.

WO 2013/158613                                                             PCT/US2013/036734
                                             45
 Alternatively, the expanded wire cage could be advanced first until it passes mitral orifice
 without restriction. The size of the cage is large enough to fit through orifice but not
 between chordae attached to the same papillary muscle, and traverses between chordal tent
 and anterior and posterior leaflets. The wire is then advanced into atria to provide anchor
 system delivery that does not entangle with subvalvular mitral apparatus. Alternatively, a
 balloon tipped catheter can be utilized instead of a cage. Once the wire is successfully
 placed, the wire cage or balloon system is removed from body leaving wire access for the
 next steps of anchor delivery.
 [00267] As shown in FIGS. 122 and 123, an anchor delivery catheter 720 is next
 advanced over the guidewire 700 and within the guide catheter 702. A length of the
 anchor delivery catheter 720 is placed across the orifice of the mitral valve MV.
 Subsequently (See FIGS. 124 and 125), the anchor implant 730 is advanced out of a
 terminal end of the anchor delivery catheter 720 and into the left atrium LA. Proper
 orientation of the anchor implant 730 is provided by a plurality of connection wires 740.
 Such wires 740 are each connected to a single commissural projection 744 of the anchor
 implant 740, so that one commissural projection 744 is aligned with each trigone T, and
 one commissural 744 is aligned with the posterior leaflet segment P2. Connection
 between wires 740 and commissural projection 744 is maintained until proper positioning
 is ensured, and so that reorientation and retrieval is possible.
 [00268]    Once the positioning of the anchor implant 740 is verified, the anchor delivery
 catheter 720 and connection wires 742 are withdrawn to place the anchor implant 740
 within the annulus of the mitral valve MV. When placed as desired, a commissural
 projection 744 is placed at each the trigone T, and one at P2 (See FIGS. 126-127). As can
 be best appreciated from FIG. 125, a shaft 750 having three or more longitudinal bores
 formed therein can be employed to push the anchor implant 720 out from an interior of the
 anchor delivery catheter 720. The longitudinal bores provide conduits for the connection
 wires 742 used to orient the anchor implant 730. A central longitudinal bore (not shown)
 can be further provided to receive the guidewire 700; however, in the event the shaft 750
 does not include a central bore, the guidewire 700 is removed from the interventional site
 prior to the advancement of the anchor delivery catheter 720 within the guide catheter 702.
 [00269] In an alternative approach to the anchor delivery catheter (See FIGS. 128-132
 shown without an anchor), a longitudinal shaft separator 760 can be employed in place of

WO 2013/158613                                                               PCT/US2013/036734
                                              46
 the above-described shaft. Thus, rather than have a plurality of longitudinal bores sized to
 receive the connection wires 742, the shaft separator 760 includes a plurality of splines
 762 extending from a central core to define spaces for the connection wires 747. A
 central bore 764 is further provided to slidingly receive the guidewire 700. As shown in
 FIGS. 128 and 129, the splines 762 can be placed at varying locations to facilitate proper
 orientation of structure within the anchor delivery catheter 720 such as by auto-orienting
 connection wires to a plane of the oriented guide catheter. For example, one spline 766
 can be sized and positioned to orient along an inner radius 768 of a curve of the delivery
 system (See FIG. 132). The curve of the shaft separator 760 aligns and maintains
 rotational orientation of the separator splines relative to the curve of the anchor delivery
 catheter 720 or the guide catheter 768.
 [00270] Moreover, with reference to FIGS. 133-135, various alternatives are presented
 regarding releasable connections between commissural projections and structure of the
 anchor delivery system 720. In one approach (See FIGS. 133-134), a commissural
 projection 770 of an anchor implant can include a deployable staple 772. The deployable
 staple 772 is configured within the anchor delivery catheter or a separate sheath 774 of the
 anchor delivery system. A positioning rod 776 with a threaded terminal end is joined to
 internal threads formed within the deployable staple 772 to define a threaded connection
 778 between the parts. Further, a retainer cord 780 is placed through the sheath 774, the
 same including a loop 782 configured about the positioning rod 776 and a terminal end
 784 engaging the commissural projection 770. In this way, distinct point controls are
 provided to separately position and deploy the staple 772 and the commissural projection
 770. That is, the retainer cord 780 can be withdrawn from engagement with the
 commissural projection 700 to facilitate its implantation separately from deploying the
 staple by rotating the position rod 770 from engagement with the staple 771.
 [00271] In an alternative approach (See FIG. 135), a threaded connection 790 can be
 provided between a threaded receiver 792 formed on the anchor itself, and a threaded
 connection wire 794. Here, a delivery connector tube 796 includes a first large bore 797
 sized to receive the commissural projection 798, and a second smaller bore sized to
 slidingly receive the connector wire 794. Again, distinct point control is provided in that
 the commissural projection 798 can be released independently of disengagement of the
 threaded connection 790.

WO 2013/158613                                                               PCT/US2013/036734
                                               47
 [00272]     Percutaneous, or minimally invasive trans-apical, valve delivery systems
 typically can be over the wire systems with the valve assembly compressed or crimped
 into the delivery state. To expose the valve, the outer catheter structure or sheath can either
 be withdrawn or the implant pushed or expelled from the outer catheter. The tip of the
 valve delivery system can also include a tapered and flexible tip section to facilitate
 navigation and tracking of the system within the vasculature or heart. Once exposed the
 valve is either self-expanding or balloon expanding. Some releasable connection shafts or
 wires to the valve frame may also be incorporated to facilitate positioning and orientation.
 [00273]     Various loading methods and structures are contemplated. Tools such as
 crimping devices can be utilized for compressing the valve down onto the delivery
 catheter shaft and into a deliverable configuration and size. Moreover, a primary route of
 access for a replacement mitral valve can be via a venous trans-septal antegrade approach.
 It is also anticipated a transapical approach can be utilized. A trans-atrial approach via a
 right thoracotomy to gain access to the left atrium can also be used and may be useful
 when utilizing a mechanical valve for implantation. Thus, routes of access can include
 arterial, venous and/or thorax/apical.
 [00274]     Various deployment methods are also contemplated. The deployment of the
 valve can utilize any of the current techniques being employed for percutaneous pulmonic
 or aortic implantation. This includes retraction of a sheath or advancement of the valve
 inside the sheath to have the valve exit the delivery catheter. Once exited, either partially
 or completely, the final valve deployment could include self-expansion or balloon
 expansion. With either of these final deployment techniques, a nondeployed interlock
 structure/mechanism on the perimeter of the artificial valve could provide a temporary
 space for flow communication of the atria with the ventricle during diastole during
 artificial valve expansion. Upon completion of artificial valve expansion, it would now be
 functional and the interlock mechanism could now be deployed to complete the anchoring
 and sealing of the artificial valve. This particular embodiment can eliminate the
 conventional need for rapid pacing during valve deployment; there is flow allowed during
 diastole while valve is deployed. Therefore, each of retraction, push, self-expanding, and
 balloon approaches are contemplated.
 [00275]     With respect to orientation/positioning methods, utilizing a separately implanted
 anchor substrate is the ability to utilize a fluoroscopic alignment technique to mesh the

WO 2013/158613                                                               PCT/US2013/036734
                                              48
 anchor with the valve. In this scenario, the x-ray fluoroscopic camera could be adjusted so
 a radiopaque (complete or interrupted around perimeter) anchor structure would be
 visualized in a relatively straight line (camera orientation - line connecting emitter with
 intensifier- is perpendicular to anchor circular axis, or parallel to plane of anchor ring).
 The valve frame structure could similarly have a radiopaque perimeter at the point at or
 near the interlock region with the anchor. When the anchor was viewed in the manner
 described, the valve axial orientation could be adjusted so the radiopaque perimeter was
 also a line (without moving camera position) meaning the two cylindrical axes of the
 anchor and valve were now parallel. Subsequently, the valve line could be appropriately
 positioned above, below, or at the interlock region. This linear alignment of the two
 radiopaque structures would be even more visually pronounced as the valve frame was
 being expanded/deployed, whether by balloon or self-expanding. This could additionally
 allow for fine tuning or adjustment prior to final engagement of the valve with the anchor
 structure.
 [00276] With references to FIGS. 136-142, various steps to placement of an artificial
 mitral valve are presented. FIG. 136 shows the anchor delivery system 800 placed within
 the heart subsequent to implantation of an anchor implant 802. In one approach, the
 anchor implant 802 is left to heal in place prior to deployment of the artificial valve.
 Alternatively, as stated above, valve implantation can be conducted along with or just
 subsequent to the placement of the anchor implant 802. Using a transarterial approach, as
 shown in FIGS. 137-138, an artificial valve delivery system 810 is advanced in a
 transvenous, trans-septal approach to position an artificial valve 820 into engagement with
 the anchor implant 802. In order to properly orient the anchor implant 802 and valve 810
 relative to each other, each of the anchor implant and valve can include radiopaque
 markers. Anchor radiopaque markers 822 and valve radiopaque markers 824 can thus be
 aligned both longitudinally or axially (See FIGS. 139-140) as well as rotationally (See
 FIGS. 141-142). In this context, a fluoroscopic camera (not shown) can be employed to
 guide the relatively positional relationship between anchor 822 and valve 824 markers. It
 is to be further noted that radiopaque markers residing on a commissural projection of an
 anchor implant can further be used to ensure that they are seated as desired between
 commissures, and markers located on a ring portion of an implant can be used to locate
 such structure at a valve annulus.

WO 2013/158613                                                              PCT/US2013/036734
                                              49
 [00277] Turning now to FIGS. 143-146 and FIGS. 147-150, an alternative trans-atrial
 approach and a trans-apical approach to artificial valve delivery are depicted. Here, a
 valve delivery system includes an introducer tool 828 which is insertable through a portal
 assembly 830. The portal assembly 830 has a generally flat, oval cross-sectional profile
 intended to present a less invasive structure to heart tissue. The introducer tool 828 further
 includes an articulating terminal end portion 832 adapted to releasably hold an artificial
 valve 834. The terminal end portion 832 is configured to retain a tilted valve 834 (See
 FIGS. 143-144 and 147-148) for insertion into an interior of the heart through the portal
 assembly 830, and is articulatable so that the artificial heart valve 834 can be turned and
 placed into engagement with an anchor implant 840 previously delivered at the native
 valve (See FIGS. 145-146 and 149-150). Notably, the portal assembly 830 further
 includes purse string sutures 842 configured about an exterior surface of a portion of the
 assembly located at the point of heart insertion. Upon removing the portal assembly 830
 from the interventional site, the purse strings are intended to remain in place on the heart
 and are thus available to close the access point employed for the valve insertion. In this
 way, the implantation procedure is completed expeditiously with a repaired access point.
