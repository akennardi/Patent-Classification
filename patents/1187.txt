[0001]      This patent application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application
No. 61/771,25 1, filed March 1, 2013 and Australian patent application 2013379773 filed
April 30 2013, which are incorporated by reference in their entirety herein.
[0001a]    This invention was made with Government             support under project number

                           BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
[0002]      Adoptive cell therapy (ACT) using tumor reactive T cells can produce positive
clinical responses in some cancer patients. Nevertheless, several obstacles to the successful
use of ACT for the treatment of cancer and other diseases remain. For example, T cells
isolated from peripheral blood may not exhibit sufficient tumor-specific reactivity.
Accordingly, there is a need for improved methods of obtaining a population of tumor
reactive T cells from peripheral blood.

                      DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
[0011]      It has been discovered that selecting CD8* cells that also express programmed cell
death protein 1 (PD-1; CD279) and/or T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain 3 (TIM-3)
biomarkers enriches for tumor-reactive T cells present in peripheral blood. Selecting the
CD8* cells that also express PD-I and/or TIM-3 advantageously enriches for greater numbers
of tumor-reactive T cells as compared to CD8' cells that do not express these markers.
[0012]      In this regard, an embodiment of the invention provides a method of obtaining a
cell population enriched for tumor-reactive T cells, the method comprising: (a) obtaining a
bulk population of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from a sample of peripheral
blood; (b) specifically selecting CD8* T cells that also express PD-I and/or TIM-3 from the
bulk population; and (c) separating the cells selected in (b) from unselected cells to obtain a
cell population enriched for tumor-reactive T cells. The inventive methods advantageously
make it possible to shorten the time of in vitro culture and to select for tumor-reactive T cells
without having to screen for autologous tumor recognition.
[0013]      The method may comprise obtaining a bulk population of PBMCs from a sample
of peripheral blood by any suitable method known in the art. Suitable methods of obtaining a
bulk population of PBMCs may include, but are not limited to, a blood draw and/or a
leukapheresis. The bulk population of PBMCs obtained from a tumor sample may comprise
T cells, including tumor-reactive T cells.
[0014]      The peripheral blood may be obtained from any mammal. Unless stated
otherwise, as used herein, the term "mammal" refers to any mammal including, but not

                                                 4
limited to, mammals of the order Logomorpha, such as rabbits; the order Carnivora, including
Felines (cats) and Canines (dogs); the order Artiodactyla, including Bovines (cows) and
Swines (pigs); or of the order Perssodactyla, including Equines (horses). It is preferred that
the mammals are non-human primates, e.g., of the order Primates, Ceboids, or Simoids
(monkeys) or of the order Anthropoids (humans and apes). In some embodiments, the
mammal may be a mammal of the order Rodentia, such as mice and hamsters. Preferably,
the mammal is a non-human primate or a human. An especially preferred mammal is the
human.
[0015]      The method may comprise specifically selecting CD8* T cells that also express
PD- 1 and/or TIM-3 from the bulk population. In a preferred embodiment, the method
comprises selecting cells that also express CD3. The method may comprise specifically
selecting the cells in any suitable manner. Preferably, the selecting is carried out using flow
cytometry. The flow cytometry may be carried out using any suitable method known in the
art. The flow cytometry may employ any suitable antibodies and stains. For example, the
specific selection of CD3, CD8, TIM-3, or PD-1 may be carried out using anti-CD3, anti
CD8, anti-TIM-3, or anti-PD-i antibodies, respectively. Preferably, the antibody is chosen
such that it specifically recognizes and binds to the particular biomarker being selected. The
antibody or antibodies may be conjugated to a bead (e.g., a magnetic bead) or to a
fluorochrome. Preferably, the flow cytometry is fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS).
[0016]      In an embodiment of the invention, specifically selecting may comprise
specifically selecting CD8* T cells that are positive for expression of any one of TIM-3, PD
1, or both TIM-3 and PD-1. In this regard, specifically selecting may comprise specifically
selecting T cells that are single positive for expression of TIM-3 or PD-I or double positive
for simultaneous co-expression of TIM-3 and PD-1. In an embodiment of the invention, the
method comprises specifically selecting CD8* T cells that express TIM-3 from the bulk
population. In still another embodiment of the invention, the method comprises specifically
selecting CD8* T cells that express PD-i from the bulk population. Still another embodiment
of the invention comprises specifically selecting CD8* T cells that are (i) TIM-3*/PD-l*, (ii)
TIM-3-/PD-1*, or (iii) TIM-3*/PD-1- from the bulk population. In another embodiment of the
invention, any of the methods described herein may further comprise selecting cells that also
express CD3*.

                                                 5
[0017]       In an embodiment of the invention, specifically selecting may comprise
specifically selecting combinations of CD8* cells expressing any of the markers described
herein. In this regard, the method may produce a cell population that is enriched for tumor
reactive cells that comprises a mixture of cells expressing any two of the biomarkers
described herein. In an embodiment of the invention, specifically selecting comprises
specifically selecting a combination of PD-l cells and TIM-3* cells. In another embodiment
of the invention, any of the methods described herein may further comprise selecting cells
that also express CD8* and/or CD3*.
[0018]       The method may comprise separating the selected cells from unselected cells to
obtain a cell population enriched for tumor-reactive T cells. In this regard, the selected cells
may be physically separated from the unselected cells. The selected cells may be separated
from unselected cells by any suitable method such as, for example, sorting. Separating the
selected cells from the unselected cells preferably produces a cell population that is enriched
for tumor-reactive T cells.
[0019]       The cell populations obtained by the inventive methods are advantageously
enriched for tumor-reactive T cells. In this regard, the cell populations obtained by the
inventive methods may comprise a higher proportion of tumor reactive T cells as compared to
cell populations that have not been obtained by sorting for expression of TIM-3 and/or PD-1.
[0020]       In an embodiment of the invention, the method comprises obtaining the cell
population enriched for tumor-reactive T cells without screening for autologous tumor
recognition. In this regard, the inventive methods advantageously provide a cell population
that is enriched for cells that have tumor reactivity without having to screen the cells for
autologous tumor recognition.
[0021]       In an embodiment of the invention, the method does not comprise non-specifically
stimulating the bulk population of T cells prior to specifically selecting the cells. In this
regard, the inventive methods advantageously provide a cell population that is enriched for
tumor reactive T cells without stimulating the bulk population of T cells nonspecifically (e.g.,
with anti-4-1BB antibodies, anti-CD3 antibodies, and/or anti-CD28 antibodies).
[0022]       In an embodiment of the invention, the method further comprises expanding the
numbers of T cells in the enriched cell population obtained by the inventive methods in vitro.
The numbers of T cells may be increased at least about 3-fold (or 4-, 5-, 6-, 7-, 8-, or 9-fold),

                                                 6
more preferably at least about 10-fold (or 20-, 30-, 40-, 50-, 60-, 70-, 80-, or 90-fold), more
preferably at least about 100-fold, more preferably at least about 1,000 fold, or most
preferably at least about 100,000-fold. The numbers of T cells may be expanded using any
suitable method known in the art. Exemplary methods of expanding the numbers of cells are
described in U.S. Patent 8,034,334 and U.S. Patent Application Publication No.
2012/0244133, each of which is incorporated herein by reference.
[0023]      In an embodiment of the invention, the method further comprises culturing the
enriched cell population obtained by the inventive methods in the presence of any one or
more of TWS 119, interleukin (IL-21), IL-12, IL-15, IL-7, transforming growth factor (TGF)
beta, and AKT inhibitor (AKTi). Without being bound to a particular theory, it is believed
that culturing the enriched cell population in the presence of TWS 119, IL-2 1, and/or IL- 12
may, advantageously, enhance the anti-tumor reactivity of the enriched cell population by
preventing or retarding the differentiation of the enriched cell population.
[0024]      In an embodiment of the invention, the method further comprises transducing or
transfecting the cells of the enriched population obtained by any of the inventive methods
described herein with a nucleotide sequence encoding any one or more of IL-12, IL-7, IL-15,
IL-2, IL-21, mirl55, and anti-PD-1 siRNA.
[0025]      In an embodiment of the invention, the method further comprises stimulating the
enriched cell population obtained by the inventive methods with a cancer antigen and/or with
autologous tumor cells. Stimulating the enriched cell population with a cancer antigen and/or
with autologous tumor cells may be carried out by any suitable method. For example,
stimulating the enriched cell population may be carried out by physically contacting the
enriched cell population with a cancer antigen and/or with autologous tumor cells. Without
being bound to a particular theory, it is believed that stimulating the enriched cell population
with a cancer antigen and/or with autologous tumor cells may, advantageously, enhance the
anti-tumor reactivity of the enriched cell population.
[0026]      The term "cancer antigen" as used herein refers to any molecule (e.g., protein,
peptide, lipid, carbohydrate, etc.) solely or predominantly expressed or over-expressed by a
tumor cell or cancer cell, such that the antigen is associated with the tumor or cancer. The
cancer antigen can additionally be expressed by normal, non-tumor, or non-cancerous cells.
However, in such cases, the expression of the cancer antigen by normal, non-tumor, or non-

                                                7
cancerous cells is not as robust as the expression by tumor or cancer cells. In this regard, the
tumor or cancer cells can over-express the antigen or express the antigen at a significantly
higher level, as compared to the expression of the antigen by normal, non-tumor, or non
cancerous cells. Also, the cancer antigen can additionally be expressed by cells of a different
state of development or maturation. For instance, the cancer antigen can be additionally
expressed by cells of the embryonic or fetal stage, which cells are not normally found in an
adult host. Alternatively, the cancer antigen can be additionally expressed by stem cells or
precursor cells, which cells are not normally found in an adult host.
[0027]      The cancer antigen can be an antigen expressed by any cell of any cancer or
tumor, including the cancers and tumors described herein. The cancer antigen may be a
cancer antigen of only one type of cancer or tumor, such that the cancer antigen is associated
with or characteristic of only one type of cancer or tumor. Alternatively, the cancer antigen
may be a cancer antigen (e.g., may be characteristic) of more than one type of cancer or
tumor. For example, the cancer antigen may be expressed by both breast and prostate cancer
cells and not expressed at all by normal, non-tumor, or non-cancer cells. Exemplary cancer
antigens may include any one or more of gp100, MART-1, MAGE-A1, MAGE-A2, MAGE
A3, MAGE-A4, MAGE-A5, MAGE-A6, MAGE-A7, MAGE-A8, MAGE-A9, MAGE-A10,
MAGE-Al l, MAGE-A12, NY-ESO-1, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2
(VEGFR-2), HER-2, mesothelin, and epidermal growth factor receptor variant III (EGFR
 III).
[0028]      The inventive methods advantageously produce cell populations enriched for
tumor-reactive T cells. The T cells may be tumor-reactive such that they specifically
recognize, lyse, and/or and kill tumor cells. In this regard, an embodiment of the invention
provides an isolated or purified cell population enriched for tumor-reactive T cells obtained
by any of the inventive methods described herein. In an embodiment, the isolated or purified
cell population comprises (a) CD8*/TIM-3*/PD-1* T cells, (b) CD8*/TIM-3-/PD-1* T cells,
and (c) CD8*/TIM-3*/PD-1- T cells, wherein the cell population is enriched for tumor
reactive T cells. In another embodiment of the invention, the isolated or purified cell
population comprises (a) CD8*/TIM-3*/PD-1* T cells, (b) CD8*/TIM-3-/PD-1* T cells, or (c)
CD8*/TIM-3*/PD-1- T cells. In another embodiment of the invention, any of the cell
populations described herein may also be CD3*.

                                                8
[0029]      In an embodiment of the invention, the isolated or purified cell population
comprises a mixture of cells expressing any of the biomarkers described herein. For
example, the isolated or purified cell population may comprise a combination of PD-lI cells
and TIM-3* cells. In another embodiment of the invention, any of the cell populations
described herein may also be CD8* and/or CD3*.
[0030]      The term "isolated" as used herein means having been removed from its natural
environment. The term "purified" as used herein means having been increased in purity,
wherein "purity" is a relative term, and not to be necessarily construed as absolute purity. For
example, the purity can be at least about 50%, can be greater than 60%, 70% or 80%, 90% or
can be 100%.
[0031]      Another embodiment of the invention provides a method of administering a cell
population enriched for tumor-reactive T cells to a mammal, the method comprising: (a)
obtaining a bulk population of PBMCs from a sample of peripheral blood; (b) specifically
selecting CD8* T cells that also express PD-1 and/or TIM-3 from the bulk population; (c)
separating the cells selected in (b) from unselected cells to obtain a cell population enriched
for tumor-reactive T cells; and (d) administering the cell population enriched for tumor
reactive T cells to the mammal. Obtaining a bulk population of PBMCs from a sample of
peripheral blood, specifically selecting CD8* T cells that also express PD-i and/or TIM-3
from the bulk population, and separating the selected cells from unselected cells to obtain a
cell population enriched for tumor-reactive T cells may be carried out as described herein
with respect to other aspects of the invention.
[0032]      The method may further comprise administering the cell population enriched for
tumor-reactive T cells to the mammal. The cell population enriched for tumor-reactive T
cells may be administered in any suitable manner. Preferably, the cell population enriched
for tumor-reactive T cells is administered by injection, e.g., intravenously.
[00331      The inventive cell population enriched for tumor-reactive T cells can be included
in a composition, such as a pharmaceutical composition. In this regard, the invention
provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising any of the cell populations described
herein and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.
[0034]      Another embodiment of the invention provides a method of obtaining a
pharmaceutical composition comprising a cell population enriched for tumor-reactive T cells,

                                                 9
the method comprising: (a) obtaining a bulk population of PBMCs from a sample of
peripheral blood; (b) specifically selecting CD8* T cells that also express PD-i and/or TIM-3
from the bulk population; (c) separating the cells selected in (b) from unselected cells to
obtain a cell population enriched for tumor-reactive T cells; and (d) combining the cell
population enriched for tumor-reactive T cells with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier to
obtain a pharmaceutical composition comprising a cell population enriched for tumor
reactive T cells. Obtaining a bulk population of PBMCs from a sample of peripheral blood,
specifically selecting CD8 T cells that also express PD-I and/or TIM-3 from the bulk
population, and separating the selected cells from unselected cells to obtain a cell population
enriched for tumor-reactive T cells may be carried out as described herein with respect to
other aspects of the invention.
[0035]       The method may comprise combining the cell population enriched for tumor
reactive T cells with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier to obtain a pharmaceutical
composition comprising a cell population enriched for tumor-reactive T cells. Preferably, the
carrier is a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. With respect to pharmaceutical
compositions, the carrier can be any of those conventionally used for the administration of
cells. Such pharmaceutically acceptable carriers are well-known to those skilled in the art
and are readily available to the public. It is preferred that the pharmaceutically acceptable
carrier be one which has no detrimental side effects or toxicity under the conditions of use. A
suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carrier for the cells for injection may include any
isotonic carrier such as, for example, normal saline (about 0.90% w/v of NaCl in water, about
300 mOsm/L NaCl in water, or about 9.0 g NaCl per liter of water), NORMOSOL R
electrolyte solution (Abbott, Chicago, IL), PLASMA-LYTE A (Baxter, Deerfield, IL), about
5% dextrose in water, or Ringer's lactate. In an embodiment, the pharmaceutically acceptable
carrier is supplemented with human serum albumen.
[00361       For purposes of the invention, the dose, e.g., number of cells in the inventive cell
population enriched for tumor-reactive T cells, administered should be sufficient to effect,
e.g., a therapeutic or prophylactic response, in the mammal over a reasonable time frame.
For example, the number of cells should be sufficient to bind to a cancer antigen, or detect,
treat or prevent cancer in a period of from about 2 hours or longer, e.g., 12 to 24 or more
hours, from the time of administration. In certain embodiments, the time period could be

                                                 10
even longer. The number of cells will be determined by, e.g., the efficacy of the particular
cells and the condition of the mammal (e.g., human), as well as the body weight of the
mammal (e.g., human) to be treated.
[0037]      Many assays for determining an administered number of cells from the inventive
cell population enriched for tumor-reactive T cells are known in the art. For purposes of the
invention, an assay, which comprises comparing the extent to which target cells are lysed or
one or more cytokines such as, e.g., IFN-7 and IL-2 are secreted upon administration of a
given number of such cells to a mammal, among a set of mammals of which is each given a
different number of the cells, could be used to determine a starting number to be administered
to a mammal. The extent to which target cells are lysed, or cytokines such as, e.g., IFN-7 and
IL-2 are secreted, upon administration of a certain number of cells, can be assayed by
methods known in the art. Secretion of cytokines such as, e.g., IL-2, may also provide an
indication of the quality (e.g., phenotype and/or effectiveness) of a cell preparation.
[00381      The number of the cells from the inventive cell population enriched for tumor
reactive T cells also will be determined by the existence, nature and extent of any adverse
side effects that might accompany the administration of a particular cell population.
Typically, the attending physician will decide the number of the cells with which to treat each
individual patient, taking into consideration a variety of factors, such as age, body weight,
general health, diet, sex, route of administration, and the severity of the condition being
treated. By way of example and not intending to limit the invention, the number of cells can
be about1O x 106 to about 10 x 10" cells per infusion, about 10 x 10' cells to about 10 x 10"
cells per infusion, or 10 x 10' to about 10 x 109 cells per infusion. The cell populations
obtained by the inventive methods may, advantageously, make it possible to effectively treat
or prevent cancer.
[0039]      It is contemplated that the cell populations obtained by the inventive methods can
be used in methods of treating or preventing cancer. In this regard, the invention provides a
method of treating or preventing cancer in a mammal, comprising administering to the
mammal the pharmaceutical compositions or cell populations obtained by any of the
inventive methods described herein in an amount effective to treat or prevent cancer in the
mammal. Another embodiment of the invention provides a method of treating or preventing
cancer in a mammal, comprising administering a cell population enriched for tumor-reactive

                                                 11
T cells to a mammal by any of the inventive methods described herein in an amount effective
to treat or prevent cancer in the mammal.
 [0040]      The terms "treat," and "prevent" as well as words stemming therefrom, as used
herein, do not necessarily imply 100% or complete treatment or prevention. Rather, there are
varying degrees of treatment or prevention of which one of ordinary skill in the art recognizes
as having a potential benefit or therapeutic effect. In this respect, the inventive methods can
provide any amount or any level of treatment or prevention of cancer in a mammal.
Furthermore, the treatment or prevention provided by the inventive method can include
treatment or prevention of one or more conditions or symptoms of the disease, e.g., cancer,
being treated or prevented. Also, for purposes herein, "prevention" can encompass delaying
the onset of the disease, or a symptom or condition thereof.
 [0041]      For purposes of the inventive methods, wherein populations of cells are
administered, the cells can be cells that are allogeneic or autologous to the mammal.
Preferably, the cells are autologous to the mammal.
 [00421      An embodiment of the invention further comprises lymphodepleting the mammal

[0044]       The following examples further illustrate the invention but, of course, should not
be construed as in any way limiting its scope.
                                          EXAMPLE 1
[00451       This example demonstrates the in vitro autologous tumor recognition of T cells
isolated from the peripheral blood of melanoma patients according to expression of PD-1,
TIM-3, or LAG-3 after expanding the numbers of cells in vitro.
[00461       4-1BB up-regulation is an indicator of TCR stimulation. It has been observed that
after the numbers of cells are expanded and in the absence of TCR stimulation, 4-1BB
expression is lost. It has also been observed that after the numbers of cells are expanded and
the cells are co-cultured with the autologous tumor cell line, T cells that had previously lost
4-1BB expression and which are stimulated by the cell line will re-express 4-1B.
Accordingly, 4-1BB expression is measured 24 hours after co-culture with autologous tumor
as a marker of TCR stimulation against the autologous tumor cell line.
[0047]       Cells obtained from the peripheral blood of each of three melanoma patients
(1913, 3713, and 3289) by apheresis were rested over night without cytokines and stained.
The cells from patients 1913 and 3713 were sorted into the following CD3* populations using
anti-CD3, anti-CD8, anti-PD-1, and TIM-3 antibodies: CD8*, CD8*/PD-l,           CD8/TIM-3*,
CD8*/PD-1-, or CD8/TIM-3- by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). The cells from
patient 3289 were sorted into the following CD3* populations using anti-CD3, anti-CD8,
anti-PD-1, TIM-3, and LAG-3 antibodies: CD8*, CD8*/PD-1', CD8*/LAG3*, CD8/TIM-3*,
CD8*/PD-1-, CD8*/LAG3-, or CD8*/TIM-3- by FACS. The numbers of cells were expanded
in vitro for 14 days. On day 14, cells were washed and co-cultured with the corresponding
autologous tumor cell lines (I x 10' effectors: I x 105 target cells) and reactivity was assessed
by quantifying IFN-gamma release and percentage of CD8* cells expressing 41BB 24 hours
after co-culture. The results are shown in Figures iA-iC and Tables 1-3. As shown in
Figures IA-1C and Tables 1-3, cells sorted according to expression of PD-I or TiM-3 were

                                             13
enriched for tumor-reactive cells as compared to cells that were negative for PD-I or TIM-3
expression, respectively.

[0048]       This example demonstrates the in vitro autologous tumor recognition of T cells
isolated from the peripheral blood of melanoma patients and sorted according to expression
of PD-i or TIM-3 after expanding the numbers of cells in vitro.
[0049]       Cells were obtained from the peripheral blood of patient 1913 or patient 3289 and
were sorted according to expression of PD-i or TIM-3 by FACS as described in Example 1.
The numbers of sorted cells were expanded for 14 days in vitro. On day 15, target tumor cell
                                                         51
lines (autologous and allogeneic) were labeled with         Cr and co-cultured for 4 hours with the
                                                                                       51
sorted populations of cells (effector cells) at the ratios shown in Figures 2A-2F.       Cr release
was determined in triplicate by 7-counting and the percentage of specific lysis was calculated
using the following formula: [(experimental counts per minute (cpm) - spontaneous
cpm)/(maximal cpm - spontaneous cpm)] x 100. The results are shown in Figures 2A-2F.
As shown in Figures 2A-2F, cells obtained from peripheral blood and sorted for PD-lI or
TIM-3+ expression are capable of lysing the autologous tumor cell line.
