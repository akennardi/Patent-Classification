            PLANTING SYSTEM FOR OPTIMIZATION OF PLANT GROWTH
FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE
[0001]      This disclosure relates to horticulture. More particularly, the disclosure relates to a
planting system that includes features for optimizing plant growth.
BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE
[0002]      It is often advantageous to grow and cultivate plants in containers rather than directly
in the ground, since containers allow greater control over the planting medium, and are less likely
to be exposed to parasites and weeds due to the separation of the planting medium in the container
from the ground soil. Containers also allow plants to be moved indoors during inclement weather.
However, traditional planters, which typically consist of a hard-sided plastic or ceramic pot having
a drainage hole or holes at the bottom, have several drawbacks. For instance, the hard-sided pot
may not allow an optimal level of oxygen to reach the roots because the surface area of the potting
soil is being put up against a hard, non-breathable surface such as ceramic or plastic, thereby
lowering the growth potential of the plants. In addition, overwatering can occur due to lack of
drainage if the drainage holes do not drain quickly enough. Finally, the plants become root-bound
very quickly with traditional planters because of the solid wall pot, especially if the pots are not
large enough, where the roots are circled and entangled in the planting medium and the future
growth of the plant is limited.
[0003]      Some of the problems associated with traditional planters are overcome by fabric
planters having porous sides and bottoms that allow oxygen to reach, and water to drain away
from, the roots of the plants. This allows the root tips to dehydrate, forcing the root tips to branch
out and become more productive. However, because such design increases the transpiration of the
planting medium, water tends to evaporate from the airy, porous fabric quicker which heightens
plant metabolism, causing plants to drink more water. Thus, the plants being grown in fabric
planters are prone to be underwatered because of their porous fabric.
[00041      Attempts have been made to combine the features of traditional and fabric planters by
providing ceramic or plastic pots with fabric liners. However, the drainage and oxygenation in
                                                  I

most of these hybrid systems is still inadequate because ultimately planting medium is pressed up
against the hard surface of the pot without a method of providing more oxygen to the root zone,
thus a new design for the pot is required to overcome this shortcoming. Furthermore, the roots of
the plants eventually grow through the fabric liners and may spiral, twist, kink, or become strangled
in the bottom of the pot. Combined with water tabling, where plant's roots mass sit in water that has
tabled upwards because of inadequate drainage, this can choke the plant when so much of the root
mass is under water.
[0005]      Another issue associated with planting systems is irrigation. Some planters position a
reservoir of water in direct contact with the planting medium, and rely on capillary action to draw
the water upwardly into the medium, which is also known as wicking system. A problem with this
type of a system is that the lower part of the planting medium is always wet. Since the lower roots
specialize in feeding, the constant excess moisture can slow growth and cause root disease. Other
planters use drip systems, in which a dripper is implanted in or suspended over the planting
medium. The dripper may be in the form of a ring having a number of drip holes formed along its
lower surface. However, conventional drip rings do not distribute water through the planting
medium in an optimum fashion, where the surface of the planting medium is not evenly saturated
leaving web and very dry zones.
[0006]      The above problems are addressed by this disclosure as summarized below.
SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE
[0007]      A planting system (or assembly) according to the present disclosure includes a pot
having a floor, and a grid disposed within the pot. The floor of the pot may function as a sump to
collect and direct excess water out of the pot. In one aspect of the disclosure, the grid is a slightly
concave plate that is inserted within the pot. The plate (or the grid) includes a plurality of apertures
that allow water and air to pass through. In addition, the apertures may be sized and configured to
allow roots of a plant in the pot to grow through. Slats extend downwardly from the plate and
divide the space beneath the plate into compartments that allow the roots to commingle but prevent
them from spiraling. The bottom end of each of the slats may be spaced above the floor of the pot.
This creates a permanent air space that allows the compartmentalized roots to sit in an oxygen
                                                   I

rich, moist environment, while removing risk of overwatering.
[0008]      In another aspect of the disclosure, the grid includes a peripheral side wall that lies
flush against the side wall of the pot. The bottom edge of the side wall may abut a shoulder formed
between a central portion and a lower portion of the side wall of the pot. Also, on the side of the
wall, there can be channels milled into the side which prevents the main soil compartment from
flooding by directing excess water into the sump (i.e., bottom floor_ and out via the irrigation
tubes.
[0009]      In still another aspect of the disclosure, a grid for placement in a pot having a floor
includes a plate defining a plurality of apertures sized and configured to allow roots of a plant to
pass through the plate, and a plurality of slats extending downwardly from the plate, the slats
defining a plurality of compartments configured to prevent the roots passing through the plate from
spiraling. In some embodiments, the slats intersect one another to form quadrilaterals. The plate
includes a peripheral side wall and a center, and may slope slightly downwardly towards the center.
The plate may slope downwardly in a continuous arc.
[0010]      In yet another aspect of the disclosure, a top feed spray planting system includes a pot
having a bottom floor with at least one drainage opening, a spray ring implanted in the planting
medium in an upper portion of the pot and configured to inject pressurized water downwardly into
the planting medium, and a grid disposed below the planting medium. The grid includes a plate
spaced above the bottom floor of the pot. The plate includes apertures configured to allow water
ejected from the spray ring to pass through the plate and air below the plate to pass into the planting
medium. A plurality of slats formed on the underside of the plate define a plurality of
compartments. The apertures may be sized and configured to allow roots to pass through the plate,
and the compartments defined by the slats may be configured to prevent the roots from spiraling.
The compartments may be configured as quadrilaterals. The top feed spray planting system may
also include a breathable liner disposed above the drainage grid.
[0011]      These and other features, aspects and advantages of the present invention will become
better understood with reference to the following drawings, description and claims.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT(S) AND
DISCLOSURE
[0037]      As required, detailed embodiments of the present invention are disclosed herein;
however, it is to be understood that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the
invention that may be embodied in various and alternative forms. The figures are not necessarily
to scale; some features may be exaggerated or minimized to show details of particular components.
Therefore, specific structural and functional details disclosed herein are not to be interpreted as
limiting, but merely as a representative basis for teaching one skilled in the art to variously employ
the present invention.
[00381      Figure 1 shows a pot 10 and base 12 of a planting system according to the present
disclosure. The pot 10 is generally cylindrical and has an outwardly extending rim 14 formed at
its upper end. A set of radially extending gripping members 15, 17, 19, and 21 are provided along
the rim 14. The base 12 is an annular member having open upper and lower ends 16, 18. A slightly
tapered side wall 20 extends between the ends 16, 18. The side wall 20 includes large openings 22

that allow irrigation lines 24 to pass through, as well as foot holes 26 that a user can step into while
pulling upward on gripping members 15, 17, 19, and 21 to separate the pot 10 from the base 12.
The base 12 may also include casters 28 enabling the pot 10 and base 12 to be easily moved from
one location to another. Both the pot 10 and base 12 may be made from molded thermoplastic
material. For instance, the pot 10, base 12 and all other parts in the disclosed planting system may
be made from acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) or high-density polyethylene (HDPE) or
combination thereof.
[0039]      As best seen in Figure 2, the pot 10 includes a side wall 30 having an upper side wall
portion 32, a central side wall portion 34, and a lower side wall portion 36. A short transition
surface 38 joins the upper side wall portion 32 to the central side wall portion 34 at an angle of
about 45', and a substantially perpendicular inner shoulder 40 joins the central side wall portion
34 to the lower side wall portion 36. The outer bottom surface of shoulder 40 abuts against the
upper end 16 of the base 14 when the pot 10 is inserted in the base as shown in Figure 1. The pot
 10 also includes a floor 42 having an outer peripheral portion 44 that extends substantially
perpendicularly to the lower side wall portion 36, and a sunken central portion 46 that functions
as a sump. The peripheral portion 44 and sunken central portion 46, both of which are substantially
planar, are joined to one another to one another by a curved transition portion 48. The transition
portion 48 includes a pair of drainage openings 50 configured to connect to the irrigation lines 24
shown in Figure 1.
[0040]      Figure 3 is a sectional view showing a top feed spray planting system according to the
present disclosure, including the pot 10 in combination with a drainage grid 52, a liner 54 filled
with planting medium 56, and a spray ring 58 configured to eject pressurized water into the
planting medium 56. The liner 54, which is positioned above the drainage grid 52, may be a
conventional liner formed from a breathable material that allows oxygen to reach the roots 53 of a
plant 51 in the planting medium 56, and also allows water ejected from the spray ring 58 to drain
out of the planting medium 56.
[0041]      Additional views of the drainage grid 52 are shown in Figures 4-7. Drainage grid 52
includes a plate 60 having a top surface 62 and a bottom surface 64. A plurality of apertures 66
extend through the top and bottom surfaces 62, 64 of the plate 60. The apertures 66 are sized and
                                                   r_:

configured to allow roots of a plant in the planting medium to extend through the plate 60.
Although shown here to be hexagonal, the apertures 66 need not be restricted to any particular
shape.
[0042]      Plate 60 is slightly concave. Otherwise stated, the plate 60 slopes slightly downwardly
toward the center 68 of the plate 60. In one embodiment of the invention wherein the pot is
configured to contain approximately 105 liters of planting medium, the plate 60 has a diameter of
about 22 inches and slopes downwardly in a continuous arc having a radius of curvature of about
 116 inches. The concavity of the plate 60 directs water inwardly toward the center 68 of the plate
60, where it passes through apertures 66 and collects in the sump formed by the sunken central
portion 46 of the floor of the pot 10, before finally draining out through drainage openings 50. The
overall size of the planting system and all its components, including the pot, grid/plate and base,
can be increased or decreased proportionally to create a planting system that can hold various
volume of planting medium depending on a user's preference, preferably between 15 liters to 130
liters.
[0043]      Plate 60 is spaced above the floor 42 of the pot 10 by a downwardly extending
peripheral side wall 70 that lies flush against the central side wall portion 34 of the pot and has a
bottom end 72 that abuts against the inner surface of shoulder 40 when inserted into the pot as
shown in Figure 3. The spacing between the plate 60 and the floor 42 defines a chamber 73
allowing air to circulate freely below the plate 60, providing the roots with oxygen to increase
plant metabolic rates and fruit yield. The fit between the side wall 70 and central side wall portion
34 is preferably tight enough to prevent leakage around the side wall. However, in some
embodiments, the fit may be somewhat loose, to allow the grid 52 to be removed and replaced.
[0044]      A plurality of intersecting slats 74 are formed on the bottom surface 64 of the plate 60.
Each slat 68 has a bottom end 76 that is vertically spaced from the sunken central portion 46 of
the floor 42 of the pot 10. The slats 74 provide rigidity and structural support to the plate 60 and
also divide the air chamber 73 beneath the plate 60 into separate compartments 75 that prevent
roots that have grown through the plate 60 from spiraling. In the illustrated embodiment, the
compartments 75 are diamond-shaped quadrilaterals, each of which circumscribes about four
apertures 66. This allows the roots 53 to commingle, while preventing them from becoming
                                                    -7

strangled at the bottom of the pot 10.
[0045]      As seen in Figure 8, spray ring 58 is an annular body 77 having a lower portion 78, a
cap 80, and circumferentially spaced apart ends 79, 81 that define a gap 83 of about 5 to 10 degrees.
The lower portion 78 and cap 80 may both be formed from a rugged plastic material such as ABS,
and may be secured to one another by any adhesion process such as ultrasonic welding, abs solvent
based adhesive or any similar techniques. One advantage of using ultrasonic welding or abs
solvent based adhesive is that it allows the spray ring 58 to withstand high water pressure and
increases the spray ring's 58 durability. The cap 80 includes a fitting 82 for receiving the outlet
of a hose or other conduit coupled to a source of pressurized water. The lower portion 78 includes
a set of downwardly extending sockets 84 for receiving the upper ends 86 of a set of legs 88. Each
leg 88 has a tapered lower end 90 allowing the legs 88 to be easily inserted into the planting
medium 56, as well as an annular stop flange 92 preventing the legs 88 from being inserted beyond
a predetermined depth. The annular stop flange 92 also allows the user to easily position the spray
ring 58 at right depth that provides the best geometric spray pattern.
[0046]      The underside of lower portion 78 includes a plurality of outlet openings, as shown in
Figure 9. More specifically, the outlet openings include a set of outer outlet openings 94a-l, a set
of central outlet openings 96a-1, and a set of inner outlet openings 98a-1. The outer, central outlet
openings are arranged in groups. Each group includes one outer outlet opening 94, one central
outlet opening 96, and one inner outlet opening 98. The three outlet openings 94, 96, 98 in each
group are radially aligned with one another, and the groups are spaced a uniform angular distance
from one another. In the illustrated embodiment, there are 12 groups of outlet openings, spaced at
30-degree intervals around the lower portion 78 of the spray ring 58.
[0047]      As seen in Figure 10, the lower portion 78 of the spray ring 58 is generally V-shaped
in cross-section, with an outer planar wall 100 intersecting an inner planar wall 102 at a flattened
vertex 104. Outer outlet opening 941 is formed in the outer planar wall 100; central outlet opening
961 is formed in the vertex 104; and inner outlet opening 981 is formed in the inner planar wall
102. The outer outlet opening 94/ is configured as a conical bore having an entrance end 106
defined in the inner surface 108 of outer planar wall 100 and an exit end 110 defined in the outer
surface 112 of outer planar wall 100. Similarly, the inner outlet opening 98/ is configured as a
                                                  0

conical bore having an entrance end 114 defined in the inner surface 116 of inner planar wall 102
and an exit end 118 defined in the outer surface 120 of inner planar wall 102. The central outlet
opening 961 is configured as a conical bore having an entrance end 122 formed in the inner surface
124 of the vertex 104 and end exit end 126 formed in the outer surface 128 of the vertex 104. The
entrance ends 106, 114, 122 of all three outlet openings 94/, 96/, and 98/ are smaller in cross
section than the corresponding exit ends 110, 118, 126. Central outlet opening 96/ is configured
as a right conical bore, and is a truncated isosceles triangle in cross-section. Outer outlet opening
94/ and inner outlet opening 98/ are truncated right triangles in cross-section.
[0048]       The outer outlet opening 94/ has an upper side wall 129 that intersects the outer surface
 112 of outer planar wall 100 at a right angle and a lower side wall 130 that intersects the outer
surface 112 of outer planar wall 100 at an oblique angle. Spray is emitted from the outer outlet
opening 941 in the form of a cone having an outer boundary 132 that is an extension of the upper
side wall 129, and an inner boundary 134 that is an extension of the lower side wall 130. Similarly,
spray is emitted from the inner outlet opening 98/ in the form of a cone having an outer boundary
 136 that is an extension of the upper side wall 138 of the inner outlet opening 98/, and an inner
boundary 140 that is an extension of the lower side wall 142 of the inner outlet opening 98/. Spray
is emitted from the central outlet opening 96/ in the form of a cone having outer and inner
boundaries 144, 146 that are extensions of the symmetrical side walls 148, 150, respectively, of
the central outlet opening 96/.
[0049]       The dimensions, positions, and geometry of the outlet openings 94a-/, 96a-/, and 98a
l, as well as the distance of the spray ring 58 at a predetermined height above the upper surface of
the planting medium 56 are selected to produce an optimum distribution of water throughout the
planting medium 56. The optimum distribution pattern, shown in the irrigation map of Figure 11,
comprises a set of concentric zones including a first dry zone 152 at the center of the pot 10, a
second dry zone 154 adjacent the outer side wall 30 of the pot 10, and a wet zone 156 located
between the two dry zones 152, 154. The first dry zone 152 is a circular area having a radius R
that is selected to keep moisture away from the stem 51 of the plant, thus reducing the possibility
of stem rot. In a preferred embodiment, R=4 inches, although larger or smaller dry zones maybe
preferable for different types of plants. The second dry zone is an annular area having a width W
selected to prevent water from running down the sides of the pot and being wasted. In the preferred
                                                    a

embodiment, W=1 inch.
[0050]       The inner boundary 158 ofthe wet zone 156, which also functions as the outer boundary
of the first dry zone 152, is defined by a circle connecting 12 inner spray points 160a-l. The outer
boundary 162 of the wet zone 156, which also functions as the inner boundary of the second dry
zone 154, is defined by a circle connecting 12 outer spray points 164a-l. A set of 12 central spray
points 166a-l is located midway between the inner spray points 160a-l and the outer spray points
164a-l.
[0051]       To ensure that the first and second dry zones 152, 154 stay dry, and that the wet zone
156 is substantially evenly saturated throughout, the designer must select the radius and height of
the spray ring 58, as well as the geometry, dimensions, and positions of the outlet openings 94a-l,
96a-l, and 98a-l such that: 1) the outer boundary 132 of the spray emitted from each of the outer
outlet openings 94a-l contacts the planting medium at a corresponding one of the outer spray points
164a-1; 2) the outer boundary 136 of the spray emitted from each of the inner outlet openings 98a
I contacts the planting medium at a corresponding one of the inner spray points 160a-1; and 3) each
of the central inlet openings 96a-l is located directly below a corresponding central outlet opening
96a-l.
[0052]       In one example, a spray ring having the outlet geometry illustrated in Figure 10, with
an inner diameter of 14.350 inches, an outer diameter of 16.713, and the outlet dimensions listed
in Table I was positioned 2.37 inches above the top surface of the planting medium in a pot having
a capacity of up to 105 liters and an inner diameter of 25.5 inches at its top end. When pressurized
water was injected into the ring at a rate of 500-1000 gallons per hour, the spray emitted from the
outlets created an evenly saturated annular wet zone around the stem of a plant in the center of the
pot, while leaving a first dry zone adjacent the stem and a second dry zone adjacent the outer side
wall of the pot. The first dry zone was a circular area measuring about 4 inches in diameter, and
the second dry zone was an annular area measuring about 1 inch in width. Rings for use with
smaller or larger pots can be designed by adjusting the dimensions listed in this example
proportionately to the size of the pots.

100531      Figure 12 demonstrates another embodiment of the disclosed planting system (or
assembly) with slightly different configurations for base 170, grid 175 and spray ring 58. As
shown by Figures 13 to 15 (exploded views of Figure 12), unlike the base 12 in Figure 1, the
base 170 in this embodiment does not have any casters 28. Instead, the base has two openings
174 for water supply pipe 174 (i.e., source of pressurized water for the spray ring) and two
openings 172 for water drainage pipe 173 at the bottom of the base 170. As shown by Figure
25, the base 170 is also an annular member having open upper and lower ends. An advantage
for the base 170 is that it allows multiple planting systems (or assemblies) to be connected in
series through same water supply pipe 174 and water drainage pipe(s) 173. Also, this design
potentially reduces the manufacturing cost for the base and is convenient for multiple pots that
do not require constant moving.
100541      As demonstrated by Figures 17 and 19, the two openings 171 on the base 170 allows
the water supply pipe 174 to go through and underneath the base 170, where the water supply
pipe 174 is further connected to the fitting 82 of the spray ring 58, thereby providing the spray
ring 58 with water source. Similarly, the two openings 172 allows the drainage openings 50 on
pot 10 to connect to drainage pipes 173 on both sides of the pot 10.
10055]      To strengthen the pot 10's attachment to the base 170, the base 170 may optionally
have a hole 178 in the center where the hole 178 is connected to the sidewall of the base 170
through supporting member(s) 179 as shown by Figure 25. The supporting member 179 may
                                                    11

be a single circular piece that attaches to the sidewall of the base 170 to the extend it can, or it
can be multiple pieces as shown by Figure 25. As shown by Figures 13 to 15, the hole 178
allows the base 170 to be secured to the pot 10 through a screw 176. There will also be a screw
hole 180 located at the bottom and center of the pot 10 for receiving the screw 176.               As
previously mentioned, all the parts in the disclosed planting system may be made from
acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) or high-density polyethylene (HDPE) or combination
thereof Since there may be circumstances where a user does not require drainage of water at all
or only needs drainage on one side of the pot 10, the disclosed planting system may further
include drainage hole screws 177 that is capable of sealing the drainage openings 50 on pot 10
as shown by Figure 14. Note while base 12 in Figure 1 does not show the center hole 178 and the
screw 176, same configuration can be applied to it.
[0056]       Figures 21 to 24 are different views of grid 175 used by the embodiment in Figures
13 to 15. Grid 175 here is different from grid 52 in Figures 4 to 7 in that it has plurality of small
openings 181 on its edge. With these small openings 181, the grid 175 (or the plate) does not
necessary need to be slightly concaved because excess water on the sides or edge of the pot can
be drained through small openings 181 (instead of forcing them towards center and drained
through apertures 66 through downward slope). The small openings 181 can be configured in a
way that they are spread evenly on the edge of the grid 175 (e.g., equal distance from each other).
Similarly, as shown by Figures 23 and 24, a plurality of slats 74 extending downwardly from the
grid 175 are formed on the bottom surface of the grid 175 (or plate) and are connected with each
other to create a plurality of compartments filled with air, and also provide rigidity and structural
support to the grid 175. The plurality of compartments filled with air provide roots of a plant with
spaces to grow through the grid's plurality of apertures and prevent the roots from spiraling,
thereby enhance the growth of the plant. Grid 175 in this embodiment is different from gird 52 in
Fig. 7 in that each aperture 66 corresponds to just one compartment 75 unlike the grid 52 in Fig. 7
where multiple apertures correspond to one compartment.           Depending on the type of plants
planted, this design may further enhance the ability of the grid 175 to prevent roots that have grown
through the grid 175 from spiraling and may provide even more oxygen for the roots. In the
illustrated embodiment, while the compartments 75 here are hexagonal (e.g., formed by six slats
connected to each other), which corresponds to the shape of the apertures 66, the compartment 75
                                                 11)

and the apertures 66 need not be restricted to any particular shape (i.e., it can also be circular or
other polygonal shapes). Note grid 175 in Figures 21 to 24 can be used interchangeably with grid
52 in Figures 4 to 7 within pot 10. Preferably, the plurality of intersecting slats 74 should be
configured to have at least twenty compartments 75, preferably between thirty to forty-five
compartments. However, the number of compartments 75 created can be further increased or
decreased depending in part on the characteristic of a plant's roots and the shape of the
compartment. For instance, for compartments in the shape of hexagon, thirty to forty, specifically
31 and 37, compartments are considered most proper.
[00571       Figures 16 to 19 are top views and sectional views for the planting system of Figure
22. Here, the spray ring 58 is connected to the pot 10 through planting medium 56. Depending
on the size of the pot, the fitting 82 for receiving the outlet of a hose or other conduit coupled to
a source of pressurized water can be extended to the side of the pot as shown by the figures. Figure
20 provides a more detailed view for the spray ring 58 with extended fitting 82, which is slightly
different from the one shown by Figure 8. However, they can be used interchangeable by the
disclosed planting system depending on the user's preference.
[0058]       In yet another embodiment of the present disclosure, a method of enhancing a plant's
growth using the planting system (or assembly) shown by Figures 12 to 25 is disclosed. The
method comprises: 1) preparing a planting system or assembly that has a pot having a floor with
at least one drainage hole on the floor, and preferably two drainage holes which prevents the pot
from flooding if one hole becomes blocked (e.g., by root tissue or planting medium etc.); a grid
inserted within the pot at bottom near the floor, where the grid has a plurality of apertures, and a
plurality of slats extending downwardly from the grid which connected with each other to create a
plurality of compartments filled with air (where the plurality of compartments filled with air are
intended to provide roots of a plant with spaces to grow through the grid's plurality of apertures
and prevent the roots from spiraling) and a base detachable to the pot and provides support to the
pot; 2) placing a planting medium (e.g., soil) into the pot and optionally a liner between the planting
medium and the pot so the space above the grid is fully or partially filled with the planting medium;
3) planting a plant or plants into the planting medium (as depicted by Figures 3, 17 and 19). Using
the disclosed planting system, the roots of the plant will grow through the grids into the plurality
of compartments, where they can receive more air than conventional planting system, thereby

enhancing the plant's growth.
[0059]      The method may further comprise the step of placing a spray ring in the planting
medium (e.g., by inserting legs of the spray ring into the soil) that can provide nearly 360-degree
watering around the plant (as the one shown by Figures 8 to 11 or Figure 20), where the spray may
receive water from a water supply that runs beneath and pass through the base of the planting
system. Multiple planting systems can also be used and connected in series at the same time
through the same water supply pipe and drainage pipe(s).
[0060]      As described above, the grid has a plurality of small openings on its edge to allow
excess water from planting medium to pass through the grid from the edge (if they are closer to
the edge) and into the floor of the pot, where the collected excess water is configured to be
drained through the drainage hole(s). Similarly, as shown by Figures 23 and 24, a plurality of
slats extending downwardly from the grid are formed on the bottom surface of the grid (or plate)
and are connected with each other to create a plurality of compartments filled with air, and also
provide rigidity and structural support to the grid. The plurality of compartments filled with air
provide roots of a plant with spaces to grow through the grid's plurality of apertures and prevent
the roots from spiraling, thereby enhance the growth of the plant. Each aperture of the grid is
configured to correspond to j ist one compartment. The compartments may be hexagonal (e.g.,
formed by six slats connected to each other) which corresponds to the shape of the apertures, but
it may also be in other shapes such as circular or other polygonal shapes. Preferably, the shape of
each compartment (horizontal shape) is the same as the shape of the aperture.
100611      It should also be noted that when the term "a", "an", etc. is used, it is to be interpreted
as "at least one" throughout the application, drawings, and claims.

to make and use what is considered presently to be the best mode thereof, those of ordinary skill
will understand and appreciate the existence of variations, combinations, and equivalents of the
specific embodiment, method, and examples herein. The invention should therefore not be limited
by the above described embodiment, method, and examples, but by all embodiments and methods
within the scope and spirit of the invention as claimed.
