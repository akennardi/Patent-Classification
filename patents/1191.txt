ABSTRACT
The present invention provides antibodies that bind to the cat allergen, Fel dl, compositions
comprising the antibodies, nucleic acids encoding the antibodies and methods of use of the
antibodies. According to certain embodiments of the invention, the antibodies are fully human
monoclonal antibodies that bind to Fel dl. The antibodies of the invention are useful for
binding to the Fel d1 allergen in vivo, thus preventing binding of the Fel d1 allergen to pre
formed IgE on the surface of mast cells or basophils. In doing so, the antibodies act to
prevent the release of histamine and other inflammatory mediators from mast cells and/or
basophils, thus ameliorating the untoward response to the cat allergen in sensitized
individuals. The antibodies of the invention may also be useful for diagnostic purposes to
determine if a patient is allergic to the Fel d1 cat allergen.

                                  STATEMENT OF RELATED ART
[0002] The Fel d1 protein is a secreted cat protein, which belongs to the secretoglobin family
of small disulfide linked heterodimeric proteins found only in mammals (Klug, J. et al. (2000),
Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 923:348-354). It is the major cause of cat allergies in humans (Platts
Mills, T.A., et al. (1997), J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 100:S2-S24). About 90-95% of patients
allergic to cats have an IgE response to the Fel d 1 protein (van Ree, et al. (1999), J. Allergy
Clin. Immunol. 104:1223-1230). The symptoms in a patient who experiences an allergic
response to Fel d1 can range from mild rhinitis and conjunctivitis to life-threatening asthmatic
responses. Fel d1 is produced by sebaceous glands and squamous glands and squamous
epithelial cells and is transferred to the pelt by licking and grooming (Bartholome, K. et al.
(1985), J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 76:503-506; Charpin, C. et al.(1991), J. Allergy Clin.
Immunol. 88:77-82; Dabrowski, A.J. (1990), et al.J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 86:462-465). It is
also present in the salivary, perianal and lachrymal glands (Andersen, M.C., et al. (1985), J.
Allergy Clin. Immunol. 76:563-569; van Milligen, F.J. (1992), et al., Int. Arch. Allergy Appl.
Immunol. 92(4):375-378) and the principal reservoirs appear to be the skin and the fur (Mata,
P. et al. (1992), Ann. Allergy 69(4):321-322).
[0003] Natural Fel d1 is an approximately 18 kDa heterodimeric glycoprotein. Each
heterodimer comprises two polypeptide chains, which are covalently linked by three inter
chain disulfide bonds and which are encoded by two separate genes (Duffort, OA, et al.,
(1991), Mol. Immunol. 28:301-309; Morgenstern, JP, etal., (1991), PNAS 88:9690-9694;
Griffith, I.J., et al.(1992), Gene 113:263-268; Kristensen, A.K. et al.(1997), Biol. Chem.
378:899-908). Chain 1 comprises 70 amino acid residues and chain 2 comprises about 90
92 amino acid residues. Structurally the two chains are similar, but have only 10-15%
sequence identity (Kaiser, L. etal. (2003), J. Biol. Chem. 278(39):37730-37735). Although
each chain is sometimes individually referred to as Fel dl, both chains are needed for the full
protein allergen.
                                                   1

[0004] The Fel d1 protein is of an unknown function to the animal but causes an IgG or IgE
reaction in sensitive humans (either as an allergic or asthmatic response). Although other cat
allergens are known, including Fel d2 (albumin) and Fel d3 (cystatin), 60% to 90% of the anti
cat IgE produced is directed against Fel d1 (Leitermann, K. et al., (1984), J Allergy Clin.
Immunol. 74:147-153; Lowenstein, H. et al., (1985), Allergy 40:430-441; van Ree, R. et al.,

[0005] Immunoglobulin E (IgE) is responsible for type 1 hypersensitivity, which manifests itself in
allergic rhinitis, allergic conjunctivitis, hay fever, allergic asthma, bee venom allergy, and food
allergies. IgE circulates in the blood and binds to high-affinity FcSRla receptors for IgE on
basophils and mast cells. In most allergic responses, the allergens enter the body through
inhalation, ingestion, or through the skin. The allergen then binds to preformed IgE already bound
to the high affinity receptor on the surfaces of mast cells and basophils, resulting in cross-linking of
several IgE molecules and triggering the release of histamine and other inflammatory mediators
causing the various allergic symptoms.
[0006] The treatment for allergies includes steroids for suppressing the immune activity and
bronchial dilators for relieving asthma symptoms. Desensitization therapy is also used for severely
allergic patients. Peptide vaccine combinations have been tested for desensitizing individuals to
particular allergens, e.g. Fel dl (See US2010/0239599A1 and EP2380591A2). Antibodies have
been proposed as a treatment for allergies, since they may be able to block the entry of allergenic
molecules into the mucosal tissues, or may bind the allergen before it has the opportunity to bind to
the IgE bound to the high affinity receptor on mast cells or basophils, thus preventing the release of
histamine and other inflammatory mediators from these cells.
[0007] U.S. patent number 5,670,626 describes the use of monoclonal antibodies for the treatment
of IgE-mediated allergic diseases such as allergic rhinitis, allergic asthma, and allergic conjunctivitis
by blocking the binding of allergens to the mucosal tissue. U.S. patent number 6,849,259
describes the use of allergen-specific antibodies to inhibit allergic inflammation in an in vivo mouse
model of allergy. Milk-based and egg-based antibody systems have been described. For example,
US20030003133A1 discloses using milk as a carrier for allergens for inducing oral tolerance to cat
dander and other allergens. Compositions and methods for reducing an allergic response in an
animal to an allergen in the environment through use of a molecule that inhibits the ability of the
allergen to bind to mast cells was described in US2010/0143266. Other antibodies to Fel dl were
described by de Groot et. al. (de Groot et. al., (1988), J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 82:778-786).
                                 BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
[0008] The invention provides fully human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and antigen-binding
fragments thereof that bind specifically to the cat allergen, Fel dl. Such antibodies may be useful
to bind the Fel dl allergen in vivo following exposure of a sensitized patient to the cat allergen, and
as such, may act to either promote clearance of Fel dl or to block the binding of the allergen to pre
formed IgE on the surface of mast cells or basophils. By doing so, the antibodies of the invention
may prevent the release of histamine or other inflammatory mediators from mast cells or basophils,
thereby preventing or diminishing the untoward effects observed in patients sensitized to the cat
                                                        2

      WO 2013/166236                                                           PCT/US2013/039192
allergen.    In certain embodiments, the antibodies may be capable of reducing, minimizing, or
preventing at least one symptom in a patient sensitive to the Fel dl cat allergen, such as sneezing,
congestion, nasal blockage, coughing, wheezing, bronchoconstriction, rhinitis, or conjunctivitis. In
certain embodiments, the antibodies may be capable of preventing even more serious in vivo
complications associated with exposure to the cat allergen in sensitized individuals, such as
asthmatic responses, anaphylaxis, or even death.
[0009] The antibodies of the invention can be full-length (for example, an IgG1 or IgG4 antibody) or
may comprise only an antigen-binding portion (for example, a Fab, F(ab') 2 or scFv fragment), and
may be modified to affect functionality, e.g., to eliminate residual effector functions (Reddy et al.,
(2000), J. Immunol. 164:1925-1933).
[0010] A first aspect of the invention provides an isolated human monoclonal antibody or antigen
binding fragment thereof that binds specifically to Fel dl.
[0011] In one embodiment, the antibody or antigen binding fragment thereof is an isotype other
than an IgA isotype.
[0012] In one embodiment, the isolated human antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof has
an isotype selected from the group consisting of an IgG1, an IgG2 and an IgG4.
[0013] In one embodiment, the isolated human antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof binds
specifically to Fel dl with a KD equal to or less than 10-6 M. In one embodiment, the isolated human
antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof binds specifically to Fel dl with a    KD equal to or less
than 1.8 nM.
[0014] In one embodiment, the isolated human antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof
comprises the three heavy chain CDRs (HCDR1, HCDR2 and HCDR3) contained within any one of
the heavy chain variable region (HCVR) sequences selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID
NOs: 2,18,34,50,66,82,98,114,130,146,162,178,194,210,226,242,258,274, 290, 306,
322, 338, 354, 370 and 460; and the three light chain CDRs (LCDR1, LCDR2 and LCDR3)
contained within any one of the light chain variable region (LCVR) sequences selected from the
group consisting of SEQ ID NOs: 10, 26, 42, 58, 74, 90, 106, 122, 138, 154, 170, 186, 202, 218,
234, 250, 266, 282, 298, 314, 330, 346, 362, 378 and 468. Methods and techniques for identifying
CDRs within HCVR and LCVR amino acid sequences are well known in the art and can be used to
identify CDRs within the specified HCVR and/or LCVR amino acid sequences disclosed herein.
Exemplary conventions that can be used to identify the boundaries of CDRs include, e.g., the
Kabat definition, the Chothia definition, and the AbM definition. In general terms, the Kabat
definition is based on sequence variability, the Chothia definition is based on the location of the
structural loop regions, and the AbM definition is a compromise between the Kabat and Chothia
approaches. See, e.g., Kabat, "Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest," National
Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md. (1991); Al-Lazikani et al., (1997), J. Mol. Biol. 273:927-948; and

greater than 90%, and even more preferably greater than 95%. The amino acid sequence of chain
2 of Fel dl is also provided in GenBank as accession number P30440, or as accession number

[0121] The term "Fel dl fragment" as used herein, refers to a polypeptide comprising or
alternatively consisting of, at least one antigenic site of Fel dl. In one embodiment, the term "Fel
dl fragment" as used herein, refers to a polypeptide comprising or alternatively consisting of at
least two antigenic sites of Fel dl. In one embodiment, the antigenic sites are covalently linked. In
one embodiment, the antigenic sites are linked by at least one peptide bond. In one embodiment,
the two antigenic sites are linked by at least one peptide bond and a spacer between the antigenic
sites. In one embodiment, the at least two antigenic sites derive from both chain 1 of Fel dl and
from chain 2 of Fel dl. In one embodiment, the at least two antigenic sites comprise amino acid
sequences 23-92 of GenBank accession number P30438 and amino acid sequences 18-109 of
GenBank accession number P30440. In one embodiment, the at least two antigenic sites derive

 Fel dl fragments are capable of inducing the production of antibodies in vivo that specifically bind
to naturally occurring Fel dl, or to recombinantly produced Fel dl.
[0122] The term "antibody", as used herein, means any antigen-binding molecule or molecular
complex comprising at least one complementarity determining region (CDR) that specifically binds
to or interacts with a particular antigen (e.g., Fel dl). The term "antibody", as used herein, is
intended to refer to immunoglobulin molecules comprised of four polypeptide chains, two heavy (H)
chains and two light (L) chains inter-connected by disulfide bonds (i.e., "full antibody molecules"),
as well as multimers thereof (e.g. IgM) or antigen-binding fragments thereof. Each heavy chain is
comprised of a heavy chain variable region ("HCVR" or "VH") and a heavy chain constant region
(comprised of domains      CH
                             1
                               , CH2 and CH3 ). Each light chain is comprised of a light chain variable
region ("LCVR or "VL") and a light chain constant region (CL). The VH and VL regions can be further
subdivided into regions of hypervariability, termed complementarity determining regions (CDR),
interspersed with regions that are more conserved, termed framework regions (FR). Each          VH  and
VL is composed of three CDRs and four FRs, arranged from amino-terminus to carboxy-terminus in
the following order: FR1, CDR1, FR2, CDR2, FR3, CDR3, FR4. In certain embodiments of the
invention, the FRs of the antibody (or antigen binding fragment thereof) may be identical to the
human germline sequences, or may be naturally or artificially modified. An amino acid consensus
sequence may be defined based on a side-by-side analysis of two or more CDRs.
[0123] Substitution of one or more CDR residues or omission of one or more CDRs is also
possible. Antibodies have been described in the scientific literature in which one or two CDRs can
be dispensed with for binding. Padlan et al. (1995 FASEB J. 9:133-139) analyzed the contact
regions between antibodies and their antigens, based on published crystal structures, and
concluded that only about one fifth to one third of CDR residues actually contact the antigen.
  Padlan also found many antibodies in which one or two CDRs had no amino acids in contact with
an antigen (see also, Vajdos et al. (2002), J Mol Biol 320:415-428).
[0124] CDR residues not contacting antigen can be identified based on previous studies (for
example residues H60-H65 in CDRH2 are often not required), from regions of Kabat CDRs
lying outside Chothia CDRs, by molecular modeling and/or empirically. If a CDR or residue(s)
thereof is omitted, it is usually substituted with an amino acid occupying the corresponding position
in another human antibody sequence or a consensus of such sequences. Positions for substitution
within CDRs and amino acids to substitute can also be selected empirically. Empirical substitutions
can be conservative or non-conservative substitutions.
[0125] The fully human monoclonal antibodies that specifically bind to Fel dl, as disclosed herein,
may comprise one or more amino acid substitutions, insertions and/or deletions in the framework
and/or CDR regions of the heavy and light chain variable domains as compared to the
corresponding germline sequences. Such mutations can be readily ascertained by comparing the
                                                     22

     WO 2013/166236                                                          PCT/US2013/039192
amino acid sequences disclosed herein to germline sequences available from, for example, public
antibody sequence databases. The present invention includes antibodies, and antigen-binding
fragments thereof, which are derived from any of the amino acid sequences disclosed herein,
wherein one or more amino acids within one or more framework and/or CDR regions are mutated
to the corresponding residue(s) of the germline sequence from which the antibody was derived, or
to the corresponding residue(s) of another human germline sequence, or to a conservative amino
acid substitution of the corresponding germline residue(s) (such sequence changes are referred to
herein collectively as "germline mutations"). A person of ordinary skill in the art, starting with the
heavy and light chain variable region sequences disclosed herein, can easily produce numerous
antibodies and antigen-binding fragments which comprise one or more individual germline
mutations or combinations thereof. In certain embodiments, all of the framework and/or CDR
residues within the VH and/or VL domains are mutated back to the residues found in the original
germline sequence from which the antibody was derived. In other embodiments, only certain
residues are mutated back to the original germline sequence, e.g., only the mutated residues found
within the first 8 amino acids of FR1 or within the last 8 amino acids of FR4, or only the mutated
residues found within CDR1, CDR2 or CDR3. In other embodiments, one or more of the
framework and/or CDR residue(s) are mutated to the corresponding residue(s) of a different
germline sequence (i.e., a germline sequence that is different from the germline sequence from
which the antibody was originally derived). Furthermore, the antibodies of the present invention
may contain any combination of two or more germline mutations within the framework and/or CDR
regions, e.g., wherein certain individual residues are mutated to the corresponding residue of a
particular germline sequence while certain other residues that differ from the original germline
sequence are maintained or are mutated to the corresponding residue of a different germline
sequence. Once obtained, antibodies and antigen-binding fragments that contain one or more
germline mutations can be easily tested for one or more desired property such as, improved
binding specificity, increased binding affinity, improved or enhanced antagonistic or agonistic
biological properties (as the case may be), reduced immunogenicity, etc. Antibodies and antigen
binding fragments obtained in this general manner are encompassed within the present invention.
[0126] The present invention also includes fully human monoclonal antibodies comprising variants
of any of the HCVR, LCVR, and/or CDR amino acid sequences disclosed herein having one or
more conservative substitutions. For example, the present invention includes antibodies having
HCVR, LCVR, and/or CDR amino acid sequences with, e.g., 10 or fewer, 8 or fewer, 6 or fewer, 4
or fewer, etc. conservative amino acid substitutions relative to any of the HCVR, LCVR, and/or
CDR amino acid sequences disclosed herein.
[0127] The term "human antibody", as used herein, is intended to include antibodies having
variable and constant regions derived from human germline immunoglobulin sequences. The
                                                    23

      WO 2013/166236                                                             PCT/US2013/039192
human mAbs of the invention may include amino acid residues not encoded by human germline
immunoglobulin sequences (e.g., mutations introduced by random or site-specific mutagenesis in
vitro or by somatic mutation in vivo), for example in the CDRs and in particular CDR3. However,
the term "human antibody", as used herein, is not intended to include mAbs in which CDR
sequences derived from the germline of another mammalian species (e.g., mouse), have been
grafted onto human FR sequences.
[0128] As used herein, the expression "antigen-binding molecule" means a protein, polypeptide or
molecular complex comprising or consisting of at least one complementarity determining region
(CDR) that alone, or in combination with one or more additional CDRs and/or framework regions
(FRs), specifically binds to a particular antigen. In certain embodiments, an antigen-binding
molecule is an antibody or a fragment of an antibody, as those terms are defined elsewhere herein.
[0129] As used herein, the expression "bi-specific antigen-binding molecule" means a protein,
polypeptide or molecular complex comprising at least a first antigen-binding domain and a second
antigen-binding domain (i.e. two arms). Each antigen-binding domain within the bi-specific antigen
binding molecule comprises at least one CDR that alone, or in combination with one or more
additional CDRs and/or FRs, specifically binds to a particular antigen. In the context of the present
invention, the first antigen-binding domain specifically binds a first antigen on Fel dl and the
second antigen-binding domain specifically binds a second, distinct antigen on Fel dl.
[0130] The term "specifically binds," or "binds specifically to", or the like, means that an antibody or
antigen-binding fragment thereof forms a complex with an antigen that is relatively stable under
physiologic conditions. Specific binding can be characterized by an equilibrium dissociation
constant of at least about 1x10-6 M or less (e.g., a smaller   KD  denotes a tighter binding). Methods
for determining whether two molecules specifically bind are well known in the art and include, for
example, equilibrium dialysis, surface plasmon resonance, and the like. As described herein,
antibodies have been identified by surface plasmon resonance, e.g., BIACORE            TM
                                                                                          , which bind
specifically to Fel dl. Moreover, multi-specific antibodies that bind to Fel dl and one or more
additional antigens or a bi-specific that binds to two different regions of Fel dl (for example, chain 1
and/or chain 2 of Fel dl) are nonetheless considered antibodies that "specifically bind", as used
herein.
[0131] The term "high affinity" antibody refers to those mAbs having a binding affinity to Fel dl,
expressed as    KD, of at least 108 M; preferably 10-9 M; more preferably 10-10 M, even more preferably
10-11 M, even more preferably 10-12 M, as measured by surface plasmon resonance, e.g.,
BIACORE T M or solution-affinity ELISA.
[0132] By the term "slow off rate", "Koff" or "kd" is meant an antibody that dissociates from Fel d1,
with a rate constant of 1 x 10-3 s-1 or less, preferably 1 x 10-4 s-1 or less, as determined by surface
plasmon resonance, e.g., BIACORE        TM.

      WO 2013/166236                                                           PCT/US2013/039192
[0133] The terms "antigen-binding portion" of an antibody, "antigen-binding fragment" of an
antibody, and the like, as used herein, include any naturally occurring, enzymatically obtainable,
synthetic, or genetically engineered polypeptide or glycoprotein that specifically binds an antigen to
form a complex. The terms "antigen-binding portion" of an antibody, or "antibody fragment", as
used herein, refers to one or more fragments of an antibody that retain the ability to bind to Fel dl.
[0134] The specific embodiments, antibody or antibody fragments of the invention may be
conjugated to a therapeutic moiety ("immunoconjugate"), such as a corticosteroid, a second anti
Fel dl antibody, or epinephrine, a vaccine, or any other therapeutic moiety useful for treating an
allergic response to Fel dl.
[0135] An "isolated antibody", as used herein, is intended to refer to an antibody that is
substantially free of other antibodies (Abs) having different antigenic specificities (e.g., an isolated
antibody that specifically binds Fel dl, or a fragment thereof, is substantially free of Abs that
specifically bind antigens other than Fel dl.
[0136] A "blocking antibody" or a "neutralizing antibody", as used herein (or an "antibody that
neutralizes Fel dl activity"), is intended to refer to an antibody, or an antigen binding portion
thereof, whose binding to Fel dl results in inhibition of at least one biological activity of Fel dl. For
example, an antibody of the invention may aid in preventing the primary allergic response to Fel dl.
Alternatively, an antibody of the invention may demonstrate the ability to prevent a secondary
allergic response to Fel dl, or at least one symptom of an allergic response to Fel dl, including
sneezing, coughing, an asthmatic condition, or an anaphylactic response caused by Fel dl. This
inhibition of the biological activity of Fel dl can be assessed by measuring one or more indicators
of Fel dl biological activity by one or more of several standard in vitro or in vivo assays (such as a
passive cutaneous anaphylaxis assay, as described herein) or other in vivo assays known in the art
(for example, other animal models to look at protection from challenge with Fel dl following
administration of one or more of the antibodies described herein).
[0137] The term "surface plasmon resonance", as used herein, refers to an optical phenomenon
that allows for the analysis of real-time biomolecular interactions by detection of alterations in
protein concentrations within a biosensor matrix, for example using the BIACORE        TM  system
(Pharmacia Biosensor AB, Uppsala, Sweden and Piscataway, N.J.).
[0138] The term "KD ", as used herein, is intended to refer to the equilibrium dissociation constant
of a particular antibody-antigen interaction.
[0139] The term "epitope" refers to an antigenic determinant that interacts with a specific antigen
binding site in the variable region of an antibody molecule known as a paratope. A single antigen
may have more than one epitope. Thus, different antibodies may bind to different areas on an
antigen and may have different biological effects. The term "epitope" also refers to a site on an
antigen to which B and/or T cells respond. It also refers to a region of an antigen that is bound by
                                                     25

      WO 2013/166236                                                          PCT/US2013/039192
an antibody. Epitopes may be either linear or conformational. A linear epitope is one produced by
adjacent amino acid residues in a polypeptide chain. A conformational epitope is produced by
spatially juxtaposed amino acids from different segments of the linear polypeptide chain. In certain
embodiments, epitopes may include determinants that are chemically active surface groupings of
molecules such as amino acids, sugar side chains, phosphoryl groups, or sulfonyl groups, and, in
certain embodiments, may have specific three-dimensional structural characteristics, and/or
specific charge characteristics. Epitopes may also be defined as structural or functional. Functional
epitopes are generally a subset of the structural epitopes and have those residues that directly
contribute to the affinity of the interaction. Epitopes formed from contiguous amino acids are
typically retained on exposure to denaturing solvents, whereas epitopes formed by tertiary folding
are typically lost on treatment with denaturing solvents. An epitope typically includes at least 3, and
more usually, at least 5 or 8-10 amino acids in a unique spatial conformation.
[0140] The term "substantial identity" or "substantially identical," when referring to a nucleic acid or
fragment thereof, indicates that, when optimally aligned with appropriate nucleotide insertions or
deletions with another nucleic acid (or its complementary strand), there is nucleotide sequence
identity in at least about 90%, and more preferably at least about 95%, 96%, 97%, 98% or 99% of
the nucleotide bases, as measured by any well-known algorithm of sequence identity, such as
FASTA, BLAST or GAP, as discussed below. A nucleic acid molecule having substantial identity to
a reference nucleic acid molecule may, in certain instances, encode a polypeptide having the same
or substantially similar amino acid sequence as the polypeptide encoded by the reference nucleic
acid molecule.
[0141] As applied to polypeptides, the term "substantial similarity" or "substantially similar" means
that two peptide sequences, when optimally aligned, such as by the programs GAP or BESTFIT
using default gap weights, share at least 90% sequence identity, even more preferably at least
95%, 98% or 99% sequence identity. Preferably, residue positions, which are not identical, differ
by conservative amino acid substitutions. A "conservative amino acid substitution" is one in which
an amino acid residue is substituted by another amino acid residue having a side chain (R group)
with similar chemical properties (e.g., charge or hydrophobicity). In general, a conservative amino
acid substitution will not substantially change the functional properties of a protein. In cases where
two or more amino acid sequences differ from each other by conservative substitutions, the percent
or degree of similarity may be adjusted upwards to correct for the conservative nature of the
substitution. Means for making this adjustment are well known to those of skill in the art. (See,
e.g., Pearson (1994) Methods Mol. Biol. 24: 307-331). Examples of groups of amino acids that
have side chains with similar chemical properties include 1) aliphatic side chains: glycine, alanine,
valine, leucine and isoleucine; 2) aliphatic-hydroxyl side chains: serine and threonine; 3) amide
containing side chains: asparagine and glutamine; 4) aromatic side chains: phenylalanine, tyrosine,
                                                     26

     WO 2013/166236                                                          PCT/US2013/039192
and tryptophan; 5) basic side chains: lysine, arginine, and histidine; 6) acidic side chains: aspartate
and glutamate, and 7) sulfur-containing side chains: cysteine and methionine. Preferred
conservative amino acids substitution groups are: valine-leucine-isoleucine, phenylalanine-tyrosine,
lysine-arginine, alanine-valine, glutamate-aspartate, and asparagine-glutamine. Alternatively, a
conservative replacement is any change having a positive value in the PAM250 log-likelihood
matrix disclosed in Gonnet et al. ((1992) Science 256: 1443 45). A "moderately conservative"
replacement is any change having a nonnegative value in the PAM250 log-likelihood matrix.
[0142] Sequence similarity for polypeptides is typically measured using sequence analysis
software. Protein analysis software matches similar sequences using measures of similarity
assigned to various substitutions, deletions and other modifications, including conservative amino
acid substitutions. For instance, GCG software contains programs such as GAP and BESTFIT
which can be used with default parameters to determine sequence homology or sequence identity
between closely related polypeptides, such as homologous polypeptides from different species of
organisms or between a wild type protein and a mutein thereof. See, e.g., GCG Version 6.1.
Polypeptide sequences also can be compared using FASTA with default or recommended
parameters; a program in GCG Version 6.1. FASTA (e.g., FASTA2 and FASTA3) provides
alignments and percent sequence identity of the regions of the best overlap between the query and
search sequences (Pearson (2000) supra). Another preferred algorithm when comparing a
sequence of the invention to a database containing a large number of sequences from different
organisms is the computer program BLAST, especially BLASTP or TBLASTN, using default
parameters. (See, e.g., Altschul et al. (1990) J. Mol. Biol. 215: 403 410 and (1997) Nucleic Acids
Res. 25:3389 402).
[0143] In specific embodiments, the antibody or antibody fragment for use in the method of the
invention may be mono-specific, bi-specific, or multi-specific. Multi-specific antibodies may be
specific for different epitopes of one target polypeptide or may contain antigen-binding domains
specific for epitopes of more than one target polypeptide. An exemplary bi-specific antibody format
that can be used in the context of the present invention involves the use of a first immunoglobulin
(Ig) CH3 domain and a second 1g CH3 domain, wherein the first and second Ig CH3 domains differ
from one another by at least one amino acid, and wherein at least one amino acid difference
reduces binding of the bi-specific antibody to Protein A as compared to a bi-specific antibody
lacking the amino acid difference. In one embodiment, the first Ig CH3 domain binds Protein A and
the second Ig CH3 domain contains a mutation that reduces or abolishes Protein A binding such as
an H95R modification (by IMGT exon numbering; H435R by EU numbering). The second CH3 may
further comprise an Y96F modification (by IMGT; Y436F by EU). Further modifications that may be
found within the second CH3 include: D16E, L18M, N44S, K52N, V57M, and V821 (by IMGT;
D356E, L358M, N384S, K392N, V397M, and V4221 by EU) in the case of IgG1 mAbs; N44S, K52N,

      WO 2013/166236                                                           PCT/US2013/039192
and V821 (IMGT; N384S, K392N, and V4221 by EU) in the case of IgG2 mAbs; and Q15R, N44S,
K52N, V57M, R69K, E79Q, and V821 (by IMGT; Q355R, N384S, K392N, V397M, R409K, E419Q,
and V4221 by EU) in the case of IgG4 mAbs. Variations on the bi-specific antibody format
described above are contemplated within the scope of the present invention.
[0144] By the phrase "therapeutically effective amount" is meant an amount that produces the
desired effect for which it is administered. The exact amount will depend on the purpose of the
treatment, and will be ascertainable by one skilled in the art using known techniques (see, for
example, Lloyd (1999) The Art, Science and Technology of Pharmaceutical Compounding).
[0145] The antibodies of the invention may be used to "desensitize" a cat-sensitive individual. The
term to "desensitize" is defined herein as to decrease the allergic-reactivity of a cat-sensitive
individual to exposure to cats, cat dander or products thereof, e.g. Fel dl (to a level less than that
which the cat-sensitive individual would otherwise experience).
General Description
[0146] The domestic cat is a source of many indoor allergens and the severity of the symptoms in
individuals who demonstrate a sensitivity to cat allergens ranges from a relatively mild rhinitis and
conjunctivitis to a potentially life-threatening asthmatic condition (Lau, S. et al. (2000), Lancet
356:1392-1397). While patients who demonstrate such a sensitivity to cats appear to be responsive
to different molecules found in cat dander and pelts, the major allergen appears to be Fel dl (Felis
domesticus allergen 1). It has been shown that greater than 80% of patients who are allergic to
cats have IgE antibodies to this allergen (van Ree, R. et al. (1999), J. Allergy Clin. Immunol
104:1223-1230).
[0147] The Fel dl protein is an approximately 18 kDa heterodimeric acidic glycoprotein that
contains about 10-20% of N-linked carbohydrates. Each heterodimer comprises two polypeptide
chains that are encoded by two separate genes (Duffort, OA, et al., (1991), Mol. Immunol. 28:301
309; Morgenstern, JP, et al., (1991), PNAS 88:9690-9694; Griffith, .J., et al. (1992), Gene
113:263-268). Chain 1 comprises about 70 amino acid residues and chain 2 comprises about 90
92 amino acid residues. Three interchain disulfide bonds linking the two chains in natural Fel dl
have been proposed (Kristensen, A.K. et al. (1997), Biol. Chem. 378:899-908) and confirmed for
recombinant Fel dl in the crystal structure (Kaiser, L. et al. (2003), J. Biol. Chem. 278:37730
37735; Kaiser, L. et al., (2007), J. Mol. Biol. 370:714-727). Although each chain is sometimes
individually referred to as "Fel d 1", both chains are needed for the full protein allergen.
[0148] Fel dl is produced by sebaceous glands, squamous glands and squamous epithelial cells
and is transferred to the pelt by licking and grooming (Bartholome, K. et al. (1985), J. Allergy Clin.
Immunol. 76:503-506; Charpin, C. et al. (1991), J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 88:77-82; Dabrowski, A.J.

to be the skin and the fur (Mata, P. et al. (1992), Ann. Allergy 69(4):321-322).
[0149] The Fel dl protein is of an unknown function to the animal but causes an IgG or IgE
reaction in sensitive humans (either as an allergic or asthmatic response). Although other cat
allergens are known, including Fel d2 (albumin) and Fel d3 (cystatin), 60% to 90% of the anti-cat
IgE produced is directed against Fel d1 (Leitermann, K. et al., (1984), J Allergy Clin. Immunol.
74:147-153; Lowenstein, H. et al., (1985), Allergy 40:430-441; van Ree, R. et al., (1999), J. Allergy
Clin. Immunol. 104:1223-1230; Ichikawa, K. et al., (2011), Clin. Exp. Allergy, 31:1279-1286).
[0150] Immunoglobulin E (IgE) is responsible for type 1 hypersensitivity, which manifests itself in
allergic rhinitis, allergic conjunctivitis, hay fever, allergic asthma, bee venom allergy, and food
allergies. IgE circulates in the blood and binds to high-affinity Fc receptors for IgE on basophils and
mast cells. In most allergic responses, the allergens enter the body through inhalation, ingestion,
or through the skin. The allergen then binds to preformed IgE already bound to the high affinity
receptor on the surfaces of mast cells and basophils, resulting in cross-linking of several IgE
molecules and triggering the release of histamine and other inflammatory mediators causing the
various allergic symptoms.
[0151] The treatment for cat allergies includes desensitization therapy, which involves repeated
injections with increasing dosages of either a crude cat dander extract, or short peptides derived
from Fel dl. Using the crude extract of cat dander, Lilja et. al. demonstrated that after three years
of such treatment, patients allergic to cats still exhibited systemic symptoms (Lilja, Q. et al. (1989),
J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 83:37-44 and Hedlin, et al. (1991), J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 87:955-964).
Using short peptides derived from Fel dl for desensitization resulted in a non-significant difference
between the peptide group and the placebo control group (Oldfield, W.L. et al., (2002), Lancet,
360:47-53). Efficacy was only observed when large amounts (750 ug) of the short peptide were
administered to patients (Norman, P.S. et al. (1996), Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 154:1623
1628). Furthermore, asthmatic reactions have been reported in patients given both crude extracts
from cat dander, as well as in patients given short Fel dl peptide treatment. Accordingly, there is a
need in the field of cat allergy treatment for alternative strategies for treating patients sensitive to
cat allergens, in particular Fel dl.
[0152] Antibodies have been proposed as a general treatment strategy for allergies, since they
may be able to block the entry of allergenic molecules into the mucosal tissues, or may bind the
allergen before it has the opportunity to bind to the IgE bound to the high affinity receptor on mast
cells or basophils, thus preventing the release of histamine and other inflammatory mediators from
these cells. U.S. patent number 5,670,626 describes the use of monoclonal antibodies for the
treatment of IgE-mediated allergic diseases such as allergic rhinitis, allergic asthma, and allergic
                                                       29

conjunctivitis by blocking the binding of allergens to the mucosal tissue. U.S. patent number
6,849,259 describes the use of allergen-specific antibodies to inhibit allergic inflammation in an in
vivo mouse model of allergy. Milk-based and egg-based antibody systems have been described.
For example, US20030003133A1 discloses using milk as a carrier for allergens for inducing oral
tolerance to cat dander and other allergens. Compositions and methods for reducing an allergic
response in an animal to an allergen in the environment through use of a molecule that inhibits the
ability of the allergen to bind to mast cells was described in US2010/0143266.        Other antibodies to
Fel dl were described by de Groot et. al. (de Groot et. al., (1988), J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 82:778
786).
[0153] The fully human antibodies described herein demonstrate specific binding to Fel dl and
may be useful for treating patients suffering from cat allergies, in particular, in patients who
demonstrate sensitivity to the Fel dl allergen. The use of such antibodies may be an effective
means of treating patients suffering from allergies to cat dander, or they may be used to prevent a
heightened response to Fel dl upon secondary exposure, or the accompanying symptoms
associated with the allergy, or may be used to lessen the severity and/or the duration of the allergic
response associated with a primary exposure to a cat harboring the Fel dl allergen or with the
recurrence of the symptoms upon secondary exposure. They may be used alone or as adjunct
therapy with other therapeutic moieties or modalities known in the art for treating such allergies,
such as, but not limited to, treatment with corticosteroids or epinephrine. They may be used in
conjunction with a second or third different antibody specific for Fel dl. They may be used with
allergen-specific immunotherapy (SIT).
[0154] In certain embodiments, the antibodies of the invention are obtained from mice immunized
with a primary immunogen, such as natural Fel dl, which may be purchased commercially (See, for
example, Indoor Biotech, #NA-FD1-2), or may be produced recombinantly. In certain
embodiments, the immunogen may be either chain 1 of Fel dl, or chain 2 of Fel dl, or may be a
combination of both chain 1 and chain 2 administered sequentially, or concurrently. The full-length
amino acid sequence of chain 1 (also referred to as FELD1 A) is shown as SEQ ID NO: 392. Full
length amino acid sequences for chain 1 may also be found in GenBank accession numbers
P30438 and NP_001041618.1. The full-length amino acid sequence of chain 2 (also referred to as
FELD1 B) is shown as SEQ ID NO: 393. Full-length amino acid sequences for chain 2 may also be
found in GenBank accession numbers PP30440 and NP_001041619.1.
[0155] In certain embodiments, the recombinantly produced Fel dl immunogen may be made by
direct fusion of the two chains of Fel dl, as described in Kaiser et. al., to produce a fusion product
that has a similar refolding pattern to that of natural Fel dl (Kaiser, L. et al., (2003), J. Biol. Chem.
278(39):37730-37735). In certain embodiments, the immunogen may be a fusion protein such as
that shown in the constructs of SEQ ID NOs: 385, 394, 395, 396 or 397, followed by immunization
                                                    30

with a secondary immunogen, or with an immunogenically active fragment of the natural or
recombinantly produced Fel dl.
[0156] The immunogen may be a biologically active and/or immunogenic fragment of natural or
recombinantly produced Fel dl, or DNA encoding the active fragment thereof. The fragment may
be derived from either the N-terminal or C-terminal of either chain 1 or chain 2, or from the N
terminal or the C terminal of both chain 1 and chain 2. Fragments may be obtained from any site
within chain 1 or chain 2 to be used as an immunogen for preparing antibodies to Fel dl.
[0157] In certain embodiments, the immunogen may be a fusion protein comprising any one or
more of the following: i) amino acid residues 18-109 of chain 2 of Fel dl (See GenBank accession
number P30440 and also SEQ ID NO: 393) fused via the C terminus directly with the N terminus of
amino acid residues 23-92 of chain 1 of Fel dl (See GenBank accession number P30438 and also
SEQ ID NO: 392); ii) amino acid residues 23-92 of chain 1 of Fel dl (See GenBank accession
number P30438 and also SEQ ID NO: 392) fused via the C terminus to the N terminus of amino
acid residues 18-109 of chain 2 of Fel dl (See GenBank accession number P30440 and also SEQ
 ID NO: 393); iii) amino acid residues 18-109 of chain 2 of Fel dl (See GenBank accession number
 NP_001041619.1) fused via the C terminus directly with the N terminus of amino acid residues 19
88 of chain 1 of Fel dl (See GenBank accession number NP_001041618.1), such as the construct
shown in SEQ ID NO: 394 or 396; iv) amino acid residues 19-88 of chain 1 of Fel dl (See GenBank
accession number NP_001041618.1) fused via the C terminus to the N terminus of amino acid
residues 18-109 of chain 2 of Fel dl (See GenBank accession number NP_001041619.1). See
also SEQ ID NO: 395. In certain embodiments, the fusion protein may have a tag at the C terminal
end of the construct, such as a myc-myc-hexahistidine tag (See SEQ ID NOs: 385, 396 or 397 for
such constructs.). In related embodiments, the fusion protein may have a mouse antibody Fc
region coupled at the C terminal end of the construct (See SEQ ID NOs: 394 or 395 for such
constructs.). In certain embodiments, chains 1 and 2 are coupled via a linker known to those skilled
in the art, e.g. (G4 S) 3 (See SEQ ID NOs: 395 and 397 for such a construct.).
[0158] In certain embodiments, antibodies that bind specifically to Fel dl may be prepared using
fragments of the above-noted regions, or peptides that extend beyond the designated regions by
about 5 to about 20 amino acid residues from either, or both, the N or C terminal ends of the
regions described herein. In certain embodiments, any combination of the above-noted regions or
fragments thereof may be used in the preparation Fel dl specific antibodies. In certain
embodiments, any one or more of the above-noted regions of Fel d1, or fragments thereof may be
used for preparing monospecific, bispecific, or multispecific antibodies.
Antigen-Binding Fragments of Antibodies
[0159] Unless specifically indicated otherwise, the term "antibody," as used herein, shall be

understood to encompass antibody molecules comprising two immunoglobulin heavy chains and
two immunoglobulin light chains (i.e., "full antibody molecules") as well as antigen-binding
fragments thereof. The terms "antigen-binding portion" of an antibody, "antigen-binding fragment"
of an antibody, and the like, as used herein, include any naturally occurring, enzymatically
obtainable, synthetic, or genetically engineered polypeptide or glycoprotein that specifically binds
an antigen to form a complex. The terms "antigen-binding portion" of an antibody, or "antibody
fragment", as used herein, refers to one or more fragments of an antibody that retain the ability to
specifically bind to either chain 1 and/or chain 2 of Fel dl. An antibody fragment may include a Fab
fragment, a F(ab') 2 fragment, a Fv fragment, a dAb fragment, a fragment containing a CDR, or an
isolated CDR. Antigen-binding fragments of an antibody may be derived, e.g., from full antibody
molecules using any suitable standard techniques such as proteolytic digestion or recombinant
genetic engineering techniques involving the manipulation and expression of DNA encoding
antibody variable and (optionally) constant domains. Such DNA is known and/or is readily
available from, e.g., commercial sources, DNA libraries (including, e.g., phage-antibody libraries),
or can be synthesized. The DNA may be sequenced and manipulated chemically or by using
molecular biology techniques, for example, to arrange one or more variable and/or constant
domains into a suitable configuration, or to introduce codons, create cysteine residues, modify, add
or delete amino acids, etc.
[0160] Non-limiting examples of antigen-binding fragments include: (i) Fab fragments; (ii) F(ab')2
fragments; (iii) Fd fragments; (iv) Fv fragments; (v) single-chain Fv (scFv) molecules; (vi) dAb
fragments; and (vii) minimal recognition units consisting of the amino acid residues that mimic the
 hypervariable region of an antibody (e.g., an isolated complementarity determining region (CDR)
such as a CDR3 peptide), or a constrained FR3-CDR3-FR4 peptide. Other engineered molecules,
such as domain-specific antibodies, single domain antibodies, domain-deleted antibodies, chimeric
 antibodies, CDR-grafted antibodies, diabodies, triabodies, tetrabodies, minibodies, nanobodies
 (e.g. monovalent nanobodies, bivalent nanobodies, etc.), small modular immunopharmaceuticals
(SMIPs), and shark variable IgNAR domains, are also encompassed within the expression
"antigen-binding fragment," as used herein.
[0161] An antigen-binding fragment of an antibody will typically comprise at least one variable
domain. The variable domain may be of any size or amino acid composition and will generally
comprise at least one CDR, which is adjacent to or in frame with one or more framework
sequences. In antigen-binding fragments having a      VH  domain associated with a VL domain, the VH
and VL domains may be situated relative to one another in any suitable arrangement. For example,
the variable region may be dimeric and contain VH - VH, VH - VL or VL - VL dimers. Alternatively, the
antigen-binding fragment of an antibody may contain a monomeric       VH or VL domain.

configuration of variable and constant domains, including any of the exemplary configurations listed
above, the variable and constant domains may be either directly linked to one another or may be
linked by a full or partial hinge or linker region. A hinge region may consist of at least 2 (e.g., 5, 10,
15, 20, 40, 60 or more) amino acids, which result in a flexible or semi-flexible linkage between
adjacent variable and/or constant domains in a single polypeptide molecule. Moreover, an antigen
binding fragment of an antibody of the present invention may comprise a homo-dimer or hetero
dimer (or other multimer) of any of the variable and constant domain configurations listed above in
non-covalent association with one another and/or with one or more monomeric VH or VL domain
(e.g., by disulfide bond(s)).
[0163] As with full antibody molecules, antigen-binding fragments may be mono-specific or multi
specific (e.g., bi-specific). A multi-specific antigen-binding fragment of an antibody will typically
comprise at least two different variable domains, wherein each variable domain is capable of
specifically binding to a separate antigen or to a different epitope on the same antigen. Any multi
specific antibody format, including the exemplary bi-specific antibody formats disclosed herein, may
be adapted for use in the context of an antigen-binding fragment of an antibody of the present
invention using routine techniques available in the art.
Preparation of Human Antibodies
[0164] Methods for generating human antibodies in transgenic mice are known in the art. Any
such known methods can be used in the context of the present invention to make human
antibodies that specifically bind to Fel dl.
[0165] Using VELOCIMMUNE              TM
                                          technology (see, for example, US 6,596,541, Regeneron
Pharmaceuticals, VELOCIMMUNE@) or any other known method for generating monoclonal
antibodies, high affinity chimeric antibodies to Fel dl are initially isolated having a human variable
region and a mouse constant region. The VELOCIMMUNE@ technology involves generation of a
transgenic mouse having a genome comprising human heavy and light chain variable regions
operably linked to endogenous mouse constant region loci such that the mouse produces an
antibody comprising a human variable region and a mouse constant region in response to antigenic
stimulation. The DNA encoding the variable regions of the heavy and light chains of the antibody
are isolated and operably linked to DNA encoding the human heavy and light chain constant
                                                                33

      WO 2013/166236                                                             PCT/US2013/039192
regions. The DNA is then expressed in a cell capable of expressing the fully human antibody.
[0166] Generally, a VELOCIMMUNE@ mouse is challenged with the antigen of interest, and
lymphatic cells (such as B-cells) are recovered from the mice that express antibodies. The
lymphatic cells may be fused with a myeloma cell line to prepare immortal hybridoma cell lines, and
such hybridoma cell lines are screened and selected to identify hybridoma cell lines that produce
antibodies specific to the antigen of interest. DNA encoding the variable regions of the heavy chain
and light chain may be isolated and linked to desirable isotypic constant regions of the heavy chain
and light chain. Such an antibody protein may be produced in a cell, such as a CHO cell.
Alternatively, DNA encoding the antigen-specific chimeric antibodies or the variable domains of the
light and heavy chains may be isolated directly from antigen-specific lymphocytes.
[0167] Initially, high affinity chimeric antibodies are isolated having a human variable region and a
mouse constant region. As in the experimental section below, the antibodies are characterized and
selected for desirable characteristics, including affinity, selectivity, epitope, etc. The mouse
constant regions are replaced with a desired human constant region to generate the fully human
antibody of the invention, for example wild-type or modified IgG1 or IgG4. While the constant
region selected may vary according to specific use, high affinity antigen-binding and target
specificity characteristics reside in the variable region.
[0168] In general, the antibodies of the instant invention possess very high affinities, typically
possessing   KD   of from about  1012 through about 10-9 M, when measured by binding to antigen
either immobilized on solid phase or in solution phase. The mouse constant regions are replaced
with desired human constant regions to generate the fully human antibodies of the invention. While
the constant region selected may vary according to specific use, high affinity antigen-binding and
target specificity characteristics reside in the variable region.
Bioequivalents
[0169] The anti-Fel d1 antibodies and antibody fragments of the present invention encompass
proteins having amino acid sequences that vary from those of the described antibodies, but that
retain the ability to bind Fel dl. Such variant antibodies and antibody fragments comprise one or
more additions, deletions, or substitutions of amino acids when compared to parent sequence, but
exhibit biological activity that is essentially equivalent to that of the described antibodies. Likewise,
the antibody-encoding DNA sequences of the present invention encompass sequences that
comprise one or more additions, deletions, or substitutions of nucleotides when compared to the
disclosed sequence, but that encode an antibody or antibody fragment that is essentially
bioequivalent to an antibody or antibody fragment of the invention.
[0170] Two antigen-binding proteins, or antibodies, are considered bioequivalent if, for example,
they are pharmaceutical equivalents or pharmaceutical alternatives whose rate and extent of
                                                     34

     WO 2013/166236                                                              PCT/US2013/039192
absorption do not show a significant difference when administered at the same molar dose under
similar experimental conditions, either single does or multiple dose. Some antibodies will be
considered equivalents or pharmaceutical alternatives if they are equivalent in the extent of their
absorption but not in their rate of absorption and yet may be considered bioequivalent because
such differences in the rate of absorption are intentional and are reflected in the labeling, are not
essential to the attainment of effective body drug concentrations on, e.g., chronic use, and are
considered medically insignificant for the particular drug product studied.
[0171] In one embodiment, two antigen-binding proteins are bioequivalent if there are no clinically
meaningful differences in their safety, purity, and potency.
[0172] In one embodiment, two antigen-binding proteins are bioequivalent if a patient can be
switched one or more times between the reference product and the biological product without an
expected increase in the risk of adverse effects, including a clinically significant change in
immunogenicity, or diminished effectiveness, as compared to continued therapy without such
switching.
[0173] In one embodiment, two antigen-binding proteins are bioequivalent if they both act by a
common mechanism or mechanisms of action for the condition or conditions of use, to the extent
that such mechanisms are known.
[0174] Bioequivalence may be demonstrated by in vivo and/or in vitro methods. Bioequivalence
measures include, e.g., (a) an in vivo test in humans or other mammals, in which the concentration
of the antibody or its metabolites is measured in blood, plasma, serum, or other biological fluid as a
function of time; (b) an in vitro test that has been correlated with and is reasonably predictive of
human in vivo bioavailability data; (c) an in vivo test in humans or other mammals in which the
appropriate acute pharmacological effect of the antibody (or its target) is measured as a function of
time; and (d) in a well-controlled clinical trial that establishes safety, efficacy, or bioavailability or
bioequivalence of an antibody.
[0175] Bioequivalent variants of the antibodies of the invention may be constructed by, for
example, making various substitutions of residues or sequences or deleting terminal or internal
residues or sequences not needed for biological activity. For example, cysteine residues not
essential for biological activity can be deleted or replaced with other amino acids to prevent
formation of unnecessary or incorrect intramolecular disulfide bridges upon renaturation. In other
contexts, bioequivalent antibodies may include antibody variants comprising amino acid changes,
which modify the glycosylation characteristics of the antibodies, e.g., mutations that eliminate or
remove glycosylation.
Biological Characteristics of the Antibodies
[0176] In general, the antibodies of the present invention may function by binding to either chain 1

or to chain 2 of Fel dl, or to both chain 1 and chain 2 of Fel dl or to a fragment of either chain 1 or
chain 2.
[0177] In certain embodiments, the antibodies of the present invention may bind to an epitope
located in at least the C-terminal region of either chain 1 or chain 2 of Fel dl. In one embodiment,
the antibodies may bind to an epitope within the N-terminal region of either chain 1 or chain 2 of Fel
dl.
[0178] In certain embodiments, the antibodies of the present invention may function by blocking or
inhibiting the binding of IgE to mast cells or basophils in a patient sensitive to the fel dl allergen.
[0179] In certain embodiments, the antibodies of the present invention may function by binding to
any other region or fragment of the full length chain 1 or chain 2 of the natural Fel d1 protein, the
amino acid sequence of which is shown in SEQ ID NO: 392 (chain 1) and SEQ ID NO: 393 (chain
2).
[0180] In certain embodiments, the antibodies of the present invention may be bi-specific

also bind one epitope in chain 2. In certain embodiments, the bi-specific antibodies of the invention
may bind two different epitopes in chain 1. In certain embodiments, the bi-specific antibodies of the
invention may bind two different epitopes in chain 2. In certain embodiments, the bi-specific
antibodies of the invention may bind to two different sites within the same helix on either one of
chain 1 or chain 2, or may bind to the same helix on both chain 1 and chain 2. The structure of Fel
dl is described in greater detail in Kaiser et. al. (Kaiser, L. et. al. (2003), J. Biol. Chem. 278
(39):37730-37735), whereby the authors note that Fel dl consists of eight helices, H1-H4 and H5
H8, which correspond to chains 2 and 1, respectively, in natural Fel dl.

(vii) blocks dye extravasation in vivo in a passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA) mouse model using
Fel dl specific mouse IgE; or (viii) when combined with a second antibody or antigen binding
fragment thereof of the invention, decreases the frequency of mucous secreting cells in the lungs of
Fel dl challenged animals.
[0183] Certain Fel dl antibodies of the present invention, when used alone, or in combination, are
able to bind to and neutralize at least one biological effect of Fel dl, as determined by in vitro or in
vivo assays. The ability of the antibodies of the invention to bind to and neutralize the activity of Fel
dl may be measured using any standard method known to those skilled in the art, including binding
assays, or neutralization of activity (e.g., protection from anaphylaxis) assays, as described herein.
[0184] Non-limiting, exemplary in vitro assays for measuring binding activity are illustrated in
Examples 4, herein. In Examples 4, the binding affinities and kinetic constants of human anti-Fel
dl antibodies were determined by surface plasmon resonance and the measurements were
conducted on a T200 Biacore instrument.
[0185] The Fel dl proteins or peptides may be modified to include addition or substitution of certain
residues for tagging or for purposes of conjugation to carrier molecules, such as, KLH. For
example, a cysteine may be added at either the N terminal or C terminal end of a peptide, or a
linker sequence may be added to prepare the peptide for conjugation to, for example, KLH for
                                                     38

      WO 2013/166236                                                           PCT/US2013/039192
immunization. The antibodies specific for Fel dl may contain no additional labels or moieties, or
they may contain an N-terminal or C-terminal label or moiety. In one embodiment, the label or
moiety is biotin. In a binding assay, the location of a label (if any) may determine the orientation of
the peptide relative to the surface upon which the peptide is bound. For example, if a surface is
coated with avidin, a peptide containing an N-terminal biotin will be oriented such that the C
terminal portion of the peptide will be distal to the surface.
Epitope Mapping and Related Technologies
[0186] The term "epitope," as used herein, refers to an antigenic determinant that interacts with a
specific antigen binding site in the variable region of an antibody molecule known as a paratope. A
single antigen may have more than one epitope. Thus, different antibodies may bind to different
areas on an antigen and may have different biological effects. Epitopes may be either
conformational or linear. A conformational epitope is produced by spatially juxtaposed amino acids
from different segments of the linear polypeptide chain. A linear epitope is one produced by
adjacent amino acid residues in a polypeptide chain. In certain circumstance, an epitope may
include moieties of saccharides, phosphoryl groups, or sulfonyl groups on the antigen.
[0187] The present invention includes anti-Fel dl antibodies which interact with one or more amino
acids found within one or more regions of chain 1 or chain 2 of the Fel dl molecule including, e.g.,
chain 1 (chain A) as shown in SEQ ID NO: 392, or chain 2 (chain B) as shown in SEQ ID NO: 393,
or within comparable regions of a recombinantly produced Fel d1 protein, as shown in any one of
SEQ ID NOs: 385, 394, 395, 396 or 397. The epitope to which the antibodies bind may consist of a
single contiguous sequence of 3 or more (e.g., 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18,
 19, 20 or more) amino acids located within any of the aforementioned regions or segments of the
 Fel dl molecule (e.g. a linear epitope in either chain 1 or chain 2, or in a region that spans both
chain 1 and chain 2). Alternatively, the epitope may consist of a plurality of non-contiguous amino
acids (or amino acid sequences) located within either or both of the aforementioned regions or
segments of the Fel dl molecule (e.g. a conformational epitope).
[0188] Various techniques known to persons of ordinary skill in the art can be used to determine
whether an antibody "interacts with one or more amino acids" within a polypeptide or protein.
 Exemplary techniques include, for example, routine cross-blocking assays, such as that described
in Antibodies, Harlow and Lane (Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harb., NY). Other
methods include alanine scanning mutational analysis, peptide blot analysis (Reineke (2004)
 Methods Mol Biol 248:443-63), peptide cleavage analysis crystallographic studies and NMR
analysis. In addition, methods such as epitope excision, epitope extraction and chemical
modification of antigens can be employed (Tomer (2000) Protein Science 9: 487-496). Another
method that can be used to identify the amino acids within a polypeptide with which an antibody
                                                     39

      WO 2013/166236                                                         PCT/US2013/039192
interacts is hydrogen/deuterium exchange detected by mass spectrometry. In general terms, the
hydrogen/deuterium exchange method involves deuterium-labeling the protein of interest, followed
by binding the antibody to the deuterium-labeled protein. Next, the protein/antibody complex is
transferred to water and exchangeable protons within amino acids that are protected by the
antibody complex undergo deuterium-to-hydrogen back-exchange at a slower rate than
exchangeable protons within amino acids that are not part of the interface. As a result, amino acids
that form part of the protein/antibody interface may retain deuterium and therefore exhibit relatively
higher mass compared to amino acids not included in the interface. After dissociation of the
antibody, the target protein is subjected to protease cleavage and mass spectrometry analysis,
thereby revealing the deuterium-labeled residues which correspond to the specific amino acids with
which the antibody interacts. See, e.g., Ehring (1999) Analytical Biochemistry 267(2):252-259;
Engen and Smith (2001) Anal. Chem. 73:256A-265A. X-ray crystallography of the antigen/antibody
complex may also be used for epitope mapping purposes.
[0189] Modification-Assisted Profiling (MAP), also known as Antigen Structure-based Antibody
Profiling (ASAP) is a method that categorizes large numbers of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs)
directed against the same antigen according to the similarities of the binding profile of each
antibody to chemically or enzymatically modified antigen surfaces (US 2004/0101920). Each
category may reflect a unique epitope either distinctly different from or partially overlapping with
epitope represented by another category. This technology allows rapid filtering of genetically
identical antibodies, such that characterization can be focused on genetically distinct antibodies.
When applied to hybridoma screening, MAP may facilitate identification of rare hybridoma clones
that produce mAbs having the desired characteristics. MAP may be used to sort the antibodies of
the invention into groups of antibodies binding different epitopes.
[0190] In certain embodiments, the anti-Fel dl antibodies or antigen-binding fragments thereof
bind an epitope within any one or more of the regions exemplified in chain 1 or chain 2 of Fel dl,
either in natural form, as exemplified in SEQ ID NO: 392 (chain 1) and SEQ ID NO: 393 (chain 2),
or recombinantly produced, as exemplified in any of SEQ ID NOS: 385, 394, 395, 396, and 397, or
to a fragment thereof. In certain embodiments, the antibodies of the invention, as shown in Table
1, interact with at least one amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of amino acid
residues ranging from about position 15 to about position 24 of SEQ ID NO: 396; amino acid
residues ranging from about position 85 to about position 103 of SEQ ID NO: 396; amino acid
residues ranging from about position 85 to about position 104 of SEQ ID NO: 396; amino acid
residues ranging from about position 113 to about position 116 of SEQ ID NO: 396. These regions
are further exemplified in SEQ ID NOs: 402, 403, 404, 412 and 426.
[0191] The present invention also includes anti-Fel dl antibodies that bind to the same epitope, or
a portion of the epitope, as any of the specific exemplary antibodies described herein in Table 1, or
                                                   40

      WO 2013/166236                                                          PCT/US2013/039192
an antibody having the CDR sequences of any of the exemplary antibodies described in Table 1.
 Likewise, the present invention also includes anti-Fel dl antibodies that compete for binding to Fel
dl or a Fel dl fragment with any of the specific exemplary antibodies described herein in Table 1,
or an antibody having the CDR sequences of any of the exemplary antibodies described in Table 1.
[0192] One can easily determine whether an antibody binds to the same epitope as, or competes
for binding with, a reference anti-Fel dl antibody by using routine methods known in the art. For
example, to determine if a test antibody binds to the same epitope as a reference anti-Fel dl
antibody of the invention, the reference antibody is allowed to bind to a Fel dl protein or peptide
under saturating conditions. Next, the ability of a test antibody to bind to the Fel dl molecule is
assessed. If the test antibody is able to bind to Fel dl following saturation binding with the
reference anti-Fel dl antibody, it can be concluded that the test antibody binds to a different
epitope than the reference anti-Fel dl antibody. On the other hand, if the test antibody is not able
to bind to the Fel dl molecule following saturation binding with the reference anti-Fel dl antibody,
then the test antibody may bind to the same epitope as the epitope bound by the reference anti-Fel
dl antibody of the invention.
[0193] To determine if an antibody competes for binding with a reference anti- Fel dl antibody, the
above-described binding methodology is performed in two orientations: In a first orientation, the
reference antibody is allowed to bind to a Fel dl molecule under saturating conditions followed by
assessment of binding of the test antibody to the Fel dl molecule. In a second orientation, the test
antibody is allowed to bind to a Fel dl molecule under saturating conditions followed by
assessment of binding of the reference antibody to the Fel dl molecule. If, in both orientations,
only the first (saturating) antibody is capable of binding to the Fel dl molecule, then it is concluded
that the test antibody and the reference antibody compete for binding to Fel dl. As will be
appreciated by a person of ordinary skill in the art, an antibody that competes for binding with a
reference antibody may not necessarily bind to the identical epitope as the reference antibody, but
may sterically block binding of the reference antibody by binding an overlapping or adjacent
epitope.
[0194] Two antibodies bind to the same or overlapping epitope if each competitively inhibits
(blocks) binding of the other to the antigen. That is, a 1-, 5-, 10-, 20- or 100-fold excess of one
antibody inhibits binding of the other by at least 50% but preferably 75%, 90% or even 99% as
measured in a competitive binding assay (see, e.g., Junghans et al., Cancer Res. 1990 50:1495
1502). Alternatively, two antibodies have the same epitope if essentially all amino acid mutations in
the antigen that reduce or eliminate binding of one antibody reduce or eliminate binding of the
other. Two antibodies have overlapping epitopes if some amino acid mutations that reduce or
eliminate binding of one antibody reduce or eliminate binding of the other.
[0195] Additional routine experimentation (e.g., peptide mutation and binding analyses) can then
                                                    41

      WO 2013/166236                                                           PCT/US2013/039192
be carried out to confirm whether the observed lack of binding of the test antibody is in fact due to
binding to the same epitope as the reference antibody or if steric blocking (or another
phenomenon) is responsible for the lack of observed binding. Experiments of this sort can be
performed using ELISA, RIA, surface plasmon resonance, flow cytometry or any other quantitative
or qualitative antibody-binding assay available in the art.
Immunoconjugates
[0196] The invention encompasses a human anti-Fel dl monoclonal antibody conjugated to a
therapeutic moiety ("immunoconjugate"), such as an agent that is capable of reducing the severity
of an allergic response to the Fel dl allergen present in cat dander or on cats, or in an area of the
environment where cats may reside, or to ameliorate at least one symptom associated with
exposure to cats, cat dander or to the Fel dl allergen, including rhinitis, conjunctivitis, or breathing
difficulties, or the severity thereof. Such an agent may be a corticosteroid, a second different
antibody to Fel dl, or a vaccine. The type of therapeutic moiety that may be conjugated to the Fel
dl antibody will take into account the condition to be treated and the desired therapeutic effect to
be achieved. Alternatively, if the desired therapeutic effect is to treat the sequelae or symptoms
associated with exposure to the Fel dl allergen, or any other condition resulting from such
exposure, such as, but not limited to, rhinitis or conjunctivitis, it may be advantageous to conjugate
an agent appropriate to treat the sequelae or symptoms of the condition, or to alleviate any side
effects of the antibodies of the invention. Examples of suitable agents for forming
immunoconjugates are known in the art, see for example, WO 05/103081.
Multi-specific Antibodies
[0197] The antibodies of the present invention may be mono-specific, bi-specific, or multi-specific.
Multi-specific antibodies may be specific for different epitopes of one target polypeptide or may
contain antigen-binding domains specific for more than one target polypeptide. See, e.g., Tutt et al.,
1991, J. Immunol. 147:60-69; Kufer et al., 2004, Trends Biotechnol. 22:238-244. The antibodies of
the present invention can be linked to or co-expressed with another functional molecule, e.g.,
another peptide or protein. For example, an antibody or fragment thereof can be functionally linked
(e.g., by chemical coupling, genetic fusion, noncovalent association or otherwise) to one or more
other molecular entities, such as another antibody or antibody fragment to produce a bi-specific or
a multi-specific antibody with a second binding specificity. For example, the present invention
includes bi-specific antibodies wherein one arm of an immunoglobulin may be specific for chain 1 of
Fel dl, or a fragment thereof, and the other arm of the immunoglobulin may be specific for chain 2
of Fel dl, or a second therapeutic target, or may be conjugated to a therapeutic moiety.

     WO 2013/166236                                                         PCT/US2013/039192
[0198] Certain exemplary embodiments of the present invention include a bi-specific antigen
binding molecule, which is a bi-specific antibody. Each antigen-binding domain of a bi-specific
antibody comprises a heavy chain variable domain (HCVR) and a light chain variable domain
(LCVR). The HCVR may also be referred to as a       VH  region, and the LCVR may also be referred to
as a VL region. Typically, each HCVR and LCVR comprises three CDRs interspersed with four
FRs, arranged from amino-terminus to carboxy-terminus in the following order: FR1, CDR1, FR2,
CDR2, FR3, CDR3, FR4. The three CDRs within an HCVR may be referred to herein as HCDR1,
HCDR2 and HCDR3; while the three CDRs within an LCVR may be referred to herein as LCDR1,
LCDR2 and LCDR3.
[0199] In the bi-specific antigen-binding molecules of the present invention, each antigen-binding
domain may comprise or consist of a full antibody molecule or an antigen-binding fragment of an
antibody. The terms "antigen-binding portion" of an antibody, "antigen-binding fragment" of an
antibody, and the like, as used herein, include any naturally occurring, enzymatically obtainable,
synthetic, or genetically engineered polypeptide or glycoprotein that specifically binds an antigen to
form a complex. Antigen-binding fragments of an antibody may be derived, e.g., from full antibody
molecules using any suitable standard techniques such as proteolytic digestion or recombinant
genetic engineering techniques involving the manipulation and expression of DNA encoding
antibody variable and optionally constant domains. Such DNA is known and/or is readily available
from, e.g., commercial sources, DNA libraries (including, e.g., phage-antibody libraries), or can be
synthesized. The DNA may be sequenced and manipulated chemically or by using molecular
biology techniques, for example, to arrange one or more variable and/or constant domains into a
suitable configuration, or to introduce codons, create cysteine residues, modify, add or delete
amino acids, etc.
[0200] Non-limiting examples of antigen-binding fragments that may be included in the bi-specific
antigen-binding molecules of the present invention include: (i) Fab fragments; (ii) F(ab')2
fragments; (iii) Fd fragments; (iv) Fv fragments; (v) single-chain Fv (scFv) molecules; (vi) dAb
fragments; and (vii) minimal recognition units consisting of the amino acid residues that mimic the
 hypervariable region of an antibody. Other engineered molecules, such as domain-specific
 antibodies, single domain antibodies, domain-deleted antibodies, chimeric antibodies, CDR
grafted antibodies, diabodies, triabodies, tetrabodies, minibodies, nanobodies (e.g. monovalent
nanobodies, bivalent nanobodies, etc.), small modular immunopharmaceuticals (SMIPs), and
 shark variable IgNAR domains, are also encompassed within the expression "antigen-binding
fragment," as used herein.
[0201] An antigen-binding fragment of an antibody will typically comprise at least one variable
domain. The variable domain may be of any size or amino acid composition and will generally
comprise at least one CDR, which is adjacent to or in frame with one or more framework
                                                   43

       WO 2013/166236                                                                     PCT/US2013/039192
sequences. In antigen-binding fragments having a VH domain associated with a VL domain, the VH
and VL domains may be situated relative to one another in any suitable arrangement. For example,
the variable region may be dimeric and contain VH-VH, VH-VL or VL-VL dimers. Alternatively, the
antigen-binding fragment of an antibody may contain a monomeric VH or VL domain.
[0202] In certain embodiments, an antigen-binding fragment of a bi-specific antigen-binding
molecule may contain at least one variable domain covalently linked to at least one constant
domain. Non-limiting, exemplary configurations of variable and constant domains that may be
found within an antigen-binding domain of a bi-specific antigen-binding molecule may include: (i)
VH-CH1;    (ii) VH-CH 2 ; (iii) VH-CH 3 ; (iv) VH-CH1-CH 2 ; (v) VH-CH1-CH 2 -CH 3 ; (vi) VH-CH2 -CH 3 ; (vii) VH-CL;
(viii) VL-CH1; (iX)VL-CH 2 ; (X) VL-CH 3 ; (Xi) VL-CH1-CH 2 ; (Xii) VL-CH1-CH 2 -CH 3 ; (Xiii) VL-CH2 -CH 3 ; and
(xiv) VL-CL. In any configuration of variable and constant domains, including any of the exemplary
configurations listed above, the variable and constant domains may be either directly linked to one
another or may be linked by a full or partial hinge or linker region. A hinge region may consist of at
least 2 (e.g., 5, 10, 15, 20, 40, 60 or more) amino acids, which result in a flexible or semi-flexible
linkage between adjacent variable and/or constant domains in a single polypeptide molecule.
Moreover, an antigen-binding domain of a bi-specific antigen-binding molecule may comprise a
homo-dimer or hetero-dimer (or other multimer) of any of the variable and constant domain
configurations listed above in non-covalent association with one another and/or with one or more
monomeric VH or VL domain (e.g., by disulfide bond(s)).
[0203] The first antigen-binding domain and the second antigen-binding domain may be directly or
indirectly connected to one another to form a bi-specific antigen-binding molecule. Alternatively,
the first antigen-binding domain and the second antigen-binding domain may each be connected to
a separate multimerizing domain. The association of one multimerizing domain with another
multimerizing domain facilitates the association between the two antigen-binding domains, thereby
forming a bispecific antigen-binding molecule. As used herein, a "multimerizing domain" is any
macromolecule, protein, polypeptide, peptide, or amino acid that has the ability to associate with a
second multimerizing domain of the same or similar structure or constitution. For example, a
multimerizing domain may be a polypeptide comprising an immunoglobulin CH3 domain. A non
limiting example of a multimerizing component is an Fc portion of an immunoglobulin, e.g., an Fc
domain of an IgG selected from the isotypes IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4, as well as any allotype
within each isotype group. In certain embodiments, the multimerizing domain may be an Fc
fragment or an amino acid sequence of 1 to about 200 amino acids in length containing at least one
cysteine residues. In other embodiments, the multimerizing domain may be a cysteine residue, or
a short cysteine-containing peptide. Other multimerizing domains include peptides or polypeptides
comprising or consisting of a leucine zipper, a helix-loop motif, or a coiled-coil motif.
                                                            44

       WO 2013/166236                                                         PCT/US2013/039192
[0204] Any bi-specific antibody format or technology may be used to make the bi-specific antigen
binding molecules of the present invention. For example, an antibody or fragment thereof having a
first antigen binding specificity can be functionally linked (e.g., by chemical coupling, genetic fusion,
noncovalent association or otherwise) to one or more other molecular entities, such as another
antibody or antibody fragment having a second antigen-binding specificity to produce a bi-specific
antigen-binding molecule.
[0205] An exemplary bi-specific antibody format that can be used in the context of the present
invention involves the use of a first immunoglobulin (Ig) CH3 domain and a second 1g CH3 domain,
wherein the first and second Ig CH3 domains differ from one another by at least one amino acid, and
wherein at least one amino acid difference reduces binding of the bi-specific antibody to Protein A
as compared to a bi-specific antibody lacking the amino acid difference. In one embodiment, the
first Ig CH3 domain binds Protein A and the second Ig CH3 domain contains a mutation that reduces
or abolishes Protein A binding such as an H95R modification (by IMGT exon numbering; H435R by
EU numbering). The second CH3 may further comprise a Y96F modification (by IMGT; Y436F by
EU). Further modifications that may be found within the second CH3 include: D1 6E, Li 8M, N44S,
K52N, V57M, and V821 (by IMGT; D356E, L358M, N384S, K392N, V397M, and V4221 by EU) in
the case of IgG1 antibodies; N44S, K52N, and V821 (IMGT; N384S, K392N, and V4221 by EU) in
the case of IgG2 antibodies; and Q15R, N44S, K52N, V57M, R69K, E79Q, and V821 (by IMGT;
Q355R, N384S, K392N, V397M, R409K, E419Q, and V4221 by EU) in the case of IgG4 antibodies.
Variations on the bi-specific antibody format described above are contemplated within the scope of
the present invention.
[0206] Other exemplary bi-specific formats that can be used in the context of the present invention
include, without limitation, e.g., scFv-based or diabody bispecific formats, IgG-scFv fusions, dual
variable domain (DVD)-Ig, Quadroma, knobs-into-holes, common light chain (e.g., common light
chain with knobs-into-holes, etc.), CrossMab, CrossFab, (SEED)body, leucine zipper, Duobody,
IgGl/lgG2, dual acting Fab (DAF)-IgG, and Mab 2 bispecific formats (see, e.g., Klein et al. 2012,
mAbs 4:6, 1-11, and references cited therein, for a review of the foregoing formats). Bi-specific
antibodies can also be constructed using peptide/nucleic acid conjugation, e.g., wherein unnatural
amino acids with orthogonal chemical reactivity are used to generate site-specific antibody
oligonucleotide conjugates which then self-assemble into multimeric complexes with defined
composition, valency and geometry. (See, e.g., Kazane et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. [Epub: Dec. 4,
2012]).
Therapeutic Administration and Formulations
[0207] The invention provides therapeutic compositions comprising the anti-Fel dl antibodies or
antigen-binding fragments thereof of the present invention. The administration of therapeutic

compositions in accordance with the invention will be administered via a suitable route including,
but not limited to, intravenously, subcutaneously, intramuscularly, intranasally, with suitable
carriers, excipients, and other agents that are incorporated into formulations to provide improved
transfer, delivery, tolerance, and the like. A multitude of appropriate formulations can be found in
the formulary known to all pharmaceutical chemists: Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mack
Publishing Company, Easton, PA. These formulations include, for example, powders, pastes,
ointments, jellies, waxes, oils, lipids, lipid (cationic or anionic) containing vesicles (such as
LIPOFECTIN      TM
                   ), DNA conjugates, anhydrous absorption pastes, oil-in-water and water-in-oil
emulsions, emulsions carbowax (polyethylene glycols of various molecular weights), semi-solid
gels, and semi-solid mixtures containing carbowax. See also Powell et al. "Compendium of
excipients for parenteral formulations" PDA (1998) J Pharm Sci Technol 52:238-311.
[0208] The dose of antibody may vary depending upon the age and the size of a subject to be
administered, target disease, conditions, route of administration, and the like. When the antibody
of the present invention is used for treating the rhinitis or conjunctivitis associated with exposure to
a cat, or to cat dander in an individual having a sensitivity to Fel dl, or for preventing an
anaphylactic response to the cat allergen, or for lessening the severity of the allergic response, it is
advantageous to intravenously administer the antibody of the present invention normally at a single
dose of about 0.01 to about 30 mg/kg body weight, more preferably about 0.02 to about 7, about
0.03 to about 5, or about 0.05 to about 3 mg/kg body weight. Depending on the severity of the
condition, the frequency and the duration of the treatment can be adjusted. In certain embodiments,
the antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof of the invention can be administered as an initial
dose of at least about 0.1 mg to about 800 mg, about 1 to about 500 mg, about 5 to about 300 mg,
or about 10 to about 200 mg, to about 100 mg, or to about 50 mg. In certain embodiments, the
initial dose may be followed by administration of a second or a plurality of subsequent doses of the
antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof in an amount that can be approximately the same or
less than that of the initial dose, wherein the subsequent doses are separated by at least 1 day to 3
days; at least one week, at least 2 weeks; at least 3 weeks; at least 4 weeks; at least 5 weeks; at
least 6 weeks; at least 7 weeks; at least 8 weeks; at least 9 weeks; at least 10 weeks; at least 12
weeks; or at least 14 weeks.
[0209] Various delivery systems are known and can be used to administer the pharmaceutical
composition of the invention, e.g., encapsulation in liposomes, microparticles, microcapsules,
recombinant cells capable of expressing the mutant viruses, receptor mediated endocytosis (see,
e.g., Wu et al. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262:4429-4432). Methods of introduction include, but are not
limited to, intradermal, transdermal, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intravenous, subcutaneous,
intranasal, epidural and oral routes. The composition may be administered by any convenient
route, for example by infusion or bolus injection, by absorption through epithelial or mucocutaneous
                                                       46

linings (e.g., oral mucosa, rectal and intestinal mucosa, etc.) and may be administered together
with other biologically active agents. Administration can be systemic or local.
[0210] The pharmaceutical composition can be also delivered in a vesicle, in particular a liposome
(see, for example, Langer (1990) Science 249:1527-1533).
[0211] In certain situations, the pharmaceutical composition can be delivered in a controlled
release system. In one embodiment, a pump may be used. In another embodiment, polymeric
materials can be used. In yet another embodiment, a controlled release system can be placed in
proximity of the composition's target, thus requiring only a fraction of the systemic dose.
[0212] The injectable preparations may include dosage forms for intravenous, subcutaneous,
intracutaneous and intramuscular injections, drip infusions, etc. These injectable preparations may
be prepared by methods publicly known. For example, the injectable preparations may be
prepared, e.g., by dissolving, suspending or emulsifying the antibody or its salt described above in
a sterile aqueous medium or an oily medium conventionally used for injections. As the aqueous
medium for injections, there are, for example, physiological saline, an isotonic solution containing
glucose and other auxiliary agents, etc., which may be used in combination with an appropriate
solubilizing agent such as an alcohol (e.g., ethanol), a polyalcohol (e.g., propylene glycol,
polyethylene glycol), a nonionic surfactant [e.g., polysorbate 80, HCO-50 (polyoxyethylene (50 mol)
adduct of hydrogenated castor oil)], etc. As the oily medium, there are employed, e.g., sesame oil,
soybean oil, etc., which may be used in combination with a solubilizing agent such as benzyl
benzoate, benzyl alcohol, etc. The injection thus prepared is preferably filled in an appropriate
ampoule.
[0213] A pharmaceutical composition of the present invention can be delivered subcutaneously or
intravenously with a standard needle and syringe. In addition, with respect to subcutaneous
delivery, a pen delivery device readily has applications in delivering a pharmaceutical composition
of the present invention. Such a pen delivery device can be reusable or disposable. A reusable
pen delivery device generally utilizes a replaceable cartridge that contains a pharmaceutical
composition. Once all of the pharmaceutical composition within the cartridge has been
administered and the cartridge is empty, the empty cartridge can readily be discarded and replaced
with a new cartridge that contains the pharmaceutical composition. The pen delivery device can
then be reused. In a disposable pen delivery device, there is no replaceable cartridge. Rather, the
disposable pen delivery device comes prefilled with the pharmaceutical composition held in a
reservoir within the device. Once the reservoir is emptied of the pharmaceutical composition, the
entire device is discarded.

subcutaneous delivery of a pharmaceutical composition of the present invention. Examples
include, but certainly are not limited to AUTOPEN   TM

[0215] Advantageously, the pharmaceutical compositions for oral or parenteral use described
above are prepared into dosage forms in a unit dose suited to fit a dose of the active ingredients.
Such dosage forms in a unit dose include, for example, tablets, pills, capsules, injections
(ampoules), suppositories, etc. The amount of the aforesaid antibody contained is generally about
5 to about 500 mg per dosage form in a unit dose; especially in the form of injection, it is preferred
that the aforesaid antibody is contained in about 5 to about 100 mg and in about 10 to about 250
mg for the other dosage forms.
Therapeutic Uses of the Antibodies
[0216] Due to their interaction with Fel dl, the present antibodies are useful for treating the
primary response following exposure of an individual to a cat, cat dander or to an environment
containing the Fel dl protein, or at least one symptom associated with the allergic response, such
as itchy eyes, conjunctivitis, rhinitis, wheezing, breathing difficulties, or for preventing a secondary
response to the Fel d1 allergen, including a more serious anaphylactic response, or for lessening
the severity, duration, and/or frequency of symptoms following reexposure to the cat allergen.
Accordingly, it is envisioned that the antibodies of the present invention may be used
prophylactically or therapeutically.
[0217] In yet a further embodiment of the invention the present antibodies are used for the
preparation of a pharmaceutical composition for treating patients suffering from a sensitivity to cats,
cat dander, cat hair or an extract thereof and/or the Fel dl protein. In yet another embodiment of
the invention the present antibodies are used for the preparation of a pharmaceutical composition
for reducing the severity of primary exposure to Fel d1, or for reducing the severity, duration of,
and/or number of allergic responses to Fel dl. In a further embodiment of the invention the present
antibodies are used as adjunct therapy with any other agent useful for treating cat allergens,
including corticosteroids, vaccines, allergen specific immunotherapy (SIT), or any other palliative
                                                        48

therapy known to those skilled in the art.
Combination Therapies
[0218] Combination therapies may include an anti-Fel dl antibody of the invention and any
additional therapeutic agent that may be advantageously combined with an antibody of the
invention, or with a biologically active fragment of an antibody of the invention.
[0219] For example, a second therapeutic agent may be employed to aid in reducing the allergic
symptoms following exposure to a cat, cat dander, cat hair or an extract thereof or Fel dl, or being
exposed to an environment in which a cat resides, such as a corticosteroid. The antibodies may
also be used in conjunction with other therapies, such as a vaccine specific for the Fel dl allergen.
The additional therapeutically active component(s) may be administered prior to, concurrent with,
or after the administration of the anti-Fel dl antibody of the present invention. For purposes of the
present disclosure, such administration regimens are considered the administration of an anti-Fel
dl antibody "in combination with" a second therapeutically active component.
Administration Regimens
[0220] According to certain embodiments of the present invention, multiple doses of one or more
anti-Fel dl antibodies (an antibody combination) or a bi-specific antigen-binding molecule may be
administered to a subject over a defined time course. The methods according to this aspect of the
invention comprise sequentially administering to a subject multiple doses of an antibody, antibody
combination, or a bi-specific antigen-binding molecule of the invention. As used herein,
"sequentially administering" means that each dose of an antibody, antibody combination, or a bi
specific antigen-binding molecule is administered to the subject at a different point in time, e.g., on
different days separated by a predetermined interval (e.g., hours, days, weeks or months). The
present invention includes methods, which comprise sequentially administering to the patient a
single initial dose of an antibody, antibody combination, or a bi-specific antigen-binding molecule,
followed by one or more secondary doses of the antibody, and optionally followed by one or more
tertiary doses of the antibody.
[0221] The terms "initial dose," "secondary doses," and "tertiary doses," refer to the temporal
sequence of administration of an antibody, antibody combination, or a bi-specific antigen-binding
molecule of the invention. Thus, the "initial dose" is the dose which is administered at the
beginning of the treatment regimen (also referred to as the "baseline dose"); the "secondary doses"
are the doses which are administered after the initial dose; and the "tertiary doses" are the doses
which are administered after the secondary doses. The initial, secondary, and tertiary doses may
all contain the same amount of an antibody, antibody combination, or a bi-specific antigen-binding

certain embodiments, however, the amount of an antibody, antibody combination, or a bi-specific
antigen-binding molecule contained in the initial, secondary and/or tertiary doses varies from one
another (e.g., adjusted up or down as appropriate) during the course of treatment. In certain
embodiments, two or more (e.g., 2, 3, 4, or 5) doses are administered at the beginning of the
treatment regimen as "loading doses" followed by subsequent doses that are administered on a
less frequent basis (e.g., "maintenance doses").
[0222] In one exemplary embodiment of the present invention, each secondary and/or tertiary dose
is administered 1 to 26 (e.g., 1, 1%, 2, 2%, 3, 3%, 4, 4%, 5, 5 , 6, 6%, 7, 7 , 8, 8 , 9, 9 , 10,
10 , 11, 11      , 12, 12 , 13, 13 , 14, 14   , 15, 15 , 16, 16 , 17, 17 , 18, 18 , 19, 19 , 20, 20   ,
21, 21    , 22, 22 , 23, 23 , 24, 24 , 25, 25 , 26, 26 , or more) weeks after the immediately
preceding dose. The phrase "the immediately preceding dose," as used herein, means, in a
sequence of multiple administrations, the dose of an antibody, antibody combination, or a bi
specific antigen-binding molecule, which is administered to a patient prior to the administration of
the very next dose in the sequence with no intervening doses.
[0223] The methods according to this aspect of the invention may comprise administering to a
patient any number of secondary and/or tertiary doses of an antibody, antibody combination, or a
bi-specific antigen-binding molecule that specifically binds Fel dl. For example, in certain
embodiments, only a single secondary dose is administered to the patient. In other embodiments,
two or more (e.g., 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or more) secondary doses are administered to the patient.
Likewise, in certain embodiments, only a single tertiary dose is administered to the patient. In other
embodiments, two or more (e.g., 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or more) tertiary doses are administered to the
patient.
[0224] In embodiments involving multiple secondary doses, each secondary dose may be
administered at the same frequency as the other secondary doses. For example, each secondary
dose may be administered to the patient 1 to 2 weeks after the immediately preceding dose.
Similarly, in embodiments involving multiple tertiary doses, each tertiary dose may be administered
at the same frequency as the other tertiary doses. For example, each tertiary dose may be
administered to the patient 2 to 4 weeks after the immediately preceding dose. Alternatively, the
frequency at which the secondary and/or tertiary doses are administered to a patient can vary over
the course of the treatment regimen. The frequency of administration may also be adjusted during
the course of treatment by a physician depending on the needs of the individual patient following
clinical examination.
Diagnostic Uses of the Antibodies
[0225] The anti-Fel dl antibodies of the present invention may also be used to detect and/or
measure Fel dl in a sample, e.g., for diagnostic purposes. It is envisioned that confirmation of an

allergic response thought to be caused by Fel dl may be made by measuring the presence of
either Fel dl through use of any one or more of the antibodies of the invention. Exemplary
diagnostic assays for Fel dl may comprise, e.g., contacting a sample, obtained from a patient, with
an anti-Fel dl antibody of the invention, wherein the anti-Fel dl antibody is labeled with a
detectable label or reporter molecule or used as a capture ligand to selectively isolate Fel dl
protein from patient samples. Alternatively, an unlabeled anti-Fel dl antibody can be used in
diagnostic applications in combination with a secondary antibody which is itself detectably labeled.
                                                                                     32
The detectable label or reporter molecule can be a radioisotope, such as 3 H, 14c,     P, 35S, or 1251; a
fluorescent or chemiluminescent moiety such as fluorescein isothiocyanate, or rhodamine; or an
enzyme such as alkaline phosphatase, p-galactosidase, horseradish peroxidase, or luciferase.
Specific exemplary assays that can be used to detect or measure Fel dl in a sample include
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), radioimmunoassay (RIA), and fluorescence
activated cell sorting (FACS).
[0226] Samples that can be used in Fel dl diagnostic assays according to the present invention
include any tissue or fluid sample obtainable from a patient, which contains detectable quantities of
Fel dl protein, or fragments thereof, under normal or pathological conditions. Generally, levels of
Fel dl in a particular sample obtained from a healthy/non-allergic patient (e.g., a patient not
afflicted with a sensitivity associated with the presence of Fel dl) will be measured to initially
establish a baseline, or standard, level of Fel dl. This baseline level of Fel dl can then be
compared against the levels of Fel dl measured in samples obtained from individuals suspected of
having a sensitivity to Fel dl in cat dander, or symptoms associated with such condition.

Example 1. Generation of Human Antibodies to Fel d1
[0228] An immunogen comprising any one of the following can be used to generate antibodies to
Fel dl. In certain embodiments, the antibodies of the invention are obtained from mice immunized
with a primary immunogen, such as full length natural Fel dl (nFel dl), which may be purchased
commercially (e.g., from Indoor Biotechnologies, # LTN-FD1-1), or isolated from cat hair or dander
                                                    51

      WO 2013/166236                                                            PCT/US2013/039192
by multi-step column chromatography (See, for example, Chapman MD, et al. (1988), J. Immunol.
140:812-818), or which may be produced recombinantly (See GenBank accession numbers
P30438, or NP_001041618.1 for the full length amino acid sequence of chain 1 of Fel dl (also
referred to as chain A or FELD1 A; also see SEQ ID NO: 392) and GenBank accession number
P30440, or NP_001041619.1 for the full length amino acid sequence of chain 2 of Fel dl (also
referred to as chain B or FELD B; also see SEQ ID NO: 393), or fragments of either chain 1 or
chain 2, or fragments from both chain 1 and chain 2 of the Fel dl protein, followed by immunization
with a secondary immunogen, or with an immunogenically active fragment of the natural protein.
Animals may be immunized with either chain 1 protein alone or chain 2 protein alone, or with both
chain 1 and chain 2 proteins, administered sequentially, or concurrently. Various constructs may
be prepared using portions of chain 1 and chain 2 along with various linking or spacer strategies
known to those skilled in the art. These constructs may be used alone, or in various combinations
to elicit antibody responses in vivo. For example, recombinant Fel dl constructs, such as those
exemplified in SEQ ID NOs: 385, 394, 395, 396 or 397, or fragments thereof, may be used as
immunogens.
[0229] In certain embodiments, the antibodies of the invention are obtained from mice immunized
with a primary immunogen, such as a biologically active and/or immunogenic fragment of natural
Fel dl, or DNA encoding the active fragment thereof. The fragment may be derived from the N
terminal or C-terminal domain of either chain 1 and/or chain 2 of Fel dl.
[0230] In certain embodiments, the recombinantly produced Fel dl immunogen may be made by
direct fusion of the two chains of Fel dl, as described in Kaiser et. al., to produce a fusion product
that has a similar refolding pattern to that of natural Fel dl (Kaiser, L. et al., (2003), J. Biol. Chem.
278(39):37730-37735). In certain embodiments, the immunogen may be a fusion protein such as
that shown in the constructs of SEQ ID NOs: 385, 394, 395, 396 or 397, followed by immunization
with a secondary immunogen, or with an immunogenically active fragment of the natural or
recombinantly produced Fel dl.
[0231] In certain embodiments, the recombinant Fel dl protein constructs used in the studies
described herein are comprised of either i) Fel dl B chain (chain 2) and Fel dl A chain (chain 1)
linked as a continuous, in-line fusion (with Fel dl B chain at the N-terminus) or ii) a continuous, in
line fusion with Fel dl A chain at the N-terminus followed by a flexible linker [(Gly4Ser) 3] followed
by Fel dl B. These constructs may also include a C-terminal tag (myc-myc-His6 or mouse IgG2a
Fc region), as indicated below. The proteins were expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)
cells. An exogenous signal sequence used to promote expression in CHO cells is not included in
the sequence listings.
[0232] In certain embodiments, the immunogen may be a fusion protein comprising any one or
more of the following: i) amino acid residues 18-109 of chain 2 of Fel dl (See GenBank accession
                                                    52

number P30440 and also SEQ ID NO: 393) fused via the C terminus directly with the N terminus of
amino acid residues 23-92 of chain 1 of Fel dl (See GenBank accession number P30438 and also
SEQ ID NO: 392); ii) amino acid residues 23-92 of chain 1 of Fel dl (See GenBank accession
number P30438 and also SEQ ID NO: 392) fused via the C terminus to the N terminus of amino
acid residues 18-109 of chain 2 of Fel dl (See GenBank accession number P30440 and also SEQ
ID NO: 393); iii) amino acid residues 18-109 of chain 2 of Fel dl (See GenBank accession number
NP_001041619.1) fused via the C terminus directly with the N terminus of amino acid residues 19
88 of chain 1 of Fel dl (See GenBank accession number NP_001041618.), such as the construct
shown in SEQ ID NO: 394 or 396; iv) amino acid residues 19-88 of chain 1 of Fel dl (See GenBank
accession number NP_001041618.1) fused via the C terminus to the N terminus of amino acid
residues 18-109 of chain 2 of Fel dl (See GenBank accession number NP_001041619.1). See
also SEQ ID NO: 395). In certain embodiments, the fusion protein may have a tag at the C terminal
end of the construct, such as a myc-myc-hexahistidine tag (See SEQ ID NOs: 385, 396 or 397 for
such constructs.). In related embodiments, the fusion protein may have a mouse Fc coupled at the
C terminal end of the construct (See SEQ ID NOs: 394 or 395 for such constructs.). In certain
embodiments, chains 1 and 2 are coupled via a linker known to those skilled in the art, e.g. (G4 S) 3
(See SEQ ID NOs: 395 and 397 for such a construct.).
[0233] In certain embodiments, antibodies that bind specifically to Fel dl may be prepared using
fragments of the above-noted regions, or peptides that extend beyond the designated regions by
about 5 to about 20 amino acid residues from either, or both, the N or C terminal ends of the
regions described herein. In certain embodiments, any combination of the above-noted regions or
fragments thereof may be used in the preparation of Fel dl specific antibodies. In certain
embodiments, any one or more of the above-noted regions of Fel d1, or fragments thereof may be
used for preparing monospecific, bispecific, or multispecific antibodies.
[0234] The full length proteins, or fragments thereof, that were used as immunogens, as noted
above, were administered directly, with an adjuvant to stimulate the immune response, to a
VELOCIMMUNE* mouse comprising DNA encoding human Immunoglobulin heavy and kappa light
chain variable regions. The antibody immune response was monitored by a Fel d1-specific
immunoassay. When a desired immune response was achieved splenocytes were harvested and
fused with mouse myeloma cells to preserve their viability and form hybridoma cell lines. The
hybridoma cell lines were screened and selected to identify cell lines that produce Fel dl specific
antibodies. Using this technique, and the various immunogens described above, several anti-Fel
dl, chimeric antibodies (i.e., antibodies possessing human variable domains and mouse constant
domains) were obtained; certain exemplary antibodies generated in this manner were designated
as H1M1230N, H1M1234N, H1M1241N, H2M1233N, H2M1236N, H2M1237N, and H2M1242N.

[0235] Anti-Fel dl antibodies were also isolated directly from antigen-positive B cells without fusion
to myeloma cells, as described in U.S. 2007/0280945A1.         Using this method, several fully human
anti-Fel d1antibodies (i.e., antibodies possessing human variable domains and human constant
domains) were obtained; exemplary antibodies generated in this manner were designated as
follows: H4H2574P, H4H2590S, H4H2592B, H4H2594S, H4H2597P, H4H2606B, H4H2607B,
H4H2608B, H4H2636P, H4H2645P, H4H2793P, H4H2797P and H4H2864P.
[0236] The biological properties of the exemplary antibodies generated in accordance with the
methods of this Example are described in detail in the Examples set forth below.
Example 2. Heavy and Light Chain Variable Region Amino Acid Sequences
[0237] Table 1 sets forth the heavy and light chain variable region amino acid sequence pairs of
selected antibodies specific for Fel di and their corresponding antibody identifiers. Antibodies are
typically referred to herein according to the following nomenclature: Fc prefix (e.g. "H4H", "H1 M,
"H2M"), followed by a numerical identifier (e.g. "1232" as shown in Table 1), followed by a "P" or "N"
suffix. Thus, according to this nomenclature, an antibody may be referred to as, e.g. "H1 M1232N".
The H4H, H1 M, and H2M prefixes on the antibody designations used herein indicate the particular
Fc region of the antibody. For example, an "H2M" antibody has a mouse IgG2 Fc, whereas an
"H4H" antibody has a human IgG4 Fc. As will be appreciated by a person of ordinary skill in the
art, an H1 M or H2M antibody can be converted to an H4H antibody, and vice versa, but in any
event, the variable domains (including the CDRs), which are indicated by the numerical identifiers
shown in Table 1, will remain the same. Antibodies having the same numerical antibody
designation, but differing by a letter suffix of N, B, S or P refer to antibodies having heavy and light
chains with identical CDR sequences but with sequence variations in regions that fall outside of the
CDR sequences (i.e., in the framework regions). Thus, N, B, S and P variants of a particular
antibody have identical CDR sequences within their heavy and light chain variable regions but differ
from one another within their framework regions.

Example 4. Antibody Binding to Fel dl as Determined by Surface Plasmon Resonance
[0239] Binding associative and dissociative rate constants (ka and kd, respectively) and calculated
equilibrium dissociation constants and dissociative half-lives (KD and t 1/2 , respectively) for antigen
binding to anti-Fel dl monoclonal antibodies were determined using a real-time surface plasmon
resonance biosensor (Biacore T200 or Biacore 2000) assay. The Biacore sensor surface was
derivatized with either polyclonal rabbit anti-mouse antibody (GE Healthcare, # BR-1008-38) or with
monoclonal mouse anti-human Fc antibody (GE Healthcare, # BR-1008-39) to capture anti-Fel dl

antibodies, expressed with mouse Fc (antibody ID prefix H1 M, H2M, H2aM, H2bM) or human IgG4
Fc (antibody ID prefix H4H), respectively. For kinetic fits, at least two different concentrations
(ranging from 390 pM to 67nM) of natural Fel dl (Indoor Biotech, # NA-FD1-2) or a recombinant
version of the protein, Fel dl (B-A)-mmH (SEQ ID NO: 396) were injected over the anti-Fel dl
monoclonal antibody-captured surface at 25'C at a flow rate of 50pl/min in running buffer (10mM
HEPES, 150mM NaCl, 0.05% P20, 3mM MgCl 2 , 3mM CaCl 2 ). Fel dl (B-A)-mmH was expressed in
Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and is comprised of amino acids 18-109 of Fel dl B (accession
#P30440) fused in-line with amino acids 23-92 of Fel dl A (accession #P30438) with a C-terminal
myc-myc-hexahistidine tag. Antibody-antigen association was monitored for 3 to 5 minutes, and the
dissociation of antigen from the captured monoclonal antibody (in running buffer alone at 25'C)
was monitored for 10 or 15 minutes. Kinetic association (ka) and dissociation (kd) rate constants
were determined by processing and fitting the data to a 1:1 binding model using Scrubber 2.0 curve
fitting software. Binding dissociation equilibrium constants (KD) and dissociative half-lives (t1 /2 ) were
calculated from the kinetic rate constants as:    KD = kdlka and t 1/2 = ln(2)Ikd. Binding parameters for
different anti-Fel dl monoclonal antibodies are tabulated in Table 3 and Table 4. Table 3 shows
the Biacore affinities at 25'C for natural Fel dl binding to captured anti-Fel dl monoclonal
antibodies and Table 4 shows the Biacore affinities at 25'C for recombinant Fel dl binding to
captured anti-Fel dl monoclonal antibodies.
[0240] As shown in Table 3, 10 of the 25 antibodies tested exhibited          KD  values below 1nM for
binding to natural Fel dl, ranging from 207 pM to 982 pM. As shown in Table 4, 17 of the 25
antibodies tested exhibited   KD values below 1nM for binding to recombinant Fel dl, ranging from
144 pM to 924 pM. Two of the antibodies, H4H2574B and H4H2793P, bound to recombinant, but
not natural Fel d1 under these experimental conditions.

Example 5. Cross Competition of anti-Fel d1 Antibodies for Binding to Natural (n) Fel d1
[0241] A binding experiment was performed using an Octet Red biosensor system (Fortebio Inc.)
to determine cross-competition for a panel of 8 anti-Fel dl antibodies binding to natural Fel dl
(nFel dl; Indoor Biotechnologies, #NA-FD1-2). The experiment was performed at 25'C in HBST
buffer (0.01 M HEPES pH7.4, 0.15M NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, 0.05% v/v Surfactant P20) containing
0.1 mg/mL BSA. A washing step with the HBST buffer was performed between each binding step,
and plates were agitated during the binding and washing steps using an orbital plate shaker at
1000rpm. A first anti-Fel dl antibody (mAb-1) was captured for 2 minutes onto the anti-hFc
biosensor surface from stock solutions of antibody at 10ug/mL (final capture levels -1.5nm
response units). The coated sensor tips were then blocked for 5 minutes with a 100ug/mL solution
of an irrelevant antibody. Sensor tips were then submerged into wells containing 500nM of nFel dl
for 5 minutes, and then into wells containing 50 ug/mL solutions of a second anti-Fel dl antibody
(mAb-2). The mAb-2 solutions were supplemented with 100ug/mL of an irrelevant antibody to
minimize non-specific binding. The binding responses for mAb-2 binding to nFel dl pre-complexed
with mAb-1 were measured for the 8x8 antibody matrix (Table 5). Each binding value for mAb-2
binding to a different mAb-1/Fel dl capture surface (down a column in Table 5) was subtracted by
the mAb-1/Fel dl/mAb-2 self-competition value (where mAb-1 = mAb-2; across the diagonal in
Table 5). Values below 0.1Onm indicate cross-competition of mAb-1 and mAb-2 to a common
binding site on Fel dl.

[0242] Four antibodies, H4H2636P, H4H1616N, H4H2645P, and H4H2864P, bi-directionally
compete with each other for binding to nFel dl, but do not compete with any of the other anti- Fel
dl antibodies. Two antibodies, H4H1232N and H4H2597P, bi-directionally compete with each other
for binding to nFel dl. Both H4H1232N and H4H2597P uni-directionally compete with H4H1300N.
Bi-directional competition with H4H1300N could not be determined because H4H1300N did not
pre-complex with nFel dl. H4H1238N did not compete with any of the anti- Fel dl antibodies for
binding to nFel dl.

Example 6. Effect of anti-Fel d1 Antibodies in a Passive Cutaneous Anaphylaxis (PCA) in
vivo Model
[0243] The passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA) in vivo model was used to assess in vivo mast
cell degranulation. The model involves intradermal injection of an allergen-specific antiserum into a
local area on the skin followed by intravenous injection of an antigen along
with a dye. The allergic reaction causes capillary dilatation and increased vascular permeability at
the site of sensitization, resulting in preferential accumulation of dye at this site. The dye can be
extracted from the tissue and quantitated spectrophotometrically. Dye extravasation into tissue

sensitized with test antiserum is compared to extravasation into tissue sensitized with a non
relevant antiserum.
[0244] Antisera were generated by immunizing Balb/c mice with 5 pg natural Fel dl protein purified
from cat hair extract (Indoor Biotechnologies, # LTN-FD1-1), 5 pg of crude peanut allergen extract
(Greer Laboratories, # XPF171D3A25), or 1250 of Bioequivalent allergy units (BAU) of
standardized cat hair extract (Greer Laboratories, #GTE3AO1) in a solution of 1mg/ml of alum
(Pierce, # 77161) in 1X phosphate buffered saline. Two weeks later (day 14) sensitized mice were
boosted with doses of allergen identical to those used for the initial immunization. Two weeks after
the boost (day 28), mice were sacrificed and serum was collected. Total IgE concentration in the
isolated antisera was determined by ELISA. The final concentration of antiserum was diluted to
2400ng/mL IgE in 1X phosphate buffered saline.
[0245] To determine the effect of anti-Fel dl antibodies on mast cell degranulation in the PCA
model, prior to ear sensitization with antiserum generated as described above, groups of Balb/c
mice were first injected subcutaneously with either a human IgG4 isotype control antibody, an anti
Fel dl antibody, or a combination of anti-Fel dl antibodies at doses of 5mg/kg (total antibody dose,
2.5mg/kg of each antibody) for single point experiments unless otherwise indicated or at
concentrations ranging from 0.06mg/kg to 2mg/kg for dose-ranging experiments. Three days after
pre-treatment with antibodies, one group of mice ("natural Fel dl group") was sensitized by
intradermal injection with 1Opl of natural Fel d1-derived antiserum or 1Opl of peanut-derived
antiserum (negative control) into the right and left ears, respectively, of each mouse. A second
group of mice ("cat extract group") was sensitized with 20pL of cat hair extract-derived antiserum or
20pL of peanut-derived antiserum (negative control) into the right and left ears, respectively, of
each mouse. Twenty-four hours after sensitization, mice in the natural Fel dl group were
challenged by intravenous injection (100 pL per mouse) of a solution of 0.25 pg/mL natural Fel dl
(Indoor Biotechnologies, # LTN-FD1-1) dissolved in 1X phosphate buffered saline containing 0.5%
(w/v) Evan's blue dye (Sigma, # E2129). Similarly, 24 hours after sensitization, mice in the cat
extract group were challenged with 250BAU of standardized cat hair extract [standardized cat hair
extract (Greer Laboratories, #GTE3A01)] dissolved in 1X phosphate buffered saline containing
0.5% (w/v) Evan's blue dye (Sigma, # E2129). One hour after antigen challenge, mice were
sacrificed, ears were excised and placed in 1 mL formamide and incubated for 3 days at 56"C to
extract the Evan's blue dye from the tissue. Ear tissue was then removed from the formamide,
blotted to remove excess liquid and weighed. Two hundred microliter aliquots of each formamide
extract were transferred to 96 well plates in duplicate. Absorbance of the resulting supernatants
was measured at 620nm. The OD was converted to Evan's blue dye concentration using a
standard curve. The average concentration of Evan's blue dye extravasated into the tissue of the
antisera-sensitized ear (normalized by ear tissue weight) was calculated for the group treated with
                                                   61

     WO 2013/166236                                                          PCT/US2013/039192
the isotype control antibody and defined as F(isotype,avg). The reduction in Evan's blue dye
extravasation resulting from antibody pre-treatment was calculated per mouse by subtracting the
amount of Evan's blue dye for the antibody-treated group's Fel dl or extract sensitized ear, defined
as F(mAb,i), from F(isotype,avg). This number was then divided by the difference between
F(isotype,avg) and the dye amount for the antibody-treated group's peanut sensitized ear
[P(mAb,i)] and multiplied by 100 to give the overall percent reduction in dye extravasation for each
mouse (% Reduction).
[0246] % Reduction (per mouse) = 100*[F(isotype,avg) - F(mAb,i)]/[F(isotype,avg) - P(mAb,i)]
[0247] The average percent reduction in dye leakage was then calculated for each antibody group.
Results, expressed as (mean  SD) of percent Evan's blue reduction are shown in Table 6 and
Table 7 for the natural Fel dl group and in Table 8 for the cat hair extract group.
[0248] As shown in Table 6, seven groups of mice from the natural Fel dl group, when treated
with specific combinations of anti-Fel dl antibodies at fixed concentrations, exhibited reductions in
dye extravasations ranging from 79% to 103% compared to mice receiving control antibody. Mice
treated with H4H2590S/H4H 1238N, H4H2590S/H4H2574P, or H4H 1232N/H4H 1616N pairwise
antibody combinations exhibited less than 3% reduction in dye extravasation compared to mice
receiving control antibody, demonstrating that not all anti-Fel dl antibodies tested in this model
were efficacious.
[0249] In addition, dose-ranging experiments were performed with mice from the natural Fel dl
group, as shown in Table 7. Single antibodies were not as effective at reducing dye extravasation
as the anti-Fel dl antibody combinations at the tested doses.
[0250] A specific pair of anti-Fel dl antibodies (H4H2636P and H4H1232N) at multiple dose levels,
as well as each of these anti-Fel dl antibodies alone at a single (highest) dose level, was further
tested in the PCA model using mice that were sensitized and challenged with cat hair extract as
shown in Table 8. At 2mg/kg, these single anti-Fel dl antibodies alone were not as efficacious at
reducing dye extravasation as a combination of the two antibodies. The combination of H4H2636P
and H4H1232N at both 2mg/kg and 1mg/kg reduced dye extravasation by more than 90% as
compared with the isotype control in the PCA model using cat hair extract as the antigen.
[0251] All reductions that were statistically significant (p<0.05) compared to isotype control as
determined by two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni's post-test are noted with an asterisk (*). The
number of mice used per group (n) is noted within parentheses in the tables.

Example 7. Effect of anti-Fel d1l antibodies in a lung inflammation in vivo model
[0252] The lung inflammation in vivo mouse model is used to assess allergen induced lung
inflammation and mucus accumulation that could be associated with asthma or rhinoconjuctivitis.
The model involves repeated intranasal administration of an allergen into previously allergen
sensitized mice. The allergen-associated inflammation can cause increases in lung mucus
accumulation, eosinophil migration into the lung, serum total IgE, and allergen specific IgG1 levels.
[0253] Balb/c mice were intraperitoneally immunized with 1ug of natural Fel d 1 protein purified
from cat hair extract (Indoor Biotechnologies, #LTN-FD1-1) in a solution of 1mg/mL of alum (Pierce,
# 77161) in 1X phosphate buffered saline. Seven days later, sensitized mice were boosted
intraperitoneally with 1 ug of natural Fel d 1 in a solution of 1mg/mL alum in 1X phosphate buffered
saline. On days 17, 21, and 25, groups of mice (n=5) were injected subcutaneously with a human
IgG4 isotype control antibody or a 1:1 combination of anti- Fel d 1 antibodies, H4H1232N and
H4H2636P, at 20mg/kg (total antibody dose). On days 20, 24, and 28, mice were intranasally
challenged with 0.05 ug of natural Fel d 1 diluted in 20 uL of 1X phosphate buffered saline. Control
mice were challenged with 20 uL of 1X phosphate buffered saline on the same days. On day 32, all
mice were sacrificed and their lungs were harvested. Experimental dosing and treatment protocol
for groups of mice are shown in Table 9.
                                                    64

      WO 2013/166236                                                        PCT/US2013/039192
[0254] To determine circulating total IgE and Fel d 1 specifc IgG1 in the serum of the mice, serum
samples were collected for each mouse via terminal cardiac puncture using a 27G1/2 1 mL TB
syringe (Becton Dickinson, #309306) with a needle attached. Blood samples were placed into BD
microtainer@ serum separator tubes (Becton Dickinson, #365956), centrifuged, and then the serum
was transferred to a fresh tube for storage until analysis.
[0255] To determine the total IgE concentration in the serum samples for each mouse, a sandwich
ELISA OPTEIA kit (BD Biosciences, #555248) was used according to the manufacturer's
instructions. Serum samples were diluted and incubated with anti-IgE capture antibody coated on
96-well plates. Total IgE was detected by biotinylated anti-mouse IgE secondary antibody. Purified
horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled mouse IgE was used as a standard. The chromagen
3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) (BD OPTEIA substrate reagent set, BD, #555214) was used
to detect HRP activity. A stop solution of 1M sulfuric acid was then added, and absorbance at
450nm was measured on a Molecular Devices SpectraMax M5 plate reader. Data analysis was
performed using PrismTM software. The mean amounts of circulating IgE levels in serum for each
experimental group are expressed as ng/mL ( SEM) as shown in Table 10. Mice challenged with
Fel d 1 intranasally when treated with the combination of anti- Fel d 1 antibodies exhibited a
significant decrease in the amount of circulating IgE [6683 (1394) ng/mL] compared to mice
receiving isotype control antibody [14080 (1505) ng/mL].
[0256] To determine the Fel d 1 specific IgG1 levels in the serum samples from each mouse, an
ELISA was utilized. Fel d 1 coated plates were incubated with serially diluted mouse serum
samples, followed by incubation with anti-mouse IgG1-HRP conjugated antibody (BD Biosciences,
# 559626). All samples were developed with a TMB solution and analyzed as described above.
Relative levels of circulating IgG1 in serum were represented as titer units (titer units were
calculated by multiplying the measured OD by a dilution factor required to achieve OD450 that was
greater than two times background). The mean circulating Fel d 1-specific IgG1 levels in serum for
each experimental group are expressed as titer x 103 (SEM) as shown in Table 11. Mice
challenged with Fel d 1 intranasally when treated with the combination of anti- Fel d 1 antibodies
exhibited a significant decrease in the amount of Fel d 1-specific IgG1 levels in serum [titer of 105.3
(31.33)   x10 3
                 ] when compared to mice receiving isotype control antibody [titer of 526.1 (144.0)
x10 3].
Lung harvest for cell infiltrate analysis:
[0257] After exsanguination, the right lung from each mouse was removed and placed into a small
petri dish containing Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) (Irvine Scientific, #9033) and
chopped into cubes that were approximately 2 to 3 mm in size. The cubes were then transferred to
a tube containing a solution of 20 pg/mL DNAse (Roche, #10104159001) and 0.7 U/mL Liberase
                                                   65

TH (Roche, #05401151001) diluted in Hank's Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) (Gibco, #14025) and
placed into a 37'C water bath for 20 minutes with vortexing every 5 minutes. This reaction was
then stopped by adding ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) (Gibco, #15575) at a final
concentration of 10mM. Each lung was mashed, filtered through a 70 pm filter, centrifuged, and
then lung pellet was resuspended in 4 mL of ACK lysing buffer (Gibco, #10492) to remove red
blood cells. After a 3 minute room temperature incubation, DMEM was added to deactivate the
ACK buffer. The cell suspensions were centrifuged, and the cell pellets were then resuspended into
10 mL of MACS buffer solution [a mixture of Miltenyi auto MACS Rinsing Solution (Militenyi Biotec,
#130-091-222) and MACS BSA (Militenyi Biotec, #130-091-376)]. The resuspended samples were
filtered through a 70 pm filter and lx106 cells were plated into a 96-well V-bottom plate. Cells were
then centrifuged and the pellets were resuspended in purified rat anti-mouse CD16/CD32 Fc Block,
(BD Biosciences Clone: 2.4G2, #553142) diluted in MACS Buffer for 15 minutes at 40'C. The cells
were washed twice and were then incubated in the appropriate antibody mixture (described in
Table 12) diluted in MACS buffer for 30 minutes at 4'C protected from light. After antibody
incubation, the cells were washed twice in MACS buffer and resuspended in BD cytofix (BD
Biosciences, #554655) for 15 minutes at 4'C while being protected from light. The cells were
washed, resuspended in MACS buffer and were then transferred to BD FACS tubes (BD
Biosciences, #352235) for analysis of eosinophils by flow cytometry. Eosinophils were defined as
cells that were CD45*, GR1-, CD11 c'", SiglecFhi. Data are expressed as frequency of eosinophils in
CD45* cells ( SEM) in Table 13.
[0258] Mice challenged with Fel d 1 intranasally when treated with the combination of anti- Fel d 1
antibodies exhibited a significant decrease in the frequency of eosinophils in the CD45* cell
population as compared to mice receiving no antibody (67% decrease) or receiving isotype control
antibody (46% decrease) as shown in Table 13.
Lung harvest for histological analysis:
[0259] After exsanguination, the left lungs were removed and placed into tubes containing a 5 mL
solution of 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde (Boston Bioproducts, # BM-155) in 1X phosphate buffered
saline and stored at room temperature for 3 days. Lung samples were then blotted dry and
transferred to tubes containing 70% ethanol for histological analysis. The samples were sent to
Histoserv, Inc (Germantown, MD) for sectioning and periodic acid Schiff (PAS) staining.
[0260] Approximately 35 digital images across the full area of each PAS-stained lung section were
acquired using a Zeiss Axioplan 2 Imaging light microscope with a Zeiss AxioCam MRc camera. A
whole lung image was then constructed from the smaller images and analyzed using ImageJ
software with the aid of a color threshold plugin. The regions of mucus accumulation in the
bronchial lumen were identified and quantitated through a user-chosen color threshold and
                                                   66

normalized to the total area of the lumen that was identified and quantitated by a separate color
threshold setting. Percentage of the bronchial lumen occupied by mucus accumulation for each
lung was expressed as [(mucus area/lumen area) x 100] and was calculated for each treatment
group. Results, expressed as mean percent lung obstruction ( SEM) are shown in Table 14.
[0261] Mice treated with the combination of anti- Fel d 1 antibodies exhibited a trend towards
reduced mucus accumulation in the lung bronchi (5.21+/-0.81 % mucus accumulation) compared to
mice receiving control antibody (10.81+/-1.13% mucus accumulation) in the lung inflammation
model as shown in Table 14.. No differences were observed in bronchial lumen size or overall lung
size between the groups of mice.

Example 8. Hydrogen-Deuterium Exchange Epitope Mapping
[0262] In order to determine the epitopes of Fel dl (a heterodimeric protein comprised of Fel dl
chain A and FELD1 chain B) recognized by two anti-Fel dl antibodies, hydrogen-deuterium (H/D)
exchange studies were performed for each antibody co-complexed with Fel dl. Prior to the H/D
exchange experiments, CHO cell-expressed recombinant Fel dl comprised of amino acids 18-109
of Feld 1 chain B (GenBank accession number NP_001041619.1) fused in-line with amino acids
19-88 of FELD1 A (GenBank accession #NP_001041618.1) expressed with a C-terminal myc-myc
hexahistidine tag and with a D27G mutation (Fel dl B-A-mmH; SEQ ID: 396) was deglycosylated at
37 0 C for 4 hours under native conditions using PNGase F (New England BioLabs, #0704). For this
study, two anti-FELD1 antibodies (H4H1232N and H4H2636P) were covalently attached to N
hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) agarose beads (GE Lifescience, #17-0906-01) according to the
manufacturer's protocol.
[0263] To map the Fel d1B-A-mmH binding epitope recognized by H4H1232N, two sets of H/D
exchange experiments were carried out (all binding and exchange reactions carried out at room
temperature). The first experiment used an 'on-solution/off-beads' format (on-exchange in solution
followed by off-exchange on beads). For the on-exchange, the deglycosylated Fel d1 B-A-mm H
protein was deuterated for 5 and 10 minutes (in two separate sub-experiments) in PBS buffer at pH
7.4 prepared with D2 0 (PBS-D) and was then bound to the H4H1232N beads during a 2-minute
incubation in PBS-D. The co-complex of Fel dlB-A-mmH-bound to H4H1232N beads was then
washed with PBS buffer at pH 7.4 prepared with H2 0 (PBS-H) and incubated in PBS-H for half of
the on-exchange time (off-exchange), allowing only the epitopes on Fel dl B-A-mmH protected by
the binding of the H4H1232N antibody to remain deuterated. After the off-exchange, the bound Fel
d1B-A-mmH was eluted from the beads using an ice-cold 0.1% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid (TFA)
                                                  69

      WO 2013/166236                                                       PCT/US2013/039192
solution. The eluted Fel d1B-A-mmH was then digested with immobilized pepsin (Thermo Scientific,
#20343) for 5 minutes at 4'C. The resulting peptides were desalted at 4'C using ZipTip
chromatographic pipette tips (Millipore, #ZTC18S096) according to the manufacturer's protocol and
then immediately analyzed on an UltrafleXtreme matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time of
flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometer (MS).
[0264] The second experiment is referred to as the 'on-beads/off-beads' (on-exchange on beads
followed by off-exchange on beads). For this experiment, the deglycosylated Fel d1 B-A-mmH was
first bound to the H4H1232N beads, and then incubated for 5 or 10 minutes (in separate sub
experiments) in PBS-D to allow on-exchange. The following steps (off-exchange, pepsin digestion,
and MS analysis) were carried out as described for the 'on-solution/off-beads' procedure above.
The centroid values or average mass-to-charge ratios (m/z) of all the detected peptides were
calculated and compared between the on-solution/off-beads and on-beads/off-beads experiments.
Peptides exhibiting increased mass after the on-solution/off-beads procedure compared to the on
beads/off-beads procedure include amino acids within the Fel dl protein protected from exchange
as a result of antibody binding and therefore reveal binding epitope regions.
[0265] The H/D exchange experiment for Fel dl B-A-mmH binding to the anti-Fel dl antibody
H4H2636P was performed using the same procedure described above for H4H1232N, but with
H4H2636P beads replacing the H4H1232N beads.
[0266] A comparison of the centroid m/z values for all the peptides detected in the H/D exchange
experiment of Fel dlB-A-mmH with H4H1232N are shown in Table 15. These peptides were
identified by liquid chromatography-matrix assisted laser desorption ionization (LC-MALDI) MS.
Most peptic peptides gave similar centroid values (differences < 0.3 m/z units) for both the on
solution/off-beads and on-beads/off-beads protocols, for each of two different on-exchange and off
exchange times. However, three peptides with amino acids spanning from 85-103, 85-104, and
113-127 of Fel d1B-A-mmH (SEQ ID NO: 396) had differences in m/z centroid values > 0.3 in both
the 5 minute and 10 minute experiments. The differences between these centroid values from the
on-solution/off-beads and on-beads/off-beads protocol are highlighted in bold in Table 15. Since
another peptide, amino acids 117-127 of SEQ ID NO: 396, did not show deuteron retention after
off-exchange, the region of protection from exchange in the 113-127 peptide can be reduced to
residues 113-116 of SEQ ID NO: 396. The two regions, residues 85-104 (SEQ ID NO: 403) and
113-116 (SEQ ID NO: 426), are protected from full off-exchange as a result of H4H1232N binding
to Fel dl B-A-mmH after on-exchange. Therefore, these two segments are defined by the H/D
exchange method as a discontinuous epitope for antibody H4H1232N binding to the Fel dl B-A
mmH protein.
[0267] Comparisons of the centroid m/z values for the peptides detected in the H/D exchange
experiment of Fel dlB-A-mmH complexed with H4H2636P are shown in Table 16. Only one

peptide, amino acids 15-24 of FELD1B-A-mmH, exhibited an increase in the centroid m/z values >
0.3 m/z for the on-solution/off-beads condition compared to the on-beads/off-beads condition,
indicating that this segment was protected from full off-exchange by the binding of H4H2636P. The
centroid value differences greater than 0.3 m/z are highlighted in bold in Table 16. Therefore,
amino acids within this 15-24 region (SEQ ID NO: 412) based on the H/D exchange method include
an epitope for antibody H4H2636P binding to the Fel dlB-A-mmH protein.

Example 9. Generation of Bi-specific Antibodies
Description of the Fel d1l Bispecific Antibodies Produced
[0268] Bi-specific antibodies comprising heavy and light chain binding domains from pairs of
certain of the anti-Fel dl antibodies described in the present invention were constructed using
standard methodologies. The ant-Fel dl antibodies used to construct the bi-specific antibodies of
this example were obtained by immunizing a Veloclmmune@ mouse with a primary immunogen,
such as full length natural Fel dl, which may be purchased commercially (e.g., from Indoor
Biotechnologies, # LTN-FD1-1), or isolated from cat hair or dander by multi-step column
chromatography (See, for example, Chapman MD, et al. (1988), J. Immunol. 140:812-818), or
which may be produced recombinantly (See GenBank accession numbers P30438, or
NP_001041618.1 for the full length amino acid sequence of chain 1 of Fel dl (also referred to as
chain A or FELD1 A; also see SEQ ID NO: 392) and GenBank accession number P30440, or
NP_001041619.1 for the full length amino acid sequence of chain 2 of Fel dl (also referred to as
chain B or FELD B; also see SEQ ID NO: 393), or fragments of either chain 1 or chain 2, or
fragments from both chain 1 and chain 2 of the Fel dl protein, followed by immunization with a
secondary immunogen, or with an immunogenically active fragment of the natural protein. In one
embodiment, the immunogen used is exemplified in SEQ ID NO: 394 (in line fusion of Fel dl
Chain2 -Chain1-mFc) or SEQ ID NO: 395 (fusion of Fel dl Chain 1 using a linker and Chain 2
mFc).
[0269] The bi-specific antibodies produced in accordance with the present Example comprise two
antigen-binding domains (i.e. "binding arms 1 and 2").
[0270] One of the bi-specific antibodies, designated H4H3467D comprises a common kappa light
chain on both Fab arms, derived from the antibody H4H2864P (SEQ ID NO: 378). One Fab arm of
H4H3467D utilizes the heavy chain variable region           (VH)  from the antibody H4H2864P (SEQ ID NO:
370), while the other Fab arm utilizes the  VH    region from H4H1232N (SEQ ID NO: 18).
[0271] A second bi-specific antibody of the invention, designated H4H8751 D, comprises a
common kappa light chain on both Fab arms, derived from the antibody H4H2636P (SEQ ID NO:
                                                         73

314). One Fab arm of H4H8751D utilizes the     VH region from H4H2636P (SEQ ID NO: 306), while
the other Fab arm utilizes the VH  region from H4H1232N (SEQ ID NO: 18).

Biacore Analysis of Bi-specific Antibodies to Determine Association and Dissociation
Values
[0274] Binding association and dissociation rate constants (ka and kd, respectively), equilibrium
dissociation constants and dissociation half-lives (KD and t 1/2 , respectively) for natural Fel d 1
(subsequently referred to as nFel d 1) binding to purified anti-Fel d 1 monospecific and bispecific
antibodies were determined using a real-time surface plasmon resonance biosensor assay on a
Biacore 2000 instrument. On a CM5 chip, using the EDC-NHS chemistry, the Biacore sensor
surface was derivatized with a monoclonal mouse anti-human Fc antibody (GE, # BR-1008-39) to
capture anti-Fel d 1 monospecific and bispecific antibodies. All the Biacore binding studies were
performed at 250C in HBSP+ running buffer (0.01M HEPES pH 7.4, 0.15M NaCl, 3mM CaC12 , 3mM
MgCl 2 , 0.05% v/v Surfactant P20). Different concentrations of nFel d 1 (Indoor Biotech, # NA-FD1
2) (ranging from 600nM to 2.34nM, 6-fold dilutions) prepared in HBSP+ running buffer were
injected over the anti-Fel d 1 antibody captured surface at a flow rate of 50pL/min. Association of
nFel d 1 to the captured monoclonal antibodies was monitored for 4 minutes and the dissociation of
nFel d 1 in HBSP+ running buffer was monitored for 7 minutes. Kinetic association (ka) and
dissociation (kd) rate constants were determined by fitting the real-time sensorgrams to a 1:1
binding model with mass transport limitation using Scrubber 2.0c curve fitting software. Binding
dissociation equilibrium constants (KD) and dissociative half-lives (t1/2 ) were then calculated from
the kinetic rate constants as: KD (M) = kd / ka and ty, (min) = [In2/(60*kd)].

[0276] To determine the in vivo efficacy of the anti-Fel d 1 bi-specifics compared with their mono
specific parental antibodies, these antibodies along with an isotype control antibody were tested in
the PCA in vivo model using natural Fel d 1 for both sensitization and challenging, which was
previously described (see Example 6). Antibodies in this study were administered at a
concentration of 1mg/kg total antibody (0.5mg/kg of each antibody was used when two antibodies
were administered simultaneously) using 8 mice per experimental group. The data for each
experimental group expressed as percent reduction in dye extravasation  SD are shown in Table
20.
[0277] The mono-specific antibodies H4H1232N and H4H2864P caused a 67 ( 26)% and an 81
( 26)% reduction in dye extravasation, respectively. The combination of the mono-specific
antibodies, H4H1232N and H4H2864P, caused a 98 ( 3.5)% reduction in dye extravasation, while
the bi-specific, H4H3467D, composed of the mono-specific antibodies, H4H1232N and H4H2864P,
caused a 93 ( 11)% reduction in dye extravasation.
[0278] The mono-specific antibodies H4H1232N and H4H2636P caused a 64 ( 33)% and an 8.7
( 79)% reduction in dye extravasation, respectively, in another experiment. The combination of the
mono-specific antibodies, H4H1232N and H4H2636P, caused a 90 ( 15)% reduction in dye
extravasation, while the bi-specific, H4H8751 D, composed of the mono-specific antibodies,
H4H1232N and H4H2636P, caused a 77 ( 20)% reduction in dye extravasation.
