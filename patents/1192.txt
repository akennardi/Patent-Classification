               DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
[0019]           As used herein, card product refers to a card that may be used to transact business
with a party willing to accept the card, for example as tender for a purchase or discount for a
purchase.    As used herein, card product may also refer to a card used for promotional and/or
marketing purposes. Examples of such cards include credit cards, debit cards, gift cards, telephone
cards, loyalty cards, membership cards, ticket cards, entertainment cards, sports cards, prepaid
cards, discount cards, healthcare cards and the like. Typically, such cards are wallet-sized and
made of plastic. In various embodiments, the card product may be a type of card such as a gift or
prepaid card that requires activation at a point of sale.         For example, a card product may be
purchased and activated at a point of sale by a consumer and subsequently used by the consumer or
another (e.g., the recipient of the card as a gift) to transact business.
[0020]           Purchase of a card product may involve a card vendor, a redeeming merchant, and a
card issuer. In various embodiments, the card vendor, redeeming merchant and card issuer may be
the same, different, or related entities. The point of sale where the card is purchased and activated
                                                      4

is referred to herein as the card vendor or simply vendor. An entity that will accept the card for
business transactions, for example as tender for a purchase, is referred to as a redeeming merchant.
An entity that provides the financial backing and/or payment processing accessed via the card
product is referred to as the card issuer or simply issuer. Typically, the issuer is identified on the
card product and associates a unique issuer account code with each card product. Card issuers may
include direct issuers of cards such as store-branded cards, and in some embodiments the card
vendor may also be the card issuer and/or the redeeming merchant. Card issuers also may include
banks, financial institutions, and transaction processors such as VISA, Mastercard, American
Express, etc., and cards issued by such institutions may be readily accepted by a number of
redeeming merchants to conduct transactions such as purchases. Card issuers may be in various
industries, such as the entertainment, health, medical, pharmaceutical industries. For example, the
card issuer may be a pharmaceutical company utilizing cards and packages for pharmaceutical
products. In some instances, the redeeming merchant may be identified on the card product (for
example, a retailer branded card such as Store X), and such cards may be sold at the same or
different card vendor (e.g., card vendor is Store X or a different or unrelated Store Z). In such
instances, the Store X branded card product may be issued by Store X, by Store Z, or by a third
party such as bank or financial institution.
[0021]          The disclosed package may be used for display and sale of a card product. The
package generally comprises a first portion, a second portion foldably connected to the first
portion, and an optional third portion foldably connected to the first portion. The first portion may
have three panels, or optionally, four panels.      The second portion may have two panels, or
optionally, three panels. The third portion may have at least one panel. The first portion may have
a folded state where all panels are folded upon one another and an unfolded state where none of the
                                                  5

panels are folded upon another. The second portion may have a folded state where all panels are
folded upon one another and an unfolded state where none of the panels are folded upon another.
The first portion and second portion may have a closed position where the first portion and second
portion are folded upon one another, and the first portion and second portion may have an open
position where the first portion and second portion are not folded upon one another. The first,
second, and optional third portions may display information about the card product, including but
not limited to advertising, logos, warnings, disclaimers, agreements, marketing material, product
information, guidelines, rules, the like, or combinations thereof.
[0022]           FIG. 1 shows a perspective view of an embodiment of the disclosed system 1000
and package 500. The package 500 may comprise a first portion 100, a second portion 200
foldably connected to the first portion 100, a first fastener 14, and a second fastener 15.        The
system may comprise the package 500 and a card product 400 removably attached to the first
portion 100 of the package 500.
[0023]           The first portion 100 is shown in FIG. 1 in the unfolded state, the second portion
200 is shown in the unfolded state, and first portion 100 and second portion 200 are in the open
position. First portion 100 may have a first panel A connected to a second panel B via a first fold
line 1, and a third panel C may be connected to the second panel B via a second fold line 2.
Optionally, the first portion 100 may have a fourth panel D connected to the third panel C via a
third fold line 3. In FIG. 1, the second portion 200 is foldably connected to the first portion 100 via
fold line 4, and it is contemplated that embodiments of the disclosed system 1000 and package 500
may have second portion 200 foldably connected to the first portion 100 via other fold lines. The
second portion 200 may have a inner panel E connected to an outer panel F via fold line 5. In an
                                                   6

embodiment, the system 1000 may comprise a package 500 configured according to the disclosed
package embodiments, and a card product 400.
[0024]           The second portion 200 of the package 500 and system 1000 may comprise an inner
panel E foldably connected to the first portion 100, and an outer panel F foldably connected to a
side of the inner panel E opposite the first portion 100. In FIG. 1, the inner panel E may be
connected to the first panel A of the first portion 100 via fold line 4.
[0025]           The first fastener 14 and second fastener 15 are shown as reattachably separated
from one another in FIG. 1. In an embodiment, the second fastener 15 may be releasably attached
to first fastener 14 when the first portion 100 and the second portion 200 are in a closed position.
The first fastener 14 and second fastener 15 together may comprise a hook-and-loop fastener. In
an embodiment, the first fastener 14 and the second fastener 15 may differ in size. For example,
first fastener 14 may be larger than second fastener 15, or vice versa. In FIG. 1, the first fastener
 14 may be positioned on the first portion 100, and the second fastener 15 may be positioned on the
second portion 200. Particularly, the first fastener 14 may be positioned on the second panel B of
the first portion 100 adjacent the first fold line 1, and the second fastener 15 may be positioned on
the outer panel F of the second portion 200 on a side of the outer panel F opposite the inner panel
E. The dashed lines of the fasteners 14 and 15 indicate the fasteners are positioned on the face of
the panels F and B not viewable from the perspective shown in FIG. 1.
[0026]           The first panel A may include an opening 20, and the third panel C may include an
opening 10. Opening 20 may at least partially overlap opening 10 when the first portion 100 is in
the folded state. The card product 400 may have information recorded thereon, and information on
the card product 400 may be scannable or viewable through the openings 10 and/or 20 when the
first portion 100 is in the folded state. To be in the folded state, third panel C may be folded to
                                                    7

overlap the second panel B via second fold line 2 and the first panel A may be folded to overlap the
folded third panel C via the first fold line 1.
[0027]          The card product 400 may be attached to the right-most portion of the first portion
 100 of the package 500. In the embodiment of the invention shown in FIG. 1, the card product 400
may be attached to the fourth panel D via a means known in the art, for example, glue dots 13. The
card product 400 may partially overlap the fourth panel D and may extend rightward away from
the fourth panel D so as to expose a portion of the card product 400 to a magnetic reader (not
shown), which reads a magnetic strip 40 disposed on the card product 400.
[0028]          Third panel C typically may include a "sombrero" 8 or hanger opening through
which a peg may extend in order to support the paperboard package, for example, in a retail
display. As shown in FIG. 1, panels A, B, D, E, and F may also include sombreros 8 so that, upon
folding completely, the sombreros overlap one another and allow a peg to extend through the
completely folded system 1000. In other embodiments, one or more of panels of the first and
second portions 100 and 200 may have a height less than a height of the panel which includes the
sombrero, so as to avoid manufacturing sombreros into every panel of package 500 of system
 1000. In one non-limiting embodiment, the sombreros are sized so as to put forth a smaller
sombrero for viewing by a potential customer while the package is hanging on a peg and to
partially hide interior sombreros from view by making the interior sombreros larger than the
exterior-most sombrero.
[0029]          The first panel A of the first portion 100 may include tabs 12, bounded in part, by
perforated portions of the first panel A. The tabs 12 may extend to an edge of the first panel A
opposite of the first fold line 1. Third panel C may include elongated slots 11. The slots 11 may
                                                    8

be positioned in a direction perpendicular to the second fold line 2. The slots 11 may overlap one
or more of tabs 12.
[0030]          In an embodiment, the card product 400 may include a barcode 50 and a magnetic
portion 40, such as a magnetic strip, and both the barcode 50 and the magnetic portion 40 may
include recorded information. The barcode 50 may be scannable through the openings 10 and 20
when the first portion 100 is in the folded state.     In an embodiment, the barcode 50 may be
scannable through the openings 10 and 20 when the first portion 100 and second portion 200 are in
the closed position. In an alternative embodiment, the card product 400 may include an entry code
(not shown) and a magnetic portion 40, and the magnetic portion 40 may include recorded
information.   The entry code may be viewable through the openings 10 and 20 when the first
portion 100 is in the folded state; moreover, the entry code may be viewable through the openings
 10 and 20 when the first portion 100 and second portion 200 are in the closed position.
[0031]          In an embodiment, a face of the outer panel F of the second portion 200 may be
releasably attached with an adhesive 13 to a face of the inner panel E of the second portion 200
when the second portion 200 is in the folded state. In FIG. 1, adhesive 13 is shown as placed on
inner panel E of the second portion.
[0032]          Third panel C typically includes two elongated slots 11 through which tabs 12
disposed on first panel A may be tucked when the first portion 100 is in the folded state so as to
maintain the first portion 100 in a folded state even after the perforated portions on first panel A
are torn away from the majority portion of first panel A. In other words, the first portion 100 may
be maintained in a folded state after opening by using tabs 12 on panel D inasmuch as the tabs 12
can be tucked into the elongated slots 11 on third panel C.
                                                  9

[0033]          In an embodiment, a booklet 70 may be connected to or releasably attached to the
first portion 100 or second portion 200.         The booklet 70 may comprise a contract, license
agreement, instructions, folded terms, marketing materials, advertising materials, or combinations
thereof, for example. As shown in FIG. 1, the booklet 70 may be attached to the interior surface of
second panel B via one or more glue dots 13. Various adhesives or other conventional bonding
techniques may be used to attach the booklet 70 to the interior side of second panel B.            In
accordance with the disclosed embodiments, it is contemplated the booklet 70 may be attached to
any of the fold lines of the package 500 by methods known in the art.
[0034]          In an embodiment, the outer panel F of the second portion 200 may have a width
smaller than a width of the inner panel E of the second portion 200. In an embodiment, fourth
panel D of the first portion 100 is shown in FIG. I to be smaller than the panels A-C. In alternative
embodiments, other sizes of panels are possible. Furthermore, it is not necessary for the openings
 10 and 20 to be identically sized. Rather, as discussed above regarding the sombreros 8, it is
possible to size one of the openings 10 or 20 smaller than the other, such as for example, opening
20, so that the opening 10 will not unattractively overlap the opening 20 and expose an edge to a
viewer when the first portion 100 is in the folded state.
[0035]          As used herein, "completely folded" refers to when any of the first portion, second
portion, and optional third portion are in the folded state; when any combination of the first
portion, second portion, and optional third portion are in the folded state; when the first portion,
second portion, and optional third portion are in the closed position; or combinations thereof.
[0036]          In the folded state of the first portion 100 shown in FIG. 1, fourth panel D of the
first portion 100 may be folded to overlap the third panel C via third fold line 3, third panel C may
be folded to overlap the second panel B via the second fold line 2, and first panel A may be folded
                                                   10

to overlap the third panel C via the first fold line 1. In this state, opening 20 may at least partially
overlap opening 10. In embodiments with an optional fourth panel D, the fourth panel D may fold
about third panel C via fold line 3 such that a barcode 50 disposed on the card 400 aligns with
opening 10 formed in third panel C. Thus, fourth panel D may be folded against third panel C, and
the card product 400 may be partially exposed through the opening 10.
[0037]           In the folded state of the second portion 200, outer panel F may fold about inner
panel E via fold line 5.
[0038]           In the closed position, the first portion 100 in the folded state and the second
portion 200 in the folded state fold against one another via fold line 4. In FIG. 1, the second
portion 200 is shown as connected to the first portion 100 via fold line 4; however, it is
contemplated second portion 200 may be connected to the first portion 100 via other fold lines,
e.g., fold line 1, fold line 2, fold line 3, and the like.
[0039]           Various decorative or informative designs may be printed on individual panels of
the first portion 100, second portion 200, optional third portion 300, or combinations thereof. For
example, pricing information or other instructions regarding use of the card product 400 may be
displayed on the exterior surface of second panel B. Alternatively, or in addition to a display on
second panel B, the exterior face of first panel A may include attractive advertising designs.
[0040]           The system 1000 and package 500 are designed for display and easy activation of
the card product 400. One application of this embodiment includes the containment of secure open
loop prepaid cards displayed in a retail environment. In embodiments wherein the card product
400 requires activation, the disclosed system 1000 and package 500 present two methods for
accessing the card product 400, i.e. a dual-method access scheme.
                                                       11

[0041]          A first method for accessing the card product 400 may be via scanning a barcode 50
on the card product 400. The barcode 50 may be accessible through openings 10 and 20. Openings
 10 and 20 may be die cut. The openings 10 and 20 may be aligned and oriented in such a way that
the card product 400 can be scanned and activated while still securely held inside the package 500.
This provides for a fast and easy checkout experience. In an embodiment where the openings 10
and 20 reveal the card product 400 when the portions of the system 1000 and package 500 are in
the closed position, the bar code 50 may be scanned without disturbing the completely folded
position of the package 500. In an alternative embodiment where unfolding of the portions must
occur to reveal the card product 400, a method to access the card product 400 may involve
reattachably separating the first fastener 14 and the second fastener 15 by unfolding the first
portion 100, second portion 200, and/or optional third portion 300 from the closed position to the
open position.    In an embodiment where the second portion 200 or optional third portion 300
obstructs any of the openings 10 or 20, an additional step may include unfolding the second portion
200 or optional third portion 300 so that card product 400 is revealed through the first portion 100.
In the above-discussed method steps, the portions 100, 200, and optional 300 may remain in the
folded state during activation of the card product 400.
[0042]          A second method of accessing the card product 400 generally may include opening
the package 500 from the closed position to the open position. The method to access and activate
the card product 400 involves:
        1) releasably separating the first fastener 14 and the second fastener 15 by unfolding the
        first portion 100, second portion 200, and/or optional third portion 300 from the closed
        position to the open position;
        2) untucking the tabs 12 from the elongated slots 11 of the first portion 100;
                                                  12

         3) unfolding the panels (A-C, and optional D) of the first portion 100 from the folded state
         to the unfolded state; and
         4) revealing the card product 400, being releasably attached to a panel (e.g., third panel C
         or fourth panel D) of the first portion 100 of the package 500.
The package 500 may be returned to the folded state by folding the panels (A-C, optionally D) of
the first portion 100 to return the first portion 100 to the folded state, and resealing the first portion
 100 via tabs 12 of the first panel A in the elongated slots 11 of the third panel C.
[0043]            The embodiments of the package and system shown herein provide a solution for
retail outlets that activate cards by either barcode or magnetic strip, thereby eliminating the need
for maintaining an inventory of multiple package types. This embodiment also provides tamper
evidence. By keeping the card securely glued to a package's panel up to, and through the process of
activation, it is extremely difficult to compromise the package and remove the card without making
the removal obvious and evident. Various glues may be used, and the package itself may be made
of paper, cardboard, tagboard, plastic, or foil, for example.
[0044]            In embodiments, a security code may be included on the card product 400. The
security code may be used in addition or in lieu of the magnetic strip 40 and barcode 50. The
security code may also serve a secondary or dual purpose, such as encoding information useful for
purchase and/or activation of the card product. For example, the dual purpose security code may
comprise a unique bar code that may be scanned at a point of sale terminal to purchase and/or
activate the card product. An example of such a unique bar code is an EAN/UCC-128 bar code,
containing both a vendor product identification portion and an issuer account portion.                The
EAN/UCC-128 bar code may be used to activate the card via a one-step process.
                                                    13

[0045]          In embodiments wherein the card product 400 requires activation, the disclosed
system 1000 and package 500 present multiple methods for activation, i.e. a multi-method
activation scheme. Methods for activating the card product 400 may include scanning the barcode
50, swiping the magnetic strip 40 of the card product 400, entering or scanning the security code,
or combinations thereof. In embodiments where the method for activating the card product 400
comprises a one-step activation method, the one step comprises simultaneously entering the
combination vendor product identification and issuer account code at a point of sale terminal. The
one-step process only requires a single entry by a clerk operating the point of sale terminal to
activate the card product. For example, the one step may be performed at the point of sale terminal
by scanning the bar code 50, for example an EAN/UCC-128 bar code, containing both a vendor
product identification portion and an issuer account portion. The vendor product identification
portion may be used to perform a look-up to determine product identity and price. The issuer
account portion may be used to activate the particular account associated with the card product
such that the card may be used to transact business with the issuer of the card. Upon being entered
at the point of sale terminal, the issuer account code may be conveyed (for example, via a
computer network) to the issuer or other third party processor responsible for looking up the
account code (for example, via a database reconciliation) and activating same.         In alternative
embodiment, the one step may be performed at the point of sale terminal by swiping the magnetic
strip 40 containing both a vendor product identification portion and an issuer account portion.
[0046]          Package assembly embodiments as described herein may be manufactured
according to various methods known in the art. For example, card products and packages can be
manufactured and printed and subsequently placed in a printed rack hanger, or alternatively the
card product and package can be made concurrently, for example via coextrusion of a plastic sheet
                                                  14

with subsequent printing and placed in a printed rack hanger. Where made of a plastic or polymer,
the type of material may be selected to provide appropriate functional characteristics such as
printability, gloss, the ability to snap and break along a perforation, the like, or combinations
thereof. In some embodiment, security codes may be applied to prefabricated package assemblies
via stickers spanning the card product and the card holder. Alternative methods of making the
various embodiments disclosed herein will be apparent to those skilled in the art.
[0047]          One benefit of the above-noted arrangement is that the card product 400 may be
scanned via a barcode reader when the first portion 100 is completely folded in the folded state,
and the card product 400 may be magnetically scanned as with a magnetic strip reader when the
card product 400 is still attached to the first portion 100. Additionally, first portion 100 may be
unfolded and refolded to the folded state without removing the card product 400, once the card
product 400 is scanned via a magnetic card reader.
[0048]          FIG. 2 shows a perspective view of an alternative embodiment of the system and
package shown in FIG. 1. The system 2000 and package 2500 shown in FIG. 2 may have three
panels A-C in the first portion 100. In such an embodiment, the card product 400 may be attached
to third panel C. In embodiments, the card product 400 may be attached to third panel C via one or
more glue dots 13. The glue dots 13 may be made with a semi-permanent gel, rubber cement, or
wax in order to allow a user to easily remove the card product 400 without damaging it. The fold
lines 1-5 may be made via perforation or scoring, for example. Other methods are available.
[0049]          FIG. 3 shows a perspective view of an embodiment of the disclosed system 3000

[0052]          The first fastener 14 may be attached to the panel H of the third portion 300, and the
second fastener 15 may be attached to the inner panel E of the second portion 200.                  In
embodiments of the disclosed system and package which do not include a third portion, the first
fastener 14 may be attached to the first portion 100.
[0053]          The first portion 100 of package 3500 and system 3000 may fold from the unfolded
state to the folded state in the same manner as described for the first portion 100 of the package
500 and system 1000 of FIG. 1.
[0054]          The second portion 200 may fold from the unfolded state to the folded state. In the
folded state of the second portion 200 of system 3000 and package 3500, outer panel G may fold
about intermediate panel F via fold line 6, intermediate panel F may fold about inner panel E via
                                                   16

[0055]          The third portion 300 shown in FIG. 3 is a single panel H; however, it is
contemplated the third portion 300 may comprise two or more panels which may be folded to a
folded state in schemes similar to those disclosed for the first and second portions 100 and 200.
[0056]          The package 3500 and system 3000 may fold to the closed position when the first
portion 100, second portion 200, and third portion 300 are in the folded state. The first portion 100
may be folded into the folded state in the direction of the arrows shown in FIG. 3 and according to
the folding scheme disclosed above for the first portion 100. Once the first portion 100 is in the
folded state, the second portion 200 may be folded to the folded state; or the second portion 200
may be folded to the folded state before the first portion 100. The second portion 200 may be
folded to the folded state in the direction of the arrows shown in FIG. 3. Once the first and second
portions 100 and 200 are in the folded state, panel H of third portion 300 may be then folded about
panel E of the second portion 200 via fold line 1 so that first and second fasteners 14 and 15 may
releasably attach. In FIG. 3, fasteners 14 and 15 may have a different size. For example, in FIG. 3,

(e.g., the bar code 50) may be visible through opening 10. The panels A, E, F, and G may be
folded in the direction of the arrows so the first portion 100 and second portion 200 are in the
folded state.
[0063]          FIG. 6b shows a perspective view of the system 6000 and package 6500 of FIG. 6a
with the first portion 100 and the second portion 200 in the folded state, or completely folded. To
completely fold the first portion 100 of the system 6000 and package 6500 to the folded state, first
panel A may fold against folded third panel C along fold line 1, and after folding of the first
portion 100 is complete, only first panel A may be visible from one side, and only second panel B
may be visible from the opposite side. A portion of the card product 400 (e.g., the bar code 50)
may be visible through opening 20 and the opening 10 when the first portion 100 and the second
portion 200 of the package 6500 are completely folded in the closed position. The opening 20 in
the first panel A may substantially overlap opening 10 in panel C when the first portion 100 is in
the folded state. The term substantially overlap means that a majority of one opening is overlapped
by the other opening such that the majority of the opening faces the area on the opposite side of the
panel that defines the other opening. Thus, the information disposed on the card product 400, such
as a barcode 50, may be scannable from the card product 400 even when the first and second
portions 100 and 200 of the package 6500 are in a closed position. To completely fold the second
                                                   19

portion 200 of the system 6000 and package 6500 to the folded state, outer panel G may be folded
about intermediate panel F via fold line 5, and intermediate panel F may then be folded about inner
panel E via fold line 4 so that outer panel G is between the intermediate panel F and inner panel E,
as shown in FIG. 6b. In FIG. 6b, fastener 15 can be seen on intermediate panel F of the second
portion 200, and fastener 14 can be seen on first panel A of the first portion 100. To fold the
system 6000 and package 6500 to the closed position, second portion 200 may be folded about the
first portion 100 in the direction of the arrows shown in FIG. 6b
[0064]          FIG. 6c shows a side elevational view of the system 6000 and package 6500 of
FIGS. 6a and 6b, with the first portion 100 and second portion 200 in the closed position. In the
closed position, first panel A of the first portion 100 may fold against intermediate panel F of the
second portion 200. The first portion 100 may fold against the second portion 200 via fold line 1.
The first fastener 14 is shown releasably attached to the second fastener 15. In FIG. 6c, fasteners
 14 and 15 are shown of differing sizes, and fastener 15 is larger than fastener 14. The first portion
 100 may comprise a recessed area 22 in one or more of the panels.           The fastener 14 may be
positioned in the recessed area 22 of the first portion. The second portion 200 may comprise a
recessed area 24 in one or more of the panels. The fastener 15 may be positioned in the recessed
area 24 of the second portion 200. The fasteners 14 and 15 may comprise a hook-and-loop type
fastener which may be easily releasably attached.
[0065]          The fasteners 14 and 15 enable the system 6000 and package 6500 to be opened
and closed many times without comprising the integrity thereof. For example, a user (e.g., a
customer) may see information displayed on the first and/or second portions 100 and 200 regarding
the card product 400, and the user may choose to know more about the card product 400. The user
may open the disclosed system 6000 and package 6500 and unfold the panels of the second
                                                   20

portion, and view any information on the panels and the optional booklet that may be included in
the system 6000 and package 6500. If the user chooses to keep (e.g., purchase) the card product
400 contained in the system 6000, the system 6000 allows two method for access of the card
product 400 and at least two methods for activation of the card product 400. The user may choose
not to purchase the card product 400, and the first and second portions 100 and 200 of the system
6000 may be folded in the folded state and subsequently to the closed position. The user may then
return the system 6000 to a display or person, and the system 6000 may be ready for viewing by
another user without experiencing any loss of function or compromised integrity.
[0066]          FIG. 7 shows a perspective view of an embodiment of the disclosed package 7500.
Package 7500 may be used with a card product; although a card product is not shown in FIG. 7. In
