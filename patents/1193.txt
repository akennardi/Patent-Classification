Hitherto known gratings for covering shafts, channels or similar structures comprise peripheral rails
cross-bars that are joined to the peripheral rails and consist of sheet metal sections, and longitudinal
bars joined to the cross-bars. In order to provide a better foothold and improved anti-skid
properties, the longitudinal bars are secured to the cross-bars in such a way that top stepping
surfaces of the longitudinal bars are lower than or flush with at least stepping portions of upper
edges of the cross-bars.

                                          Description
The invention relates to a grating according to the preamble of Claim 1.
Gratings are used for covering openings in surfaces that are to be walked on and/or driven
on. A large proportion of such structures form drainage channels or shafts which are used
for surface drainage. Such gratings must, on the one hand, be stable and, on the other hand,
provide adequate drainage capacity. Additional significant aspects include price and weight.
Another significant aspect for gratings lying in surfaces walked on by pedestrians is slip
resistance. Issues often arise particularly when, for reasons of cost and weight reduction,
such gratings are made of sheet metal material.
A grating is known from DE 1 856 722 U, in which bars which cross over one another and
are made of sheet metal material have edges that are formed serrated in order to thus afford
greater slip resistance. The loading capacity of such gratings is limited.
Gratings are known from DE 1 659 147 A or DE 1 966 875 U, in which longitudinal bars with
a U-shaped cross section are mounted by means of their shanks in slots which are located
in cross-bars. The longitudinal bars project over the cross-bars. Such gratings do not provide
sufficient slip resistance.
The object of the invention is to further develop a grating of the type mentioned at the outset
so as to provide improved slip resistance with a simple construction.
This object is achieved by means of a grating according to Claim 1.
In particular, this object is achieved by means of a grating for covering shafts, channels
or similar structures, comprising peripheral rails, cross-bars made of sheet metal
sections which are connected to the peripheral rails and longitudinal bars which are
connected to the cross-bars. The longitudinal bars are attached to the cross-bars in
such a way that upper stepping surfaces of the longitudinal bars extend lower than or
flush with at least stepping sections of upper edges of the cross-bars. This very simple
construction ensures that the stepping sections of the cross-bars, which are in turn
made from sheet metal sections, form a non-slip surface, with the longitudinal bars in
turn being able to be formed such that there is no risk of becoming caught (e.g. with
narrow heels).

   WO 2015/117932                                                             PCT/EP2015/052124
                                                  2
The longitudinal bars preferably have essentially U-shaped cross-sections, with their
shanks being fixed in the cross-bars. This ensures a high level of stability while
increasing the above-mentioned safety against narrow heels becoming caught.
The peripheral rails preferably have slots into which ends of the cross-bars are inserted.
This permits a simple yet stable installation. In particular, the peripheral rails are formed
as a sheet metal hollow profile, which saves on material and weight, but which is
nevertheless very stable.
The cross-bars have slots for receiving the shanks of the longitudinal bars, with these slots
being formed such that the shanks can be inserted into these slots. Here too, a high level of
stability is obtained by means of simple constructive measures. The ends of the cross-bars
are preferably bent inside the peripheral rails in such a way that the cross-bars are fixed to
the peripheral rails. A stable fixing can thus be produced by means of a deformation only,
and welding is not required.
The cross-bars preferably have stop sections situated before their ends so that the ends can
be inserted into the peripheral rails up to a defined insertion depth. An exact shape and
dimensioning are thus obtained.
The peripheral rails preferably have bearing surfaces for bearing on corresponding sections
of the structures, and lower edges of the ends of the cross-bars are formed such that they
bear on the inner surfaces of the bearing surfaces. This results in a high load stability.
The stepping sections of the cross-bars have sharp-edged engagement edges opposite
rounded transition areas between the shanks and the stepping surfaces of the longitudinal
bars. These engagement edges are of course not so sharp-edged that injury or damage is
caused to persons (or bicycle tires), nevertheless they are ,,sufficiently angular" to guarantee
improved slip resistance.
Brackets are preferably provided which, for the purpose of fixing the grating in the structure,
are connected to the peripheral rails. This ensures a simple yet sufficiently stable installation
of the grating on a structure. The brackets preferably have upper spring sections, by means
of which they can be inserted under tension into openings of the peripheral rails and can be
fixed in the peripheral rails, preferably in a form fitting manner. The assembly is thus very
simple.
The peripheral rails additionally have rod elements projecting downwards, which are formed
for insertion into corresponding recesses in the structure and for prevention of a longitudinal
displacement of the grating relative to the structure. These rod elements can thus be very

                                                 3
easily produced.
The peripheral rails have access openings on the outside such that the ends of the cross
bars can be accessed from the outside by tools for connection of the cross-bars to the
peripheral rails. This simple constructive measure thus allows the gratings to be produced
very easily.

                    according to Figs. 1-5, and
Fig. 7              shows a depiction similar to that of Fig. 5, wherein one of the peripheral
                    rails and several of the longitudinal bars and cross-bars are omitted to
                    allow a better understanding of the construction.
In the following description, similar parts and parts with similar functions are designated with
the same reference numerals.
As can be seen from the figures, peripheral rails 10, 10' are provided, which are connected
to one another by means of cross-bars 20. The cross-bars 20 have ends 23, 23', which are
inserted into slots 11 of the peripheral rails 10, 10'.
The cross-bars 20 in turn have slots 24, into which shanks 32, 32' of longitudinal bars 30
are pressed, which longitudinal bars have a U-shaped cross-section (such as an
inverted U).
Between two of these longitudinal bars 30, stepping sections 21, which are sections of the

   WO 2015/117932                                                               PCT/EP2015/052124
                                                  4
upper edge 22 of each cross-bar, project over upper stepping surfaces 31 of the longitudinal
bars, as can be seen in particular in Fig. 4. This ensures that the cross-bars 20 or their upper
edges 22 form, together with the stepping sections 21, a grating surface which is very slip
resistant. On the other hand, the longitudinal bars 30 or their upper stepping surfaces 31
ensure that, even with very narrow heels, it is almost impossible to "break through" into the
drainage openings.
The cross-bars 20 additionally have engagement edges 27 on the stepping sections 21
which each project upwards between two longitudinal bars, which engagement edges still
have an anti-slip effect even when the stepping sections 21 extend essentially flush with the
upper stepping surfaces 31 of the longitudinal bars 30 because the shanks 32, 32' are
rounded in their transition areas 33, 33' to the upper stepping surface 31, and a certain
cavity is thus formed which a flexible shoe sole can enter into and "become caught" on the
engagement edges 27.
As already mentioned previously, the ends 23, 23' of the cross-bars 20 are inserted into the
slots 11 of the peripheral rails 10, 10'. These peripheral rails 10, 10' are in turn bent in the
form of partially closed hollow bodies in such a way that a lower bearing surface 12 is
formed, by means of which the peripheral rails 10, 10' bear on the structure (on a frame
thereon). Inner surfaces 13 are formed opposite these bearing surfaces 12 on the inside of
the peripheral rails 10, 10' on which, in turn, lower edges 26 of the cross-bars 20 or their
ends 23, 23' bear in the mounted state. This ensures maximum stability.
The peripheral rails 10, 10' have access openings 16, 16' on the outside, by means of which
the ends 23, 23' of the cross-bars 20 can be bent using a tool in such a way that the cross
bars 20 are fixed in the peripheral rails 10, 10'. It is also helpful that the cross-bars 20 have
stop sections 25, by means of which the cross-bars 10, 10' stand up on the edges of the
slots 11, so that when the ends 23, 23' are bent a shake-free accommodation of the cross
bars 20 in the peripheral rails 10, 10' is ensured.
In addition, the peripheral rails 10, 10' have openings 14 (see Fig. 7), into which brackets 40
with upper spring sections 41 can be inserted, each of which has an engagement projection
43. The engagement projection 43 is inserted into corresponding recesses of the peripheral
rails 10, 10', so that the brackets 40 can be inserted into the peripheral rails 10, 10' or their
opening 14, and levered in until they snap into place there.
In the mounted position a clamping section 42 then projects downwards from the peripheral
rail 10, 10', which clamping section is formed such that it becomes caught either on a wall of
the structure or in an opening provided therein and fixes the grating to the structure.

                                                  5
The peripheral rails 10, 10' additionally have rod elements 15, see Figs. 2, 3 and 4,
which engage in corresponding recesses of the structure so that a longitudinal
displacement of the grating on the structure can be reliably prevented.
