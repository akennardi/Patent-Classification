1181    An example of a compound of Formula I is anatabine. The chemical structure of
         anatabine (1,2,3,6-tetrahydro-[2,3']bipyridinyl) is illustrated below, in which *

[20] An example of a compound of Formula IA is S-(-)-anatabine. In some embodiments
     anatabine is provided in the form of a pharmaceutically acceptable (or food grade) salt
     of anatabine. Anatabine may be adsorbed on a cation exchange resin such as
     polymethacrilic acid (Amberlite IRP64 or Purolite Cl 15HMR), as described in U.S.
     Patent 3,901,248, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its
     entirety. Such cation exchange resins have been used commercially, for example, in
     nicotine replacement therapy, e.g., nicotine polacrilex.
[211 Unless otherwise clear from context, the term "anatabine" as used herein refers
     collectively to anatabine, either as a racemic mixture or an enantiomer, and
     pharmaceutically acceptable or food-grade salts of either of them. In general, salts
     may provide improved chemical purity, stability, solubility, and/or bioavailability
     relative to anatabine in its native form. Non-limiting examples of possible anatabine
     salts are described in P. H. Stahl et al., Handbook ofPharmaceuticalSalts:
     Properties,Selection and Use, Weinheim/Znrich:Wiley-VCH/VHCA, 2002, including
     salts of 1-hydroxy-2-naphthoic acid, 2,2-dichloroacetic acid, 2-hydroxyethanesulfonic

      undecylenic acid.
[22]  As an alternative to preparing anatabine synthetically, anatabine can be obtained by
      extraction from tobacco or other plants, such as members of the Solanaceae family,
      such as datura, mandrake, belladonna, capsicum, potato, nicotiana, eggplant, and
      petunia. For example, a tobacco extract may be prepared from cured tobacco stems,
      lamina, or both. In the extraction process, cured tobacco material is extracted with a
      solvent, typically water, ethanol, steam, or carbon dioxide. The resulting solution
      contains the soluble components of the tobacco, including anatabine. Anatabine may
      be purified from the other components of the tobacco using suitable techniques such
      as liquid chromatography.
1231  As part of the purification process, tobacco material may be substantially
      denicotinized to remove a majority of other alkaloids such as nicotine, nornicotine,
      and anabasine. Denicotinizing is usually carried out prior to extraction of anatabine.
      Methods that may be used for denicotinizing tobacco materials are described, for
      example, in U.S. Patent 5,119,835, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by
      reference. In general, tobacco alkaloids may be extracted from tobacco material with
      carbon dioxide under supercritical conditions. The tobacco alkaloids may then be
       separated from the carbon dioxide by dissolving an organic acid or a salt thereof, such
       as potassium monocitrate, in the carbon dioxide.
 [24]  In some aspects, an isolated form of anatabine is used. An "isolated form of
       anatabine," as used herein, refers to anatabine that either has been prepared
       synthetically or has been substantially separated from plant materials in which it
       occurs naturally. The isolated form of anatabine should have a very high purity
       (including enantiomeric purity in the case where an enantiomer is used). In the case of
       synthetic anatabine, for example, purity refers to the ratio of the weight of anatabine
       to the weight of the end reaction product. In the case of isolating anatabine from plant
       material, for example, purity refers to the ratio of the weight of anatabine to the total
       weight of the anatabine-containing extract. Usually, the level of purity is at least about
       95%, more usually at least about 96%, about 97%, about 98%, or higher. For
                                                 6

      example, the level of purity may be about 98.5%, 99.0%, 99.1%, 99.2%, 99.3%,
      99.4%, 99.5%, 99.6%, 99.7%, 99.8%, 99.9%, or higher.
[251  In some embodiments, products (e.g., pharmaceutical compositions and dietary
      supplements) comprise synthetic anatabine. In some embodiments, products (e.g.,
      pharmaceutical compositions and dietary supplements) comprise naturally occurring
      anatabine (i.e., anatabine extracted from a plant, as described in more detail below).

      EXAMPLE 1
      NFiB-mediated transcription assays; Cytotoxicity assays
 [39] The effect of a range of doses of anatabine, nicotine, crude extract of smokeless
       tobacco, and alkaloid extract of smokeless tobacco was examined in an NFKB
       luciferase assay (inhibition of TNFa-induced NFKB activity). The smokeless tobacco
       used in these experiments was plain long-leaf Copenhagen tobacco purchased from a
       local vendor. Crude extract was extracted with methanol and water and clarified by
       centrifugation and filtration. The alkaloid extract was prepared from sodium
       hydroxide and methanol extraction, organic phase separation and purification. All
       treatment samples were prepared as a function of weight (pg/ml), and all samples
       were diluted in DMSO. Dilutions were made immediately before cell culture
       treatments and, in all cases, the final amount of DMSO did not exceed 1%in cell
       culture media.
 [40]  Human endothelial kidney cells (HEK293) transfected with an NFKB luciferase
       reporter were challenged with TNFa for three hours, then samples were applied to the
       challenged cells. The results are shown in FIGS. 1-3.
 1411  Cytotoxicity assays using the supernatants from the treated cells were conducted
       using an LDH Cytotoxicity Detection Kit (Roche) according to the manufacturer's
       instructions. The results are shown in FIGS. 4-6.
                                                10

[42]  As shown in FIG. 1, TNFa induces an increase in NFKB-mediated transcription of
      luciferase; administration of anatabine can reduce this transcription to control levels
      without cellular toxicity (FIG. 4). Crude extracts of smokeless tobacco, while not
      toxic to cells (FIG. 5), do not reduce TNFa-induced NFKB-mediated transcription
      (FIG. 2). Although not suitable for administration as pharmaceuticals, both nicotine
      and an alkaloid extract of smokeless tobacco reduce TNFa-induced NFKB-mediated
      transcription (FIG. 3); at higher doses, the alkaloid extract demonstrates pronounced
      cytotoxicity (FIG. 6).
       EXAMPLE 2
       Effects of Anatabine, CELEBREX@, and Aspirin on LPS-Induced NFKB
       Activity in Human White Blood Cells
[431   Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated using the Ficoll plaque method
       according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cells were activated with LPS 10
       pg/ml and treated with 1.25 mM anatabine, celecoxib (CELEBREX@), or aspirin.
       Cells were then incubated at 37 "C and 5% CO 2 overnight (18 hours) in RPMI
       medium supplemented with 20 mg/ml PHA, 1%penicillin/streptomycin, and 1%
       glutamax and assayed to detect NFKB activity. The results are shown in FIG. 7.
       EXAMPLE 3
       Effects of Increasing Concentrations of Anatabine on IL-1p Release from
       Human Blood Cells
 [441  Stimulation of human blood cells with LPS causes release of interleukin 13 (IL-1p).
       Anatabine inhibits this release in a concentration-dependent manner, as shown in
       FIG. 8. FIG. 9 is a graph demonstrating this inhibition over time.
       EXAMPLE 4
       Effects of Anatabine, Aspirin, Ibuprofen, Celecoxib, and Diclofenac on IL-10
       Accumulation After Treatment of Whole Human Blood With LPS
 [451   Whole human blood was treated with LPS (to stimulate IL- 13 production) and either
        anatabine, aspirin, ibuprofen, celecoxib, or diclofenac. After 16 hours, IL-1p release
       was measured. The results are shown in FIG. 10 and demonstrate a reduced
                                                11

     accumulation of IL-13 in anatabine-treated blood compared with blood treated with
     other anti-inflammatory agents.
