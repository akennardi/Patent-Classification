   Field of the Invention
        The present invention relates generally to gaming
   systems, and particularly but not exclusively to a
20 mechanical reel and a reel strip having at least one
   offset symbol bearing surface.
   Background of the Invention
25      Slot machines, otherwise known as fruit machines and
   poker machines typically have three or more reels which
   spin when a button is pushed.   Each reel typically has
   printed on its outer surface a plurality of symbols.                    Each
   of the mechanical reels typically revolve and then stop to
30 display a symbol.  At full speed the reels may typically
   spin on the order of 100 revolutions per minute.              At this
   speed it can be difficult to spot a symbol, such as a key
   or chaser symbol.
35      While gaming systems provide players with enjoyment,
   a need exists for alternative gaming systems in order to
   maintain or increase player enjoyment.

   Detailed Description of embodiments of the invention
30       Figure 1 shows a perspective view of a gaming system
   in the form of a stand alone gaming machine 10.             The
   gaming machine 10 includes a console 12 having a plurality
   of mechanical reels such as 16 that can be played by a
   player.   Figure 2 shows a perspective view of one
35 embodiment of a strip of looped material forming a reel
   strip generally indicated by the numeral 40.         In use, the
   strip is disposed on at least one of the mechanical reels
                                             9889016_1 (GHMatters) P84462.AU.3 18/01/18

                                5
   32 used in the gaming system shown in Figure 1. The reel
   strip 40 has a circumferential reel strip surface 42, and
   an at least one symbol bearing surface 44 offset from the
   reel strip surface.  The reel strip has, in this but
 5 necessarily in all embodiments, a plurality of symbols. At
   least one of the plurality of symbols is disposed on the
   symbol bearing surface and the remainder of the symbols
   are disposed on the reel strip surface.  The offset is
   such that the symbol bearing surface is conspicuous with
10 respect to the reel surface to a player of the gaming
   system 10, although it need not be in all embodiments. In
   the embodiment of Figure 2, the symbol bearing surface is
   spaced outwardly from the reel surface by an element 56,
   but it need not in all embodiments.  In this embodiment,
15 the symbol bearing surface has a star shaped perimeter,
   but the perimeter does not need to be any particular
   shape.
        An embodiment of a mechanical reel provides a unique
20 look in comparison to the prior art. Having a chaser
   symbol, for example, offset from the reel surface may make
   it easier for a player to keep track of the passing
   symbol. This may maintain or increase player enjoyment.
   Some embodiments add a third dimension to an otherwise
25 flat reel, in order to make a symbol literally stand out.
        Figure 3 shows a perspective view of a mechanical
   reel 32 of the gaming system 10 of Figure 1 with the reel
   strip of Figure 2 disposed thereon.
30
        When the reel strip is so disposed on the reel 32,
   there is provided a mechanical reel having a
   circumferential reel surface 48, which is the surface 42
   of the strip, and an at least one symbol bearing surface
35 50 offset from the reel surface 48.  The symbol bearing
   surface 50, in this embodiment, is that of the strip 44.
   In the embodiment of Figure 3, the reel body 52 has a
                                            9889016_1 (GHMatters) P84462.AU.3 18/01/18

                                6
   central aperture 54 for mounting of the reel 32 on an axle
   for imparting a rotational motion to the reel.
        The reel strip may be formed of any combination of
 5 laminated layers of paper, plastic, and printed film
   paper, for example.  Generally, any suitable material may
   be used and construction employed. The strips may have
   silk screen art, such as the symbols.  The silk screened
   symbols may control light that illuminates the symbol from
10 behind.  The strip may include at least a transparent
   portion, or other means to make the symbol stand out.
        Figure 4 shows a front and an elevation side view of
   the portion of the reel strip of Figure 2.      The strip
15 portion has an element 56 positioned intermediate the
   strip surface 42 and the symbol bearing surface 44.                   The
   element 56 defines the position of the symbol bearing
   surface relative to the reel surface. In this embodiment,
   the symbol is formed on one face 44 of the element 56
20 having an opposing face which is then fastened to the reel
   surface 42.
        The embodiment of Figure 4 has a symbol bearing
   surface that is orientated by the element 56 to be
25 tangential to the adjacent reel strip surface.          Any
   suitable means of orientation may be employed.          The
   element may be integrally formed with one or both of the
   reel and symbol bearing surfaces.
30      Figure 5 shows a front and an elevation side view of
   a portion of another embodiment of a reel strip, in which
   similar parts are similarly numbered. In the embodiment of
   Figure 5, the element 58 is formed separately to one
   and/or both of the reel strip and symbol bearing surfaces
35 and then subsequently fastened by an adhesive or any other
   suitable fastening means. The element 58 may be formed of,
   for example, a molded polymer, foam tape, embossed paper,
                                             9889016_1 (GHMatters) P84462.AU.3 18/01/18

   Figure 7, the element 56, the strip surface 42 and the
   symbol bearing surface are integrally formed and
15 contiguous.
         Figure 8 shows a front and an elevation side view of
   a portion of another embodiment of a reel strip, in which
   similar parts are similarly numbered. In the embodiment of
20 Figure 8, the symbol bearing surface 44 is spaced inwardly
   from the reel surface 42 to give a sunken impression.                      In
   this particular embodiment, the symbol is inverted.
         Figure 9 shows a front and an elevation side view of
25 a portion of another embodiment of a reel strip, in which
   similar parts are similarly numbered.   In the embodiment
   of Figure 9, the reel surface 42 has at least one aperture
   66 therein and the reel comprises a symbol carrier 68
   mounted within each aperture. The symbol carrier 68
30 comprising the symbol bearing surface and is mounted such
   that the symbol bearing surface is offset relative to the
   reel surface.
         The additional mass on the perimeter of the reel
35 should not cause any problems with the reel spin, but if
   necessary it could be counter-balanced by another such
   symbol on the opposite side of the reel.
