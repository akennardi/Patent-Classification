Abstract
A building construction method uses wall frames having a moveable top track.
The track is fixed in a raised position so as to be load-bearing during
construction, allowing construction work to progress quickly. When supporting
concrete columns have cured, the fixing can be released allowing the track to
move into a lowered position and for the building load to transfer to the
columns.

                    "BUILDING CONSTRUCTION METHOD"
Field of the Invention
[0001] The present invention relates to the construction of buildings. It has
been devised as a method for construction of multi-storey buildings, with
particular application to buildings with more than two storeys.
Background to the Invention
[0002] Australian building regulations require that, in general, a building of
more than three storeys must have its load bearing walls made of concrete or
masonry. These regulations are due to fire resistance requirements. It is
possible to construct a building with loads carried by steel or timber frames
which is structurally sound, however such frames can be significantly
weakened by fire.
[0003] Buildings constructed using masonry are generally built gradually
from the ground up, in courses. Beyond a certain level, it is necessary for grout
in the masonry to cure before further loads are applied. In practice, this means
that each storey must be allowed to cure before construction of a higher storey
begins.
[0004] Buildings constructed using precast concrete can be built more
quickly. Nonetheless, they can still require the individual panels to be
connected to each other, typically by grouting. In addition to the inherent
expense and difficulty in using precast panels (notably transport and
movement costs associated with the panels) the use of such panels still has
considerable 'wait' time associated with it.
[0005] In recent years, it has become more common to construct buildings
using a system of 'permanent formwork', whereby the building walls are laid
out using lightweight, hollow wall panels, and concrete is then poured into the
panels and allowed to cure to provide structural strength. While the costs of
transporting and moving such panels is considerably less than using precast

                                            3
concrete, the system requires complete curing of the concrete within the
panels of each level before a floor can be placed upon it.
[0006] All of the above systems have the further limitation that, in general, it
is necessary to wait until the load bearing walls have been secured and, where
necessary, cured before fixing internal walls within the structure. Indeed, often
it is necessary to complete the entire load-bearing structure of a building
before non load-bearing walls can be located.
[0007] The present invention proposes an alternative construction system
which seeks to alleviate some of these limitations, at least in part.
Summary of the Invention
[0008]    According to one aspect of the present invention there is provided a
method of constructing a building, the method including the steps of:
       forming a building frame, the frame being sufficiently strong to bear the
load of at least one higher storey, the frame including a plurality of vertical
channels;
       filling the channels with a curable substance;
       allowing the curable substance to cure and to form columns within the
building; and
       transferring the load from the at least one higher storey from the
building frame to the cured columns.
[0009]    Advantageously, this allows for building to continue while the
columns cure, with the load of higher stories being borne by the building
frame. On completion of the building, the cured columns become the load
bearing members preferentially to the frame, thus meeting the requirements
of the Australian building code.
[0010]     It is preferred that the building frame is formed from structural steel.
In a preferred embodiment the building frame is formed of cold-rolled section
steel with a nominal thickness in the order of 0.9mm to 1.6mm.

                                          4
[0011]    It is preferred that the curable substance is concrete.
[0012]    Preferably, the method includes the step of locating deck formwork
atop the building frame, with the channels fluidly connected to the deck
formwork. The step of filling the channels with the curable substance can
then occur at the same time as the curable substance is poured into
formwork to complete a floor surface above the building frame.
[0013]    It is preferred that internal wall frames are located at the same time
that external wall frames are located. This allows for the walls of an entire
level to be completed at the same time, and permits access for internal fitout
of lower floors while higher floors are being constructed.
[0014]   The building frame preferably includes vertical studs and horizontal
tracks. The building preferably includes a load transfer means created by
securing a top-most track to the studs using at least one removable fixing
member. The step of transferring vertical load from the frame to the cured
columns may be achieved by removal of the fixing member(s).
[0015]   Alternatively, the building frame may include a shear head arranged
to shear at a load greater than that of a single higher storey but less than the
entire structure at its completed load. In this embodiment vertical load may
be transferred by allowing the shear head to shear following curing of the
columns, allowing vertical loads to be taken by the columns rather than by
the frame.
[0016] According to a second aspect of the present invention there is
provided a wall frame component including vertical studs and horizontal
tracks, the wall frame having a top-most track moveable between a relatively
raised position and a relatively lowered position, the wall frame including
removable fixing members which maintain the top-most track in its raised
position, whereby removal of the fixing members allows the top-most track to
move into its lowered position.

Brief Description of the Drawings
[0017] It will be convenient to further describe the invention with reference to
preferred embodiments of the present invention. Other embodiments are
possible, and consequently the particularity of the following discussion is not
to be understood as superseding the generality of the preceding description
of the invention. In the drawings:
[0018] Figures 1 to 6 are sequential schematic views of a portion of a multi
storey building being constructed in accordance with the present invention;
[0019] Figure 7 is a front view of a wall frame component in accordance with
the present invention;
[0020] Figure 8 is a perspective of an upper end of the wall frame component
of Figure 7; and
[0021] Figure 9 is an end view of an upper end of the wall frame component
of Figure 7.
Detailed Description of Preferred Embodiments
[0022] Referring to the Figures, Figure 1 shows a schematic view of one level
of a multi-storey building. The level includes a base slab 10, upon which wall
frames 12 are arranged. The wall frames 12 in this embodiment have been
arranged to form the layout of internal and external walls above the slab 10.
[0023] The wall frames 12 are formed from cold-rolled steel section. Typical
wall thicknesses are in the order of 90mm. The steel is typically 0.9mm or
1.6mm nominal thickness. The wall frames 12 are constructed so as to be
able to bear relatively high vertical loads.
[0024] The wall frames 12 are arranged such that vertical channels 14 can
be located at desired intersections. The channels 14 are created by the use
of column shutters 16 located at the desired locations, as shown in Figure 2.
The vertical channels 14 are generally rectangular in cross section, and are

                                       6
sized such that when filled with concrete to form columns the concrete
columns have a greater vertical load capacity than the wall frames 12.
[0025] Once the wall frames 12 and the column shutters 16 are in position, a
framework deck 20 can be fixed atop the wall frames 12, with appropriate
reinforcing in place. The framework deck 20 is arranged such that voids in the
deck 20 locate over the openings to the vertical channels 14. Reinforcing rods
22 are positioned within the vertical channels 14, extending above the deck
20. This can be seen in Figure 3.
[0026] Concrete can then be poured to simultaneously form columns 24
within the vertical channels 14 and a suspended slab 26. The wall frames 12
are sufficiently strong to take the weight of the suspended slab 26. This is
shown in Figures 4 and 5.
[0027] As soon as the suspended slab 26 is dry, wall frames 12 can be
located atop the suspended slab 26 to form the next floor of the building. While
this is occurring, work on building services such as plumbing and electricity
can commence on the wall frames 10 of the lowest floor. The concrete of the
slab 26 and the columns 24 will cure to their final strength over time, but during
this time the load will be taken by the wall frames 12. This can be seen in
Figure 6.
[0028] The above process can be repeated for further floors.
[0029] The wall frames 12 are formed from vertical studs 30 and three
horizontal tracks: a base track 32, and intermediate track 34 and a top track
36. This can be seen in Figures 7 to 9.
[0030] The vertical studs 30 each have a lower end 40 and an upper end 42.
The vertical studs are slightly crimped at the lower end 40 so as to locate
within the base track 32, with the base track 32 and the vertical studs 30 being
of about the same width. The lower end 40 of vertical studs 30 and the base
track 32 each include screw receiving apertures 44 which are inwardly

                                           7
indented. In this way the base track 32 can be fixed to the vertical studs 30 by
means of screws 46, which are effectively countersunk so as to provide a
reasonably planar surface of the wall frame 12.
[0031] The intermediate track 34 has outer ends which are crimped so as to
locate within the vertical studs 30. The arrangement is such that the outside
of the intermediate track 34 is generally co-planar with the outside of the
vertical studs 30.
[0032] A central region of each vertical stud 30 includes screw receiving
apertures 44 which are inwardly indented, as do outer ends of the
intermediate track 34. In the same way as the base track, the intermediate
track 34 can be fixed to the vertical studs 30 by means of screws 46, which
are effectively countersunk so as to provide a reasonably planar surface of
the wall frame 12.
[0033] The top track 36 and its connection to the upper end 42 of the vertical
studs 30 is largely a mirror image to that of the base track 32. The vertical
studs are slightly crimped at the upper end 42 so as to locate within the top
track 36, with the top track 36 and the vertical studs 30 being of about the
same width. The upper end 42 of the vertical studs 30, and the top track 36,
each include screw receiving apertures 44 which are inwardly indented. In this
way the base track 32 could be fixed to the vertical studs 30 by means of
effectively countersunk screws.
[0034] The arrangement of the top track 36 differs from that of the base track
32 by the inclusion of holding screws 50.
[0035] The arrangement where the screw receiving apertures 44 of the upper
end 42 of the vertical studs 30 are aligned with those of the top track 36
represents a relatively lowered position of the top track 36. In use, the top
track 36 is held in a relatively raised position, with the top track 36 being fixed
to the vertical studs in this relatively raised position by the holding screws 50.

                                         8
[0036] In practice, the wall frames 12 as described above are built having a
top track 36 held in its raised position by the holding screws 50. This means
that the weight of the suspended slab 26 passes through from the top track
36 to the vertical studs 30 through the holding screws 50. The suspended slab
26 is supported by the wall frames 12 in this fashion.
[0037] Once the columns 24 have cured, the holding screws 50 can be
removed. Removal of the holding screws 50 allows movement of the top track
36 between its relatively raised and lowered positions, relative to the slab 26.
With the removal of the holding screws 50 the vertical load of the slab 26 (and
higher storeys) is taken by the columns 24, with the wall frames 12 no longer
being load bearing.
[0038] This means that, in effect, the wall frames 12 are load bearing during
construction of the building, allowing for an extremely fast-paced construction.
Following construction, they cease to be load bearing, with the load bearing
elements being concrete as required by the building codes.
[0039] In an alternative embodiment, the holding screws 50 may be designed
to shear under a particular loading, for instance the loading of two higher
stories. The shearing of the holding screws 50 will serve the same purpose of
transferring load from the wall frames 12.
[0040] Modifications and variations as would be apparent to a skilled
addressee are deemed to be within the scope of the present invention.
