           The present invention relates generally to a new crystalline form of cyclosporine A
   and particularly pharmaceutical use of the newly identified form of cyclosporine A. The
   invention further relates to methods for its preparation and to methods for treating certain

                               BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
           The exposed part of a normal eye is covered by a thin tear film. The presence of a
   continuous tear film is important for the well-being of the corneal and conjunctival
   epithelium and provides the cornea with an optically high quality surface. In addition, the
20 aqueous part of the tear film acts as a lubricant to the eyelids during blinking of the lids.
   Furthermore, certain enzymes contained in the tear fluid, for example immunoglobin A,
   lysozyme and beta lysin, are known to have bacteriostatic properties.
   A sound lacrimal system functions to form and maintain a properly structured, continuous
25 tear film. The lacrimal apparatus consists of the secretory system (the source), the
   distribution system, and the excretory system (the sink). In the secretory system, aqueous
   tears are supplied by main and accessory lacrimal glands.
   The bulk of the tear film is made of such aqueous tear. The continuous production and
30 drainage of aqueous tear is important in maintaining the corneal and conjunctival epithelium
   in a moist state, in providing nutrients for epithelial respiration, in supplying bacteriostatic
   agents and in cleaning the ocular surface by the flushing action of tear movement.
   Surgical procedures have been suggested in the management of dry eye states. Where there
                                                    1

   has been significant conjunctival destruction, mucous membrane transplants have been
   advocated. It has also been suggested that parotid (saliva) duct transplantation can be useful
   in the management of dry eyes. However, surgical alterations to combat dry eye conditions
   constitute a dramatic remedy and any benefit resulting from these alterations is questionable.

   Other diseases of the eye include phacoanaphylactic endophthalmitis, uveitis, and
   keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS). These diseases can be located throughout the eye, in both
   the posterior and anterior chambers of the eye as well as in the vitreous body.
10 Uveitis, the inflammation of the uvea, is responsible for about 10% of the visual impairment
   in the United States. Phacoanaphylactic endophthalmitis is a human autoimmune disease.
   Panuveitis refers to inflammation of the entire uveal (vascular) layer of the eye. Posterior
   uveitis generally refers to chorioentinitis, and anterior uveitis refers to iridocyclitis. The
15 inflammatory products (i.e. cells, fibrins, excess proteins) of these inflammations are
   commonly found in the fluid spaces if the eye, i.e. anterior chamber, posterior chamber and
   vitreous space as well as infiltrating the tissue intimately involved in the inflammatory
   response. Uveitis may occur following surgical or traumatic injury to the eye; as a
   component of an autoimmune disorder, i.e. rheumatoid arthritis, Behcet's disease, ankylosing
20 spondylitis, sarcoidosis; as an isolated immune mediated ocular disorder, i.e. pars planitis,
   iridocyclitis etc., unassociated with known etiologies; and following certain systemic diseases
   which cause antibody-antigen complexes to be deposited in the uveal tissues. Together these
   disorders represent the non-infectious uveitities.
25 Phacoanaphylaxis is a severe form of uveitis in which the lens in the causative antigen. The
   lens proteins are normally secluded by the lens capsule since before birth. When these
   proteins are released into the eye by injury or by surgery or occasionally during cataract
   development, they can become intensely antigenic and incite an autoimmune response. If the
   response is moderate it is seen as chronic uveitis. If it is very fast in progression the eye
30 becomes seriously inflamed in all segments. This latter response is named phacoanaphylaxis.
   Cyclosporines are a group of nonpolar cyclic oligopeptides with known immunosuppressant
   activity. Cyclosporin A, along with several other minor metabolites, as well as cyclosporin
   B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, 0, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y and Z, have been

   identified. The use of cyclosporine A and cyclosporine A derivatives to treat the ophthalmic
   conditions set forth above has been the subject of various patents, for example Ding et al U.S.

   disclosure of each of which is incorporated in its entirely herein by reference. With respect to
 5 its solid state chemistry, cyclosporine A (CsA) is known to exist in an amorphous form,
   liquid crystal form, tetragonal crystalline form (Form 1), and an orthorhombic form (Form 3).

 5 to the orthorhombic or tetragonal forms; as well as, peaks having an intensity greater than 5
   times the background.
           In one embodiment, the new crystalline form (Form 2) of CsA is a nonstoichiometric
   hydrate of Cyclosporin A.
           In another embodiment, the crystalline Form 2 is represented by the formula:

   wherein X is the number of molecules of water and varies from 0-3. In one embodiment, X
   in the above formula is 2.
           Form 2 appears to be a kinetically stable form of CsA in aqueous suspensions.
   Suspensions containing Form 2 show no conversion to other known polymorphic or
25 pseudomorphic forms upon storage. It has been found that Form 1 and the amorphous form
   convert to Form 2 in the presence of water.
   The single crystal structure of the newly discovered hydrate form of cyclosporine A (Form
   2) was determined and the crystal structure parameters are listed in Table 2. These results
   indicate that Form 2 is a unique compared to other known crystalline forms of cyclosporine
30 A.

           The asymmetric unit of this CsA Form 2 was found to contain one cyclosporine A
   molecule and two water molecules. It is possible that any small molecule that can hydrogen
   bond to water could play the role of space filler, which would give a range of potential
   structures running from the orthorhombic dihydrate to distorted monoclinic dihydrate.
10 The XRPD pattern calculated from the single-crystal structure is shown in Figure 7 and it
   matches the experimental pattern shown in Figure 2. These matching patterns further
   corroborate that Form 2 is a unique and pure crystalline form of cyclosporine A.
                                                                6

           Without wishing to be bound by theory, thermogravimetric analysis combined with
   KF titration and vapor sorption desorption analysis (VSA) suggest that CsA Form 2 is a non
   stoichiometric hydrate of CsA. The vapor sorption analysis of Cyclosporine Form 2 indicates
 5 that water content in the new crystal form reversibly varies with relative humidity as shown
   in Fig. 3. Similar to the tetragonal form, the new CsA form undergoes a phase transition to a
   liquid crystal or amorphous form at 124.4"C prior to melting as indicated by the modulated
   differential calorimetric (MDSC) analysis (Figure 4).
10         The new physical form of CsA has a higher solubility (130 pg/mL) than orthorhombic
   form (100 pg/mL)in ophthalmic formulation vehicles containing 1 % PS80. This is desirable
   for developing solution or suspension formulations. The new form appears to be a more
   stable form than the tetragonal in aqueous solution. Form 2 offers some advantages over the
   tetragonal and orthorhombic forms in alternative formulations
15 such as ocular implants, tablets, capsules and semi-solid formulations, liquid get capsules,
   suspensions and micro-emulsions.
           In addition, it has been discovered that Form 2 is more readily millable than Forms 1
   or 3.  Milling is very important since, in a Cyclosporin A sustained release suspension, large
20 particles (i.e., > 40 pm) have been observed to settle in a 2% hyaluronic acid (hydrogel)
   formulation and to be difficult to re-suspend. The CsA Form 2 is readily milled to 10 pm or
   smaller. Physically stable suspensions of these crystals have been prepared at concentrations
   of up to 10% in 2.5o% hyaluronic acid.
25         In addition to physical stability, it is anticipated that smaller particle size will deliver
   more drug to the tissue, by virtue of the increased surface area. Reducing particle size for
   this reason may be critical because Form 2 appears to have lower dissolution characteristics
   than the amorphous form and therefore will likely have lower delivery to the tissue, although
   the smaller particle size may mitigate this problem. Indeed, it has been discovered that
30 making nanoparticles is easier with Form 2 than Forms 1 or 3. So, if it is required to
   nanosize the crystals in order to improve drug delivery to the tissue and/or to improve the
   physical stability of the suspension, Form 2 provides a distinct advantage over other forms.

           Pharmaceutical compositions may be prepared by combining a therapeutically
   effective amount of CsA Form 2 according to the invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable
   salt thereof, as an active ingredient, with conventional ophthalmically acceptable
   pharmaceutical excipients, and by preparation of unit dosage forms suitable for topical ocular
 5 use. The therapeutically efficient amount typically is between about 0.000 1 and about 50%
   (w/v), preferably about 0.001 to about 1.0% (w/v) in liquid formulations.
           For ophthalmic application, preferably solutions are prepared using a physiological
   saline solution as a major vehicle. The pH of such ophthalmic solutions should preferably be
   maintained between 4.5 and 8.0 with an appropriate buffer system, a neutral pH being
10 preferred but not essential. The formulations may also contain conventional,
   pharmaceutically acceptable preservatives, stabilizers and surfactants.
           Preferred preservatives that may be used in the pharmaceutical compositions of the
   present invention include, but are not limited to, benzalkonium chloride, chlorobutanol,
   thimerosal, phenylmercuric acetate and phenylmercuric nitrate. A preferred surfactant is, for
15 example, Tween 80. Likewise, various preferred vehicles may be used in the ophthalmic
   preparations of the present invention. These vehicles include, but are not limited to,
   polyvinyl alcohol, povidone, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, poloxamers, carboxymethyl

            The pharmaceutical compositions containing CsA Form 2 are useful in treating a
   variety of ocular disorders. Thus, in another embodiment of the invention there are provided
15 methods for treating an aqueous deficient dry eye state, uveitis, phacoanaphylactic
   endophthalmitis, or keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS) in an eye, comprising administering to a
   subject in need thereof cyclosporine A in crystalline form 2 in an ophthalmically acceptable
   carrier.
20          One aspect of the present invention relates to pharmaceutical compositions for
   alleviating dry eye related symptoms, for example, as in patients having immune mediated
   keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS) or dry eye disease or other autoimmune dysfunction of the
   lacrimal gland, as well as dry eye symptoms of contact lens wearers.
25          Dry eye generally refers to any tear film abnormality, usually with epithelial
   abnormalities. A specific deficiency of the aqueous component of the tear film is known as
   keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS), which affects about 30 million people worldwide. It is
   usually included as part of Sjogren's syndrome. Literally the term denotes inflammation of
   the comea and conjunctiva secondary to drying.
30
            When the tear film fails to perform its functions of lubrication, oxygenation, and
   removal of debris, symptoms of foreign body sensation (grittiness, scratchiness, sandiness),
   fatigue, and dryness result. A patient may experience severe pain, especially in the presence
                                                    9

       WO 2012/166610                                                          PCT/US2012/039611
   of filamentary keratopathy. Loss of the smooth refractive surface of the tear film causes
   blurred vision, which can vary from blink to blink, accounting for a variable manifest
   refraction and for complaints of variable vision throughout the day. Surface drying may
   produce reflex tearing and the misleading complaint of excess tears. Typically, symptoms of
 5 tear deficiency are worse late in the day, with prolonged use of the eyes (as when the patient
   reads or watches television), and in conditions of heat, wind, and low humidity (as on the
   beach or ski slopes). Symptoms that are worse in the morning suggest an associated chronic
   blepharitis, recurrent corneal epithelial erosion, or exposure keratopathy. Further, symptoms
   include superficial punctate erosions, corneal filaments, coarse mucus plaques, and epithelial
10 defects.
           As hereinabove noted, most of these symptoms result from the unstable tear film and
   abnormal ocular surface that diminish the ability of the ocular surface to respond to
   environmental challenges. Dry eye syndrome, if left untreated, can cause progressive
15 pathological changes in the conjunctival and corneal epithelium.
           The etiologies of dry eye are varied. The disease generally referred to as "dry eye"
   may be the result of age-related decreases in systemic androgen support to the lacrimal gland
   or systemic autoimmune diseases such as Sjogrens Syndrome. A growing body of research
20 suggests that dry eye is the result of an underlying cytokine and receptor-mediated
   inflammatory process.
           Palliative agents, such as tear replacement, tear preservation, and autonomic tear
   stimulation, may provide complete or partial relief of symptoms. However, therapeutic
25 treatments directed at the underlying inflammatory process may prove beneficial in
   correcting the underlying disorder.
           The tear film in a normal eye consists of a thin (about 6-45 um in thickness) film
   composed of a mucous layer lying over the corneal epithelium and an aqueous layer covering
30 the mucous layer and epithelium, which is in turn covered by an extremely thin (0.01-0.22
   um) layer of lipid molecules.
           The presence of a continuous tear film is important for the well-being of the corneal
   and conjunctival epithelium and provides the cornea with an optically high quality surface.
                                                    10

       WO 2012/166610                                                             PCT/US2012/039611
   In addition, the aqueous part of the tear film acts as a lubricant to the eyelids during blinking
   of the lids. Furthermore, certain enzymes contained in the tear fluid, for example,
   immunoglobulin A, lysozyme and beta lysin, are known to have bacteriostatic properties.
 5           It is believed that the lipid layer is responsible for retarding evaporation of water
   from the eye. If the lipid layer of the tear film is disturbed by, for example, trauma, disease,
   irritation of the eye or contact lens wear, excessive evaporation of water from the eye may
   occur, leaving the surface of the eye "dry" (see e.g., Cedarstaff and Tomlinson, Am. J.
   Optometry & Physiol. Optics, 60:167-174, 1983 [tear film disruption in patients with
10 keratoconjunctivitis sicca, or "dry eye"]).
            A normal lacrimal system functions to form and maintain a properly structured,
   continuous tear film. The lacrimal system consists of the secretory system (the source), the
   distribution system and the excretory system (the sink). In the secretory system, aqueous
15 tears are supplied by the main and accessory lacrimal glands.
            Excessive evaporation of water from the tear film results in ocular discomfort
   (frequently experienced by the person as dryness or tired eyes or other less frequently
   reported discomfort symptoms) and may eventually lead to physiological and pathological
20 changes in the tissue of the eye, especially in the cornea. For contact lens wearers, such
   discomfort is particularly acute because the loss of water from the tear film occurs at the
   interface between the tear film and the lens. Further, if the lens is a hydrogel "soft" lens,
   excessive evaporation of water from the tear film can also result in excessive evaporation of
   water from the lens.
25
            Thus taking into account this evaporation, the continuous production and drainage of
   aqueous tear is important to maintaining the corneal and conjunctival epithelium in a moist
   state, in providing nutrients for epithelian respiration, in supplying bacteriostatic agents and
   in cleaning the ocular surface by the flushing action of tear movement.
30
            In relatively mild cases, the main symptom of KCS is a foreign body sensation or a
   mild "scratchiness". This can progress to become a constant, intense burning irritative
   sensation which can be debilitating to the patient. More severe forms of KCS progress to the
   development of filamentary keratitis, a painful condition characterized by the appearance of
                                                       11

       WO 2012/166610                                                           PCT/US2012/039611
   numerous strands or filaments attached to the comeal surface. Recent evidence suggests that
   these filaments represent breaks in the continuity of the normal corneal epithelial cells. The
   shear created by lid motion pulls these filaments, causing pain. Management of this stage of
   KCS is very difficult.
 5
            A frequent complication of KCS is secondary infection. Several breakdowns in the
   eye's normal defense mechanism seem to occur, presumably attributable to a decrease in the
   concentration of antibacterial lysozyme in the aqueous tears of a patient suffering from KCS.
10          Normally, aqueous-deficient dry eye states, such as, for example, KCS, are treated by
   supplementation of the tears with artificial tear substitutes. However, relief is limited by the
   retention time of the administered artificial tear solution in the eye. Typically, the effect of an
   artificial tear solution administered to the eye dissipates within about thirty to forty-five
   minutes. The effect of such products, while soothing initially, does not last long enough. The
15 patient is inconvenienced by the necessity of repeated administration of the artificial tear
   solution in the eye as needed to supplement the normal tears.
