         BENZYLIDENEGUANIDINE DERIVATIVES AND THERAPEUTIC USE FOR THE
                                   TREATMENT OF PROTEIN MISFOLDING DISEASES
This application is a divisional application of Australian Application No. 2014204831 the
specification and drawings of which as originally filed are incorporated herein in their
entirety by reference.
The present invention relates to compounds that have potential therapeutic applications in
treating disorders associated with protein misfolding stress and in particular with an
accumulation of misfolded proteins. In particular, the invention provides compounds that
are capable of exhibiting a protective effect against cytotoxic endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
stress.
BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION
The compound 2-(2,6-dichlorobenzylidene)hydrazinecarboximidamide, also referred to as
guanabenz, is an alpha agonist of the alpha-2 type that is used as an antihypertensive
drug.

                                                               ZNN     NH2
                                                                     NH2
                                                             CI
                                                            Guanabenz
Various derivatives of guanabenz have also been reported. For example, US 3,982,020
(Sandoz, Inc.) discloses substituted benzylidene hydrazines and their use as
hypoglycemic-antihyperglycemic agents, anti-obesity agents and anti-inflammatory
agents. US 2004/0068017 (Bausch & Lomb Inc.) discloses substituted benzylidene
hydrazines that are capable of increasing the activity of gelatinase A in ocular cells. The
molecules have applications in the treatment of primary open angle glaucoma. WO
2008/061647 (Acure Pharma AB) discloses the use of N-(2-chloro-3,4,
dimethoxybenzylideneamino)guanidine as a VEGFR inhibitor and its associated
applications in the treatment or prevention of undesired blood vessel formation during
tumour growth and/or inflammatory conditions. WO 2005/031000 (Acadia
Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) discloses substituted benzylidene hydrazines and their use in
treating acute pain and chronic neuropathic pain. Finally, EP 1908464 (CNRS) discloses
                                                                1

guanabenz and chloroguanabenz and their use in the treatment of polyglutamine
expansion associated diseases, including Huntington's disease.
More recently it has been reported that guanabenz has therapeutic potential in a number
of other areas. Guanabenz, was recently noted to have anti-prion activity (D. Tribouillard
Tanvier et al., 2008 PLoS One 3, el 981). It has been reported that its activity in
protecting against protein misfolding is surprisingly much broader and includes attenuating
accumulation of mutant Huntingtin in cell-based assays (WO 2008/041133) and protection
against the lethal effects of expression of misfolding prone Insulin Akita mutant in the
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of Min6 and INS-1 pancreatic beta-cells (P. Tsaytler, H. P.
Harding,D. Ron and A. Bertolotti, Science, 332, 1 April 2011, 91-94).
Guanabenz has also been shown to promote survival of HeLa cells exposed to otherwise
cytotoxic ER-stress induced by the N-glycosylation inhibitor tunicamycin, in a dose
dependent manner (P. Tsaytler, H. P. Harding,D. Ron and A. Bertolotti, Science, 332, 1
April 2011, 91-94). Quantitative assessment of cell viability revealed that guanabenz
doubled the number of cells surviving ER stress with a median effective concentration of ~
0.4 pM. Neither the a2-adrenergic receptor agonist clonidine, nor the a2-adrenergic
receptor antagonist efaroxan protected cells from cytotoxic ER stress and efaroxan did not
interfere with guanabenz's protective effect (P. Tsaytler, H. P. Harding, D. Ron and A.
Bertolotti, Science, 332, 1 April 2011, 91-94). These observations demonstrate that
guanabenz rescues cells from lethal ER stress by a mechanism independent of the a2
adrenergic receptor. Guanabenz protects cells from otherwise lethal accumulation of
misfolded proteins by binding to a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 1,
PPP1 R1 5A (GADD34), selectively disrupting the stress-induced dephosphorylation of the
a subunit of translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2a). Guanabenz sets the translation rates in
stressed cells to a level manageable by available chaperones, thereby restoring protein
homeostasis. It was reported that Guanabenz does not bind to the constitutive PPP1 R1 5B
(CReP) and therefore does not inhibit translation in non-stressed cells. (P. Tsaytler, H. P.
Harding, D. Ron and A. Bertolotti, Science, 332, 1 April 2011, 91-94).
Failure to maintain proteostasis in the ER by mounting an adequate unfolded protein
response (UPR) is recognized as a contributing factor to many pathological conditions.
Thus, the molecules described here, which inhibit eIF2a phosphatase to fine-tune protein
                                                            2

synthesis, may be of therapeutic benefit to a large number of diseases caused protein
misfolding stress and in particular with an accumulation of misfolded proteins.
CA958018 and WO 93/03714 disclose benzylideneguanidine derivatives.
The present invention seeks to provide alternative compounds based on a guanabenz
core structure that have potential therapeutic applications in treating disorders associated
with protein misfolding stress and in particular with an accumulation of misfolded proteins.

with an accumulation of misfolded proteins, and in particular with accumulation of
misfolded proteins, chosen from Charcot Marie Tooth neuropathy; severe Dejerine-Sottas
                                                                    3

syndrome; retinal diseases, preferably Retinitis pigmentosa, retinal ciliopathies, macular
degeneration or diabetic retinopathy, and ALS.
Previous studies have indicated that the aryl group must be at least disubstituted in order
for the compounds to exhibit useful pharmacological activity (see for example, D.
Tribouillard-Tanvier et al., PLoS One 3, e1981 (2008) and EP1908464A, CNRS).
However, contrary to the results of previous studies, the present Applicant has surprisingly
found that mono-substituted aryl derivatives are also active.
Moreover, compounds of formula (1) as defined above advantageously exhibit no activity
toward the adrenergic a2A receptor relative to prior art compounds such as Guanabenz
(Figure 4). This loss in alpha-2 adrenergic activity renders the compounds therapeutically
useful in the treatment of the disorders associated with protein misfolding stress and in
particular with an accumulation of misfolded proteins, such as Charcot Marie Tooth
(CMT), retinal diseases, preferably Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP), Alzheimer's disease,
Parkinson's disease (PD), Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), Huntington's disease,
tauopathies, prion diseases, diabetes, preferably type 2 diabetes and cancer. The
absence of alpha-2 adrenergic activity means that compounds of formula (1)can be
administered at a dosage suitable to treat the aforementioned diseases, without any
significant effect on blood pressure.
A second aspect of the invention relates to a compound of formula (II), or a
pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof,

The unfolded protein response (UPR) is a component of the cellular defence system
against misfolded proteins that adapts folding in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to
changing conditions. The UPR is activated in response to an accumulation of unfolded or
misfolded proteins in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. In this scenario, the UPR
has two primary aims: (i) to restore normal function of the cell by halting protein
translation, and (ii) to activate the signaling pathways that lead to the increased production
of molecular chaperones involved in protein folding. If these objectives are not achieved
within a certain time frame, or the disruption is prolonged, the UPR aims towards
apoptosis.
Upstream components of the UPR are the ER-resident trans-membrane proteins IRE1,
ATF6, and PERK, which sense folding defects to reprogram transcription and translation
in a concerted manner and restore proteostasis. Activated IRE1 and ATF6 increase the
transcription of genes involved in ER folding, such as those encoding the chaperones BiP
and GRP94. Activated PERK attenuates global protein synthesis by phosphorylating the
subunit of translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2a) on Ser5l while promoting translation of the
transcription factor ATF4. The latter controls expression of CHOP, another transcription
factor, which in turn promotes expression of PPP1R15A/GADD34. PPP1R15A, an
effector of a negative feedback loop that terminates UPR signaling, recruits a catalytic
subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1c) to dephosphorylate eIF2a, allowing protein
synthesis to resume. UPR failure contributes to many pathological conditions that might
be corrected by adequate boost of this adaptive response. Selective inhibitors of the
stressed-induced eIF2a phosphatase PPP1R15A-PP1 delays eIF2a dephosphorylation
and consequently protein synthesis selectively in stressed cells, without affecting protein
synthesis in unstressed cells. This prolongs the beneficial effects of the UPR. A transient
reduction of protein synthesis is beneficial to stressed cells because decreasing the flux of
proteins synthetized increases the availability of chaperones and thus protects from
misfolding stress (P. Tsaytler, H. P. Harding, D. Ron and A. Bertolotti, Science, 332, 1
April 2011, 91-94). Non-selective inhibitors of the 2 eIF2a phosphatases might have
undesirable effects, as persistent translation inhibition is deleterious. Indeed, genetic
ablation of both PPP1 R15A and PPP1 R15B results in early embryonic lethality in mice
indicating that inhibition of the two eIF2a phosphatases PPP1R15A-PP1 and PPP1R15B
PP1 is deleterious in an organismal context. In contrast, genetic ablation of PPP1 R15A
has no harmful consequence in mice (Harding et al., 2009, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 106,
                                                             12

1832-1837). Furthermore, specific inhibitors of PPP1 R1 5A are predicted to be inert in
unstressed cells, as the PPP1 R15A is not expressed in absence of stress. Thus, selective
PPP1 R1 5A inhibitors are predicted to be safe. Non-selective inhibitors of the two eIF2a
phosphatases may also be useful to treat protein misfolding diseases, when used at
doses that result in only a partial inhibition of the phosphatases.
Cytoprotection against ER stress can be measured by a suitable assay. For example,
cytoprotection can be measured in HeLa cells in which ER stress is elicited by the addition
of media containing tunicamycin, a mixture of homologous nucleoside antibiotics that
inhibits the UDP-HexNAc: polyprenol-P HexNAc-1-P family of enzymes and is used to
induce unfolded protein response. Cell viability can be detected in the presence and
absence of inhibitor compounds after a set period of time, by measuring the reduction of
WST-8 into formazan using a standard cell viability kit (such as Cell Viability Counting Kit
8 from Dojindo). Cytoprotection from ER stress is measured in terms of the percentage
increase in viable cells (relative to control) after ER stress. Further details of a suitable
assay are set forth in the accompanying Examples section.
In one preferred embodiment, the compound of formula (1)is capable of prolonging the
protective effect of the UPR relative to the control (i.e. in the absence of inhibitor
compound) by at least 20 %, more preferably, at least 30 %, even more preferably, at
least 40 %, at least 50 %, at least 60%, at least 70 %, at least 80 %, more preferably still,
at least 90 %.
The Applicant has demonstrated that compounds of formula (1)are inhibitors of
PPP1R15A-PP1 interaction which induce a protective effect. Preferably, the compound
exhibits a protective effect with EC5 0 of less than about 5pM, even more preferably, less
than about 2pM, more preferably still, less than about 1pM. The compound should
preferably be devoid of alpha2 adrenergic activity. Thus, in one preferred embodiment the
compound does not exhibit any activity in a functional alpha-2-adrenergic assay.
The Applicant has further demonstrated that certain compounds of formula (1)selectively
inhibit PPP1R15A-PP1, and thus prolong the protective effect of the UPR, thereby
rescuing cells from protein misfolding stress. Inhibitors of PPP1 R1 5A-PP1 described in
the present invention therefore have therapeutic applications in the treatment of a variety
of diseases associated with protein misfolding stress and in particular with an
accumulation of misfolded proteins.

Charcot Marie Tooth
In one preferred embodiment, the compound of formula (1)is for use in treating Charcot
Marie Tooth.
Over a 100 mutations in the gene encoding myelin protein zero (PO), a single-pass
transmembrane protein, which is the major protein produced by myelinating Schwann
cells causes Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy (D'Antonio et al., 2009, J Neurosci Res, 87,
3241-9). The mutations are dominantly inherited and cause the disease through a gain of
toxic function (D'Antonio et al., 2009, J Neurosci Res, 87, 3241-9). Deletion of serine 63
from PO (POS63del) causes Charcot-Marie-Tooth 1B neuropathy in humans and a similar
demyelinating neuropathy in transgenic mice. The mutant protein accumulates in the ER
and induces the UPR (D'Antonio et al., 2009, J Neurosci Res, 87, 3241-9). Genetic
ablation of CHOP, a pro-apoptotic gene in the UPR restores motor function in Charcot
                                                             16

Marie-Tooth mice (Pennuto et al., 2008, Neuron, 57, 393-405). The finding that
PPP1R15A inhibition in cells nearly abolishes CHOP expression in ER-stressed cells
indicates that genetic or pharmacological inhibition of PPP1 R15A should reduce motor
dysfunction in Charcot-Marie-Tooth mice. Recently, D'Antonio et al. (2013 J.Exp. Med Vol.
ppl -18) demonstrated that POS63del mice treated with salubrinal, a small molecule that
increases the phosphorylation of elF2alpha (Boyce et al. 2005 Science Vol. 307 pp935
939) regained almost normal motor capacity in rotarod analysis and was accompanied by
a rescue of morphological and electro-physiological abnormalities. Accumulation of the of
CMT-related mutant in the ER proteins is not unique to POS63del; at least five other PO
mutants have been identified that are retained in the ER and elicit an UPR (Pennuto et al.,
2008 Neuron Vol.57 pp393-405; Saporta et al., 2012 Brain Vol.135 pp2032-204 7 ). In
addition, protein misfolding and accumulation of misfolded protein in the ER have been
implicated in the pathogenesis of other CMT neuropathies as a result of mutations in
PMP22 and Cx32 (Colby et al., 2000 Neurobiol.Disease Vol. 7 pp561-573; Kleopa et al.,
2002 J. Neurosci. Res. Vol.68 pp522-534; Yum et al., 2002 Neurobiol. Dis. Vol. 11 pp43
52). However, Salubrinal is toxic and can not be used to treat human patients D'Antonio et
al. (2013 J.Exp. Med Vol. ppl-18). In contrast, the PPP1R15A inhibitors of formula (1)are
predicted to be safe and could be useful for the treatment of CMT-1A and 1B.
Retinal diseases
Recently published literature has provided evidences that the UPR is involved in the
development of retinal degeneration: inherited retinal degeneration such as retinal
ciliopathies & retinitis pigmentosa, macular degeneration, retinopathy of premarurity, light
induced retinal degeneration, retinal detachment, diabetic retinopathy and glaucoma (for
review Gorbatyuk et Gorbatyuk 2013 - Retinal degeneration: Focus on the unfolded
protein response, Molecular Vision Vol. 19 pp1985-1998).
In one preferred embodiment, the compound of formula (1)is for use in treating retinal
diseases, more preferably, inherited retinal degeneration such as retinal ciliopathies &
retinitis pigmentosa, macular degeneration, retinopathy of premarurity, light-induced
retinal degeneration, retinal detachment, diabetic retinopathy and glaucoma.
Retinal ciliopathies are a group of rare genetic disorders originating from a defect in the
primary cilium of photoreceptors thus inducing retinitis pigmentosa. This defect has been
reported to induce an ER stress due to protein accumulation in the inner segment of the
                                                            17

H:\rbr\teroven\NRPortbl\DCC\RBR\6110457 I.doex-4/12/2017
photoreceptor which in turn induces the UPR (W02013/124484). Retinal degeneration is
a very common feature in ciliopathies that can be observed either in isolated retinitis
pigmentosa such as Leber's congenital amaurosis or X-linked retinitis pigmentosa, or also
in syndromic conditions like the Bardet-Biedl Syndrome (BBS) or the Alstr6m syndrome
(ALMS). The retinal ciliopathy is selected from the group consisting of Bardet-Biedl
syndrome, Senior-Loken syndrome, Joubert syndrome, Salidono-Mainzer syndrome,
Sensenbrenner syndrome, Jeune syndrome, Meckel-Gruder syndrome, Alstr6m
syndrome, MORM syndrome, Leber's congenital amaurosis caused by mutation in a
ciliary gene and X-linked retinitis pigmentosa caused by mutation in the RPGR gene.
Retinitis pigmentosa is an inherited, degenerative eye disease that causes severe vision
impairment and often blindness. It is the most common cause of genetically determined
blindness. Sufferers will experience one or more of the following symptoms: night
blindness; tunnel vision (no peripheral vision); peripheral vision (no central vision);
latticework vision; aversion to glare; slow adjustment from dark to light environments and
vice versa; blurring of vision; poor color separation; and extreme tiredness.
Emerging evidence supports a role of ER stress in retinal apoptosis and cell death (Jing et
al., 2012, Exp Diabetes Res, 2012, 589589). Retinis pigmentosa (RP) is the most
common form of hereditary retinal degeneration caused by over 100 mutations in the
rhodopsin gene (Dryja et al., 1991, Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A, 88, 9370-4). Rhodopsin is a
G protein-coupled receptor that transduces light in the rod photoreceptors and consists of
a covalent complex between the transmembrane protein opsin of 348 amino acids,
covalently bound to 11-cis retinal (Palczewski, 2006, Annu Rev Biochem, 75, 743-67).
The RP-causing rhodopsin mutations are mostly missense mutations distributed
throughout the protein (Dryja et al., 1991, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 88, 9370-4), similar to
the ALS-causing SOD1 mutations (Valentine et al., 2005, Annu Rev Biochem, 74, 563
93). The RP-causing rhodopsin mutants have been studied in diverse systems and results
from heterologous expression of the proteins in mammalian cells, in transgenic mice and
drosophila are consistent (Griciuc et al., 2011, Trends Mol Med, 17, 442-51). The most
prevalent RP-causing rhodopsin are misfolded, do not bind 11-cis-retinal, do not reach the
cell surface but are retained in the ER (Griciuc et al., 2011, Trends Mol Med, 17, 442-51).
Misfolding of the rhodopsin mutants causes ER stress and rod cell death (Griciuc et al.,
2011, Trends Mol Med, 17, 442-51). This strongly suggests that the PPP1 R1 5A inhibitors
described in the invention will be useful to treat RP.

Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the main cause of legal blindness among
those over 65 years of age in the United States. AMD was reported to account for 54% of
all current cases of blindness among the Caucasian population in the United States. The
study predicted that as a result of the rising prevalence of AMD, the number of blind
people in the US could increase by as much as 70% by 2020.
Shen et al. (2011 Effect of Guanabenz on Rat AMD Models and Rabbit Choroidal Blood
Vol. 5 pp27-31) demonstrated that Guanabenz significantly protected retinal pigment
epithelium (RPE) from NalO3-induced degeneration, inhibited the development of
choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in laser-induced rat AMD model and increased
choroidal blood flow markedly in vivo.
However, Guanabenz is an alpha2 adrenergic receptor and because of its hypotensive
activity, it can not be used to treat retinal or macular degeneration.
Compounds of the invention which are PPP1 R1 5A inhibitors like Guanabenz but which
advantageously exhibit no activity toward the adrenergic alpha2A receptor will ameliorate
retinal or macular degeneration.
Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, ALS, Huntington's disease, tauopathies
and prion diseases
As disclosed, the compound of formula (1)may be for use in treating a disease selected
from Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, ALS, Huntington's disease, tauopathies
and prion diseases.
Because accumulation of misfolded proteins is a hallmark of diverse diseases and having
shown that compound of formula (1)reduces accumulation of 4 unrelated misfolded and
disease-causing proteins (FIGURE 4-6), the compound of formula (1)will be useful to also
treat other neurodegenerative diseases caused by accumulation of misfolded proteins.
In addition, as UPR induction is a hallmark of these diseases caused by accumulation of
misfolded protein, the compound of formula (1)will be useful to treat these diseases.
(Scheper & Hoozemans 2009; Kim et al. 2008).
Guanabenz reduces the symptoms of prion infected mice (D. Tribouillard-Tanvier et al.,
2008 PLoS One 3, el 981). However, Guanabenz is not useful for the treatment of human
protein misfolding diseases due to its hypotensive activity. In contrast, the PPP1R15A
                                                           19

H:\rbr\hnterwoven\NRPortbl\DCC\RBR\6110457 I.doex-4/12/2017
inhibitors, devoid of alpha2 adrenergic activity, and described in this invention could be
useful to treat prion diseases.
Parkinson's disease (PD)
Salubrinal inhibits the PPP1 R1 5A mediated dephosphorylation of elF2a (Boyce et al.
2005 Science Vol. 307 pp935-939). Recently, Colla et al. (J. of Neuroscience 2012 Vol. 32
N0 10 pp3306-3320) demonstrated that Salubrinal significantly attenuates disease
manifestations in two animal models of alpha-synucleinopathy.
Without to be bound by a theory, it is anticipated that compounds of the invention which
are PPP1 R1 5A inhibitors will ameliorate disease manifestations of alpha-syncleinopathies
such as Parkinson's disease.
Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)
Saxena et al. (Nature Neuroscience 2009 Vol. 12 pp627-636) demonstrated that
Salubrinal extends the life span of a G93A-SOD1 transgenic mouse model of motor
neuron disease. Without to be bound by a theory, it is anticipated that compounds of the
invention which are PPP1R15A inhibitors will ameliorate disease manifestations of ALS
with the SOD1 mutation G93A.                                More than 140, mostly missense, mutations in the
SOD1 gene cause aggregation of the affected protein in familial forms of amyotrophic
lateral sclerosis (ALS). Because diverse SOD1 mutants share common defects (Munch et
al. 2010), it is accepted that diverse SOD1 mutant cause ALS by a common mechanism.
Moreover, the clinical manifestations are shared between sporadic and familial forms of
the diseases, and it is now well recognized that protein misfolding plays a central role in
both familial and sporadic ALS. Therefore, the compounds of formula (1)can be used to
treat both familial and sporadic forms of ALS.
The Applicant has found that the cytoprotective activity of guanabenz on protein
misfolding stress is surprisingly broad as guanabenz also reduces mutant huntingtin
accumulation in cells (WO 2008/041133). This finding is unexpected since mutant
huntingtin is either cytosolic or nuclear. However, there is evidence that mutant huntingtin
metabolism has previously been connected to the ER stress response (Nishitoh et al.,
2002, Genes Dev, 16, 1345-55; Rousseau et al., 2004, Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A, 101,
9648-53; Duennwald and Lindquist, 2008, Genes Dev, 22, 3308-19). The Applicant's
findings that guanabenz protects cells from cytotoxic ER stress and reduces mutant
huntingtin accumulation further supports the idea that there may be aspects of the ER
                                                                     20

  \rbr\Interwoven\NRPortbl\DCC\RBR\16110457_l.docx-4 12/2017
stress response that impact on mutant huntingtin accumulation. Furthermore, dysfunction
of the ER stress response has been involved in a variety of pathologies, including type 2
diabetes and neurodegeneration (Scheper and Hoozemans, 2009, Curr Med Chem, 16,
615-26). Thus, without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that guanabenz and
related compounds have a protective effect against secondary UPR disorders, namely
disorders due to an accumulation of a non-ER resident misfolded protein, which induces
the UPR.
Diabetes
As disclosed, the compound of formula (1)may be for use in treating diabetes, more
preferably type 2 diabetes.
The insulin-secreting p-cells in the pancreas have a heavy and tightly regulated
biosynthetic burden consisting in insulin secretion. Thus, these cells have an important
need to maintain ER homeostasis (Back and Kaufman, 2012, Annu Rev Biochem, 81,
767-93). Type 2 diabetes is manifested by increased levels of blood glucose due to insulin
resistance in the adipose, muscle and liver and/or impaired insulin secretion from
pancreatic p-cells. As a response, p-cells mass increase and their function is enhanced.
Eventually, the burden on the p-cells is too high leading to their progressive decline and
death. Increasing evidence reveals that death of p-cells results from ER stress (Back and
Kaufman, 2012, Annu Rev Biochem, 81, 767-93). Importantly, Chop deletion improves p
cells function in diverse models of diabetes (Song et al., 2008, J Clin Invest, 118, 3378
89). Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that inhibitors of PPP1 R1 5A-PP1
will improve p-cells function in type 2 diabetes since inhibition of PPP1 R1 5A-PP1 reduces
the levels of the pro-apoptotic protein CHOP during ER stress (Tsaytler et al., 2011,
Science, 332, 91-4).
Cancer
As disclosed, the compound of formula (1)may be for use in treating cancer.
Cancer cells have high metabolic requirement and their proliferation relies on efficient
protein synthesis. Translation initiation plays a crucial role in controlling protein
homeostasis, differentiation, proliferation and malignant transformation. Increasing
translation initiation contributes to cancer initiation and conversely, decreasing translation
initiation could reduce tumor growth (Donze et al., 1995, EMBO J, 14, 3828-34; Pervin et
                                                             21

al., 2008, Cancer Res, 68, 4862-74; Chen et al., 2011, Nat Chem Biol, 7, 610-6). Without
wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that inhibiting PPP1 R1 5A could selectively
reduce translation in tumor cells and thus reduce tumor growth.
Aging
Aging is known to impair stress responses and in particular, the UPR is impaired with age
(Naidoo et al., 2008, J Neurosci, 28, 6539-48). Thus, prolonging the beneficial effect of the
UPR by inhibition of elF2a phosphatase could ameliorate age-related disorders.
PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS
For use according to the present invention, the compounds or physiologically acceptable
salts, esters or other physiologically functional derivatives thereof, described herein, may
be presented as a pharmaceutical formulation, comprising the compounds or
physiologically acceptable salt, ester or other physiologically functional derivative thereof,
together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers therefore and optionally
other therapeutic and/or prophylactic ingredients. The carrier(s) must be acceptable in the
sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not deleterious
to the recipient thereof. The pharmaceutical compositions may be for human or animal
usage in human and veterinary medicine.
Examples of such suitable excipients for the various different forms of pharmaceutical
compositions described herein may be found in the "Handbook of Pharmaceutical
Excipients,              2 nd  Edition, (1994), Edited by A Wade and PJ Weller.
Acceptable carriers or diluents for therapeutic use are well known in the pharmaceutical
art, and are described, for example, in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mack
Publishing Co. (A. R. Gennaro edit. 1985).
Examples of suitable carriers include lactose, starch, glucose, methyl cellulose,
magnesium stearate, mannitol, sorbitol and the like. Examples of suitable diluents include
ethanol, glycerol and water.
The choice of pharmaceutical carrier, excipient or diluent can be selected with regard to
the intended route of administration and standard pharmaceutical practice. The
pharmaceutical compositions may comprise as, or in addition to, the carrier, excipient or
                                                            22

solubilising agent(s), buffer(s), flavouring agent(s), surface active agent(s), thickener(s),
preservative(s) (including anti-oxidants) and the like, and substances included for the
purpose of rendering the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient.
Examples of suitable binders include starch, gelatin, natural sugars such as glucose,
anhydrous lactose, free-flow lactose, beta-lactose, corn sweeteners, natural and synthetic
gums, such as acacia, tragacanth or sodium alginate, carboxymethyl cellulose and
polyethylene glycol.
Examples of suitable lubricants include sodium oleate, sodium stearate, magnesium
stearate, sodium benzoate, sodium acetate, sodium chloride and the like.
Preservatives, stabilizers, dyes and even flavoring agents may be provided in the
pharmaceutical composition. Examples of preservatives include sodium benzoate, sorbic
acid and esters of p-hydroxybenzoic acid. Antioxidants and suspending agents may be
also used.
Pharmaceutical formulations include those suitable for oral, topical (including dermal,
buccal, ocular and sublingual), rectal or parenteral (including subcutaneous, intradermal,
intramuscular and intravenous), nasal, intra-ocularly and pulmonary administration e.g., by
inhalation. The formulation may, where appropriate, be conveniently presented in discrete
dosage units and may be prepared by any of the methods well known in the art of
pharmacy. All methods include the step of bringing into association an active compound
with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both and then, if necessary, shaping
the product into the desired formulation.
Pharmaceutical formulations suitable for oral administration wherein the carrier is a solid
are most preferably presented as unit dose formulations such as boluses, capsules or
tablets each containing a predetermined amount of active compound. A tablet may be
made by compression or moulding, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients.
Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine an active
compound in a free-flowing form such as a powder or granules optionally mixed with a
binder, lubricant, inert diluent, lubricating agent, surface-active agent or dispersing agent.
Moulded tablets may be made by moulding an active compound with an inert liquid
                                                            23

diluent. Tablets may be optionally coated and, if uncoated, may optionally be scored.
Capsules may be prepared by filling an active compound, either alone or in admixture with
one or more accessory ingredients, into the capsule shells and then sealing them in the
usual manner. Cachets are analogous to capsules wherein an active compound together
with any accessory ingredient(s) is sealed in a rice paper envelope. An active compound
may also be formulated as dispersible granules, which may for example be suspended in
water before administration, or sprinkled on food. The granules may be packaged, e.g., in
a sachet. Formulations suitable for oral administration wherein the carrier is a liquid may
be presented as a solution or a suspension in an aqueous or non-aqueous liquid, or as an
oil-in-water liquid emulsion.
Formulations for oral administration include controlled release dosage forms, e.g., tablets
wherein an active compound is formulated in an appropriate release - controlling matrix,
or is coated with a suitable release - controlling film. Such formulations may be particularly
convenient for prophylactic use.
Pharmaceutical formulations suitable for rectal administration wherein the carrier is a solid
are most preferably presented as unit dose suppositories. Suitable carriers include cocoa
butter and other materials commonly used in the art. The suppositories may be
conveniently formed by admixture of an active compound with the softened or melted
carrier(s) followed by chilling and shaping in moulds.
Pharmaceutical formulations suitable for parenteral administration include sterile solutions
or suspensions of an active compound in aqueous or oleaginous vehicles.
Pharmaceutical formulations of the invention are suitable for ophthalmic administration, in
particular for intra-ocular, topical ocular or peri-ocular administration, more preferably for
topical ocular or peri-ocular administration.
Injectible preparations may be adapted for bolus injection or continuous infusion. Such
preparations are conveniently presented in unit dose or multi-dose containers which are
sealed after introduction of the formulation until required for use. Alternatively, an active
compound may be in powder form which is constituted with a suitable vehicle, such as
sterile, pyrogen-free water, before use.

An active compound may also be formulated as long-acting depot preparations, which
may be administered by intramuscular injection or by implantation, e.g., subcutaneously or
intramuscularly. Depot preparations may include, for example, suitable polymeric or
hydrophobic materials, or ion-exchange resins. Such long-acting formulations are
particularly convenient for prophylactic use.
Formulations suitable for pulmonary administration via the buccal cavity are presented
such that particles containing an active compound and desirably having a diameter in the
range of 0.5 to 7 microns are delivered in the bronchial tree of the recipient. As one
possibility such formulations are in the form of finely comminuted powders which may
conveniently be presented either in a pierceable capsule, suitably of, for example, gelatin,
for use in an inhalation device, or alternatively as a self-propelling formulation comprising
an active compound, a suitable liquid or gaseous propellant and optionally other
ingredients such as a surfactant and/or a solid diluent. Suitable liquid propellants include
propane and the chlorofluorocarbons, and suitable gaseous propellants include carbon
dioxide. Self-propelling formulations may also be employed wherein an active compound
is dispensed in the form of droplets of solution or suspension.
Such self-propelling formulations are analogous to those known in the art and may be
prepared by established procedures. Suitably they are presented in a container provided
with either a manually-operable or automatically functioning valve having the desired
spray characteristics; advantageously the valve is of a metered type delivering a fixed
volume, for example, 25 to 100 microlitres, upon each operation thereof.
As a further possibility an active compound may be in the form of a solution or suspension
for use in an atomizer or nebuliser whereby an accelerated airstream or ultrasonic
agitation is employed to produce a fine droplet mist for inhalation.
Formulations suitable for nasal administration include preparations generally similar to
those described above for pulmonary administration. When dispensed such formulations
should desirably have a particle diameter in the range 10 to 200 microns to enable
retention in the nasal cavity; this may be achieved by, as appropriate, use of a powder of
a suitable particle size or choice of an appropriate valve. Other suitable formulations
include coarse powders having a particle diameter in the range 20 to 500 microns, for
administration by rapid inhalation through the nasal passage from a container held close
                                                            25

up to the nose, and nasal drops comprising 0.2 to 5% w/v of an active compound in
aqueous or oily solution or suspension.
Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers are well known to those skilled in the art and
include, but are not limited to, 0.1 M and preferably 0.05 M phosphate buffer or 0.8%
saline. Additionally, such pharmaceutically acceptable carriers may be aqueous or non
aqueous solutions, suspensions, and emulsions. Examples of non-aqueous solvents are
propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, vegetable oils such as olive oil, and injectable
organic esters such as ethyl oleate. Aqueous carriers include water, alcoholic/aqueous
solutions, emulsions or suspensions, including saline and buffered media. Parenteral
vehicles include sodium chloride solution, Ringer's dextrose, dextrose and sodium
chloride, lactated Ringer's or fixed oils. Preservatives and other additives may also be
present, such as, for example, antimicrobials, antioxidants, chelating agents, inert gases
and the like.
Formulations suitable for topical formulation may be provided for example as gels, creams
or ointments. Such preparations may be applied e.g. to a wound or ulcer either directly
spread upon the surface of the wound or ulcer or carried on a suitable support such as a
bandage, gauze, mesh or the like which may be applied to and over the area to be
treated.
Liquid or powder formulations may also be provided which can be sprayed or sprinkled
directly onto the site to be treated, e.g. a wound or ulcer. Alternatively, a carrier such as a
bandage, gauze, mesh or the like can be sprayed or sprinkle with the formulation and then
applied to the site to be treated.
According to a further aspect of the invention, there is provided a process for the
preparation of a pharmaceutical or veterinary composition as described above, the
process comprising bringing the active compound(s) into association with the carrier, for
example by admixture.
In general, the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into
association the active agent with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both, and
then if necessary shaping the product. The invention extends to methods for preparing a
pharmaceutical composition comprising bringing a compound of general formula (1) in
                                                             26

vehicle.
SALTS/ESTERS
The compounds of the invention can be present as salts or esters, in particular
pharmaceutically and veterinarily acceptable salts or esters.
Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of the invention include suitable acid
addition or base salts thereof. A review of suitable pharmaceutical salts may be found in
Berge et al, J Pharm Sci, 66, 1-19 (1977). Salts are formed, for example with strong
inorganic acids such as mineral acids, e.g. hydrohalic acids such as hydrochloride,
hydrobromide and hydroiodide, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid sulphate, bisulphate,
hemisulphate, thiocyanate, persulphate and sulphonic acids; with strong organic
carboxylic acids, such as alkanecarboxylic acids of 1 to 4 carbon atoms which are
unsubstituted or substituted (e.g., by halogen), such as acetic acid; with saturated or
unsaturated dicarboxylic acids, for example oxalic, malonic, succinic, maleic, fumaric,
phthalic or tetraphthalic; with hydroxycarboxylic acids, for example ascorbic, glycolic,
lactic, malic, tartaric or citric acid; with aminoacids, for example aspartic or glutamic acid;
with benzoic acid; or with organic sulfonic acids, such as (C-C4)-alkyl- or aryl-sulfonic
acids which are unsubstituted or substituted (for example, by a halogen) such as
methane- or p-toluene sulfonic acid. Salts which are not pharmaceutically or veterinarily
acceptable may still be valuable as intermediates.
Preferred salts include, for example, acetate, trifluoroacetate, lactate, gluconate, citrate,
tartrate, maleate, malate, pantothenate, adipate, alginate, aspartate, benzoate, butyrate,
digluconate, cyclopentanate, glucoheptanate, glycerophosphate, oxalate, heptanoate,

ENANTIOMERS/TAUTOMERS
In all aspects of the present invention previously discussed, the invention includes, where
appropriate all enantiomers, diastereoisomers and tautomers of the compounds of the
invention. The person skilled in the art will recognise compounds that possess optical
properties (one or more chiral carbon atoms) or tautomeric characteristics. The
corresponding enantiomers and/or tautomers may be isolated/prepared by methods
known in the art. Enantiomers are characterised by the absolute configuration of their
chiral centres and described by the R- and S-sequencing rules of Cahn, Ingold and
Prelog. Such conventions are well known in the art (e.g. see 'Advanced Organic
Chemistry',               3 rd  edition, ed. March, J., John Wiley and Sons, New York, 1985).
Compounds of formula (1)thus also include the tautomer forms of formula:
         R1                                         R3

Compounds of the invention containing a chiral centre may be used as a racemic mixture,
an enantiomerically enriched mixture, or the racemic mixture may be separated using
well-known techniques and an individual enantiomer may be used alone.
STEREO AND GEOMETRIC ISOMERS
Some of the compounds of the invention may exist as stereoisomers and/or geometric
isomers - e.g. they may possess one or more asymmetric and/or geometric centres and
so may exist in two or more stereoisomeric and/or geometric forms. The present invention
contemplates the use of all the individual stereoisomers and geometric isomers of those
inhibitor agents, and mixtures thereof. The terms used in the claims encompass these
forms, provided said forms retain the appropriate functional activity (though not
necessarily to the same degree).
The present invention also includes all suitable isotopic variations of the agent or a
pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. An isotopic variation of an agent of the present
invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof is defined as one in which at least
one atom is replaced by an atom having the same atomic number but an atomic mass
different from the atomic mass usually found in nature. Examples of isotopes that can be
incorporated into the agent and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof include
isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, sulfur, fluorine and chlorine
such as 2 H, 3 H, 13C,                       C,1    5
                                                      N, 170 180 31
                                                                    p, 32
                                                                          p, 35S, 18
                                                                                     F and  36C,  respectively. Certain
isotopic variations of the agent and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, for
example, those in which a radioactive isotope such as                                 3H or  14C is incorporated, are useful
in drug and/or substrate tissue distribution studies. Tritiated, i.e., 3 H, and carbon-14, i.e.,
14C, isotopes are particularly preferred for their ease of preparation and
                                                                                                         detectability.
Further, substitution with isotopes such as deuterium, i.e., 2 H, may afford certain
therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example, increased
in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements and hence may be preferred in some
circumstances. For example, the invention includes compounds of general formula (1)
where any hydrogen atom has been replaced by a deuterium atom. Isotopic variations of
the agent of the present invention and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof of this
invention can generally be prepared by conventional procedures using appropriate
isotopic variations of suitable reagents.
                                                                        29

PRODRUGS
The compounds of the present invention may be in prodrug form, i.e. covalently bonded
compounds which release the active parent drug according to general formula (1)in vivo.
Such prodrugs are generally compounds of the invention wherein one or more appropriate
groups have been modified such that the modification may be reversed upon
administration to a human or mammalian subject. Reversion is usually performed by an
enzyme naturally present in such subject, though it is possible for a second agent to be
administered together with such a prodrug in order to perform the reversion in vivo.
Examples of such modifications include ester (for example, any of those described
above), wherein the reversion may be carried out be an esterase etc. Other such systems
will be well known to those skilled in the art.
SOLVATES
The compounds of the present invention may be in solvate forms
POLYMORPHS
The compounds of the invention may be in their various crystalline forms, polymorphic
forms and (an)hydrous forms. It is well established within the pharmaceutical industry that
chemical compounds may be isolated in any of such forms by slightly varying the method
of purification and or isolation form the solvents used in the synthetic preparation of such
compounds.
ADMINISTRATION
The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may be adapted for rectal,
nasal, intrabronchial, topical (including buccal, sublingual and ophthalmic administration,
in particular for intra-ocular, topical ocular or peri-ocular administration), vaginal or
parenteral (including subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous, intraarterial and
intradermal), intraperitoneal or intrathecal administration. Preferably the formulation is an
orally administered formulation. The formulations may conveniently be presented in unit
dosage form, i.e., in the form of discrete portions containing a unit dose, or a multiple or
sub-unit of a unit dose. By way of example, the formulations may be in the form of tablets
and sustained release capsules, and may be prepared by any method well known in the
art of pharmacy.

  \rbr\Interwoven\NRPortbl\DCC\RBR\16110457_l.docx-4 12/2017
Formulations for oral administration in the present invention may be presented as:
discrete units such as capsules, gellules, drops, cachets, pills or tablets each containing a
predetermined amount of the active agent; as a powder or granules; as a solution,
emulsion or a suspension of the active agent in an aqueous liquid or a non-aqueous
liquid; or as an oil-in-water liquid emulsion or a water-in-oil liquid emulsion; or as a bolus
etc. Preferably, these compositions contain from 1 to 250 mg and more preferably from
10-100 mg, of active ingredient per dose.
For compositions for oral administration (e.g. tablets and capsules), the term "acceptable
carrier" includes vehicles such as common excipients e.g. binding agents, for example
syrup, acacia, gelatin, sorbitol, tragacanth, polyvinylpyrrolidone (Povidone),
methylcellulose, ethylcellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose,
hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, sucrose and starch; fillers and carriers, for example corn
starch, gelatin, lactose, sucrose, microcrystalline cellulose, kaolin, mannitol, dicalcium
phosphate, sodium chloride and alginic acid; and lubricants such as magnesium stearate,
sodium stearate and other metallic stearates, glycerol stearate stearic acid, silicone fluid,
talc waxes, oils and colloidal silica. Flavouring agents such as peppermint, oil of
wintergreen, cherry flavouring and the like can also be used. It may be desirable to add a
colouring agent to make the dosage form readily identifiable. Tablets may also be coated
by methods well known in the art.
A tablet may be made by compression or moulding, optionally with one or more accessory
ingredients. Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine
the active agent in a free flowing form such as a powder or granules, optionally mixed with
a binder, lubricant, inert diluent, preservative, surface-active or dispersing agent. Moulded
tablets may be made by moulding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered
compound moistened with an inert liquid diluent. The tablets may be optionally be coated
or scored and may be formulated so as to provide slow or controlled release of the active
agent.
Other formulations suitable for oral administration include lozenges comprising the active
agent in a flavoured base, usually sucrose and acacia or tragacanth; pastilles comprising
the active agent in an inert base such as gelatin and glycerin, or sucrose and acacia; and
mouthwashes comprising the active agent in a suitable liquid carrier.
                                                             31

Other forms of administration comprise solutions or emulsions which may be injected
intravenously, intraarterially, intrathecally, subcutaneously, intradermally, intraperitoneally,
intra-ocularly, topical, peri-ocularly or intramuscularly, and which are prepared from sterile
or sterilisable solutions. Injectable forms typically contain between 10 - 1000 mg,
preferably between 10 - 250 mg, of active ingredient per dose.
The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may also be in form of
suppositories, pessaries, suspensions, emulsions, lotions, ointments, creams, gels,
sprays, solutions or dusting powders.
An alternative means of transdermal administration is by use of a skin patch. For example,
the active ingredient can be incorporated into a cream consisting of an aqueous emulsion
of polyethylene glycols or liquid paraffin. The active ingredient can also be incorporated, at
a concentration of between 1 and 10% by weight, into an ointment consisting of a white
wax or white soft paraffin base together with such stabilisers and preservatives as may be
required.
DOSAGE
A person of ordinary skill in the art can easily determine an appropriate dose of one of the
instant compositions to administer to a subject without undue experimentation. Typically, a
physician will determine the actual dosage which will be most suitable for an individual
patient and it will depend on a variety of factors including the activity of the specific
compound employed, the metabolic stability and length of action of that compound, the
age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, mode and time of administration, rate of
excretion, drug combination, the severity of the particular condition, and the individual
undergoing therapy. The dosages disclosed herein are exemplary of the average case.
There can of course be individual instances where higher or lower dosage ranges are
merited, and such are within the scope of this invention.
In accordance with this invention, an effective amount of a compound of general formula
(1)may be administered to target a particular condition or disease. Of course, this dosage
amount will further be modified according to the type of administration of the compound.
For example, to achieve an "effective amount" for acute therapy, parenteral administration
of a compound of general formula (1)is preferred. An intravenous infusion of the
compound in 5% dextrose in water or normal saline, or a similar formulation with suitable
                                                            32

excipients, is most effective, although an intramuscular bolus injection is also useful.
Typically, the parenteral dose will be about 0.01 to about 100 mg/kg; preferably between
0.1 and 20 mg/kg, in a manner to maintain the concentration of drug in the plasma at an
effective concentration The compounds may be administered one to four times daily at a
level to achieve a total daily dose of about 0.4 to about 400 mg/kg/day. The precise
amount of an inventive compound which is therapeutically effective, and the route by
which such compound is best administered, is readily determined by one of ordinary skill
in the art by comparing the blood level of the agent to the concentration required to have a
therapeutic effect.
The compounds of this invention may also be administered orally to the patient, in a
manner such that the concentration of drug is sufficient to achieve one or more of the
therapeutic indications disclosed herein. Typically, a pharmaceutical composition
containing the compound is administered at an oral dose of between about 0.1 to about
50 mg/kg in a manner consistent with the condition of the patient. Preferably the oral dose
would be about 0.1 to about 20 mg/kg.
No unacceptable toxicological effects are expected when compounds of the present
invention are administered in accordance with the present invention. The compounds of
this invention, which may have good bioavailability, may be tested in one of several
biological assays to determine the concentration of a compound which is required to have
a given pharmacological effect.
COMBINATIONS
In a particularly preferred embodiment, the one or more compounds of the invention are
administered in combination with one or more other active agents, for example, existing
drugs available on the market. In such cases, the compounds of the invention may be
administered consecutively, simultaneously or sequentially with the one or more other
active agents.
Drugs in general are more effective when used in combination. In particular, combination
therapy is desirable in order to avoid an overlap of major toxicities, mechanism of action
and resistance mechanism(s). Furthermore, it is also desirable to administer most drugs
at their maximum tolerated doses with minimum time intervals between such doses. The
major advantages of combining drugs are that it may promote additive or possible
                                                            33

synergistic effects through biochemical interactions and also may decrease the
emergence of resistance.
Beneficial combinations may be suggested by studying the inhibitory activity of the test
compounds with agents known or suspected of being valuable in the treatment of a
particular disorder. This procedure can also be used to determine the order of
administration of the agents, i.e. before, simultaneously, or after delivery. Such scheduling
may be a feature of all the active agents identified herein.
ASSAY
It is also disclosed the use of a compound as described above in an assay for identifying
further candidate compounds capable of inhibiting PPP1 R1 5A-PP1.
Preferably, the assay is a competitive binding assay.
More preferably, the competitive binding assay comprises contacting a compound of the
invention with PPP1R15A-PP1 and a candidate compound and detecting any change in
the interaction between the compound according to the invention and the PPP1 R1 5A
PP1.
Preferably, the candidate compound is generated by conventional SAR modification of a
compound of the invention.
As used herein, the term "conventional SAR modification" refers to standard methods
known in the art for varying a given compound by way of chemical derivatisation.
Thus, the identified compound may act as a model (for example, a template) for the
development of other compounds. The compounds employed in such a test may be free
in solution, affixed to a solid support, borne on a cell surface, or located intracellularly. The
abolition of activity or the formation of binding complexes between the compound and the
agent being tested may be measured.
The assay may be a screen, whereby a number of agents are tested. In one aspect, the
assay method of the present invention is a high through-put screen.

PPP1 R1 5A-PP1.
Compounds of general formula (1)are useful both as laboratory tools and as therapeutic
agents. In the laboratory certain compounds of the invention are useful in establishing
whether a known or newly discovered target contributes a critical or at least significant
biochemical function during the establishment or progression of a disease state, a process
commonly referred to as 'target validation'.

In some of the experiments below, the salt of these compounds may be used; for
example, the acetate salt of example 1 formed with acetic acid may be used.
Cytoprotection from ER stress (Test 1)
HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM) supplemented
with penicillin, streptomycin, containing 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS), at 37 OC in 5% C02
atmosphere. Cells were plated in 24 well plates at a density of 15,000 cells/ml 24 hours
prior treatment. ER stress was elicited by addition of fresh media containing 2.5 pg/ml
tunicamycin (Sigma-Aldrich) together with elF2a phosphatases inhibitors (0.2-5pM).
Media were changed 6 h later with fresh media containing phosphatase inhibitors (0.2
5pM). Inhibitors were dissolved in DMSO (50 mM) and DMSO was used as a mock
treatment. Cell viability was assessed by measuring the reduction of WST-8 [2-(2
methoxy-4-nitrophenyl)-3-(4-nitrophenyl)-5-(2,4-disulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium] into
formazan using Cell viability Counting Kit-8 (Dojindo) according to the supplier's
recommendation, 48 h after tunicamycin treatment. Cytoprotection from ER stress is
measured in terms of the percentage increase in viable cells (relative to control) after ER
stress. The result for Example 1 of the invention is shown in Figure 1.
Assessment of translation rates in unstressed cells (Test 2)
HeLa cells (80,000 cells/ml) were plated in 12-well plates 24 h before each experiment
and either untreated or treated with compounds (50 pM) for 0.5, 1, 2.5, 5 and 7.5 h. At the
end of each time point, 30.6 pCi/ml                              35S-methionine (EasyTag, PerkinElmer) was added to
the culture medium for 10 min at 37 *C. Following labelling, cells were washed with ice
cold PBS and lysed in 75 pl Laemmli Buffer. Lysates were sonicated, boiled at 95 *C for 5
                                                                         42

min and resolved on NuPAGE 4-12% gradient gels. Gels were then stained with
Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 and analyzed by phosphorimaging.
Assessment of translation rates in stressed cells (Test 3)
Treatments were performed as for measuring translation in unstressed cells, except that
Tunicamycin (2.5 pg/ml) was added together with the compounds. The result for Example
1 of the invention is shown in Figure 3.
Immunoprecipitations (Test 4)
HeLa cells (80,000 cells/ml) were plated the day before the indicated treatments,
transfected with GFP-PPP1R15A or FLAG-PPP1R15B expression plasmids using
Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's procedure. Two days
following transfection, cells were treated for 6 h with compounds (50 pM) and then
washed in PBS and lysed in IP buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 0.2% Triton X
100, 10% glycerol, and EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail). Lysates were clarified by
centrifugation at 15,000g for 15 min at 4 IC and pre-cleared on protein G beads for 1 hour
at 4 IC. Proteins were immunoprecipitated with 1.5 pl GFP antibody (JL-8, Clontech,
632380), bound to 20 pl of protein-G-sepharose beads (GE Healthcare, 17-0618-01). The
beads were then washed 3 times with cold IP buffer and boiled in 50 pl Laemmli Buffer
(25 mM Tris-HCI pH 6.8, 1% SDS, 25 mM DTT, 7.5% Glycerol, 0.05% Bromophenol blue).
The immunoprecipitated protein complexes (17 pl) were separated on 4-12% NuPAGE
gradient gels (Invitrogen), transferred to Optitran BA-S 83 reinforced Nitrocellulose
membrane and revealed with GFP and PP1 antibodies (sc-7482, Santa Cruz).
Functional aequorin assay for Adrenergic a2A receptor (Test 5)
CHO-K1 cells coexpressing mitochondrial apoaequorin, Ga16 and recombinant human
Adrenergic a2A receptor grown to mid-log phase in culture media without antibiotics were
detached with PBS-EDTA, centrifuged and resuspended in DMEM/HAM's F12 with
HEPES, without phenol red + 0.1% BSA protease free buffer at a concentration of 1x106
cells/ml. Cells were incubated at room temperature for at least 4h with coelenterazine h.
On each day of the test, reference agonist (UK14304) was tested to evaluate the
performance of the assay and determine EC50 . Then, 50pl of cell suspension was mixed
with 50pl of test agonist in a 96-well plate. The resulting emission of light was recorded
using Hamamatsu Functional Drug Screening System 6000 luminometer. To standardize
the emission of recorded light (determination of the "100% signal") across plate and
                                                             43

Dose-response data from test compounds were analysed with XLfit (IDBS) software using
nonlinear regression applied to a sigmoidal dose-response model.
The result for Example 1 of the invention is shown in Figure 4. Advantageously, in
contrast to Guanabenz, Example 1 is not considered to be a potent alpha-2 agonist. This
loss in alpha-2 adrenergic activity renders the compound therapeutically useful in the
treatment of the disorders claimed herein. The absence of alpha-2 adrenergic activity
means that the compound can be administered at a dosage suitable to treat the disorders
claimed herein, but without any significant effect on blood pressure, thereby avoiding the
need to co-administer with a known alpha-2 adrenergic antagonist (an alpha blocker).
Selectivity assessment
Selectivity was inferred from the results of test 1, 2, 3, and 5:
A selective inhibitor of PPP1 R15A should, protect cells from ER stress (Test 1), does not
inhibit translation in non-stressed cells (Test 2), prolongs translation attenuation after
Tunicamycin (Test 3), and selectively dissociates PPP1R15A-PP1 holophosphatase but
not PPP1R15b-PP1 holophosphatase (Test 4).

Cell-based assays:
Material and Methods
Cell Culture and Reagents 293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's
medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and transfected in 6- or 12- well
plates by using the calcium phosphate method leading usually to 70% transfection
efficiency. Routinely, 45,000 cells/ml were plated before transfection as described in
(Rousseau et al. 2009). Myelin POS63del-DSred construct was described in (Pennuto et
al. 2008), the Huntingtin construct was described in (Rousseau et al. 2009), the SOD1A4V
construct is described in (MOnch et al. 2011) and the P23H construct is described in
(Mendes and Cheetham 2008).
Fluorescence Microscopy
Transfected cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and labeled with indicated
antibodies. Micrographs were taken at 1OOX magnification on a Leica TCS SP2AOBS
confocal microscope or Leica DMRB Fluorescence microscope.
                                                                          45

Immunoblotting
Routinely, 70% confluent cells from a well of a 12-well plate were lysed in 140 tl of boiling
Laemmli buffer (25 mM Tris-HCI, pH 6.8, 1% SDS, 25 mM dithiothreitol, 7.5% glycerol,
0.05% bromphenol blue) for immunoblot analysis. 18 |' of protein extracts were loaded on
2-12% NuPAGE gels and transferred to Optitran BA-S 83 reinforced nitrocellulose
membrane (Whatman and Schleicher & Schuell). Equal loading of protein extracts
analyzed by immunoblot was controlled by Ponceau Red staining and vimentin (data not
shown). Membranes were satutated in 5% dried skimmed milk in phosphate-buffered
saline and probed with Htt 2b4 antibody or HA antibody to reveal HA-tagged SOD1. The
appropriate secondary antibody coupled to peroxidase was revealed using the
SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent kit (Pierce). Chemiluminescent images were
acquired using the Chemi-Smart 5000 (Vilber-Lourmat) allowing quantitative detection of
chemilumi-nescence. Signals of interest were quantified using ImageJ.
Assay for Charcot Marie Tooth 1B (Test 6)
Deletion of serine 63 from PO (POS63del) causes Charcot-Marie-Tooth 1B neuropathy in
humans and a similar demyelinating neuropathy in transgenic mice. The mutant protein
misfolds and accumulates in the ER, induces the UPR and fails to be incorporated into
myelin (D'Antonio et al., 2009, J Neurosci Res, 87, 3241-9). 293T cells were transfected
with labeled POS63 del - POS63del-DSred - and analyzed by confocal microscopy, 48h
post-transfection in the presence or absence of compound of formula (1). In accordance
with the methodology described in (Pennuto et al. 2008), cells with ER-retained POS63del
DSred were scored . Figure 4 shows that in untreated cells, POS63del accumulates in the
ER but Example 1 prevents this accumulation. Since accumulation of misfolded PO
causes CMT-1 B and having shown that Example 1reduces accumulation of the disease
causing protein, the compound of formula (1)should be useful to treat CMT-1 B as well as
other forms of CMT where the disease causing-protein is misfolded and retained in the
ER.
Assay for Huntington's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Test 7)
We tested for accumulation of mutant huntingtin amino-terminal fragment (Htt48Q)
associated with Huntington's disease and SOD1 mutant (A4V), associated with
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

  \rbr\Interwoven\NRPortbl\DCC\RBR\16110457_l.docx-4 12/2017
We used a method previously described in WO/2008/041133. 293T cells were transfected
with plasmids encoding for Htt48 or SOD1A 4V and treated with Example 1in DMSO or
DMSO alone 4 h post-transfection. SDS lysates collected 48 h post-transfection were
analyzed on a NuPAGE followed by immunoblot with Huntingtin antibody (2B4) or HA
(SOD1). Figure 5 shows the quantifications of the signal on immunoblots, normalized to
untreated cells. Example reduces accumulation of both proteins. Having shown that
Example 1reduces accumulation of the proteins causing Huntington's disease and
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, the compound of formula (1)should be useful to treat such
diseases as well as other neurodegenerative diseases caused by accumulation of
misfolded proteins.
Assay for rhodopsin P23H aggregation (Test 8)
We tested for aggregation of rhodopsin associated for retinitis pigmentosa as described
(Mendes & Cheetham 2008).
293T cells were transfected with plasmid encoding the P23H mutant of rhodopsin and
treated with Example 1 in DMSO or DMSO alone 4 h post-transfection. Cells were
analyzed by microscopy. Figure 6 shows the cells with or without aggregates. Example 1
reduces aggregates. Since accumulation of misfolded rhodopsin causes RP and having
shown that Example 1reduces accumulation of the disease-causing protein, the
compound of formula (1) should be useful to treat Retinitis Pigmentosa.
Examples 1 and 6 are confirmed selective inhibitors of PPP1R15A.
Examples 2,4,7,8 inhibit both PPP1R15A and B.
