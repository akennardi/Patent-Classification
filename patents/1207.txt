OVERVIEW
[0014]      The present inventor has recognized that mobile devices can provide a mechanism to
streamline payments at a physical location using check-in type processing. Mobile payment
processing is slowing being adopted by consumers and merchants. The speed of adoption,
particularly by consumers is impacted by complexity and a perceived lack of security. The
systems and methods of check-in based payment processing using a mobile device streamlines
the process and provides a high-level of security, among other things.
[0015]      The following, non-limiting examples detail certain aspects of the present systems
and methods.
[0016]      Example 1 can include a method for check-in based payment processing. The method
can include receiving check-in data, generating a pre-approval, sending a one-time-use PIN,
receiving a validated transaction, and processing a payment. The check-in data can include a
merchant identifier and user information identifying a user registered with the check-in service
and associated with a mobile device. The pre-approval can include a one-time-user PIN. The
validated transaction can include the one-time-user PIN associated with the pre-approval. The
payment processed affects payment between the user and the merchant based on the validated
transaction.
[0017]      In Example 2, the method of Example 1 can optionally include receiving, from the
merchant over the network, transaction information detailing a pending transaction between the
merchant and the user, the transaction information including the one-time-use PIN.
[0018]      In Example 3, the method of Example 2 can optionally include validating the pending
transaction at least in part by verifying that the one-time-use PIN received from the merchant
matches the one-time-use PIN generated as part of the pre-approval.
                                                2

WO 2013/115853                                                                PCT/US2012/055195
[0019]       In Example 4, the method of Example 3 can optionally include validating the pending
transaction by decrypting the one-time-use PIN received from the merchant.
[0020]       In Example 5, the method of any one of Examples 1 through 4 can optionally include
setting an expiration period for the one-time-use PIN during pre-approval generation.
[0021]       In Example 6, the method of any one of Examples 1 through 5 can optionally include
setting an expiration event for the one-time-use PIN during pre-approval generation.
[0022]       In Example, 7, the method of Example 6 can optionally include setting a subsequent
check-in associated with the user at a different physical location as the expiration event for the
one-time-use PIN.
[0023]       In Example 8, the method of any one of Examples 1 through 7 can optionally include
sending the one-time-use PIN in a text message to the mobile device.
[0024]       In Example 9, the method of any one of Examples 1 through 8 can optionally include
sending, to the merchant over a network, the check-in data including a secondary user identifier
to assist the merchant in interacting with the user.
[0025]       In Example 10, the method of Example 9 can optionally include sending, to the
merchant as part of the check-in data or in addition to the check-in data, a picture of the user as
the secondary user identifier.
[0026]       Example 11 can include a machine-readable storage medium including instructions
that, when executed by a machine, can cause the machine to perform any one of the Examples 1
through 10.
[0027]       Example 12 can include a system for providing check-in based payment processing.
The system can include a server with one or more processors configured to execute a plurality of
modules. The plurality of modules can include a check-in service module, an authentication
module, and a settlement module. The check-in service module can be configured to receive,
from a check-in service, check-in data, the check-in data including a merchant identifier and user
information identifying a user registered with the check-in service and associated with a mobile
device. The authentication module can be configured to generate a pre-approval for a transaction
between a merchant identified by the merchant identifier and the user, the pre-approval including
a one-time-use PIN. The authentication module can also be configured to send, to the mobile
device over a network, at least the one-time-use PIN. The authentication module can yet further
be configured to receive, from the merchant over the network, a validated transaction, the
validated transaction including the one-time-use PIN associated with the pre-approval. The
settlement module can be configured to process a payment from the user to the merchant based at
least in part on the validated transaction.

[0028]      In Example 13, the system of Example 12 can optionally include the settlement
module configured to receive, from the merchant over the network, transaction information
detailing a pending transaction between the merchant and the user, the transaction information
including the one-time-use PIN.
[0029]      In Example 14, the system of Example 13 can optionally include the authentication
module configured to validate the pending transaction at least in part by verifying that the one
time-use PIN received from the merchant matches the one-time-use PIN generated as part of the
pre-approval by the authentication module.
[0030]      In Example 15, the system of Example 14 can optionally include the authentication
module configured to validate the pending transaction at least in part by decrypting the one-time
use PIN received from the merchant.
[0031]      In Example 16, the system of any one of Examples 14 through 15 can optionally
include the authentication module configured to set an expiration parameter for the one-time-use
PIN during generation of the pre-approval.
[0032]      In Example 17, the system of Example 16 can optionally include the authentication
module configured to determine if the expiration parameter has been satisfied during validation
of the pending transaction.
DEFINITIONS
[0033]      Location - For the purposes of this specification and the associated claims, the term
"location" is used to refer to a geographic location, such as a longitude/latitude combination or a
street address. The term location is also used within this specification in reference to a physical
location associated with a retail outlet (e.g., store).
[0034]      Real-time - For the purposes of this specification and the associated claims, the term
"real-time" is used to refer to calculations or operations performed on-the-fly as events occur or
input is received by the operable system. However, the use of the term "real-time" is not
intended to preclude operations that cause some latency between input and response, so long as
the latency is an unintended consequence induced by the performance characteristics of the
machine.
DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0035]      Example systems and methods for enabling check-in based payment processes are
described. In some example embodiments, the systems and methods for enabling check-in based
payment processing allow a user to pre-authorize and pay via a check-in on a mobile device. In
an example, the FOURSQUARETM check-in service can be coupled to a payment service to
                                                4

WO 2013/115853                                                                 PCT/US2012/055195
enable payments via a mobile device. In the following description, for purposes of explanation,
numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of example
embodiments. It will be evident, however, to one skilled in the art that the present invention may
be practiced without these specific details. It will also be evident that a check-in based payment
system is not limited to the examples provided and may include other scenarios not specifically
discussed.
[0036]       In accordance with an example embodiment, a network-based system can provide a
platform to provide both a check-in service and payment capabilities. In certain examples, the
check-in service and the payment service can be provided by separate systems. In some
examples, the user interacts with a network-based system (e.g., check-in service and/or payment
service) via a mobile device, such as a smartphone, a tablet computing device, or an Internet
enabled personal digital assistant (PDA), among others. In an example, the network-based
system can include a publication module capable of delivering check-in based offers to a user
based on stored user profile data and local merchant campaigns. In certain examples, selecting a
check-in based offer can initiate the payment process.
[0037]       In an example, a check-in can be used to initiate a mobile payment process via a
mobile device. In this example, a check-in service, such as FOURSQUARE, can work in
cooperation with an online or mobile payment processing service, such as PAYPAL, to provide a
check-in based mobile payment system. In such as system, a merchant can authorize the
payments system to use data from its check-in account (e.g., check-ins, offers, user names, etc...)
to power payments and improve sales insights. In an example, a merchant can visit a web portal
provided by the payments system to pair a check-in account with their payment account.
Linking these accounts can enable the payments system to interact with users that check-in at
one of the merchant's physical locations via the check-in service.
[0038]       The check-in service, or in some examples the payments system, can allow the
merchant to create offers or deals for distribution to users of the check-in or payments system.
The deals can be used to attract new customers or reward existing customers, among other
things.
[0039]       In certain examples, a user can link a personal account on the payments system with
an account on the check-in service. In some examples, the user can create a new payments
system account via the check-in service or vice-versa. Once the accounts are linked, the user can
start receiving offers when checking in at various physical locations. The payments system can
also allow for streamlined payment processing via a user's mobile device using a check-in as a
pre-authorization to start the payment process with a merchant.
[0040]       In an example, the pre-authorization generated by the user's check-in expires after a
                                               5

WO 2013/115853                                                                PCT/US2012/055195
certain length of time or upon a termination event. A termination event can include a check-in at
a different physical location, among other things. Pre-authorization can include a one-time use
PIN that is communicated to the user's mobile device for use in completing a transaction with
the merchant.
[0041]      Once a check-in has occurred, the payments system can send a notification to the
merchant that a new customer has checked in. In certain examples, the payments system can
send notification to the merchant's point of sale (POS) system. In an example, the notification
can include information about the user, such as a picture, that enables identification and
interaction with the user.
[0042]      When the user is ready to complete a transaction with the merchant, such as
purchasing an offer sent as part of the check-in response, the user can enter the pre-authorization
PIN into the merchant's POS as part of the process. The merchant's POS can use the PIN in
communications with the payments system to uniquely identify the user and complete transaction
processing. In some examples, the user can manually enter the PIN or verbally provide the PIN
to the merchant. In other examples, the PIN can be communicating wirelessly to the merchant,
such as to the merchant's POS system. Upon completing a transaction the payments system can
send electronic receipts to both the merchant and the user.
EXAMPLE SYSTEM
[0043]      FIG. 1 is a block diagram depicting a system for delivering check-in based payment
processes, according to an example embodiment. The system 100 can include a user 110, a
network-based check-in system 120, a merchant 130, and a network-based payment service 140.
In an example, the user 110 can connect to the network-based check-in system 120 via a mobile
device 115 (e.g., smart phone, PDA, laptop, or similar mobile electronic device capable of some
form of data connectivity). In an example, the merchant 130 can operate computer systems, such
as an inventory system 132 or a point of sale (POS) system 134, among others. The network
based check-in system 120 can interact with any of the systems used by merchant 130 for
operation of the merchant's retail or service business. In an example, the network-based check-in
system 120 can work with both the POS system 134 and inventory system 132 to obtain access
to inventory available at individual retail locations run by the merchant and match merchandise
on which the merchant wants to offer deals via the network-based check-in service 120.
Additionally, the network-based payment service 140 can also interact with the merchant 130 via
the POS system 134, enabling the merchant 140 to provide payment services offered by the
network-based payment service 140. In certain examples, the payment server 140 and the
network-based check-in service can be combined into a single service.

WO 2013/115853                                                                PCT/US2012/055195
EXAMPLE OPERATING ENVIRONMENT
[0044]       FIG. 2 is a block diagram illustrating an environment for operating a mobile device,
according to an example embodiment. The environment 200 is an example environment within
which methods of check-in based payment process can occur. The environment 200 can include
a mobile device 115, a communication connection 210, a network 220, servers 230, a
communication satellite 270, a merchant server 280, and a database 290. The servers 230 can
optionally include location based service application 240, location determination application 250,
publication application 260, and payment application 265. The database 290 can optionally
include merchant databases 292, user profile database 294, and/or location history database 296.
The mobile device 115 represents one example device that can be utilized by a user to receive
offers and process payments. The mobile device 115 may be any of a variety of types of devices
(for example, a cellular telephone, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a Personal Navigation
Device (PND), a handheld computer, a tablet computer, a notebook computer, or other type of
movable device). The mobile device 115 may interface via a connection 210 with a
communication network 220 . Depending on the form of the mobile device 115 , any of a variety
of types of connections 210 and communication networks 220 may be used.
[0045]       For example, the connection 210 may be Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA)
connection, a Global System for Mobile communications (GSM) connection, or other type of
cellular connection. Such connection 210 may implement any of a variety of types of data
transfer technology, such as Single Carrier Radio Transmission Technology (1xRTT), Evolution
Data Optimized (EVDO) technology, General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) technology,
Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution (EDGE) technology, or other data transfer technology
(e.g., fourth generation wireless, 4G networks). When such technology is employed, the
communication network 220 may include a cellular network that has a plurality of cell sites of
overlapping geographic coverage, interconnected by cellular telephone exchanges. These cellular
telephone exchanges may be coupled to a network backbone (for example, the public switched
telephone network (PSTN), a packet-switched data network, or to other types of networks).
[0046]       In another example, the connection 210 may be Wireless Fidelity (Wi-Fi, IEEE
802.11 x type) connection, a Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX)
connection, or another type of wireless data connection. In such an embodiment, the
communication network 220 may include one or more wireless access points coupled to a local
area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), the Internet, or other packet-switched data
network.
[0047]       In yet another example, the connection 210 may be a wired connection, for example
                                               7

WO 2013/115853                                                                 PCT/US2012/055195
an Ethernet link, and the communication network may be a LAN, a WAN, the Internet, or other
packet-switched data network. Accordingly, a variety of different configurations are expressly
contemplated.
[0048]       A plurality of servers 230 may be coupled via interfaces to the communication
network 220, for example, via wired or wireless interfaces. These servers 230 may be configured
to provide various types of services to the mobile device 115. For example, one or more servers
230 may execute location based service (LBS) applications 240, which interoperate with
software executing on the mobile device 115, to provide LBSs to a user. LBSs can use
knowledge of the device's location, and/or the location of other devices, to provide location
specific information, recommendations, notifications, interactive capabilities, and/or other
functionality to a user. For example, an LBS application 240 can provide location data to a
network-based check-in system 120, which can then be used to assist in generating offers
relevant to the user's current location and enable payment via the network-based payment system
140. Knowledge of the device's location, and/or the location of other devices, may be obtained
through interoperation of the mobile device 115 with a location determination application 250
executing on one or more of the servers 230. Location information may also be provided by the
mobile device 115, without use of a location determination application, such as application 250.
In certain examples, the mobile device 115 may have some limited location determination
capabilities that are augmented by the location determination application 250. In some examples,
the servers 230 can also include publication application 260 for providing location-aware offers
that may be triggered by present or past check-ins with the network-based check-in service 120.
In certain examples, location data can be provided to the publication application 260 by the
location determination application 250. In some examples, the location data provided by the
location determination application 250 can include merchant information (e.g., identification of a
retail location). In certain examples, the location determination application 250 can receive
signals via the network 220 to further identify a location. For example, a merchant may
broadcast a specific IEEE 802.11 service set identifier (SSID) that can be interpreted by the
location determination application 250 to identify a particular retail location. In another example,
the merchant may broadcast an identification signal via radio-frequency identification (RFID),
near-field communication (NFC), or a similar protocol that can be used by the location
determination application 250.
EXAMPLE MOBILE DEVICE
[0049]       FIG. 3 is a block diagram illustrating a mobile device, according to an example
embodiment. The mobile device 115 may include a processor 310. The processor 310 may be

any of a variety of different types of commercially available processors suitable for mobile
devices (for example, an XScale architecture microprocessor, a Microprocessor without
Interlocked Pipeline Stages (MIPS) architecture processor, or another type of processor). A
memory 320, such as a Random Access Memory (RAM), a Flash memory, or other type of
memory, is typically accessible to the processor. The memory 320 may be adapted to store an
operating system (OS) 330, as well as application programs 340, such as a mobile location
enabled application that may provide LBSs to a user. The processor 310 may be coupled, either
directly or via appropriate intermediary hardware, to a display 350 and to one or more
input/output (I/O) devices 360, such as a keypad, a touch panel sensor, a microphone, and the
like. Similarly, in some embodiments, the processor 310 may be coupled to a transceiver 370 that
interfaces with an antenna 390. The transceiver 370 may be configured to both transmit and
receive cellular network signals, wireless data signals, or other types of signals via the antenna
390, depending on the nature of the mobile device 115. In this manner, the connection 210 with
the communication network 220 may be established. Further, in some configurations, a GPS
receiver 380 may also make use of the antenna 390 to receive GPS signals.

servers 424 that facilitate access to one or more databases 426. In some examples, the
application server 418 can access the databases 426 directly without the need for a database
server 424.
[0052]      The publication modules 420 may provide a number of publication functions and
services to users that access the networked system 402. The payment modules 422 may likewise
provide a number of payment services and functions to users. The payment modules 422 may
allow users to accumulate value (e.g., in a commercial currency, such as the U.S. dollar, or a
proprietary currency, such as "points") in accounts, and then later to redeem the accumulated
value for products (e.g., goods or services) that are advertised or made available via the various
publication modules 420, within retail locations, or within external online retail venues. The
payment modules 422 may also be configured to present or facilitate a redemption of offers,
generated by the location-aware offer modules 432, to a user during checkout (or prior to
checkout, while the user is still actively shopping). The payment modules 422 can also be
configured to enable check-in based payment processing. The location-aware offer modules 432
may provide real-time location-aware offers (e.g., coupons or immediate discount deals on
targeted products or services) to users of the networked system 402. The location-aware offer
modules 432 can be configured to use all of the various communication mechanisms provided by
the networked system 402 to present offer options to users. The offer options can be personalized
based on current location, time of day, user profile data, past purchase history, or recent physical
or online behaviors recorded by the network-based system 400, among other things. While the
publication modules 420, payment modules 422, and location-aware offer modules 432 are
shown in FIG. 4 to all form part of the networked system 402, it will be appreciated that, in
alternative embodiments, the payment modules 422 may form part of a payment service that is
separate and distinct from the networked system 402, such as the network-based payment service
140. Additionally, in some examples, the location-aware offer modules 432 may be part of the
payment service or may form an offer generation service separate and distinct from the
networked system 402. In certain examples, the network-based check-in service 120 can include
some or all of the application severs 418.
[0053]      Further, while the system 400 shown in FIG. 4 employs a client-server architecture,
the present invention is of course not limited to such an architecture, and could equally well find
application in a distributed, or peer-to-peer, architecture system, for example. The various
publication modules 420, payment modules 422, and location-aware offer modules 432 could
also be implemented as standalone systems or software programs, which do not necessarily have
networking capabilities.
[0054]      The web client 406 accesses the various publication modules 420, payment modules
                                               10

422, and location-aware offer modules 432 via the web interface supported by the web server
416. Similarly, the programmatic client 408 accesses the various services and functions
provided by the publication modules 420, payment modules 422, and location-aware offer
modules 432 via the programmatic interface provided by the API server 414. The programmatic
client 408 may, for example, be a smartphone application (e.g., the PAYPALTM payment
application developed by eBay, Inc., of San Jose, California) to enable users to make a various of
payments directly from their smartphones.
[0055]      FIG. 4 also illustrates a third party application 428, executing on a third party server
machine 440, as having programmatic access to the networked system 402 via the programmatic
interface provided by the API server 414. For example, the third party application 428 may,
utilizing information retrieved from the networked system 402, support one or more features or
functions on a website hosted by the third party. The third party website may, for example,
provide one or more promotional, marketplace or payment functions that are supported by the
relevant applications of the networked system 402. Additionally, the third party website may
provide merchants with access to the local pricing modules 432 for configuration purposes. In
certain examples, merchants can use programmatic interfaces provided by the API server 414 to
develop and implement rules-based pricing schemes that can be implemented via the publication
modules 420, payment modules 422, and location-aware offer modules 432.
EXAMPLE PAYMENT MODULES
[0056]      FIG. 5 is a block diagram illustrating payment modules, according to an example
embodiment. In this example, the payment modules 422 can include a check-in service module
505, a user profile module 510, an authentication engine 520, a location module 530, and a
settlement module 540. In an example, the payment modules 422 can access database 426 to
store and/or retrieve payment transaction data, user profile data, and location data, as well as
other information to enable check-in based payment processing.
[0057]      The check-in service module 505 can receive and process check-in data from a check
in service, such as the network-based check-in service 120. The user profile module 510 can
maintain user account information associated with a user of the networked system 402. The
authentication engine 520 can be configured to generate one-time use codes (PINs) that can be
used to authenticate payment requests. The authentication engine 520 can also be configured to
authenticate logins to the mobile payment application operating on a user's mobile device, such
as mobile device 115. The location module 530 can obtain location data from a mobile device or
the check-in service module 505 and provide location-based data to other modules and systems.
In an example, the location module 530 can work in conjunction with the check-in service
                                               11

WO 2013/115853                                                                 PCT/US2012/055195
module 505 to distribute location-based offers. The settlement module 540 can process
transactions to transfer funds between payment accounts and generate transaction receipts.
[0058]      Additional details regarding the functionality provided by the payment modules 422
are detailed below in reference to FIGS. 6-8.
EXAMPLE METHODS
[0059]      FIG. 6 is a flowchart illustrating a method 600 for a payment service providers to
provide check-in based payments, according to an example embodiment. In an example, the
method 600 can include operations for receiving authorization to connect a check-in account
with a payment account at 605, receiving check-in data from the check-in service at 610, pre
approving payment for a deal at 615, optionally sending notification to merchant regarding pre
approval at 620, optionally receiving payment details from merchant at 625, sending a user a
one-time use authorization PIN (e.g., code) at 630, receiving validated transaction information
from the merchant at 635, and optionally sending a receipt to the user detailing the transaction at
640.
[0060]      In an example, the method 600 can begin at 605 with the payment modules 422
receiving authorization from a merchant to connect the merchant's payment account on the
network-based payment service 140 with the merchant's check-in service account on the
network-based check-in service 120. In an example, the merchant authorization can include the
check-in module 505 setting up the authorized connection. In certain examples, the payment
modules 422 can also receive authorization from a user to connect a user's payment account with
the user's check-in account (this operation is not explicitly shown in FIG. 6).
[0061]      At 610, the method 600 can continue with the check-in service module 505 receiving
check-in data from the check-in service. In an example, the check-in data can include deals setup
for the merchant on the network-based check-in service 120. At 615, the method 600 can
continue with the payment modules 422 receiving pre-approval from a user for payment. In an
example, the pre-approval can originate from a check-in service, such as the network-based
check-in service 120, and is processed by the check-in service module 505. In an example, the
pre-approval is specific to a particular deal offered by the merchant over the network-based
check-in service 120. In these examples, the pre-approval is generated when the user checks in at
one of the merchant's retail locations. Further, the pre-approval can expire within a pre-define
timeframe if a related transaction is not completed (as discussed below). In an example, the
expiration time for pre-approval can be specified by the user (e.g., set within payment service
settings or check-in service settings). The pre-approval can also expire if the check-in service
receives notification that the mobile device is no longer within the check-in location (e.g., via a
                                               12

WO 2013/115853                                                                 PCT/US2012/055195
new check-in at a different location). In certain examples, pre-approval can be generated by the
authentication engine 520 and can include generation of a one-time use PIN. In these examples,
when the check-in module 505 receives check-in data from the check-in service, the
authentication engine 520 can be triggered to generate a pre-approval including a one-time use
PIN for use with the merchant associated with the check-in.
[0062]      At 620, the method 600 can optionally continue with the check-in service module 505
sending a notification to the merchant regarding the payment pre-approval or check-in. In certain
examples, the notification to the merchant can include secondary identification, such as a picture,
that allows the merchant to engage the user within the retail location. In this example, the
notification to the merchant, such as merchant 130, can be processed by the POS system 134. At
625, the method 600 can optionally continue with the settlement module 540 receiving payment
details from the merchant regarding a specific transaction with the user. In an example, the
transaction details concern a purchase transaction involving the pre-approved deal. In this
example, the payment details can be transmitted by the POS system 134.
[0063]      At 630, the method 600 can continue with the authentication engine 520 generating
and sending a one-time use PIN to the user 110 to complete the transaction with the merchant
130. In an example, the authorization engine 520 also sends a secure copy of the PIN to the
merchant's POS, such as POS system 134. In this example, the PIN is not revealed to the
merchant 130, but the POS system 134 is able to locally validate the PIN when the user 110
submits it to the POS system 134. In an example, the user 110 can type the PIN into the POS
system 134, or provide the PIN verbally to the merchant 130 for entry into the POS system 134.
In certain examples, the user's mobile device, such as mobile 115, and the merchant's POS, such
as POS system 134, can exchange the one-time use PIN via some form of wireless networking
(e.g., NFC or IEEE 802.11). In these examples, submitting the PIN to the merchant 130 validates
the user's intent to complete the purchase transaction. In yet other examples, the one-time use
PIN is validated by the merchant, such as merchant 130, via communication with the payment
service, such as payment service 140. PIN validation can be performed in near real-time in a
manner similar to credit card validation via the merchant's POS system, such as POS system
134. In certain examples, operation 630 can be performed as part of operation 615 (e.g., as part
of generating the pre-approval of payment).
[0064]      At 635, the method 600 can continue with the authentication engine 520 receiving
validated transaction information from the merchant 130. In an example, the authentication
engine 520 validates the PIN information provided by the merchant 130 and sends the validated
transaction information on to the settlement module 540 for processing. At 640, the method 600
can conclude with the settlement module 540 sending a receipt to the user 110 detailing the
                                             13

WO 2013/115853                                                                 PCT/US2012/055195
transaction. In certain examples, the settlement module 540 can also send a receipt to the
merchant 130 as well as transfer funds from the user's account to the merchant's account in
accordance with the transaction details.
[0065]      FIG. 7 is a flowchart illustrating a method 700 for a user to make a purchase using
check-in based payment processing, according to an example embodiment. In an example, the
method 700 includes operations for authorizing a payment service to connect to a check-in
service at 705, registering a check-in with the check-in service at 710, optionally receiving an
offer at 715, initiating a transaction at 720, receiving a one-time use PIN at 725, providing the
PIN to a merchant at 730, and receiving a receipt at 735.
[0066]      In an example, the method 700 can begin at 705 with the user 110 authorizing a
payment service to connect the user's payment service account with a check-in service account.
In an example, the user 110 via a mobile device, such as mobile device 115, authorizes the
network-based payment service 140 to connect the user's payment account with a check-in
account on the network-based check-in service 120. In certain examples, the payment service
and check-in service are operated by a single entity, allowing the operation of connecting user
accounts to be an internal event. In other examples, the check-in service, such as network-based
check-in service 120, can leverage application programming interface (API) access to the
network-based payment service 140 to create a new payment account for the user from within
the network-based check-in service 120 interface (e.g., browser interface or mobile application
interface).
[0067]      At 710, the method 700 can continue with the user 110 via mobile device 115
registering a check-in with the network-based check-in service 120. At 715, the method 700 can
continue with the user's mobile device, mobile device 115, receiving an offer from the network
based check-in service 120. At 720, the method 700 continues with the user 110 initiating a
transaction with the merchant 130 at the check-in location. In an example, the transaction is
related to the offer received by the user 110. In certain examples, the user 110 initiates the
transaction via the mobile device 115. In other examples, the user 110 presents the offer on the
mobile device 115 to the merchant 130 to initiate the transaction. In these examples, the POS
system 134 can scan a bar code (QR code or similar scanable code) to initiate the transaction. In
yet further examples, a mobile application on mobile device 115 can communicate with
merchant 130 (e.g., with POS system 134) to present the offer and initiate the transaction.
[0068]      At 725, the method 700 can continue with the user 110 receiving a one-time use PIN
to authorize the transaction. In an example, the one-time use PIN is sent by the network-based
payment system 140 to the mobile device 115. At 730, the method 700 continues with the user
110 providing the PIN to the merchant to authorize the transaction. In an example, the PIN can
                                                14

WO 2013/115853                                                                 PCT/US2012/055195
be presented manually, such as by the user entering it into POS system 134. In another example,
the PIN can be shared via a wireless network between the mobile device 115 and the POS system
134. Finally, at 735, the method 700 can conclude with the user 110 receiving an electronic
receipt for the transaction from the network-based payment system 140. In an example, the user
110 receives the receipt on the mobile device 115.
[0069]      FIG. 8 is a flowchart illustrating a method 800 for a merchant to offer check-in based
payment processing, according to an example embodiment. In an example, the method 800 can
include operations such as: authorizing a payment service to connect to a check-in service
account at 805, optionally creating offers at 810, receiving notification of check-in and payment
pre-approval at 815, initiating a transaction with a user at 820, sending transaction details to a
payment service at 825, receiving a one-time use PIN to authorize a transaction at 830, and
receiving a receipt detailing the transaction at 835.
[0070]      At 805, the method 800 can begin with the merchant 130 authorizing a payment
service, such as the network-based payment service 140, to connect the merchant's payment
account with the merchant's check-in account on a check-in service, such as the network-based
check-in service 120. At 810, the method 800 continues with the merchant 130 generating offers
that can be delivered by the network-based check-in service 120 when a user registers a check-in
at one of the merchant's retail locations.
[0071]      At 815, the method 800 continues with the merchant 130 receiving notification of a
check-in and payment pre-approval. In an example, the check-in notification can be sent by the
network-based check-in service 120 to the merchant's POS system 134. In another example, the
check-in and the payment pre-approval can be sent by the network-based payment service 140 to
the merchant's POS system 134. In certain examples, the merchant 130 can also receive
secondary identification information, such as a picture of the user, at the POS system 134. In
these examples, the secondary identification information can be used by the merchant 130 to
engage the targeted user.
[0072]      At 820, the method 800 continues with the merchant 130 initiating a transaction with
the user. In an example, the user initiates the transaction by presenting an offer code to the
merchant's POS system 134. In other examples, the user can initiate a transaction simply by
placing an order or selecting an item for purchase. In certain examples, the merchant 130 can
provide a mobile shopping application that the user, such as user 110, runs on a mobile device,
such as mobile device 115. In these examples, the user 110 can initiate a transaction by selecting
a product or service on the mobile device 115. At 825, the method 800 continues with the
merchant's POS system 134 sending transaction details to the network-based payment service
140. In certain examples, the network-based payment service 140 sends, in response to the
                                               15

WO 2013/115853                                                                PCT/US2012/055195
transaction details, information to allow the POS system 134 to locally validate the transaction
(e.g., one-time use PIN information). At 830, the method 800 continues with the merchant's
POS system 134 receiving the one-time use PIN from the user to authorize the transaction. In an
example, the POS system 134 sends the one-time use PIN to the network-based payment system
140 for validation. In another example, the POS system 134 has sufficient information, provided
earlier by the network-based payment service 140, to validate the PIN locally. At 835, the
method 800 can conclude with the merchant's POS system 134 receiving a transaction settlement
receipt from the network-based payment system 140.
[0073]       Each of FIGs. 6 through 8 illustrates methods for check-in based payment processing,
according to various examples. While each method is illustrated as including certain operations
in a certain order, these operations and the order of operations are merely exemplary and should
not be considered as limiting the subject matter. Other example methods can include fewer or
additional operations or similar operations in a different order.
MODULES, COMPONENTS AND LOGIC
[0074]       Certain embodiments are described herein as including logic or a number of
components, modules, or mechanisms. Modules may constitute either software modules (e.g.,
code embodied on a machine-readable medium or in a transmission signal) or hardware modules.
A hardware module is a tangible unit capable of performing certain operations and may be
configured or arranged in a certain manner. In example embodiments, one or more computer
systems (e.g., a standalone, client or server computer system) or one or more hardware modules
of a computer system (e.g., a processor or a group of processors) may be configured by software
(e.g., an application or application portion) as a hardware module that operates to perform certain
operations as described herein.
[0075]       In various embodiments, a hardware module may be implemented mechanically or
electronically. For example, a hardware module may comprise dedicated circuitry or logic that is
permanently configured (e.g., as a special-purpose processor, such as a field programmable gate
array (FPGA) or an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC)) to perform certain operations.
A hardware module may also comprise programmable logic or circuitry (e.g., as encompassed
within a general-purpose processor or other programmable processor) that is temporarily
configured by software to perform certain operations. It will be appreciated that the decision to
implement a hardware module mechanically, in dedicated and permanently configured circuitry,
or in temporarily configured circuitry (e.g., configured by software) may be driven by cost and
time considerations.
[0076]       Accordingly, the term "hardware module" should be understood to encompass a
                                              16

WO 2013/115853                                                                 PCT/US2012/055195
tangible entity, be that an entity that is physically constructed, permanently configured (e.g.,
hardwired) or temporarily configured (e.g., programmed) to operate in a certain manner and/or to
perform certain operations described herein. Considering embodiments in which hardware
modules are temporarily configured (e.g., programmed), each of the hardware modules need not
be configured or instantiated at any one instance in time. For example, where the hardware
modules comprise a general-purpose processor configured using software, the general-purpose
processor may be configured as respective different hardware modules at different times.
Software may accordingly configure a processor, for example, to constitute a particular hardware
module at one instance of time and to constitute a different hardware module at a different
instance of time.
[0077]       Hardware modules can provide information to, and receive information from, other
hardware modules. Accordingly, the described hardware modules may be regarded as being
communicatively coupled. Where multiple of such hardware modules exist contemporaneously,
communications may be achieved through signal transmission (e.g., over appropriate circuits and
buses) that connect the hardware modules. In embodiments in which multiple hardware modules
are configured or instantiated at different times, communications between such hardware
modules may be achieved, for example, through the storage and retrieval of information in
memory structures to which the multiple hardware modules have access. For example, one
hardware module may perform an operation and store the output of that operation in a memory
device to which it is communicatively coupled. A further hardware module may then, at a later
time, access the memory device to retrieve and process the stored output. Hardware modules
may also initiate communications with input or output devices, and can operate on a resource
(e.g., a collection of information).
[0078]       The various operations of example methods described herein may be performed, at
least partially, by one or more processors that are temporarily configured (e.g., by software) or
permanently configured to perform the relevant operations. Whether temporarily or permanently
configured, such processors may constitute processor-implemented modules that operate to
perform one or more operations or functions. The modules referred to herein may, in some
example embodiments, comprise processor-implemented modules.
[0079]       Similarly, the methods described herein may be at least partially processor
implemented. For example, at least some of the operations of a method may be performed by
one or processors or processor-implemented modules. The performance of certain of the
operations may be distributed among the one or more processors, not only residing within a
single machine, but deployed across a number of machines. In some example embodiments, the
processor or processors may be located in a single location (e.g., within a home environment, an
                                               17

WO 2013/115853                                                                 PCT/US2012/055195
office environment or as a server farm), while in other embodiments the processors may be
distributed across a number of locations.
[0080]      The one or more processors may also operate to support performance of the relevant
operations in a "cloud computing" environment or as a "software as a service" (SaaS). For
example, at least some of the operations may be performed by a group of computers (as
examples of machines including processors), with these operations being accessible via a
network (e.g., the Internet) and via one or more appropriate interfaces (e.g., APIs).
ELECTRONIC APPARATUS AND SYSTEM
[0081]        Example embodiments may be implemented in digital electronic circuitry, or in
computer hardware, firmware, software, or in combinations of them. Example embodiments
may be implemented using a computer program product, for example, a computer program
tangibly embodied in an information carrier, for example, in a machine-readable medium for
execution by, or to control the operation of, data processing apparatus, for example, a
programmable processor, a computer, or multiple computers.
[0082]      A computer program can be written in any form of programming language, including
compiled or interpreted languages, and it can be deployed in any form, including as a stand-alone
program or as a module, subroutine, or other unit suitable for use in a computing environment.
A computer program can be deployed to be executed on one computer or on multiple computers
at one site or distributed across multiple sites and interconnected by a communication network.
[0083]      In example embodiments, operations may be performed by one or more
programmable processors executing a computer program to perform functions by operating on
input data and generating output. Method operations can also be performed by, and apparatus of
example embodiments may be implemented as, special purpose logic circuitry (e.g., a FPGA or
an ASIC).
[0084]      The computing system can include clients and servers. A client and server are
generally remote from each other and typically interact through a communication network. The
relationship of client and server arises by virtue of computer programs running on the respective
computers and having a client-server relationship to each other. In embodiments deploying a
programmable computing system, it will be appreciated that both hardware and software
architectures require consideration. Specifically, it will be appreciated that the choice of whether
to implement certain functionality in permanently configured hardware (e.g., an ASIC), in
temporarily configured hardware (e.g., a combination of software and a programmable
processor), or a combination of permanently and temporarily configured hardware may be a
design choice. Below are set out hardware (e.g., machine) and software architectures that may

EXAMPLE MACHINE ARCHITECTURE AND MACHINE-READABLE MEDIUM
[0085]        FIG. 9 is a block diagram of machine in the example form of a computer system
900 within which instructions, for causing the machine to perform any one or more of the
methodologies discussed herein, may be executed. In alternative embodiments, the machine
operates as a standalone device or may be connected (e.g., networked) to other machines. In a
networked deployment, the machine may operate in the capacity of a server or a client machine
in server-client network environment, or as a peer machine in a peer-to-peer (or distributed)
network environment. The machine may be a personal computer (PC), a tablet PC, a set-top box
(STB), a PDA, a cellular telephone, a web appliance, a network router, switch or bridge, or any
machine capable of executing instructions (sequential or otherwise) that specify actions to be
taken by that machine. Further, while only a single machine is illustrated, the term "machine"
shall also be taken to include any collection of machines that individually or jointly execute a set
(or multiple sets) of instructions to perform any one or more of the methodologies discussed
herein.
[00861        The example computer system 900 includes a processor 902 (e.g., a central
processing unit (CPU), a graphics processing unit (GPU) or both), a main memory 904 and a
static memory 906, which communicate with each other via a bus 908. The computer system
900 may further include a video display unit 910 (e.g., a liquid crystal display (LCD) or a
cathode ray tube (CRT)). The computer system 900 also includes an alphanumeric input device
912 (e.g., a keyboard), a user interface (UI) navigation device 914 (e.g., a mouse), a disk drive
unit 916, a signal generation device 918 (e.g., a speaker) and a network interface device 920.
MACHINE-READABLE MEDIUM
[0087]      The disk drive unit 916 includes a machine-readable medium 922 on which is stored
one or more sets of instructions and data structures (e.g., software) 924 embodying or used by
any one or more of the methodologies or functions described herein. The instructions 924 may
also reside, completely or at least partially, within the main memory 904, static memory 906,
and/or within the processor 902 during execution thereof by the computer system 900, the main
memory 904 and the processor 902 also constituting machine-readable media.
[0088]      While the machine-readable medium 922 is shown in an example embodiment to be a
single medium, the term "machine-readable medium" may include a single medium or multiple
media (e.g., a centralized or distributed database, and/or associated caches and servers) that store
the one or more instructions or data structures. The term "machine-readable medium" shall also
                                               19

WO 2013/115853                                                                 PCT/US2012/055195
be taken to include any tangible medium that is capable of storing, encoding or carrying
instructions for execution by the machine and that cause the machine to perform any one or more
of the methodologies of the present invention, or that is capable of storing, encoding or carrying
data structures used by or associated with such instructions. The term "machine-readable
medium" shall accordingly be taken to include, but not be limited to, solid-state memories, and
optical and magnetic media. Specific examples of machine-readable media include non-volatile
memory, including by way of example, semiconductor memory devices (e.g., Erasable
Programmable Read-Only Memory (EPROM), Electrically Erasable Programmable Read-Only
Memory (EEPROM)) and flash memory devices; magnetic disks such as internal hard disks and
removable disks; magneto-optical disks; and CD-ROM and DVD-ROM disks.
TRANSMISSION MEDIUM
[0089]       The instructions 924 may further be transmitted or received over a communications
network 926 using a transmission medium. The instructions 924 may be transmitted using the
network interface device 920 and any one of a number of well-known transfer protocols (e.g.,
HTTP). Examples of communication networks include a LAN, a WAN, the Internet, mobile
telephone networks, Plain Old Telephone (POTS) networks, and wireless data networks (e.g.,
WiFi and WiMax networks). The term "transmission medium" shall be taken to include any
intangible medium that is capable of storing, encoding or carrying instructions for execution by
the machine, and includes digital or analog communications signals or other intangible media to
facilitate communication of such software.
