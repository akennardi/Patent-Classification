                                             Abstract
        A gaming machine and associated method. Symbols are selected and presented on a
display in a first random selection process. Each symbol is selected independently of each other
symbol and the plurality of symbols are separated into at least three distinct groups of symbols,
each group containing at least two symbols. A player of the gaming machine selects one or
more of the groups of symbols to be held. In a second random selection process any symbols
that are not held are reselected. A prize is paid according to a pay table and the symbols
presented following the second random selection process.
                                                                      10086003 1 (GHMatters) P88024AU.3 22/03/18

   Field of the Invention
            The present invention generally relates to gaming machines and methods of
 5 gaming. A particular embodiment of the present invention relates to gaming machines
   that select and present a plurality of game outcomes on which the player may stake a
   wager.
   Background of the Invention
10          With the increase of gambling at gaming venues has come increased
   competition between gaming venues to obtain a larger share of the total gambling
   spend. Gaming venue operators have therefore continuously looked for new variations
   and types of games in order to attract both new and return customers to their venues.
15          In response to this need, suppliers of gaming devices and systems have
   attempted to provide the sought after variety, while still developing games that comply
   with the relevant regulations in the jurisdiction of the gaming venue operator. Suppliers
   therefore are faced with restrictions on the types of games and gaming machines that
   are allowable, both in terms of the prevailing regulations and in terms of providing a
20 return on investment to the gaming venue operators.
            One way in which suppliers have provided increased variety and interest is to
   provide multi-line spinning reel gaming machines and other games with a plurality of
   outcomes, such as poker-style card games with multiple hands. The increased number
25 of game outcomes that result (one outcome per pay line in a spinning reel game and
   one outcome per hand in a card game), provides for increased wager options. For
   example, the player may select to wager on one pay line or hand, or may select to
   wager on a plurality of pay lines or hands. In addition, the player may select to wager a
   variable amount on each outcome. For example, in a spinning reel game, in one game
30 play the player may wager 1 credit per pay line selected and in another game play may
   wager 10 credits per pay line selected.
            In addition to the demand for new games, there continues to be a demand for
   traditional types of games. For example, gaming machines with mechanical reels
35 driven by stepper motors continue to be popular with many players. There is therefore
   also a demand for gaming machines that may be of interest to these players.
                                                                  100860031 (GHMatters) P88024 AU.3 22/03118

                                             - 2
           With regards to gaming machines players often look to games where they have
   a degree of input and control over the outcome. Games such as video Poker give
   players a chance to select, from an initial display of typically five playing cards, which
   cards to hold and which to discard in the hopes of improving the hand ranking (and
 5 award) on the draw where discarded cards are replaced.
           Still a further aspect of gaming is the desire of players to be able to increase
   their odds for receiving a winning outcome. This can be done by providing, more wager
   options as described above such as providing players with the ability to wager on
10 multiple pay lines or arrangements. Providing more wagering propositions increases
   the odds for a player to receive a winning outcome and, for the casino, increases the
   amounts wagered and hence their expected profits.

    which is displayed representations of a game that can be played by a player and a
    bank of buttons 107A and/or a touch screen 107B to enable a player to play the game.
                                                                 100860031 (GHMatters) P88024 AU.3 22/03118

                                             -   6
    The displays 106 may be video display units, such as a cathode ray tube screen
    device, a liquid crystal display, plasma screen, any other suitable video display unit, or
    the visible portion of an electromechanical device. In one particular embodiment of the
    invention, the display 106A is an array of physical spinning reels, which are rotated by
  5 stepper motors. The display 106B may display artwork, including for example, pay
    tables and details of bonus awards and other information or images relating to the
    game. In alternative gaming consoles the display 106B may be omitted, optionally
    replaced by a static display. Where a single game is played, as hereinafter described,
    only display 106A need be a processor controlled display such as an LCD, plasma,
10  OLED or other video display. Where multiple games are played display 106A may be
    configured to handle the display of the games or additionally or alternatively the top
    display 106B may be a processor controlled video display displaying one or more
    games to the player.
15           A credit input including a coin input 11OA and/or bill collector 11OB allows a
    player to provide credit for wagering and a coin output 111 is provided for cash payouts
    from the gaming console 114. A card and/or ticket reader 108 and a printer 109 may
    be provided to provide player tracking, cashless game play or other gaming and non
    gaming related functions.
20
             Figure 2 shows a block diagram of a gaming machine, generally referenced by
    arrow 100, suitable for implementing the present invention. The gaming machine 100
    may include the gaming console 114 shown in Figure 1 and accordingly like reference
    numerals have been used to describe like components in Figures 1 and 2.
25
             The gaming machine 100 includes a game controller 101, which in the
    illustrated  example    includes   a  computational  device    102, which            may      be      a
    microprocessor, microcontroller, programmable logic device or other suitable device.
    Instructions and data to control operation of the computational device 102 are stored in
30  a memory       103, which is in data communication with,          or forms         part of, the
    computational device 102. Typically, the gaming machine 100 will include both volatile
    and non-volatile memory and more than one of each type of memory, with such
    memories being collectively represented by the memory 103. The instructions to cause
    the game controller 101 to implement the present invention will be stored in the
35  memory 103. The instructions and data for controlling operation of the computational
    device 102 may be stored on a computer readable medium from which they are loaded
    into the gaming machine memory 103, The instructions and data may be conveyed to
                                                                  100860031 (GHMatters) P88024 AU.3 22/03118

                                             - 7
   the gaming machine by means of a data signal in a transmission channel. Examples of
   such transmission channels include network connections, the Internet or an intranet
   and wireless communication channels.
 5         The game controller 101 may include hardware credit meters 104 for the
   purposes of regulatory compliance and also include an input/output (1/O) interface 105
   for communicating with the peripheral devices of the gaming machine 100. The
   input/output interface 105 and/or the peripheral devices may be intelligent devices with
   their own memory for instructions and data.
10
           In the example shown in Figure 2, the peripheral devices that communicate
   with the controller are the displays 106, bank of buttons/touch screen 107, the card
   and/or ticket reader 108, the printer 109, a bill acceptor and/or coin input 110 and a
   coin output 111. Additional devices may be included as part of the gaming machine
15 100, or devices omitted as required for the specific implementation.
           The bank of buttons 107A and/or touch screen 107B together with one or both
   of the displays 106 may provide a user interface 115 through which the gaming
   machine 100 and player communicate. If a card/ticket reader 108 is provided, this may
20 also form part of the user interface 115.
           In addition, the gaming machine 100 may include a communications interface,
   for example a network card 112. The network card 112, may for example, send status
   information, accounting information or other information to a central controller, server
25 or database and receive data or commands from the central controller, server or
   database. The network card 112 may also enable communication with a central player
   account, allowing cashless gaming. One or more of the peripheral devices, for example
   the card/ticket reader 108 may be able to communicate directly with the network card
   112. The network card 112 and the I/O interface 105 may be suitably implemented as
30 a single machine communications interface.
           The game controller 101 may also include a random number generator (RNG)
   113, which generates a series of random numbers that are used by the computational
   device 102 to determine the outcomes of games played on the gaming machine 100.
35 In particular, the RNG 113 determines the displayed stopping position of each of the
   reels 1 (see Figure 4). Reels 1 may be either electro-mechanical stepper reels or video
   generated representations of reels.
                                                                100860031 (GHMatters) P88024 AU.3 22/03118

                                            -  8
           The game controller 101        may have distributed hardware and software
   components that communicate with each other directly or through a network or other
   communication channel. The game controller 101 may also be located in part or in its
 5 entirety remote from the user interface 115. Also, the computational device 102 may
   comprise a plurality of devices, which may be local or remote from each other and may
   incorporate jackpot servers and other devices that determine game play of games on
   the gaming console 114. Instructions and data for controlling the operation of the user
   interface 115 may be conveyed to the user interface 115 by means of a data signal in a
10 transmission channel. The user interface 115 may be a computational device, for
   example a personal computer, used by a person to play a game provided from a
   remote game controller 101.
           Figure 3 shows an exemplary block diagram of the main components of the
15 memory 103. The RAM 103A typically temporarily holds instructions and data related
   to the execution of game programs and communication functions performed by the
   computational controller 102. The EPROM 103B may be a boot ROM device and/or
   may contain system and game related code. The mass storage device 103C may be
   used to store game programs, the integrity of which may be verified and/or
20 authenticated by the computational controller 102 using protected code from the
   EPROM 103B or elsewhere.
           Figure 4 shows a screen display that may be displayed on the display 106A
   that includes a touch screen 107B. The screen display in this embodiment shows a
25 game that displays on the display 106A fifteen reels 1 (one only indicated by a
   reference numeral), each of which presents a symbol 2 (one only indicated). In the
   embodiment shown, the reels 1 are arranged in an array in the form of a matrix having
   three rows and five columns 3-7. Below the columns 3-7 is displayed 'Hold' icons 8-12,
   which represent the location of touch panels on the touch screen 107B.
30
           Each of the fifteen reels 1 has a plurality of symbols on it and in this
   embodiment displays a single symbol when stopped. The number of symbols on each
   of the reels 1 is a matter of design choice. For example, each reel may have between
   15 to 25 symbols, with either all reels having the same number of symbols or different
35 reels having differing numbers of symbols, depending on the specific implementation.
   The symbols sets on the reels 1 may all be the same or may differ between the reels.
                                                                100860031 (GHMatters) P88024 AU.3 22/03118

                                              -  9
            When the game is played, the stopping position of each of the reels 1 is
   individually randomly determined. Accordingly the symbols 2 displayed by each reel 1
   is randomly determined independently of the stopping position of the other reels 1. By
   way of example only, the reels may display the symbols as shown in Figure 4.
 5
            The player then selects between zero and all of the columns 3-7 to 'Hold'.
   Equivalently, the player may select between zero and all of the columns 3-7 to reselect
   or discard.
10          For example, the pay table of the game may specify that three, four or five 'J'
   symbols along a pay line pay prizes. If the symbols shown in Figure 4 are displayed in
   the initial display or "deal", the player may choose to hold columns 3, 4, 5 and 7, both
   to preserve the winning combination of three 'J' symbols and in the hope that the reel
   on the third row of column 6, when re-spun, will reveal a 'J' symbol to provide five 'J'
15 symbols along the pay line P3 (see Figure 5). Assuming that this choice is made, then
   all three reels 1 in column 6 are re-spun on the "draw", which may result in the screen
   display shown in Figure 5. This screen display indicates whether a win has occurred.
            In this embodiment, the game has three pay line P1-P3 that extend across
20 each of the three rows of reels 1. If the rules of the game require combinations of
   symbols to occur from left to right along a pay line, and three or more 'J', 'Q', 'K' or 'A'
   symbols along a pay line to win a prize, then the result of the game play indicated by
   Figure 5 is the awarding of the prize specified in the pay table for three 'J' symbols.
25          The two-stage selection process of the initial deal and the draw therefore
   provides a plurality of initial outcomes (the symbols shown in Figure 4 along the pay
   lines P1-P3) and a plurality of final outcomes as a result of the draw (the symbols
   shown in Figure 5 along the pay lines P1-P3). In some embodiments, the player may
   be given two or more opportunities to hold or reselect symbols, meaning that there
30 would be one or more intermediate outcomes and a three or more stage selection
   process. Of course, the more opportunities to reselect symbols, the higher the chance
   of the total game play resulting in a winning outcome in one or more of the outcomes
   and therefore the wager required and/or the prizes payable will need to reflect this to
   achieve a required expected return to player for the gaming machine 100.
35
            As is apparent from Figures 4 and 5, conflicting hold strategies may result. For

                                                                  100860031 (GHMatters) P88024 AU.3 22/03118

                                              -   10
   choose to hold the reels in columns 3, 4 and 7, in the hope of achieving three, four or
   five 'K' symbols along pay line P1. Which option is preferred depends on the chance of
   achieving each of these winning outcomes and the size of the prize associated with
   each outcome, as specified by the pay table for the gaming machine 100. By way of
 5  simplified example, if every symbol had a 1 in 5 chance of occurring on a reel 1, then if
    reels 3-5 and 7 were held, there would be an 80% chance of achieving a win for three
   'J' symbols and a 20% chance of achieving a win for five 'J' symbols. If instead reels 3,
   4 and 7 were held, there would be a 16% chance of achieving a win for three 'K'
   symbols, a 4% chance of winning the prize for five 'K' symbols, a 16% chance for
10 winning the prize for three 'J' symbols and a 4% chance of winning the prize for five 'J'
   symbols.
             If the prizes had values as follows:
                      Three 'J' symbols pays 5 credits;
15                    Five 'J' symbols pays 25 credits;
                      Three 'K' symbols pays 20 credits; and
                      Five 'K' symbols pays 50 credits;
   then the expected return for holding reels 8-10 and 12 is 9 credits and the expected
   average return for holding reels 8-9 and 12 would be 7 credits. Therefore, statistically
20 the better strategy is to hold reels 3-5 and 7. However if the prize for five 'K' symbols
    paid 250 credits, then the expected average return for holding reels 3-4 and 7 would
    increase to 15, making the better strategy the holding of reels 3-4. The game could
   therefore involve a skill element, requiring the player to choose the correct hold
   strategy, or the gaming machine could recommend or require the best hold strategy for
25 the player.
             Prizes other than prizes in credits may be offered. For example, a prize may be
   an award of a feature game or the award of a physical item, such as a car. Each of
   these prizes will have a value or expected average value that can be used to
30 determine the expected overall return of the game and the expected return of each
    hold strategy in a game.
             In the screen shot shown in Figure 5, the Hold icons 8-12 are not displayed, as
   the player no longer has the option to hold some symbols and reselect others.
35 Alternatively, the Hold icons 8-12 may still be displayed. When still displayed, the icons
   8-12 may be lit brightly when they can be selected to hold symbols in their respective
                                                                   100860031 (GHMatters) P88024 AU.3 22/03118

   column 3-7 and dulled when the final outcome is displayed. When selected the icons 8
   12 may be dulled, or may flash or otherwise represent that they have been selected.
           While the description of Figures 4 and 5 has been provided with reference to an
 5 electronic gaming machine where a video display displays representations of reels,
   cards or other symbol carrying devices, in one embodiment the symbols are carried on
   physical reels. In this case, the Hold icons 8-12 are replaced by Hold buttons, which
   may be part of the bank of buttons 107A, or provided separate to the bank of buttons
   107A, for example immediately below the physical reels to in a similar configuration to
10 that shown in Figures 1, 4 and 5. The Hold buttons may be illuminated to show when
   they can be used to hold symbols.
           Figure 6 shows a process flow diagram of a process performed in accordance
   with an embodiment of the present invention. The process may be performed by any of
15 the versions of the gaming machine 100 described previously herein.
           In step 20, the game controller 101 monitors the bill acceptor and/or coin input
   110 and/or information received by the card/ticket reader 108 or network card 112 for a
   deposit of credit and in response causes the hardware meters 104 to increment
20 according to the denomination of the game. The game controller 101 then monitors the
   user interface 107 for the input of a wager. The input of the wager may specify whether
   the player wishes to wager on pay line P2 alone, on pay lines P1 and P2, or on all
   three pay lines P1-P3. The input may also specify the amount to be wagered on each
   pay line. In alternative embodiments, the number of pay lines may be fixed at three
25 and/or the amount to be wagered per pay line may be fixed.
           If there is sufficient credits in the meters 104 to support the wager, a game play
   is commenced in step 21 by the game controller 101 receiving random numbers from
   the RNG 113, spinning the reels 1 and causing the reels 1 to stop according to the
30 received random numbers. As previously described, the stopping position of each reel
   is independently determined.
           In step 22 the game controller monitors the bank of buttons and/or touch screen
   107 for a player input of reels to be held. The player may select columns of reels to
35 hold by touching the touch screen 107B at the location of between zero and all five of
   the 'Hold' icons 8-12. Repeated presses of the same 'Hold' icon may cycle between
   selecting and deselecting a column to be held. As discussed previously, the gaming
                                                                   100860031 (GHMatters) P88024 AU.3 22/03118

                                            -  12
   machine may indicate a recommended hold strategy, for example by illuminating the
   appropriate columns and/or the appropriate 'Hold' icons and may require selection of
   the recommended hold strategy. This may be achieved by preventing continued play
   until the appropriate columns have been held.
 5
            The player may indicate completion of the selection of a hold strategy by
   pressing a 'spin' or 'draw' button (step 23). This may be a button in the bank of buttons
   107A. The game controller 101 then determines if any symbols have not been held. If
   all five columns have been held, then the process proceeds to step 26.
10
            If there are reels that have not been held, then these reels are re-spun and
   stopped to reveal the game outcome (step 25). In step 26 any prizes are awarded to
   the win meter. These prizes may be transferred to the credit meter automatically, or
   after the completion of further optional game processes, such as a double or nothing
15 gamble feature.
            The embodiment described above had a total of fifteen reels, each presenting
   one symbol. In other embodiments other numbers of reels may be provided. For
   example, an alternative embodiment may involve a game having three columns and
20 two rows so as to present six symbols. Another embodiment may have three columns
   and three rows of reels. A still further embodiment may have six columns and four
   rows.
            In addition, the reels need not be presented in a matrix. All that is required is
   the presentation of a plurality of symbols in three or more groups, to allow a hold
25 strategy to be determined and selected. In certain embodiments of the invention,
   including the embodiments described herein previously, each group of symbols may
   include one and only one symbol from each outcome that indicates whether a winning
   outcome has occurred (i.e. each group includes only one symbol from each pay line
   P1-P3). Alternatively, larger groups may be provided. For example, a player may be
30 required to select either both of columns 3 and 4 to be held or select none of the
   symbols in these two columns to be held. The option could still be provided to select
   columns 5-7 individually, or these columns may be split into a group of two columns
   and a single column.
35          In another embodiment, and with reference to Figures 7 and 8, the display
   106A displays a primary game display with three vertically arranged reels 200, 202,
   204 each displaying three symbols in rows 208, 210, 212. Each reel 200-204 may be
                                                                 100860031 (GHMatters) P88024 AU.3 22/03118

                                             -  13
    an electro-mechanical stepper reel or may be a reel displayed on a video display as is
    known in the art. Each reel 200-204 defines a set of symbols such as symbols S1-SN
    as is known in the art. There may be, for example, twenty-two stops for each reel with
    each stop defining a position for a symbol (including graphic symbols such as "7s",
  5 "Bar", "Cherry" or blanks or a partial symbol where there may be more stops than
    symbols. Under control of the processor 102 the reels 200-204 are controlled spin and
    stop to randomly position symbols in the 3 x 3 game matrix 214 defined by the three
    reels 200-204 and the three rows 208-212 to define, at least initially, a primary game
    initial display.
10
              In addition to the primary game display at display 106A the player can enable
    one or more second games 216a-d which are also, in this example, 3x3 display
    matrices. These second games 216a-d can be displayed at display 106B or, in the
    alternative, may share real estate with the primary game display at the display 106a.
15
              The primary game display 106A has one or more pay lines. While there may be
    numerous pay lines, for purposes of explanation it will be assumed that the primary
    game as well as the second games have only three horizontal pay lines 218, 220, 222.
    It should be understood that there may be more or fewer pay lines.
20
              To play the game of Figures 7 and 8, the player makes a wager to enable one
    or more pay lines for the primary game and for one or more second games 216a-d. A
    wager protocol is preferably adopted such that the player's wagers first enable the pay
    lines of the primary game before enabling pay lines in any second game 216a-d.
25  Alternatively, through a touch screen input, the player may be able to allocate some of
    the wagers. For purposes of this example it will be assumed the player has wagered
    the maximum amount to enable the primary and the four second games 216a-d.
              When the player has made their wager, game play is prompted and the
30  processor 102 and RNG 113 randomly select and display at the display 106A a
    primary game initial display or "deal". The player then has the option to hold none, one
    or more reels 200-204 in the hopes of improving the outcome in relation to a
    predetermined pay table. In the example of Figure 7 the player has elected to hold
    reels 200 and 204 and re-spin reel 202 in the hopes, for example, of receiving three S1
35  symbols on pay line 218. The held reels 200 and 204 are replicated into each enabled
    second game as shown. The player then commands a "draw" whereupon the
    processor 102 and RND 113 random select a stop position for and display for each of
                                                                  100860031 (GHMatters) P88024 AU.3 22/03118

                                               -  14
   the primary game and second games 216a-d for the center reels 202. Figure 8 shows
   the displays after the draw. As can be seen in Figure 8, for each of the primary and
   second games 216a-d the stop positions for each of the primary and secondary games
   middle row on the draw each randomly positioned producing in most cases different
 5 winning or losing outcome. With reference to Figure 8 the primary game has a winning
   outcome on payline 218 of three S1 symbols on payline 218. Winning outcomes also
   appear in second games 216b and 216c of also three S1 symbols on the center
   payline. The payer would receive an award for each winning outcome. For the next
   "hand" the player would wager to enable the paylines and second games as discussed
10 above.
             Turning to Figure 9 still a further embodiment of the present invention is shown.
   In this embodiment a primary game 300 is shown defined by a game matrix having
   three reels 200, 202, 204 and rows 208, 210, 212. The leftmost reel 200 may be
15 configured to display a single symbol as shown or "stacked" versions of the same
   symbol such that reel 200 always displays a single symbol. Since most pays are from
   left to right by providing a single symbol (or stacked copies of the same symbol) at reel
   200 confusion over symbol combinations and which reels to hold is diminished. The
   game of Figure 9 may be a payline game as described above or may be a pay
20 arrangement game such as that described in US Patent 6,093,102 owned by the
   assignee of this application, such games sold under the mark REEL POWER@, the
   disclose of which is incorporated by reference. In such games the player wagers on
   reels and symbol arrangements. For example, with reference to the primary game 300
   a first wager would enable the leftmost reel 200 and the center row for reels 202 and
25 204 defining a single pay arrangement. A player may, for example, be able to wager
   five credits on the first arrangement. Wagering more would enable not only the first
   arrangement but a second arrangement including all of the symbols of the second reel
   202 and the center row of reel 204 now defining three symbol arrangements. Again the
   player may be able to wager more on the second arrangement up to a maximum
30 permitted by the game. Wager still more the player would enable all reels defining nine
   symbol arrangements. The available symbol arrangements are defined by the
   equation: N1 M x N2 M x N3M where N1 is the leftmost reel 200, N2 is the center reel 202
   and N3 is reel 204 and "M" is the number of rows of different symbols displayed for the
   reel for the game. Thus for the primary game there are 1 x 3 x 3 possible
35 arrangements for the player to wager upon. To simplify wagering a protocol may be
   adopted for player wagering. For example the first five credits wagered would be
   applied to the first pay arrangement with the sixth-tenth credits wagered adding the
                                                                    100860031 (GHMatters) P88024 AU.3 22/03118

                                             -   15
   second arrangement and so forth. Thus the player could wager a maximum of forty-five
   credits for the primary game.
            In addition to the primary game one or more secondary games 302a, b games
 5 are provided in the display 106B or share real estate with the primary game at display
   106A. The player may enable the one or more secondary games 302a, b by selecting
   and/or wagering. For example, the credits may be wagered and allocated as follows:

           And so forth. According to this example the player could wager a maximum
   amount for the primary and two second games 302a, b of 9 arrangements x 5 credits
   per arrangement x 3 games = 135 credits. Other wagering schemes may be adopted.
15         The pay arrangements of Table 1 are:
            1 St      2 nd-I      ~3 rdM
           After the player has made their wager game play is prompted and the
20 processor 102 and RNG 113 randomly select and display at the display 106A a
   primary game initial display or "deal". According to this embodiment the reel 200 is
   automatically "held". Accordingly reel 200 should have a symbol set such that no initial
   deal is a "dead hand", i.e. cannot possibly result in a winning outcome. The automatic
                                                                  10086003_1 (GHMatters) P88024.AU.3 22/03/18

   holding of reel 200 simplifies the player's decisions and is believed to help speed play.
   It should be understood that the game may randomly select which reel(s) 200, 202,
   204 to hold or, where all reels are similarly populated with symbols the processor may
   select the reel(s) to hold for the best possible outcome for the player. Held reel 200 is
 5 duplicated into any enabled second games 302a, b. The player next has the option of
   additionally holding one or both of reels 202, 204 in the hopes of obtaining a winning
   outcome. In the example of Figure 7 the player would hold reel 204 (assuming the
   player has enabled the third pay arrangement, i.e. all possible none ways of winning)
   hoping to get one or more combinations of S1 symbols for a winning outcome. The
10 held reels 202, 204 are replicated into each of the enabled second games 302a, b.
            The player then prompts a "draw" whereupon the processor randomly selects
   and displays the symbols for reel 202 for the primary and any second games 302a, b
   to complete play and produce an outcome for each game. Each outcome is then
15 compared to a schedule of winning outcomes and the player receives an award for all
   winning outcomes. For example, with reference to Figure 10 and assuming three S1
   symbols are a winning outcome the player has obtained two winning outcomes in the
   primary game 300 and one winning outcome in the second game 302a.
20          The foregoing game can be played on any suitable game matrix of N reels and
   M rows and can be played as an arrangement game such as that described above and
   with reference to the '102 Patent cited above or can be based upon paylines. The
   game can also be played with either electro-mechanical stepper reels or video reels.
25          While the foregoing description has primarily focussed on a spinning reel game,
   the invention may be implemented in other forms, such as a card game where cards
   are selected and displayed on the display 106A, or a dice game.
            While the foregoing description has been provided by way of example of the
30 preferred embodiments of the present invention as presently contemplated, which
   utilise gaming machines of the type found in casinos, those skilled in the relevant arts
   will appreciate that the present invention also may have application to internet gaming
   and/or have application to gaming over a telecommunications network, where
   handsets are used to display game outcomes and receive player inputs.
