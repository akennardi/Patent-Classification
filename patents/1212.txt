25 Description of an Embodiment of the  Invention
   The present gaming system operates such that during play
   of a base game,  a plurality of symbols are randomly
   selected from a set  of symbols and displayed in           a
30 corresponding plurality of display position groups, each
   of which  comprises a plurality of display positions. The
   symbols  shown at the display positions are used to
   determine game outcomes by comparing the displayed symbols
                                             10282092_1 (GHMaters) P101003 AU.1 17/05118

                               -  6
   with defined winning combinations.
   In one conventional type of gaming machine, a display area
   including 15 display positions   is presented to a player
 5 with each display position including one     symbol.             The
   display positions are arranged in five vertically disposed
   reels that define three rows, with each reel corresponding
   with a display position group, and each reel having three
   visible display positions.    After the reels       are spun and
10 subsequently stopped, the display positions         show a random
   selection of symbols.
   Generally, with such games, a plurality of win patterns                        in
   the form of win lines are  defined which extend across the
15 reels and include one display position from each reel.
   Typically the symbols that are disposed in a win line are
   compared with winning symbol combinations defined in a pay
   table so as to determine whether a player of the game
   should receive an award.   For example, if winning symbol
20 combinations are based on poker hands,   a particular prize
   would be awarded if the win line comprises       four aces.
   Other winning symbol combinations and corresponding prizes
   may also be defined.
25 Such a game often comprises normal game mode and special
   game mode. During normal game mode, the displayed symbols
   are compared with base winning combinations defined in a
   pay table.
30 With the present system, during special game mode, the
   gaming system is arranged to implement   a feature game that
   is selected, for example pseudo   randomly,    from a plurality
   of available feature games.
                                              10282092_1 (GHMaters) P101003 AU.1 17/05118

   The present system is also arranged such that prior to
   implementing a base game, a player selects        the number of
   rows of display positions    in the display area by             selecting
 5 an ante bet amount.    The ante bet amount may be selected
   using dedicated physical buttons or using a touch screen,
   and the ante bet amount will typically increase according
   to the number of desired rows.     For example, the ante bet
   amount may be zero   for three rows of display positions, a
10 first amount   of credits  for four rows  of display
   positions,  a second amount of credits that is larger than
   the first amount   of credits  for five rows    of display
   positions,  and a third amount   of credits that is             larger
   than the second amount of credits for six rows             of display
15 positions.
   Referring to the drawings, there is    shown a schematic
   block diagram of a gaming system 10 arranged to implement
   a probabilistic game of the type wherein several symbols
20 from a set  of symbols are   randomly displayed, and a game
   outcome is determined on the basis of the displayed
   symbols.   The  system is of the type  including multiple
   game modes, such as being operable in normal game mode
   wherein a base game is    implemented and special          game mode
25 wherein a feature game    is implemented, and including an
   ante bet component.
   With some such probabilistic games, the set of symbols
   used during normal game mode include     standard symbols and
30 function symbols, and the game outcome is determined on
   the basis of the displayed standard symbols and the
   function associated with any displayed function symbol.
   For example, standard symbols may resemble fruit                such as
                                               10282092_1 (GHMaters) P101003 AU.1 17/05118

                                - 8
   apples, pears and bananas with a win outcome being
   determined when a predetermined number of the same                 fruit
   appear on a display along a win line, or are displayed
   according to defined outcome patterns such as scattered,
 5 and so on.   The function associated with a function symbol
   may be for example a wild function wherein display of the
   function symbol is treated during consideration of the
   game outcome as any of the   standard symbols.          A   function
   symbol may be represented as the word "WILD", a star, or
10 by any other suitable word or symbol.    Other functions are
   also envisaged such as   scatter functions, multiplier
   functions,  repeat win functions,  jackpot   functions and
   feature commencement functions.
15 Referring to Figure   1, a schematic diagram of components
   of a gaming system 10 in accordance with the present
   embodiment is  shown.   The components comprise a player
   interface  30 and a game controller 32.    The player
   interface  30 is arranged to enable interaction between a
20 player and the gaming system and for this purpose includes
   input/output components required for the player to enter
   instructions and play the game.
   Components of the player interface 30 may vary but                 will
25 typically  include a credit mechanism 34 to enable a player
   to input  credits and receive payouts, one or more displays
   36 which may comprise a touch screen, and a game play
   mechanism 38 arranged to enable a player to input game
   play instructions,  including instructions during game play
30 and ante bet selections prior to game play.
   The game controller 32   is in data communication with the
   player interface 30 and typically includes a processor 40
                                              10282092_1 (GHMaters) P101003 AU.1 17/05118

                              - 9
   arranged to process game play instructions and output game
   player outcomes to the display 36.  Typically, the game
   play instructions are stored as program code in a memory
   42 that can also be hardwired.  It will be understood that
 5 in this specification the term "processor" is used to
   refer generically to any device that can process game play
   instructions and may include a microprocessor,
   microcontroller, programmable logic device or other
   computational device such as a personal computer or a
10 server.
   A functional diagram illustrating operative components of
   the game controller 32 is shown in Figure 2.
15 The memory 42 is arranged to store symbols data 13
   indicative of a plurality of symbols, in the present
   example associated with a plurality of reels, win lines
   data 14 indicative of available win lines, base game
   instruction data 15 indicative of base game instructions
20 usable by the gaming machine 10 to control operation of
   the base game, feature game instruction data 16 indicative
   of feature game instructions usable by the gaming machine
   10 to control operation of the feature games, functions
   data 17 indicative of functions applicable during a base
25 game and/or a feature game, and game configuration data 18
   indicative of available configurations for the display
   positions that are selectable by selecting an ante bet
   amount.
30 The game controller 32 includes a base game implementer 19
   arranged to implement a base game, the base game
   implementer 19 having a symbol selector 20 which is
   arranged to select several symbols from the available
                                            10282092_1 (GHMaters) P101003 AU.1 17/05118

                              - 10
   symbols 13 for display to a player in a plurality of
   display positions, in this example by spinning reels
   containing the symbols and stopping the reels so as to
   display at least one symbol on each reel.      In this
 5 example, the selection carried out by the symbol selector
   20 is made using a random number generator 21.
   It will be appreciated that the random number generator 21
   may be of a type which is arranged to generate pseudo
10 random numbers based on a seed number, and that in this
   specification the term "random" will be understood
   accordingly to mean truly random or pseudo random.
   The game controller 32 also includes an ante bet selector
15 23 arranged to facilitate selection by a player of an ante
   bet amount prior to implementation of a base game and
   thereby selection of the number of rows of display
   positions to use in the base game.
20 With this embodiment, the game controller 32 also
   comprises a trigger determiner 24 arranged to determine
   whether a trigger condition exists and to commence a
   feature game when a trigger condition is determined to
   exist.
25
   In order to implement a feature game, the game controller
   32 includes a feature game implementer 25.        In this
   example, multiple feature games are available to a player
   in response to a trigger condition.   The feature game
30 implementer 25 includes a feature selector 26 arranged to
   facilitate selection, in this example pseudo randomly
   using the random number generator 21,  of one of a
   plurality of feature games defined by the feature game
                                            10282092_1 (GHMaters) P101003 AU.1 17/05118

                              -  11
   instructions 16.
   During a feature game, a different game to the base                   game
   is implemented.  In this example, the available feature
 5 games may include a first feature game wherein a jackpot
   amount is awarded to a player based on defined criteria,
   such as selection of a plurality of concealed items                   and a
   determination as to whether the   selected items          correspond
   to a jackpot bonus and the   level of bonus that the
10 selected items correspond to;   a second feature game
   wherein a player is prompted to select one of several,                       for
   example two, items and a prize is awarded, such as an
   award of a defined number of credits or a defined number
   of free games, or an opportunity to play a        jackpot           feature
15 according to the  first feature game;   or a third feature
   game wherein a bonus wheel   spins and subsequently stops to
   select a prize, which may be an award of a defined number
   of credits or a defined number of free games, or an
   opportunity to play a jackpot   feature according to the
20 first feature game.
   The game controller 32 also   comprises an outcome evaluator
   28 which, in accordance with the base game instructions
   15, determines game outcomes based on the      symbols            selected
25 for display to the player by the   symbol selector 20 and,
   during a feature game, based on the   specifications of the
   feature games defined by the feature game instructions 16.
   The game controller 32 also   comprises a prize allocator 29
30 arranged to allocate a prize to a player when a winning
   outcome exists.
   In this example, the gaming system is operable in normal
                                              10282092_1 (GHMatters) P101003 AU.1 17/05118

                              - 12
   game mode and special game mode.
   During normal game mode, a base game is implemented and
   the outcome evaluator 28 determines whether a standard
 5 winning symbol combination exists and a prize is awarded
   to a player for a standard winning symbol combination.
   The number of rows of symbol positions used during the
   base game is determined according to the ante bet selected
   by the player using the ante bet selector 23 prior to
10 commencement of the base game.
   During special game mode, a feature game is implemented,
   with the specification of the feature game determined
   according to which of the available plurality of feature
15 games is selected by the feature selector 26.
   In the embodiment described below, the symbol selector 20,
   the function allocator 22, the ante bet selector 23, the
   trigger determiner 24, the feature selector 26, the
20 outcome evaluator 28, and the prize allocator 29 are at
   least partly implemented using the processor 40 and
   associated software although it will be understood that
   other implementations are envisaged.
25 The gaming system 10 can take a number of different forms.
   In a first form, a player operable gaming device in the
   form of a stand alone gaming machine is provided wherein
   all or most components required for implementing the game
30 are present in the gaming machine.
   In a second form, a distributed architecture is provided
   wherein some of the components required for implementing
                                            10282092_1 (GHMaters) P101003 AU.1 17/05118

                               - 13
   the game are present in a player operable gaming device
   and some of the components required for implementing the
   game are  located remotely relative to the gaming device.
   For example, a "thick client"   architecture may be used
 5 wherein part  of the game is executed on a player operable
   gaming terminal and part of the game is executed remotely,
   such as by a gaming server;   or a "thin client"
   architecture may be used wherein most   of the game is
   executed remotely such as by a gaming server and a player
10 operable gaming terminal is used only to display audible
   and/or visible gaming information to the player and
   receive gaming inputs  from the player.
   However,  it will be understood that other arrangements are
15 envisaged.   For example, an architecture may be provided
   wherein a gaming device is networked to a device server
   and the respective  functions of the gaming machine and the
   gaming server are  selectively modifiable.       For example,
   the gaming system may operate in   stand alone gaming
20 machine mode,  "thick client" mode or "thin client" mode
   depending on the game being played, operating conditions,
   and so on. Other variations will be apparent to persons
   skilled in the art.
25 A gaming system in the  form of a  stand alone gaming
   machine 50 is  illustrated in Figure 3.  The gaming machine
   50 includes a console 52 having a display 54 on which is
   displayed representations of a game   56 that       can be played
   by a player.   A mid-trim 60 of the gaming machine 50
30 houses a bank of buttons  62  for enabling a player to
   interact with the gaming machine, in particular during
   gameplay.   The mid-trim 60 also houses a credit            input
   mechanism 64 which  in this example includes a coin input
                                              10282092_1 (GHMaters) P101003 AU.1 17/05118

                               -  14
   chute  64A and a bill collector 64B.    Other credit input
   mechanisms may also be employed,    for example, a card
   reader for reading a smart    card, debit card or credit
   card.

   information or images  relating to the game.           Further
   artwork and/or information may be provided on a front
10 panel  69 of the console 52.    A coin tray 70 is mounted
   beneath the front panel  69 for dispensing cash payouts
   from the gaming machine 50.
   The display 54 is  in the form of a video display unit,
15 particularly a cathode  ray tube   screen device.
   Alternatively, the display 54 may be a liquid crystal
   display, plasma screen, or any other    suitable video
   display unit.   The top box 66 may also include a display,
   for example a video display unit, which may be of the same
20 type as the display 54,  or of a different      type.          The
   display 54 may comprise a touch screen usable by a player
   to interact with the gaming machine, in particular during
   game play.
25 The display 54 in this example    is arranged to display
   representations of several    reels, each reel of which has
   several  associated symbols.    Typically three, four or five
   reels are provided.   During operation of the game, the
   reels  first appear to rotate then stop with three,                 four or
30 five  symbols visible on each reel.    Game outcomes are
   determined on the basis of the visible symbols             together
   with any special functions associated with the symbols.

   A player marketing module    (PMM) 72 having a display 74 is
   connected to the gaming machine    50.  The main purpose of
   the PMM 72 is to allow the player to interact with a
   player loyalty  system.   The PMM has a magnetic card reader
 5 for the purpose of reading a player tracking device,                      for
   example as part of a loyalty program.     However other
   reading devices may be employed and the player tracking
   device may be in the form of a card, flash drive or any
   other portable storage medium capable of being read by the
10 reading device.   In this example, the PMM 62 is              a Sentinel
   III device produced by Aristocrat Technologies Pty Ltd.
   Figure 4 shows a block diagram of operative components of
   a gaming device 100  which may be the   same as or different
15 to the gaming machine shown in Figure 3.
   The gaming machine  100  includes a game controller 101
   having a processor 102.    Instructions and data to control
   operation of the processor 102    in accordance with the
20 present invention are   stored in a memory    103 which is in
   data communication with the processor 102.
   Typically, the gaming machine 100 will    include both
   volatile and non-volatile memory and more than one of each
25 type of memory, with such memories being collectively
   represented by the memory 103.
   Figure 5 shows a block diagram of the main components of
   an exemplary memory  103.   The memory  103 includes RAM
30 103A, EPROM 103B and a mass    storage device 103C.                The RAM
   103A typically temporarily holds program files for
   execution by the processor 102 and related data.                   The
   EPROM 103B may be a boot ROM device and/or may contain
                                               10282092_1 (GHMatters) P101003 AU.1 17/05118

                              -  16
   some system or game related code.    The mass storage device
   103C is typically used to store game programs, the
   integrity of which may be verified and/or authenticated by
   the processor 102 using protected code from the EPROM 103B
 5 or elsewhere.
   The gaming machine has hardware meters 104 for purposes
   including ensuring regulatory compliance and monitoring
   player credit, an input/output   (I/O) interface 105               for
10 communicating with a player interface 120 of the gaming
   machine 100, the player interface 120 having several
   peripheral devices.   The input/output interface 105 and/or
   the peripheral devices may be intelligent devices with
   their own memory for storing associated instructions and
15 data for use with the input/output interface or the
   peripheral devices.   A random number generator module 113
   generates random numbers for use by the processor 102.
   In the example shown in Figure 4, the peripheral devices
20 that communicate with the game controller 101 comprise one
   or more displays 106, a touch screen and/or bank of
   buttons 107,  a card and/or ticket reader 108, a printer
   109, a bill acceptor and/or coin input mechanism 110 and a
   coin output mechanism 111.   Additional hardware may be
25 included as part of the gaming machine 100,         or hardware
   may be omitted as required for the specific
   implementation.
   In addition, the gaming machine 100 may include a
30 communications interface, for example a network card 112.
   The network card may, for example, send status
   information, accounting information or other information
   to a central controller, server or database and receive
                                              10282092_1 (GHMaters) P101003 AU.1 17/05118

                               -  17
   data or commands from the central controller, server or
   database.
   It is also possible for the operative components of the
 5 gaming machine  100 to be distributed, for example
   input/output devices 106,107,108,109,110,111 may be
   provided remotely from the game    controller 101.
   Figure  6 shows a gaming system 200 in accordance with an
10 alternative embodiment.   The gaming system 200           includes a
   network 201, which  for example may be an Ethernet network,
   a LAN or a WAN.   In this example, three banks 203 of two
   gaming machines 202  are connected to the network 201.                       The
   gaming machines 202  provide a player operable interface
15 and may be the  same as the gaming machines 40,100                shown in
   Figures  3 and 4, or may have simplified functionality
   depending on the requirements for implementing game play.
   While banks 203 of two gaming machines are illustrated in
   Figure  6, banks of one, three or more gaming machines are
20 also envisaged.
   One or more displays 204 may also be connected to the
   network 201.   The displays   204 may, for example, be
   associated with one or more banks 203 of gaming machines.
25 The displays 204 may be used to display representations
   associated with game play on the gaming machines 202,
   and/or used to display other representations, for example
   promotional or informational material.
30 In a thick client embodiment,    a game server 205 implements
   part of the game played by a player using a gaming machine
   202 and the gaming machine 202 implements part of the
   game. With this embodiment, as both the game          server 205
                                              10282092_1 (GHMatters) P101003 AU.1 17/05118

                               -  18
   and the gaming machine  202   implement part of the game,
   they  collectively provide a game controller. A database
   management  server 206 may manage   storage of game programs
   and associated data  for downloading or access by the
 5 gaming devices 202  in a database 206A. Typically, if the
   gaming system enables players to participate in              a Jackpot
   game, a Jackpot server  207 will be provided to monitor and
   carry out the  Jackpot game.
10 In a variation of the above thick client embodiment, the
   gaming machine 202  may implement the game, with the                  game
   server 205  functioning merely to   serve data indicative of
   a game to the gaming machine 202    for implementation.
15 With this  implementation, a data   signal containing a
   computer program usable by the client terminal to
   implement the gaming system may be transferred from the
   game server to the  client terminal,   for example           in
   response to a request by the client terminal.
20
   In a thin client embodiment, the game server 205
   implements most or all of the game played by a player
   using a gaming machine  202 and the gaming machine 202
   essentially provides only the player interface.                With this
25 embodiment, the game server    205 provides the game
   controller. The gaming machine will    receive player
   instructions, and pass the    instructions to the game server
   which will process them and return game play outcomes to
   the  gaming machine for display.    In a thin client
30 embodiment, the gaming machines could be computer
   terminals,  e.g. PCs running software that provides a
   player interface operable using standard computer input
   and output components.
                                               10282092_1 (GHMaters) P101003 AU.1 17/05118

                               -  19
   Servers are also typically provided to assist in the
   administration of the gaming system 200, including                  for
   example a gaming floor management server 208 and a
 5 licensing server 209 to monitor the use of licenses
   relating to particular games.     An administrator terminal
   210  is provided to allow an administrator to monitor the
   network 201 and the devices   connected to the network.
10 The gaming system 200 may communicate with other gaming
   systems, other local  networks such as a corporate network,
   and/or a wide area network such as the Internet,                for
   example through a firewall 211.
15 A loyalty program server 212 may also be provided.
   Persons  skilled in the art will appreciate that in
   accordance with known techniques,    functionality           at the
   server side of the network may be distributed over a
20 plurality of different computers.     For example, elements
   may be run as a single   "engine" on one server or a
   separate server may be provided.     For example, the game
   server 205 could run a random number generator engine.
   Alternatively, a separate random number generator                 server
25 could be provided.
   Examples of specific implementations of the gaming system
   will now be described in relation to a stand alone gaming
   machine 50 although it will be understood that
30 implementation may also be carried out using other gaming
   system architectures such as a network architecture of the
   type  shown in Figure 6.
                                               10282092_1 (GHMaters) P101003 AU.1 17/05118

                                -  20
    In this example, the gaming system comprises          five reels,
    each reel corresponding to a display position group having
    an associated set of display positions for displaying
    symbols, and the display position configurations include
  5 three,  four, five or six rows of display positions that
    are selectable by a player selecting a respective ante bet
    amount.
    The reels are arranged during a base game to display
10  standard symbols and one or more function symbols, and win
    outcomes are  determined on the basis of the symbols
    visible at the display positions when the reels             stop
    rotating.
15  Prior to commencement of base game play, a player                selects
    the  desired ante bet amount using the ante bet           selector
    23, which defines the number of rows that will be used in
    the base game.   For example, the ante bet     amount may be
    zero  for three rows  of display positions, a first amount
20  of credits  for four rows of display positions, a second
    amount of credits that   is larger than the    first amount of
    credits for five rows of display positions, and a third
    amount of credits that   is larger than the    second amount                   of
    credits for six rows of display positions.
25
    Typically, a player will also purchase or otherwise obtain
    win entitlements such as   several win lines which are used
    in the game to determine win outcomes.    If the displayed
    symbols  on the reels  have symbols associated with a
30  winning combination such as a winning combination disposed
    on a win line, the player wins a prize.
    The ante bet selected may also determine the number of win
                                               10282092_1 (GHMaters) P101003 AU.1 17/05118

                               -  21
   lines that are used in the base game to determine win
   outcomes.   For example, if no ante bet is      selected, 15
   lines may be provided, if a first level ante bet is
   selected, 30 lines may be provided, if a second level ante
 5 bet  is selected, 45 lines may be provided, and if a third
   level ante bet is   selected, 60  lines may be provided.
   Each ante bet  selection and associated number of win lines
   may also correspond to a different return to player                    (RTP).
   For example, if no ante bet   is selected, the RTP may be
10 88.94%,  if a first  level ante bet is  selected, the RTP may
   be  90.31%, if a second level ante bet   is   selected, the RTP
   may be  92.16%, and if a third level ante bet is             selected,
   the RTP may be  91.36%.
15 The gaming system is operable in normal game mode and
   special  game mode and may be arranged to commence                special
   game mode when a predetermined game outcome occurs.
   Special game mode may comprise one    or more free           games.
   Special game mode may commence automatically on the basis
20 of a game event occurring during a game such as              display of
   a particular symbol, based on game outcomes determined by
   the  gaming system, or may be prompted by a player pressing
   a button on the gaming system 10 after the player has
   identified that a game outcome    corresponding to special
25 game mode requirements has occurred.
   The gaming system 10 may also be arranged so as to
   determine eligibility for special game mode, for example
   based on the amount or type of bet placed, based on
30 particular time periods and so on.
   Special game mode may also be arranged to commence when a
   special  game is purchased by a player.
                                               10282092_1 (GHMaters) P101003 AU.1 17/05118

   A specific example will now be described in relation to
   flow diagram 250 shown in Figure 7 which illustrates steps
   252 to 270 of a method of gaming implemented by the gaming
 5 system according to the present embodiment.
   Before implementation of a base game a player selects 254
   the desired ante bet, and as a consequence a defined
   number of rows of symbol display positions are defined
10 256.  The base game is then implemented 258 by spinning
   and subsequently stopping the reels to show a plurality of
   symbols 294 in the display area 290. The displayed symbols
   are evaluated 260 and prizes awarded according to winning
   combinations of symbols 294 appearing in the display area
15 290.
   In this example, during a base game five virtual reels
   280, 282, 284, 286, 288 are provided and displayed on a
   graphical display device 54 in a display area 290, as
20 shown in Figure 8. Each reel 280, 282, 284,       286, 288
   corresponds to a display position group, and each reel
   comprises three, four or five display positions 292 for
   displaying symbols 294. In the example shown in Figure 8,
   no ante bet has been selected and this corresponds to
25 three rows, and therefore three display positions 292 are
   shown for each reel and three rows of display positions
   are defined.  It will be understood that any number of
   reels may be provided, and a different number of rows may
   be selected by selecting a different ante bet.
30
   Winning symbol combinations may include common poker game
   winning combinations such as three of a kind, four of a
   kind, straights, flushes etc. A standard symbol winning
                                            10282092_1 (GHMatters) P101003 AU.1 17/05118

                              - 23
   combination may be achieved if symbols that form part of
   the standard winning combination are displayed at defined
   display positions on the reels.
 5 Example display areas 290 that include four or five rows
   corresponding to different ante bet amounts are
   respectively shown in Figures 9 and 10.
   If a trigger condition exists 262, special game mode
10 commences which causes implementation of a feature game.
   In this embodiment, three feature games are available, and
   the system randomly selects 264 one of the feature games.
   The selected feature game may include one or more
15 individual games. In an example illustrated in Figure 11,
   the trigger condition 262 is display of a special
   'dragon's eye' symbol 296.
   An example first feature game is shown in Figure 12.                    Like
20 and similar features are indicated with like reference
   numerals.
   During implementation of the first feature game, each
   display position displays a jackpot 'dragon' symbol 298.
25 Each dragon symbol 298 is associated with a jackpot type,
   in this example mini, minor, maxi, major or grand that
   correspond to progressively increasing jackpot amounts.
   The player is directed to select successive dragon symbols
   298 until three of the same jackpot type have been
30 selected.  When this occurs, the player is awarded the
   jackpot amount corresponding to the jackpot type.
   An example second feature game is shown in Figure 13.
                                            10282092_1 (GHMaters) P101003 AU.1 17/05118

                               - 24
   Like and similar features are indicated with like
   reference numerals.
   During implementation of the second feature game, a player
 5 is prompted to select one  of several,  for example two,
   feature  'amulet' symbols 300,  302 and a prize is awarded
   according to the amulet  symbol 300,  302 selected.                In this
   example, the prizes may include an award of a defined
   number of credits or a defined number of free games, or an
10 opportunity to play a jackpot   feature according to the
   first feature game.
   An example third feature game is   shown in Figure 14.                    Like
   and similar features are indicated with like reference
15 numerals.
   During implementation of the third feature game, a bonus
   wheel 304  that includes a selector 306 and multiple
   available prizes 308 spins and subsequently stops to
20 select a prize, which may be an award of a defined number
   of credits or a defined number of free games, or an
   opportunity to play a jackpot   feature according to the
   first feature game.
