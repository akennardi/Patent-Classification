        NOVEL COMPOSITIONS FOR PREVENTING AND/OR TREATING
     DEGENERATIVE DISORDERS OF THE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM
                            FIELD OF THE INVENTION
[0001]         The present invention provides novel compounds, known as
pharmacological chaperones, as well as compositions and methods using the
same for preventing and/or treating degenerative disorders of the central nervous
system. In particular, the present invention provides methods for preventing
and/or treating Parkinson's disease.
                       BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
[00021         Many degenerative disorders of the central nervous system are
associated with pathologic aggregation of proteins or lipids. For example,
synucleinopathies are a group of diseases that arise from disruption of synuclein
protein homeostasis. In particular, alpha-synuclein aggregation is associated
with pathological conditions characterized by Lewy bodies, such as Parkinson's
disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and multiple system atrophy. Likewise,
alpha-synuclein fragment, non-Abeta component, is found in amyloid plaques of
Alzheimer's disease. Recently, enhancement of glucocerebrosidase (beta
glucosidase; GCase) activity in the brain has been shown to prevent
accumulation of synuclein in the brain (Sean Clark, Ying Sun, You-Hai Xu,
Gregory Grabowski, and Brandon Wustman, "A biochemical link between
Gaucher and Parkinson's disease and a potential new approach to treating
synucleinopathies: a pharmacological chaperone for beta-glucocerebrosidase
prevents accumulation of alpha-synuclein in a Parkinson's mouse model,"
Presented at the Society for Neuroscience Annual Meeting, San Diego, CA,
2007). Thus, agents that enhance GCase activity may provide relief for patients
at risk for developing or diagnosed with degenerative disorders of the central
nervous system.

[00031          There is a need for new therapeutic compounds that can be used to
prevent and/or treat degenerative disorders of the central nervous system that
provide patients with a higher quality of life and achieve a better clinical outcome.
In particular, there is a need for new therapeutic compounds to prevent and/or
treat synucleinopathies such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease
that provide patients with a higher quality of life and achieve a better clinical
outcome.

[00411          Parkinson's disease may be diagnosed in patients according to the
United Kingdom Parkinson's Disease Society brain-bank clinical diagnostic
criteria (see, Hughes et al., Accuracy of clinical diagnosis of idiopathic
Parkinson's disease: a clinico-pathological study of 100 cases. J Neurol
Neurosurg Psychiatry 1992; 55:181-184) and/or the criteria described by Gelb et
                                             19

al., Diagnostic Criteria for Parkinson's Disease. Arch Neurol. 1999; 56(1):33-39.
Likewise, the severity of Parkinson's disease may be ascertained using the
Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale. See, e.g., Fahn and Elton, Members
of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale Development Committee.
Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale. In: Fahn et al., Recent developments
in Parkinson's disease. New York: Macmillan, 1987: 153-163.
[0042]         Alzheimer's disease may be diagnosed in patients according to the
criteria for dementia of the Alzheimer's type of the Diagnostic and Statistical
Manual of Mental Disorders,    4 th ed.: DSM-IV. Washington, D.C.: American
Psychiatric Association, 1994. Likewise, the criteria for probable Alzheimer's
disease may be ascertained based on criteria of the National Institute of
Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the Alzheimer's
Disease and Related Disorders Association. See also, McKhann et al., Clinical
diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease: report of the NINCDS-ADRDA work group
under the auspices of Department of Health and Human Services Task Force on
Alzheimer's Disease. Neurology 1984; 34:939-944.
[00431         Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is characterized by glial cytoplasmic
inclusion bodies (also known as Papp-Lantos bodies) in the movement, balance
and automatic control centers of the brain. The most common first sign of MSA
is the appearance of an "akinetic-rigid syndrome" (i.e., slowness of initiation of
movement resembling Parkinson's disease) found in 62% at first presentation.
Other common signs at onset include problems with balance (found in 22%),
followed by genito-urinary problems (9%). For men, the first sign can be erectile
dysfunction (unable to achieve or sustain an erection). Both men and women
often experience problems with their bladders including urgency, frequency,
incomplete bladder emptying or an inability to pass urine (retention). About 1 in 5
MSA patients will suffer a fall in their first year of disease. As the disease
progresses three groups of symptoms predominate. These are: (i) parkinsonism
(slow, stiff movement, writing becomes small and spidery); (ii) cerebellar
dysfunction (difficulty coordinating movement and balance); and (iii) autonomic
dysfunction (impaired automatic body functions) including: postural or orthostatic
                                             20

hypotension, resulting in dizziness or fainting upon standing up, urinary
incontinence, impotence; constipation; dry mouth and skin; trouble regulating
body temperature due to abnormal sweating; abnormal breathing during sleep.
Notably, not all of these symptoms are experienced by all patients.
[0044]            Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is one of the most common
types of progressive dementia. The central feature of DLB is progressive
cognitive decline, combined with three additional defining features: (1)
pronounced "fluctuations" in alertness and attention, such as frequent
drowsiness, lethargy, lengthy periods of time spent staring into space, or
disorganized speech; (2) recurrent visual hallucinations, and (3) parkinsonian
motor symptoms, such as rigidity and the loss of spontaneous movement.
 People may also suffer from depression. The symptoms of DLB are caused by
the build-up of Lewy bodies - accumulated bits of alpha-synuclein protein -
inside the nuclei of neurons in areas of the brain that control particular aspects of
memory and motor control. Researchers don't know exactly why alpha-synuclein
accumulates into Lewy bodies or how Lewy bodies cause the symptoms of DLB,
but they do know that alpha-synuclein accumulation is also linked to Parkinson's
disease, multiple system atrophy, and several other disorders, which are referred
to as the "synucleinopathies." The similarity of symptoms between DLB and
Parkinson's disease, and between DLB and Alzheimer's disease, can often make
it difficult for a doctor to make a definitive diagnosis. In addition, Lewy bodies are
often also found in the brains of people with Parkinson's and Alzheimer's
diseases. These findings suggest that either DLB is related to these other
causes of dementia or that an individual can have both diseases at the same
time. DLB usually occurs sporadically, in people with no known family history of
the disease. However, rare familial cases have occasionally been reported.

[1,4]dioxino[2,3-c]pyridin-8-yl)methanol Hydrochloride(2).                  A solution of 1
(20.0 g, 55.0 mmol) in MeOH (500 mL) was combined with Pd(OH)2 (4-6 g) and
ammonium formate (14 g, 220 mmol) and the mixture was heated at 50-55 "C.
Additional amounts (3x100.0 mmol) of ammonium formate were added over the
next 8 hrs. After the final addition, the reaction mixture was further stirred and
heated an additional 16 hrs at 50-55        4C.    The catalyst was removed by filtration
and the filtrate was evaporated in vacuo. The crude product was dissolved in
acetone (150 mL), filtered, and HCI in 2-PrOH was added. After seeding and
                                              30

then cooling in an ice bath, the product was collected as a white crystalline solid
(11.0 g, 71%).      1H NMR (DMSO-d6) 9.45 (s, 2H), 4.80 (t, 1H, ex), 3.85 (m, 1H),

dimethyloctahydro-[1,4]dioxino[2,3-c]pyridin-8-yl)methanol           (3).     To   a
solution of 2 (14.85 g, 50.0 mmol) in DMF (200 mL) was added K2CO3 (17.25 g,
125 mmol) and the mixture was stirred at 40       0C for about 4 hrs. At this point,
BnCl (5.7 mL, 50.0 mmol) was added in one portion and the reaction was stirred
at 40   0C  overnight. The solvent was evaporated in vacuo and the residue was
suspended in water (600 mL) and HCI was added to dissolve the residue. The
solution was washed with Et2O and then basified with Na2CO3. The solution
was extracted with EtOAc (2x) and the combined extracts were washed with
water and then brine and then dried over MgSO4. The solution was filtered and
the filtrate evaporated in vacuo to give the title compound (17.2 g, >95%) as a
colorless to very pale yellow viscous oil which was used without further
purification. 1H NMR (CDCl3) 7.3 (m, 5H), 3.6-3.8 (m, 2H), 3.5 (s, 3H), 3.4 (t,

dimethyloctahydro-[1,4]dioxino[2,3-c]pyridin-8-yl)carboxaldehyde (General
Procedure A) (4). To a solution of DMSO (7.3 g, 96.9 mmol) in CH2Cl2 (150
mL) cooled to -78 IC was added a solution of oxalyl chloride (6.1 mL, 72.8 mmol)
in CH2Cl2 dropwise. After the addition was complete the reaction mixture was
stirred for an additional 30 min at which point a solution of 3 (17.0 g, 48.4 mmol)
in CH2Cl2 was added dropwise. After addition was complete, the reaction was
stirred for 1 hr at -78   0C  and then diisopropylethylamine (34.4 mL, 193 mmol)
was added dropwise.        After this addition was complete, the cooling bath was
removed and the reaction mixture was allowed to warm to 0 "C when saturated
NaHCO3 was added. The mixture was diluted with some additional CH2Cl2 and
then the organic layer was separated and dried over MgSO4. After filtering, the
                                           31

solvent was evaporated in vacuo and the crude product was purified by silica gel
chromatography (Hex/EtOAc) to give the title compound (12.7 g, 75%) as a
viscous oil. 1H NMR (CDCl3) 9.73 (s, 1H), 7.2 (m, 5H), 3.75 (m, 2H), 3.5 (q, 2H),

(General Procedure B) (5).         To a solution of DAST (1.4 mL, 10.3 mmol) in
CH2Cl2 (50 mL) cooled to -15 "C was added a solution of 4 (2.4 g, 6.9 mmol)
dropwise. After 10 minutes, the ice bath was removed and the reaction was
stirred at room temperature overnight. At this point the reaction mixture was
again cooled in an ice bath and the reaction was quenched by addition of
saturated NaHCO3 (dropwise at first since this does produce a slight exotherm).
The organic layer was separated and dried over Na2SO4, filtered and the solvent
was evaporated in vacuo to give a yellow oil.        The residue was purified by
chromatography on silica gel (Hex/EtOAc) to give the title compound         (1.6 g,
62%) as a colorless oil. 1H NMR (CDCl3) 7.2 (m, 5H), 6.0 (dt, 1H), 3.75 (m,

in a mixture of EtOH/H2O/HCI (40 mL/40 mL/5 mL) and the reaction monitored
by HPLC until the starting material could no longer be detected. The solvent was
evaporated in vacuo and then co-evaporated 2x with EtOH. The residue was
dissolved in MeOH and hydrogenated over Pd(OH)2.             When complete, the
catalyst was removed by filtration and the filtrate evaporated in vacuo.       The
residue was recrystallized from EtOH (50 mL) to the title compound (0.55 g,
66%) as a white solid (mp 168-170 "C). 1H NMR (D20) 6.15 (dt, 1H), 4.3-4.8 (m,

Salts, solvates and prodrugs
[00771         Compounds of the present invention include pharmaceutically
acceptable salts, solvates and pro-drugs of the compounds disclosed herein.
Pharmaceutically acceptable salts include salts derived from inorganic bases
such as Li, Na, K, Ca, Mg, Fe, Cu, Zn, Mn; salts of organic bases such as NN'
diacetylethylenediamine, glucamine, triethylamine, choline, hydroxide,
dicyclohexylamine, metformin, benzylamine, trialkylamine, thiamine; chiral bases
like alkylphenylamine, glycinol, phenyl glycinol, salts of natural amino acids such
as glycine, alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, norleucine, tyrosine, cystine,
cysteine, methionine, proline, hydroxy proline, histidine, omithine, lysine,
arginine, serine; non-natural amino acids such as D-isomers or substituted amino
acids; guanidine, substituted guanidine wherein the substituents are selected
from nitro, amino, alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, ammonium or substituted ammonium
salts and aluminum salts. Salts may include acid addition salts where
appropriate which are, hydrochlorides, sulphates, nitrates, phosphates,
perchlorates, borates, hydrohalides, acetates, tartrates, maleates, citrates,
succinates, palmoates, methanesulphonates, benzoates, salicylates,
benzenesulfonates, ascorbates, glycerophosphates, ketoglutarates. In one
embodiment, the pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the compounds disclosed
herein is the hydrochloride salt.
[00781         "Solvate" denotes a physical association of a compound with one or
more solvent molecules. This physical association involves varying degrees of
ionic and covalent bonding, including hydrogen bonding. In certain instances the
solvate will be capable of isolation, for example when one or more solvent
molecules are incorporated in the crystal lattice of the crystalline solid. "Solvate"
encompasses both solution-phase and isolatable solvates. "Hydrate" is a solvate
wherein the solvent molecule is H2 0. Other non-limiting examples of suitable
solvates include alcohols (e.g., ethanolates, methanolates, and the like).
[0079]         Prodrugs are compounds which are converted in vivo to active
forms (see, e.g., R. B. Silverman, 1992, "The Organic Chemistry of Drug Design
                                           48

and Drug Action", Academic Press, Chapter 8, incorporated herein by reference).
Additionally, a discussion of prodrugs is provided in T. Higuchi and V. Stella, Pro
drugs as Novel Delivery Systems, Volume 14 of the A.C.S. Symposium Series,
and in Bioreversible Carriers in Drug Design, Edward B. Roche, ed., American
Pharmaceutical Association and Pergamon Press, 1987, both of which are
incorporated herein by reference thereto. Prodrugs can be used to alter the
biodistribution (e.g., to allow compounds which would not typically enter the
reactive site of the protease) or the pharmacokinetics for a particular compound.
For example, a carboxylic acid group, can be esterified, e.g., with a methyl group
or an ethyl group to yield an ester. When the ester is administered to a subject,
the ester is cleaved, enzymatically or non-enzymatically, reductively, oxidatively,
or hydrolytically, to reveal the anionic group. An anionic group can be esterified
with moieties (e.g., acyloxymethyl esters) which are cleaved to reveal an
intermediate compound which subsequently decomposes to yield the active
compound.
[0080]         Examples of prodrugs and their uses are well known in the art
(See, e.g., Berge et al. (1977) "Pharmaceutical Salts", J. Pharm. Sci. 66:1-19).
The prodrugs can be prepared in situ during the final isolation and purification of
the compounds, or by separately reacting the purified compound with a suitable
derivatizing agent. For example hydroxy groups can be converted into esters via
treatment with a carboxilic acid in the presence of a catalyst. Examples of
cleavable alcohol prodrug moieties include substituted and unsubstituted,
branched or unbranched lower alkyl ester moieties, (e.g., ethyl esters), lower
alkenyl esters, di-lower alkyl-amino lower-alkyl esters (e.g., dimethylaminoethyl
ester), acylamino lower alkyl esters, acyloxy lower alkyl esters (e.g.,
pivaloyloxymethyl ester), aryl esters (phenyl ester), aryl-lower alkyl esters (e.g.,
benzyl ester), substituted (e.g., with methyl, halo, or methoxy substituents) aryl
and aryl-lower alkyl esters, amides, lower-alkyl amides, di-lower alkyl amides,
and hydroxy amides.
[0081]         All stereoisomers (for example, geometric isomers, optical isomers
and the like) of the compounds disclosed herein (including those of the salts,
                                           49

solvates and prodrugs of these compounds as well as the salts and solvates of
the prodrugs), such as those which may exist due to asymmetric carbons on
various substituents, including enantiomeric forms (which may exist even in the
absence of asymmetric carbons), rotameric forms, atropisomers, and
diastereomeric forms, are contemplated within the scope of this invention.
Individual stereoisomers of these compounds may, for example, be substantially
free of other isomers, or may be admixed, for example, as racemates or with all
other, or other selected, stereoisomers. The chiral centers of the aforementioned
compounds can have the S or R configuration as defined by the IUPAC 1974
Recommendations. The use of the terms "salt", "solvate" "prodrug" and the like,
is intended to equally apply to the salt, solvate and prodrug of enantiomers,
stereoisomers, rotamers, tautomers, racemates or prodrugs of the compounds of
the present invention disclosed herein.
Formulations
[0082]          The therapeutic agent(s) can be formulated to be suitable for any
route of administration, including e.g., orally in the form of tablets or capsules or
liquid, or in sterile aqueous solution for injection. When the therapeutic agent(s)
is formulated for oral administration, tablets or capsules can be prepared by
conventional means with pharmaceutically acceptable excipients such as binding
agents (e.g., pregelatinized maize starch, polyvinylpyrrolidone or hydroxypropyl
methylcellulose); fillers (e.g., lactose, microcrystalline cellulose or calcium
hydrogen phosphate); lubricants (e.g., magnesium stearate, talc or silica);
disintegrants (e.g., potato starch or sodium starch glycolate); or wetting agents
(e.g., sodium lauryl sulphate). The tablets may be coated by methods well
known in the art. Liquid preparations for oral administration may take the form of,
for example, solutions, syrups or suspensions, or they may be presented as a dry
product for constitution with water or another suitable vehicle before use. Such
liquid preparations may be prepared by conventional means with
pharmaceutically acceptable additives such as suspending agents (e.g., sorbitol
syrup, cellulose derivatives or hydrogenated edible fats); emulsifying agents
                                           50

(e.g., lecithin or acacia); non-aqueous vehicles (e.g., almond oil, oily esters,
ethyl alcohol or fractionated vegetable oils); or preservatives (e.g., methyl or
propyl-p-hydroxybenzoates or sorbic acid). The liquid preparations may also
contain buffer salts, flavoring, coloring or sweetening agents as appropriate.
Preparations for oral administration may be suitably formulated to give controlled
or sustained release of the therapeutic agent(s).
[0083]          In certain embodiments of the present invention, the therapeutic
agent(s) is administered in a dosage form that permits systemic uptake, such that
the therapeutic agent(s) may cross the blood-brain barrier so as to exert effects
on neuronal cells. For example, pharmaceutical formulations of the therapeutic
agent(s) suitable for parenteral/injectable use generally include sterile aqueous
solutions (where water soluble), or dispersions and sterile powders for the
extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersion. In all
cases, the form must be sterile and must be fluid to the extent that easy
syringability exists. It must be stable under the conditions of manufacture and
storage and must be preserved against the contaminating action of
microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi. The carrier can be a solvent or
dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, polyol (for example,
glycerol, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, and the like), suitable mixtures
thereof, or vegetable oils. The proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by
the use of a coating such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle
size in the case of dispersion and by the use of surfactants. Prevention of the
action of microorganisms can be brought about by various antibacterial and
antifungal agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, benzyl alcohol,
sorbic acid, and the like. In many cases, it will be reasonable to include isotonic
agents, for example, sugars or sodium chloride. Prolonged absorption of the
injectable compositions can be brought about by the use in the compositions of
agents delaying absorption, for example, aluminum monosterate or gelatin.
[0084]          Sterile injectable solutions are prepared by incorporating the
therapeutic agent(s) in the required amount in the appropriate solvent with
various of the other ingredients enumerated above, as required, followed by filter
                                            51

or terminal sterilization. Generally, dispersions are prepared by incorporating the
various sterilized active ingredients into a sterile vehicle which contains the basic
dispersion medium and the required other ingredients from those enumerated
above. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable
solutions, the preferred methods of preparation are vacuum drying and the
freeze-drying technique which yield a powder of the active ingredient plus any
additional desired ingredient from previously sterile-filtered solution thereof.
[0085]          The formulation can contain an excipient. Pharmaceutically
acceptable excipients which may be included in the formulation are buffers such
as citrate buffer, phosphate buffer, acetate buffer, and bicarbonate buffer, amino
acids, urea, alcohols, ascorbic acid, phospholipids; proteins, such as serum
albumin, collagen, and gelatin; salts such as EDTA or EGTA, and sodium
chloride; liposomes; polyvinylpyrollidone; sugars, such as dextran, mannitol,
sorbitol, and glycerol; propylene glycol and polyethylene glycol (e.g., PEG-4000,
PEG-6000); glycerol; glycine or other amino acids; and lipids. Buffer systems for
use with the formulations include citrate; acetate; bicarbonate; and phosphate
buffers. Phosphate buffer is a preferred embodiment.
[00861          The formulation can also contain a non-ionic detergent. Preferred
non-ionic detergents include Polysorbate 20, Polysorbate 80, Triton X-100, Triton
X-114, Nonidet P-40, Octyl a-glucoside, Octyl p-glucoside, Brij 35, Pluronic, and
Tween 20.
Routes ofAdministration
[00871          The therapeutic agent(s) may be administered orally or
parenterally, including intravenously, subcutaneously, intra-arterially,
intraperitoneally, ophthalmically, intramuscularly, buccally, rectally, vaginally,
intraorbitally, intracerebrally, intradermally, intracranially, intraspinally,
intraventricularly, intrathecally, intracisternally, intracapsularly, intrapulmonarily,
intranasally, transmucosally, transdermally, or via inhalation. In one preferred
embodiment, the therapeutic agent(s) is administered orally.
                                            52

[00881          Administration of therapeutic agent(s) may be by periodic injections
of a bolus of the formulation, or may be administered by intravenous or
intraperitoneal administration from a reservoir which is external (e.g., an i.v. bag)
or internal (e.g., a bioerodable implant). See, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,407,957 and
5,798,113, each incorporated herein by reference. Intrapulmonary delivery
methods and apparatus are described, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,654,007,
5,780,014, and 5,814,607, each incorporated herein by reference. Other useful
parenteral delivery systems include ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer particles,
osmotic pumps, implantable infusion systems, pump delivery, encapsulated cell
delivery, liposomal delivery, needle-delivered injection, needle-less injection,
nebulizer, aerosolizer, electroporation, and transdermal patch. Needle-less
injector devices are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,879,327; 5,520,639; 5,846,233
and 5,704,911, the specifications of which are herein incorporated by reference.
Any of the formulations described above can be administered using these
methods.
[0089]          Subcutaneous injections have the advantages allowing self
administration, while also resulting in a prolonged plasma half-life as compared
to intravenous administration. Furthermore, a variety of devices designed for
patient convenience, such as refillable injection pens and needle-less injection
devices, may be used with the formulations of the present invention as discussed
herein.
Dosage
[00901          A suitable pharmaceutical preparation is in a unit dosage form. In
such form, the preparation is subdivided into suitably sized unit doses containing
appropriate quantities of the active component, e.g., an effective amount to
achieve the desired purpose. In certain embodiments, the therapeutic agent(s) is
administered in one or more daily doses (e.g., once-a-day, twice-a-day, thrice-a
day). In certain embodiments, the therapeutic agent(s) is administered in
intermittently.
                                          53

[00911         Exemplary dosing regimens are described in International patent

regimen that includes an initial "loading dose" given daily, followed by a period of
non-daily interval dosing.
[0092]         The amount of effective therapeutic agent(s) for preventing or
treating the referenced disorder can be determined on a case-by-case basis by
those skilled in the art. The amount and frequency of administration of the
therapeutic agent(s) will be regulated according to the judgment of the attending
clinician (physician) considering such factors as age, condition and size of the
patient as well as risk for developing disorder or severity of the symptoms of the
referenced disorder being treated.

                                       EXAM PLES
[00116]         The present invention is further described by means of the
examples, presented below. The use of such examples is illustrative only and in
no way limits the scope and meaning of the invention or of any exemplified term.
Likewise, the invention is not limited to any particular preferred embodiments
described herein. Indeed, many modifications and variations of the invention will
be apparent to those skilled in the art upon reading this specification. The
invention is therefore to be limited only by the terms of the appended claims
along with the full scope of equivalents to which the claims are entitled.
EXAMPLE 1 Determination of Inhibition Constants
[00117]         The binding affinity (defined here by Ki binding constant) of GCase
for novel compounds of the present invention were empirically determined using
enzyme inhibition assays. In brief, the enzyme inhibition assays used monitored
the ability of a test compound to bind and prevent the hydrolysis of a fluorogenic
substrate in a concentration-dependent manner. Specifically, the enzyme activity
of recombinant human GCase (rhGCase; Cerezyme@, Genzyme Corp.) was
measured using the 4-methylumbelliferyl-p-D-glucopyranoside (4-MU-p-D-Glc)
                                            63

fluorogenic substrate in the absence or in the presence of varying amounts of
each test compound. The resultant data were analyzed by comparing all test
samples to the no inhibition control sample (no compound; corresponding to
100% enzyme activity) to determine the residual enzyme activity in the presence
of test compound. The normalized residual activity data were subsequently
graphed (on y-axis) relative to the concentration of test compound (on x-axis) to
extrapolate the test compound concentration which leads to 50% inhibition of
enzyme activity (defined as IC50 ). The IC50 value for each test compound was
then inserted into the Cheng-Prusoff equation (detailed below) to derive the
absolute inhibition constant Ki that accurately reflects the binding affinity of
GCase for the test compound. The enzyme inhibition assays were performed at
both pH 7.0 (endoplasmic reticulum pH) and at pH 5.2 (lysosomal pH) to gain
insight into the binding affinity (i.e., potency) of compounds for GCase in the
endoplasmic reticulum and lysososome.
In vitro assay
[00118]        Various concentrations of test compounds were prepared in buffer
"M"consisting of 50mM sodium phosphate buffer with 0.25% sodium
taurocholate at pH 7.0 and pH 5.2. Enzyme (Cerezyme@, a recombinant form of
the human enzyme p-glucocerebrosidase) was also diluted in the same buffer
"M" at pH 7.0 and pH 5.2. The substrate solution consisted of 3 mM 4
methylumbelliferone p-D-glucopyranoside in buffer "M" with 0.15% Triton X-100
at both pH's. Five microliters of diluted enzyme was added to 15 p1 of the various
inhibitor concentrations or buffer "M" alone and incubated at 370 C for 1 hour with
50 pl of the substrate preparation to assess p-glucosidase activity at pH 7.0 and
pH 5.2. Reactions were stopped by addition of an equal volume of 0.4 M glycine,
pH 10.6. Fluorescence was measured on a plate reader for 1 sec/well using 355
nm excitation and 460 nm emission. Incubations without added enzyme or
without added inhibitors were used to define no enzyme activity and maximum
activity, respectively, and normalize % inhibition for a given assay. The results of
                                             64

In situ assay
[00119]          The effect of the novel compounds of the present invention on
lysosomal GCase activity was assayed in situ using fibroblasts established from
a normal subject. Cells seeded in 48-well plates were incubated with the
indicated concentrations of compound for 16-24 hours. For the dose-response
assays, cells were incubated with the in situ substrate 5
(pentafluorobenzoylamino)fluorescein di-p-D-glucopyranoside (PFBFDpGlu) for 1
hour and subsequently lysed to determine the extent of substrate hydrolysis in
the presence of compound. The assay employed a range of 12 concentrations
                                                65

encompassing 5 orders of magnitude, centered on the IC50. Specifically, the
following concentration ranges were employed: (3R,4R,5S)-5
(difluoromethyl)piperidine-3,4-diol, (3R,4R,5S)-5-(1-fluoroethyl)piperidine-3,4
diol, (3R,4R,5R)-5-(1 -hydroxyethyl)-piperidine-3,4-diol, (3R,4R,5S)-5-((R)-1
fluoropropyl)piperidine-3,4-diol hydrochloride, and (3R,4R,5S)-5
benzylpiperidine-3,4-diol: 1.0  x 10-3 to 3.0 x 10-9 M; (3R,4R,5R)-5-(1
hydroxyethyl)-piperidine-3,4-diol: 1.0 x 10-4 to 3.0 x 10-10 M; and (3R,4R,5S)-5-(1
fluoroethyl)piperidine-3,4-diol: 1.0 x 10-3 to 3.0 x 10-11 M; wherein compound was
serially diluted 1:3 from the highest concentration in the ranges specified.
Inhibition was determined as the ratio of activity in the presence of compound to
that in the absence of compound. For the washout assays, cells were treated
with compound for 16-24 hours at a concentration equal to the IC90. Cells were
washed extensively and incubated in drug-free medium to allow net compound
efflux from cells. Cells were then tested for lysosomal GCase activity at 2 hour
intervals over a total period of 8 hours following compound removal. The
increase in activity over time was fitted with a single exponential function to
determine the compound's washout time. The results of these in situ inhibition
assays for reference compound IFG-tartrate and several test compounds are
summarized below in Table 2B.

[001201            When compared to reference compound IFG-tartrate, the following
is notable: (i) test compounds (3R,4R,5S)-5-(difluoromethyl)piperidine-3,4-diol,
(3R,4R,5S)-5-(1-fluoroethyl)piperidine-3,4-diol, (3R,4R,5R)-5-(1-hydroxyethyl)

hydrochloride, and (3R,4R,5S)-5-benzylpiperidine-3,4-diol, were found to cause a
concentration-dependent increase in GCase activity and enhanced enzyme
activity to the same maximum level as reference compound IFG-tartrate at much
lower concentration; (ii) test compounds (3R,4R,5S)-5-(difluoromethyl)piperidine
                                                 67

benzylpiperidine-3,4-diol, washed out of the lysosomal compartment (in situ
washout) considerably faster than reference compound IFG-tartrate; and (iii), test
compounds (3R,4R,5S)-5-(difluoromethyl)piperidine-3,4-diol, (3R,4R,5S)-5-(1
fluoroethyl)piperidine-3,4-diol, (3R,4R,5R)-5-(1-hydroxyethyl)-piperidine-3,4-diol,

EXAMPLE 2: Blood brain barrier penetration
[00121]        The blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetration of reference compound
IFG-tartrate and several compounds of the present invention (i.e., (3R,4R,5S)-5
(difluoromethyl)piperidine-3,4-diol, (3R,4R,5S)-5-(1-fluoroethyl)piperidine-3,4
diol, (3R,4R,5R)-5-(1 -hydroxyethyl)-piperidine-3,4-diol, (3R,4R,5S)-5-((R)-1
fluoropropyl)piperidine-3,4-diol hydrochloride, and (3R,4R,5S)-5
benzylpiperidine-3,4-diol) were assayed after oral administration to mice. For
this purpose, 8-week old wild-type male mice (C57BL/6) were administered a
single 30 mg/kg (free base equivalent) p.o. dose of reference or test compound
by gavage (n = 3 mice per time point). Dosing solutions were prepared in water.
After dosing, mice were euthanized with CO2 at the following time points: 0-, 0.5-,
1-, and 4-hour post-dose. After euthanization, whole blood was collected from
the inferior vena cava into lithium heparin tubes. Similarly, brains were collected
from each mouse. Plasma was derived by spinning whole blood at 2,700 x g for
10 minutes at 4'C followed by storage on dry ice. Whole brains were washed in
cold PBS to remove contaminating blood, blotted dry, flash frozen on dry ice, and
ultimately stored at -80'C until analysis. To prepare brain samples for analysis,
50-100 mg of tissue was homogenized in 400 ptl of water/mg tissue. Samples
were then clarified by centrifugation. Next, 25 pl of the brain homogenate
supernatant or 25 pl of plasma were combined with 25 tl of acetonitrile:water
(95/5). This was supplemented with 25 ptl of acetonitrile and 50 pL of internal
standard (100 ng/mL IFG-tartrate 13C2-15N in 0.5% formic acid in (70:30)
                                          68

acetonitrile:methanol). Samples were again clarified by centrifugation and 75 pl
of the supernatant was combined with 75 pl of acetonitrile. Samples were then
analyzed for compound levels by LC-MS/MS at PPD Inc. (3230 Deming Way,
Middleton, WI 53562). In brief, a Thermo Betasil, Silica-100, 50 x 3mm, 5 t
column equilibrated with a mixture of mobile phase consisting of 5 mM
ammonium formate and 0.05% formic acid in (A) 95:5 acetonitrile:water or (B)
70:20:10 methanol:water:acetonitrile was employed. Between 20 and 30 pl
sample was injected for analysis. For calculating drug concentrations, raw data
for plasma (ng/mL) and brain (ng/g) was converted to nM using the molecular
weight of respective compounds and assuming 1 g of tissue is equivalent to 1 mL
volume. Concentration as a function of time was plotted in GraphPad Prism
version 4.02.
[00122]        The plasma levels and brain levels detected in mice administered a
single 30 mg/kg (free base equivalent) p.o. dose of reference compound (i.e.,
IFG-tartrate) or test compound (i.e., (3R,4R,5S)-5-(difluoromethyl)piperidine-3,4
diol, (3R,4R,5S)-5-(1-fluoroethyl)piperidine-3,4-diol, (3R,4R,5R)-5-(1
hydroxyethyl)-piperidine-3,4-diol, (3R,4R,5S)-5-((R)-1 -fluoropropyl)piperidine-3,4
diol hydrochloride, or (3R,4R,5S)-5-benzylpiperidine-3,4-diol) reflect that
(3R,4R,5S)-5-(difluoromethyl)piperidine-3,4-diol, (3R,4R,5S)-5-(1
fluoroethyl)piperidine-3,4-diol, (3R,4R,5S)-5-((R)-1-fluoropropyl)piperidine-3,4
diol hydrochloride, and (3R,4R,5S)-5-benzylpiperidine-3,4-dio crossed the blood
brain barrier more readily as compared to IFG-tartrate. Additionally, higher levels
of (3R,4R,5S)-5-(difluoromethyl)piperidine-3,4-diol, (3R,4R,5S)-5-(1
fluoroethyl)piperidine-3,4-diol, (3R,4R,5S)-5-((R)-1-fluoropropyl)piperidine-3,4
diol hydrochloride, and (3R,4R,5S)-5-benzylpiperidine-3,4-dio were detected in
brain than that observed following administration of IFG-tartrate.

EXAMPLE 3: GCase enhancement
[00123]        The ability of orally administered test compounds ((3R,4R,5S)-5
(difluoromethyl)piperidine-3,4-diol, (3R,4R,5S)-5-(1-fluoroethyl)piperidine-3,4
diol, (3R,4R,5S)-5-((R)-1-fluoropropyl)piperidine-3,4-diol hydrochloride, or
(3R,4R,5S)-5-benzylpiperidine-3,4-diol) to elevate GCase levels was assessed in
mice. For this purpose, 8-week old wild-type male mice (C57BL/6) were
administered a single p.o. (gavage) dose of a compound of the present invention
(i.e., (3R,4R,5S)-5-(difluoromethyl)piperidine-3,4-diol, (3R,4R,5S)-5-(1
fluoroethyl)piperidine-3,4-diol, (3R,4R,5S)-5-((R)-1-fluoropropyl)piperidine-3,4
diol hydrochloride, or (3R,4R,5S)-5-benzylpiperidine-3,4-diol). Details of the
dose administered for each compound are provided in Tables 3A and 3B. The
dosing solutions were prepared in water. Compounds were administered over 2
weeks as follows: week 1, Mon-Fri (On), Sat-Sun (Off); week 2, Mon-Thu (On);
necropsy on Friday. Thus, a total of 9 doses (dosing solutions prepared fresh
every day) were given to each mouse, with a 24-hour washout between the last
dose and necropsy.
[00124]        After completion of dosing, mice were euthanized with C02 and
whole blood was drawn into lithium heparin tubes from the inferior vena cava.
Plasma was collected by spinning blood at 2700g for 10 minutes at 40C. Liver,
spleen, lung, and brain tissues were removed, washed in cold PBS, blotted dry,
flash frozen on dry ice, and stored at -80'C until analysis. GCase levels were
measured by homogenizing approximately 50 mg tissue in 500 IL McIlvane (MI)
buffer (100 mM sodium citrate, 200 mM sodium phosphate dibasic, 0.25%
sodium taurocholate, and 0.1% Triton X-100, pH 5.2) at pH 5.2 for 3-5 seconds
on ice with a micro homogenizer. Homogenates were then incubated at room
temperature without and with 2.5 mM conduritol-B-epoxide (CBE) for 30 min.
Finally, 3.7 mM 4-methylumbeliferryl-p-glucoside (4-MUG) substrate was added
and incubated at 371C for 60 min. Reactions were stopped by addition of 0.4 M
glycine, pH 10.6. Fluorescence was measured on a plate reader for 1 sec/well
using 355 nm excitation and 460 nm emission. Total protein was determined in
lysates using the MicroBCA kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. A 4
                                           70

methylumbelliferone (4-MU) standard curve ranging from 1.0 nM to 50 piM was
run in parallel for conversion of raw fluorescence data to absolute GCase activity
(in the presence and absence of CBE) and expressed as nanomoles of 4-MU
released per milligram of protein per hour (nmol/mg protein/hr). GCase levels
and protein levels were calculated using Microsoft Excel (Redmond, WA) and
GraphPad Prism version 4.02.
[00125]        Tables 3A and 3B summarize the dose administered for each
compound examined in mice as described above as well as the resultant level of
GCase enhancement in brain and spleen, respectively, compound concentration
in tissue, compound concentration in GCase assay and inhibition constant (Ki).

EXAMPLE 4: Rat pharmacokinetics
[00127]        Pharmacokinetic (PK) data was obtained in rats to assess the
bioavailability of test compound. In particular, the following PK parameters were
calculated: bioavailability as measured by area under the Concentration/Time
curve (AUC), fraction of dose available (%F; further defined below), clearance
(CL), volume of distribution (Vd), and half-life (t1%). For this purpose, 8-week old
Sprague-Dawley male rats were given either a single intravenous (IV) dose
equivalent to 3 mg/kg of free base or single escalating p.o. (gavage) doses of
test compound equivalent to 10, 30, and 100 mg/kg of free base. Three rats
were used per dosing group. Blood was collected over a 24-hr period. The time
points for blood collection after intravenous administration were: 0, 2.5, 5, 10, 15,
30, 45 min, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 hrs; time points for blood collection after p.o.
administrations were: 0, 5, 15, 30, 45 min, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12, and 24 hrs. Plasma
samples were analyzed for compound levels by LC-MS/MS at PPD. Raw data
was analyzed by non-compartmental analysis in Win-nonLin to calculate         VD, %F,
CL, and ty.
