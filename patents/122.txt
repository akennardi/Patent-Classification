   Field of the Invention
10 The present invention relates to automated winder for moving a window between open
   and closed positions.
   Background of Invention
15 Winders are commonly used for opening and closing windows, window panels, window
   frames, awnings and the like. Additionally, the extent to which they open may also be
   controlled by the winders.                                Such window winders conventionally have a chain
   connected to a window, the chain being moveable so as to affect movement of the
   window.
20
   Winders are typically split into two broad categories, manual and automatic winders.
   Manual winders typically have a rotational handle requiring manual labour as an input
   to wind the chain which ultimately results in movement between open and closed
   positions of a window or awning.                             Manual winders often require a substantial amount
25 of energy and time to operate.                                The operation of manual winders is particularly
   difficult for aged home owners with limited dexterity and especially for hard to reach
   sashes.
   Automated winders typically replace the rotational handle of a manual winder with an
30 electric motor. Whilst this may reduce the effort required to open or close a window,
   for example, they are typically more expensive than manual winders and cost more to
   install. This is largely because of the additional parts required and because a qualified
   electrician is needed to complete the installation process.                            Automated winders are
   typically powered by mains power (230v) and include a multitude of separate parts.
35 These winders may also be complex to maintain and operate due to the plurality of

    :\tId\Interwovn\NRPortbl\DCC\TLD\16141727_l.doc-19 12/2017
                                                                       -2
   parts required in the system.                               The operation of automated winders may be difficult,
   especially for an aged person due to its complexity.
   It is generally desirable to overcome or ameliorate one or more of the above described
 5 difficulties, or to at least provide a useful alternative.
   Summary of Invention
   In accordance with the present invention, there is provided an automated winder for
10 moving a window between open and closed positions, including:
                    (a)            an input device and a motor driver, wherein the input device:
                                   (i)            receives user input to move the window towards an open
                                                  position or a closed position; and
15                                 (ii)           sends a corresponding activation signal to the motor driver;
                    (b)            a motor and a transmission mechanically coupled thereto,
                    wherein, on receipt of an activation signal from the input device, the motor
   driver actuates the motor so as to move the transmission towards a closed position or
   an open position.
20
   Preferably, when the driver receives the activation signal from the input device, the
   driver actuates the motor by transmitting electrical energy to the motor.
   Preferably, the winder further includes a gearbox mechanically coupled between the
25 motor and the transmission, wherein, after the motor receives electrical energy from
   the driver, the motor converts the electrical energy to rotational energy and transmits
   the rotational energy to the gearbox.
   Preferably, the input device, the driver and the motor are adapted to be electrically
30 powered by one or more batteries.                                   The one or more batteries are preferably
   removable.
   Preferably, the winder further including a photovoltaic system for charging the one or
   more batteries.

   Detailed Description of Embodiments of the Invention
   The automated winder 10 shown in Figure 1 is used to move a window 12, for
   example, between open and closed positions in the manner shown in Figure 2.                                  The
25 winder 10 makes opening or closing a window or awning simpler, faster and more
   convenient. The winder 10 removes the need to exert manual labour to change a
   position of a window between open and close.
   As shown in Figure 1, the winder includes:
30
                    (a)            an input device 14 and a motor driver 16, wherein the input device:
                                   (i)            receives user input to move the window 12 towards an open
                                                  position or a closed position; and
                                   (ii)           sends a corresponding activation signal to the motor driver 16;
35                  (b)            a motor 18 and a transmission 20 mechanically coupled thereto.

    1:
     \td\Intrwovn\NRPortbl\DCC\TLD\16141727_l.doc-19 12/2017
                                                                 -4
   On receipt of an activation signal from the input device 14, the motor driver 16
   actuates the motor 18 so as to move the transmission 20 towards a closed position or
   an open position.
 5
   When the driver 16 receives the activation signal from the input device 14, the driver
    16 actuates the motor 18 by transmitting electrical energy to the motor 18.
   The window 16 includes a window frame 22 and a framed glassed section coupled to
10 the frame by a hinge so as to rotate between the open position shown in Figure 1 and
   a closed position. As shown in Figures 1 and 2, the winder 10 is coupled to the frame
   22 and the transmission 20 is coupled to the framed glass section 24.
   Alternatively, the window 12 is any other type of window that includes movement of
15 the glassed section 24 with respect to the frame 22. In these alternate configurations
   of the window 12, the transmission 20 is used to drive the window between open and
   closed positions.                      For ease of description, we have below described operation of the
   winder 10 with reference to the window 16 shown in Figures 1 and 2. Of course, it is
   to be understood that the winder 10 can be used with any such alternative windows.
20
   The transmission is preferably a chain. Alternatively, the transmission 20 is any other
   suitable means for transmitted the rotational movement of the motor 18 to linear
   movement so as to open or close the window 12. The transmission 20 is adapted to
   engage a window 12 or awning which moves with the linear movement of the
25 transmission 20. Movement of the transmission 20 results in the window 12 or awning
   to move to one of the following positions:
                   (a)           fully open;
                   (b)           fully close; and
30                 (c)           between fully open and fully close.
   As particularly shown in Figure 3, the window winder 10 also includes a gearbox 26
   mechanically coupled between the motor 18 and the transmission 20. After the motor
    18 receives electrical energy from the driver 16, the motor 18 converts the electrical
35 energy to rotational energy and transmits the rotational energy to the gearbox 26.

                                                                       -5
   The gearbox 26 is preferably a reduction gearbox which acts to reduce rotational
   speed of the motor 18 and increases torque.
   A coupling 28 between the gearbox 26 and the transmission 20 converts the reduced
 5 rotational speed and increased torque to linear movement of the transmission 20. The
   coupling 28 is preferably a cog mechanically coupled to the gearbox 26 for axial
   rotation.               In addition, the transmission 20 is positioned to run over the teeth of the
   cog so as to convert the rotational movement in direction                           DR from the gearbox 26 to
   linear movement in direction DL
10
   As particularly shown in Figure 3, the input device 14 includes a switch 406 for
   sending an activation signal to the driver 16.                                The switch 406 is preferably a
   mechanical switch configured to complete an electrical circuit. Preferably, the switch
   406 includes two buttons, one for moving the window towards a open position and the
15 other to move the window towards a close position.
   The input device 14 preferably includes a receiver 402 for receiving wireless
   transmission signals. The wireless receiver 402 is preferably a BluetoothTM receiver in
   communication with a microcontroller 408. The BluetoothTM receiver 402 receives user
20 input from                   a mobile computer device 30 and sends an                     input signal to the
   microcontroller 408. The microcontroller 408 sends an activation signal to the driver
    16.
   The input device 14 preferably includes an infrared sensor 404 and a microcontroller
25 408. The infrared sensor 404 receives user input by detecting user motion, the
   infrared              sensor sends an                     input signal to the   microcontroller 408   and the
   microcontroller 408 sends an activation signal to the driver 16. The user motion is,
   for example, a hand gesture.
30 The user input received by the input device 14 includes one of the following:
                   (a)           a signal to start the motor; and
                   (b)           a signal to stop the motor.

                                                                   -6
   The activation signal sent to the motor 18 includes the polarity of the motor
   associated with one of the following:
                  (a)           a clockwise rotation; or
 5                (b)           an anti-clockwise rotation.
   The input device 14, the driver 16 and the motor 18 are adapted to be electrically
   powered by one or more batteries 410. The one or more batteries 410 are preferably
   removable.                 This facilitates quick and easy installation of the winder 10 and obviates
10 the need for an electrician to wire winder into mains power.
   In another embodiment, the winder 10 further includes photovoltaic system 34 which
   absorbs solar energy from the sun 36 and converts it to electricity which is used to
   charge the one or more batteries 410.                            The photovoltaic system 34 includes one or
15 more photovoltaic (PV) modules 38 which constitute a PV array.                               The photovoltaic
   system 34 is preferably configured to trickle charge the one or more batteries 410 in a
   manner which continuously tops up the battery for continuous use.                             This eliminates
   the need for mains charging of the one or more batteries 410. Preferably, the system
   34 is also configured to charge the one or more batteries 410 from a flat or no power
20 state.
   As shown in Figure 4, the winder 10 includes a housing 32 formed in front and back
   parts 32a and 32b. The back part 32b is removable from the front part 32a so that
   the user can access the batteries 410 for replacement thereof.
25
   The winder 10 is adapted to be coupled to a sill of window frame 22 in a manner
   shown in Figure 2 using any suitable fastener, such as screws.
   Process 500
30
   The interoperation of the components of winder 10 is shown in Figure 5.                          As shown, If
   the input device 14 detects a user input by switch 406, the switch 406 sends an
   activation signal to the motor driver 16.                           The motor driver 16 then amplifies the
   activation signal.                     If the input device 14 detects a user input by BluetoothTM 402 or
35 infrared            sensor 404,                  the input device   14 sends an    activation signal to the

    :\tId\Interwovn\NRPortbl\DCC\TLD\16141727_l.doc-19 12/2017
                                                               -7
   microcontroller 408 which receives the user input signal and outputs an activation
   signal to the motor driver 16.
   If the motor driver 16 receives an activation signal from the input device 14, it
 5 receives electrical energy from the one or more batteries 410. The motor driver 16
   then transmits the electrical energy to the motor 18.                     The motor 18 receives the
   electrical energy from the motor driver 16 and converts the electrical energy to
   rotational motion.
10 The rotational motion of the motor 18 is mechanically coupled to a gearbox 26 which
   decreases the rotational speed and increases the torque of the motor 18. A coupling
   28 between the gearbox 26 and the transmission 20 converts the reduced rotational
   speed and increased torque to linear movement of the transmission 20. Movement of
   the transmission 20 results in the window 12 or awning to move to one of the
15 following positions:
                    (a)            fully open;
                    (b)            fully close; and
                    (c)            between fully open and fully close.

   Mobile Computer Device 30
   Figure 6 is a block diagram showing an exemplary mobile computer device 30 in which
   embodiments of the invention may be practiced. The mobile device 12 may be a
25 mobile computer device such as a smart phone, a personal data assistant (PDA), a
   palm-top computer, and multimedia Internet enabled cellular telephones. For ease of
   description, the mobile computer device 30 is described below, by way of non-limiting
   example, with reference to a mobile device in the form of an iPhone                 TM manufactured
   by AppleTM, Inc. or one manufactured by LGTM, HTCTM and Samsung TM, for example.
30
   As shown, the mobile computer device 30 includes the following components in
   electronic communication via a bus 206:
                    (a)            a display 202;

                  (c)           random access memory ("RAM") 208;
                  (d)           N processing components 210;
                  (e)           a transceiver component 212 that includes N transceivers; and
                  (f)           user controls 214.

   Although the components depicted in Figure 6 represent physical components, Figure
   6 is not intended to be a hardware diagram. Thus, many of the components depicted
   in Figure 6 may be realized by common constructs or distributed among additional
   physical components.                             Moreover, it is certainly contemplated that other existing and
10 yet-to-be developed physical components and architectures may be utilized to
   implement the functional components described with reference to Figure 6.
   The display 202 generally operates to provide a presentation of content to a user, and
   may be realized by any of a variety of displays (e.g., CRT, LCD, HDMI, micro-projector
15 and OLED displays).
   In general, the non-volatile data storage 204 (also referred to as non-volatile
   memory) functions to store (e.g.,                               persistently store) data and executable code
   including code that is associated with the functional components of application
20 programs, including the Automated Winder Application (App) 218.
   In some embodiments for example, the non-volatile memory 204 includes bootloader
   code, modem software, operating system code, file system code, and code to facilitate
   the implementation components of one or more portions of the App 218 as well as
25 other components well known to those of ordinary skill in the art, which are not
   depicted nor described for simplicity.
   In many implementations, the non-volatile memory 204 is realized by flash memory
   (e.g., NAND or ONENAND memory),                                   but it is certainly contemplated that other
30 memory types may be utilized as well.                               Although it may be possible to execute the
   code from the non-volatile memory 204, the executable code in the non-volatile
   memory 204 is typically loaded into RAM 208 and executed by one or more of the N
   processing components 210.
35 The N processing components 210 in connection with RAM 208 generally operate to

   execute the instructions stored in non-volatile memory 204. As one of ordinarily skill
   in the art will appreciate, the N processing components 210 may include a video
   processor, modem processor, DSP,                            graphics processing unit (GPU),  and other
   processing components.

   The transceiver component 212 includes N transceiver chains, which may be used for
   communicating with external devices via wireless networks. Each of the N transceiver
   chains may represent a transceiver associated with a particular communication
   scheme. For example, each transceiver may correspond to protocols that are specific
10 to local area networks, cellular networks (e.g., a CDMA network, a GPRS network, a
   UMTS networks), and other types of communication networks.                              The transceiver
   component 212 may also include a Bluetooth communication module.
   It should be recognized that Figure 6 is merely exemplary and in one or more
15 exemplary embodiments, the functions described herein may be implemented in
   hardware, software, firmware, or any combination thereof.                            If implemented    in
   software, the functions may be stored on or transmitted over as one or more
   instructions or code encoded on a non-transitory computer-readable medium 204.
