CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION
[0001]    This is a divisional application of Australian Patent Application No. 2013280972, the
entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.
BACKGROUND
Technical Field
[0002]    The present disclosure relates to surgical instruments and, more particularly, to
microwave antenna probes for applying energy, e.g., microwave energy, to tissue to treat tissue,
e.g., ablate tissue.
Background ofRelated Art
[0003]    Treatment of certain diseases requires destruction of malignant tissue growths, e.g.,
tumors. It is known that tumor cells denature at elevated temperatures that are slightly lower
than temperatures injurious to surrounding healthy cells. Known treatment methods, such as
hyperthermia therapy, are utilized to heat tumor cells above the temperature necessary to destroy
the tumor cells, while maintaining adjacent healthy cells at lower temperatures to avoid
irreversible damage to the surrounding healthy cells. Such methods typically involve applying
electromagnetic radiation to heat tissue, e.g., to ablate and/or coagulate tissue. In particular,
microwave energy is used to ablate and/or coagulate tissue to denature or kill cancerous cells.
There are several types of microwave antenna probes, e.g., monopole probes and dipole probes,
that are currently used to radiate microwave energy generally perpendicularly from the axis of
the probe to treat adjacent tissue.
SUMMARY
[0004]    As used herein, the term "distal" refers to the portion that is being described which is
further from a user, while the term "proximal" refers to the portion that is being described which
is closer to a user. Further, to the extent they are consistent with one another, any of the aspects
described herein may be used in conjunction with any of the other aspects described herein.

                                                   2
[0005]    In accordance with one aspect, the present invention provides a surgical device,
comprising:
       a feedline configured to couple to a source of energy;
       a radiating portion configured to deliver energy to tissue;
       a distal end member disposed distal to the radiating portion; and
an electrically conductive joint disposed between the feedline and the radiating portion, the
electrically conductive joint configured to prevent relative movement between the radiating
portion and the distal end member.
[0006]    In accordance with another aspect, the present invention provides a surgical device,
comprising:
          a radiating portion configured to deliver energy to tissue;
          a distal end member disposed distal to the radiating portion; and
          an electrically conductive flexible joint disposed proximal to the radiating portion, the
electrically conductive flexible joint configured to prevent relative movement between the
radiating portion and the distal end member.
[0007]    In accordance with at least an embodiment, a surgical probe is provided generally
including a connection hub, an antenna assembly, and an outer jacket. The antenna assembly is
coupled to the connection hub and extends distally from the connection hub. A radiating portion
is coupled to the antenna assembly at the distal end of the antenna assembly. The radiating
portion is configured to deliver energy to tissue to treat tissue. The outerjacket is coupled to the
connection hub and also extends distally from the connection hub. The outer jacket is disposed
about the radiating portion and including a distal end member configured to be spaced-apart
from the radiating portion a target axial distance. One or more of the coupling between the
antenna assembly and the connection hub, the coupling between the radiating portion and the
antenna assembly, and the coupling between the outer jacket and the connection hub defines a
flexible configuration permitting axial movement therebetween to maintain the target axial
distance between the radiating portion and the distal end member.
[0008]    In one embodiment, the radiating portion is coupled to the antenna assembly via a
flexible conductive joint configured to electrically couple the radiating portion and the antenna
assembly to one another and to permit relative axial movement of the radiating portion with
respect to the antenna assembly.

                                                   3
[0009]     In another embodiment, a spacer is interdisposed between the distal end member and
the radiating portion. The spacer is configured to flex the one or more flexible couplings to
maintain the target axial distance between the radiating portion and the distal end member. The
spacer may be formed from a substantially rigid material, a compressible material, or an
expandable material. Further, the spacer may be formed from a dissolvable material.
[0010]     In another embodiment, fluid is configured to be circulated within the connection hub
and the outer jacket at a pre-determined pressure to flex the one or more flexible couplings to
maintain the target axial distance between the radiating portion and the distal end member. In
such an aspect, a pressure sensor configured to sense the fluid pressure within the connection
hub and the outer jacket may also be provided.
[0011]     In still another embodiment, the antenna assembly includes a transition sealingly
coupled to the connection hub via a flexible coupling. The flexible coupling allows the antenna
assembly to be axially movable relative to the connection hub. Further, a clip may be provided
for engagement about the connection hub to inhibit axial movement of the antenna assembly
relative to the connection hub.
[0012]     In yet another embodiment, the outer jacket includes a ferrule sealingly coupled to the
connection hub via a flexible coupling. The flexible coupling allows the outer jacket to be
axially movable relative to the connection hub. Further, a clip may be provided for engagement
about the connection hub to inhibit axial movement of the outer jacket relative to the connection
hub.
[0013]     In still yet another embodiment, the distal end member includes a trocar configured to
facilitate penetration through tissue.
[0014]     In accordance with at least one embodiment, a surgical probe is provided generally
including an antenna assembly, an outer jacket, and a phase-change material. The antenna
assembly defines a radiating portion configured to deliver energy to tissue to treat tissue. The
outer jacket is disposed about the radiating portion and includes a distal end member configured
to be spaced-apart from the radiating portion a target axial distance. The phase-change material
is disposed within the outer jacket and substantially surrounds the radiating portion. The phase
change material is transitionable, upon activation of the antenna assembly, between a solid state,

                                                  4
for maintaining the target axial distance between the distal end member and the radiating
portion, and a fluid state, for absorbing heat to maintain the antenna assembly in a relatively
cooled state during use.
[0015]    In one embodiment, the energy delivered from the radiating portion to tissue effects
heating of the phase-change material such that the phase-change material is transitioned from
the solid state to the fluid state.
[0016]    In another embodiment, the distal end member includes a trocar configured to facilitate
penetration through tissue.
[0017]    Another surgical probe provided in accordance with at least an embodiment generally
includes a connection hub, an antenna assembly, and an outer jacket. The antenna assembly
extends distally from the connection hub and includes a radiating portion coupled thereto at the
distal end of the antenna assembly. The radiating portion is configured to deliver energy to
tissue to treat tissue. The outer jacket likewise extends distally from the connection hub and is
disposed about the radiating portion. The outer jacket includes a distal end member and a
ferrule engaged thereto. The ferrule is operably coupled to the connection hub and is axially
movable relative to the connection hub to axially translate the distal end member relative to the
radiating portion to achieve a target axial spacing therebetween.
[0018]    In one embodiment, rotation of the ferrule relative to the connection hub effects axial
translation of the distal end member relative to the radiating portion.
[0019]    In another embodiment, the ferrule includes a threaded annular flange configured to
operably engage complementary threading of the connection hub such that rotation of the ferrule
relative to the connection hub effects axial translation of the distal end member relative to the
radiating portion.
[0020]    In another embodiment, the ferrule further includes a base configured for insertion into
the connection hub to sealingly engage the ferrule within the connection hub.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0039]    It has been found that, with respect to surgical instruments configured to apply energy
to tissue to treat tissue, proper spacing between the energy radiating portion or portions and the
other components of the instrument helps facilitate optimal performance of the instrument.
With respect to microwave ablation probes in particular, it has been found that proper axial
spacing between the distal end of the radiating portion of the antenna assembly and the proximal
surface of the base of the trocar helps ensure optimal performance of the microwave antenna
probe. More specifically, if the axial distance between the distal end of the radiating portion and
the proximal surface of the trocar is too large, the ablation zone (ablation shape) may be sub
optimal and complete ablation of tissue may not be readily achieved. Likewise, where the axial
distance between the distal end of the radiating portion and the proximal surface of the trocar is
too small, ablation performance may be degraded. Accordingly, maintaining optimal axial
spacing, e.g., the target axial distance, between the radiating portion and the trocar during use
helps facilitate optimal performance.

                                                    7
[0040]     The optimal axial spacing, e.g., the target axial distance, between the radiating portion
and the trocar may depend on the dimensions and configuration of the microwave antenna
probe, and may be determined empirically, experimentally, or in any other suitable fashion.
Variation in the axial distance from probe to probe may arise from inconsistent lengths or sizes
of the individual components, variation in the engagements between or positions of the various
components relative to one another, inconsistencies in assembly (particularly with respect to
user-assembled devices), and/or other factors. The various embodiments of probes described in
detail hereinbelow are configured to overcome some or all of these factors that contribute to
variation in axial distance, thereby maintaining the target axial distance during use and, thus,
facilitating optimal performance of the probe.
[0041]     Turning now to Figs. 1-7, a microwave ablation system provided in accordance with
the present disclosure is shown generally identified by reference numeral 10. Microwave
ablation system 10 includes a microwave antenna probe 12 configured to couple to a microwave
generator (not shown) via a flexible coaxial cable 16. Although the present disclosure is shown
and described with reference to microwave antenna probes, the present disclosure is equally
applicable for use in determining and/or setting a particular distance between components of any
suitable energy-based surgical instrument. For the purposes herein, microwave antenna probe
12 is generally described.
[0042]     With continued reference to Figs. 1-7, microwave antenna probe 12 generally includes
an antenna assembly 20, an outer jacket and trocar assembly 70, and a connection hub 80.
Antenna assembly 20 defines a longitudinal axis "X-X" and includes a radiating section that
defines a dipole configuration, e.g., the radiating section includes a feed gap 43 and proximal
and distal radiating portions 42, 44. A feedline 30 extends proximally from the radiating section
into connection hub 80, ultimately coupling to cable 16 via transition 60 to connect antenna
assembly 20 to the generator (not shown) for supplying energy thereto. Feedline 30 defines a
coaxial configuration having an inner conductor 32 surrounded by an insulator 34. Insulator 34,
in turn, is surrounded by an outer conductor 36, thus defining the coaxial configuration of
feedline 30. Feedline 30 may be formed from a semi-rigid or flexible coaxial cable, although
other configurations are also contemplated.
[0043]     As mentioned above, and with reference to Figs. 2, 4, and 6-7, the radiating section of
antenna assembly 20 includes feed gap 43, proximal radiating portion 42, and distal radiating

                                                  8
portion 44. Feed gap 43 is defined by the portion of inner conductor 32 and insulator 34 of
feedline 30 that extends distally from outer conductor 36, e.g., outer conductor 36 may be
stripped from the distal end of coaxial feedline 30 to define feed gap 43. Proximal radiating
portion 42 is defined by the portion of feedline 30 disposed between the proximal end of feed
gap 43 and the distal end of the choke 50. Distal radiating portion 44 is attached to feed gap 43
via any suitable process and extends distally therefrom. For example, as shown in Fig. 7, distal
radiating portion 44 may be soldered to inner conductor 32 of feed gap 43 to establish
electromechanical contact therebetween.
 [0044]   Antenna assembly 20, as shown in Figs. 2, 4, and 6-7, further includes a choke or balun
50 disposed about feedline 30. Choke 50 includes an inner dielectric layer and an outer
conductive layer. Choke 50 may be a quarter-wavelength shorted choke that is shorted to outer
conductor 36 of feedline 30 at the proximal end of choke 50, although other configurations are
contemplated. The dielectric layer of choke 50 may also be configured to extend distally
beyond the conductor layer thereof towards the distal end of antenna assembly 20.
 [0045]   With additional reference to Fig. 3, as mentioned above, antenna assembly 20 includes
a transition 60 from which feedline 30 extends. Feedline 30 extends into transition 60, wherein
inner conductor 32 is coupled to an inner conductor (not explicitly shown) of coaxial cable 16
and outer conductor 36 is coupled to an outer conductor (not explicitly shown) of coaxial cable
 16, while maintaining the spacing therebetween via an insulator (not explicitly shown). Cable
 16 may be secured to feedline 30 within transition 60 via soldering, laser welding, or any other
suitable process for establishing electromechanical contact therebetween. Transition 60 is
disposed within proximal port 83 of connection hub 80 and is sealingly engaged therein via 0
ring 62. More specifically, during assembly, the radiating section and feedline 30 of antenna
assembly 20 are inserted through proximal port 83 and lumen 82 of connection hub 80 such that
transition 60 may ultimately be inserted into proximal port 83 of connection hub 80 to sealingly
engage transition 60 within proximal port 83 of connection hub 80 via O-ring 62. Antenna
assembly 20 may be engaged within connection hub 80 during manufacturing, or may be
assembled by the user.
 [0046]   Outer jacket and trocar assembly 70, as best shown in Figs. 1-5, includes an outer
jacket 72 configured to surround antenna assembly 20, e.g., proximal and distal radiating
portions 42, 44, feed gap 43, and feedline 30, such that a coolant fluid may be circulated

                                                    9
thereabout to maintain antenna assembly 20 in a relatively cooled state during use. A ferrule 74
is molded or otherwise engaged about outer jacket 72 towards the proximal end thereof to
facilitate sealing engagement of the proximal end of outer jacket 72 within distal port 85 of
connection hub 80 via O-ring 76. That is, during assembly, ferrule 74 and, thus, the proximal
end of outer jacket 72, are inserted proximally into distal port 85 of connection hub 80
sufficiently such that ferrule 74 is sealingly engaged within connection hub 80 via O-ring 76.
Similarly as above, outer jacket and trocar assembly 70 may be engaged within connection hub
80 during manufacturing, or may be assembled by the user.
[0047]     Outer jacket and trocar assembly 70 further includes a trocar 90 defining a tapered
distal end that terminates at a pointed distal tip 92 to facilitate insertion of microwave antenna
probe 12 into tissue with minimal resistance, although other configurations may also be
provided. Trocar 90 may be formed from a variety of heat-resistant materials suitable for
penetrating tissue, e.g., metals (stainless steel, for example), various thermoplastic materials
(such as polytherimide, polyamide thermoplastic resins, etc.), or any other suitable material.
Base 94 of trocar 90 is sealingly engaged within open distal end 78 of outer jacket 72 via any
suitable process, e.g., using adhesives or via soldering. As such, trocar 90 sealingly encloses
antenna assembly 20 within outer jacket 72 and connection hub 80.
[0048]     Referring still to Figs. 1-5, connection hub 80, as mentioned above, defines a
longitudinal lumen 82 that is configured to receive feedline 30 therethrough, while sealingly
engaging outer jacket 72 within distal port 85 and transition 60 within proximal port 83.
Connection hub 80 further includes an inlet fluid port 87 and an outlet fluid port 89 that are
disposed in fluid communication with lumen 82. Inlet and outlet ports 87, 89 are configured to
receive tubes 17, 19 (see Fig. 1), respectively, such that coolant fluid from a coolant fluid supply
"FS" (Fig. 12) be circulated through connection hub 80 and outer jacket 72. More specifically,
an elastomeric (or otherwise configured) hub divider 81 a is sealingly engaged within lumen 82
of connection hub 80 to isolate the inlet and outlet portions of lumen 82 of connection hub 80
from one another. Further, an inflow tube 81b is coupled to hub divider 81a and extends distally
through outer jacket 72. As such, coolant fluid may flow from coolant fluid source "FS" (Fig.
12), through tube 17 and inlet port 87, into the inlet portion of lumen 82, and distally through
inflow tube 81b, ultimately returning proximally through outer jacket 72 (exteriorly of inflow
tube 81b), the outlet portion of lumen 82, outlet port 89, tube 19, and, ultimately, to coolant
fluid source "FS" (Fig. 12). This configuration allows for the circulation of coolant fluid about

                                                  10
antenna assembly 20 to maintain antenna assembly 20 in a relatively cooled state during use.
The coolant fluid may be a liquid, gas, other flowable material, or combination thereof.
[0049]    Various embodiments of microwave antenna probes configured to maintain the target
axial distance between the distal radiating portion and the trocar during use, thus facilitating
optimal performance of the probe, are described in detail hereinbelow. The microwave antenna
probes described below are similar to microwave antenna probe 12 (Figs. 1-7) and, thus, only
the differences therebetween will be described in detail, while similarities will only be
summarily described or omitted entirely.
[0050]    Referring to Figs. 8 an 9A-9B, another embodiment of a microwave antenna probe
provided in accordance with the present disclosure and configured to maintain the target axial
distance between the distal radiating portion and the trocar during use is shown generally
identified by reference numeral 112. Microwave antenna probe 112 generally includes a spacer
198 disposed on proximal surface 197 of trocar 190 between trocar 190 and distal radiating
portion 144. Spacer 198 may be formed from a substantially rigid material or, alternatively,
may be formed from a compressible material. In embodiments wherein spacer 198 is formed
from a substantially rigid material, spacer 198 is configured to define a thickness equal to the
target axial distance between proximal surface 197 of trocar 190 and the distal end of distal
radiating portion 144. In such embodiments, as will be described in greater detail below, distal
radiating portion 144 is maintained in contact with the proximal surface of spacer 198 such that
the target axial distance (equal to the thickness of spacer 198) is maintained between proximal
surface 197 of trocar 190 and the distal end of distal radiating portion 144. In embodiments
where spacer 198 is formed from a flexible or compressible material, spacer 198 is configured to
define a thickness that is equal to or greater than the target axial distance between proximal
surface 197 of trocar 190 and the distal end of distal radiating portion 144. Further, in such
embodiments, spacer 198 defines a pre-determined or known compressibility.
[0051]    Microwave antenna probe 112 further includes, as shown in Figs. 9A-9B, in
conjunction with Fig. 8, a flexible conductive joint 138 interconnecting distal radiating portion
144 and feedline 130 to electrically couple distal radiating portion 144 to the generator (not
shown), while also permitting distal radiating portion 144 to axially translate relative to the other
components of antenna assembly 120 and trocar 190 via the flexion of flexible conductive joint
138. Flexible conductive joint 138 is biased towards an extended position, e.g., the position

                                                    11
shown in Fig. 9A, wherein the distal portion of antenna assembly 120 defines a first length "L 1 ."
It is envisioned that first length "LI" is greater than the fully-assembled length of the distal
portion of antenna assembly 120 such, as will be described in greater detail below, flexible
conductive joint 138 is at least partially flexed in the fully assembled condition of microwave
antenna probe 112. Flexible conductive joint 138 is compressible from this initial, biased
position to shorten the length of the distal portion of antenna assembly 120, e.g., to a length
"L2," as shown in Fig. 9B. As a result of this configuration, distal radiating portion 144 defines
a "floating" configuration wherein distal radiating portion 144 may be axially displaced relative
to trocar 190 and the other components of antenna assembly 120 via flexion, e.g., compression,
of flexible conductive joint 138. Further, in embodiments where spacer 198 defines a
compressible configuration, it is envisioned that flexible conductive joint 138 define a known
compressibility, e.g., a compressibility equal to or proportional to that of spacer 198.
Additionally or alternatively, other flexible joints (not explicitly shown) may be disposed along
feedline 130 for similar purposes as flexible conductive joint 138.
[0052]    With continued reference to Figs. 8 and 9A-9B, in use, spacer 198 and the "floating"
distal radiating portion 144 cooperate to maintain the target axial distance between trocar 190
and distal radiating portion 144. More specifically, in use, the distal portion of antenna
assembly 120 initially defines a first length "Li." In embodiments where spacer 198 defines a
substantially rigid configuration having a thickness equal to the target axial distance, and upon
assembly of microwave antenna probe 112, the distal end of distal radiating portion 144 contacts
spacer 198, which urges distal radiating portion 144 proximally relative to trocar 190 and the
other components of antenna assembly 120, thus flexing flexible conductive joint 138 and
shortening the axial length of the distal portion of antenna assembly 120 to length "L 2 ." The
bias of flexible conductive joint 138 maintains distal radiating portion 144 in contact with spacer
198, thus maintain the target axial distance therebetween. The degree to which the axial length
of the distal portion of antenna assembly 120 is shortened, e.g., the degree to which flexible
conductive joint 138 is flexed or compressed, depends on the dimensions and configuration of
the components of microwave antenna probe 112, thus accounting for variation in the
components and engagements therebetween.
[0053]    With respect to embodiments where spacer 198 defines a compressible configuration,
upon assembly of microwave antenna probe 112, the distal end of distal radiating portion 144
contacts spacer 198 such that spacer 198 is at least partially compressed and distal radiating

                                                  12
portion 144 is at least partially moved proximally relative to trocar 190 and the other
components of antenna assembly 120, thus flexing flexible conductive joint 138 and shortening
the axial length of the distal portion of antenna assembly 120. In other words, in such
embodiments, rather than just flexible conductive joint 138 permitting distal radiating portion
144 to "float," thereby maintaining the target axial distance between trocar 190 and distal
radiating portion 144, compressible spacer 198 and flexible conductive joint 138 cooperate to
accounting for variation in the components of microwave antenna probe 112 and the
engagements therebetween, thus maintaining the target axial distance between trocar 190 and
distal radiating portion 144.
[0054]    Turning now to Fig. 10, another embodiment of a microwave antenna probe provided
in accordance with the present disclosure is shown generally identified by reference numeral
212. Microwave antenna probe 212 differs from microwave antenna probe 12 (Figs. 1-7) in that
transition 260 and/or ferrule 274 are sealingly engaged within connection hub 280 via flexible
couplings 269, 279, thus permitting at least some degree of axial translation of transition 260
and/or ferrule 274 relative to connection hub 280. Flexible couplings 269, 279 may include a
flexible sleeve of material disposed within proximal and distal ports 283, 285, respectively, of
connection hub 280 that are configured to receive transition 260 and ferrule 274, respectively, or
may define any other suitable configuration that permits axial movement of transition 260
and/or ferrule 274 relative to connection hub 280, while maintaining sealing engagement
therebetween.
[0055]    The above-described flexible couplings 269, 279, between connection hub 280 and
transition 260 and/or ferrule 274, respectively, allow for adjustment of the axial distance
between the distal end of distal radiating portion 244 (Fig. 11), which is ultimately coupled to
transition 260, and the proximal surface of trocar 290 (Fig. 11), which is ultimately coupled to
ferrule 274. As such, a target axial spacing between distal radiating portion 244 (Fig. 11) and
trocar 290 (Fig. 11) can be achieved by adjusting the relative position of transition 260 and/or
ferrule 274 relative to one another and to connection hub 280.
[0056]    Retaining members, e.g., clips "C1 ," "C2 ," O-rings, or other suitable retaining members,
may also be provided for engagement about connection hub 280 adjacent proximal and distal
ports 283, 285, respectively, to inhibit axial movement of transition 260 and/or ferrule 274
relative to one another and to connection hub 280 once the target axial spacing between distal

                                                  13
radiating portion 244 (Fig. 11) and trocar 290 (Fig. 11) has been achieved. More specifically,
clips "C1 ," "C2" sufficiently compress proximal and distal ports 283, 385 of connection hub 280
about transition 260 and ferrule 274, respectively, to retain connection hub 280, transition 260,
and ferrule 274 in substantially fixed position relative to one another.
[0057]     With reference now to Fig. 11, in conjunction with Fig. 10, antenna assembly 220 may
initially include a distal spacer 228 disposed about and extending distally from distal radiating
portion 244 of antenna assembly 220. Distal spacer 228 is configured to extend distally from
distal radiating portion 244 a distance equal to the target axial distance between distal radiating
portion 244 and trocar 290. Further, as will be described in greater detail below, distal spacer
228 may be formed from a dissolvable material.
[0058]     Antenna assembly 220, including distal spacer 228, is configured for use in conjunction
with the flexible couplings 269, 279 between connection hub 280 and transition 260 and/or
ferrule 274, respectively, to set and maintain the target axial distance between distal radiating
portion 244 and trocar 290. More specifically, upon assembly of microwave antenna probe 212,
the distal end distal spacer 228 eventually contacts the proximal surface of trocar 290, thereby
urging distal radiating portion 244 proximally and/or trocar 290 distally relative to one another.
The proximal urging of distal radiating portion 244 and/or the distal urging of trocar 290 is
permitted due to the flexible couplings 269, 279 between connection hub 280 and transition 260
and/or ferrule 274. In other words, upon contact of distal spacer 228 with trocar 290, transition
260 is urged proximally and/or ferrule 274 is urged distally relative to connection hub 280.
[0059]     With the components of microwave antenna probe 212 fully engaged to one another,
and with distal spacer 228 extending from distal radiating portion 244 into contact with trocar
290, the target axial distance between trocar 290 and distal radiating portion 244 is achieved,
e.g., since distal spacer 228 extends from distal radiating portion 224 the target axial distance.
In embodiments where distal spacer 228 is a permanent component, clips "C1 ," "C2 " are not
needed, as distal spacer 228 and the bias of flexible couplings 269, 279 maintains the target
axial distance between distal radiating portion 244 and trocar 290.
[0060]     With respect to other embodiments, once the above-mentioned position has been
achieved, clips "C1," "C 2 " may be engaged about proximal and distal ports 283, 285 of
connection hub 280 to retain connection hub 280, transition 260, and ferrule 274 in substantially

                                                  14
fixed position relative to one another, thus fixing trocar 290 and distal radiating portion 244 in
position defining the target axial distance therebetween. As such, once clips "C1 ," "C 2" are in
place, distal spacer 228 is no longer necessary to maintain the target axial distance between
trocar 290 and distal radiating portion 244. However, as distal spacer 228 is disposed within
microwave antenna probe 212, retrieval of distal spacer 228 may prove difficult. Instead, as
mentioned above, distal spacer 228 may be formed from a dissolvable materials such that, once
microwave antenna probe 212 is activated and coolant fluid is circulated therethrough into
contact distal spacer 228, distal spacer 228 is dissolved, and, thus, is carried out of microwave
antenna probe 212 along with the circulating coolant fluid. It is also envisioned that different
size spacers 228 be provided for use in accordance with any of the above-described
configurations, such that a particular spacer 228 may be selected to achieve a particular axial
distance between trocar 290 and distal radiating portion 244, depending on a particular purpose.
 [0061]   Turning now to Fig. 12, another embodiment of a microwave antenna probe provided
in accordance with the present disclosure is shown generally identified by reference numeral
312. Microwave antenna probe 312 is similar to microwave antenna probe 212 (Fig. 10), and
includes flexible couplings 369, 379 between connection hub 380 and transition 360 and/or
ferrule 374, respectively, that allow for adjustment of the axial distance between the distal end
of distal radiating portion 344, which is ultimately coupled to transition 360, and the proximal
surface of trocar 390, which is ultimately coupled to ferrule 374. Further, the flexible couplings
369, 379 may bias transition 360 and/or ferrule 374 towards a closer-together position, e.g.,
towards one another. Flexible couplings 369, 379, as mentioned above, allow a target axial
spacing between distal radiating portion 344 and trocar 390 to be achieved by adjusting the
relative position of transition 360 and/or ferrule 374 relative to one another and to connection
hub 380. More specifically, as will be described in greater detail hereinbelow, the relative
positions of transition 360 and/or ferrule 374 with respect to each other and connection hub 380
are maintained by sustaining a pre-determined pressure, as applied by coolant fluid, within outer
jacket 372 and connection hub 380.
 [0062]   Continuing with reference to Fig. 12, due to the flexible coupling between connection
hub 380 and transition 360 and/or ferrule 374, the relative positioning of transition 360 and/or
ferrule 374 may be altered by controlling the pressure within connection hub 380, as established
by the circulation of coolant fluid flowing through lumen 382 of connection hub 380 and
through outer jacket 372. That is, where a relatively greater pressure of coolant fluid is applied,

                                                   15
a relatively greater outward force is exerted on transition 360 and ferrule 374 such that transition
360 and ferrule 374 are urged relatively further apart from one another. As a result, the axial
distance between trocar 390 and distal radiating portion 344 is relatively greater. On the other
hand, where a relatively smaller pressure is applied, a relatively smaller outward force is exerted
on transition 360 and ferrule 374 such that transition 360 and ferrule 374 are urged apart a
relatively smaller distance (or not at all). In this case, the axial distance between trocar 390 and
distal radiating portion 344 is relatively small. In other words, a desired axial spacing between
distal radiating portion 344 and trocar 390 may be achieved by establishing a pre-determined
pressure within connection hub 380. The particular relationship between the applied pressure
and the axial distance may depend on the particular configuration of microwave antenna probe
312, and may be determined experimentally, empirically, or in any other suitable fashion.
 [0063]   In use, when microwave antenna probe 312 is activated, coolant fluid is pumped from
 fluid source "FS" through tube 317 and into inlet fluid port 387 of connection hub 380 such that
the coolant fluid may circulate through lumen 382 of connection hub 380 and through outer
jacket 372 to maintain microwave antenna probe 312 in a relatively cooled state during use.
Ultimately, the fluid is pumped out of connection hub 380 through outlet fluid port 389, and
returns to the fluid source "FS" via tube 319. A pressure sensor "PS" extending into lumen 382
of connection hub 380 and coupled to the fluid source "FS" may also be provided for
monitoring the pressure within connection hub 380, although the pressure sensor "PS" may
alternatively be independent of the fluid source "FS." The pressure sensor "PS" provides
 feedback to the fluid source "FS" such that the necessary pressure to maintain transition 360 and
ferrule 374 in proper position relative to one another and, thus, to maintain the target axial
distance between trocar 390 and distal radiating portion 344 can be readily achieved and
maintained.
 [0064]   With reference now to Fig. 13A-13B, another embodiment of a microwave antenna
probe 412 provided in accordance with the present disclosure is shown including a spacer, or
expandable member 498 disposed within outer jacket 472 and positioned on the proximal
surface of trocar 490. Spacer, or expandable member 498 may be configured to expand upon
contact within coolant fluid, upon heating, or in any suitable manner such that expandable
member 498 is expanded from a first, compressed position, as shown in Fig. 13A, to a second,
expanded position, as shown in Fig. 13B, when use of microwave antenna probe 412 is initiated.
In the expanded position, expandable member 498 is configured to define a thickness equal to

                                                   16
the target axial distance between trocar 490 and distal radiating portion 444 and is further
configured to urge distal radiating portion 444 proximally relative to trocar 490 upon expansion.
As such, in the expanded position of expandable member 498, and, thus, during use of
microwave antenna probe 412, the target axial distance between trocar 490 and distal radiating
portion 444 is achieved. Expandable member 498 may be used in conjunction with flexible
conductive joint 138 (see Figs. 9A-9B), flexible couplings 269, 279 (Fig. 10), or any other
suitable mechanism configured to permit axial movement of distal radiating section 444 relative
to trocar 490, e.g., via permitting axial movement of the transition relative to the ferrule, such
that, upon urging by expandable member 498 as a result of expansion of expandable member
498, the target axial distance between distal radiating portion 444 and trocar 490 is achieved and
maintained throughout use.
[0065]    Turning now to Fig. 14, another embodiment of a microwave antenna probe provided
in accordance with the present disclosure and configured to maintain the target axial distance
between the distal radiating portion and the trocar during use is shown generally identified by
reference numeral 512. Microwave antenna probe 512 is similar to microwave antenna probe 12
(Figs. 1-7), except that, rather than providing for circulation of coolant fluid through outer jacket
572, antenna assembly 520 is substantially surrounded by a phase-change material 598 initially
disposed in a solid state. More specifically, phase-change material 598 is disposed about
antenna assembly 520 such that phase-change material 598 extends distally from distal radiating
portion 544 a distance equal to the target axial distance between trocar 590 and distal radiating
portion 544. Accordingly, during assembly, antenna assembly 520 is inserted into outer jacket
572 (or outer jacket 572 is disposed about antenna assembly 520) such that the distal end of
phase-change material 598 abuts the proximal surface of trocar 590, thereby establishing the
target axial distance between trocar 590 and distal radiating portion 544. With this target
spacing achieved, the remaining components of microwave antenna probe 512 may be fixedly
engaged to one another.
[0066]    With continued reference to Fig. 14, in use, when microwave antenna probe 512 is
activated to apply energy to tissue to treat, e.g., ablate, tissue, antenna assembly 520 is heated.
As a result, phase-change material 598 is likewise heated. Upon sufficient heating of phase
change material 598, phase-change material 598 is transformed from its initial solid state to a
fluid, e.g., liquid, state, whereby heat is absorbed by phase-change material 598. The absorption
of heat by the phase-change material 598 helps maintain microwave antenna probe 512 in a

                                                   17
relatively cooled state during use. Further, since the components of microwave antenna probe
512 are already assembled and fixedly engaged to one another at this point, the transformation
of phase-change material 598 from the solid state to the fluid, e.g., liquid, state does not alter the
axial distance between distal radiating potion 544 and trocar 590. Phase-change material 598
may be disposed within a compartmentalized jacket (not explicitly shown) that includes a
plurality of pockets, each retaining a portion of phase-change material 598, or may be provided
in any other suitable configuration.
[0067]     With reference now to Fig. 15, another embodiment of a microwave antenna probe
provided in accordance with the present disclosure for achieving a target axial distance between
the distal radiating portion and the trocar during use is shown generally identified by reference
numeral 612. Microwave antenna probe 612 is similar to microwave antenna probe 12 (Figs. 1
7) except that outer jacket and trocar assembly 670 is axially extendable and retractable relative
to antenna assembly 620 to vary the axial distance between distal radiating portion 644 and
trocar 690.
[0068]     Continuing with reference to Fig. 15, ferrule 674 of outer jacket and trocar assembly
670 is rotatably mounted relative to distal port 685 of connection hub 680 such that ferrule 674
may be rotated relative to outer jacket and trocar assembly 670 to extend or retract trocar 690
relative to distal radiating portion 644, while mainlining the sealing engagement between ferrule
674 and connection hub 680 via O-ring 676. More specifically, ferrule 674 includes a base 675a
that is configured for insertion into distal port 685 of connection hub 680 for sealing
engagement therein via O-ring 676, while annular flange 675b of ferrule 674 is configured for
positioning about distal port 685 of connection hub 680 in threading engagement therewith.
That is, annular flange 675b of ferrule 674 defines threading 677 on the internal surface thereof
that is pitched relative to and configured to engage complementary threading 681 disposed on
the outer surface of connection hub 680 adjacent distal port 685. Due to the relative pitch
between threadings 677, 681, rotation of ferrule 674 relative to connection hub 680 effects axial
translation of ferrule 674 relative to connection hub 680. As such, by rotating ferrule 674
relative to connection hub 680, the relative spacing between trocar 690 and distal radiating
portion 644 can be varied such that a target axial distance therebetween can be achieved. Visual
markings or indicia (not explicitly shown) may also be provided to allow the user to ascertain
the relative position of outer jacket and trocar assembly 670. Further, a locking mechanism (not

                                                  18
shown) may be provided to lock outer jacket and trocar assembly 670 in position once the target
axial spacing between trocar 690 and distal radiating portion 644 has been achieved.
[0069]    From the foregoing and with reference to the various figure drawings, those skilled in
the art will appreciate that certain modifications can also be made to the present disclosure
without departing from the scope of the same. While several embodiments of the disclosure
have been shown in the drawings, it is not intended that the disclosure be limited thereto, as it is
intended that the disclosure be as broad in scope as the art will allow and that the specification
be read likewise. Therefore, the above description should not be construed as limiting, but
merely as exemplifications of particular embodiments. Those skilled in the art will envision
other modifications within the scope and spirit of the claims appended hereto.
