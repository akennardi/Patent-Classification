  CAPACITIVE SENSING OF A MOVING-COIL STRUCTURE WITH AN INSET

                                          FIELD
[0001]      This application relates generally to a speaker with an acoustic radiator
having an inset plate for capacitive displacement sensing of a moving-coil structure,
more specifically, to a speaker having an acoustic radiator made of a flexible circuit
which includes an inset plate for capacitive displacement sensing and that is
electrically connected to the speaker components. Other embodiments are also
described and claimed.
                                     BACKGROUND
[0002]      In modern consumer electronics, audio capability is playing an
increasingly larger role as improvements in digital audio signal processing and audio
content delivery continue to happen. In this aspect, there is a wide range of
consumer electronics devices that can benefit from improved audio performance.
For instance, smart phones include, for example, electro-acoustic transducers such as
speakerphone loudspeakers and earpiece receivers that can benefit from improved
audio performance. Smart phones, however, do not have sufficient space to house
much larger high fidelity sound output devices. This is also true for some portable
personal computers such as laptop, notebook, and tablet computers, and, to a lesser
extent, desktop personal computers with built-in speakers. Many of these devices
use what are commonly referred to as "micro-speakers." Micro-speakers are a
miniaturized version of a loudspeaker, which use a moving coil motor to drive
sound output. The moving coil motor may include a diaphragm, voice coil and
magnet assembly positioned within a frame. The input of an electrical audio signal
to the moving coil motor causes the diaphragm to vibrate and output sound.
Electrical connections to the voice coil for transmitting electrical signals (or any other
associated moving components) typically consist of wires running from the voice coil
to other stationary components. The wires may flex as the radiator vibrates, which in
turn, can lead to wire breakage and reliability issues in the field.

                                                                            Electronically Filed
                                        SUMMARY
[0003]     This disclosure is directed to a transducer, for example a moving-coil
speaker (e.g., a micro-speaker) that is water resistant, has high acoustic sensitivity,
low tactility and incorporates a capacitive sensing element used for displacement
detection of the acoustic radiator within the transducer. More specifically, some
features of the speaker include an acoustic radiator or sound radiating surface (SRS)
made from a flexible circuit (also commonly referred to as a flexible printed circuit
board) with an over molded surround. The flexible circuit (or SRS) may, in turn, be
directly connected to, and be used to connect the voice coil to, external wiring (e.g.,
wiring external to the flexible circuit) and electronic components within the speaker.
For example, the flexible circuit, which forms the SRS), may be connected to an
integrated circuit by the external wiring for capacitive displacement sensing. An
advantage of using the flexible circuit (e.g., via circuitry therein) to provide electrical
connections to the SRS (such as for and between the voice coil and wiring to external
components, as opposed to the voice coil wiring itself extending directly to external
components, is that the voice coil and the external wiring can be made of different
materials that can improve an overall performance and reliability of the transducer.
For example, the voice coil may be made of a relatively low-tensile strength and low
mass material such as a copper-clad aluminum coil so that an overall mass of the
voice coil is reduced. The external wiring, on the other hand, may be made of
another type of wire material, for example, a higher-tensile strength material, such as
a silver-copper alloy, that will not mechanically fatigue as it moves with respect to
the SRS. In addition, the flexible circuit may be formed (e.g., thermoformed) to have
a geometry that increases a stiffness of the radiator (and improves acoustic high
frequency performance of the speaker). In addition, to accommodate the moving
assembly, a specially designed magnetic circuit is used which can accommodate the
shape of the acoustic radiator and welded wires with minimal impact in motor
strength.
[0004]     More specifically, one embodiment is directed to a speaker assembly (e.g.,
a micro-speaker assembly) including a sound radiating surface suspended over a
magnet assembly, a suspension member for suspending the sound radiating surface

                                                                            Electronically Filed
over the magnet assembly, a voice coil extending from a bottom side of the sound
radiating surface, and a capacitive displacement sensor for sensing a movement of
the sound radiating surface. The capacitive displacement sensor may include a first
conductive plate fixedly positioned over the sound radiating surface and a second
conductive plate coupled to the sound radiating surface and vertically aligned with
the first conductive plate. The second conductive plate may be confined to an area
that is entirely radially inward of the voice coil. In some embodiments, the sound
radiating surface includes a flexible printed circuit board and the second conductive
plate is formed within a portion of the flexible printed circuit board entirely radially
inward of the voice coil. For example, the sound radiating surface may include a
plurality of material layers and the second conductive plate is formed by at least one
of the plurality of material layers. The second conductive plate may be radially
inward of the voice coil a distance sufficient to reduce a parasitic capacitance
between the second conductive plate and the voice coil. For example, the second
conductive plate may be radially inward of the voice coil a distance of at least 0.1
millimeters.    In other embodiments, a surface area of the second conductive plate
may be less than a surface area of the sound radiating surface radially inward of an
inner surface of the voice coil. In addition, the sound radiating surface may include
an out-of-plane region radially inward to the voice coil, and the second conductive
plate may be confined to an area of the out-of-plane region. The speaker assembly
may further include an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) electrically
coupled to the second conductive plate for capacitive displacement sensing, and a
wire for electrically connecting the second conductive plate to the ASIC.
[0005]      In still further embodiments, the invention is directed to a speaker
assembly including a frame having a first frame member and a second frame
member between which a cavity is formed. The first frame member may be in a
fixed position with respect to the second frame member and include a first electrode.
A sound radiating surface may be suspended over a magnet assembly within the
cavity by a suspension member and the sound radiating surface operable to move in
response to an acoustic input and have a second electrode formed therein. A voice
coil may extend from a bottom face of the sound radiating surface and the second
electrode may be confined to an area of the sound radiating surface that is radially
inward to an inner surface of the voice coil. Finally, a circuit for detecting a

displacement of the sound radiating surface based on a change in capacitance
between the first electrode and the second electrode may be provided. The first
electrode and the second electrode may be vertically aligned with one another. In
addition, the first electrode may be positioned along a side of the sound radiating
surface opposite the magnet assembly. The sound radiating surface may include a
flexible printed circuit board and the second electrode may be embedded within the
flexible printed circuit board. For example, the second electrode may be a copper
plate embedded within the flexible printed circuit board. The second electrode may
be radially inward of the voice coil a distance of from 0.1 millimeters to 1.0
millimeters. In other embodiments, the second electrode may be radially inward of
the voice coil a distance sufficient to reduce a parasitic capacitance between the
second electrode and the voice coil. The sound radiating surface may include an out
of-plane region, and the second electrode may be confined to an area of the out-of
plane region. The second electrode may include a same profile as the out-of-plane
region of the sound radiating surface. The assembly may further included a wire for
electrically coupling the second electrode to the circuit and the circuit may be an
application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC).

present invention. It is contemplated that the invention includes all systems and

summarized above, as well as those disclosed in the Detailed Description below and

                                                                               Electronically Filed
                                  DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0020]       In this section we shall explain several preferred embodiments of this
invention with reference to the appended drawings. Whenever the shapes, relative
positions and other aspects of the parts described in the embodiments are not clearly
defined, the scope of the invention is not limited only to the parts shown, which are
meant merely for the purpose of illustration. Also, while numerous details are set
forth, it is understood that some embodiments of the invention may be practiced
without these details. In other instances, well-known structures and techniques have
not been shown in detail so as not to obscure the understanding of this description.
The terms "over", "to", and "on" as used herein may refer to a relative position of
one feature with respect to other features. One feature "over" or "on" another
feature or bonded "to" another feature may be directly in contact with the other
feature or may have one or more intervening layers. In addition, the use of relative
terms throughout the description, such as "top", "above or "upper" and "bottom",
"under" or "lower" may denote a relative position or direction. For example, a "top
edge", "top end" or "top side" may be directed in a first axial direction and a
"bottom edge", "bottom end" or "bottom side" may be directed in a second direction
opposite to the first axial direction.
[0021]       Fig. 1 illustrates a cross-sectional side view of one embodiment of a
transducer. Transducer 100 may be, for example, an electro-acoustic transducer that
converts electrical signals into audible signals that can be output from a device
within which transducer 100 is integrated. For example, transducer 100 may be a
micro-speaker such as a speakerphone speaker or an earpiece receiver found within a
smart phone, or other similar compact electronic device such as a laptop, notebook,
tablet computer or portable time piece. Transducer 100 may be enclosed within a
housing or enclosure of the device within which it is integrated. In some
embodiments, transducer 100 may be a 10 mm to 75 mm driver, or 10 mm to 20 mm
driver (as measured along the diameter or longest length dimension), for example, a
micro-speaker.
[0022]       Transducer 100 may include a housing or frame 116, which encloses all of
the components of transducer 100. Frame 116 may, in some cases, include a top
                                                 6

                                                      Attorney Docket No.: 004860.P32971PCT
                                                                           Electronically Filed
frame member 116B and a bottom frame member 116A, between which a cavity for
holding transducer components is formed. The top frame member 116B and the
bottom frame member 116A may be welded together along their interfacing surfaces.
[0023]     Transducer 100 may further include a sound radiating surface (SRS) 102.
The SRS 102 may also be referred to herein as an acoustic radiator, a sound radiator
or a diaphragm. SRS 102 may be any type of flexible membrane (which may include
a number of material layers) capable of vibrating in response to an acoustic signal to
produce acoustic or sound waves. In this aspect, SRS 102 may include a top face 106,
which generates sound to be output to a user, and a bottom face 108, which is
acoustically isolated from the top face 106, so that any acoustic or sound waves
generated by the bottom face 108 do not interfere with those from the top face 106.
[0024]     SRS 102 may have an out-of-plane region 110, for example, a concave dome
or convex dome or other shaped region. In other words, the out-of-plane region 110
includes at least a portion which is in a different plane (e.g., a plane above or below)
than the rest of SRS 102. The out-of-plane region 110 may be within a center of the
SRS 102 and be curved, or otherwise bow out, in a direction of the underlying
magnet assembly 112. The specific shape of the out-of-plane region 110 may be any
shape that geometrically stiffens SRS 102 and improves a sound output from the SRS
102. For example, the out-of-plane region may be dimensioned to stiffen the SRS 102
and improve acoustic high-frequency performance of transducer 100. Still further,
the out-of-plane region 110 may be dimensioned to stiffen the SRS 102 such that a
breaking mode frequency of the SRS 102 is above a working range of transducer 100.
For example, out-of-plane region 110 may be a dome shaped region that bows out in
a downward direction (e.g., toward magnet assembly 112). Alternatively, out-of
plane region 110 may be a dome shaped region that bows out in an upward direction
(e.g., toward top frame member 116B). The dome shaped region may, in some
embodiments, include a flattened region (e.g., a disk shaped region) at its outermost
portion, or be entirely curved. In addition, SRS 102 may include a stiffening material
to materially stiffen SRS 102 in a manner that improves sound output, as will be
discussed in more detail in reference to Figs. 5A-5B.

                                                        Attorney Docket No.: 004860.P32971PCT
                                                                             Electronically Filed
[0025]      In addition, SRS 102 may include conductive layers, tracks, traces, pads or
other features so that, for example, electrical connections with other transducer
components can be made through SRS 102. Representatively, in one embodiment,
SRS 102 may include a number of material layers, at least one of which is a
conductive layer. For example, SRS 102 may be made from a flexible circuit, having a
number of preformed material layers, and thermoformed to have the desired SRS
shape and size. For example, the flexible circuit may be heated, formed to the
desired shape (e.g., a dome shape) using a mold and then cooled such that it retains
the molded shape. The flexible circuit, or flex circuit or flexible printed circuit board
(FPCB) as it is also commonly referred to, may be any flexible circuit having a
number of material layers and circuitry formed within a flexible substrate whose
shape may be changed upon application of an external force. This is in contrast to a
"rigid" printed circuit board having two-dimensional and /or three-dimensional
stability allowing no deformation, bending or an otherwise change in shape or
profile of the structure upon application of an external force. It is further
contemplated that in other embodiments, SRS 102 may, instead of being formed from
a flexible circuit, be a diaphragm membrane formed from a material or layers of
material (e.g., a polyester such as polyethylene naphthalate (PEN) or polyimide (PI)
or polyethylene terephthalate (PET)) and having a flexible circuit mounted to an
outer surface of the membrane. It should further be understood that any reference to
a flexible circuit, flex circuit or FPCB herein is intended to include flexible circuits
made by any technique, for example printing or any other techniques suitable for
forming a flexible circuit which do not include a printing process. Further details
regarding SRS 102 and the various material layers will be described in more detail in
reference to Fig. 5A-Fig. 5B.
[0026]      Transducer 100 may also include a voice coil 114 positioned along a bottom
face 108 of SRS 102 (e.g., a face of SRS 102 facing magnet assembly 112). For example,
in one embodiment, voice coil 114 includes an upper end 124 and a lower end 126.
The upper end 124 may be directly attached to the bottom face 108 of SRS 102, such
as by chemical bonding or the like. In another embodiment, voice coil 114 may be
formed by a wire wrapped around a former or bobbin and the former or bobbin is
directly attached to the bottom face 108 of SRS 102. In one embodiment, voice coil
114 may have a similar profile and shape to that of SRS 102. For example, where SRS
                                              8

                                                       Attorney Docket No.: 004860.P32971PCT
                                                                            Electronically Filed
102 has a square, rectangular, circular or elliptical shape, voice coil 114 may also have
a similar shape. For example, voice coil 114 may have a substantially rectangular,
square, circular or racetrack shape. In addition, voice coil 114 may be made of a
relatively low tension wire material (e.g., copper clad aluminum) which is electrically
connected to a conductive layer or trace within SRS 102, and the conductive layer or
trace electrically connected to external wiring and components, as will be discussed
in more detail in reference to Fig. 3-Fig. 4.
[0027]     SRS 102, with voice coil 114 attached thereto, may be suspended within
frame 116 by a suspension member 118, also referred to herein as a suspension or
surround. For example, the suspension member 118 may have an inner edge 128 that
is molded along an outer edge 130 of SRS 102. In addition, suspension member 118
may be over molded to the bottom frame member 116A along its outer edge 132.
Alternatively, or in addition, the suspension member 118 may also be over molded to
the top frame member 116B, or both the top and bottom frame members 116A, 116B
along the outer edge 132. The suspension member 118 may be considered "molded"
or "over molded" to the SRS 102 and /or the frame 116 in that suspension member
118 is formed (such as from liquid silicone) and chemically bonded to a surface of
SRS 102 and /or frame 116 during an over molding process, for example, an injection
molding process. In this aspect, a separate adhesive or bonding layer is not required
to attach suspension member 118 to SRS 102 and/or frame 116. In addition, molding
suspension member 118 to SRS 102 and frame 116 creates an air-tight and water-tight
seal between SRS 102 and frame 116. This seal prevents acoustic cancellation and
water ingress beyond (e.g., below) SRS 102 and therefore prevents any water, which
may unintentionally enter transducer 100, from damaging the various electronic
components and circuitry associated with transducer 100 (e.g., voice coil 114). In this
aspect, transducer 100 has some tolerance to water and / or may be considered water
resistant in that water will not disable the transducer 100. In one embodiment, the
suspension member 118 may have what is considered a "rolled" configuration in that
it has a concave or curved region between the inner edge 128 and outer edge 132
which allows for greater compliance in the z-direction (e.g., a direction perpendicular
to the suspension member plane), and in turn, facilitates an up and down movement,
also referred to as a vibration, of the SRS 102. The curved region may curve or bow
in a direction of the magnet assembly 112. It should further be noted that although
                                              9

                                                        Attorney Docket No.: 004860.P32971PCT
                                                                             Electronically Filed
an over molded suspension member 118 is described, in other embodiments, where
molding is not used, an adhesive or other bonding agent could be used to secure
suspension member 118 to SRS 102 and/or frame 116.
[0028]      Transducer 100 may further include a magnet assembly 112. Magnet
assembly 112 may include a magnet 134 (e.g., a NdFeB magnet), with a top plate 136
and a yoke 138 for guiding a magnetic circuit generated by magnet 134. Magnet
assembly 112, including magnet 134, top plate 136 and yoke 138, may be positioned
below SRS 102, for example, between SRS 102 and bottom frame member 116A. For
example, a bottom side 140 of magnet assembly 112 may be mounted to, or otherwise
rest on such that it is in direct contact with, a top side 142 of bottom frame member
116A. A one-magnet embodiment is shown here, although multi-magnet motors are
also contemplated.
[0029]      In one embodiment, magnet 134 may be a center magnet positioned
entirely within an open center of voice coil 114. In this aspect, magnet 134 may have
a similar profile as voice coil 114, for example, a square, a rectangular, a circular, or
elliptical shape. Top plate 136 may be specially designed to accommodate an out-of
plane region 110 (e.g., a concave or dome shaped region) of SRS 102. For example,
top plate 136 may have a cut-out or opening 144 within its center that is aligned with
the out-of-plane region 110 of SRS 102. In this aspect, the additional space created
below the out-of-plane region 110 allows SRS 102 to move or vibrate up and down
(e.g., pistonically) without contacting top plate 136. In this aspect, the opening 144
may have a similar size or area as the out-of-plane region 110. Yoke 138 may have a
substantially "U" shaped profile such that its sidewalls 146, 148 form the gap with
magnet 134, within which voice coil 114 is positioned.
[0030]      Transducer 100 may further include a capacitive displacement sensor for
sensing a displacement (e.g., vibration) of SRS 102. Representatively, in one
embodiment, a top or first electrode 150 may be positioned along a side of the top
frame member 116B facing SRS 102. The first electrode 150 may be positioned such
that, in the vertical alignment, it overlaps with SRS 102. A second electrode 152 may
be associated with SRS 102. For example, in one embodiment, the second electrode
152 is formed by a conductive layer or plate within the SRS 102 (e.g., within the
                                              10

                                                        Attorney Docket No.: 004860.P32971PCT
                                                                             Electronically Filed
flexible circuit). In other embodiments, the second electrode 152 may be a separate
component that is attached to a surface of SRS 102, such as by an adhesive or
chemical bonding. The second electrode 152 may be of a sufficient size and shape
suitable for capacitive displacement sensing while reducing, or otherwise
eliminating, any instances of parasitic capacitance that may occur due to electrode
152 and voice coil 114 being in close proximity to one another. For example, second
electrode 152 may, in some embodiments, be confined to an area within a boundary,
footprint or entirely inward of voice coil 114, and in some cases an area of out-of
plane region 110, so that electrode 152 and voice coil 114 do not overlap (in the
vertical direction). The first electrode 150 is in a fixed position while the second
electrode 152 moves with SRS 102. The electrodes 150, 152 may either be flat or
formed with out-of-plane features. Therefore, during operation, the movement of
SRS 102 creates a change in the amount of capacitance between the first electrode 150
and the second electrode 152. This change in capacitance is sensed and translated
into an electrical signal by, for example, an application-specific integrated circuit
(ASIC) 156 electrically connected to the electrodes, for example, through a terminal
154 on frame 116 or elsewhere on transducer 100. Further details regarding the
capacitive displacement sensor and its associated components will be described in
reference to Fig. 2-Fig. 3.
[0031]      Fig. 2 illustrates a bottom plan view of the transducer of Fig. 1 with the
voice coil and magnet assembly omitted. From this view, it can be seen that SRS 102,
which may be formed from a flexible circuit including traces or circuitry, may also
include a conductive layer or plate 202 (as shown by dashed lines). The conductive
layer or plate 202 may, for example, serve as the second electrode 152 formed within
SRS 102 for capacitive sensing, as previously discussed in reference to Fig. 1.
[0032]      Contact regions 204, 206 and 208 may further be formed, for example,
within SRS 102 and exposed through the bottom side of SRS 102 to facilitate electrical
connections with the circuitry and /or conductive plate 202 within SRS 102 (e.g.,
within the flexible circuit used to form SRS 102). For example, contact regions 204
and 206 may be contact pads (e.g., metal pads), which contact circuitry within SRS
102 and therefore can be used to electrically connect external wires 210, 212,
respectively, to the circuitry or other external components electrically connected to
                                             11

                                                       Attorney Docket No.: 004860.P32971PCT
                                                                            Electronically Filed
contact regions 204 and 206 (e.g., to drive current through the voice coil 114 to
operate the transducer 100). Alternatively, or in addition, contact regions 204, 206
and/or 208 may have openings within a layer of SRS 102, which expose the
underlying conductive regions (e.g., plate 202 in the case of region 208) so that
external wiring (e.g., wire 214) can be connected to them. In one embodiment,
external wire 214 may be electrically connected to conductive plate 202 at contact
region 208, for example, to facilitate capacitive displacement sensing as previously
discussed. Representatively, external wires 210, 212 and 214 may be welded to
contact regions 204, 206, 208, respectively, after the suspension member 118 is over
molded to SRS 102. Each of external wires 210, 212, 214 may be high-tensile strength
wires that will not mechanically fatigue with the movement of SRS 102. For example,
wires 210, 212 and 214 may be silver copper alloy wires that have extra high-tension
strength so that they will not break upon repeated movement of SRS 102. Likewise,
tinsel wire may be used. Each of external wires 210, 212, 214 may further be
electrically connected to external components such as an ASIC, or other electronic
component associated with transducer 100, for example, by connecting them to the
terminal 154 (or other terminals not shown) on frame 116 as previously discussed.
For clarity, the three wires 210, 212, 214 are shown with a simple routing pattern.
[0033]      Fig. 3 illustrates a bottom plan view of the transducer of Fig. 2 with the
voice coil included. From this view, it can be seen that once external wires 210, 212
and 214 are connected to contact regions 204, 206 and 208, respectively, voice coil 114
is positioned over the external wires 210, 212 and 214 and attached (e.g., glued) to the
bottom face 108 of SRS 102. In other words, wires 210, 212 and 214 are sandwiched
between SRS 102 and voice coil 114. It should be noted that if voice coil 114 is
positioned around a bobbin, the bobbin may be attached to the bottom face 108 of
SRS 102, instead of to the voice coil directly. The voice coil lead wires 302 and 304
are then welded to contact regions 204 and 206, respectively. In some embodiments,
a surface finishing step is performed to facilitate attachment of lead wires 302, 304 to
contact regions 204, 206, respectively. For example, a tin plating is applied to the
contact regions 204, 206 (e.g., contact region pads) before welding on wires 302, 304.
[0034]      As previously discussed, voice coil lead wire 302 and external wire 210 are
electrically connected at contact region 204, and contact region 204 may provide an
                                             12

                                                         Attorney Docket No.: 004860.P32971PCT
                                                                              Electronically Filed
electrical connection to SRS 102 (e.g., via a pad connected to a conductive layer such
as traces or circuitry within a flexible circuit used to form SRS 102). Therefore, SRS
102 (e.g., via circuitry or traces with the flexible circuit) may be used to provide an
electrical connection between voice coil 114 and external wire 210. Similarly, voice
coil lead wire 304 and external wire 212 are electrically connected at contact region
206, and contact region 206 may provide an electrical connection to SRS 102 (e.g., via
a pad connected to circuitry or traces within the flexible circuit used to form SRS
102). Therefore, SRS 102 (via the flexible circuit) may be used to provide an electrical
connection between voice coil 114 and external wire 212. In other words, in one
embodiment, the voice coil current is conducted by a conductive trace or layer of the
flex circuit that constitutes the SRS 102. The SRS 102 formed from the flexible circuit
as previously discussed therefore provides an advantage over an SRS not formed
from a flexible circuit in that it can be used to electrically connect the voice coil 114 to
external wires at contact regions, or route electrical connections between contact
regions for the voice coil 114 and contact regions for the external wires, as shown in
Fig. 4. The external wires 210, 212, in turn, may be used to electrically connect the
voice coil lead wires 302, 304 to other circuitry or other electronic components
associated with transducer 100 to help drive operation of the transducer 100.
[0035]      In addition, it should be understood that because the voice coil lead wires
302, 304 are welded directly to the SRS 102 and then wires 210, 212 are used to
electrically connect voice coil lead wires 302, 304 to, for example, another stationary
member, there is minimal flexing of lead wires 302, 304 when the SRS 102 moves. As
a result, the wire forming voice coil 114 can be made of a lower tension or tensile
strength material with less mass than that of wires 210, 212. This, in turn, reduces an
overall mass of the SRS 102/voice coil 114 assembly. Reducing the mass of the SRS
102 / voice coil 114 assembly may improve acoustic sensitivity and / or reduce
unwanted transmitted forces (e.g., a user feeling the vibration of the SRS 102), which
may occur in high powered transducers. For example, voice coil 114 can be made
from a copper clad aluminum (CCA, 15-40% ratio) wire which reduces the mass of
voice coil 114 and in turn the output of unwanted vibrational forces from transducer
100. Wires 210, 212, on the other hand, can be made of a higher tension or tensile
strength material, for example, silver-copper alloy, as previously discussed. It
should further be noted that external wire 214 may also be made of a similarly high
                                              13

                                                       Attorney Docket No.: 004860.P32971PCT
                                                                            Electronically Filed
tensile-strength material as wires 210, 212. It should further be understood that
using a higher-tensile strength material for external wires 210, 212 and 214 (in
comparison to that of voice coil 114) improves the reliability of the transducer 100 as
previously discussed, while still achieving a low mass SRS 102/voice coil 114
assembly.
[0036]      Moreover, as can be seen from Fig. 3, conductive plate 202, which is
electrically connected to external wire 214 at contact region 208, is confined to an area
within a boundary, footprint, or otherwise considered entirely inward, of an inner
surface 306 of voice coil 114 so that conductive plate 202 (e.g., electrode 152) and
voice coil 114 do not overlap. Said another way, a surface area or spread of
conductive plate 202 may be less than a surface area or spread of the area of SRS 102
radially inward to the inner surface 306 of voice coil 114. In other words, conductive
plate 202 may be inset with respect to voice coil 114 by a distance (d) which reduces,
or otherwise prevents, a possible parasitic capacitance between voice coil 114 and
conductive plate 202, which could interfere with, or otherwise prevent, accurate
capacitive sensing using conductive plate 202 and another electrode (e.g., first
electrode 150 described in reference to Fig. 1). For example, in some embodiments,
the inset distance (d) may be from about 0.1 mm to about 1 mm, or from about 0.1
mm to about 0.5 mm, or from about 0.2 mm to about 0.3 mm. In still further
embodiments, conductive plate 202 may be confined to an area of the out-of-plane
region 110 of SRS 102, as shown in Fig. 1. In this aspect, conductive plate 202 may
have a similar shape and /or profile to that of out-of-plane region 110, for example, a
square, circular, or rectangular profile, or a substantially flat, bowed or curved
configuration.
[0037]      In addition, although not shown, external wire 214 may be electrically
connected to an ASIC (e.g., ASIC 156 previously discussed in reference to Fig. 1) for
processing, filtering, or the like, of a signal from conductive plate 202 for measuring
of the displacement of SRS 102. For example, during operation, the movement of
SRS 102 having conductive plate 202 therein (e.g., second electrode 152 as discussed
in reference to Fig. 1) creates a change in the amount of capacitance between the
conductive plate 202 and a fixed plate (e.g., the second electrode 152 attached to the
frame as discussed in reference to Fig. 1). This change in capacitance is sensed and
                                              14

                                                                             Electronically Filed
translated into an electrical signal by, for example, an ASIC for measuring of the SRS
displacement.
[0038]      Fig. 4 illustrates a bottom plan view of another embodiment of the
transducer of Fig. 1 with the magnet assembly omitted. The embodiment of Fig. 4 is
substantially similar to that of Fig. 3, except in this case, each of wires 210, 212 and
214 and voice coil lead wires 302, 304 are electrically connected to different contact
regions and the contact regions are moved outside of voice coil 114. It should be
understood that moving the contact regions outside of the voice coil 114 reduces the
number of cut-outs that may need to be formed in the top plate of the magnet
assembly to accommodate electrical connections with the contact regions (see Fig. 6).
Representatively, in this embodiment, SRS 102 includes five contact regions, namely,
contact regions 204 and 206 positioned outside, or concentrically outward, to voice
coil 114, similar to those previously discussed regarding Fig. 3, and additional
contact regions 402, 404 and 406 also positioned outside, or concentrically outward,
of voice coil 114, near an edge of SRS 102. Voice coil lead wires 302, 304 may be
electrically connected (e.g., welded) to contact regions 204, 206, respectively, as
previously discussed, while wires 210, 212 and 214 are electrically connected (e.g.,
welded) to contact regions 402, 404 and 406, respectively. In addition, a trace 408, or
other similar electrical connector may be formed within SRS 102 (e.g., within the
flexible circuit used to form SRS 102), between conductive plate 202 and contact
region 406, to maintain an electrical connection between conductive plate 202 and
wire 214. Similarly, there may be a trace 410 formed between contact regions 204 and
402 and a trace 412 formed between contact regions 206 and 404, for electrically
connecting the regions with one another. Each of the contact regions 204, 206, 402,
404, 406 may include (or be) pads connected to traces or conductive regions within
SRS 102, or be the internal conductive regions exposed through openings formed
within the surface of SRS 102, so that voice coil lead wires 302, 304 and external wires
210, 212, 214 may be electrically connected to a respective one of the contact regions.
[0039]      Fig. 5A illustrates a bottom plan view of the SRS of the transducer of Fig. 1.
SRS 102 is the same as SRS 102 described in reference to Fig. 2-Fig. 3, in that it
includes conductive plate 202 and contact regions 204, 206 and 208. As previously
discussed, SRS 102 may, for example, be formed from a flexible circuit including a
                                              15

                                                       Attorney Docket No.: 004860.P32971PCT
                                                                            Electronically Filed
number of material layers. The various material layers will now be described in
reference to Fig. 5B, which is a cross-sectional side view of portion B (shown in
dashed lines) in Fig. 5A.
[0040]      In particular, it can be seen from Fig. 5B that SRS 102 includes a cover layer
502, a conductive layer 504 and a stiffener layer 506. One or more of cover layer 502,
conductive layer 504 and / or stiffener layer 506 may be preformed layers within the
flexible circuit, which as previously discussed, is thermoformed to achieve the
desired SRS 102 configuration. The cover layer 502 may be made up of one or more
material layers, which serve as a base layer for the overall stack up of material layers
forming the SRS 102. The conductive layer 504 may be made up of one or more
material layers, at least one of which is made of a conductive material, which
provides for electrical connections with SRS 102. For example, the conductive layer
may form the conductive plate 202 shown in Fig. 5A, and /or a trace or other
conductive region of a flexible circuit for electrically connecting the voice coil 114 to
wires 210, 212, as previously discussed. In addition, although not shown, the
conductive layer 504 may include trace 410 that electrically connects contact region
204 to contact region 402, trace 412 that electrically connects contact region 206 to
contact region 404, and trace 408 to electrically connects plate 202 to pad 406, as
previously discussed in reference to Fig. 4. The stiffener layer 506 may be made of
one or more layers of stiffening material that can provide material stiffness to SRS
102. In addition, although not shown, conductive traces, tracks, pads or other
components for providing electrical connections through the various layers may also
be provided.
[0041]      Referring now to each layer in more detail, cover layer 502 may form an
outer surface of SRS 102 and include a polymer layer 508. An adhesive layer 510 may
optionally be provided for attaching the polymer layer 508 to conductive layer 504.
The polymer layer 508 may, for example, be a layer of polyester or polyimide
material. For example, the stiffener layer 506 may be made of a polyester such as
polyethylene naphthalate (PEN). It should be noted that although not specifically
designed for this purpose, the polymer layer 508 may also provide some material
stiffness to the SRS 102. The adhesive layer 510 may be made of any type of adhesive
material suitable for attaching one layer to another, for example, a glue or the like.

                                                                            Electronically Filed
The cover layer 502 may further include a cut-out or opening 522 to allow for a
contact pad 520 (e.g., contact region 208) to electrically connect to conductive layer
504. In addition, although not shown in this view, the cover layer 502 may also have
cutouts for contact regions 204 and 206. It is further noted that with respect to
contact regions 204 and 206, any corresponding pad should not contact the metal
layer 512 of conductive layer 504 (or at least the portion of metal layer 512 that makes
up plate 202).
[0042]      The conductive layer 504 may be stacked on top of the cover layer 502 and
include a metal layer 512 and a polymer layer 514. The metal layer 512 is attached to
the underlying polymer layer 508 of cover layer 502 by the previously discussed
optional adhesive layer 510. The metal layer 512 may be formed of any type of metal
material, for example copper or aluminum, a metal alloy, or other similar material
having metal disposed therein (e.g., metal particles). For example, in one
embodiment, the metal layer 512 is a copper plate, which forms plate 202 shown in
Fig. 5A. The metal layer 512, or a portion of metal layer electrically isolated from a
portion forming plate 202, may form the traces, contacts or other electrically
conductive regions (e.g., traces formed in a flexible circuit) for connecting to the voice
coil, as previously discussed. The polymer layer 514 may include a layer of polyester
or polyimide material. For example, the polymer layer 514 may be made of a
polyimide such as PI. It should be noted that although not specifically designed for
this purpose, the metal layer 512 and polymer layer 514 may also provide some
material stiffness to the SRS 102. In addition, in some cases, the metal layer 512 is
laminated with the polymer layer 514. For example, the metal layer 512 may be
composed of a layer of copper laminated with PEN.
[0043]      The stiffener layer 506 may be stacked on top of the conductive layer 504
and include a polymer layer 518 attached to the conductive layer 504 by an optional
adhesive layer 516. The polymer layer 518 may be made of any polymer material
suitable for providing mechanical stiffness to SRS 102. For example, the polymer
layer 518 may be made of a polyester such as PEN. In addition, a thickness of
polymer layer 518 may be specifically selected to further control its stiffening
properties. For example, the polymer layer 518 may be anywhere from 5 to 100
microns, more specifically about 50 microns. The polymer layer 518 is directly
                                            17

                                                       Attorney Docket No.: 004860.P32971PCT
                                                                            Electronically Filed
attached to polymer layer 514 of conductive layer 504 with optional adhesive layer
516. It should further be noted that the entire stack shown in Fig. 5B (e.g., stiffener
layer 506, conductive layer 504 and cover layer 502) are part of a flexible circuit that
can optionally be thermoformed to be concave or convex as previously discussed.
[0044]     It is further noted that in keeping with the desire to maintain a relatively
low profile transducer, a combined thickness of all the material layers forming SRS
102 may be less than 120 microns, for example, less than 110 microns, or between 15
microns and 120 microns, or from about 100 microns and 120 microns. In this aspect,
each of layers 508, 510, 512, 514, 516 and 518 may vary within a range of from about 5
microns to about 100 microns. For example, in some embodiments, the polymer
layers 508, 514 and 518 may have a thickness of from about 8 microns to about 50
microns, for example, from about 12 microns to 40 microns, for example, from 12.5
microns to 30 microns, or from 15 microns to 20 microns. The metal layer 512, in
some cases, may have a thickness of from about 8 microns to 50 microns, for
example, from about 12 microns to 40 microns, or from about 12.5 microns to 30
microns, or from 15 microns to 20 microns. The optional adhesive layers 510, 516
may have a thickness of from about 10 microns to 50 microns, for example, from 12.5
microns to 30 microns, or from 15 microns to 20 microns.
[0045]     Fig. 6A illustrates a cross-sectional side view of the magnet assembly of the
transducer of Fig. 1. Magnet assembly 112 is the same as the magnet assembly
described in reference to Fig. 1 in that it includes magnet 134, top plate 136 and yoke
138. In addition, top plate 136 includes opening 144 to accommodate the concave
region of the overlying SRS. The opening 144, and other aspects of the top plate 136
can be seen more clearly from the bottom plan view of the top plate shown in Fig. 6B.
In particular, from this view, it can be seen that opening 144 is within a center of top
plate 136 and formed entirely through the plate. In addition, it can be seen that the
corners of top plate 136 are cut-out such that top plate includes one or more corner
cut-out regions 602, 604, 606 and 608. As can be seen from Fig. 6C, which is a bottom
plan view of the top plate of Fig. 6B with the SRS 102 of Fig. 1 included, the corner
cut-out regions 602, 604 and 606 provide openings or recessed regions within corners
of top plate 136 that expose contact regions 204, 206 and 208 so that the external wires
can be connected to contact regions 204, 206 and 208. The cut-out regions 602, 604
                                              18

                                                      Attorney Docket No.: 004860.P32971PCT
                                                                           Electronically Filed
and 606 may be of any size and shape suitable for accommodating access to the
contact regions 204, 206 and 208. Representatively, one or more of the cut-out
regions 602, 604, 606 and 608 may form chamfered regions on the inside of a corner,
on the outside of the corner, or both, of the top plate 136. The contour of a chamfered
portion (that joins with, or is the transition between, the two sides of the top plate
136) may be entirely straight, or it may be curved. In addition, it can be seen that
opening 144 has a similar profile to that the out-of-plane region 110 of SRS 102, for
example, a square shaped profile, in this case. It should further be understood that
while in Fig. 6B and Fig. 6C, top plate 136 is shown having four cut-out regions 602,
604, 606 and 608, fewer cut-out regions may be used depending upon the number of
contact regions. For example, in one embodiment, cut-out region 608 may be omitted
such that only three corners of top plate 136 include cut-out regions 602, 604 and 606.
[0046]     Fig. 7 illustrates a process flow of one embodiment for forming the
suspension member of Fig. 1. In particular, the over molding process 700 includes
the process operation of placing the transducer frame (e.g., bottom frame member
116A) and the SRS (e.g., SRS 102) into a mold cavity (block 702). The mold cavity
may be dimensioned to hold the frame and the SRS in the desired position, and have
the desired suspension member shape. Next, the suspension member material may
be loaded into the mold cavity such that it covers the outer edge of the SRS and inner
surfaces of the frame (block 704). In some cases, the suspension member material is a
silicone material that is melted prior to loading into the mold such that it is injected
in liquid form. Once the material is loaded, a pressure is applied (such as by a mold
top member) to force the suspension member material to be molded into the desired
shape, and to the frame and SRS (block 706). The suspension member material is
then solidified (such as by cooling) to form a suspension member (e.g., suspension
member 118), which is over molded to the SRS and frame. The mold can then be
opened and the frame and SRS, with the suspension member over molded thereto,
removed for further assembly of the other transducer components thereto (e.g., voice
coil, magnet assembly and wiring).
[0047]     Fig. 8 illustrates one embodiment of a simplified schematic view of one
embodiment of an electronic device in which a speaker assembly, such as that
described herein, may be implemented. As seen in Fig. 8, the speaker may be
                                              19

                                                                           Electronically Filed
integrated within a consumer electronic device 802 such as a smart phone with which
a user can conduct a call with a far-end user of a communications device 804 over a
wireless communications network; in another example, the speaker may be
integrated within the housing of a tablet computer. These are just two examples of
where the speaker described herein may be used, it is contemplated, however, that
the speaker may be used with any type of electronic device in which a transducer, for
example, a loudspeaker or microphone, is desired, for example, a tablet computer, a
desk top computing device or other display device.
[0048]      Fig. 9 illustrates a block diagram of some of the constituent components of
an embodiment of an electronic device in which one or more embodiments may be
implemented. Device 900 may be any one of several different types of consumer
electronic devices. For example, the device 900 may be any transducer-equipped
mobile device, such as a cellular phone, a smart phone, a media player, or a tablet
like portable computer.
[0049]     In this aspect, electronic device 900 includes a processor 912 that interacts
with camera circuitry 906, motion sensor 904, storage 908, memory 914, display 922,
and user input interface 924. Main processor 912 may also interact with
communications circuitry 902, primary power source 910, speaker 918 and
microphone 920. Speaker 918 may be a microspeaker such as that described in
reference to Fig. 1. The various components of the electronic device 900 may be
digitally interconnected and used or managed by a software stack being executed by
the processor 912. Many of the components shown or described here may be
implemented as one or more dedicated hardware units and /or a programmed
processor (software being executed by a processor, e.g., the processor 912).
[0050]      The processor 912 controls the overall operation of the device 900 by
performing some or all of the operations of one or more applications or operating
system programs implemented on the device 900, by executing instructions for it
(software code and data) that may be found in the storage 908. The processor 912
may, for example, drive the display 922 and receive user inputs through the user
input interface 924 (which may be integrated with the display 922 as part of a single,
                                              20

                                                                          Electronically Filed
touch sensitive display panel). In addition, processor 912 may send an audio signal
to speaker 918 to facilitate operation of speaker 918.
[0051]     Storage 908 provides a relatively large amount of "permanent" data
storage, using nonvolatile solid state memory (e.g., flash storage) and /or a kinetic
nonvolatile storage device (e.g., rotating magnetic disk drive). Storage 908 may
include both local storage and storage space on a remote server. Storage 908 may
store data as well as software components that control and manage, at a higher level,
the different functions of the device 900.
[0052]      In addition to storage 908, there may be memory 914, also referred to as
main memory or program memory, which provides relatively fast access to stored
code and data that is being executed by the processor 912. Memory 914 may include
solid state random access memory (RAM), e.g., static RAM or dynamic RAM. There
may be one or more processors, e.g., processor 912, that run or execute various
software programs, modules, or sets of instructions (e.g., applications) that, while
stored permanently in the storage 908, have been transferred to the memory 914 for
execution, to perform the various functions described above.
[0053]     The device 900 may include communications circuitry 902.
Communications circuitry 902 may include components used for wired or wireless
communications, such as two-way conversations and data transfers. For example,
communications circuitry 902 may include RF communications circuitry that is
coupled to an antenna, so that the user of the device 900 can place or receive a call
through a wireless communications network. The RF communications circuitry may
include a RF transceiver and a cellular baseband processor to enable the call through
a cellular network. For example, communications circuitry 902 may include Wi-Fi
communications circuitry so that the user of the device 900 may place or initiate a call
using voice over Internet Protocol (VOIP) connection, transfer data through a
wireless local area network.
[0054]     The device may include a microphone 920. Microphone 920 may be an
acoustic-to-electric transducer or sensor that converts sound in air into an electrical
signal. The microphone circuitry may be electrically connected to processor 912 and
power source 910 to facilitate the microphone operation (e.g., tilting).

                                                                           Electronically Filed
[0055]      The device 900 may include a motion sensor 904, also referred to as an
inertial sensor, that may be used to detect movement of the device 900. The motion
sensor 904 may include a position, orientation, or movement (POM) sensor, such as
an accelerometer, a gyroscope, a light sensor, an infrared (IR) sensor, a proximity
sensor, a capacitive proximity sensor, an acoustic sensor, a sonic or sonar sensor, a
radar sensor, an image sensor, a video sensor, a global positioning (GPS) detector, an
RF or acoustic doppler detector, a compass, a magnetometer, or other like sensor.
For example, the motion sensor 904 may be a light sensor that detects movement or
absence of movement of the device 900, by detecting the intensity of ambient light or
a sudden change in the intensity of ambient light. The motion sensor 904 generates a
signal based on at least one of a position, orientation, and movement of the device
900. The signal may include the character of the motion, such as acceleration,
velocity, direction, directional change, duration, amplitude, frequency, or any other
characterization of movement. The processor 912 receives the sensor signal and
controls one or more operations of the device 900 based in part on the sensor signal.
[0056]      The device 900 also includes camera circuitry 906 that implements the
digital camera functionality of the device 900. One or more solid state image sensors
are built into the device 900, and each may be located at a focal plane of an optical
system that includes a respective lens. An optical image of a scene within the
camera's field of view is formed on the image sensor, and the sensor responds by
capturing the scene in the form of a digital image or picture consisting of pixels that
may then be stored in storage 908. The camera circuitry 906 may also be used to
capture video images of a scene.
[0057]      Device 900 also includes primary power source 910, such as a built in
battery, as a primary power supply.

accompanying drawings, it is to be understood that such embodiments are merely
illustrative of and not restrictive on the broad invention, and that the invention is not
limited to the specific constructions and arrangements shown and described, since
various other modifications may occur to those of ordinary skill in the art. For
example, the various speaker components described herein (e.g., diaphragm with
                                             22

flexible PCB, over molded suspension member, magnet top member with an
opening, capacitive sensor, etc.) could be used in an acoustic-to-electric transducer or
other sensor that converts sound in air into an electrical signal, such as for example, a
microphone. The description is thus to be regarded as illustrative instead of limiting.
