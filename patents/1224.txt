                                           ABSTRACT
           Embodiments of the technology may involve a method of processing the human donor

contain a saline solution. This saline solution may include a solvent and a disassociated salt. The
method may further include evaporating a portion of the solvent from a surface of the backing
layer. The evaporation of the solvent may move a portion of the disassociated salt from the donor
tissue to the backing layer. This process may then result in a tissue that is mostly dry and free of
salt crystals.

                                           BACKGROUND
   [0002]     Embodiments of the present invention are directed in general to the field of medical
   dressings, and in particular to methods and apparatus for drying tissue compositions.
   [0003]     Many types of human tissue can be used to help treat a variety of ailments,
15 including for wound care and bum care. One type of human tissue is birth tissue. Human
   birth tissue can be defined as the amniotic sac (which includes two tissue layers, the amnion
   and chorion), the placenta, the umbilical cord, and the cells of fluid contained in each.
   Human amniotic membrane has been used for many years in various surgical procedures,
   including skin transplantation and ocular surface disorder treatments to prevent adhesions.
20 Lately, certain known medical techniques involve the application of amnion tissue to patients
   in the form of surgical dressings. Although amniotic compositions and methods are presently
   available and provide real benefits to patients in need thereof, many advances may still be
   made providing improved dressing systems and manufacturing methods. The dressing
   systems and manufacturing methods described herein provide further solutions and answers
25 to these outstanding needs.
                                         BRIEF SUMMARY
   [0004]     Tissue dressings, such as amniotic tissue dressings, can be used to treat patients.
   Such dressings can be used to treat patients having tarsal tunnel syndrome, iliotibial band
30 stenosis, phantom pain associated with amputation, damaged meniscus, peripheral nerve
   damage or injuries, and the like. Further, dressings can be used in spinal treatments including
   laminectomies, anterior lumbar interbody fusion (ALIF) procedures, laminotomies, and in
                                                    1

   extensor halgus longus tendon surgeries. These tissue dressings may be more easily applied
   and may more easily adhere as dry tissue, relatively salt free tissues, tissues that are flat
   sheets with minimal wrinkles, or supple and pliable tissues. Embodiments of the technology
   described herein encompass techniques for drying the tissue, removing salt crystals, while
 5 preserving other properties of the tissue without prohibitively significant investments in
   capital or time. These drying methods may avoid a chalky, white, inconsistent appearance in
   the tissue. In addition, the drying methods may prevent the tissue from turning a dark brown
   color. The drying methods also may avoid excessive wrinkling and size deformation in the
   tissue. With these methods, the tissues may not become more brittle. Rather, the tissues may
10 have properties similar to cling wrap, allowing the tissue to stick easily to the surface to be
   treated.
   [0005]     In one aspect, embodiments of the technology may involve a method of processing
   the human donor tissue for administration to a recipient. This method may include the step of
   contacting the human donor tissue with a backing layer, where the human donor tissue and
15 the backing layer contain a saline solution. This saline solution may include a solvent and a
   disassociated salt. The method may further include evaporating a portion of the solvent from
   a surface of the backing layer to form a dry tissue. The evaporation of the solvent may move
   a portion of the disassociated salt from the human donor tissue to the backing layer. This
   process may then result in a tissue that is mostly dry and free of salt crystals.
20 [0006]     The tissue may be amniotic tissue. This tissue may be treated with glutaraldehyde
   and then rinsed with a saline solution. The saline solution may be the same or different as the
   saline solution contained in the backing layer. The solvent in the solution may be water. The
   tissue itself may be a single layer or multiple layers of tissues. The backing material may be
   in the form of sheets. The backing layer may also be of woven or nonwoven material. The
25 tissue assembly, comprising the tissue and backing layer, may be pressed together to provide
   better contact between the backing layer and the tissue and to reduce air pockets and excess
   moisture.
   [0007]     The backing layer may be in contact with a plate. The human donor tissue may be
   restrained between the first plate and a second plate. The plates used in the tissue assembly
30 may be perforated. The plates may be perforated to the extent such that 5-95% of the plate
   area is open. These plates may be clamped around the tissue assembly to help the tissue
   remain flat, with little or no wrinkling.
                                                    2

   [0008]     Evaporating the solvent may be accomplished using forced gas flow. The drying of
   the tissue assembly may be done in a chamber. The chamber may or may not include
   heating. The heating may be done by heating the chamber itself or by heating the forced gas
   before it reaches the chamber. The heating may include temperatures of below about 40'C,
 5 temperatures of below about 25 0 C, temperatures between about 5 and about 15'C, or no
   heating at all. The drying may be done with a forced gas flow for at least 1.5 hours. The
   drying process may also include moving the plates mechanically, possibly like a windmill or
   fan. The plates may be moved for all, substantially all, or a portion of the drying process, and
   moving the plates may not include transferring the plates into or out of the chamber. The
10 movement may reduce the amount of forced gas flow needed, the heating temperature, or the
   drying time.
   [0009]     The final tissue produced may be a flat sheet with minimal wrinkles. The tissue
   may have a moisture content of less than 10% or it may be less than 5%. The dry tissue may
   reach an equilibrium moisture content, where the tissue will not absorb a significant quantity
15 of moisture when exposed to the ambient atmosphere for an extended period of time.
   [0010]     After the drying process, the tissue may be rehydrated. The backing layer may also
   be removed from the tissue. The tissue also may be trimmed to remove some areas with
   discoloration or other undesired property.
   [0011]     In another aspect, embodiments of this technology may include a method of
20 processing an amniotic tissue for administration to a recipient patient. The method may
   include treating the amniotic tissue with a glutaraldehyde solution. Additionally, the method
   may include rinsing the amniotic tissue with a first saline solution. The method may further
   include contacting the amniotic tissue with a first backing layer and a second backing layer.
   The amniotic tissue may contain a second saline solution that includes a solvent and a
25 dissociated salt. The first and second backing layers may contain the second saline solution.
   [0012]     The method may include restraining the amniotic tissue, the first backing layer, and
   the second backing layer between a first plate and a second plate. The method may also
   include pressing together the amniotic tissue and the first and second backing layers. The
   method may further include evaporating a portion of the solvent from a surface of the first or
30 the second backing layer, which may move a portion of the dissociated salt from the amniotic
   tissue into the first or second backing layer. Evaporating may include maintaining a
   temperature around the amniotic tissue below about 40'C.
                                                    3

   [0013]     In another aspect, embodiments of this technology may also include an apparatus
   for drying tissue. The apparatus may include human donor tissue placed in contact with and
   between at least two layers of backing material. This tissue and backing layer may then be
   restrained by two plates. This tissue may be amniotic tissue. The backing layer may include
 5 woven or nonwoven material. This backing layer may be wetted with a saline solution.
   [0014]     At least one of the plates of the tissue drying apparatus may be perforated. The
   tissue assembly along with the plates may then be placed inside a chamber configured to
   receive the plates and tissue assembly. The chamber may be configured so that gas can be
   forced into the chamber with the gas flow going around the plates and the tissue assembly.
10 [0015]     In another aspect, embodiments of this technology may also include a dry, mostly
   salt crystal free, pliable tissue with minimal wrinkles, produced by the various embodiments
   of this invention. This tissue may be amniotic tissue.

                                      DETAILED DESCRIPTION
   [0028]    Embodiments of the present invention encompass systems and methods for
   processing tissue for use in wound care, so as to allow removal of water and salt crystals
15 without creating significant wrinkling or discoloration. In addition such drying methods may
   allow for amnion tissue to have desirable properties such as pliability, suppleness, and
   dinginess when rehydrated. These dried tissues may easily be applied to and adhere to
   wounds or other treatment areas.
   [0029]    Turning to the drawings, FIG. 1 illustrates tissue features of a human fetal sac
20 structure 100, including the anatomy of the amnion A and chorion C. As shown here, the
   amnion layer has several cell layers and has two sides with different cellular components.
   According to this depiction, the amnion A includes a single layer of ectodermally derived
   columnar epithelial cells AE adhered to a basement membrane AB. In turn the basement
   membralle AB includes collagen I, collagen III, collagen IV, laminin, glycosaminoglycans,
25 and fibronectin, and is attached to an underlying layer of connective tissue. The connective
   tissue includes an acellular compact layer AC of reticular fibers, a fibroblast layer AF, and a
   spongy layer AS (referred to as Wharton's jelly) which form a network of fine fibrils
   surrounded by mucus. When the amnion A is separated from the chorion C, a two sided,
   asymmetrical tissue is produced having an epithelial layer AE with epithelial cells on one
30 side and a fibroblast layer AF on the opposite side. Hence, the separated amnion A includes
   an epithelial layer AE on one side and a fibroblast layer AF on the opposing side. Between
   the epithelial and fibroblast layers is a basement membrane AB and a compact layer AC. The
                                                   5

   fibroblast layer may be considered to include a loose network of reticulum containing
   fibroblasts. The fibroblast layer also typically includes collagen (e.g. Types I, III, and VI) and
   glycoproteins (e.g. nidogen, laminin, and fibronectin).
   [0030]     FIG. 2 shows an embodiment of the plate assembly 200 used in sandwiching the
 5 tissue assembly. These plates may be made out of stainless steel, aluminum, or some other
   material. These plates may be perforated, with over 50% of the surface area open. In some
   embodiments, over 70% of the surface area may be open. The perforated holes may be
   hexagonal, circular, elliptical, or some other shape. The drawing shows the main plates 202
   surrounded by supports 204. The two plates and supports are connected by hinges 206. The
10 hinges allow the plates to close around the tissue assembly. When closed, the plates may be
   parallel to each other.
   [0031]     FIG. 3 shows an embodiment of the pressed tissue assembly sandwich 300. The
   amniotic tissues 302 are sandwiched between the backing layers 304. This sandwich is
   further surrounded by the plates 306. The plates 306 may be the same plates 202 in FIG. 2.
15 As discussed below, the sandwich may be placed into a chamber for drying so as to remove
   solvent from the tissue and backing layer material.
   [0032]     FIG. 4A shows the solvent and salt concentration in the amniotic tissue 4002 and
   backing layer 4004 at time equal to to, the beginning of the drying process. The solvent in the
   figure is water. Water molecules, such as 4006, are present in both the amniotic tissue 4002
20 and backing layer 4004. The salt exists in dissociated form (cation 4008 and anion 4010) in
   the amniotic tissue 4002, and the salt is in dissociated form (cation 4012 and anion 4014) in
   the backing layer 4004. At time to, gas flow 4016 has just begun. The gas flows in a
   direction, as depicted by arrow D.
   [0033]     FIG. 4B depicts the drying process at a time equal to t1, where t1 is greater than to.
25 Water 4018 leaves the backing layer 4020 with the gas flow 4022 in the direction of arrow E.
   At this point, the salt ion concentrations in the amniotic tissue 4024 and backing layer 4020
   are about the same as at time to, in FIG. 4A.
   [0034]     FIG. 4C shows continued drying of the tissue 4026 and backing layer 4028 at time
   equal to t2 , where t2 is greater than t1. Following a period of drying, more water molecules
30 4030 go into the gas flow 4032, which moves in the direction as indicated by arrow F. In
   addition, fewer water molecules 4034 are present at the surface of the backing layer 4036
                                                     6

   closest to the amniotic tissue 4026 than at time equal to t in FIG. 4B. Salt ions 4038 in the
   backing layer 4028 move along with the water toward the gas flow 4032.
   [0035]    In FIG. 4D, the drying process continues at time equal to t, where t 3 is greater than
   t2 . More water 4040 continues to escape to the gas flow 4042, moving in a direction
 5 indicated by arrow G. This leaves areas 4044 of no water in the backing layer 4046 and areas
   4048 of no water in the amniotic tissue 4050. As more water leaves the backing layer, the
   salt ions near the surface 4052 of the backing layer 4046 coalesce to become salt crystals
   4054 rather than dissociated species.
   [0036]    FIG. 4E shows drying at time equal to t 4 , where t 4 is greater than t3 . Water 4056
10 continues to go from the amniotic tissue 4058 into the backing layer 4060. The direction of
   the movement of water from the amniotic tissue to the backing layer is depicted by arrows H
   and I. The water subsequently goes into the gas flow 4062, which moves in a direction as
   indicated by arrow J. Water may bring ions (anion 4064 and cation 4066) out of the amniotic
   tissue 4058 into the backing layer 4060. As the surface 4068 of the backing layer 4060 dries,
15 the ions coalesce into salts 4070 at the surface 4068 of the backing layer 4060.
   [0037]    FIG. 4F shows the continuation of this process at time t5, where t 5 is greater than t4 .
   The salt concentrations 4070 build up at the surface 4072 of the backing layer 4074, while
   fewer ions (anion 4076 and cation 4078) are left in the amniotic tissue 4080. Water
   molecules 4082 are carried away by the gas flow 4084, which moves in the direction
20 indicated by arrow K.
   [0038]    FIGS. 4G shows the process at time t 6 , where t 6 is greater than t5 . Salt crystals 4086
   continue to build up at the surface 4088 of the backing layer 4090. Fewer ions (anion 4092
   and cation 4094) are left in the amniotic tissue 4096. Water molecules 4098 are carried away
   by the gas flow 4100, which moves in the direction indicated by arrow L.
25 [0039]    FIGS. 4H shows the process at time t 7 , where t 7 is greater than t 6 . Salt crystals 4102
   continue to build up at the surface 4104 of the backing layer 4106. Fewer ions (anion 4108
   and cation 4110) are left in the amniotic tissue 4112. Water molecules 4114 are carried away
   by the gas flow 4116, which moves in the direction indicated by arrow M.
   [0040]    FIGS. 41 shows the process at time t8 , where t6 is greater than t 7 . Salt crystals 4118
30 continue to build up at the surface 4120 of the backing layer 4122. A few ions (anion 4124
                                                    7

   and cation 4126) remain in the amniotic tissue 4128. Water molecules 4130 are carried away
   by the gas flow 4132, which moves in the direction indicated by arrow N.
   [0041]    FIGS. 4J shows the process at time t9 , where t9 is greater than t8. Salt crystals 4134
   continue to build up at the surface 4136 of the backing layer 4138. A few ions 4140 and
 5 4142 remain in the amniotic tissue 4144. Water molecules 4146 are carried away by the gas
   flow 4148, which moves in the direction indicated by arrow 0. Few water molecules 4150
   remain in the amniotic tissue 4144, and few water molecules 4152 are left in the backing
   layer 4138.
   [0042]    FIGS. 4K shows the process at time t1 o, where tio is greater than t9 . Salt crystals
10 4154 have almost finished building up at the surface 4156 of the backing layer 4158. A few
   ions (anion 4160 and cation 4162) remain in the amniotic tissue 4164. Some water molecules
   4166 are carried away by the gas flow 4168, which moves in the direction indicated by arrow
   P. Few water molecules 4170 remain in the amniotic tissue 4164, and few water molecules
   4172 are left in the backing layer 4158.
15 [0043]    FIG. 4L shows the result at near the end of the drying process at time tj, where ti,
   is greater than t1 o. Almost all of the ions coalesce as salt crystals 4174 at the surface 4176 of
   the backing layer 4178, while little water 4180 remains in the backing layer 4178 and little
   water 4182 remains in the amniotic tissue 4184. The amniotic tissue 4184 may have some
   ionic species (anion 4186 and cation 4188) in it but far fewer than when the process started at
20 time to in FIG. 4A. Although there may still be gas flow 4190, little or no water moves from
   the backing layer 4178 to the gas flow 4190. The drying process depicted in FIGS. 4A-4L
   may be carried out in a drying chamber.
   [0044]    FIG. 5A shows an embodiment of the chamber apparatus 500. The chamber box
   502 has a rack 508 to receive the pressed tissue assembly sandwich 300 of FIG. 3. This
25 chamber box 502 is attached to a shell 504 and gate 506, from which the gas flow comes, as
   indicated by arrows    Q. The gate 506 can be closed in order to disperse the gas flow. The
   chamber may also operate without gate 506.
   [0045]    FIG. 5B shows an embodiment of the chamber apparatus 550 without a gate. The
   chamber box 552 has a rack 554 to receive the pressed tissue assembly sandwich 300 of FIG.
30 3. The chamber box 552 has a frame 556. The chamber box 552 is attached to a frame 558
   coupled with a manifold 560. The manifold 560 may have a single input for gas flow and
   have multiple outputs. The gas flow may be represented by arrows         Q.  The manifold may
                                                     8

   have multiple inputs but have a greater number of outputs to distribute the gas flow
   substantially evenly across the width of chamber box 552. The manifold may include
   different spray nozzles to disperse the gas.
   [0046]    FIG. 6A shows an embodiment of the shell 600. The shell 600 is depicted as 504 in
 5 FIG. 5. In this figure, the shell 600 may be trapezoidal in shape, with an inlet orifice 602 for
   the gas flow at the smaller end of the trapezoid 604. A pipe 606 delivers gas to the inlet
   orifice 602. The gas used to dry the tissue may be substantially free of particulates. The gas
   may flow through a filter 608, which may be a HEPA filter, a 0.2 ptm filter, a Walker filter, a
   Balston/Parker filter, or another type of filter. A valve 610 can shut off the flow of gas. The
10 pipe may be fitted with a control device 612, which can control the temperature, flow rate,
   quality (e.g. absence of oil, water, and/or dirt), or other characteristics of the gas flow.
   Although not pictured in FIG. 6A, the pipe may also include a heater (e.g., a Walker heater)
   and a regulator. The gas comes from a source 614, which may be a gas cylinder or an on-site
   supply of air. The source 614 of gas may be purified air, compressed air, nitrogen, or inert
15 gases.
   [0047]    FIG. 6B shows another perspective of shell 600. A nozzle 616 may extend past the
   smaller end of the trapezoid 604. Upon exiting the nozzle, the gas expands, as illustrated by
   arrows R, through the chamber 302 of FIG. 3 to cover the width of the plate assembly.
   [0048]    FIG. 7 shows the steps involved in a drying process, according to an embodiment of
20 the present invention. A tissue is first provided in step 702. Then in step 704, the tissue is
   contacted with a backing layer. Both the tissue and backing layer contain a saline solution
   comprising a solvent and a dissociated salt. In step 706, some of the solvent is evaporated
   from the surface of the backing layer. This evaporation helps move some dissociated salt
   from the donor tissue into the backing layer. Exemplary aspects of such drying techniques
25 are depicted in FIGS. 4A-4L.
   [0049]    FIG. 8 shows operations in a drying process according to embodiments of the
   present invention. Amniotic tissue is treated with a glutaraldehyde solution in step 802. In
   step 804, the amniotic tissue is rinsed with a first saline solution. Then in step 806, the
   amniotic tissue is contacted with a first backing layer and a second backing layer. The
30 amniotic tissue may contain a second saline solution that includes a solvent and a dissociated
   salt. The amniotic tissue, the first backing layer, and the second backing layer may be
   restrained between a first plate and a second plate, as in step 808. In step 810, the amniotic
                                                     9

   tissue and the first and second backing layers may be pressed together. Then in step 812, a
   portion of the solvent may be evaporated from a surface of the first or the second backing
   layer. A portion of the dissociated salt from the amniotic tissue may move from the amniotic
   tissue into the first or second backing layer. Evaporating may include maintaining a
 5 temperature around the amniotic tissue below about 40'C or may include any of the
   evaporating techniques described herein.
   [0050]     FIG. 9 is a photograph of amniotic tissue air dried with a backing layer, according
   to embodiments disclosed herein. This tissue has minimal wrinkles and discoloration.
   [0051]     In contrast, FIG. 10 is a photograph of freeze dried (lyophilized) amniotic tissue.
10 This tissue has discoloration, likely caused by salt crystals.
   [0052]     FIG. 11 is a graph of the rate of moisture loss in amniotic tissue processed in an air
   drying chamber, according to embodiments of the present invention. After 90 min. of
   ambient forced air drying, the tissues reach a moisture content of less than 15%. Continued
   drying after the initial 90 min. does not reduce the moisture content as quickly as before the
15 initial 90 min. The tissue has reached an equilibrium moisture level and does not easily re
   adsorb moisture from the air.
   [0053]     FIG. 12 is a graph of the effect of ambient humidity on the moisture content of dried
   amniotic tissue, according to embodiments of the present invention. When exposed to
   ambient atmosphere, the tissues do not absorb a significant quantity of moisture,
20 demonstrating that the tissue has reached an equilibrium moisture level.
   [0054]     Embodiments of this technology include a process of producing a dry tissue, one
   that is mostly free of salt crystals. The tissue may first be treated in a saline solution. The
   saline solution may include a salt and a solvent, which may be water. The solvent may be
   any solvent that evaporates gradually and any solvent in which a salt ionizes. The salt may
25 be any salt that is ionized in the solvent. The tissue may include multiple types of salts. For
   example, a salt may be an inorganic salt, sodium chloride, or any salt found in amnion. The
   tissue may then be placed in contact with at least one backing layer to form a tissue assembly.
   The backing layer may also have been treated with a saline solution. Some of the solvent
   may be evaporated from the surface of the backing layer, whether by forced gas, heating, or
30 other methods. When the solvent is evaporated, the solvent helps move the portion of the
   dissociated salt from the donor tissue to the backing layer.
                                                    10

   [0055]     The tissue may be amniotic tissue, skin tissue, fascia tissue, muscle tissue, tendon
   tissue, cartilage tissue, adipose tissue, or another type of human tissue. The tissue may be
   treated first with a glutaraldehyde solution and then rinsed with a saline solution. The tissue
   may also be prepared in accordance with the procedure as described in U.S. Patent
 5 Publication No. 2012/0083900 Al, whose contents are incorporated herein by reference for
   all purposes. With returning reference to FIG. 1, the amnion A is separated from the chorion
   C, and the fibroblast layer AF is intact after preparation of the amnion. The tissue may
   exclude chorion. The solvent in the saline solution may be water or another solvent. The
   tissue may have multiple layers of tissues.
10 [0056]     The backing layer may be woven or nonwoven material. Woven or nonwoven
   material may be paper products, such as filters, absorbent paper, tissue paper, gauze, and
   wicking material. Backing layer material may be any material that can adsorb moisture and
   allow for passage of the migrating moisture and ions. For the nonwoven material, numerous
   materials could be used. Exemplary materials are ones that when the material becomes wet
15 with solution, the moisture can be removed by the flow of gas. The moisture removed may
   be the solvent and may include any other liquids that may have been present in the tissue.
   The materials may be sterilized. The materials may also be materials that do not interact with
   the tissue. The backing layer may be in the form of sheets. The tissue assembly may be
   pressed together to assure greater surface contact between different layers of materials. This
20 pressing may also help eliminate any air or gas pockets and may remove excess moisture.
   [0057]     The backing layer may be in contact with a plate. The human donor tissue and any
   backing layers may be restrained by at least one plate or at least two plates. With returning
   reference to FIG. 2, the plates 202 may be connected by a hinge 206 so that the plates 202
   can close flush against each other. The plates may be perforated. A plate may be perforated
25 so 5% to 95% of its surface area is open. In one embodiment, the plate is perforated
   aluminum with 79% open in the form of hexagonal holes. The plates may also be stainless
   steel or some other material. These plates may then be clamped around the tissue assembly.
   This may result in the layers shown in FIG. 3. Several different patches of tissue may fit
   inside one set of plates.
30 [0058]     The evaporating or drying of the solvent could be done using the forced flow of gas
   around the tissue. The forced gas helps to evaporate the solvent from the saline solution in
   the backing layer. With returning reference to FIGS. 4B and without being bound to any
                                                     11

   particular theory, water may first move from the backing layer to the gas flow. This may
   create a lower concentration of moisture in the backing layer and a concentration gradient
   from the amniotic tissue to the backing layer. As shown in FIGS. 4C-4K, water then
   migrates from the higher concentration in the tissue to the lower concentration in the backing
 5 layer. As shown in FIGS. 4C-4L, the movement of water also may help drive salt ions from
   the tissue into the backing layer. The ions may eventually gather near the surface of the
   backing layer, forming salt crystals 4054, as shown in FIGS. 4D. FIGS. 4E-4L show these
   crystals growing larger. At the end of drying, the tissue may be largely free of moisture and
   salt crystals. The backing layer may be largely free of moisture but have salt crystals 4174 on
10 its surface, as depicted in FIG. 4L. This drying process may then leave behind a pliable
   tissue with only trace amounts of salt and a moisture content of about 10%. The plates and
   the tissue assembly may allow the tissue to dry flat and without wrinkling as it dries. The
   tissue may then be a flat smooth sheet that is flexible and dry to the touch. This tissue then
   may be easier to handle and manipulate prior to implantation.
15 [0059]     The drying in the chamber may be done with gas flow but without the addition of
   heat. Heated may be added directly to the chamber or the gas flow may be heated prior to the
   gas entering the chamber. Gas flow rates may be from 3 gallons per minute to 10 gallons per
   minute. The drying may also be done in temperatures from about 50 C to about 40'C. Drying
   in gas flow may be done for at least 1.5 hours and may be less than 3 hours. In addition,
20 drying may be performed by moving the plates and the tissue assembly mechanically. This
   movement may be in a radial direction like a windmill or fan, in a linear direction, or in a
   direction that may be both radial and linear. Mechanical movement may reduce the amount
   of gas flow needed for drying. The drying process may be performed without a desiccant.
   [0060]     The final moisture content of the tissue may be less than 10%, including less than
25 5%. The amount of moisture left in the tissue may reach an equilibrium point. At the
   equilibrium moisture, when the tissue is left in ambient air for a long time, including times of
   several days, the tissue will not gain a significant amount of moisture from the ambient air.
   [0061]     The final concentration of salt left may be from about 0.03% to about 0.18% by
   weight of the weight of the final product tissue. For example, the final concentration of the
30 salt may be from about 0.03 % to about 0.10%, from about 0.030%to about 0.150%, from about
   0.04% to about 0.09%, or about 0.07% by weight of the weight of the final product tissue.
   The tissue may not be completely salt free.
                                                    12

   [0062]     After the drying is done, the backing layer may be removed from the tissue. Any
   areas of discoloration or other non-uniformities may be trimmed from the tissue. The tissue
   also may later be rehydrated with a liquid comprising water or saline solution (e.g., 0.9%
   saline solution). The saline solution may have a concentration of less than about 0.9%.
 5 Rehydradtion may involve soaking by flow of solvent, immersion in a solvent, or soaking the
   implant with a solvent by irrigation. In some cases, the wetting solvent may be fluids from
   the surgical site of the implant.
   [0063]     Salt content may have an effect on the rate of rehydration. A tissue with a higher
   salt content may rehydrate more quickly than a tissue with lower salt content. If a tissue
10 rehydrates too quickly, the tissue may cling to itself. The tissue may ball up and no longer
   resemble a flat sheet, making the tissue difficult to apply to a patient. A medical practitioner
   may want to reposition the tissue after its initial application and too fast of a rehydration rate
   may make repositioning the tissue difficult. Embodiments of the present technology include
   tissues that rehydrate over minutes rather than seconds. When water is applied to these
15 tissues, the water may initially bead up on the tissue.
   [0064]     In another aspect, an embodiment of this technology may be an apparatus for drying
   human donor tissue. This tissue drying apparatus may include the tissue placed in contact
   with at least one backing layer. This tissue assembly may be restrained by two plates, similar
   to those shown in FIG. 2. The tissue may be amniotic tissue or other tissue derived from
20 humans. The tissue may also come from animals.
   [0065]     The tissue may be placed in contact with a second backing layer. The backing layer
   may be made of woven or nonwoven material. The material may also be wetted with saline
   solution. For amniotic tissue, the backing layer may be placed on the epithelial surface of the
   amniotic tissue. At least one of the plates may be perforated.
25 [0066]     The tissue drying apparatus may also include the chamber, as shown in FIG. 5, that
   can receive the plates, tissue, and backing layer. The chamber may also be configured to
   receive more than one set of plates. This chamber may have an inlet to allow for gas to flow
   through the chamber and around the plates in order to dry the tissue and backing layer. The
   gas may be delivered to the chamber through the use of a pipe, tube, manifold, or other
30 device. A filter may be included as part of the gas delivery system in order to remove
   unwanted contaminants. The gas may also be delivered into the chamber by a nozzle 616 in
   FIG. 6B. This nozzle may extend some distance into the chamber rather than be flush with
                                                    13

   the chamber wall, in order to deliver better quality gas flow to the tissues and plates. The
   chamber may be configured with other gas dispersion techniques.
   [0067]    The tissue dried by this process may be mostly salt crystal free, pliable, with
   minimal wrinkles. The tissue may appear as shown in FIG. 7. The tissue may have a
 5 consistent appearance, including areas that appear white or chalky. In contrast, a tissue dried
   by freeze drying may have the discoloration shown in FIG. 10. The tissue dried by freeze
   drying may be dominated by white discoloration, which may appear in blotches.
                                              EXAMPLES
                                               Example 1
10 [0068]    Tissue from amniotic donors is processed by removing the amnion from the
   placenta by blunt dissection and then clearing the chorion, Wharton's jelly, and blood from
   the amnion by rinsing and scraping with gloved finger tips. The tissue is treated with 1%
   glutaraldehyde for 15 minutes and then rinsed with three 400 mL volumes of 0.9% saline
   solution. Once the tissue is rinsed, the amnion is spread on a cutting surface, stromal side
15 down, and precut pieces of backing material are placed on the epithelial surface. In this
   example, the backing layer is a DELNET apertured films product (DELNET 3.3 NPET-E
   non-woven backing material, available from DelStar Technologies, Inc.) and has a sticky side
   and a non-sticky side. In this case, the sticky side viewed under a microscope resembles the
   loop part of a VELCRO fastener, and the non-sticky side is similar to the white pad of an
20 adhesive bandage. Here, the non-sticky side of the backing layer is placed in contact with the
   epithelial side of the amnion. The amnion is cut with a scalpel to the shape of the backing
   layer, and the backing with the amnion is flipped over. The amnion is adjusted to assure that
   the amnion is flat and spread evenly over the backing layer. A second patch is then cut the
   same way, and the two patches are assembled into a sandwich of four layers: backing layer
25 amnion-amnion-backing layer. The two amniotic stromal surfaces are then pressed together
   between two plates, as shown in FIG. 3. These samples are in sizes of 2 x 2, 2 x 4, 4 x 4, 4 x
   8, and 8 x 16 cm.
                                               Example 2
   [0069]    After the tissues are pressed, the tissues and backing layers are placed between two
30 stainless steel perforated plates and clamped together to keep the sandwiched assembly
   together. The stainless steel plate is then placed in a BIO-RAD GELAIR dryer. The fan is
                                                    14

   turned on with no heat, and the sandwiched assembly is allowed to dry to its equilibrium
   point. With no heat, the temperature ranges from between 18 and 250 C. Experimental
   determination of the equilibrium point is described in Example 4.
   [0070]    To determine the time required to dry double-sided amnion (the two amnion layers
 5 in the sandwich) in a chamber with positive ambient airflow, tissue samples are dried for
   varying amounts of time and the moisture content of the samples is measured. A separate set
   of four samples is pulled at times of 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, and 150 minutes. After the sample is
   exposed for a specific time, the samples are labeled and immediately placed in an individual
   KAPAK pouch and sealed to prevent the continued evaporation or gain of moisture. After all
10 samples are collected, each sample is pulled from the backing layer. The sample is weighed
   and then placed in a 100 C oven for 30 minutes and then re-weighed. The difference in
   weight is attributed to moisture loss. Results are shown in Table 1 and in FIG. 11.

   [0072]    In order to determine the moisture equilibrium point for amniotic tissues, 20
 5 amniotic tissue assemblies are exposed to ambient humidity of between 14% and 17% for
   two hours. These tissue assembles had previously been treated with a saline solution and
   then dried previously during processing. Each tissue assembly is weighed then placed in a
   100 0 C oven and allowed to warm for 30 minutes. Immediately after the 30 minutes, each
   tissue assembly is weighed again and the difference in weight measurements attributed to
10 moisture loss. In this experiment, the average loss of weight is 4 . 9 % with a high value of
   7.6% and the low value of 1.2%. This experiment included 11 4 x 8 cm patches and nine 4 x
   4 centimeter patches. This experiment shows an equlibrium moisture level of under        ll1%.
                                               Example 5
   [0073]    Other amnion drying methods have also been explored. Freeze drying at a pressure
15 less than 10 mTorr for 12 hours caused the patch to take on a chalky white inconsistent
   appearance from the salt, as shown in FIG. 10. Oven drying at a temperature greater than
   40'C for 30 minutes caused the patch to turn a dark brown and appear more brittle. Air
   drying with no backing layer left the patch with excessive wrinkling and size deformation.
   [0074]    Having described several embodiments, it will be recognized by those of skill in the
20 art that various modifications, alternative constructions, and equivalents may be used without
   departing from the spirit of the invention. Additionally, a number of well-known processes
   and elements have not been described in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the present
   invention. Accordingly, the above description should not be taken as limiting the scope of
   the invention.
25 [0075]    Where a range of values is provided, it is understood that each intervening value, to
   the tenth of the unit of the lower limit unless the context clearly dictates otherwise, between
   the upper and lower limits of that range is also specifically disclosed. Each smaller range

   smaller ranges may independently be included or excluded in the range, and each range
   where either, neither, or both limits are included in the smaller ranges is also encompassed
 5 within the invention, subject to any specifically excluded limit in the stated range. Where the
