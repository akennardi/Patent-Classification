    Field of the Invention
    The present invention generally relates to the field of dietary therapies for treating disorders
    associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, including epilepsy.
  5 Background of the Invention
    Any discussion of the prior art throughout the specification should in no way be considered
    as an admission that such prior art is widely known or forms part of common general
    knowledge in the field.
    Epilepsy covers a broad range of neurological disorders that are characterised by seizures.
 .0 Seizures result from abnormal neuronal activity and manifest in a number of ways, including
    convulsions and loss of awareness. In many cases epilepsy can be managed by the use of
    anti-convulsive medication. However for a proportion of patients with epilepsy, treatment with
    conventional drugs can have minimal effect upon seizure activity. Although surgery is an
    option for treating patients suffering from certain seizures, for many individuals successful
 .5 management can be achieved less invasively with the ketogenic diet.
    Ketogenic diets have a high fat and low carbohydrate content with sufficient protein for
    growth and repair; vitamin and mineral levels are typically inadequate and may be required
    to be provided as supplements. Ketogenic diets function by forcing the body to metabolise
    fat instead of carbohydrate as its energy source. Under low dietary carbohydrate conditions,
  0 fats are broken down into fatty acids and ketone bodies in the liver, and these compounds
    are utilised in further metabolic pathways for generating adenosine triphosphate (ATP) as a
    chemical energy source.
    Studies have shown a clear benefit of the ketogenic diet in treating intractable epilepsy in
    children and adults. Short-term trials have demonstrated that approximately half of those
25  studied had at least a 50% reduction in seizures after 6 months, and approximately one third
    reached at least a 90% reduction. In certain cases, the ketogenic diet is sufficiently effective
    to enable a reduction in the levels of prescribed anti-epileptic medication and also to improve
    quality of life.
    Ketogenic diets must be strictly controlled to ensure effective seizure prevention whilst
30  maintaining adequate nutritional value. The diets are developed and optimised on a case-by
    case basis under medical supervision, and all food must be carefully measured and
                                                    1

    prepared. Deviation from the diet may result in the patient experiencing renewed seizures
    within a short period of time.
    Although clearly effective, ketogenic diets are difficult to manage in both children and adults.
    Current approaches to the ketogenic diet can be very restrictive and this can lead to poor
  5 compliance, particularly in adults. Furthermore, such diets can result in a number of side
    effects (including problems of the digestive system, increased serum lipid levels, drowsiness,
    poor growth and increased risk of fractures), and are entirely unsuitable for certain patients.
    Identification of the active component(s) of the ketogenic diet responsible for supressing
    seizure activity therefore has the capability to dramatically simplify treatment and improve
 .0 the quality of life for a significant number of patients with epilepsy.
    No one knows how the diet works. A metabolic change occurs in the body which affects
    brain chemistry. One theory attributes the anti-seizure effect of the diet to the ketones that
    the ketogenic diet produces. Ketones are the products of fat breakdown. The body normally
    burns glucose for energy. The body can use these ketones as a source of energy instead of
 .5 glucose.
    Although the biochemical basis for the effectiveness of the ketogenic diet is unclear, a
    number of studies have highlighted a connection with altered mitochondrial function and
    increased mitochondrial biogenesis [Bough, K.J. et al. Ann. Neurol. 60, 223-235 (2006)].
    Mitochondria are organelles present in almost every cell in the body. They play pivotal roles
  0 in a number of cellular processes, most prominently in energy metabolism. Provision of
    energy is achieved by the integrated function of the electron transport chain (ETC), which
    receives reducing equivalents from key metabolic pathways such as the tricarboxylic acid
    (TCA) cycle and fatty acid p-oxidation.
    Compromised mitochondrial function may arise through inherited or acquired mutations in
25  both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA, and may also be acquired as a result of exposure to
    environmental factors. Mitochondrial dysfunction is associated with a wide range of clinical
    conditions, which generally affect organs with high energy requirements such as muscle,
    liver, kidney and brain. A paucity of energy in the brain, in the form of ATP, leads to
    neurological impairment that can include seizures. Indeed, mitochondrial dysfunction has
30  been linked to certain inherited and acquired epilepsies, although it is also associated with a
    number of other disease states, including diabetes, dementias including Alzheimer's
    disease, and Parkinson's disease.
                                                      2

    Multiple direct links exist therefore between the effects of the ketogenic diet, increased
    mitochondrial    function   and    biogenesis,    and    alleviation  of epileptic     seizures.    As
    implementation of the ketogenic diet presents a number of challenges, products which target
    the same biological mechanisms are clearly highly desirable.
  5 Summary of the Invention
    The ketogenic diet has a number of characteristic metabolic effects including increased
    ketone body formation and elevated plasma levels of medium chain fatty acids. There is no
    known correlation between ketone body levels and seizure control, and relatively little
    research has been carried out on the effects of the increased fatty acid concentrations.
 .0 We have determined that decanoic acid, a medium chain fatty acid that increases in plasma
    concentration as a result of a ketogenic diet in which MCT forms a part, has a direct effect
    on mitochondrial function and availability in cells in vitro.
    Thus, decanoic acid may be beneficial for the treatment of epilepsy, particularly in patients
    who currently require a ketogenic diet; diseases associated with inherited mitochondrial
 .5 dysfunction; and patients with acquired mitochondrial disorders, including those with
    diabetes, Parkinson's disease and dementias including Alzheimer's disease.

  5 Detailed Description
    By elucidating the mechanism associated with the benefits of ketogenic diets we overcome
    some of the problems associated with prior compositions by providing a highly effective
    product which can be formulated to increase its palatability and deliver a specific level of
    C10.    Moreover it allows diseases to be treated by the use of C10 outside of the strict
 .0 confines of the classic ketogenic diet.
    Briefly, the classical version of the ketogenic diet uses ratios to determine and describe fat
    content. Thus, the ketogenic ratio represents the relationship between the grams of fat and
    the combined grams of protein and carbohydrate. In a 4:1 ratio there are four times as many
    grams of fat for every 1 g of protein and carbohydrate combined. The ratio is traditionally
 .5 intended to regulate the degree of ketosis, with higher ratios theoretically stimulating greater
    ketosis. The MCT version of the ketogenic diet uses percentage energy from fat to
    determine and describe fat content. The other two versions of the ketogenic diet are the so
    called modified Atkins diet and the low glycaemic (GI) index diet, which encourage people to
    ingest a lot of fat. In these two latter diets neither the ratio nor the percentage of fat is
 .0 formally calculated although typically the ketogenic ratio is about 1:1. In all 4 versions of the
    ketogenic diet the percentage of total energy from fat ranges from 50 - 92% but is typically
    70 - 90%. In any event whichever form of the diet one follows it is necessary to ingest a lot
    of fat to achieve efficacy and this can impact severely on patient compliance.          However,
    following the teaching of the present invention it may be possible to arrive at a clinical benefit
25  with a diet which is outside these traditional ratios provided that the fat content contains
    suitable levels of decanoic acid according to the present invention.
    If the invention is delivered as part of a ketogenic diet, the ratio or total fat content can be
    altered during therapy to achieve nutritional goals and to optimize clinical benefit. The ratio
    can be in the range of 1.0:1, 1.5:1, 2.0:1, 2.5:1, 3.0:1, 3.5:1, 4.0:1, 4.5:1 or 5.0:1.
30  In one embodiment the ratio is 2.25:1 to 3.9:1.      In another embodiment the ratio is 2.26 to
    3.8:1 or 2.7-3.4:1. In further embodiments the ratio is 3.21:1, 3.23:1, 3.24:1, 3.25:1, 3.26:1,
    3.27:1, 3.28:1 or 3.29:1.
                                                     7

    It should be borne in mind that two different individuals of the same age and weight may
    experience a different level of clinical benefit on the same ratio or quantity of fat. Thus a
    clinician may wish to alter the ratio to achieve the optimum clinical benefit. Thus fine tuning
    the ratio or total fat content and altering it at the start and end of therapy, and during the
  5 therapy, e.g. to increase compliance, is within the scope of the invention.
    Decanoic acid occurs naturally in e.g. coconut oil and palm kernel oil and it can be
    envisaged that these products could form the key basis of the diet.              In general terms
    decanoic acid forms around 5 to 8% of the fatty acid composition of coconut oil. Thus one
    can envisage a food composition in which the fatty acid composition comprises from about 5
 .0 to 8 % of decanoic acid. Conversely octanoic acid comprises around 4.6 to 10% of the fatty
    acid composition of coconut oil. Since the present invention has identified that C8 is less
    beneficial than C10, one can envisage a food composition which the fatty acid composition
    comprises less than 10%, ideally less than 4.6% of octanoic acid.
    It will be appreciated that the lipid fraction useful in the present invention can be in the form
 .5 of triglycerides, diacyl-glycerides, monoacyl-glycerides, phospholipids, lyso-phospholipids,
    cholesterol and glycolipids, with triglycerides being generally preferred.
    One can envisage the situation where the C10 is delivered to a patient as a blended product.
    In this case it will be appreciated that according to the present invention the amount of
    saturated fatty acids utilised is relatively high. In particular it is preferably between 23 and
 .0 50, more preferably 25-45, and even more preferably 33-44 g per 100 g lipids, on fatty acid
    basis. The saturated fatty acids have 8 to 24 carbon atoms. It is preferred that a major part
    of the saturated fatty acids is decanoic acid (C10:0). Decanoic acid thus provides e.g. 15-50,
    preferably 18-45, more preferably 23-44 g per 100 g lipids. A particular embodiment
    comprises 30-37 g decanoic acid per 100 g lipids. Coconut oil or palm oil is a preferred
25  source for at least 50%, preferably between 70 and 90 of the lipid fraction. The remainder of
    the lipid fraction can be selected from e.g. medium-chain triglyceride sources such as
    fractionated coconut oil, macadamia oil, palm oil or palm kernel oil, or long-chain triglyceride
    sources such as safflower oil, sesame seed oil, soy oil (which may be obtained from
    soybean), sunflower oil, high oleic sunflower oil, corn oil, canola oil, walnut oil, evening
30  primrose oil, peanut oil, cottonseed oil, rapeseed oil, olive oil, fish oil, palm olein or algal oil,
    or mixtures thereof, preferably soybean oil (preferably between 2 and 30), medium-chain
    triglycerides (with fatty acids having 8-12 carbon atoms; between 0 and 14), marine oils
    (preferably between 0 and 14 wt. %, more preferably between 2 and 12 wt. %), and
    phospholipids, mono- and di-glycerides.
                                                     8

    The present invention preferably does not include mono-unsaturated and/or polyunsaturated
    fatty acids.    However, if present the amount of mono-unsaturated fatty acids is suitably
    between 25 and 48, preferably 28-43, more preferably 30-40 g per 100 g lipids (fatty acid
    basis).    If present, the amount of polyunsaturated fatty acids (i.e. having two or more
  5 unsaturated bonds), to which the trans fatty acids have been excluded, is 16-40, preferably
    20-30 g per 100 g lipids. It is preferred that the lipid fraction also comprises omega.-3
    polyunsaturated fatty. In particular, the polyunsaturated fatty acids comprise more than 0.5,
    preferably 1.0-10 wt. %. The amount of trans fatty acids is below 20, preferably 0-10, more
    preferably 0.2-4 g per 100 g lipids.
 .0 MCT oil is a food grade oil generally comprising more than 90 wt% fatty acids. Traditionally
    these fatty acids have been made up of saturated fatty acids having 8, 10 or 12 carbon
    atoms. Whilst MCT oil may have application in the present invention, preferred is the use of
    MCT based oil in which the majority of the saturated fatty acids are decanoic acid.
    Preferably decanoic acid represents at least 51%, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95 or 100
 .5 wt% of the fatty acid content of the composition useful in the present invention.
    In one embodiment of the composition useful in the present invention the ratio of the
    saturated fatty acids of C10 to C8 is 60:40, 65:35, 70:30, 75:25, 80:20, 85:15, 90:10, 95:5 or
    100:0.
    LCT oil is defined as a food grade oil that comprises 15% of fatty acids having 20 or more
  0 carbon atoms. The present invention may utilise an LCT oil, but preferably at a level of 1%,
    0.5% or 0.1% or less per 100 g.
    In general terms, administration of the composition of C10 of the present invention may be
    by an oral route or another route into the gastro-intestinal tract or by parenteral routes. The
    forms for these modes of administration may include conventional forms, either as liquid
25  solutions or suspensions, solid forms suitable for solution or suspension in liquid prior to
    injection, or as emulsions.
    Thus, the composition of C10 of the present invention can be formulated in a suitable form,
    which may be a dosage form. The form is generally suitable for oral administration, but the
    invention is also applicable to gastric tube feeding.      Suitable forms may include tablets,
30  dragees, capsules, gel caps, powders, granules, solutions, emulsion, suspension, coated
    particles, spray-dried particles and pills, which contain the composition of C10 of the present
    invention, and optionally one or more suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. In some
    embodiments the composition of C10 can be inserted or mixed into a food substance. In
                                                     9

    some embodiments the composition of C10 of the present invention is in the form of a
    nutritional product.    By nutritional product we generally refer to the situation where the
    substance intended to supplement a diet; although in the present situation the composition
    may be in a form such that it is intended to be the sole item or a meal or diet, i.e. a so-called
  5 "complete" nutritional product. Thus, the present invention may be administered to subjects
    in the form of nutritional supplements, foods, beverages.         A preferred type of food is a
    medical food, e.g. a food which is in a formulation to be consumed under medical
    supervision and which is intended for the specific dietary management of a disease or
    condition, such as in the ketogenic diet referred to above.
 .0 As mentioned above, the present invention may be realised in the form of a product which is
    suitable for complete nourishment of human beings, or as an oil emulsion or supplement or
    any other convenient product form. The product may be suitable for infants, children and
    adults. The product as well as comprising a lipid fraction in accordance with the teachings of
    the present invention may optionally comprise a protein fraction, a fraction of digestible
 .5 carbohydrates, available and/or nonavailable carbohydrates, a nitrogen fraction and
    optionally, a vitamin fraction, a mineral/trace element fraction or other components as may
     be appropriate to provide a nutritional supplement or complete nutritional product.
    The protein fraction comprises preferably peptides larger than 8 amino acids, which can
     make the product unsuitable for parenteral administration, due to potential allergic reactions.
  0  It is preferred to select proteins, which have strong emulgating properties, such as certain
    caseins. However, products usable for reconstitution in water or liquid formula should
     preferably contain lysolecithin, tartaric esters or combinations thereof as stabilization system
     in order to obtain a product that is suitable for drinking.
    The product may preferably be solid or semi-solid, such as a powder, bar, pudding, etcetera.
25  A semi-solid product is understood to be a product having a solid content of more than 40 g
    per 100 g ready to use product. More preferably the semi-solids are supplied as powder,
    which can be reconstituted in water to be used as a single, complete food. The powder may
    comprise of primary particles, agglomerated primary particles or mixtures of particles of
    various size. Such powders can be manufactured using methods known in the art, such as
30  spray drying.      Spray drying is     preferred when aids are       used to improve flowing
    characteristics. The product may also be in the form of an oil which could be used for frying
    etc.
                                                      10

    The dry product may be at least partly soluble in water, so as to allow ready make-up of a
    liquid food, if desired. Preferably at least 50 wt %, more preferably at least 75 wt % of the dry
    mass is soluble when dissolved as 10% (w/v) in water at 200C.
    The amount of digestible carbohydrates is 0-9, preferably 3.2-9, more preferably 4-8.6, even
  5 more preferably 5-8.2 g per 100 g dry mass. The amount of protein is 5-20, preferably 13-20,
    more preferably 13-18, more preferably 13.8-17, even more preferably 14.2-16.2 g per 100 g
    dry mass. The amount of lipids is 0, 0.1-100 g per 100 g dry mass, but may be 60-80, 63-75,
    or 65-72 g per 100 g dry mass.
    The inclusion of alpha-lactalbumin or ingredients which comprise high amounts of protein,
 .0 are particularly suitable. The presence of more than 20 wt % alpha-lactalbumin in the protein
    fraction of the product results in easy compliance with the requirements for leucine, lysine,
    methionine and cysteine, excellent palatability and digestion properties. Preferably more
    than 20%, more preferably 40-80 wt % of the protein fraction consists of alpha-lactalbumin.
    The digestible carbohydrate fraction can comprise food grade ingredients such as glucose
 .5 syrup, maltodextrins, lactose, sucrose, galactose, ribose, etc. Though excellent products can
    be obtained in terms of efficacy when several of the other technical features as disclosed in
    this description are applied, best results in terms of avoidance of side effects and efficacy
    are obtained if the digestible carbohydrate fraction takes a specific form. It appears
    beneficial if at least 20%, preferably 30-90% of the digestible carbohydrate fraction is formed
  0 by a source of galactose or ribose. Lactose is considered as suitable ingredient for this
    purpose. In particular oxidative stress will decrease, when such ketogenic formula is
    consumed, which comprises such non-glucose digestible carbohydrates.               Digestibility is
    determined by applying the Englyst 1999 method.
    The proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates preferably originate from at least two different
25  sources, for example, the proteins at least partly from animal, especially milk, source, but
    optionally also partly from plant source, the lipids at least partly from vegetal source, and the
    carbohydrates at least partly from milk source, or from a combination of milk (lactose) and
    plant (glucose, maltodextrins etc.).
    The amount of micro ingredients follow recommendations. However, increasing the amounts
30  of several specific ingredients above recommendations improves efficacy and prevents side
    effects in paediatric epileptics.
    In order to maintain normal development and growth, the energy requirement may be
    calculated according to an individual's energy requirements.          Useful products for feeding

   patients, particularly paediatric epileptic patients, have an energy density of 3.8-12.6 kJ/ml
   preferably 4.6-8.4 kJ/ml and more preferably 5.0-7.2 kJ/ml. An energy density of 5.4-6.7
   kJ/ml appears particularly useful when nourishing completely with the product. When the
   energy density of the liquid formula is 8.4-12.6 kJ/ml, the product may also be useful for
 5 intermediate fortification of the patient.
   The product usefully is relatively energy dense. In some embodiments, it provides 2520
   3780, or say 2520-3080, and preferably 2800-3040 kJ per 100 grams dry matter. The diet
   may provide 2500-3100 kJ per 100 grams dry matter, such as 2505, 2510, 2515, 2520,
   2525, 2530, 2535 or 2540 to 3100, 3095, 3090, 3085 or 3080 kJ per 100 g. In a particularly
.0 preferred embodiment the diet comprises 2984, 2985, 2986, 2987, 2988, 2989 or 2990 kJ
   per 100 g.
   The product, suitably after reconstitution to a liquid product, can be administered in an
   amount of between 50 and 200, preferably between 75 and 150 g per day, calculated as dry
   mass, for infants younger than 12 months, following general energy consumption
.5 recommendations, like has been described in the guidelines of the health authorities.      For
   older children, the preferred daily amount calculated on dry mass is between 100 and 360,
   especially between 150 and 300 g. For adults these amounts are 100-500, most preferably
   150-340 g for providing most ketogenic potential, and at the same time a sufficient amount of
   essential amino acids, carbohydrate skeletons, and other nutrients and being well tolerated
.0 and safe.

35  Experimental Examples
    Brief Experimental Approach
    Mitochondrial enrichment was estimated by evaluation of citrate synthase activity (corrected
    for total cellular protein content). This enzyme is localised at the mitochondria, comprises
    part of the TCA cycle and is commonly used as a marker of mitochondrial enrichment.
40
                                                   16

    In order to gain further independent insight into mitochondrial function, the activity of the
    respiratory chain enzyme, Complex 1, was also evaluated.
    A human neuroblastoma cell line (SH-SY5Y) was utilised throughout this study, except
  5 where stated. In brief, cells were exposed to a range (50 - 300 pM, dissolved in 0.5%
    DMSO) of either octanoic or decanoic acid concentrations.        After 6 days, the cells were
    harvested and citrate synthase activity was determined. Activity was expressed as
    nmol/min/mg of cellular protein.
 .0 In a second experiment, cells were exposed to decanoic acid (250 pM, dissolved in 0.5%
    DMSO) for 6 days. The cells were subsequently harvested, and the activity of Complex I
    was determined. Each experiment was repeated 5 times, and the activity was expressed as
    nmol/min/mg of cellular protein.
 .5 Additionally, SH-SY5Y cells were prepared for electron microscopy (EM) analysis to assess
    mitochondrial density and morphology following treatment with decanoic acid.
    Finally, the effect of decanoic acid was validated in an independent cell line. Primary cultures
    of human fibroblasts were exposed to decanoic acid at a concentration of 250 pM for 6 days.
 .0 Following the incubation, citrate synthase activity was again assessed.
    Results
25  Octanoic acid had no effect on the parameters studied. However, exposure of the SH-SY5Y
    cells to decanoic but not octanoic acid resulted in an increase in citrate synthase activity
    when compared to control cells (incubated with vehicle only). This effect was dose
    dependent (Fig 1), with a maximum, highly significant (p<0.001), 30% increase occurring at
    a concentration of 250 pM (expressed as nmol/min/mg cell protein):

                      Control (n=8)                               Decanoic Acid (n=8)

    Determination of Complex I activity in SH-SY5Y cells also revealed a significant (p < 0.002)
    increase with respect to the control experiment, following treatment with decanoic acid (Fig
    2). A significant (p < 0.05) increase in Complex I activity was still apparent when the data
                                                   17

    were normalised against citrate synthase activity (Fig 3). Normalisation takes into account
    the mitochondrial enrichment following administration of decanoic acid. The Complex
    I:citrate synthase activity ratio therefore provides a more accurate demonstration of
    mitochondrial function independently of mitochondrial content.
  5
    In all cases, the addition of 0.5% DMSO was shown to have no effect on the parameters
    studied, i.e. when compared to untreated cells.
    The electron microscopy study revealed increased numbers of mitochondria in cells treated
 .0 with 250 pM decanoic acid (Fig 4). The mitochondria are clearly visible in both images as
    dark circular and elongated organelles present in the cytoplasm. Treatment with decanoic
    acid also appears to alter the morphology of the mitochondria, with the more intense staining
    potentially resulting from more dense cristae within the organelles. These observations are
    supported by a quantitative analysis (Fig 5) of the EM data, which reveals a significant (p <
 .5 0.002) increase in the number of mitochondria per cell.
    Finally, the data were validated by the observation that primary human fibroblasts exposed
    to decanoic acid (250 pM) also revealed a 45% increase in citrate synthase activity.
 .0 Conclusions
    At a concentration relevant to that achieved in the plasma by patients on the ketogenic diet,
    decanoic acid exposure resulted in a marked increase in citrate synthase activity in treated
    SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. Activity of this enzyme is known to correlate with cellular
25  mitochondrial levels, therefore these findings raise the possibility that decanoic acid
    exposure leads to an alteration in cellular mitochondrial function, potentially by increasing
    mitochondrial content. This conclusion is further supported by independent data derived from
    EM-based direct observation of cellular mitochondrial content. Additionally, Complex I
    activity was observed      to increase following administration     of decanoic acid.    This
30  mitochondrial respiratory enzyme is a direct marker of mitochondrial function, therefore this
    data independently suggests an increase in mitochondrial function results from incubation
    with decanoic acid. Notably, these findings do not appear to be restricted to one cell type
    since a similar phenomenon, with regards to increased citrate synthase activity, was
    apparent in primary human fibroblast cells exposed to decanoic acid.

  This action of decanoic acid may therefore prove to be of therapeutic benefit for those
  patients with epilepsies that are responsive to the ketogenic diet. Similarly, for patients with
  inherited or acquired mitochondrial disorders, decanoic acid may also be beneficial. With
  regards to acquired disorders, this could include diabetes and neurodegenerative conditions
5 such as Parkinson's disease and dementias including Alzheimer's disease.
  It will be appreciated that any of the ranges disclosed herein may be used in suitable
  combinations.
