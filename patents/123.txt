                 COLLATERAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM AND METHOD
                                RELATED APPLICATIONS
[0001]          This application claims priority to provisional application Serial No. 61/157,962
       filed on March 6, 2009.        This application is a divisional application of Australian
       application no. <removed-apn>, which is a divisional application of 2010221462, the
       disclosures of both of which are incorporated herein by reference.
                                        TECHNICAL FIELD
[0002]          Embodiments of the invention are related generally to systems and methods for
       facilitating collateral management in the financial industry.
                              BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
[0003]          Currently, available collateral management systems are limited in multiple
       respects. Collateral refers to a security or a physical asset that can be pledged to secure
       repayment of what one party owes another party. Most collateral management systems
       include discrete platforms for operating on different types of collateral assets, such as
       securities or cash or for different obligation types, such as repurchase agreements (repo)
       or derivatives.     Therefore, to manage different types of collateral and obligations, a
       participant may be required to access multiple platforms through discrete user interfaces,
       systems, reporting, etc. Excessive manual intervention is typically required in eligibility,
       allocation, and reconciliation processes.
[0004]          Furthermore, existing collateral management systems typically only account for
       fresh    collateral  and   single  instances  of rehypothecation     or collateral             re-use.
                                                                                 10138715 1 (GHMatters) P87900.AU.2

             Rehypothecation is the ability to re-use assets that one has received as collateral against
             an obligation of one's own. Existing systems do not have the capability for multiple
             rehypothecations of collateral.
[0005]                     One known system for collateral management is disclosed in U.S. Patent
             application No. 7,480,632 to Fudali et al., which is hereby incorporated by reference.
             Fudali discloses a process for allocating specific assets from a pool of assets to secure a
             liability. Information concerning each of the assets in the pool of assets is received from
             at least two sources. A set of validation rules is applied to the information for each asset
             in the pool of assets and those assets not meeting the validation rules are rejected. A price
             is assigned to each non-rejected asset. A subset of the non-rejected assets is allocated to
             the liability as a function to collateralize the liability.
[0006]                     The system of Fudali is a basic system that does not handle rehypothecation. The
             system of Fudali further does not include multiple selectable pre-defined types of
             allocation runs.        Other drawbacks and deficiencies are inherent in Fudali and other
             existing collateral allocation systems.
[0007]                     Thus, a solution is needed that provides a fully automated, collateral eligibility
             and allocation management system that allows for re-use and for multiple asset types.
             The system should be operable regardless of the type of underlying obligation.
                                          SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
[0008]                     In one aspect of the invention, a computer implemented collateral management
             system is provided for managing collateral of multiple participants including borrowers
             and lenders. The system comprises a global long box available to each borrower, each
                                                            2
10138715 1 (GHMatters) P87900.AU.2

             global long box configured for storing all types of available assets possessed by each
             borrower. The system additionally includes an eligibility database storing eligibility and
             concentration limits, the concentration limits defined by lender rules controlling the
             acceptability of the available assets for use as collateral, the value of the assets, and
             overall acceptable composition of assets. The system additionally includes an interactive
             participant interface accepting collateral use preferences from the borrowers, the
             collateral            use preferences including, lender  ranking  components,  asset ranking
             components, and allocation run type selection components for facilitating collateral
             allocation.              The system additionally includes an allocation engine implementing
             computer processing components for selecting an allocation sequence based on the
             collateral use preferences of the borrowers and in compliance the stored eligibility and
             concentration limits in the eligibility database and allocating collateral from each global
             long box in the selected sequence.
[0009]                     In an additional aspect of the invention, a computer-implemented method is
             provided for managing collateral of multiple participants including borrowers and
             lenders.             The method comprises maintaining a global long box available to each
             borrower, wherein each global long box configured for storing all available types of
             assets possessed by each borrower. The method additionally includes storing eligibility
             and concentration limits in an eligibility database, the concentration limits defined by
             lender rules controlling the acceptability of the available assets for use as collateral, the
             value of the assets, and overall acceptable composition of assets.        The method further
             includes accepting collateral use preferences through an interactive participant interface
             from borrowers, the collateral use preferences including, lender ranking components,
                                                             3

             asset ranking components, and allocation run type selection components for facilitating
             collateral allocation. The method further includes selecting, using an allocation engine
             implementing computer processing components, an allocation sequence based on the
             collateral use preferences of the borrowers and in compliance the stored eligibility and
             concentration limits in the eligibility database, and allocating collateral using the
             allocation engine implementing computer processing components in accordance with the
             selected sequence.
[0010]                     In yet an additional aspect of the invention, a computer-implemented method is
             provided for managing collateral of multiple participants including borrowers and
             lenders, the method comprising maintaining a global long box available to each borrower,
             each global long box configured for storing all available types of assets possessed by
             each borrower, and storing eligibility and concentration limits in an eligibility database.
             The concentration limits are defined by lender rules controlling the acceptability of the
             available assets for use as collateral, the value of the assets, and overall acceptable
             composition of assets and the eligibility and concentration limits include parameters
             established for the requirement of acceptable collateral by lenders including eligible types
             of collateral and an amount of collateral.         The method additionally includes accepting
             collateral use preferences through an interactive participant interface from the borrowers,
             the collateral use preferences including, lender ranking components, asset ranking
             components, and allocation run type selection components for facilitating collateral
             allocation.           The method further includes selecting, using an allocation       engine
             implementing computer processing components, a collateral allocation sequence selected
             based on the collateral use preferences of the borrowers and in compliance the stored
                                                            4
10138715 1 (GHMatters) P87900.AU.2

             eligibility and concentration limits in the eligibility database.          The selected allocation
             sequence includes at least one of: an optimization allocation sequence including either
             allocating to achieve best coverage of assets or allocating to achieve best value for assets;
             a top up allocation sequence including the steps of keeping existing positions locked and
             allocating only unallocated assets from the borrower global long box; and a minimum
             movements allocation sequence including the step of calculating an optimal allocation
             based on a minimum amount of asset movement. The method further includes allocating
             collateral using an allocation engine implementing computer processing components for
             allocating collateral from each global long box in the selected sequence.

                            DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
[0024]                     Embodiments of the present invention are directed to a collateral management
             system that operates across multiple products and implements multiple types of selectable
             allocation runs.           The collateral management system incorporates a rehypothecation
             engine for re-using received collateral that allows lenders to generate returns on held
             assets rather than holding a long inventory. For borrowers, the rehypothecation engine
             facilitates collateral upgrade trades.
[0025]                     A goal of collateral allocation is to allocate securities as collateral from
             participant long boxes and collateral accounts to lender collateral accounts, both
                                                              6
10138715 1 (GHMatters) P87900.AU.2

             maximizing the rehypothecation of received collateral and optimizing the use of
             borrower's own, fresh collateral.          The allocation system may, in embodiments of the
             invention, have functionality similar to that described in commonly owned U.S. Patent
             No. 7,480,632 to Fudali et al, which is hereby incorporated by reference. However, the
             allocation system in accordance with embodiments of the invention includes improved
             and enhanced functionality, which will be explained in detail below.
[0026]                     FIG. 1 is a block diagram illustrating an operating environment for global
             collateral management system 200 in accordance with an embodiment of the invention.
             The global collateral management system 200 may be operated by a financial institution
              100. The financial institution 100 and global collateral management system 200 may be
             connected over a network 50 with system participants.              The system participants may
             include borrower participants 10a..10n, lender/borrower participants 20a... 20n, and
             lender participants        30a... 30n.    Participants   are enrolled in the global collateral
             management system 200 and are actively involved in collateral management.
[0027]                     Borrower participants 10a... IOn are collateral providers and lender participants
             30a... 30n are collateral          receivers.     Lender/borrower   participants 20a... 20n are
             participants          who both receive     collateral  and provide   collateral.      Thus,  the
             lender/borrower participants 20a... 20n re-introduce assets that they have received in their
             role as lenders. Lender/borrower participants 20a... 20n enrolled in the system actively
             re-use assets received through the lending business.           Despite the fact that in order to
             participate, parties must be enrolled in the system, the financial institution or other
             organization operating the collateral management system 200 can operate on assets that it
                                                             7
10138715 1 (GHMatters) P87900.AU.2

             does not hold as long as the parties grant contractual control over the assets. Storage of
             the assets will be further described below with reference to FIG. 2.
[0028]                     Network 50 may include various networks in accordance with embodiments of
             the invention, including a wired or wireless local area network (LAN) and a wide area
             network (WAN), wireless personal area network (PAN) and other types of networks.
             When used in a LAN networking environment, computers may be connected to the LAN
             through a network interface or adapter.            When used in a networking environment,
             computers may include a communication mechanism. Communication devices may be
             internal or external, and may be connected to the system bus via the user-input interface,
             or other appropriate mechanism.         Computers may be connected over the Internet, an
             Intranet, Extranet, Ethernet, or any other system that provides communications.         Some
             suitable communications protocols may include TCP/IP, UDP, or OSI for example. For
             wireless communications, communications protocols may include Bluetooth, Zigbee,
             IrDa or other suitable protocol.            Furthermore, components of the system may
             communicate through a combination of wired or wireless paths.
[0029]                     FIG. 2 is a block diagram illustrating the global collateral management system
             200 in accordance with an embodiment of the invention.                   The global collateral
             management system 200 is shown as including a rehypothecation engine 202, a
             projection and simulation system 206, eligibility rules database               210, reporting
             components 212, a pre-allocation engine 220, a post allocation engine 230, a collateral
             allocation system 240, front end interactive components 250, and participant/asset data
             270.         All of the aforementioned components may communicate over a network 260.
                                                           8
10138715 1 (GHMatters) P87900.AU.2

             Alternatively, the components may be integrated or may communicate over multiple
             networks.
[0030]                     The rehypothecation engine 202 is described in greater detail in co-pending
             application PCT US09/52420, which has been incorporated herein by reference.                  In
             summary, rehypothecation refers to the reuse of collateral received from one counterparty
             to satisfy the collateral requirements from another counterparty.           Thus, participating
             collateral receivers have the capability to become lender/borrowers or rehypothecators
             because they are given the ability to use collateral they have received to meet collateral
             obligations they may have where they are a collateral provider.
[0031]                     The projection and simulation system 206 performs hypothetical allocation runs
             to allow borrowers and lenders to view a post allocation snapshot given hypothetical
             preferences for lenders, assets, types of allocation runs, etc.           The projections and
             simulation system 206 does not perform an actual allocation and instead merely serves as
             a valuable informational tool for system participants.
[0032]                     The eligibility rules database 210 may include rules input both by lenders and
             borrowers regarding eligibility of assets for allocation.       Eligibility parameters are the
             parameters established to identify acceptable collateral. The parties specify the types of
             collateral they are willing to accept or allocate.         Furthermore, the eligibility rules
             database 210 may include concentration limits established by lenders.            Concentration
             limits specify the quantity or percentage of that collateral in relation to the outstanding
             required value (RQV) or issue amount to be met with collateral from the borrower. The
             participants may have the ability to specify, where appropriate, a number of shares as the
             concentration limit in addition to the ability to specify by amount (in any currency) or by
                                                            9
10138715 1 (GHMatters) P87900.AU.2

             percentage. Furthermore, in embodiments of the invention, lenders have the ability to
             specify concentration limits on a number of factors including line, country, region,
             issuer, industry sector, issue rating, issuer rating, maturity range, and asset type.     The
             capability may also be provided to specify concentration limits per deal (which may
             include an individual loan), cross deal, cross account, and cross counterparty account.
[0033]                     The reporting components 212 may generate and provide participants with a
             variety of reports.         The reports may include, for example, a headroom report, which
             illustrates how much further borrowing the borrower's remaining assets would support.
             The reports may further include information pertaining to unutilised concentration limits
             which the borrower can specifically target by bringing in relevant assets. Reports may
             further enable participants to have the ability to trace back the settings that dictate
             whether a specific asset has been deemed eligible or ineligible and has been allocated to a
             specific lender and also if the concentration limit was breached and what limit was
             breached. The reporting components 212 may further provide an optimisation matrix,
             which facilitates the efficiency of collateral providers. Using this information, borrowers
             can determine which asset would be the most optimal portfolio to meet their lender
             commitments.            Furthermore, after an allocation run has completed, the reporting
             components 212 may produce a report that articulates which assets are ineligible across
             the entire lender universe. Such a report allows borrowers to group assets logically so
             that they can negotiate eligibility with their lenders.
[0034]                     Users will also have access to real-time self-service reporting and inquiry
             management.           So that service representatives may be fully utilized, the platform will
             provide these representatives with a remote desktop capability so that the representatives

             can see the interface.         The user interface is designed to enable participant initiation of
             transactions and simplified viewing of activity. The reporting may encompass eligibility
             schedules, real and hypothetical allocations. Other reports useful to system participants
             may also be generated.
[0035]                     The participant/asset data 270 may include information accessed by the allocation
             system to determine an appropriate allocation of assets. Such information may include,
             for example, asset locations, global long box information, external long box information,
             notional long box information, and other information relevant to user assets and the
             location of the assets.           Within the collateral management system, the storage of
             participant/asset data 270 may be or include a global long box, which that permits
             aggregation of cash and securities collateral balances for a participant across regions and
             collateral management products. The global long box serves as a custody or holding
             account into which assets are delivered for eventual allocation, whether this be for real or
             hypothetical.         The stored collateral may be allocated or available, already in the host
             system or on its way in, or pledged to counterparties of participants and held outside the
             host system.          The global long box is agnostic of underlying custody platform or asset
             class.        For example, the assets may include stocks, loans, structured deals, repurchase
             agreements, or secured credit lines.
[0036]                     The participant/asset data 270 may also include a notional long box, which is not
             a physical long box, but a representation of a long box for housing assets that have been
             allocated from different borrowers, so that these assets can be used by participants for
             rehypothecation.         The participant/asset data 270 may further include or access escrow
             accounts held by participants             and independent third parties.      Additionally, the
                                                            11

             participant/asset data may include or access external long boxes held outside of the
             collateral management system. Furthermore, the participant/asset data may include or
             access one or more shared long boxes jointly owned by participants or other legal
             entities.
[0037]                     In embodiments of the invention, the global long box stores both external and
             internal assets and allows participants to view both sets of assets. Participants may be
             able to access both internal and external assets through the global long box or
             alternatively, while being able to view both internal and external assets, the participants
             may be restricted to access internal assets only.         Access to external assets may be
             provided through an alternative interface. In yet further embodiments of the invention,
             internal and external assets may be both stored and accessed through separate long boxes,
             both accessible to the collateral management system.
[0038]                     The pre-allocation engine 220 controls pre-allocation activity. The allocations
             process is to be preceded by pre-allocation activity, which is necessary for bringing in
             external assets and hypothetical assets. The pre-allocation engine captures a pre
             allocation snapshot in order to value the existing collateral at the current market prices.
             The pre-allocation engine may further conduct a threshold tolerance check and a
             minimum transfer amount check to ensure that the allocation run can be conducted.
             Other pre-allocation activities include checking for a simulation run and upon the finding
             of a simulation, retrieving hypothetical assets. If the pre-allocation engine confirms that
             the run is not a simulation run, the next steps are to lock collateral accounts and to lock
             collateral credit lines. This is to be followed by the check to see what variation of run is
             requested.

[0039]                     The post allocation engine 230 operates upon completion of the allocation run to
             record a post-allocation snapshot.            This is to be followed by netting, where the
             differences between the pre and post allocation snapshots are to be evaluated, thus
             identifying the potential movements of assets.
[0040]                     The collateral allocation system 240 includes components implemented during an
             allocation run. The collateral allocation system 240 is illustrated in greater detail in FIG.
             3.      The front end interactive components 250 provide system participants with a user
             interface for selecting parameters such as eligibility constraints and allocation run types.
             The front end interactive components 250 further provide borrowers with the ability to
             view meaningful long box representations. The front end interactive components 250 are
             illustrated in greater detail with reference to FIG. 4.
[0041]                     FIG. 3 is a block diagram illustrating a collateral allocation system 300 in
             accordance with an embodiment of the invention. The collateral allocation system 300
             may include stored allocation procedures 330 executed by a computer processor in order
             to allocate assets. The stored allocation procedures 330 may include allocation by lender
             332, allocation by asset 334, best value 336, best coverage 338, full optimization 340,
             top-up, 342, and minimum movements 344. The collateral allocation system 300 may
             additionally include run type determination components 310, run execution components
             320, and eligibility verification components 350.
[0042]                     In operation, the run type determination components 310 may access stored
             procedures based on preferences stored in the eligibility database as verified by the
             eligibility verification components. Run execution components 320 may be implemented
             to combine or integrate selected procedures for executing an allocation run.
                                                            13
10138715 1 (GHMatters) P87900.AU.2

[0043]                     All of the aforementioned allocation procedures may be selected by borrowers
             based on personal preference. Allocation by lender procedures 332 and allocation by
             asset procedures 334 may be selected by the borrower based on personal preferences. In
             allocation by lender procedures 332, the first step may be lender selection. The ordering
             of the lenders will be influenced by any selections that the borrower has made to
             highlight some lenders who are to be allocated at a priority, and the goal of the run (e.g.
             whether best coverage, best value, etc.) Allocation by lender is further described with
             reference to Fig. 9 below.
[0044]                     The allocation by asset procedure 334 first selects a pool of assets. The ordering
             of the pools is driven by the borrower's prioritisation.          Allocation by asset is further
             described below with reference to Fig. 8.
[0045]                     In order to achieve full optimisation with optimization procedures 340, the
             borrower will be able to specify the goal of the run in accordance with either best value
             procedures 336 or best coverage procedures 338.
[0046]                     With best value procedures 336, the asset could be allocated first to the lender that
             values it the highest, and then to other lenders, moving in descending order of value
             given to the asset. Optimisation with the goal of achieving best value entails covering the
             accounts while obtaining best value for the assets (e.g. lowest haircuts is the primary
             consideration, and coverage is the second.)         Haircuts refer to the practice of valuing an
             asset at a percentage of market value as perceived by the collateral receiver due to market
             volatility. In embodiments of the invention, for best value procedures 336, borrowers
             may select one or more lenders to be allocated at a priority and the remainder of the
             lenders may be addressed by the optimized best value procedures in which the system
                                                           14
10138715 1 (GHMatters) P87900.AU.2

             attempts to cover the accounts while obtaining best value for the assets.             Thus, for
             optimized best value procedures, obtaining lowest haircuts is the primary consideration
             and coverage is secondary. In the absence of lender selections, lenders are automatically
             ranked so as to achieve this goal.
[0047]                     Best coverage procedures 338 aim to achieve 100% lender account coverage from
             the existing asset pool. When implementing best coverage procedures 338, coverage is
             primary and value is secondary. The priority is to use all of the borrower's existing asset
             pool as collateral.        In an optimized scenario, lenders are automatically ranked by the
             system so as to achieve this goal.
[0048]                     For top up run procedures 342, specific accounts can be collateralized using only
             long box positions including external long boxes, while not disturbing accounts that have
             already been collateralised. For the top up run allocation runs, long box positions are
             retrieved, and assets are locked in escrow accounts. A top up run is a type of allocation
             run that keeps existing positions locked in place and allocates from the long box.
[0049]                     With minimum movements procedures 344, the goal is to achieve collateralisation
             of the deals while requiring a minimum number of movements.                    Thus, minimum
             movements procedures calculate the best allocation based on the minimum amount of
             movements to assets.
[0050]                     In preferred embodiments, for all types of run procedures described above, the
             borrower will be able to prioritise, de-prioritise, include, or exclude external long boxes,
             and have the ability to include and exclude recalls and credit. In embodiments of the
             invention, these selections may be applied at a specified time of day or up to market cut
             off time.

[0051]                     FIG. 4 is a block diagram illustrating front end interactive components 400 in
             accordance with an embodiment of the invention.                  Via one or more user interfaces
             accessing the front end interactive components 400, system participants will be able to
             add assets easily and quickly to the global longbox.             Additionally, participants will be
             able to select through their interfaces, which assets they would like to allocate across and
             in what order. The allocation of assets is further configurable in that multiple runs can be
             performed, such that each run is specific to a product, or alternatively, a single run can be
             performed across all products.
[0052]                     The front end interactive components 400 may include eligibility selection
             components 410, run type selection components 420, simulation viewing and selection
             components 430, long box interactive viewing and management components 440,
             interactive ranking engine 450, and limit/threshold controller 460.
[0053]                     Eligibility selection components 410 may be available to both borrowers and
             lenders and may provide the opportunity for both counterparties to adjust eligibility
             settings.             The eligibility selection components 410 may allow lenders to specify
             eligibility criteria by detailing the assets that they will accept.          An interface may be
             provided to allow lenders to designate eligibility at a product level, so that certain assets
             may be considered ineligible across all participants. The eligibility selection components
             410 may provide lenders with self-service capability allowing them to set up eligibility
             schedules.             Alternatively or additionally, an interface may be provided through the
             financial institution at an administrative level in order to allow setup on behalf of the
             participant. Additionally, the eligibility selection components 410 allow borrowers to
             specify the assets that they would like to be considered as ineligible. Borrowers may
                                                              16
10138715 1 (GHMatters) P87900.AU.2

             designate individual assets or an entire class of instruments as ineligible or as unavailable
             to specific lenders. Both the borrowers and the lenders will be able to independently
             view the actual eligibility schedule that is in force, the pending changes, and for the
             pending changes, an indication of when they will be effective. A web and a graphical
             user interface will allow participants to view positions via the web and to input and
             manage the eligibility data across all collateral management products. From the user
             interface, the user may be able to make adjustments to eligibility criteria definitions
             during the trading day.
[0054]                     Furthermore, the eligibility selection components 410 may offer the self service
             capability for borrowers to lock assets to nominated accounts and for lenders to
             unilaterally lock account from movements, via self service, for specified time.            For
             example, lenders may want to restrict hours so as to eliminate movements after a
             specified time of day.
[0055]                     Run type selection components 420 are implemented to select a run-type based on
             input preferences.         Multiple run-types are described above with reference to FIG. 3.
             These run types may, in some instances be combined.                In embodiments in which
             customized run types are available, the opportunity to customize is provided through the
             run type selection components 420.
[0056]                     Simulation viewing and selection components 430 provide the ability to carry out
             simulations to enable borrowers to execute runs that mirror actual runs without
             performing actual physical movements. Having the ability to view results in advance of
             the movements provides a useful instructional borrower tool. In preferred embodiments
             of the invention, after completing a simulation run, the borrower is to be able to execute
                                                            17
10138715 1 (GHMatters) P87900.AU.2

             based on the settings for the simulation by simply instructing the system to apply the
             simulation settings through the simulation viewing and selection components 430. The
             simulation viewing and selection components 430 may further provide a summary to
             participants showing the differences between the simulation runs and the actual runs. To
             further investigate issues that are highlighted in the summary, the borrower will be able
             to look into all transactions from an applicable long box.
[0057]                     Long box interactive viewing and management components 440 may provide a
             window into assets into long boxes, including external long boxes.             A view into the
             global long box would be able to show all assets stored in the global long box housed
             within the collateral management system that belong to a participant, across geography
             and across products.             External long boxes may be stored outside of the collateral
             management system.               However, participants may provide the collateral management
             system with access to these external long boxes both for allocation of collateral and for
             viewing.              The viewing capabilities further enhance selection capabilities that allow
             participants to have the flexibility to carry out allocation while including, excluding,
             prioritising, deprioritising, or mingling assets in one or many internal or external long
             boxes. Figs. 10 and 11, which will be described below provide further details of the long
             box interactive viewing components 440.
[0058]                     Interactive ranking engine 450 allows borrowers, who are the collateral providers,
             to use collateral types as the basis for assigning a relative quality of collateral or a
             borrower quality ranking "BQR".                 In preferred embodiments, borrowers have the
             capability to be able to update their ranking of assets intraday, and to allow multiple
                                                              18
10138715 1 (GHMatters) P87900.AU.2

             settings to be changed through the day. Thus, the borrower is successfully able to specify
             its own order for sorting the assets, thereby overriding any existing system default order.
[0059]                     Lenders, who are the collateral receivers, use the collateral type to define
             eligibility and may also associate concentration limits against them. Borrowers may be
             provided with the ability to rank assets from 'Allocate first' to 'Allocate last'.            The
             Borrower will typically want to allocate the lowest quality stock it has to lenders first and
             then move up the scale. In embodiments of the invention, borrower quality rankings
             range from 0.01 being the lowest and 99.99 being the highest.                       In additional
             embodiments, other ranking schemes may be implemented.                  The capability may be
             provided to drag and drop rankings through the user interface.
[0060]                     Limit/threshold controller 460 enables a threshold test that is based on the credit
             rating of a counterparty, to be used prior to allocation run.           In embodiments of the
             invention, concentration limits may fall into four groups including: (a) cross account
             group           concentration limits;  (b)  cross   account  concentration    limits;  (c) group
             concentration limits; and (d) concentration limits. All four of these limits can apply in
             turn.        The system evaluates each asset to ensure that the strictest of the limits is not
             broken and to ensure that none of these limits is broken individually. For example, a set
             of lender accounts could be part of a cross account group concentration limit. Once the
             group of accounts has reached its limit, then no more collateral can be allocated even
             though the individual accounts'            concentration limits have not been reached.        An
             additional check involves calculation of the amount of collateral that can be allocated.
             The system allocates the asset by board lot size while observing the concentration limits,
             calculates the collateral value of the asset it has allocated, and reduces the collateral total
                                                            19

             accordingly. The asset movement is recorded (i.e. source and destination accounts). The
             system further examines remaining assets by establishing if all of the holding has been
             allocated. If there is any holding in the asset remaining, it will be assessed against the
             next lender. A further check ensures that the RQV has been reached.
[0061]                     FIG. 5 is block diagram illustrating collateral flow between participants in
             accordance with an embodiment of the invention. A lender participant 520 having escrow
             522 is shown.         A borrower 510 stores assets in a long box 512, which in preferred
             embodiments of the invention is a global long box which stores assets across products
             and geographies.          The long box 512 may additionally include multiple long boxes
             including both internal and external long boxes.         The assets in the long box 512 are
             available as collateral to a lender/borrower participant 530.
[0062]                     The lender borrower 530 is a participant engaged in rehypothecation of assets.
             The lender borrower 530 may have both a long box 532 and a notional long box 534.
             The notional long box 534 is a pool of assets that is made up of the securities held in the
             lender/borrower's escrow accounts, i.e. those assets the borrower/lender participant 530
             has received as part of lending activity and is willing to re-use to satisfy its own
             borrowing obligations.         Borrower/lender participants 530 can decide which escrow
             accounts they wish to include in the notional long boxes 534. The notional long box 534
             contains all the re-usable assets for a given lender/borrower.        In embodiments of the
             invention, during rehypothecation, participants cannot re-use the same piece of collateral
             more than once.          Once a participant has enrolled, the system treats all the assets the
             participant has delivered as a single portfolio of assets. As set forth above, more detail on
             the rehypothecation is contained within related application PCT Application Serial No.

[0063]                     FIG. 6 is a flow chart illustrating the use of eligibility requirements during
             allocation in accordance with embodiments of the invention. In S600 eligibility activity
             is initiated.         Initial steps include the definition of eligibility criteria. In S602, the
             borrower specifies assets that it would like considered as ineligible. In S604, a definition
             is provided at a product level of assets that will be considered ineligible across all
             participants. This product level definition may be an internal system definition or may be
             established by the lender. The full functionality, described below, which is available to a
             lender for specifying eligibility criteria will also be available when specifying eligibility
             criteria at a product level. In S606, the lender will specify eligibility criteria, detailing the
             assets that it will accept. The lender will have self-service capability allowing it to set up
             eligibility schedules on its own. Alternatively, as shown in S608, lenders may provide
             specifications for system administrators who may execute the settings on behalf of the
             lenders.          Although described sequentially, steps 602, 604, and 606 may be performed
             simultaneously or in any order. Ultimately, both the borrower and the lender will be able
             to independently view the actual eligibility schedule established by these steps as well as
             the pending changes, and for the pending changes - an indication of when they will come
             into force. Furthermore, in embodiments of the invention, both the borrower and the
             lender will be provided with the option to provide an approval sign-off online. At each
             borrower-lender relationship level, the system provides the ability to control settings
             regarding approval sign-offs, which may not be required in all situations. S602, S604,
                                                            21

              S606, and S608 are preferably executed manually with user input and are followed by
             automated steps performed by the system as set forth below.
[0064]                     In S610, the system selects an asset.        Steps S612, S614, S616, and S618
             implement various checks against each selected asset. S612 checks to see if the lender
             accepts received rehypothecated assets.             S614 implements a check regarding evaluated
             prices. S616 checks regarding stale prices. Step 618 checks to see if the lender accepts
             borrower-priced assets.           Based on the outcome of these checks, the asset may be
             considered unacceptable or acceptable.
[0065]                     The system checks in S620 to determine if the asset is acceptable. If the asset is
             not acceptable in S620, it is to be marked as ineligible in S650 and a check made to see if
             any other assets are available in S656. If other assets are available in S656, the next asset
             is to be selected in S610 and the process started again. If no other assets are available, the
             process is to be ended in S660, the system having tested all available assets.
[0066]                     The selected asset is to be tested in S624 against the lenders and the borrowers
             criteria for excluded assets. In the above test, if the asset matches up with the list of
             excluded assets it is to be marked as ineligible as set forth above and a check made to see
             if any other assets are available. If other assets are available, the system selects the next
             asset and the process repeats. If no other assets are available, the process ends, having
             tested all available assets.
[0067]                     In the test of S624, if the asset does not match up with the list of excluded assets,
             the system tests against the criteria for eligible assets in S628. Based on the outcome of
             the test against the criteria for eligible assets, and on the setting for the underlying flag
             for the asset, a further test is to be conducted for underlying assets in S634 and S640. In
                                                              22
10138715 1 (GHMatters) P87900.AU.2

             some scenarios, whether the asset has passed or failed the test against the criteria for
             eligible assets, the test for underlying assets is to be carried out. However in other
             scenarios, only one of the tests of S634 and S640 may be necessary.
[0068]                     The outcome of the test for underlying assets would either be that the asset passes
             and is marked eligible in S642, or that the asset fails and it is marked ineligible in S650.
             In either case, the next step is to check if any other assets are available in S656. If other
             assets are available, the next asset is selected and the process starts again in S610. If no
             other assets are available, the process ends in S660, as all available assets have been
             tested.
[0069]                     The eligibility criteria will be specified using a rules based approach similar to the
             manner in which email users specify rules for managing incoming email. In a preferred
             embodiment, the rules are configured in a tree format, starting with an asset type, and
             descending multiple levels, with multiple forks en route, as further granularity is
             specified. A similar tree structure may also be used to specify concentration limits and
             haircuts. The rules based approach allows the participants to specify exactly what assets it
             will accept, without having to separately call out exclusions.
[0070]                     FIG. 7 is a flow chart illustrating an allocation process in accordance with an
             embodiment of the invention.              Each allocation is preceded by pre-allocation activity,
             which is necessary for bringing in external assets and hypothetical assets. When an
             allocation is requested in S700, a pre-allocation snapshot is captured in S702. The pre
             allocation snapshot shows the valuing of the existing collateral at the current market
             prices. To support the bi-lateral margining process of calling for margin, or difference
                                                              23
10138715 1 (GHMatters) P87900.AU.2

             between an account value and RQV, only if an agreed threshold is breached, a threshold
             tolerance check and a minimum transfer amount check are carried out in S704.
[0071]                     If the threshold is breached in S706, the system checks for a simulation run in
             S708. If the run is a simulation run, then the next step is to retrieve hypothetical assets in
             S716. Following the retrieval of hypothetical assets in S716, the system checks for type
             of run in S714. Simulation runs can be carried out for the top-up, minimum movements,
             and optimization runs, and in embodiments of the invention, simulation runs can be
             performed for rehypothecation.            In this instance, rehypothecation simulations will be
             independent for each participant and a simulation by one participant will not impact a
             simulation performed by another.             Regardless of the type of run, after completing a
             simulation run, the borrower will be able to execute based on the settings for the
             simulation run, except where hypothetical positions have been involved, in which case
             there it will be necessary to wait for the assets to be available.
[0072]                     If confirmed that the run is not a simulation run in S708, the next steps are to lock
             collateral accounts in S710 and to lock collateral credit lines in S712.             This is to be
             followed by the check to see what variation of run is requested in S714. Apart from the
             simulation run that has already been addressed, at least three basic run variations are
             provided as selectable options to the borrower. These selectable options, which were
             described in detail above with respect to FIG. 4, include at least, optimization, top up, and
             minimum movements runs.
[0073]                     After executing the optimization or minimum movement runs and flushing back
             assets and unwinding automatically created credit in S718, the system covers negative
             settled positions in S724. Furthermore, if a top up run is performed, the system retrieves
                                                             24
10138715 1 (GHMatters) P87900.AU.2

             long box positions in S720 and locks assets in escrow in S722 before negative settled
             positions are covered in S724. The system then addresses negative settled positions in
             S724 by placing assets in the lender long box or other accounts to cover negative settled
             positions. The system locks assets to nominated accounts in S726 as requested by the
             borrowers, so that these locked assets will not be considered for optimisation. In S728,
             the system calculates the minimum fresh collateral amount that each participant has
             available to introduce for the specific cycle. This calculation can be carried out multiple
             times as required, but will be limited by a specified number of maximum allowed cycles.
             For a tri party repo transaction in which an independent agent bank or clearing house
             oversees a standard two party repo transaction, the calculation will only be carried out
             once, and will indicate that the borrower is responsible for providing 100% of the fresh
             collateral.
[0074]                     The borrower may specify the order in which different sources of assets are to be
             considered during the allocation process in S730. The different pools that can be
             considered would be: (1) Available; (2) Unavailable; (3) Reserved for market trades; (4)
             Reserved for Internal trades; (5) External Long Boxes; and (6) Projections and
             Simulations Assets; and (7) Credit.
[0075]                     Available pools with reference to item (1) above are those that are ready for use
             by the allocation algorithm. Unavailable pools with reference to item (2) above includes
             long box collateral that cannot be use for allocation, e.g. a market delivery pending
             settlement. Reserved for market trades with reference to item (3) above refers to trades
             received from borrower but not yet instructed to market. With reference to item (4), the
             pools reserved for internal transfers include inter-account movements instructed by
                                                           25
10138715 1 (GHMatters) P87900.AU.2

             borrower. With reference to item (5), external long box pools may include assets from
             external long boxes other than the borrower global long box integrated with the system.
             With reference to item (6), projection and simulation assets or cash includes those assets
             used for projections and simulations as well as cash.               With reference to item (7)
             embodiments of the invention may also be used as an asset pool during allocation.
[0076]                     In S732, the order of selection will drive the process of allocating fresh assets.
             The system will order the assets within each pool based on the borrower's specified
             BQRs.            Fresh assets will then be allocated, based on the sequence of pools described
             above. This activity is described below in further detail. As will be further described,
             two fundamental approaches involve first selecting a lender, and allocating to all of its
             deals by cycling through available assets in the available pools, and alternately, by first
             selecting an asset and allocating it to various deals of different lenders before moving on
             to the next asset.
[0077]                     In S736,     the system will check to see whether the selected run is a
             rehypothecation run.            If it is not a rehypothecation run, the system will check for
             coverage in S740. Additional allocation will be performed in S746 if everything is not
             covered.
[0078]                     If the run is a rehypothecation run in S736, the system address received assets by
             assigning the introducer's BQRs to the notional long boxes. A borrower could have
             numerous notional long boxes, each carrying assets received exclusively from one other
             individual rehypothecation participant. In S738, the system allocates the received assets.
             In S740, the system checks to see if everything is covered. If all items are not covered in
             S740, a check for completion of maximum cycles is to be carried out in S742.                   If
                                                             26
10138715 1 (GHMatters) P87900.AU.2

             everything is covered in S740, the next step will be to record a post-allocation snapshot in
              S750.
[0079]                     In evaluating the completion of maximum cycles in S742, the system determines
             if it will be possible to carry out another cycle. If the maximum cycles have not been
             completed in S742, then it is possible to run another cycle in S728.          If the maximum
             cycles have been completed, then the next step will be to attempt final allocation in S746.
[0080]                     The final allocation attempt of S746 will aim to complete the collateralisation
             using fresh assets only, effectively abandoning any further attempts at rehypothecation.
             However, if collateralisation is not achievable using fresh assets only, credit can be
             obtained as the final alternative.
[0081]                     Following the allocation of S738 or S746, the next step is to record a post
             allocation snapshot in S750. Netting follows in S752 where the differences between the
             pre and post allocation snapshots are to be evaluated, thus identifying the potential
             movements of assets.
[0082]                     Before either the instruction of any movement of assets, or the setting of
             movements to null, a number of checks are to be performed. First there will be a check to
             see if it is a simulation run in S754. If it is a simulation run in S754, then account
             movements are to be set to null in S758, effectively abandoning any changes to the
             account. If it is not a simulation run in S754, the next check will be to see if the account
             will be left worse-off in S756.
[0083]                     If the account will be left worse off in S756, then the movements are to be set to
             null in S758. If the account is not worse off, the next check will be to see if the run is a
             rehypothecation run in S760. If the run is a rehypothecation run in S760, the next step
                                                            27
10138715 1 (GHMatters) P87900.AU.2

             will be to instruct the settlement of movements to the target platforms. If the run is not a
             rehypothecation run in S760, the next check is whether approvals have been received in
              S762 in the case that third party approvals are required.
[0084]                     If third party approvals are required and the request for third party approval either
             times out or is rejected, movements are set to null. If the request for third party approval
             is approved, the next step instructs the settlement of movements to the target platforms in
              S764.
[0085]                      Subsequently, the system unlocks the previously locked credit lines in S766 and
             collateral accounts in S770.            Ultimately, the system prepares reports based on the
             allocation in S780. The reports will be able to present information captured within the
             allocation process. The process finishes in S790.
[0086]                     Within this allocation process, a number of steps may be taken in the case of
             default. The pre-allocation snapshot records the default and the defaulting participant is
             not included in the 'calculate fresh' activity. The system locks the assets, records and
             freezes the value of collateral, and maintains the value independent of changes in market
             value.
[0087]              FIG. 8 is flow chart illustrating a process of allocation by asset in accordance with an
             embodiment of the invention. The process begins in S800 and the pool of assets is
             selected in S802. As described earlier, the ordering of the pools is driven by the

             external long boxes, assets reserved for market trades, assets reserved for internal
             transfers, projection and simulation positions, cash, credit, or other sources.            Having
             selected the pool, the system identifies the next asset within this pool in S804.

[0088]              In S806, the system identifies the next lender. The ordering of the lenders may be
             influenced by several factors. One factor is the selections that the borrower has made to
             highlight some lenders to be allocated at a priority. The system additionally considers the
             goal of the allocation run, e.g. whether best coverage, best value, etc. Having selected
             the lender in S806, the system identifies the next deal for this lender in S808. In S810, the
             system tests the selected asset against the borrower's ineligibility schedule that identifies
             assets which the borrower has designated ineligible. If the asset matches criteria
             specified, it is considered ineligible in S844.
[0089]              If the asset is considered ineligible in S844, the system determines if there are further
             deals available with this lender. If further deals are available in S844, the next deal is
             selected in S808 and the process repeats. If there are no more deals available with this
             lender in S844, the system determines if there are further lenders available in S846. If
             lenders are available in S846, the system selects the next lender in S806 and repeats the
             above-described process. If no more lenders are available in S846, the process ends in
             S650, as the system has tested all available deals with all available lenders.
[0090]              If the asset is considered eligible in S812, the system tests the asset against corporate
             action dates and board lot sizes in S814.          If the test fails in S816, the system again
             searches for more deals or more lenders. If the test of S814, succeeds, the system tests
             against product level eligibility rules in S818.        If the asset fails to meet these product
             level eligibility criteria, it is considered ineligible in S820. If the asset is considered
             ineligible in S820, the next step will be to check if there are further deals available with
             this lender in S844. If additional deals are available in S844, the process described above
             repeats. If there are no more deals available with this lender, the next step will be to
                                                           29
10138715 1 (GHMatters) P87900.AU.2

             check if there are further lenders available in S846. If further lenders are available, the
             system selects a lender in S806 and the process described above repeats. If no further
             lenders are available, the process ends in S850.
[0091]              If the asset is considered eligible in S820, the system conducts eligibility testing
             against lender selected eligibility criteria in S822. If the asset fails to meet the lender
             specified eligibility criteria in S824, it is considered ineligible.
[0092]              If the asset is considered ineligible in S824, the next step will be to check if there are
             further deals available with this lender in S844. If additional deals are available in S844,
             the process described above repeats. If there are no more deals available with this lender,
             the next step will be to check if there are further lenders available in S846. If further
             lenders are available, the system selects a lender in S806 and the process described above
             repeats. If no further lenders are available, the process ends in S850
[0093]              If the asset is considered eligible in S824, the system applies the appropriate discount
             variables in S826. Subsequently, in S828, the system identifies the amount of the asset
             that will be allocated.       This amount may be calculated as the minimum of:            (1) the
             available amount of the asset; (2) the strictest concentration limit applicable to the asset;
             or (3) the RQV shortfall.
[0094]              In S830, the system allocates the asset and updates records. The updated records may
             reflect reduction in the record of the available amount of the asset, reduction in the record
             of the RQV shortfall, and/or an update to the record regarding the amount of
             concentration limit utilised.
[0095]              After the updates, in S840, the system determines whether the asset has been
             depleted. If the asset has not been depleted in S840, the system determines if further
                                                           30
10138715 1 (GHMatters) P87900.AU.2

             deals are available with the lender in S844. If yes, the next deal is to be selected and the
             process repeats. If there are no more deals in S844, the system checks for additional
             lender in S846 and if there are additional lenders available, the process repeats. If not,
             the process ends in S850, having addressed all available deals with all the lenders.
[0096]              If the asset has been depleted in S840, the system checks for further available assets
             for the pool in S836. If further assets are available in S836, the next asset for this pool is
             selected, and the process repeats. If no further assets are available in S836, the system
             checks for additional pools in S832. If additional pools are available in S832, the next
             pool is selected in S802, and the process repeats. If no further pools are available, the
             process ends in S834, having tested all available assets from all the available pools.
[0097]              The approach described with reference to FIG. 8 is best suited to a run where the goal
             is best value, as for each specific asset, the lenders can be ordered according to how they
             value the asset. Therefore, to achieve best value, the asset could be allocated first to the
             lender that values it the highest, and then to other lenders, moving in descending order of
             value given to the asset.
[0098]              FIG. 9 is a flow chart illustrating a process of allocation by lender in accordance with
             an embodiment of the invention. The process begins in S900 and the system selects the
             next lender in S902. The ordering of the lenders will be influenced by any selections that
             the borrower has made to highlight some lenders who are to be allocated at a priority, and
             the goal of the allocation run, e.g. whether best coverage, best value, etc.
[0099]              After selecting the lender in S902, the system identifies the next deal of this lender in
             S906.          In S910, the system selects the next pool to be used for sourcing assets. As
             described above, the ordering of the pools is driven by the borrower's selections.
                                                           31
10138715 1 (GHMatters) P87900.AU.2

[00100]             Having selected the pool, the system identifies the next asset from the pool in S912.
             Within each pool, assets are ordered based on the borrower BQRs. In S916, the system
             tests the selected asset against the borrower ineligibility schedule.           If the asset is
             considered ineligible in S920, the system determines in S952 whether there are further
             assets available in the same pool. If further assets are available, the system selects the
             next asset in S912 and the process repeats. If there are no more assets available in this
             pool, the system determines in S956 whether there are further pools available. If further
             pools are available in S956, the system selects the next pool in S910 and the process
             repeats. Otherwise, the process ends in S962.
[00101]             If the asset is considered eligible in S920, the system tests in S922 whether the asset
             breaks any settings related to corporate actions dates or board lot sizes.          If the asset
             breaks either of these settings it is to be considered ineligible in S924. If the asset is
             ineligible, the process of locating additional assets and/or pools as set forth above is
             repeated.
[00102]             If the asset is considered eligible in S924, the system tests against product level
             eligibility rules in S926. If the asset fails to meet these product level eligibility criteria in
              S930, it is considered ineligible.        If the asset is ineligible, the process of locating
             additional assets and/or pools as set forth above is repeated.
[00103]             If the asset is considered eligible in S930, the next step will be to conduct eligibility
             testing against lender selected eligibility criteria in S932. If the asset fails to meet the
             lender specified eligibility criteria in S934, it is considered ineligible. If the asset is
             ineligible the process of locating additional assets and/or pools as set forth above is
                                                           32
10138715 1 (GHMatters) P87900.AU.2

             repeated. If the asset is considered eligible in S934, appropriate discount variables may
             be applied in S936.
[00104]             In S942, the system identifies the amount of the asset that will be allocated.      In
             embodiments of the invention, this amount may be calculated as the minimum of: (1) the
             available amount of the asset, (2) the strictest concentration limit applicable to the asset,
             and (3) the RQV shortfall. In S946, based on the logic above, the appropriate amount of
             the asset is allocated.    After the allocation, the system updates the records to reflect
             reduction in the record of the available amount of the asset, reduction in the record of the
             RQV shortfall, and the amount of concentration limit utilised.
[00105]             Following the updates, the system determines if the deal has been allocated. If the
             deal has not been allocated in S950. If the deal has not been allocated, the system checks
             to see if further assets and pools are available as set forth above and if further assets
             and/or pools are available, the process repeats.
[00106]             If the deal has been allocated in S950, a check is made to see if further deals are
             available for this lender in S964. If further deals are available in S964, the next deal for
             this lender is selected in S906, and the process repeats. If no further deals are available
             for this lender in S964, the system checks for further lenders in S966. If further lenders
             are available in S966, the next lender is selected, and the process repeats. If no further
             lenders are available, the process ends in S960, having addressed all available deals from
             all the available lenders.
[00107]             The approach of Fig. 9 is be best suited to a run where the goal is best coverage,
             because if a particular lender is not being successfully allocated, the process can be rolled
             back, the sequence of lenders modified, and a fresh attempt made at allocation. The
                                                       33

             successful sequence could then be utilised as the starting sequence for the following
             allocation run, increasing the probability of achieving a successful run while carrying out
             fewer iterations.

[00112]                    Computers typically include a variety of computer readable media that can form
             part of the system memory and be read by the processing unit. By way of example, and
             not limitation, computer readable media may comprise computer storage media and
             communication media. The system memory 1250 may include computer storage media
             in the form of volatile and/or nonvolatile memory such as read only memory (ROM)
              1260 and random access memory (RAM) 1270.

[00114]                    At a minimum, the memory 1250 includes at least one set of instructions that is
             either permanently or temporarily stored. The processor 1216 executes the instructions
             that are stored in order to process data.        The set of instructions may include various
             instructions that perform a particular task or tasks, such as those shown in the appended
             flowcharts.           Such a set of instructions for performing a particular task may be
             characterized as a program, software program, software, engine, module, component,
             mechanism, or tool.          The application programs related to collateral management may
             include a plurality of software processing modules stored in a memory as described
             above and executed on a processor in the manner described herein.              The program
             modules may be in the form of any suitable programming language, which is converted
             to machine language or object code to allow the processor or processors to read the

             instructions. That is, written lines of programming code or source code, in a particular
             programming language, may be converted to machine language using a compiler,
             assembler, or interpreter.           The machine language may be binary coded machine
             instructions specific to a particular computer.
[00115]                    Any suitable programming language may be used in accordance with the various
             embodiments of the invention.             Illustratively, the programming language used may
             include assembly language, Ada, APL, Basic, C, C++,                      COBOL, dBase, Forth,
             FORTRAN, Java, Modula-2, Pascal, Prolog, REXX, and/or JavaScript for example.
             Further, it is not necessary that a single type of instruction or programming language be
             utilized in conjunction with the operation of the system and method of the invention.
             Rather, any number of different programming languages may be utilized as is necessary
             or desirable.
[00116]                    Also, the instructions and/or data used in the practice of the invention may utilize
             any compression or encryption technique or algorithm, as may be desired. An encryption
             module might be used to encrypt data.              Further, files or other data may be decrypted
             using a suitable decryption module.
[00117]                    The computing environment may also include other removable/nonremovable,
             volatile/nonvolatile computer storage media. For example, a hard disk drive may read or
             write to nonremovable, nonvolatile magnetic media. A magnetic disk drive may read
             from or writes to a removable, nonvolatile magnetic disk, and an optical disk drive may

[00126]                    Thus, embodiments of the present invention are directed a system and method for
             offering global collateral management financing and liquidity services and in particular to
             implementing an improved eligibility and allocation platform for global collateral
             management. The proposed system will implement a single comprehensive platform for
             managing collateral positions, eligibility, and allocation across multiple obligation types
             and multiple regions.
[00127]                    Participants will have a global view of their positions and obligations in the global
             long box. The global long box will have the capability to include internally held real and
             hypothetical positions as well as those that have been rehypothecated.               Furthermore,
             externally held positions that are in the participant's own account, for example in
             Euroclear or DTCC, will be included.              The long box serves as a custody or holding
             account into which assets are delivered for eventual allocation, whether this be for real or
             hypothetical.
                                                            40
10138715 1 (GHMatters) P87900.AU.2

[00128]                    The eligibility and allocation system allocates collateral from the global long box
             in a borrower selected manner across all the global obligations, whilst considering
             eligibility criteria set by both lenders and borrowers on those obligations. The eligibility
             and allocation engine accesses a data repository that functions as a centralized source of
             eligibility and position data for all collateral management products. The system has the
             capability for both actual and hypothetical allocation. The allocation system uses a set of
             algorithms and rules to ensure positions are collateralized according to configurable set of
             allocation rules and eligibility criteria.
[00129]                       Although the platform will be available globally, it may be distributed locally
             within an organization and to organizational participants.             Furthermore, the platform
             enables global management of all different types of collateral.              In order to operate
             globally, the platform must support many types of currencies and operate across time
             zones.
[00130]                    In terms of performance, the proposed system will have superior high-speed
             application performance, flexibility and scalability, and will perform many functions in
             real-time. In summary, the proposed global platform includes global capabilities, and
             simplifies participant use by providing an improved user interface, advanced reporting
             capabilities, minimal manual processes with as much automated workflow for participant
             on-boarding, deal processing, margin management, alongside central and secure storage
             for eligibility requirements and a single eligibility and allocation algorithm. There will be
             interfaces between the system and other internal and third-party utilities.

                           maintaining a global long box available to each borrower, each global long box
             configured for storing all available types of assets possessed by each borrower;
                           storing eligibility and concentration limits in an eligibility database, the
             concentration limits defined by lender rules controlling the acceptability of the available
             assets for use as collateral, the value of the assets, and overall acceptable composition of
             assets, the eligibility and concentration limits including parameters established for the
             requirement of acceptable collateral by lenders including eligible types of collateral and
             an amount of collateral expressed as one of an amount and a percentage.
