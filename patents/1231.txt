                                    FIELD OF THE INVENTION
           The present invention relates generally to beverages           containing  rare   sugars.
   Specifically, the present invention relates to beverages containing rare sugars and sweetness
   enhancers, wherein the sweetness enhancer is present in a concentration at or below its
15 sweetness recognition threshold. The present invention also relates to beverages containing
   rare sugars and natural high potency sweeteners in particular weight ratios. The beverages of
   the present invention have improved flavor and temporal profiles.
                               BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
20         Natural caloric sugars, such as sucrose, fructose and glucose, are utilized to provide a
   pleasant taste to beverages. Sucrose, in particular, imparts a taste preferred by consumers.
   Although sucrose provides superior sweetness characteristics, it is caloric. Non-caloric or low
   caloric sweeteners have been introduced to satisfy consumer demand. However, sweeteners
   within this class differ from natural caloric sugars in ways that continue to frustrate
25 consumers. On a taste basis, non-caloric or low caloric sweeteners exhibit a temporal profile,
   maximal response, flavor profile, mouth feel, and/or adaptation behavior that differ from
   sugar. Specifically, non-caloric or low caloric sweeteners exhibit delayed sweetness onset,
   lingering sweet aftertaste, bitter taste, metallic taste, astringent taste, cooling taste and/or
   licorice-like taste. On a source basis, many non-caloric or low caloric sweeteners are synthetic
30 chemicals.
           Accordingly, the desire for beverages containing natural non-caloric or low caloric
   sweeteners that taste like beverages containing sucrose remains high.
                                                 -1-

           D-psicose (allulose) is a rare sugar found in small quantities in molasses and
   isomerized sugars. It can also be prepared enzymatically from D-fructose with epimerase. D
   psicose contains almost no calorie content and yields less than about 0.2% metabolic energy of
   the equivalent amount of sucrose. D-psicose is self-GRAS with a letter of no objection from
 5 the US FDA. It is currently approved at a maximum level of 2.1% (w/w) in a non-alcoholic
   beverage. However, 2% (w/w) D-psicose has a sucrose equivalence of only about 1.26% when
   prepared in a citric acid/potassium citrate matrix, thereby limiting its use in beverages.
           Accordingly, there remains a need to develop beverages containing rare sugars,
   particularly D-psicose, with increased sucrose equivalence.
10         The discussion of documents, acts, materials, devices, articles and the like is included
   in this specification solely for the purpose of providing a context for the present invention. It
   is not suggested or represented that any or all of these matters formed part of the prior art base
   or were common general knowledge in the field relevant to the present invention as it existed
   before the priority date of each claim of this application.
15         Where the terms "comprise", "comprises", "comprised" or "comprising" are used in
   this specification (including the claims) they are to be interpreted as specifying the presence of
   the stated features, integers, steps or components, but not precluding the presence of one or
   more other features, integers, steps or components, or group thereof.

20                          DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
           The present invention is directed to beverages containing rare sugars, particularly where
   rare sugars are the primary sweeteners in a beverage, as well as methods of making the same or
   methods of sweetening a beverage comprising a rare sugar.
   Sweetness Enhancement of Rare sugars
25         In one embodiment, the present invention provides a beverage comprising a rare sugar
   and a sweetness enhancer, wherein the sweetness enhancer is present in a concentration at or
   below its sweetness recognition threshold.
           The present invention is based on the discovery that certain compounds (referred to
   herein as "sweetness enhancers") will enhance the detected sweetness (i.e., sucrose equivalence)
30 of a beverage containing one or more rare sugars, wherein the sweetness enhancer is present in a
   concentration at or below the sweetness recognition threshold.
                                                   -5-

   WO 2014/152791                                                                PCT/US2014/027747
           As used herein, the term "sweetness enhancer" refers to a compound capable of
   enhancing or intensifying the perception of sweet taste in a composition, such as a beverage. The
   term "sweetness enhancer" is synonymous with the terms "sweet taste potentiator," "sweetness
   potentiator," "sweetness amplifier," and "sweetness intensifier."
 5         The term "sweetness recognition threshold concentration," as generally used herein, is
   the lowest known concentration of a sweet compound that is perceivable by the human sense of
   taste, typically around 1.0% sucrose equivalence (1.0% SE). While the particular sweetness
   recognition threshold concentration between sweetness enhancers can vary, generally the
   concentration of sweetness enhancer is below 500 ppm, such as, for example, from about 5 ppm
10 to about 300 ppm, from about 50 ppm to about 200 ppm or from about 100 ppm to about 200
   ppm.
           Generally, the sweetness enhancers may enhance or potentiate the sweet taste of
   sweeteners without providing any noticeable sweet taste by themselves when present at or below
   the sweetness recognition threshold concentration of a given sweetness enhancer; however, the
15 sweetness enhancers may themselves provide sweet taste at concentrations above their sweetness
   recognition threshold concentration. The sweetness recognition threshold concentration is
   specific for a particular enhancer and can vary based on the beverage matrix. The sweetness
   recognition threshold concentration can be easily determined by taste testing increasing
   concentrations of a given enhancer until greater than 1.0% sucrose equivalence in a given
20 beverage matrix is detected. The concentration that provides about 1.0% sucrose equivalence is
   considered the sweetness recognition threshold.
           In a particular embodiment, addition of the sweetness enhancer at a concentration at or
   below its sweetness recognition threshold to a beverage containing one or more rare sugars
   increases the detected sucrose equivalence of said beverage by an amount more than the
25 detectable sweetness of a solution containing the same concentration of the sweetness enhancer
   in the absence of any sweeteners.
           Addition of a sweetness enhancer of the present invention at a concentration at or below
   its sweetness recognition threshold to a beverage containing one or more rare sugars may
   increase the detected sucrose equivalence by about 0.5% or greater, e.g., the sucrose equivalence
30 is increased by greater than about 0.5%, about 0.6%, about 0.7%, about 0.8%, about 0.9%, about
                                                  -6-

   WO 2014/152791                                                                PCT/US2014/027747
    1.0%, about 1.1%, about 1.2%, about 1.3%, about 1.4%, about 1.5%, about 1.6%, about 1.7%,
   about 1.8%, about 1.9%, about 2%, about 3%, about 4% or about 5%.
           In some embodiments, the sucrose equivalence of the beverage can be from about 1.5%
   to about 12%, such as, for example, about 1.5% to about 10%, about 1.5% to about 5%, about
 5  1.5% to about 3.5% or about 1.5% to about 2.0%.
           For example, Rebaudioside C acts as a sweetness enhancer when present below at or
   below its sweetness recognition threshold concentration in beverages containing from about
   0.5% to about 2% D-psicose by weight. Accordingly, the detected sucrose equivalence of
   beverages containing D-psicose can be increased above 1.2% when Rebaudioside C is added at a
10 concentration at or below its sweetness recognition threshold. For example, the sucrose
   equivalence can be from about 1.5% to about 3%, such as, for example, about 1.5% to about
   2.0%.
           The rare sugar may vary. Suitable rare sugars include, but are not limited to, D-allose, D
   psicose, L-ribose, D-tagatose, L-glucose, L-fucose, L-arabinose, D-turanose, D-leucrose and
15 combinations thereof.
           In some embodiments, the rare sugar is present in the beverage in an amount from about
   0.5% to about 12% by weight, such as, for example, about 1.0% by weight, about 1.5% by
   weight, about 2.0% by weight, about 2.5% by weight, about 3.0% by weight, about 3.5% by
   weight, about 4.0% by weight, about 4.5% by weight, about 5.0% by weight, about 5.5% by
20 weight, about 6.0% by weight, about 6.5% by weight, about 7.0% by weight, about 7.5% by
   weight, about 8.0% by weight, about 8.5% by weight, about 9.0% by weight, about 9.5% by
   weight, about 10.0% by weight, about 10.5% by weight, about 11.0% by weight, about 11.5% by
   weight or about 12.0% by weight.
           In a particular embodiment, the rare sugar is present in the beverage in an amount from
25 about 0.5% of about 10%, such as for example, from about 2% to about 8%, from about 3% to
   about 7% or from about 4% to about 6%by weight. In a particular embodiment, the rare sugar is
   present in the beverage in an amount from about 0.5% to about 8% by weight. In another
   particular embodiment, the rare sugar is present in the beverage in an amount from about 2% to
   about 8% by weight. In still another embodiment, the rare sugar is present in the beverage in an
30 amount from about 0.5 to about 3.5%.

   one sweetness enhancer. Moreover, sweetness can be increased by an amount more than the
 5 detectable sweetness of a solution containing the same concentration of the at least one
   sweetness enhancer in the absence of any sweeteners.
           In one embodiment, addition of FEMA GRAS FLAVOR 4701 at a concentration at or
   below its sweetness recognition threshold increases the detected sucrose equivalence of a
   beverage containing D-tagatose by an amount more than the detectable sweetness of a solution
10 containing the same concentration of FEMA GRAS FLAVOR 4701 in the absence of any
   sweeteners. For example, addition of FEMA GRAS FLAVOR 4701 at a concentration at or
   below its sweetness recognition threshold to a beverage containing D-tagatose may increase the
   detected sucrose equivalence by about 0.5% or more, i.e., the sucrose equivalence may be

            The sweetness of a given composition is typically measured with reference to a solution
   of sucrose.    See generally "A Systematic Study of Concentration-Response Relationships of
   Sweeteners," G.E. DuBois, D.E. Walters, S.S. Schiffman, Z.S. Warwick, B.J. Booth,            S.D.

   Society, Washington, DC (1991), pp 261-276.
            The sweetness of a non-sucrose sweetener can be measured against a sucrose reference
   by determining the non-sucrose sweetener's sucrose equivalence. Typically, taste panelists are
20 trained to detect sweetness of reference sucrose solutions containing between 1-15% sucrose
   (w/v). Other non-sucrose sweeteners are then tasted at a series of dilutions to determine the
   concentration of the non-sucrose sweetener that is as sweet as a given percent sucrose reference.
   For example, if a 1% solution of a sweetener is as sweet as a 10% sucrose solution, then the
   sweetener is said to be 10 times as potent as sucrose, and has 10% sucrose equivalence.

   Beverages Containing Rare Sugars and Natural High Potency Sweeteners
            The present invention is also based on the discovery that beverages containing natural
   high potency sweeteners and rare sugars, wherein the two components are present in particular
   weight ratios, have improved flavor and temporal profiles, and taste more like sugar-sweetened
30 beverages compared to corresponding beverages containing the same natural high potency in the
   absence of the rare sugar.
                                                   -31-

   WO 2014/152791                                                                     PCT/US2014/027747
            For example, beverages containing greater than 95% pure Rebaudioside A and 2% D
   psicose by weight, wherein the natural high potency sweetener and D-psicose are in particular
   weight ratios, have improved flavor and temporal profiles and are more sugar-like compared to
   corresponding beverages containing greater than 95% pure Rebaudioside A in the absence of D
 5 psicose.
            As used herein, the "sugar-sweetened" characteristics include any characteristic similar to
   that of beverages containing sucrose and include, but are not limited to, maximal response, flavor
   profile, temporal profile, adaptation behavior, mouthfeel, concentration/response              function,
   tastant/and flavor/sweet taste interactions, spatial pattern selectivity, and temperature effects.
10          The flavor profile of a beverage is a quantitative profile of the relative intensities of all of
   the taste attributes exhibited. Such profiles often are plotted as histograms or radar plots.
            These characteristics are dimensions in which the taste of a beverage containing sucrose
   is different from the tastes of a beverage containing a non-sucrose sweetener(s).             Of these,
   however, the flavor profile and temporal profile are particularly important. In a single tasting of
15 a sweet beverage, differences (1) in the attributes that constitute a beverage's flavor profile and
   (2) in the rates of sweetness onset and dissipation, which constitute a beverage's temporal
   profile, between those observed for sucrose and for non-sucrose sweetener compositions can be
   noted.
            Whether or not a beverage has sugar-sweetened characteristics is determined by an expert
20 sensory panel who taste beverages comprising sugar and beverages compositions comprising
   non-sucrose     sweetener compositions, both with and without additives, and provide their
   impression as to the similarities of the characteristics of the beverages, both with and without
   additives, with those comprising sugar. A suitable procedure for determining whether a beverage
   has a more sugar-like taste is described in embodiments described herein below.
25          In a particular embodiment, a panel of assessors is used to measure the reduction of
   sweetness linger. Briefly described, a panel of assessors (generally 8 to 12 individuals) is trained
   to evaluate sweetness perception and measure sweetness at several time points from when the
   sample is initially taken into the mouth until 3 minutes after it has been expectorated.          Using
   statistical analysis, the results are compared between samples containing additives and samples
30 that do not contain additives. A decrease in score for a time point measured after the sample has
   cleared the mouth indicates there has been a reduction in sweetness perception.
                                                    -32-

   WO 2014/152791                                                                 PCT/US2014/027747
           The panel of assessors may be trained using procedures well known to those of ordinary
   skill in the art. In a particular embodiment, the panel of assessors may be trained using the
   SpectrumTM Descriptive Analysis Method (Meilgaard et al, Sensory Evaluation Techniques,        3rd
   edition, Chapter 11).     Desirably, the focus of training should be the recognition of and the
 5 measure of the basic tastes; specifically, sweet. In order to ensure accuracy and reproducibility
   of results, each assessor should repeat the measure of the reduction of sweetness linger about
   three to about five times per sample, taking at least a five minute break between each repetition
   and/or sample and rinsing well with water to clear the mouth.
           Generally, the method of measuring sweetness comprises taking a 10 mL sample into the
10 mouth, holding the sample in the mouth for 5 seconds and gently swirling the sample in the
   mouth, rating the sweetness intensity perceived at 5 seconds, expectorating the sample (without
   swallowing following expectorating the sample), rinsing with one mouthful of water (e.g.,
   vigorously moving water in mouth as if with mouth wash) and expectorating the rinse water,
   rating the sweetness intensity perceived immediately upon expectorating the rinse water, waiting
15 45 seconds and, while waiting those 45 seconds, identifying the time of maximum perceived
   sweetness intensity and rating the sweetness intensity at that time (moving the mouth normally
   and swallowing as needed), rating the sweetness intensity after another 10 seconds, rating the
   sweetness intensity after another 60 seconds (cumulative 120 seconds after rinse), and rating the
   sweetness intensity after still another 60 seconds (cumulative 180 seconds after rinse). Between
20 samples take a 5 minute break, rinsing well with water to clear the mouth.

   promote health and wellness.
            Saponins are glycosidic natural plant products comprising an aglycone ring structure and
10 one or more sugar moieties. The combination of the nonpolar aglycone and the water soluble
   sugar moiety gives saponins surfactant properties, which allow them to form a foam when
   shaken in an aqueous solution.
            The saponins are grouped together based on several common properties.        In particular,
   saponins are surfactants which display hemolytic activity and form complexes with cholesterol.
15 Although saponins share these properties, they are structurally diverse. The types of aglycone
   ring structures forming the ring structure in saponins can vary greatly. Non-limiting examples of
   the types of aglycone ring structures in saponin for use in particular embodiments of the
   invention include steroids, triterpenoids, and steroidal alkaloids.      Non-limiting examples of
   specific aglycone ring structures for use in particular embodiments of the invention include
20 soyasapogenol A, soyasapogenol B and soyasopogenol E.             The number and type of sugar
   moieties attached to the aglycone ring structure can also vary greatly. Non-limiting examples of
   sugar moieties for use in particular embodiments of the invention include glucose, galactose,
   glucuronic acid, xylose, rhamnose, and methylpentose moieties.           Non-limiting examples of
   specific saponins for use in particular embodiments of the invention include group A acetyl
25 saponin, group B acetyl saponin, and group E acetyl saponin.
            Saponins can be found in a large variety of plants and plant products, and are especially
   prevalent in plant skins and barks where they form a waxy protective coating. Several common
   sources of saponins include soybeans, which have approximately 5% saponin content by dry
   weight, soapwort plants (Saponaria),the root of which was used historically as soap, as well as
30 alfalfa, aloe, asparagus, grapes, chickpeas, yucca, and various other beans and weeds. Saponins
   may be obtained from these sources by using extraction techniques well known to those of
                                                    -47-

            Particular antioxidants belong to the class of phytonutrients called polyphenols (also
   known as "polyphenolics"),        which are a group of chemical substances found in plants,
    characterized by the presence of more than one phenol group per molecule. A variety of health
20 benefits may be derived from polyphenols, including prevention of cancer, heart disease, and

            DietaryFiber
            In certain embodiments, the functional ingredient is at least one dietary fiber source.
            As used herein, the at least one dietary fiber source may comprise a single dietary fiber
    source or a plurality of dietary fiber sources as a functional ingredient for the beverages provided
10 herein. Generally, according to particular embodiments of this invention, the at least one dietary
    fiber source is present in the beverage in a concentration sufficient to promote health and
   wellness.
            Numerous polymeric carbohydrates having significantly different structures in both
    composition and linkages fall within the definition of dietary fiber. Such compounds are well
15 known to those skilled in the art, non-limiting examples of which include non-starch
   polysaccharides, lignin, cellulose, methylcellulose, the hemicelluloses, p-glucans, pectins, gums,
   mucilage, waxes, inulins, oligosaccharides, fructooligosaccharides, cyclodextrins, chitins, and
    combinations thereof.
            Polysaccharides are complex carbohydrates composed of monosaccharides joined by
20  glycosidic linkages. Non-starch polysaccharides are bonded with         p-linkages, which humans are
   unable to digest due to a lack of an enzyme to break the          p-linkages.   Conversely, digestable
    starch polysaccharides generally comprise a(l-4) linkages.
            Lignin is a large, highly branched and cross-linked polymer based on oxygenated
   phenylpropane units. Cellulose is a linear polymer of glucose molecules joined by a J(1-4)
25  linkage, which mammalian amylases are unable to hydrolyze. Methylcellulose is a methyl esther
   of cellulose that is often used in foodstuffs as a thickener, and emulsifier. It is commercially
    available   (e.g.,  Citrucel    by   GlaxoSmithKline,      Celevac     by    Shire   Pharmaceuticals).
   Hemicelluloses are highly branched polymers consisting mainly of glucurono- and 4-0
   methylglucuroxylans.      p-Glucans    are mixed-linkage (1-3), (1-4)    p-D-glucose    polymers found
30 primarily in cereals, such as oats and barley.         Pectins, such as beta pectin, are a group of
                                                     -51-

   WO 2014/152791                                                                    PCT/US2014/027747
   polysaccharides composed primarily of D-galacturonic acid, which is methoxylated to variable
   degrees.
           Gums and mucilages represent a broad array of different branched structures. Guar gum,
   derived from the ground endosperm of the guar seed, is a galactomannan.                  Guar gum is
 5 commercially available (e.g., Benefiber by Novartis AG).         Other gums, such as gum arabic and
   pectins, have still different structures. Still other gums include xanthan gum, gellan gum, tara
   gum, psylium seed husk gum, and locust been gum.
           Waxes are esters of ethylene glycol and two fatty acids, generally occurring as a
   hydrophobic liquid that is insoluble in water.
10         Inulins   comprise naturally      occurring    oligosaccharides  belonging to     a class  of
   carbohydrates known as fructans. They generally are comprised of fructose units joined by 0(2
    1) glycosidic linkages with a terminal glucose unit. Oligosaccharides are saccharide polymers
   containing typically three to six component sugars. They are generally found either 0- or N
   linked    to  compatible    amino     acid  side   chains    in proteins   or  to   lipid  molecules.
15 Fructooligosaccharides are oligosaccharides consisting of short chains of fructose molecules.
           Food sources of dietary fiber include, but are not limited to, grains, legumes, fruits, and
   vegetables.    Grains providing dietary fiber include, but are not limited to, oats, rye, barley,
   wheat,.    Legumes providing fiber include, but are not limited to, peas and beans such as
   soybeans.    Fruits and vegetables providing a source of fiber include, but are not limited to,
20 apples, oranges, pears, bananas, berries, tomatoes, green beans, broccoli, cauliflower, carrots,
   potatoes, celery. Plant foods such as bran, nuts, and seeds (such as flax seeds) are also sources of
   dietary fiber. Parts of plants providing dietary fiber include, but are not limited to, the stems,
   roots, leaves, seeds, pulp, and skin.
           Although dietary fiber generally is derived from plant sources, indigestible animal
25 products such as chitins are also classified as dietary fiber. Chitin is a polysaccharide composed
   of units of acetylglucosamine joined by (1-4) linkages, similar to the linkages of cellulose.
            Sources of dietary fiber often are divided into categories of soluble and insoluble fiber
   based on their solubility in water. Both soluble and insoluble fibers are found in plant foods to
   varying degrees depending upon the characteristics of the plant. Although insoluble in water,
30 insoluble fiber has passive hydrophilic properties that help increase bulk, soften stools, and
   shorten transit time of fecal solids through the intestinal tract.

   WO 2014/152791                                                                   PCT/US2014/027747
            Unlike insoluble fiber, soluble fiber readily dissolves in water. Soluble fiber undergoes
   active metabolic processing via fermentation in the colon, increasing the colonic microflora and
   thereby increasing the mass of fecal solids. Fermentation of fibers by colonic bacteria also yields
   end-products with significant health benefits.      For example, fermentation of the food masses
 5 produces gases and short-chain fatty acids. Acids produced during fermentation include butyric,
   acetic, propionic, and valeric acids that have various beneficial properties such as stabilizing
   blood glucose levels by acting on pancreatic insulin release and providing liver control by
   glycogen breakdown. In addition, fiber fermentation may reduce atherosclerosis by lowering
   cholesterol synthesis by the liver and reducing blood levels of LDL and triglycerides. The acids
10 produced during fermentation lower colonic pH, thereby protecting the colon lining from cancer
   polyp formation. The lower colonic pH also increases mineral absorption, improves the barrier
   properties of the colonic mucosal layer, and inhibits inflammatory and adhesion irritants.
   Fermentation of fibers also may benefit the immune system by stimulating production of T
   helper cells, antibodies, leukocytes, splenocytes, cytokinins and lymphocytes.
15          Fatty Acid
            In certain embodiments, the functional ingredient is at least one fatty acid.
            As used herein, the at least one fatty acid may be single fatty acid or a plurality of fatty
   acids as a functional ingredient for the sweetener beverages provided herein.             Generally,
   according to particular embodiments of this invention, the at least one fatty acid is present in the
20 beverage in a concentration sufficient to promote health and wellness.
            As used herein, "fatty acid" refers to any straight chain monocarboxylic acid and includes
   saturated fatty acids, unsaturated fatty acids, long chain fatty acids, medium chain fatty acids,
   short chain fatty acids, fatty acid precursors (including omega-9 fatty acid precursors), and
   esterified fatty acids.   As used herein, "long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid" refers to any
25 polyunsaturated carboxylic acid or organic acid with a long aliphatic tail. As used herein,
   "omega-3 fatty acid" refers to any polyunsaturated fatty acid having a first double bond as the
   third carbon-carbon bond from the terminal methyl end of its carbon chain.             In particular
   embodiments, the omega-3 fatty acid may comprise a long chain omega-3 fatty acid. As used
   herein, "omega-6 fatty acid" any polyunsaturated fatty acid having a first double bond as the
30 sixth carbon-carbon bond from the terminal methyl end of its carbon chain.

   confer beneficial effects to humans.
           In particular embodiments of the invention, the at least one probiotic is chosen from the
   genus Lactobacilli. Lactobacilli (i.e., bacteria of the genus Lactobacillus, hereinafter"L.") have
15 been used for several hundred years as a food preservative and for promoting human health.
   Non-limiting examples of species of Lactobacilli found in the human intestinal tract include L.
   acidophilus, L. case, L. fermentum, L. saliva roes, L. brevis, L. leichmannii, L. plantarum, L.
   cellobiosus, L. reuteri,L. rhamnosus, L. GG, L. bulgaricus, and L. thermophilus,.
           According to other particular embodiments of this invention, the probiotic is chosen from
20 the genus Bifidobacteria. Bifidobacteria also are known to exert a beneficial influence on
   human health by producing short chain fatty acids (e.g., acetic, propionic, and butyric acids),
   lactic, and formic acids as a result of carbohydrate metabolism.         Non-limiting species of
   Bifidobacteria found in the human gastrointestinal tract include B. angulatum, B. animalis, B.

   Streptococcus salivarusand Streptococcus cremoris.
           Probiotics that may be used in accordance with this invention are well-known to those of
   skill in the art.   Non-limiting examples of foodstuffs comprising probiotics include yogurt,
 5 sauerkraut, kefir, kimchi, fermented vegetables, and other foodstuffs containing a microbial
   element that beneficially affects the host animal by improving the intestinal microbalance.
           Prebiotics, in accordance with the teachings of this invention, are compositions that
   promote the growth of beneficial bacteria in the intestines.          Prebiotic substances can be
   consumed by a relevant probiotic, or otherwise assist in keeping the relevant probiotic alive or
10 stimulate its growth. When consumed in an effective amount, prebiotics also beneficially affect
   the human body's naturally-occurring gastrointestinal microflora and thereby impart health
   benefits apart from just nutrition. Prebiotic foods enter the colon and serve as substrate for the
   endogenous bacteria, thereby indirectly providing the host with energy, metabolic substrates, and
   essential micronutrients. The body's digestion and absorption of prebiotic foods is dependent
15 upon bacterial metabolic activity, which salvages energy for the host from nutrients that escaped
   digestion and absorption in the small intestine.
           Prebiotics, in accordance with the embodiments of this invention, include, without
   limitation, mucopolysaccharides, oligosaccharides, polysaccharides, amino acids, vitamins,
   nutrient precursors, proteins and combinations thereof.
20         According to a particular embodiment of this invention, the prebiotic is chosen from
   dietary fibers, including, without limitation, polysaccharides and oligosaccharides.           These
   compounds have the ability to increase the number of probiotics, which leads to the benefits
   conferred by the probiotics. Non-limiting examples of oligosaccharides that are categorized as
   prebiotics    in  accordance    with    particular    embodiments    of   this   invention   include
25 fructooligosaccharides,   inulins, isomalto-oligosaccharides, lactilol,     lactosucrose, lactulose,
   pyrodextrins, soy oligosaccharides, transgalacto-oligosaccharides, and xylo-oligosaccharides.
           According to other particular embodiments of the invention, the prebiotic is an amino
   acid.   Although a number of known prebiotics break down to provide carbohydrates for
   probiotics, some probiotics also require amino acids for nourishment.
30         Prebiotics are found naturally in a variety of foods including, without limitation, bananas,
   berries, asparagus, garlic, wheat, oats, barley (and other whole grains), flaxseed, tomatoes,

   compositions", "satiety agents", and "satiety ingredients" are synonymous. The phrase "appetite
   suppressant" describes macronutrients, herbal        extracts, exogenous hormones, anorectics,
15 anorexigenics, pharmaceutical drugs, and combinations thereof, that when delivered in an
   effective amount, suppress, inhibit, reduce, or otherwise curtail a person's appetite. The phrase
   "thermogenesis      agent"  describes  macronutrients,   herbal   extracts,   exogenous  hormones,
   anorectics, anorexigenics, pharmaceutical drugs, and combinations thereof, that when delivered
   in an effective amount, activate or otherwise enhance a person's thermogenesis or metabolism.
20          Suitable weight management agents include macronutrient selected from the group
   consisting of proteins, carbohydrates, dietary fats, and combinations thereof. Consumption of
   proteins, carbohydrates, and dietary fats stimulates the release of peptides with appetite
   suppressing effects. For example, consumption of proteins and dietary fats stimulates the release
   of the gut hormone cholecytokinin (CCK), while consumption of carbohydrates and dietary fats
25 stimulates release of Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1).
            Suitable   macronutrient   weight   management     agents   also include    carbohydrates.
   Carbohydrates generally comprise sugars, starches, cellulose and gums that the body converts
   into glucose for energy.      Carbohydrates often are classified into two categories, digestible
   carbohydrates      (e.g.,  monosaccharides,   disaccharides,    and   starch)   and   non-digestible
30 carbohydrates (e.g., dietary fiber).   Studies have shown that non-digestible carbohydrates and
   complex polymeric carbohydrates having reduced absorption and digestibility in the small

    intestine   stimulate physiologic    responses    that  inhibit food intake.     Accordingly, the
    carbohydrates     embodied    herein    desirably    comprise   non-digestible  carbohydrates    or
    carbohydrates with reduced digestibility. Non-limiting examples of such carbohydrates include
    polydextrose; inulin; monosaccharide-derived polyols such as erythritol, mannitol, xylitol, and
 5  sorbitol; disaccharide-derived alcohols such as isomalt, lactitol, and maltitol; and hydrogenated
    starch hydrolysates. Carbohydrates are described in more detail herein below.
            In another particular embodiment weight management agent is a dietary fat. Dietary fats
    are lipids comprising combinations of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids.       Polyunsaturated
    fatty acids have been shown to have a greater satiating power than mono-unsaturated fatty acids.
10  Accordingly, the dietary fats embodied herein desirably comprise poly-unsaturated fatty acids,
    non-limiting examples of which include triacylglycerols.
            In a particular embodiment, the weight management agents is an herbal extract. Extracts
    from numerous types of plants have been identified as possessing appetite suppressant
    properties. Non-limiting examples of plants whose extracts have appetite suppressant properties
15  include plants of the genus Hoodia, Trichocaulon, Caralluma,Stapelia, Or/ea, Asclepias, and
    Camelia. Other embodiments include extracts derived from Gymnema Sylvestre, Kola Nut,

20  Non-limiting examples of plant material and biomass include the stems, roots, leaves, dried
    powder obtained from the plant material, and sap or dried sap. The herbal extracts generally are
    prepared by extracting sap from the plant and then spray-drying the sap. Alternatively, solvent
    extraction procedures may be employed. Following the initial extraction, it may be desirable to
    further fractionate the initial extract (e.g., by column chromatography) in order to obtain an
25  herbal extract with enhanced activity. Such techniques are well known to those of ordinary skill
    in the art.
            In a particular embodiment, the herbal extract is derived from a plant of the genus
    Hoodia, species of which include H. alstonii, H. currorii,H. dregei, H. flava, H. gordonii, H.

   Stapelia or Orbea, species of which include S. gigantean and 0. variegate, respectively. Both
   Stapelia and Orbea plants belong to the same Subfamily as Hoodia, Asclepiadaceae.                Not
   wishing to be bound by any theory, it is believed that the compounds exhibiting appetite
20 suppressant activity are saponins, such as pregnane glycosides, which include stavarosides A, B,
   C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, and K.
            In another particular embodiment, the herbal extract is derived from a plant of the genus
   Asclepias. Asclepias plants also belong to the Asclepiadaceae family of plants. Non-limiting
   examples of Asclepias plants include A. incarnate,A. curassayica,A. syriaca, and A. tuberose.
25 Not wishing to be bound by any theory, it is believed that the extracts comprise steroidal
   compounds, such as pregnane glycosides and pregnane aglycone, having appetite suppressant
   effects.

           Long-Chain PrimaryAliphatic SaturatedAlcohol
            In certain embodiments, the functional ingredient is at least one long chain primary
   aliphatic saturated alcohol. As used herein, the at least one long chain primary aliphatic saturated
20 alcohol may be single long chain primary aliphatic saturated alcohol or a plurality of long chain
   primary aliphatic saturated alcohols as a functional ingredient for the beverages provided herein.
   Generally, according to particular embodiments of this invention, the at least one long chain
   primary aliphatic saturated alcohol is present in the beverage in a concentration sufficient to
   promote health and wellness.
25         Long-chain primary aliphatic saturated alcohols are a diverse group of organic
   compounds. The term alcohol refers to the fact these compounds feature a hydroxyl group (-OH)
   bound to a carbon atom. The term primary refers to the fact that in these compounds the carbon
   atom which is bound to the hydroxyl group is bound to only one other carbon atom. The term
   saturated refers to the fact that these compounds feature no carbon to carbon pi bonds. The term
30 aliphatic refers to the fact that the carbon atoms in these compounds are joined together in
                                                   -68-

   WO 2014/152791                                                                PCT/US2014/027747
   straight or branched chains rather than in rings. The term long-chain refers to the fact that the
   number of carbon atoms in these compounds is at least 8 carbons).
            Non-limiting examples of particular long-chain primary aliphatic saturated alcohols for
   use in particular embodiments of the invention include the 8 carbon atom 1-octanol, the 9 carbon
 5  1-nonanol, the 10 carbon atom 1-decanol, the 12 carbon atom 1-dodecanol, the 14 carbon atom
    1-tetradecanol, the 16 carbon atom 1-hexadecanol, the 18 carbon atom 1-octadecanol, the 20
   carbon atom l-eicosanol, the 22 carbon 1-docosanol, the 24 carbon 1-tetracosanol, the 26 carbon
    1-hexacosanol, the 27 carbon 1-heptacosanol, the 28 carbon 1-octanosol, the 29 carbon 1
   nonacosanol, the 30 carbon 1-triacontanol, the 32 carbon 1-dotriacontanol, and the 34 carbon 1
10 tetracontanol.
            In a particularly desirable embodiment of the invention, the long-chain primary aliphatic
   saturated alcohols are policosanol. Policosanol is the term for a mixture of long-chain primary
   aliphatic saturated alcohols composed primarily of 28 carbon 1-octanosol and 30 carbon 1
   triacontanol, as well as other alcohols in lower concentrations such as 22 carbon 1-docosanol, 24
15 carbon 1-tetracosanol, 26 carbon 1-hexacosanol, 27 carbon 1-heptacosanol, 29 carbon 1
   nonacosanol, 32 carbon 1-dotriacontanol, and 34 carbon 1-tetracontanol.
            Long-chain primary aliphatic saturated alcohols are derived from natural fats and oils.
   They may be obtained from these sources by using extraction techniques well known to those of
   ordinary skill in the art. Policosanols can be isolated from a variety of plants and materials
20 including sugar cane (Saccharum ofjicinarium), yams (e.g. Dioscorea opposite), bran from rice
   (e.g. Oryza sativa), and beeswax. Policosanols may be obtained from these sources by using
   extraction techniques well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. A description of such
   extraction techniques can be found in U.S. Pat. Appl. No. 2005/0220868, the disclosure of which
   is expressly incorporated by reference.

            Phytosterols
            In certain embodiments, the functional ingredient is at least one phytosterol,
   phytostanol or combination thereof. Generally, according to particular embodiments of this
   invention, the at least one phytosterol, phytostanol or combination thereof is present in the
 5 beverage in a concentration sufficient to promote health and wellness.
            As used herein, the phrases "stanol", "plant stanol" and "phytostanol" are synonymous.
            Plant sterols and stanols are present naturally in small quantities in many fruits,
   vegetables, nuts, seeds, cereals, legumes, vegetable oils, bark of the trees and other plant
   sources. Although people normally consume plant sterols and stanols every day, the amounts
10 consumed are insufficient to have significant cholesterol-lowering effects or other health
   benefits. Accordingly, it would be desirable to supplement food and beverages with plant
   sterols and stanols.
            Sterols are a subgroup of steroids with a hydroxyl group at C-3. Generally,
   phytosterols have a double bond within the steroid nucleus, like cholesterol; however,
15 phytosterols also may comprise a substituted sidechain (R) at C-24, such as an ethyl or methyl
   group, or an additional double bond. The structures of phytosterols are well known to those of
   skill in the art.
            At least 44 naturally-occurring phytosterols have been discovered, and generally are
   derived from plants, such as com, soy, wheat, and wood oils; however, they also may be
20 produced synthetically to form compositions identical to those in nature or having properties
   similar to those of naturally-occurring phytosterols. According to particular embodiments of
   this invention, non-limiting examples of phytosterols previously described to those of ordinary
   skill in the art include 4-desmethylsterols (e.g.,        p-sitosterol, campesterol, stigmasterol,
   brassicasterol, 22-dehydrobrassicasterol, and A5-avenasterol), 4-monomethyl sterols, and 4,4
25 dimethyl           sterols        (triterpene         alcohols)          (e.g.,      cycloartenol,
   24-methylenecycloartanol, and cyclobranol).
            As used herein, the phrases "stanol", "plant stanol" and "phytostanol" are synonymous.
   Phytostanols are saturated sterol alcohols present in only trace amounts in nature and also may
   be synthetically produced, such as by hydrogenation of phytosterols. According to particular
30 embodiments of this invention, non-limiting examples of phytostanols include          p-sitostanol,
   campestanol, cycloartanol, and saturated forms of other triterpene alcohols.

            Both phytosterols and phytostanols, as used herein, include the various isomers such as
   the a and   P isomers  (e.g., a-sitosterol and  p-sitostanol, which comprise one of the most effective
   phytosterols and phytostanols, respectively, for lowering serum cholesterol in mammals).
            The phytosterols and phytostanols of the present invention also may be in their ester
 5 form. Suitable methods for deriving the esters of phytosterols and phytostanols are well known
   to those of ordinary skill in the art, and are disclosed in U.S. Patent Numbers 6,589,588,
   6,635,774, 6,800,317, and U.S. Patent Publication Number 2003/0045473, the disclosures of
   which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. Non-limiting examples of suitable
   phytosterol and phytostanol esters include sitosterol acetate, sitosterol oleate, stigmasterol oleate,
10 and their corresponding phytostanol esters.         The phytosterols and phytostanols of the present
   invention also may include their derivatives.
            Generally, the amount of functional ingredient in the beverage varies widely depending
   on the particular beverage and the desired functional ingredient. Those of ordinary skill in the
   art will readily acertain the appropriate amount of functional ingredient for each beverage.

   Taste Evaluation
            Taste tests were carried out with eight panelists. Bottles were removed from the
   refrigerator and about 50 ml of beverage was poured into 4 oz- plastic cups. Panelists were given
 5 mineral water to rinse their mouth before tasting and between tasting different samples. Unsalted
   crackers were also given to panelists to eat. Taste tests were done in two rounds: a first round in
   which a sample of D-psicose in citric acid/potassium citrate buffer and a sample of D-psicose
   and Reb-C in citric acid/potassium citrate buffer were evaluated, and a second round in which a
   sample of D-psicose in a lemon lime carbonated soft drink and a sample of D-psicose and Reb-C
10 in a lemon lime carbonated soft drink were evaluated. In each round, panelists were asked to e
   choose the sweetest sample among the pair, then rate the sweetness level against control
   solutions of 1%, 1.5%, and 2% sucrose in citric acid/potassium citrate buffer.
            All eight panelists identified the sample containing 2% D-psicose and 220 ppm
   Rebaudioside C as the sweeter sample, regardless of which beverage matrix was used.
15          The majority of panelists determined the sample containing 2% D-psicose and 220 ppm
   Rebaudioside C as having the same or greater sweetness than the 2% sucrose in citric
   acid/potassium citrate buffer. 2% D-psicose has a sweetness equivalence of 1.2% sucrose in the
   absence of Rebaudioside C. Rebaudioside C at 220 ppm in citric acid/potassium citrate buffer
   has a sucrose equivalence of less than 1.0%. Accordingly, 220 ppm Rebaudioside C acted to
20 enhance the sweetness of the citric acid/potassium citrate buffer-based beverage containing 2%
   D-psicose.

   plastic bottles and stored at ambient temperature. Some bottles were randomly picked and kept in
   the refrigerator at 4 0 C for taste evaluation.

   EXAMPLE 5: Sweetness Enhancement of Beverages Containing D-Psicose by 2,4
   dihydroxybenzoic acid
            D-Psicose was evaluated at its concentration equivalent to 5% sucrose equivalence (5%
   SE), or the concentration required to have the same sweetness as of a 5 % sucrose solution. 2,4
 5 Dihydroxybenzoic acid was used at 500 ppm, corresponding to its maximum value allowable in
   non-alcoholic beverages.
            First, the sweetness level of 2,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid was evaluated against three
   solutions of 1%, 2%, and 3% sucrose. Second, the sweetness level of a solution containing D
   psicose and 500 ppm 2,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid was evaluated against 5%, 6.5%, and 7%
10 sucrose solutions. All solutions were made in citric acid/potassium citrate buffer.
            Solutions were prepared with the ingredients provided in Tables 13-15. All ingredients
   were dissolved in treated water. Citric acid and potassium citrate were added in a sufficient
   amount to bring the final pH to 3.2. Solutions were filled in 300ml-glass bottles and chilled in

   Taste Evaluation
 5         Beverages were kept in the refrigerator overnight and tasted cold the following day. Two
   panelists evaluated the beverages. Bottles were removed from the refrigerator and about 20 ml of
   beverage poured in 2 oz- plastic cups. Mineral water was given for palate rinsing before tasting
   and between tasting different samples. Unsalted crackers were also given.
           First, the panelists assessed the sweetness of 500 ppm 2,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid in citric
10 acid buffer against 1%, 2% and 3% sucrose solutions in citric acid buffer. The panelists found
   that 500 ppm 2,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid had a sweetness slightly below the sweetness of 1%
   sucrose solution. Next, a D-psicose solution (5% SE) was evaluated for its sweetness against 5%
   and 6.5% sucrose solutions, where it was found to be equally sweet to 5% sucrose solution.
           The D-psicose solution (5% SE) with 500 ppm 2,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid was then
15 evaluated for overall sweetness against 5%, 6.5%, and 7% sucrose solutions. The two panelists
   found that its overall sweetness was a little higher than 6.5% sucrose solution.
           The results showed that 2,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid acted as a sweetness enhancer for D
   psicose.

       Taste Evaluation
               Beverages were kept in the refrigerator overnight and tasted cold the following day. Two
 5     panelists evaluated the beverages. Bottles were removed from the refrigerator and about 20 ml of
       beverage poured in 2 oz- plastic cups. Mineral water was given for thorough palate rinsing
       before tasting and between tasting different samples. Unsalted crackers were also given.
               First, the panelists assessed the sweetness of 30 ppm 4-amino-5-(cyclohexyloxy)-2
       methylquinoline-3-carboxylic acid solution in citric acid buffer against 1%, 1.5% and 2%
10     sucrose solutions in citric acid buffer. The panelists found that 30 ppm of the above compound
       had sweetness below the sweetness of the 1% sucrose solution. Next, D-psicose (5% SE) in citric
       acid buffer solution was evaluated for its sweetness against 5% and 6% sucrose solutions, where
       it was found to be equally sweet to 5% sucrose in citric acid buffer solution.
               The solution containing D-psicose (5% SE) and 30 ppm 4-amino-5-(cyclohexyloxy)-2
15     methylquinoline-3-carboxylic acid was evaluated last against 5%, 6%, and 7% sucrose solutions,
       all in citric acid buffer. The two panelists found that its overall sweetness was more than 7%
       sucrose, around 7 .5 % sucrose solution.
               Four panelists evaluated the solution containing the sucrose and D-psicose blend with and
       without 30 ppm 4-amino-5-(cyclohexyloxy)-2-methylquinoline-3-carboxylic              acid.   Sucrose
20     (3.5%) and D-psicose (2% SE) in citric acid buffer solution was evaluated for its overall
       sweetness and was found to be around 5.5% SE. Next, panelists evaluated the sucrose and D
       psicose blend with the addition of 30 ppm 4-amino-5-(cyclohexyloxy)-2-methylquinoline-3

   carboxylic acid, using 8%, 9%, and 10% sucrose in citric acid buffer solutions as controls. All
   panelists found that the solution was sweeter than 10% sucrose control, about 10. 5 % SE.
            The experiment showed that D-psicose sweetness was enhanced by about 2.5% SE (50%
   enhancement) with 4-amino-5-(cyclohexyloxy)-2-methylquinoline-3-carboxylic acid when this
 5 compound was used at a level of 30 ppm , which provided no perceived sweetness when used
   alone. In addition, the total sweetness enhancement (10.5% sucrose) was greater than the sum of
   enhancement provided by 30 ppm 4-amino-5-(cyclohexyloxy)-2-methylquinoline-3-carboxylic
   when used in combination with the sugars individually (7% for sucrose, US Patent Application
   US20130041046A, and 3% SE for D-psicose).

            D-Tagatose was evaluated at its concentration equivalent to 5% sucrose equivalent (5%
   SE), or the concentration required to have the same sweetness as of a 5% sucrose solution.
15 FEMA GRAS FLAVOR 4701 was prepared according to PCT Application Publication No.
   W02010/014666. FEMA GRAS FLAVOR 4701 was used at 15 ppm, corresponding to its
   maximum value allowable in non-alcoholic beverages.
   The sweetness level of D-tagatose and FEMA GRAS FLAVOR 4701 was evaluated against 5%,
   6%, and 7% sucrose solutions. All solutions were made in citric acid/potassium citrate buffer
20          Solutions were prepared with the ingredients provided in Tables 23-25. All ingredients
   were dissolved in treated water. Citric acid and potassium citrate were added in a sufficient
   amount to bring the final pH to 3.2. Solutions were filled in 300ml-glass bottles and chilled in
   the refrigerator before tasting.

   EXAMPLE 9: D-Psicose as Taste Modulator for Steviol Glycosides in Lemon-Lime
   Carbonated Soft Drinks (CSD)
10 The performance of D-psicose in lemon lime CSD was evaluated to and assess whether this
   ingredient can modulate in a positive way the sweetness and taste brought by steviol glycosides
   (Rebaudioside A and Rebaudioside M), particularly by reducing or suppressing their sweet
   lingering, bitterness and licorice aftertaste. Lemon lime CSD were made with 1) sucrose, steviol
   glycosides and D-psicose (60% and 30% reduced calorie), 2) steviol glycosides and D-psicose
15 (zero calorie) and compared with full sugar one (control) in terms of overall sweetness and taste
   profile.
   Beverage Preparation
   Lemon lime CSD were made first by making syrup from which 1 part was mixed with 5.5 parts
20 of carbonated water to constitute a finished beverage with a carbonation of 3.7 volumes of
   carbon dioxide (C02). Dry ingredients were dissolved in the syrup water followed by dissolving
   the lemon lime flavor. Citric acid and buffer were added in a sufficient amount to bring pH to 3.3
   and total titratable acidity (TTA) to 0.117% w/v in finished beverages. Finished beverages were
   filled in 300ml-glass bottles and stored at ambient temperature for one week before taste
25 evaluation.
            Lemon-lime carbonated soft drinks were prepared with the ingredients provided in Tables
   26-29.

   Taste Evaluation
   A trained panel evaluated the 30% (n=14) and 60% reduced calorie lemon lime CSD (n=13),
   while the zero calorie lemon lime CSD was evaluated by an expert panel (n=3) made up of
   product developers. A triangle test was used to compare the 30% and 60% reduced calorie
10 beverages to the full sugar control. In each set, the trained panel was randomly given 3 samples
   in which two were the same and one different and asked to choose the one different. For the zero
   calorie lemon lime CSD, expert panelists were given evaluation sheets and asked to write
   comments on overall sweetness and taste profile. After one week at room temperature, beverages
   were refrigerated and served cold. Bottles were removed from the refrigerator and about 50 ml of
15 beverage poured in 4 oz- plastic cups. Panelists were given mineral water for mouth rinsing
   before tasting and between tasting different samples. Unsalted crackers were also given to
   panelists to eat followed by mouth-rinsing with mineral water before tasting the next sample.
           The triangle test where the 30% reduced calorie lemon lime CSD was compared to the
   full sugar control showed that among the 14 panelists, six chose the correct sample while eight
20 chose the incorrect sample as different (p-value 0.31). The triangle test on the 60% reduced
   calorie lemon lime in comparison with the full sugar control showed that among the 13 panelists,
   four chose the correct sample while 9 chose the incorrect sample as different (p-value 0.68).

   These results showed that the panelists could not detect differences between the reduced calorie
   lemon lime CSD formulated with D-psicose and Rebaudioside A and the full sugar control
   formulated with sucrose. At such low sugar content, Rebaudioside A sweet lingering, bitterness,
   licorice aftertaste and less mouth feel are easily detected. The results showed that D-psicose
 5 modulated Rebaudiose A and improved the overall sweetness and taste profile, making it
   possible to formulate beverages with fewer calories with improved taste.
           The evaluation of the zero calorie lemon lime CSD by the expert panel showed that it had
   a faster and more rounded sweetness and flavor profile, with very low sweet lingering and no
   bitterness or licorice aftertaste, showing that D-psicose helped reduce or eliminate these
10 unwanted characteristics.
