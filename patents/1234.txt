[0001]                    The entire disclosure in the complete specification of our Australian
Patent Application No. 2015264871 is by this cross-reference incorporated into the
present specification.
Background of the Invention
[0002]                    The complement system plays a central role in the clearance of
immune complexes and the immune response to infectious agents, foreign antigens,
virus-infected cells and tumor cells. However, complement is also involved in
pathological inflammation and in autoimmune diseases. Therefore, inhibition of
excessive or uncontrolled activation of the complement cascade could provide
clinical benefit to patients with such diseases and conditions.
[0003]                    The complement system encompasses two distinct activation
pathways, designated the classical and the alternative pathways (V.M. Holers, In
Clinical Immunology: Principles and Practice, ed. R.R. Rich, Mosby Press; 1996,
363-391). The classical pathway is a calcium/magnesium-dependent cascade which
is normally activated by the formation of antigen-antibody complexes. The
alternative pathway is a magnesium-dependent cascade which is activated by
deposition and activation of C3 on certain susceptible surfaces (e.g. cell wall
polysaccharides of yeast and bacteria, and certain biopolymer materials). Activation
of the complement pathway generates biologically active fragments of complement
proteins, e.g. C3a, C4a and C5a anaphylatoxins and C5b-9 membrane attack
complexes (MAC), which mediate inflammatory activities involving leukocyte
chemotaxis, activation of macrophages, neutrophils, platelets, mast cells and
endothelial cells, vascular permeability, cytolysis, and tissue injury.
[0004]                     Factor D is a highly specific serine protease essential for activation of
the alternative complement pathway. It cleaves factor B bound to C3b, generating
the C3b/Bb enzyme which is the active component of the alternative pathway C3/C5
convertases. Factor D may be a suitable target for inhibition, since its plasma
concentration in humans is very low (1.8 pg/ml), and it has been shown to be the
limiting enzyme for activation of the alternative complement pathway (P.H. Lesavre
and H.J. MOller-Eberhard. J. Exp. Med., 1978; 148: 1498-1510; J.E. Volanakis et al.,
New Eng. J. Med., 1985; 312: 395-401).

10119248_1(GHMatters) P80942.AU.3

[0005]                     The down-regulation of complement activation has been demonstrated
to be effective in treating several disease indications in animal models and in ex vivo
studies, e.g. systemic lupus erythematosus and glomerulonephritis (Y. Wang et al.,
Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.; 1996, 93: 8563-8568), rheumatoid arthritis (Y. Wang et al.,
Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., 1995; 92: 8955-8959), cardiopulmonary bypass and
hemodialysis (C.S. Rinder, J. Clin. Invest., 1995; 96: 1564-1572), hypercute
rejection in organ transplantation (T.J. Kroshus et al., Transplantation, 1995; 60:
1194-1202), myocardial infarction (J. W. Homeister et al., J. Immunol., 1993; 150:
1055-1064; H.F. Weisman et al., Science, 1990; 249: 146-151), reperfusion injury
(E.A. Amsterdam et al., Am. J. Physiol., 1995; 268: H448-H457), and adult
respiratory distress syndrome (R. Rabinovici et al., J. Immunol., 1992; 149: 1744
1750). In addition, other inflammatory conditions and autoimmune/immune complex
diseases are also closely associated with complement activation (V.M. Holers, ibid.,
B.P. Morgan. Eur. J. Clin. Invest., 1994: 24: 219-228), including thermal injury,
severe asthma, anaphylactic shock, bowel inflammation, urticaria, angioedema,
vasculitis, multiple sclerosis, myasthenia gravis, membranoproliferative
glomerulonephritis, and Sj6gren's syndrome.
[0006]                     There is a need for antibody therapeutics in the field of complement
mediated disorders and the humanized antibodies of the present invention provide
high affinity antibodies useful to meet this need.
[0007]                      It is to be understood that if any prior art publication is referred to
herein such reference does not constitute an admission that the publication forms a
part of the common general knowledge in the art, in Australia or any other country.
Summary of the Invention
[0008]                     The present invention relates generally to antibodies comprising the
heavy and light chain variable domain sequences of murine antibody 166-32, which
is an antibody capable of inhibiting biological activities associated with Factor D. For
example, at a concentration of 18 pLg/ml (equivalent to about 1.5 times the molar
concentration of human factor D in the blood; molar ratio of anti-Factor D antibody to
Factor D of about 1.5:1), significant inhibition of the alternative complement activity
by the antibody can be observed (see, e.g., US Patent No. 6,956,107)
[0009]                     The present invention also relates to humanized antibodies of murine
MAb 166-32. The invention includes the amino acid sequences of the variable
                                                           2

heavy and light chain of the antibodies and their corresponding nucleic acid
sequences. Another embodiment of the invention includes the CDR sequences of
these antibodies.
[00010]                    Another embodiment of the present invention includes compositions
comprising an antibody of the invention. In another embodiment, the invention
provides cell lines and vectors harboring the antibody sequences of the present
invention. In one aspect, the invention includes method of making and using
antibodies and compositions of the invention.
[00011]                    Another embodiment of the preset invention is the use of these
humanized antibodies for the preparation of a medicament or composition for the
treatment of disorders associated with excessive or uncontrolled complement
activation. They include complement activation during cardiopulmonary bypass
operations; complement activation due to ischemia-reperfusion following acute
myocardial infarction, aneurysm, stroke, hemorrhagic shock, crush injury, multiple
organ failure, hypobolemic shock, intestinal ischemia or other events causing
ischemia. Complement activation has also been shown to be associated with
inflammatory conditions such as severe burns, endotoxemia, septic shock, adult
respiratory distress syndrome, hemodialysis; anaphylactic shock, severe asthma,
angioedema, Crohn's disease, sickle cell anemia, poststreptococcal
glomerulonephritis and pancreatitis. The disorder may be the result of an adverse
drug reaction, drug allergy, IL-2 induced vascular leakage syndrome or radiographic
contrast media allergy. It also includes autoimmune disease such as systemic lupus
erythematosus, myasthenia gravis, rheumatoid arthritis, Alzheimer's disease and
multiple sclerosis. Complement activation is also associated with transplant
rejection.Complement activation is also associated with ocular diseases such as
age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy.

Detailed Description of the Invention
Definitions
[00020]                     In the claims which follow and in the description of the invention,
except where the context requires otherwise due to express language or necessary
implication, the word "comprise" or variations such as "comprises" or "comprising" is
used in an inclusive sense, i.e. to specify the presence of the stated features but not
to preclude the presence or addition of further features in various embodiments of
the invention.
[00021]                    Terms used throughout this application are to be construed with
ordinary and typical meaning to those of ordinary skill in the art. However,
Applicants desire that the following terms be given the particular definition as defined
below.
[00022]                    The phrase "substantially identical" with respect to an antibody chain
polypeptide sequence may be construed as an antibody chain exhibiting at least
70%, or 80%, or 90% or 95% sequence identity to the reference polypeptide
sequence. The term with respect to a nucleic acid sequence may be construed as a
sequence of nucleotides exhibiting at least about 85%, or 90%, or 95% or 97%
sequence identity to the reference nucleic acid sequence.
[00023]                    The term "identity" or "homology" shall be construed to mean the
percentage of amino acid residues in the candidate sequence that are identical with
the residue of a corresponding sequence to which it is compared, after aligning the
sequences and introducing gaps, if necessary to achieve the maximum percent
identity for the entire sequence, and not considering any conservative substitutions
as part of the sequence identity. Neither N- or C-terminal extensions nor insertions
shall be construed as reducing identity or homology. Methods and computer
programs for the alignment are well known in the art. Sequence identity may be
measured using sequence analysis software.
[00024]                    The term "antibody" is used in the broadest sense, and specifically
covers monoclonal antibodies (including full length monoclonal antibodies),
polyclonal antibodies, and multispecific antibodies (e.g., bispecific antibodies).
Antibodies (Abs) and immunoglobulins (Igs) are glycoproteins having the same
structural characteristics. While antibodies exhibit binding specificity to a specific
target, immunoglobulins include both antibodies and other antibody-like molecules
                                                         5
10119248_1 (GHMatters) P80942.AU.3

which lack target specificity. Native antibodies and immunoglobulins are usually
heterotetrameric glycoproteins of about 150,000 daltons, composed of two identical
light (L) chains and two identical heavy (H) chains. Each heavy chain has at one
end a variable domain (VH) followed by a number of constant domains. Each light
chain has a variable domain at one end (VL) and a constant domain at its other end.
[00025]                    As used herein, "anti-human Factor D antibody" means an antibody
which specifically binds to human Factor D in such a manner so as to inhibit or
substantially reduce complement activation.
[00026]                    The term "variable" in the context of variable domain of antibodies,
refers to the fact that certain portions of the variable domains differ extensively in
sequence among antibodies and are used in the binding and specificity of each
particular antibody for its particular target. However, the variability is not evenly
distributed through the variable domains of antibodies. It is concentrated in three
segments called complementarity determining regions (CDRs) also known as
hypervariable regions (HVRs) both in the light chain and the heavy chain variable
domains. The more highly conserved portions of variable domains are called the
framework (FR). The variable domains of native heavy and light chains each
comprise four FR regions, largely a adopting a fbhe et configuration, connected by
three CDRs, which form loops connecting, and in some cases forming part of, the P
sheet structure. The CDRs in each chain are held together in close proximity by the
FR regions and, with the CDRs from the other chain, contribute to the formation of
the target binding site of antibodies (see Kabat et al.). As used herein, numbering of
immunoglobulin amino acid residues is done according to the immunoglobulin amino
acid residue numbering system of Kabat et al., (Sequences of Proteins of
Immunological Interest, National Institute of Health, Bethesda, Md. 1987), unless
otherwise indicated.
[00027]                    The term "hypervariable region", "HVR", or "HV", when used herein
refers to the regions of an antibody variable domain which are hypervariable in
sequence and/or form structurally defined loops. Generally, antibodies comprise six
hypervariable regions; three in the VH (H1, H2, H3), and three in the VL (L1, L2, L3).
A number of hypervariable region delineations are in use and are encompassed
herein. The Kabat Complementarity Determining Regions (CDRs) are based on
sequence variability and are the most commonly used (Kabat et al., Sequences of
                                                        6

Proteins of Immunological Interest, 5th Ed. Public Health Service, National Institutes
of Health, Bethesda, MD. (1991)). Chothia refers instead to the location of the
structural loops (Chothia and Lesk J. Mol. Biol. 196:901-917 (1987)). The AbM
hypervariable regions represent a compromise between the Kabat CDRs and
Chothia structural loops, and are used by Oxford Molecular's AbM antibody modeling
software. The "contact" hypervariable regions are based on an analysis of the
available complex crystal structures. The residues from each of these hypervariable
regions are noted below.

[00028]                     Hypervariable regions may comprise "extended hypervariable regions"
as follows: 24-36 or 24-34 (L1), 46-56 or 50-56 (L2) and 89-97 (L3) in the VL and 26
35 (Hi), 50-65 or 49-65 (H2) and 93-102, 94-102 or 95-102 (H3) in the VH. The
variable domain residues are numbered according to Kabat et al., supra for each of
these definitions.
[00029]                     "Framework" or "FR" residues are those variable domain residues other
than the hypervariable region residues or CDR residues herein defined.
[00030]                    The term "variable domain residue numbering as in Kabat" or "amino
acid position numbering as in Kabat", and variations thereof, refers to the numbering
system used for heavy chain variable domains or light chain variable domains of the
compilation of antibodies in Kabat et al., Sequences of Proteins of Immunological
Interest, 5th Ed. Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.
                                                       7
10119248_1 (GHMatters) P80942.AU.3

(1991). Using this numbering system, the actual linear amino acid sequence may
contain fewer or additional amino acids corresponding to a shortening of, or insertion
into, a FR or CDR of the variable domain. For example, a heavy chain variable
domain may include a single amino acid insert (residue 52a according to Kabat) after
residue 52 of H2 and inserted residues (e.g. residues 82a, 82b, and 82c, etc
according to Kabat) after heavy chain FR residue 82. The Kabat numbering of
residues may be determined for a given antibody by alignment at regions of
homology of the sequence of the antibody with a "standard" Kabat numbered
sequence.
[00031]                    The Kabat numbering system is generally used when referring to a
residue in the variable domain (approximately residues 1-107 of the light chain and
residues 1-113 of the heavy chain) (e.g, Kabat et al., Sequences of Immunological
Interest. 5th Ed. Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md.
(1991)). The "EU numbering system" or "EU index" is generally used when referring
to a residue in an immunoglobulin heavy chain constant region (e.g., the EU index
reported in Kabat et al., supra; hinge region in constant domain of heavy chain is
approximately residues 216-230 (EU numbering) of the heavy chain). The "EU index
as in Kabat" refers to the residue numbering of the human IgG1 EU antibody.
Unless stated otherwise herein, references to residue numbers in the variable
domain of antibodies means residue numbering by the Kabat numbering system.
Unless stated otherwise herein, references to residue numbers in the constant
domain of antibodies means residue numbering by the EU numbering system (e.g.,
see United States Provisional Application No. 60/640,323, Figures for EU
numbering).
[00032]                    The term "antibody fragment" refers to a portion of a full-length
antibody, generally the target binding or variable region. Examples of antibody
fragments include Fab, Fab', F(ab') 2 and Fv fragments. The phrase "functional
fragment or analog" of an antibody is a compound having qualitative biological
activity in common with a full-length antibody. For example, a functional fragment or
analog of an anti-human Factor D antibody is one which can bind to Factor D in such
a manner so as to prevent or substantially reduce the complement activation. As
used herein, "functional fragment" with respect to antibodies, refers to Fv, F(ab) and
                                                      8
10119248_1 (GHMatters) P80942.AU.3

F(ab') 2 fragments. An "Fv" fragment is the minimum antibody fragment which
contains a complete target recognition and binding site. This region consists of a
dimer of one heavy and one light chain variable domain in a tight, non-covalent
association              (VH -VL   dimer). It is in this configuration that the three CDRs of each
variable domain interact to define an target binding site on the surface of the                VH -VL
dimer. Collectively, the six CDRs confer target binding specificity to the antibody.
However, even a single variable domain (or half of an Fv comprising only three
CDRs specific for an target) has the ability to recognize and bind target. "Single
chain Fv" or "sFv" antibody fragments comprise the                     VH and VL domains of an
antibody, wherein these domains are present in a single polypeptide chain.
Generally, the Fv polypeptide further comprises a polypeptide linker between the                   VH
and VL domains which enables the sFv to form the desired structure for target
binding.
[00033]                     The Fab fragment contains the constant domain of the light chain and
the first constant domain (CH1) of the heavy chain. Fab' fragments differ from Fab
fragments by the addition of a few residues at the carboxyl terminus of the heavy
chain CH1 domain including one or more cysteines from the antibody hinge region.
F(ab') fragments are produced by cleavage of the disulfide bond at the hinge
cysteines of the F(ab') 2 pepsin digestion product. Additional chemical couplings of
antibody fragments are known to those of ordinary skill in the art.
[00034]                     The term "monoclonal antibody" as used herein refers to an antibody
obtained from a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies, i.e., the
individual antibodies comprising the population are identical except for possible
naturally occurring mutations that may be present in minor amounts. Monoclonal
antibodies are highly specific, being directed against a single targetic site.
Furthermore, in contrast to conventional (polyclonal) antibody preparations which
typically include different antibodies directed against different determinants
(epitopes), each monoclonal antibody is directed against a single determinant on the
target. In addition to their specificity, monoclonal antibodies are advantageous in
that they may be synthesized by the hybridoma culture, uncontaminated by other
immunoglobulins. The modifier "monoclonal" indicates the character of the antibody
as being obtained from a substantially homogeneous population of antibodies, and is
not to be construed as requiring production of the antibody by any particular method.
                                                            9
10119248_1 (GHMatters) P80942.AU.3

For example, the monoclonal antibodies for use with the present invention may be
isolated from phage antibody libraries using the well known techniques. The parent
monoclonal antibodies to be used in accordance with the present invention may be
made by the hybridoma method first described by Kohler and Milstein, Nature 256,
495 (1975), or may be made by recombinant methods.
[00035]                     "Humanized" forms of non-human (e.g. murine) antibodies are chimeric
immunoglobulins, immunoglobulin chains or fragments thereof (such as Fv, Fab,
Fab', F(ab') 2 or other target-binding subsequences of antibodies) which contain
minimal sequence derived from non-human immunoglobulin. In general, the
humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one, and typically two,
variable domains, in which all or substantially all of the CDR regions correspond to
those of a non-human immunoglobulin and all or substantially all of the FR regions
are those of a human immunoglobulin consensus sequence. The humanized
antibody may also comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region
(Fc), typically that of a human immunoglobulin template chosen.
[00036]                     Methods for humanizing non-human antibodies are well known in the
art. Generally, a humanized antibody has one or more amino acid residues
introduced into it from a source which is non-human. These non-human amino acid
residues are often referred to as "import" residues, which are typically taken from an
"import" variable domain. Humanization can be essentially performed following the
method of Winter and co-workers [Jones et al., Nature, 321:522-525 (1986);
Riechmann et al., Nature, 332:323-327 (1988); Verhoeyen et al., Science, 239:1534
1536 (1988)], by substituting rodent CDRs or CDR sequences for the corresponding
sequences of a human antibody. Accordingly, such "humanized" antibodies are
chimeric antibodies (U.S. Patent No. 4,816,567), wherein substantially less than an
intact human variable domain has been substituted by the corresponding sequence
from a non-human species. In practice, humanized antibodies are typically human
antibodies in which some CDR residues and possibly some FR residues are
substituted by residues from analogous sites in rodent antibodies.
[00037]                    The choice of human variable domains, both light and heavy, to be
used in making the humanized antibodies can in some instances be important to
reduce antigenicity and/or HAMA response (human anti-mouse antibody) when the
antibody is intended for human therapeutic use. Reduction or elimination of a HAMA
                                                      10

response is generally a significant aspect of clinical development of suitable
therapeutic agents. See, e.g., Khaxzaeli et al., J. Nati. Cancer Inst. (1988), 80:937;
Jaffers et al., Transplantation (1986), 41:572; Shawler et al., J. Immunol. (1985),
135:1530; Sears et al., J. Biol. Response Mod. (1984), 3:138; Miller et al., Blood
(1983), 62:988; Hakimi et al., J. Immunol. (1991), 147:1352; Reichmann et al.,
Nature (1988), 332:323; Junghans et al., Cancer Res. (1990), 50:1495. As
described herein, the invention provides antibodies that are humanized such that
HAMA response is reduced or eliminated. Variants of these antibodies can further
be obtained using routine methods known in the art, some of which are further
described below. According to the so-called "best-fit" method, the sequence of the
variable domain of a rodent antibody is screened against the entire library of known
human variable domain sequences. The human V domain sequence which is
closest to that of the rodent is identified and the human framework region (FR) within
it accepted for the humanized antibody (Sims et al., J. Immunol. 151:2296 (1993);
Chothia et al., J. Mol. Biol., 196:901 (1987)). Another method uses a particular
framework region derived from the consensus sequence of all human antibodies of a
particular subgroup of light or heavy chains. The same framework may be used for
several different humanized antibodies (Carter et al., Proc. Nati. Acad. Sci. USA,
89:4285 (1992); Presta et al., J. Immunol. 151:2623 (1993)).
[00038]                    For example, an amino acid sequence from an antibody as described
herein can serve as a starting (parent) sequence for diversification of the framework
and/or hypervariable sequence(s). A selected framework sequence to which a
starting hypervariable sequence is linked is referred to herein as an acceptor human
framework. While the acceptor human frameworks may be from, or derived from, a
human immunoglobulin (the VL and/or VH regions thereof), the acceptor human
frameworks may be from, or derived from, a human consensus framework sequence
as such frameworks have been demonstrated to have minimal, or no,
immunogenicity in human patients. An "acceptor human framework" for the
purposes herein is a framework comprising the amino acid sequence of a VL or VH
framework derived from a human immunoglobulin framework, or from a human
consensus framework. An acceptor human framework "derived from" a human
immunoglobulin framework or human consensus framework may comprise the same
amino acid sequence thereof, or may contain pre-existing amino acid sequence
                                                     11
10119248_1(GHMatters) P80942.AU.3

changes. Where pre-existing amino acid changes are present, preferably no more
than 5 and preferably 4 or less, or 3 or less, pre-existing amino acid changes are
present. In one embodiment, the VH acceptor human framework is identical in
sequence to the VH human immunoglobulin framework sequence or human
consensus framework sequence. In one embodiment, the VL acceptor human
framework is identical in sequence to the VL human immunoglobulin framework
sequence or human consensus framework sequence. A "human consensus
framework" is a framework which represents the most commonly occurring amino
acid residue in a selection of human immunoglobulin VL or VH framework
sequences. Generally, the selection of human immunoglobulin VL or VH sequences
is from a subgroup of variable domain sequences. Generally, the subgroup of
sequences is a subgroup as in Kabat et al. In one embodiment, for the VL, the
subgroup is subgroup kappa I as in Kabat et al. In one embodiment, for the VH, the
subgroup is subgroup III as in Kabat et al.
[00039]                     Where the acceptor is derived from a human immunoglobulin, one may
optionally select a human framework sequence that is selected based on its
homology to the donor framework sequence by aligning the donor framework
sequence with various human framework sequences in a collection of human
framework sequences, and select the most homologous framework sequence as the
acceptor. The acceptor human framework may be from or derived from human
antibody germline sequences available in the public databases.
[00040]                     In one embodiment, human consensus frameworks herein are from, or
derived from, VH subgroup VII and/or VL kappa subgroup I consensus framework
sequences.
[00041]                     In one embodiment, the human framework template used for
generation of an anti-Factor D antibody may comprise framework sequences from a
template comprising a combination of VI-4.1 b+ (VH7 family) and JH4d for VH chain
(Figure 3) and/or a combination of DPK4 (VIl family) and JK2 for VL chain (Figure
4).
[00042]                    Thus, the VH acceptor human framework may comprise one, two,
three or all of the following framework sequences: FR1 comprising
QX 1QLVQSGX 2ELKKPGASVKVSCKAS (amino acids 1-25 of SEQ ID NO: 27),
wherein X, is I or V, X2 is P or S; FR2 comprising WVX 3QAPGQGLE (amino acids

[00048]                    While the acceptor may be identical in sequence to the human
framework sequence selected, whether that be from a human immunoglobulin or a
human consensus framework, the present invention contemplates that the acceptor
sequence may comprise pre-existing amino acid substitutions relative to the human
immunoglobulin sequence or human consensus framework sequence. These pre
existing substitutions are preferably minimal; usually four, three, two or one amino

framework sequence.
[00049]                     Hypervariable region residues of the non-human antibody are
incorporated into the VL and/or VH acceptor human frameworks. For example, one
may incorporate residues corresponding to the Kabat CDR residues, the Chothia
hypervariable loop residues, the Abm residues, and/or contact residues. Optionally,
the extended hypervariable region residues as follows are incorporated: 24-34 (L1),

an antibody comprising that amino acid sequence retains the ability to bind to Factor
D. In some embodiments, a total of 1 to 10 amino acids have been substituted,
inserted, or deleted in a sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO:

[00055]                    An anti-Factor D antibody may comprise any suitable framework
variable domain sequence, provided that the antibody retains the ability to bind
Factor D. For example, in some embodiments, anti-Factor D antibodies of the
invention comprise a heavy chain variable domain framework sequence that is a
combination of VI.4.1 b+ and JH4d (See Figure 3). In some embodiments, anti
Factor D antibodies of the invention comprise a human subgroup VII heavy chain
framework consensus sequence. In some embodiments, anti-Factor D antibodies of
the invention comprise a heavy chain variable domain framework sequence

embodiment of these antibodies, position 40 is cysteine (C) or alanine (A) and/or
position 88 is cysteine (C) or alanine (A). In some embodiments, anti-Factor D
antibodies of the invention comprise a light chain variable domain framework

[00056]                     Further, an anti-Factor D antibody may comprise any suitable constant
domain sequence, provided that the antibody retains the ability to bind Factor D. For
example, in some embodiments, anti-Factor D antibodies of the invention comprise
at least a portion of a heavy chain constant domain. In one embodiment, anti-Factor
D antibodies of the invention comprise a heavy chain constant domain of either one
or a combination of an qxFyor pheavy chain                      . Depending on the amino acid
sequence of the constant domain of their heavy chains (CH), immunoglobulins can
be assigned to different classes or isotypes. There are five classes of
immunoglobulins: IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM, having heavy chains designated (D
  yand p respectively. The \and cclasses are                     further divided into subclasses on
the basis of relatively minor differences in CH sequence and function, e.g., humans
express the following subclasses: IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgAl, and IgA2. In one
embodiment, anti-Factor D antibodies of the invention comprise a heavy chain
constant domain comprising substitutions at amino acid positions that results in a
desired effect on effector function (e.g.. binding affinity). In one embodiment, anti

[00070]                    As is well-established in the art, binding affinity of a ligand to its
receptor can be determined using any of a variety of assays, and expressed in terms
of a variety of quantitative values. Accordingly, in one embodiment, the binding
affinity is expressed as Kd values and reflects intrinsic binding affinity (e.g., with
minimized avidity effects). Generally and preferably, binding affinity is measured in
vitro, whether in a cell-free or cell-associated setting. As described in greater detail
herein, fold difference in binding affinity can be quantified in terms of the ratio of the
monovalent binding affinity value of a humanized antibody (e.g., in Fab form) and the
monovalent binding affinity value of a reference/comparator antibody (e.g., in Fab
form) (e.g., a murine antibody having donor hypervariable region sequences),
wherein the binding affinity values are determined under similar assay conditions.
Thus, in one embodiment, the fold difference in binding affinity is determined as the
ratio of the Kd values of the humanized antibody in Fab form and said
reference/comparator Fab antibody. For example, in one embodiment, if an
antibody of the invention (A) has an affinity that is "3-fold lower" than the affinity of a
reference antibody (M), then if the Kd value for A is 3x, the Kd value of M would be
1x, and the ratio of Kd of A to Kd of M would be 3:1. Conversely, in one
embodiment, if an antibody of the invention (C) has an affinity that is "3-fold greater"
than the affinity of a reference antibody (R), then if the Kd value for C is 1x, the Kd
                                                        25
10119248_1 (GHMatters) P80942.AU.3

value of R would be 3x, and the ratio of Kd of C to Kd of R would be 1:3. Any of a
number of assays known in the art, including those described herein, can be used to
obtain binding affinity measurements, including, for example, Biacore,
radioimmunoassay (RIA) and ELISA.
[00071]                     Further, Kd values for an antibody of the invention may vary depending
on conditions of the particular assay used. For example, in one embodiment,
binding affinity measurements may be obtained in an assay wherein the Fab or
antibody is immobilized and binding of the ligand, i.e. Factor D, is measured or
alternatively, the ligand, i.e. Factor D, for the Fab or antibody is immobilized and
binding of the Fab or antibody is measured. In one embodiment, the binding affinity
measurements may be obtained in an assay wherein the regeneration conditions
may comprise (1) 10mM glycein or 4M MgCl 2 at pH 1.5, and (2) pH between pH of
1.0 and pH of 7.5, including pH of 1.5, pH of 5.0, pH of 6.0 and pH of 7.2.                  In one
embodiment, the binding affinity measurements may be obtained in an assay
wherein the binding conditions may comprise (1) PBS or HEPES-buffered saline and
(2) Tween-20, i.e. 0.1% Tween-20. In one embodiment, the binding affinity
measurements may be obtained in an assay wherein the source of the ligand, i.e
Factor D, may be from commercially available sources. In one embodiment, binding
affinity measurements may be obtained in an assay wherein (1) the Fab or antibody
is immobilized and binding of the ligand, i.e. Factor D is measured, (2) the
regeneration conditions comprise 4M MgCl 2 at pH 7.2 and (3) the binding conditions
comprise HEPES-buffered saline, pH 7.2 containing 0.1% Tween-20. In one
embodiment, binding affinity measurements may be obtained in an assay wherein
(1) the ligand, i.e. Factor D, is immobilized and binding of the Fab or antibody is
measured, (2) the regeneration conditions comprise 10mM glycine at pH 1.5 and (3)
the binding conditions comprise PBS buffer.
[00072]                    The terms "cell", "cell line" and "cell culture" include progeny. It is also
understood that all progeny may not be precisely identical in DNA content, due to
deliberate or inadvertent mutations. Variant progeny that have the same function or
biological property, as screened for in the originally transformed cell, are included.
The "host cells" used in the present invention generally are prokaryotic or eukaryotic
hosts.

10119248_1 (GHMatters) P80942.AU.3

[00073]                    The term "vector" means a DNA construct containing a DNA sequence
which is operably linked to a suitable control sequence capable of effecting the
expression of the DNA in a suitable host. Such control sequences include a
promoter to effect transcription, an optional operator sequence to control such
transcription, a sequence encoding suitable mRNA ribosome binding sites, and
sequences which control the termination of transcription and translation. The vector
may be a plasmid, a phage particle, or simply a potential genomic insert. Once
transformed into a suitable host, the vector may replicate and function independently
of the host genome, or may in some instances, integrate into the genome itself. In
the present specification, "plasmid" and "vector" are sometimes used
interchangeably, as the plasmid is the most commonly used form of vector.
However, the invention is intended to include such other forms of vectors which
serve equivalent function as and which are, or become, known in the art.
[00074]                    The word "label" when used herein refers to a detectable compound or
composition which can be conjugated directly or indirectly to a molecule or protein,
e.g., an antibody. The label may itself be detectable (e.g., radioisotope labels or
fluorescent labels) or, in the case of an enzymatic label, may catalyze chemical
alteration of a substrate compound or composition which is detectable.
[00075]                    As used herein, "solid phase" means a non-aqueous matrix to which
the antibody of the present invention can adhere. Example of solid phases
encompassed herein include those formed partially or entirely of glass (e.g.
controlled pore glass), polysaccharides (e.g., agarose), polyacrylamides,
polystyrene, polyvinyl alcohol and silicones. In certain embodiments, depending on
the context, the solid phase can comprise the well of an assay plate; in others it is a
purification column (e.g. an affinity chromatography column).

SELECTION AND TRANSFORMATION OF HOST CELLS
[00076]                     Suitable host cells for cloning or expressing the DNA in the vectors
herein are prokaryotic, yeast, or higher eukaryotic cells. Suitable prokaryotes for this
purpose include both Gram-negative and Gram-positive organisms, for example,
Enterobacteria such as E. coli, Enterobacter, Erwinia, Klebsiella, Proteus,
Salmonella, Serratia, and Shigella, as well as Bacilli, Pseudomonas, and
                                                          27

Streptomyces. One preferred E. coli cloning host is E. coli 294 (ATCC 31,446),
although other strains such as E. coli B, E. coli X1 776 (ATCC 31,537), and E. coli
W3110 (ATCC 27,325) are suitable. These examples are illustrative rather than
limiting.
[00077]                     In addition to prokaryotes, eukaryotic microbes such as filamentous
fungi or yeast are suitable cloning or expression hosts for antibody-encoding vectors.
Saccharomyces cerevisiae is the most commonly used among lower eukaryotic host
microorganisms. However, a number of other genera, species, and strains are
commonly available and useful herein, such as Schizosaccharomyces pombe;
Kluyveromyces; Candida; Trichoderma; Neurospora crassa; and filamentous fungi
such as e.g., Neurospora, Penicillium, Tolypocladium, and Aspergillus hosts, such
as A. nidulans and A. niger.
[00078]                     Suitable host cells for the expression of glycosylated antibodies are
derived from multicellular organisms. In principal, any higher eukaryotic cell culture
is workable, whether from vertebrate or invertebrate culture. Examples of
invertebrate cells include plant and insect cells, Luckow et al., Bio/Technology 6, 47
55 (1988); Miller et al., Genetic Engineering, Setlow et al. eds. Vol. 8, pp. 277-279
(Plenam publishing 1986); Mseda et al., Nature 315, 592-594 (1985). Numerous
baculoviral strains and variants and corresponding permissive insect host cells from
hosts such as Spodoptera frugiperda (caterpillar), Aedes (mosquito), Drosophila
melanogaster (fruitfly), and Bombyx mori have been identified. A variety of viral
strains for transfection are publicly available, e.g., the L-1 variant of Autographa
californica NPV and the Bm-5 strain of Bombyx mori NPV, and such viruses may be
used as the virus herein according to the present invention, particularly for
transfection of Spodoptera frugiperda cells. Moreover, plant cells cultures of cotton,
corn, potato, soybean, petunia, tomato, and tobacco and also be utilized as hosts.
[00079]                    Vertebrate cells, and propagation of vertebrate cells, in culture (tissue
culture) has become a routine procedure. See Tissue Culture, Academic Press,

monkey kidney; human embryonic kidney line; baby hamster kidney cells; Chinese
hamster ovary cells/-DHFR (CHO, Urlaub et al., Proc. Nati. Acad. Sci. USA 77: 4216

[00080]                     Host cells are transformed with the above-described vectors for
antibody production and cultured in conventional nutrient media modified as
appropriate for inducing promoters, selecting transformants, or amplifying the genes
encoding the desired sequences.
[00081]                    The host cells used to produce the antibody variant of this invention
may be cultured in a variety of media. Commercially available media such as Ham's
F10 (Sigma), Minimal Essential Medium (MEM, Sigma), RPMI-1640 (Sigma), and
Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM, Sigma) are suitable for culturing host
cells. In addition, any of the media described in Ham et al., Meth. Enzymol. 58: 44
(1979), Barnes et al., Anal. Biochem. 102: 255 (1980), U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,767,704;
4,657,866; 4,560,655; 5,122,469; 5,712,163; or 6,048,728 may be used as culture
media for the host cells. Any of these media may be supplemented as necessary
with hormones and/or other growth factors (such as insulin, transferrin, or epidermal
growth factor), salts (such as X-chlorides, where X is sodium, calcium, magnesium;
and phosphates), buffers (such as HEPES), nucleotides (such as adenosine and
thymidine), antibiotics (such as GENTAMYCIN.TM. drug), trace elements (defined as
inorganic compounds usually present at final concentrations in the micromolar
range), and glucose or an equivalent energy source. Any other necessary
supplements may also be included at appropriate concentrations that would be
known to those skilled in the art. The culture conditions, such as temperature, pH,
and the like, are those previously used with the host cell selected for expression, and
will be apparent to the ordinarily skilled artisan.
ANTIBODY PURIFICATION
[00082]                    When using recombinant techniques, the antibody can be produced
intracellularly, in the periplasmic space, or directly secreted into the medium. If the
antibody variant is produced intracellularly, as a first step, the particulate debris,
either host cells or lysed fragments, may be removed, for example, by centrifugation
or ultrafiltration. Carter et al., Bio/Technology 10: 163-167 (1992) describe a
procedure for isolating antibodies which are secreted to the periplasmic space of E.
coli. Briefly, cell paste is thawed in the presence of sodium acetate (pH 3.5), EDTA,
and phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride (PMSF) over about 30 minutes. Cell debris can be
removed by centrifugation. Where the antibody variant is secreted into the medium,
supernatants from such expression systems are generally first concentrated using a
                                                       29
10119248_1 (GHMatters) P80942.AU.3

commercially available protein concentration filter, for example, an Amicon or
Millipore Pellicon ultrafiltration unit. A protease inhibitor such as PMSF may be
included in any of the foregoing steps to inhibit proteolysis and antibiotics may be
included to prevent the growth of adventitious contaminants.
[00083]                    The antibody composition prepared from the cells can be purified
using, for example, hydroxylapatite chromatography, gel elecrophoresis, dialysis,
and affinity chromatography, with affinity chromatography being the preferred
purification technique. The suitability of protein A as an affinity ligand depends on
the species and isotype of any immunoglobulin Fc domain that is present in the
antibody variant. Protein A can be used to purify antibodies that are based on human
IgG1, IgG2 or IgG4 heavy chains (Lindmark et al., J. Immunol Meth. 62: 1-13
(1983)). Protein G is recommended for all mouse isotypes and for human IgG3
(Guss et al., EMBO J. 5: 1567-1575 (1986)). The matrix to which the affinity ligand
is attached is most often agarose, but other matrices are available. Mechanically
stable matrices such as controlled pore glass or poly(styrenedivinyl)benzene allow
for faster flow rates and shorter processing times than can be achieved with
agarose. Where the antibody variant comprises a CH3 domain, the Bakerbond
ABXTM resin (J. T. Baker, Phillipsburg, N.J.) is useful for purification. Other
techniques for protein purification such as fractionation on an ion-exchange column,
ethanol precipitation, Reverse Phase HPLC, chromatography on silica,
chromatography on heparin SEPHAROSE TM chromatography on an anion or cation
exchange resin (such as a polyaspartic acid column), chromatofocusing, SDS
PAGE, and ammonium sulfate precipitation are also available depending on the
antibody variant to be recovered.
[00084]                     Following any preliminary purification step(s), the mixture comprising
the antibody variant of interest and contaminants may be subjected to low pH
hydrophobic interaction chromatography using an elution buffer at a pH between
about 2.5-4.5, preferably performed at low salt concentrations (e.g., from about 0
0.25M salt).
PHARMACEUTICAL FORMULATIONS
[00085]                    Therapeutic formulations of the polypeptide or antibody may be
prepared for storage as lyophilized formulations or aqueous solutions by mixing the
polypeptide having the desired degree of purity with optional "pharmaceutically
                                                       30

acceptable" carriers, excipients or stabilizers typically employed in the art (all of
which are termed "excipients"). For example, buffering agents, stabilizing agents,
preservatives, isotonifiers, non-ionic detergents, antioxidants and other
miscellaneous additives. (See Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 16th edition,
A. Osol, Ed. (1980)). Such additives must be nontoxic to the recipients at the
dosages and concentrations employed.
[00086]                     Buffering agents help to maintain the pH in the range which
approximates physiological conditions. They are preferably present at concentration
ranging from about 2 mM to about 50 mM. Suitable buffering agents for use with the
present invention include both organic and inorganic acids and salts thereof such as
citrate buffers (e.g., monosodium citrate-disodium citrate mixture, citric acid
trisodium citrate mixture, citric acid-monosodium citrate mixture, etc.), succinate
buffers (e.g., succinic acid-monosodium succinate mixture, succinic acid-sodium
hydroxide mixture, succinic acid-disodium succinate mixture, etc.), tartrate buffers
(e.g., tartaric acid-sodium tartrate mixture, tartaric acid-potassium tartrate mixture,
tartaric acid-sodium hydroxide mixture, etc.), fumarate buffers (e.g., fumaric acid
monosodium fumarate mixture, etc.), fumarate buffers (e.g., fumaric acid
monosodium fumarate mixture, fumaric acid-disodium fumarate mixture,
monosodium fumarate-disodium fumarate mixture, etc.), gluconate buffers (e.g.,
gluconic acid-sodium glyconate mixture, gluconic acid-sodium hydroxide mixture,
gluconic acid-potassium glyuconate mixture, etc.), oxalate buffer (e.g., oxalic acid
sodium oxalate mixture, oxalic acid-sodium hydroxide mixture, oxalic acid-potassium
oxalate mixture, etc.), lactate buffers (e.g., lactic acid-sodium lactate mixture, lactic
acid-sodium hydroxide mixture, lactic acid-potassium lactate mixture, etc.) and
acetate buffers (e.g., acetic acid-sodium acetate mixture, acetic acid-sodium
hydroxide mixture, etc.). Additionally, there may be mentioned phosphate buffers,
histidine buffers and trimethylamine salts such as Tris.
[00087]                     Preservatives may be added to retard microbial growth, and may be
added in amounts ranging from 0.2%-1 % (w/v). Suitable preservatives for use with
the present invention include phenol, benzyl alcohol, meta-cresol, methyl paraben,
propyl paraben, octadecyldimethylbenzyl ammonium chloride, benzalconium halides
(e.g., chloride, bromide, iodide), hexamethonium chloride, alkyl parabens such as
methyl or propyl paraben, catechol, resorcinol, cyclohexanol, and 3-pentanol.

[00088]                     Isotonicifiers sometimes known as "stabilizers" may be added to
ensure isotonicity of liquid compositions of the present invention and include
polhydric sugar alcohols, preferably trihydric or higher sugar alcohols, such as
glycerin, erythritol, arabitol, xylitol, sorbitol and mannitol.
[00089]                     Stabilizers refer to a broad category of excipients which can range in
function from a bulking agent to an additive which solubilizes the therapeutic agent
or helps to prevent denaturation or adherence to the container wall. Typical
stabilizers can be polyhydric sugar alcohols (enumerated above); amino acids such
as arginine, lysine, glycine, glutamine, asparagine, histidine, alanine, ornithine, L
leucine, 2-phenylalanine, glutamic acid, threonine, etc., organic sugars or sugar
alcohols, such as lactose, trehalose, stachyose, mannitol, sorbitol, xylitol, ribitol,
myoinisitol, galactitol, glycerol and the like, including cyclitols such as inositol;
polyethylene glycol; amino acid polymers; sulfur containing reducing agents, such as
urea, glutathione, thioctic acid, sodium thioglycolate, thioglycerol, .alpha.
monothioglycerol and sodium thio sulfate; low molecular weight polypeptides (i.e.
<10 residues); proteins such as human serum albumin, bovine serum albumin,
gelatin or immunoglobulins; hydrophylic polymers, such as polyvinylpyrrolidone
monosaccharides, such as xylose, mannose, fructose, glucose; disaccharides such
as lactose, maltose, sucrose and trisaccacharides such as raffinose;
polysaccharides such as dextran. Stabilizers may be present in the range from 0.1
to 10,000 weights per part of weight active protein.
[00090]                     Non-ionic surfactants or detergents (also known as "wetting agents")
may be added to help solubilize the therapeutic agent as well as to protect the
therapeutic protein against agitation-induced aggregation, which also permits the
formulation to be exposed to shear surface stressed without causing denaturation of
the protein. Suitable non-ionic surfactants include polysorbates (20, 80, etc.),
polyoxamers (184, 188 etc.), Pluronic.RTM. polyols, polyoxyethylene sorbitan
monoethers (Tween.RTM.-20, Tween.RTM.-80, etc.). Non-ionic surfactants may be
present in a range of about 0.05 mg/ml to about 1.0 mg/ml, preferably about 0.07
mg/ml to about 0.2 mg/ml.
[00091]                    Additional miscellaneous excipients include bulking agents, (e.g.
starch), chelating agents (e.g. EDTA), antioxidants (e.g., ascorbic acid, methionine,
vitamin E), and cosolvents. The formulation herein may also contain more than one
                                                          32

active compound as necessary for the particular indication being treated, preferably
those with complementary activities that do not adversely affect each other. For
example, it may be desireable to further provide an immunosuppressive agent.
Such molecules are suitably present in combination in amounts that are effective for
the purpose intended. The active ingredients may also be entrapped in
microcapsule prepared, for example, by coascervation techniques or by interfacial
polymerization, for example, hydroxymethylcellulose or gelatin-microcapsule and
poly-(methylmethacylate) microcapsule, respectively, in colloidal drug delivery
systems (for example, liposomes, albumin micropheres, microemulsions, nano
particles and nanocapsules) or in macroemulsions. Such techniques are disclosed
in Remington 's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 16th edition, A. Osal, Ed. (1980).
[00092]                    The formulations to be used for in vivo administration must be sterile.
This is readily accomplished, for example, by filtration through sterile filtration
membranes. Sustained-release preparations may be prepared. Suitable examples
of sustained-release preparations include semi-permeable matrices of solid
hydrophobic polymers containing the antibody variant, which matrices are in the form
of shaped articles, e.g., films, or microcapsules. Examples of sustained-release
matrices include polyesters, hydrogels (for example, poly(2-hydroxyethyl
methacrylate), or poly(vinylalcohol)), polylactides (U.S. Pat. No. 3,773,919),
copolymers of L-glutamic acid and ethyl-L-glutamate, non-degradable ethylene-vinyl
acetate, degradable lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymers such as the LUPRON
DEPOT T M (injectable microspheres composed of lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymer
and leuprolide acetate), and poly-D- (-)-3-hydroxybutyric acid. While polymers such
as ethylene-vinyl acetate and lactic acid-glycolic acid enable release of molecules for
over 100 days, certain hydrogels release proteins for shorter time periods. When
encapsulated antibodies remain in the body for a long time, they may denature or
aggregate as a result of exposure to moisture at 370 C resulting in a loss of
biological activity and possible changes in immunogenicity. Rational strategies can
be devised for stabilization depending on the mechanism involved. For example, if
the aggregation mechanism is discovered to be intermolecular S--S bond formation
through thio-disulfide interchange, stabilization may be achieved by modifying
sulfhydryl residues, lyophilizing from acidic solutions, controlling moisture content,
using appropriate additives, and developing specific polymer matrix compositions.

[00093]                    The amount of therapeutic polypeptide, antibody or fragment thereof
which will be effective in the treatment of a particular disorder or condition will
depend on the nature of the disorder or condition, and can be determined by
standard clinical techniques. Where possible, it is desirable to determine the dose
response curve and the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention first in vitro,
and then in useful animal model systems prior to testing in humans.
[00094]                     In a preferred embodiment, an aqueous solution of therapeutic
polypeptide, antibody or fragment thereof is administered by subcutaneous injection.
Each dose may range from about 0.5 W to about 50 W per kilogram of body weight,
or more preferably, from about 3 W to about 30 W p er kilogram body weight.
[00095]                    The dosing schedule for subcutaneous administration may vary form
once a month to daily depending on a number of clinical factors, including the type of
disease, severity of disease, and the subject's sensitivity to the therapeutic agent.
USES FOR THE HUMANIZED ANTIBODY
[00096]                    The humanized antibodies of the present invention are useful in
diagnostic assays, e.g., for detecting expression of a target of interest in specific
cells, tissues, or serum. For diagnostic applications, the antibody variant typically
will be labeled with a detectable moiety. Numerous labels are available.
Techniques for quantifying a change in fluorescence are described above. The
chemiluminescent substrate becomes electronically excited by a chemical reaction
and may then emit light which can be measured (using a chemiluminometer, for
example) or donates energy to a fluorescent acceptor. Examples of enzymatic labels
include luciferases (e.g., firefly luciferase and bacterial luciferase; U.S. Pat. No.
4,737,456), luciferin, 2,3-dihydrophthalazinediones, malate dehydrogenase, urease,
peroxidase such as horseradish peroxidase (HRPO), alkaline phosphatase, .beta.
galactosidase, glucoamylase, lysozyme, saccharide oxidases (e.g., glucose oxidase,
galactose oxidase, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase), heterocyclic oxidases
(such as uricase and xanthine oxidase), lactoperoxidase, microperoxidase, and the
like. Techniques for conjugating enzymes to antibodies are described in O'Sullivan
et al., Methods for the Preparation of Enzyme-Antibody Conjugates for Use in
Enzyme Immunoassay, in Methods in Enzym. (Ed. J. Langone & H. Van Vunakis),
Academic press, New York, 73: 147-166 (1981).

[00097]                     Sometimes, the label is indirectly conjugated with the antibody variant.
The skilled artisan will be aware of various techniques for achieving this. For
example, the antibody variant can be conjugated with biotin and any of the three
broad categories of labels mentioned above can be conjugated with avidin, or vice
versa. Biotin binds selectively to avidin and thus, the label can be conjugated with
the antibody variant in this indirect manner. Alternatively, to achieve indirect
conjugation of the label with the antibody variant, the antibody variant is conjugated
with a small hapten (e.g. digloxin) and one of the different types of labels mentioned
above is conjugated with an anti-hapten antibody variant (e.g. anti-digloxin antibody).
Thus, indirect conjugation of the label with the antibody variant can be achieved.
[00098]                     In another embodiment of the invention, the antibody variant need not
be labeled, and the presence thereof can be detected using a labeled antibody
which binds to the antibody variant.
[00099]                    The antibodies of the present invention may be employed in any known
assay method, such as competitive binding assays, direct and indirect sandwich
assays, and immunoprecipitation assays. Zola, Monoclonal Antibodies: A Manual of
Techniques, pp. 147-158 (CRC Press, Inc. 1987).
[000100]                    Competitive binding assays rely on the ability of a labeled standard to
compete with the test sample for binding with a limited amount of antibody variant.
The amount of target in the test sample is inversely proportional to the amount of
standard that becomes bound to the antibodies. To facilitate determining the
amount of standard that becomes bound, the antibodies generally are insolubilized
before or after the competition. As a result, the standard and test sample that are
bound to the antibodies may conveniently be separated from the standard and test
sample which remain unbound.
[000101]                    Sandwich assays involve the use of two antibodies, each capable of
binding to a different immunogenic portion, or epitope, or the protein to be detected.
In a sandwich assay, the test sample to be analyzed is bound by a first antibody
which is immobilized on a solid support, and thereafter a second antibody binds to
the test sample, thus forming an insoluble three-part complex. See e.g., U.S. Pat.
No. 4,376,110. The second antibody may itself be labeled with a detectable moiety
(direct sandwich assays) or may be measured using an anti-immunoglobulin
antibody that is labeled with a detectable moiety (indirect sandwich assay). For
                                                        35
10119248_1 (GHMatters) P80942.AU.3

example, one type of sandwich assay is an ELISA assay, in which case the
detectable moiety is an enzyme.
[000102]                    For immunohistochemistry, the tumor sample may be fresh or frozen or
may be embedded in paraffin and fixed with a preservative such as formalin, for
example.
[000103]                   The antibodies may also be used for in vivo diagnostic assays.
Generally, the antibody variant is labeled with a radionucleotide (such as .sup.1 11
In, .sup.99 Tc, .sup.14 C, .sup.131 1, .sup.3 H, .sup.32 P or .sup.35 S) so that the
tumor can be localized using immunoscintiography. For example, a high affinity anti
IgE antibody of the present invention may be used to detect the amount of IgE
present in, e.g., the lungs of an asthmatic patient.
[000104]                   The antibody of the present invention can be provided in a kit, i.e.,
packaged combination of reagents in predetermined amounts with instructions for
performing the diagnostic assay. Where the antibody variant is labeled with an
enzyme, the kit may include substrates and cofactors required by the enzyme (e.g.,
a substrate precursor which provides the detectable chromophore or fluorophore).
In addition, other additives may be included such as stabilizers, buffers (e.g., a block
buffer or lysis buffer) and the like. The relative amounts of the various reagents may
be varied widely to provide for concentrations in solution of the reagents which
substantially optimize the sensitivity of the assay. Particularly, the reagents may be
provided as dry powders, usually lyophilized, including excipients which on
dissolution will provide a reagent solution having the appropriate concentration.
IN VIVO USES FOR THE ANTIBODY
[000105]                    It is contemplated that the antibodies of the present invention may be
used to treat a mammal. In one embodiment, the antibody is administered to a
nonhuman mammal for the purposes of obtaining preclinical data, for example.
Exemplary nonhuman mammals to be treated include nonhuman primates, dogs,
cats, rodents and other mammals in which preclinical studies are performed. Such
mammals may be established animal models for a disease to be treated with the
antibody or may be used to study toxicity of the antibody of interest. In each of these
embodiments, dose escalation studies may be performed on the mammal.
[000106]                   The antibody or polypeptide is administered by any suitable means,
including parenteral, subcutaneous, intraperitoneal, intrapulmonary, and intranasal,
                                                         36
10119248_1 (GHMatters) P80942.AU.3

and, if desired for local immunosuppressive treatment, intralesional administration.
Parenteral infusions include intramuscular, intravenous, intraarterial, intraperitoneal,
or subcutaneous administration. In addition, the antibody variant is suitably
administered by pulse infusion, particularly with declining doses of the antibody
variant. Preferably the dosing is given by injections, most preferably intravenous or
subcutaneous injections, depending in part on whether the administration is brief or
chronic.
[000107]                    For the prevention or treatment of disease, the appropriate dosage of
the antibody or polypeptide will depend on the type of disease to be treated, the
severity and course of the disease, whether the antibody variant is administered for
preventive or therapeutic purposes, previous therapy, the patient's clinical history
and response to the antibody, and the discretion of the attending physician.
[000108]                    Depending on the type and severity of the disease, about 0.1 mg/kg to
150 mg/kg (e.g., 0.1-20 mg/kg) of antibody is an initial candidate dosage for
administration to the patient, whether, for example, by one or more separate
administrations, or by continuous infusion. A typical daily dosage might range from
about 1 mg/kg to 100 mg/kg or more, depending on the factors mentioned above.
For repeated administrations over several days or longer, depending on the
condition, the treatment is sustained until a desired suppression of disease
symptoms occurs. However, other dosage regimens may be useful. The progress
of this therapy is easily monitored by conventional techniques and assays. An
exemplary dosing regimen is disclosed in WO 94/04188.
[000109]                   The antibody compositions may be formulated, dosed and
administered in a manner consistent with good medical practice. Factors for
consideration in this context include the particular disorder being treated, the
particular mammal being treated, the clinical condition of the individual patient, the
cause of the disorder, the site of delivery of the agent, the method of administration,
the scheduling of administration, and other factors known to medical practitioners.
The "therapeutically effective amount" of the antibody to be administered will be
governed by such considerations, and is the minimum amount necessary to prevent,
ameliorate, or treat a disease or disorder. The antibody need not be, but is
optionally formulated with one or more agents currently used to prevent or treat the
disorder in question. The effective amount of such other agents depends on the
                                                        37
10119248_1 (GHMatters) P80942.AU.3

amount of antibody present in the formulation, the type of disorder or treatment, and
other factors discussed above. These are generally used in the same dosages and
with administration routes as used hereinbefore or about from 1 to 99% of the
heretofore employed dosages.
[000110]                   The antibodies of the present invention which recognize Factor D as
their target may be used to treat complement-mediated disorders. These disorders
are associated with excessive or uncontrolled complement activation. They include:
Complement activation during cardiopulmonary bypass operations; complement
activation due to ischemia-reperfusion following acute myocardial infarction,
aneurysm, stroke, hemorrhagic shock, crush injury, multiple organ failure,
hypobolemic shock and intestinal ischemia. These disorders can also include
disease or condition is an inflammatory condition such as severe burns,
endotoxemia, septic shock, adult respiratory distress syndrome, hemodialysis;
anaphylactic shock, severe asthma, angioedema, Crohn's disease, sickle cell
anemia, poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis and pancreatitis. The disorder may be
the result of an adverse drug reaction, drug allergy, IL-2 induced vascular leakage
syndrome or radiographic contrast media allergy. It also includes autoimmune
disease such as systemic lupus erythematosus, myasthenia gravis, rheumatoid
arthritis, Alzheimer's disease and multiple sclerosis. Complement activation is also
associated with transplant rejection. Recently there has been a strong correlation
shown between complement activation and ocular diseases such as age-related
macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy.

EXAMPLES
[000111]                   The following examples are offered by way of illustration and not by
way of limitation.
Example 1: Humanization of Factor D Murine MAb 166-32
[000112]                   The sequences of the heavy chain variable region (VH) and the light
chain variable region (VL) of murine mAb 166-32 were compared with human
antibody germline sequences available in the public databases. Several criteria
were used when deciding on a template as described in step 1 above, including
overall length, similar CDR position within the framework, overall homology, size of
the CDR, etc. All of these criteria taken together provided a result for choosing the
optimal human template as shown in the sequence alignment between 166-32 MAb
heavy and light chain sequences and the respective human template sequences
depicted in Figures 3 and 4.
[000113]                    In this case, more than one human framework template was used to
design this antibody. The human template chosen for the VH chain was a
combination of VI-4.1 b+ (7-04.1 locus)(access# X621 10)(VH7 family) and JH4d
(See Figure 3). The human template chosen for the VL chain was a combination of
DPK4 (VK I family) combined with JK2 (See Figure 4).
[000114]                    Once the template was chosen, a Fab library was constructed by DNA
synthesis and overlapping PCR. The library was composed of synthesized MAb
166-32 CDRs synthesized with the respective chosen human templates. The
overlapping nucleotides encoding partial VH and VL sequences were synthesized in
the range of about 63 to about 76 nucleotides with 18 to 21 nucleotide overlaps.
Vectors expressing a library of humanized Fabs against Factor D antigen were
constructed, and transformed into E. coli DH1OB then plated on XL-1B bacterial
lawn.
[000115]                    Library quality was evaluated for the size (the number of independent
clones) and the diversity (the distribution of the mutations). The individual clones
with double insertion of both light and heavy chain was about 14 out of 20
sequenced. Framework wobble mutations were evenly distributed.
[000116]                    PCR amplification of VL and VH gene was performed using a
biotinylated forward primer containing the specific sequence to the framework region
FR1 and an overhanging sequence annealed to the end of leader sequence
                                                        39

(Genelli) and a reverse primer from the conserved constant region (Clor CH1)
under standard PCR conditions. The PCR product was purified by agarose gel
electrophoresis, or by commercial PCR purification kit to remove unincorporated
biotinylated primers and non-specific PCR.
EXAMPLE 2: Library Screening
[000117]                    Capture Filter Lift was used for primary screening. The actual
screening sized is more than 3 times larger than the theoretic library size. The
candidates were further screened by single-point ELISA assay. The best binders
were further confirmed by direct antigen titration using Factor D based on Fab
concentration
[000118]                    Capture lift screening
[000119]                    Capture Filter Lift Assay was used for primary screening for the binding
of Fab to Factor D. High titer phage were plated and incubated at 37 0 C till use (about
6-8 hr). Goat anti-human kappa was diluted to 10ug/ml in 10 ml PBST;
Nitrocellulose filters for lifting plaques were prepared according to standard plaque
lifting procedures and then immersed in1Oml blocking buffer for 2 hrs on a shaker.
The filters were rinsed 3x with PBST. The filters were applied to a plaque lawn and
incubated at RT for approximately 15-24 hours. The filters were then removed from
the plates and rinsed with TBST 3x.
[000120]                    Factor D (50ug/ml) was diluted in PBST to 0.1ug/ml and 4ml per filter
was added. The filters were incubated in the solution for 2hr on a shaker at RT
followed by rinsing 3x, each time 5min. Diluted 166-222-HRP (1:10, 000 with PBST)
was added at a volume of 4 ml per filter and the filters were incubated for 1hr on a
shaker. The filters were rinsed 4x. The filters were dried and then immersed in TMB
substrate followed by immersion in water to stop the reaction. Positive clones were
identified.

EXAMPLE 3: Single-Point ELISA screening
[000121]                    Single-Point ELISA assay was used for the secondary screening.
Immulon II plates were coated with goat anti-human Fab (1:12,000, 50ul/well) over
night at RT. The next day the plates were washed 4x with a plate washer. Blocking
buffer was added at a volume of1 00ul per well and plates incubated for 1hr at RT.
The plates were then washed 4x.
[000122]                    Each Fab to be screened was added at a volume of 50ul per well
(either from 15ml periplasmic preparation or supernatant) and incubated 1 hr at RT.
Plates were washed 4x followed by the addition of 50ul/well biotinylated factor D at
0.01ug/ml. Plates were incubated for 1hr at RT and then washed 4x. StreptAvidin
HRP was added (1:10,000 in PBST) and incubated for 1hr at RT. Plates were
washed 5x and then developed by adding TMB substrate at 50ul/well. Stop buffer
was added at a volume of 50ul when it is well-developed (10-45 min) and the plates
were read at 450nm.
Example 4: Sequencing of Humanized anti-Factor D clones
[000123]                    Sixteen humanized clones with good binding affinity for human Factor
D were sequenced (see Table 1). Among these, position 2 (100% human) and 49
(100% mouse) in the light chain, and position 93 (100% mouse) in the heavy chain
are highly conserved indicating that they are important in maintaining antibody
binding ability.

D as chimeric 166-32 Fab (see Table 4). Hemolytic inhibition assay showed that
clone #56 is somewhat more potent than chimeric 166-32 Fab (see Figure 6). Clone
# 56 contains two murine residues in the framework of light chain and four murine
residues in the heavy chain. (see Table 1). Based on these results, further
optimization was carried out.

contains the conserved murine residue in the heavy chain position 97 as found in
clone #56. There is one beneficial mutation in both light and heavy chain CDR3 in
clone #111.                From two independent libraries screened (humanization library, and
humanization/CDR3s optimization library), we found that the best clones have
similar consensus residues.
[000126]                   To further optimize the affinity of clone #111, an antibody library was
constructed by introducing single mutations into the CDR-H1 and CDR-L2
simultaneously. In brief, site-directed mutagenesis approach was used to construct
such libraries by annealing oligonucleotides encoding single mutations to the
template of clone #111.                 A total of 24 clones with very high affinity to human Factor
D were sequenced. Among those 24 clones, several redundant beneficial mutations
were identified. Clones #250, #315, #345 and #416 were selected for BlAcore
analysis (see Table 4). BlAcore data showed that these clones have higher affinity
to human Factor D than initial clone #111.                 Clone #250, #315, #348 and #416 were
also tested in the hemolytic inhibition assay (see Figure 6) and inhibition of the
alternative pathway (Figure 7).
Example 5: AP Hemolysis Assay
[000127]                    Biological function of the humanized clones was determined using
hemolytic inhibition assay and BlAcore analysis (See Example 6 below). Hemolytic
assay was performed according to the following procedure. 20 ul of 1:20 diluted
rabbit red blood cells (RRBC) (0.5 ml + 9.5 ml GVB/Mg-EGTA buffer) in 20 ml Saline
(0.9% NaCI) at approximately 1 : 2x10 4 dilution were counted by Coulter Counter.

received about 500x10 6 / plate RRBC or about 1 ml RRBC/plate (500x10 6 /2-5                      x10 4
[000128]                    Cells were diluted in 6 ml GVB/Mg-EGTA buffer/plate, mixed and
washed 3 times by spinning at 1360 rpm x 4 min at 4 cC. The RRBC pellet is
suspended in 3 ml GVB/Mg-EGTA buffer /plate and kept on ice.
[000129]                    Human serum from -80'C freezer was thawed just prior to use. The

Example 6: Kinetic Analysis of anti-Human Factor D Fab by BiaCore
[000131]                    Immobilization- Human factor D (Advanced Research Inc, 0.1 mg/ml)
was directly immobilized onto the CM5 chip (BiaCore) using amine-coupling method.
The procedure is briefly described as following: (1) Constant flow (PBS) is at 5
pl/min. (2) Injection of 35 pl EDC/NHS (1:1). (3) Injection of 35 pl of human factor D
in acetate buffer, pH 4.5. (4) Block the activated group by injection of 35 pl
etholamine. (5) Clean-up the surface by 5 pl 10 mM Glycine pH 1.5. The ligand
(human factor D) immobilization level is about 1,000 RU. Test run using a-human
factor D (huDi, 40 pl, 31.5 pg/ml) yielded a relative response around 900 RU.
[000132]                    Kinetic analysis- All anti-human factor D Fabs were diluted in PBS
buffer. Each sample was prepared in a series of concentrations: 12.5 nM, 25 nM, 50
nM, 75nM, 100 nM, 125 nM, and 150 nM, with 40 pl injection pulse at high
acquisition rate. Regeneration was accomplished by applying 5 pl pulse of 10 mM
Glycine at pH 1.5. Kinetic parameters were obtained by fitting Fabs binding traces to
1:1 binding model under pseudo-first order kinetic using BlAvaluation version 3.0.
The results are presented in Table 2 below. All data are obtained by global fitting
