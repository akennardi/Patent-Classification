                              Steel tower for a wind turbine and a method for producing the tower
   The invention relates to a steel tower for a wind turbine, comprising a plurality of tower sections
   arranged one above another and joined together, of which at least one tower section consists of
 5 section segments joined together. The invention likewise relates to a method for making such a steel
   tower.
   With the increasing demand for wind turbines of higher power and thus larger dimensions of the
   main components, such as tower, nacelle, and rotor blades, the permissible limits for vehicle
10 dimensions have been reached, especially the maximum height of around 4 meters. The boundaries
   dictated by the logistical infrastructure, such as clear height under bridges, also make it necessary to
   divide tower sections with more than roughly 4 meters diameter into several pieces.
   The utility model DE 203 21 855 Ul describes a steel tower for a wind turbine comprising a
15 number of cylindrical or conical tower sections, where at least its broader sections are subdivided
   into two or more elongated shell segments which are combined into a complete tower section by
   means of vertical flanges, which are fastened to each other by a plurality of bolts, the shells also
   being provided with upper and lower horizontal flanges in order to allow the tower sections to be
   connected to each other.
20
   Patent application DE 10 2007 018 025 Al shows a wind turbine tower with a load-bearing outer
   tower wall, having an encircling outer boundary surface and consisting of a plurality of wall
   sections, each of which has a middle section and two edge sections running in the longitudinal
   direction of the tower, being provided with a plurality of connection boreholes, while the surfaces
25 defined by the edge sections run along the outer boundary surface or at a constant distance from it,
   and the connection boreholes are oriented transversely to the outer boundary surface.
   From DE 10 2010 039 796 Al there is known a tower with an adapter piece as well as a method of
   making a tower, wherein a lower tubular tower section of concrete and an upper tubular tower
30 section of steel are provided. Such hybrid towers are preferred at present for the erecting of
   especially tall wind turbine towers, since large diameters are possible with the lower concrete
   9821297_1(GHMattes) P107483.AU

   structure and conventional steel tubular tower sections can be set atop the lower tower structure in
   order to achieve greater heights and thus better wind utilization.
   From WO 2015/161858 Al there is known a method for making a tower section for the tower of a
 5 wind turbine in which the tower section is subdivided into section segments in the tower lengthwise
   direction. The section segments are at first created by severing the tower wall and afterwards joined
   to each other once more with the aid of flanges.
   One problem which the invention proposes to solve is to provide a steel tower for a wind turbine as
10 well as a method for making it, making it possible to produce precisely a tower section connected
   from segmented tower sections with simple means.
   The problem is solved by a steel tower as claimed in claim 1 or claim 3 and likewise by a method
   for its production as claimed in claim 13. Advantageous embodiments are the subject matter of the
15 dependent claims.
   The steel tower according to the invention, especially a tubular steel tower for a wind turbine,
   comprises a plurality of cylindrical and/or conical tower sections which are joined together
   preferably by means of horizontal annular flanges and/or annular flange segments. At least one
20 tower section is divided into several, preferably three section segments, which are joined together
   each by means of longitudinal profiles having a plurality of through holes and by connection means
   to form a complete tower section. The vertically attached longitudinal profiles have at least two
   preferably plane parallel legs as well as a web connecting the legs. The monolithic longitudinal
   profile is welded on either side to the inside of the wall of the tower section. The monolithic
25 longitudinal profile is severed together with the tower wall in the longitudinal direction, preferably
   down the middle, wherein the web of the monolithic longitudinal profile is also divided. The web
   sections formed by the severing of the longitudinal profile preferably have separation sections on
   their mutually facing sides, which were formed by the severing. However, the tower sections
   according to the invention are not limited to two or three section segments, but instead also
30 encompass tower sections having four or more section segments.

                                                    -3
   The steel tower of the invention as claimed in claim 3 agrees largely in its features with the steel
   tower as claimed in claim 1. One difference lies in the configuration of the longitudinal profile after
   the severing. According to claim 3, the severed longitudinal profile does not have two mutually
   facing web sections, but instead separation sections on the mutually facing sides of the legs. The
 5 longitudinal profiles in both embodiments of the invention have two legs before and after the
   severing.
   According to the invention, the problem is solved in that a method is provided for the making of a
   tubular steel tower for a wind turbine, in which tower wall and longitudinal profile are severed
10 together during a separation process along a segment boundary.
   In one advantageous embodiment of the invention, the tower section has at least two section pieces,
   which are welded together along their adjacent horizontal annular end faces and are welded to
   horizontal annular flanges along the free uppermost and lowermost end face, the annular flanges
15 being divisible at predetermined positions into at least two, preferably three or more annular flange
   segments. The annular flanges possess a plurality of through holes for connection means, such as
   screws, threaded bolts and threaded rods.
   Each section segment of a tower section has at least one annular flange segment at its upper and
20 lower end face. The arc length of the lower annular flange segment is greater than or less than or the
   same as the arc length of the upper annular flange segment, and the annular flange segments possess
   a plurality of through holes for connection means such as threaded bolts or the like.
   In one advantageous embodiment of the invention, the monolithic longitudinal profiles are
25 preferably fashioned as equilateral U-profiles, H-profiles, C-profiles, I-profiles, cap profiles or
   double-T profiles. The use of double-leg profiles with a joining web offers considerable advantages
   over two flat iron pieces welded together, since on the whole fewer individual parts need to be
   manipulated. The longitudinal profile already has plane parallel legs, which is also preserved in the
   severing process.
30
   In one advantageous embodiment of the longitudinal profile, its webs each have a U or V-shaped
   fillet at the tower wall side, extending in the longitudinal direction. This fillet performs two
   9821297_1(GHMattes) P107483.AU

                                                     -4
   functions, in particular: On the one hand, there is achieved an advantageous cross section and thus
   material reduction for a subsequent lengthwise cutting, and on the other hand a fillet is created on
   either side of the separation line for a welded seam for the sealing of any gap created after a
   lengthwise cutting. The web sections remaining on either side of the fillet form secure bearing
 5 surfaces, especially surfaces free of tilting, for the inner side of the tower wall. For further
   improvement of the welding process, the vertically arranged longitudinal profiles each time have a
   bevel in the longitudinal direction at the outwardly facing transitions from the legs to the right
   angled web for making a welded seam.
10 A preferred connection of a longitudinal profile of a first kind, especially one in the form of a U, C,
   or cap profile, to the tubular wall of the tower section is accomplished in that, for example, the
   longitudinal profile is welded on with its web facing the inside of the wall of a tower section. In the
   case of a C profile open toward the top, whose two inwardly curved right-angled prolongations of
   the legs are facing each other and whose spacing basically corresponds to the width of the slot in the
15 web, one has the further advantage that no spacing elements are needed during a later installation of
   the section segments, since the mentioned prolongations are drawn toward each other and thus
   perform the function of the spacing elements, thereby producing an advantageous reduction in the
   installation time at the construction site.
20 A preferred arrangement for the connecting of a second kind of longitudinal profile, especially in
   the form of H, I, or double T profiles, but also U, C, or cap profiles, to the tubular wall of the tower
   section, is accomplished in that the longitudinal profiles are welded on with their web facing the
   inside of the wall of a tower section. When using a H profile open toward the top according to the
   invention, in which the web is at a distance from the inside of the wall of a tower section, the width
25 of the slot in the web can advantageously be chosen such that no spacing elements are needed
   during a later installation of the section segments, since the end faces of the web are drawn toward
   each other and thus perform the function of the spacing elements, thereby producing an
   advantageous reduction in the installation time at the construction site.
30 It has been found to be advantageous for the length of the parallel and spaced apart longitudinal
   profiles of a section piece to be greater than the length of the section piece itself, because then the
   horizontal welded seams of the connection of the section pieces can be bridged over.

   The tubular steel tower according to the invention affords time savings and economic savings for
   present and future towers with a large diameter, and in particular wind turbines with the tubular
   steel towers according to the invention are available more quickly for energy production. One time
 5 saving aspect in the use of section segments is that these can advisedly be provided with built-in
   elements in the form of components for an access system, conductor sections, cable holding
   devices, busbars and/or other built-in elements running in the longitudinal direction of the tower or
   the section segments, before the section segments are transported to the installation site. A further
   benefit of the section segments is that these can be more easily surface coated and/or varnished,
10 especially with smaller coating installations, before being transported to the installation site.
   In one advantageous way of carrying out the method, for a further machining the tower section is
   placed by means of a hoist or an industrial truck above at least one movable cutting device and set
   down on supporting means of a lifting device such that the first planned axial separation line is in a
15 6 o'clock position, i.e., facing downward. According to the 6 and 12 o'clock positions on a watch
   dial, the 6 o'clock position denotes the lowest and the 12 o'clock position the highest position. The
   tubular body not yet completed with the annular flanges to form the tower section can also be
   machined accordingly.
20 Furthermore, the method preferably involves welding a closed annular flange in a predetermined
   position with regard to the circumferential direction onto the ring shaped end faces of the tubular
   body or a section piece in order to form a tower section, the annular flanges having partial sections
   with a reduced cross section in predetermined positions and the partial sections coinciding with the
   planned separation lines or being flush with them. After the severing, the separation lines form the
25 segment boundaries and the annular flange consists of annular flange segments.
   In one especially preferred procedure of the method, in the following step the annular flanges of the
   tower section are connected, in particular bolted, at the end face to movable or moving devices, the
   devices being preferably designed as rotatable receiving wheels or rotatable frames. By means of
30 these devices, a tower section can be rotated in an especially gentle manner, i.e., without leaving
   marks by rollers on the outer sheath of the tubular body, such as might occur with the use of roller
   beds.

                                                      -6
   In another especially preferred procedure of the method, with a further step the tower section or the
   tubular body is placed by means of a hoist or an industrial truck onto two or more beams running
   parallel to each other, the tower section being positioned such that the first planned axial separation
 5 line runs substantially down the middle between the parallel beams in the 6 o'clock position. The
   beams belong to a supporting device, on which the tower section lies and which prevents a buckling
   of the tower section.
   With another preferred following step of the method according to the invention, the at least one
10 movable cutting device is moved into a starting position near a first annular flange and then in a
   further step the cutting tool, especially a side milling cutter or a saw blade, under rotation, is
   brought into contact by means of a vertically movable tool holder with the first annular flange at the
   first predetermined position.
15 In one especially preferred procedure of the method, with the following step the first annular flange
   is severed by means of the cutting tool at the first predetermined position with reduced cross section
   and in an immediately following step the cutting tool is moved continuously along the first axial
   separation line through the tubular wall as well as the web of the longitudinal profile connected to
   the tubular wall. Preferably, the direction of rotation of the cutting tool is chosen such that the
20 resulting shavings are taken away downward. The cutting tool is further moved continuously along
   the first axial separation line through the tubular wall as well as the web of the longitudinal profile
   connected to it and finally through the second annular flange. After this, the cutting tool is moved
   back to its starting position. With the method according to the invention it is possible to
   automatically perform the cutting process over the entire length of the tower section, especially
25 without a manual repositioning of a cutting device.
   After completing the first lengthwise cut through the tower section, the method preferably involves
   steps for making additional lengthwise cuts, at first performing a rotation of the tower section about
   its longitudinal axis, e.g., by 120', preferably by means of the rotatable receiving wheels, so that the
30 second planned axial separation line is positioned at the 6 o'clock position.

                                                             -7
   After this, with the following steps additional lengthwise cuts are made with the cutting tool.
   Specifically, the steps for this involve: severing the first annular flange at the second predetermined
   partial section. Immediately after this, the cutting tool is moved continuously along the second axial
   separation line through the tubular wall and the web of the longitudinal profile. Finally, the second
 5 annular flange is severed at the second predetermined partial section.
   Then there occurs a further rotation of the tower section about its longitudinal axis, preferably by
   means of the rotatable receiving wheels, e.g., by a further 120', until the first section segment which
   has been cut free is positioned substantially in the middle in the 12 o'clock position. Then comes
10 the connecting of the section segment to the slings of a hoist, the moving of the section segment by
   means of the hoist and/or the positioning means of the receiving wheels on the outside radially, the
   releasing of the section segment from the receiving wheels, the lifting of the section segment and
   setting it down on a transportation trailer by means of the hoist, the hauling away of the section
   segment, preferably to a following processing installation, especially a coating and/or varnishing
15 installation.

   Fig. 1 shows a wind turbine 1 with a tower, which is constructed as a tubular steel tower 2 from a
   number of equal and different tower sections 7, 8, 9, wherein the lowermost tower section 7 is
   shown in detail in Fig. 2. The tubular steel tower 2 carries a nacelle 4 which is mounted so as to be
20 able to rotate about a vertical longitudinal axis of the tower. In the nacelle 4 is mounted a drive train
   (not shown) with a main shaft, a gearing, and a generator. The main shaft stands in operative
   connection with a rotor hub 5, on which three rotor blades 6 are mounted so as to be able to rotate
   about their longitudinal axis. The tubular steel tower 2 besides the lowermost tower section 7
   comprises further tower sections 8, 9, where the lower tower sections 7, 8, i.e., those with larger
25 diameter, consist of detachably joined section segments 18, while the upper tower sections 9, i.e.,
   those with smaller diameter, are configured as monolithic sections in the circumferential direction.
   Fig. 2 shows the lower tower section 7 with the tower entrance door opening 10. The prefabricated
   tower section 7 comprises a number of section pieces 28, also known as "rounds" or "cans" among
30 experts. The section pieces 28 generally have a lengthwise welded seam due to the manufacturing
   process. Other tower sections 8, without tower entrance door opening 10, are constructed
   accordingly, the number of section pieces 28 possibly varying. In the sample embodiment shown,
   9821297_1(GHMattes) P107483.AU

                                                      -9
   the tower section 7 has in total nine section pieces 28, which are welded to each other at their end
   faces. The free end faces of the outermost section pieces 28 of a section are each welded to an
   annular flange 12. In an advantageous modification, not shown, the annular flanges 12 are each
   welded beforehand to a perpendicularly disposed section piece 28 before being welded to the other
 5 section pieces 28. It is known to weld individual annular flange segments, instead of closed annular
   flanges, to the free end faces of the outermost section pieces of a tower section, although this
   requires an additional effort for the orientation work.
   As can furthermore be noticed in Figure 2, the individual section pieces 28 can be rotated relative to
10 each other about their lengthwise axis such that their longitudinal welded seams are always offset
   from each other by an offset angle so that the longitudinal welded seams of neighboring section
   pieces 28 do not lie flush in the same line. The sum of the offset angles is preferably 360' or a
   whole multiple thereof. Fig. 2 moreover shows a first longitudinal profile 13 roughly in the 5
   o'clock position, which extends on the inside of the wall of the tower section 7 parallel to its center
15 axis and is welded to the wall. Besides the longitudinal profile 13 shown, the tower section 7 has
   two more longitudinal profiles 13, not visible from the outside, arranged each at a 120' offset in the
   tubular wall. In a following fabrication step, the tower section 7 is divided along a first, second and
   third planned separation line 19 into three section segments 18, the planned separation lines 19 each
   coinciding with the longitudinal profiles 13. In other words, the respective lengthwise cutting
20 occurs through the longitudinal profile 13, so that the section segments can afterwards be joined
   together once more by the longitudinal profile.
   Fig. 3a, 3b, 3c show one possible longitudinal profile 13 in the form of a U profile 33, having
   equally long, plane parallel legs 33a, 33b and a web 33c joining the legs together, in three
25 consecutive fabrication steps. The U profile 33 at first is welded by its web 33c on either side by the
   welded seams 34a and 34b to the as yet undivided tubular wall 38, only a cutout of the tubular wall
   38 being shown. The web 33c furthermore has on the side facing the tubular wall 38 a fillet 35,
   which has two purposes: first of all, an advantageous cross section and thus material reduction is
   achieved for a following lengthwise cutting, wherein a first slot 36 is created in the tubular wall 38
30 of the tower section 7, 8 and a second slot 32 in the web 33c of the U profile 33, cf. Fig. 3b. The
   slots 36 and 32 are preferably produced in a common separation process. Each of the slots 32, 36
   after the severing has a pair of mutually facing separation sections in which the separation occurred.

                                                     - 10
   Secondly, a fillet is created on either side of the slot edge for a further welded seam 34c, 34d on
   each side. In the course of the installation at the construction site, the section segments 18 are
   finally connected securely by means of connection means 39, especially consisting of threaded bolts
   39a, which are passed through through holes 31 in the legs 33a, 33b of the severed longitudinal
 5 profile, and nuts 39c. Spacing elements 37 ensure a predetermined spacing and the slot widths 32,
   36, as shown by Fig. 3c. Thus, a desired slot width 32, 36 can be advantageously adjusted with the
   length of the spacing elements 37.
   Fig. 4a, 4b, 4c show another arrangement of longitudinal profile 13 and tubular wall 38. The
10 longitudinal profile 13 here is fashioned in the form of a H profile 43, having equally long and
   plane parallel legs 43a, 43b and a web 43c. The H profile 43 is at first welded by its legs 43a, 43b
   on either side by the welded seams 44a and 44b to the as yet undivided tubular wall 38. Fig. 4b
   shows the arrangement consisting of the longitudinal profile 13 and the tubular wall 38 after a
   lengthwise cut has been made, wherein a first slot 36 was created in the tubular wall 38 of the tower
15 section 7, 8 and a second slot 46 in the web 43c of the H profile 43. Fig. 4c finally shows the
   threaded bolts 39a, nuts 39c and spacing elements 37 led through through holes 40 of the legs 43a,
   43b in the course of the installation at the construction site and the thus securely connected section
   segments 18, once again only showing a cutout of the tubular wall 38.
20 Fig. 5 shows a longitudinal profile 13 in the form of another U profile 53, but one which has been
   rotated about its longitudinal axis by 180' as compared to the arrangement in Fig. 3a, 3b, 3c. The U
   profile 53 contrary to the sample embodiment of Fig. 3a, 3b, 3c has been welded by the legs 53a,
   53b by means of the welded seams 54a and 54b to the as yet undivided tubular wall 38. The further
   fabrication steps are essentially as represented and described in Fig. 4b and 4c.
25
   Another advantageous arrangement, not shown, has in place of a U profile 33 per Fig. 3a, 3b, 3c a C
   profile open on top. The C profile by contrast with the U profile 33 has two inwardly curved right
   angle prolongations of the legs, the open end surfaces of these prolongations facing each other and
   their spacing corresponding substantially to the width of the slot in the web. The C profile has the
30 further advantage that the spacing elements 37 are not needed during a later installation of the
   section segments 18, since the mentioned prolongations are drawn toward each other and thus take

                                                    - 11
   on the function of the spacing elements 37, achieving an advantageous reduction in the installation
   time.
   Besides the above profiles of Fig. 3, 4 and 5, having a web which joins the legs together, Fig. 15a,
 5  15b, 15c show a longitudinal profile 30 which is welded by two lateral welded seams 34a, 34b to
   the tubular wall. The longitudinal profile 30 has two legs 33a, 33b, which are separated from each
   other by a groove 32. The groove 32 has a groove bottom in the longitudinal profile 30. In the
   groove there is provided a borehole 29, which extends in the longitudinal direction of the
   longitudinal profile 30. Upon severing the tower wall 38 in the region 36, the groove bottom is also
10 severed and the two legs 33a, 33b are independent of each other. Since the width of the separating
   slot in the region 36 is larger than the groove width 32, the legs remain behind without web
   sections. Instead, these have separation sections on the mutually facing sides of the legs, which are
   formed by the severing of the tower wall and the longitudinal profile. The legs 33a, 33b are
   connected by welding at their mutually facing sides to the tower wall 38. If the severed section
15 segments are supposed to be joined together once more with the aid of the severed longitudinal
   profile 30, an orientation can be done by a centering pin in the borehole 29. Thanks to the centering
   pin, the legs 33a, 33b are oriented relative to each other and can thus be fastened to each other by
   the threaded bolt 39a, the washer 39b and the nut 39c.
20 Fig. 6 shows a top view of an annular flange 12 with an indicated detail "A". Fig. 7 shows an
   enlarged cutout and Fig. 8 a cross section view of detail "A". The annular flange per Fig. 6, 7, 8 is
   designed as a T-annular flange 69, which is intended to attach the lowermost tower section 7 to the
   foundation 3 and its projecting anchor bolts (not shown). The T-annular flange 69 has separation
   sections with reduced material thickness at predetermined positions, where the annular flange can
25 be divided into three annular flange segments 21, 22, 23. At each predetermined position of a
   separation section, the cross section of the T-annular flange 69 is reduced by two slots 63, so that
   only a narrow segment connection 62 remains. This segment connection 62 will be severed later in
   the fabrication process, namely, only after the welding of the T-annular flange 69 to a section piece
   28 of the tower section 7. Furthermore, the T-annular flange 69 has a plurality of through holes 60,
30 which are arranged on either side of the web 61 in two concentric circles of holes.

                                                    - 12
   For the connecting of the tower sections 7, 8, 9 to each other, annular flanges 12 are provided in the
   form of L-annular flanges 64, having two legs 65, 66 arranged at right angles to each other, as
   shown in Fig. 9, 10. The first leg 65, pointing out from the plane of the drawing in Fig. 9, is butt
   welded to a section piece 28 of the tower section 7, 8 and thus forms a section of the outer shell of
 5 the tower section 7, 8. The second leg 66, directed inward in the plane of the drawing, has a
   plurality of through holes 60 for connection means 39, in order to connect the L-annular flange 64
   to the adjoining L-annular flange 64 of an adjoining tower section 7, 8. Thus, the two L-annular
   flanges 64 form a pair of annular flanges. As can be seen again in Fig. 9 and 10, the L-annular
   flange 64 is provided with separation sections at predetermined positions, where the annular flange
10 can be divided into three annular flange segments 21, 22, 23. At the predetermined position of the
   separation sections the cross section of the L-annular flange 64 is reduced by a slot 68, so that a
   narrow segment connection 67 exists. This segment connection 67 will be severed later in the
   fabrication process after the welding of the L-annular flange 64 to a section piece 28. The segment
   connection 67 forms the separation section for the L-annular flange 64.
15
   The choice of the connection means 39 is not limited to threaded bolts 39a, washers 39b and nuts
   39c, but rather many other connection means are likewise suitable, especially screw connections
   such as threaded rods with nuts provided on both sides, threaded sleeves with threaded bolts
   provided at both sides, etc.
20
   Fig. 11 shows a top view and Fig. 12 a cross section view of a cutout of an adapter plate 70
   mounted on an L-annular flange 64 of a tower section, serving for the connecting or supporting of
   the tower section during a further processing and especially during a severing of the tower section.
   The L-annular flange 64 is connected to the adapter plate 70 by a screw connection consisting of
25 threaded bolts 39a and nuts 39c. The adapter plate 70 has a one-sided slot 71 for the passage of a
   cutting tool 99. After a severing of the segment connection 67 in the separation section, the annular
   flange segments 21, 22, 23 remain connected with the adapter plate 70 and are thus fixed in their
   position.
30 Fig. 13 shows an overall perspective view of a tower section 7 in a supporting device 80 for the
   lengthwise cutting of tower sections in their 6 o'clock position. The supporting device 80 comprises
   two rotatable receiving wheels 81, which are supported by roller bearings 85, 86 running on rails
   9821297_1(GHMattes) P107483.AU

                                                     - 13
   84, while the rollers of the roller bearings 85, 86 could be driven by means of electric motors. The
   rotatable receiving wheels 81 are each connected to an annular flange 12 at the end faces of the
   tower section 7, 8 directly or by means of an adapter plate 70. The receiving wheels 81 have a
   wheel hub 82, which is connected by spokes 83 to an outer ring. In one modification, not shown, the
 5 receiving wheels 81 may be rotatably mounted in the wheel hub 82 by means of mandrels instead of
   roller bearings 85, 86. On the rails 84 is arranged a cutting device 90 which can move by means of a
   feeding drive, with the travel of the cutting device 90 extending over the entire length of a tower
   section.
10 Fig. 14 shows a perspective view of the cutting device 90 for the lengthwise cutting of tower
   sections 7, 8 in the 6 o'clock position. The cutting device 90 comprises a cutting tool 99, preferably
   designed as a side milling cutter or a saw blade. The cutting tool 99 is rotatably mounted in a
   vertically adjustable tool holder 96. The tool holder 96 furthermore comprises guide rollers 98. On
   both sides of the cutting tool 99 and the tool holder 96 there are provided support rollers 97 along
15 with support roller lifting devices 94, 95, which ensure a constant cutting depth of the cutting tool
   99 in the material, especially in the tubular wall 38 of a tower section 7, 8. The tool holder 96 and
   the support roller lifting devices 94, 95 are held on a cross beam 91, which connects two driving
   frames 92, 93 for two feeding drives, not shown. The feeding drives actuate in synchronism the
   driving wheels which are guided on the rails 84.
20
   One sample embodiment not shown has separate height-adjustable punches for lifting the tower
   section mounted in the supporting device in order to compensate for a buckling resulting from the
   force of gravity of the tower section mounted between its bearing points. In order to position the
   punches optimally in height - in the sense of a straight cutting line - at least one optical sensor is
25 provided, which is connected to a control circuit for controlling the punch height. The cutting
   device 90 is mounted and guided movably on rails by means of at least one feeding drive. Thanks to
   the punches which are independent of the cutting device 90, the loading on the cutting device is
   considerably reduced, especially thanks to the force of gravity not needing to be supported. The
   cutting device according to this second sample embodiment can be more simple in design than the
30 cutting device 90 in the sample embodiment of Fig. 13 and Fig. 14 on account of the functional
   separation; in particular, the support rollers 97 plus the support roller lifting devices 94, 95 shown
   9821297_1(GHMattes) P107483.AU

                                                     - 14
   there can be eliminated. Another advantage is that the feeding drives of the cutting device 90 only
   need to provide a power corresponding to the feeding/cutting force.
   Another especially advantageous supporting device, not shown, has two spaced apart, horizontally
 5 arranged girders as a bearing bed for a tower section 7, 8 being machined, having slanting or
   concave receiving portions arranged in pairs. The spacing of the girders is larger than the greatest
   width of the cutting device, so that it can move freely on the rails beneath the tower section, the
   rails being preferably laid in a channel in the floor as a kind of subfloor. The cutting device can be
   driven by at least one feeding drive. This cutting device in turn can be more simple in design than
10 the cutting device 90 of the sample embodiment in Fig. 13 and 14; in particular, the support rollers
   97 plus the support roller lifting devices 94, 95 shown there can be eliminated. Another advantage is
   that the feeding drives of the cutting device 90 only need to be designed for a power corresponding
   to the feeding/cutting force, since they do not need to overcome any supporting load component.

                          arranged one on top of another in a tower lengthwise direction,
 5                 -      defining of at least two planned separation lines running in the tower lengthwise
                          direction for one of the tower sections and providing of a longitudinal profile for the
                         planned separation line, having two legs running parallel and at a distance from each
                          other, wherein the longitudinal profile is formed as a single piece with its legs,
                   -      connecting of the longitudinal profile to the tower section, wherein the legs are
10                        connected to the tower section on opposite sides of the separation line,
                   -      severing of the tower section along the separation line into section segments separated
                          from each other by a segment boundary, wherein the monolithic longitudinal profile is
                          also severed and each of the legs remains connected to a section segment on a
                          different side of the segment boundary,
15                 -      connecting of two or more section segments by the legs of the severed longitudinal
                         profile to a tower section and
                   -      connecting of several tower sections in the tower lengthwise direction to form a steel
                          tower.
20  14.          The method as claimed in claim 13, wherein the monolithic longitudinal profile has two
   legs running parallel to each other and joined together by a web, wherein the web is also severed
   during the severing of the tower section.
    15.          The method as claimed in claim 13, wherein the longitudinal profile prior to the severing
25 of the section segments has a profile body with a groove arranged on a side facing away from a
   tower wall and after the severing of the section segments it has two legs, which have a separation
   section on their mutually facing sides, which has been formed during the mutual severing of the
   section segments and the longitudinal profile.
30  16.          The method as claimed in one of claims 13 to 15, wherein the tower section is brought by
   means of a hoist or an industrial truck above at least one movable cutting device (90) and set down

   on supporting means such that the first planned separation line (19) is positioned in a 6 o'clock
   position.
    17.          The method as claimed in one of claims 13 to 16, characterized by a further method step
 5 during which a closed annular flange (12) in a predetermined position with respect to the
   circumferential direction for the forming of a tower section (7, 8) is welded onto the tower section
   and/or to one end surface of a section piece (28), the annular flange (12) having a reduced cross
   section at predetermined positions and the predetermined positions coinciding with the planned
   separation lines (19) of the tower section.

    18.          The method as claimed in claim 17, characterized by a further method step during which
   the closed annular flange (12) is connected at the end face to a receiving wheel (81) and the tower
   section is rotated via the receiving wheels into a desired position.
15  19.          The method as claimed in one of claims 13 to 18, characterized by the method step that the
   tower section is placed by means of a hoist or an industrial truck onto a supporting device with two
   bearing regions spaced apart from each other, the tower section (7, 8) being positioned such that the
   first planned separation line (19) runs between the bearing regions in a 6 o'clock position.
20 20.           The method as claimed in claim 13 or 19, characterized by the method step that at least one
   movable cutting device (90) is moved into a starting position near a first annular flange (12) and
   then the cutting tool (99) is brought into contact by means of a vertically movable tool holder (96)
   with the first annular flange (12) at the first predetermined position.
25 21.           The method as claimed in claim 20, wherein the first annular flange (12) is severed by
   means of the cutting tool (99) at a first predetermined position with reduced cross section and
   immediately thereafter the cutting tool (99) is moved continuously along the first separation line
   (19) through the tubular wall (38) as well as the longitudinal profile (13) connected to the tubular
   wall.
