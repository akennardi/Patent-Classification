Abstract
The present invention relates to the use of a nutritional composition having a low
amount of protein, such as less than 1.8 g/100 kcal for administration to infants of
non-obese and non-overweight mothers so as to reduce the risk of developing
metabolic syndrome, increased weight gain, increased fat deposition, overweight,
obesity, insulin resistance, glucose intolerance or diabetes mellitus later in said
infant's life.

   Use of nutritional compositions having a low protein amount
   Technical field of the invention
   The present invention relates to the uses of a nutritional composition with a
 5 protein content less than 1.8g/100 kcal to an infant born to a non-obese and non
   overweight mother. In particular the present invention relates to the use of said
   nutritional composition for reducing the risk of an infant fed with said nutritional
   composition    to  develop   metabolic   syndrome,   overweight,  obesity,  glucose
   intolerance or diabetes mellitus later in life. Furthermore, the present invention
10 relates to the use of a nutritional composition to obtain a hormonal profile closer
   to that of breast fed infants, to reduce the protein burden on non-mature organs
   in the infant and to promote a rate of growth of the infant which approximates the
   rate of growth of a breast fed infant at the same age.
15 Background of the invention
   Mother's milk is recommended for all infants up to the age of 4-6 months.
   However,    in some    cases breast feeding     is inadequate or unsuccessful or
   inadvisable for medical reasons, or the mother chooses not to breast feed either
   at all or for a period of more than a few weeks. Infant formulas have been
20 developed for these situations.
   The prevalence of obesity and overweight in adults, children and adolescents has
   increased rapidly over the past 30 years in the United States and globally and it
   continues to rise. Overweight and obesity are classically defined based on the
25 percentages of body fat or, more recently, the body mass index of BMI. The BMI
   is defined as the ratio of weight in kilograms divided by the height in metres,
   squared.
   As overweight and obesity become more prevalent in all age groups, the number
30 of women giving birth who are also overweight or obese is also increasing.
   It is known that overweight and obese women who become pregnant have a
   greater risk of developing gestational diabetes. Maternal hyperglycaemia may lead
   to infants with increased body size and fat mass and such infants are themselves

   WO 2015/078505                                                  PCT/EP2013/075050
                                            2
    prone to develop obesity or diabetes later in childhood or in adult life. An
    increasing weight of scientific evidence suggests that infants born to obese
    mothers have a greater risk of becoming overweight or obese later in life than
    infants born to mothers who are not obese.
 5
    However, childhood obesity and overweight seem to be more and more common
    today, even though neither the mother nor the father of the child is obese.
    Childhood overweight and obesity currently affect 18 million children under the
    age of 5 worldwide. Almost 30% of US children and adolescents, and between 10
10 and 30% of European children are overweight or obese.
    It is well known that infants fed with infant formula obtain a higher weight gain
    than breast fed infants. Infant formula fed infants may therefore be more prone to
    become overweight or obese later in life.
15
    Hence, there is an unmet need for a nutritional composition to be used for
    administration to infants of non-obese and non-overweight mothers to reduce the
    risk of developing overweight, obesity, diabetes and metabolic syndrome later in
    life.
20
    Further, there is a need for a nutritional composition to be used in feeding infants
    of non-obese and non-overweight mothers, said nutritional composition promoting
    a growth rate of the infant which approximates the growth rate of an infant being
    breast fed, i.e. normalizes the growth rate of an infant.
25
    Further, infant formulas on the market today have a high content of proteins,
    which is higher than the protein content in the human breast milk. High amount of
    proteins may cause damage to non-mature organs in an infant. Thus, there is a
    need for an infant formula which may reduce the protein burden on non-mature
30 organs in the infant.
    Summary of the invention
    Thus, an object of the present invention relates to the use of a nutritional
    composition for administration to an infant, wherein said nutritional compositions

   WO 2015/078505                                                   PCT/EP2013/075050
                                             3
    can reduce the risk of the infant to develop metabolic syndrome, overweight,
    obesity, glucose intolerance and diabetes mellitus later in said infant's life and can
    normalize the growth rate of the infant and reduce the protein burden on non
    mature organs.
 5
    It is a further object of the present invention to use a nutritional composition for
    feeding infants in order to obtain a hormonal profile which is closer to that of
    breast fed infants.
10 In particular, it is an object of the present invention to provide a nutritional
    composition for use in administration to infants that solves the above mentioned
    problems with known nutritional compositions for infants such as infant formulas,
    since the known infants formulas have a high content of proteins and energy
    content which promotes a higher growth rate than breast fed children, a higher
15 risk of obtaining obesity later in life and the damage of non-mature organs.
    While obesity in childhood and adolescence is increasing to the point where it is
    starting to be of serious concern to healthcare professionals, there are many
    contributory factors to obesity, including nutritional, environmental and inherited
20 factors. It is recognized that the likelihood of developing a nutritional product
    which is effective in reducing this risk of developing obesity in the infant
    population at large is remote. However, without being bound by any theory, the
    inventors of the present invention believe that it is possible to reduce the risk of
    future overweight or obesity by feeding an infant with a nutritional composition
25 according to the invention.
    As research into the composition of human milk continues, increasing attention is
    being paid to the extent to which its composition changes over the period of
    lactation. These changes are particularly pronounced as regards protein quality
30 and quantity. Dietary protein provides the essential amino acids necessary for
    protein synthesis and growth. Nutritional compositions to be fed to infants are
    usually based on cows' milk but the amino acid profile of cows' milk is noticeably
    different from that of human milk which, in addition, has the lowest protein
    concentration found in any mammalian milk. In the past, in order to supply
35 enough of the essential amino acids, infant formulas based on cows' milk had to

   WO 2015/078505                                                     PCT/EP2013/075050
                                             4
    have a protein content significantly higher than that of the human milk. More
    recently, it has been realised that the total protein quantity can be reduced whilst
    still meeting the minimum requirements for essential amino acids by a judicious
    selection of protein sources supplemented if necessary by small quantities of free
 5 amino acids.
    However, this line of development does not take account of the physiological
    properties of particular proteins and the evolution of protein content of human
    milk over time. Human milk is generally considered to be whey predominant and a
10 range of "whey-adapted" formulas have been developed based on this. However,
    this fails to take account of the fact that the casein to whey ratio (casein:whey) of
    human milk varies over time from 20:80 in the first few days of lactation to 50:50
    after five to six months after lactation. Furthermore, the protein content of human
    milk is likewise not constant over time and may vary between 1.8 and 1.3
15 g/100kcal depending upon the duration of lactation.
    Earlier, a connection has been established between the protein content in an
    infant formula and infants having a high risk of developing obesity later in life,
    because they are born from mothers being obese before being pregnant. It was
20 shown that by decreasing the protein content in infant formulas, the IGF-1 level in
    infants of obese mothers was decreased. It was not expected by anyone that this
    effect could also be seen for infants born to non-obese and non-overweight
    mothers, i.e. under weight or normal weight mothers.
25 However, the inventors of the present invention have surprisingly found out that
    when feeding an infant of a non-obese and non-overweight mother with a
    nutritional composition comprising a controlled amount of protein, i.e. less than
    1.8 g/100 kcal protein, but still supplying sufficient quantities of other nutrients
    which are essential for growth and development, the IGF-1 level in the infant will
30 decrease. Hereby is provided a hormonal profile closer to that of breast fed infants
    and the risk of the infant to develop obesity later in life is reduced. The infant will
    usually be fed with the nutritional composition according to the invention from the
    age of 3 months, since the need of proteins for an infant is higher immediately
    after birth, but decreases with age.

    Further, the inventors of the present invention have surprisingly found out that
    the administration of a nutritional composition comprising a controlled amount of
    protein,  i.e. less than 1.8 g/100 kcal protein,       but still supplying sufficient
    quantities of other nutrients which are essential for growth and development, to
 5 an infant born to a non-obese and non-overweight mother will promote a growth
    rate in the infant which approximates to the growth rate which is observed in
    infants fed with human breast milk at the same age. Furthermore, by feeding
    infants with a low amount of proteins, such as less than 1.8 g/100 kcal, the
    protein burden on non-mature organs of the infant is reduced.

    protein source, a lipid source and a carbohydrate source, wherein the protein
    content is less than 1.8 g/kcal for use in administration to an infant born to a non
    obese and non-overweight mother in the first year of the life or the infant so as to

    Numerical ranges as used herein are intended to include every number and subset
    of numbers contained within that range, whether specifically disclosed or not.
    Further, these numerical ranges should be construed as providing support for a
    claim directed to any number or subset of numbers in that range. For example, a
10 disclosure of from 1 to 10 should be construed as supporting a range of from 1 to
    8, from 3 to 7, from 1 to 9, from 3.6 to 4.6, from 3.5 to 9.9, and so forth. All
    references to singular characteristics or limitations of the present invention shall
    include the corresponding plural characteristic or limitation, and vice versa, unless
    otherwise specified or clearly implied to the contrary by the context in which the
15 reference is made.
    In   the   context   of  the   present  invention,   the   term   "ratio"  by   weight
    (weight/weight)    refers to the ratio between the weights of the mentioned
    compounds. For example, a mixture comprising 60 g whey and 40 g casein would
20 have a weight ratio which is equal to 60:40, which is equal to 3:2 or 1.5 (that is 3
    divided with 2). Similarly, a mixture of 50 g whey and 50 g casein would have a
    ratio by weight of whey and casein of 50:50, which is equal to 1:1 or 1 (that is 1
    divided with 1).
25 The term "and/or" used in the context of the "X and/or Y" should be interpreted as
    "X", or "Y", or "X and Y".
    Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the
    same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art.

    In the context of the present invention, the infant may be any term infant or
    preterm infant. In an embodiment of the invention, the infant is selected from the
    group of preterm infants and term infants.
 5 The "nutritional composition" can be a synthetic nutritional composition, i.e. not of
    human origin (e.g. this is not breast milk). It can be an infant formula, a starter
    infant formula, a follow-on formula, an infant cereal, a fortifier such as a human
    milk fortifier, or a supplement. In a particular embodiment, it is an infant formula.
10 The expression "synthetic composition" means a mixture obtained by chemical
    and/or biological means, which can be chemically identical to the mixture
    naturally occurring in mammalian milks.
    The term "infant formula" as used herein refers to a nutritional composition
15 intended for infants and as defined in Codex Alimentarius, (Codex STAN 72-1981)
    and Infant Specialities (incl. Food for Special Medical Purpose) as defined in Codex
    Alimentarius, (Codex STAN 72-1981). It also refers to a foodstuff intended for
    particular nutritional use by infants during the first months of life and satisfying by
    itself the nutritional requirements of this category of person (Article 2(c) of the
20 European Commission Directive 91/321/EEC 2006/141/EC of 22 December 2006
    on infant formulae and follow-on formulae). The infant formulas can encompass
    the starter infant formulas and the follow-up or follow-on formulas. Generally a
    starter formula is for infants from birth as breast-milk substitute, and a follow-up
    or follow-on formula from the 6th month onwards.
25
    The expressions "later in life" or "later in said infant's life" refer in the context of
    the present invention to effects measured in the child after the age of 1 year of
    life, such as after the age of 2 years, preferably after the age of 4 years, such as
    after the age of 5 years, even more preferably after the age of 7 years of life and
30 as a comparison to average observations for subjects of the same age, but not
    having the same conditions because fed with another nutrition.
    The term "normal growth rate of a breast fed infant" means the growth rate for
    breast fed infants set out in Acta Oaediatrica, Vol 95, April 2006, Supplement 450
35 "WHO Child Growth Standards".

                                           10
    "Rate of growth" refers to growth in weight, height, head circumference of an
    infant.
 5 The term "obese mother" means a woman with a BMI of at least 30 prior to
    establishment of pregnancy.
    The term "overweight mother" means a woman with a BMI between 25 and below
    30 prior to establishment of pregnancy.
10
    The term "normal weight mother" means a woman with a BMI between 18.5 and
    below 25 prior to establishment of pregnancy.
    The term "underweight mother" means a woman with a BMI below 18.5 prior to
15 establishment      of  pregnancy.   This   expression  encompasses   the   "severely
    underweight" mothers, i.e. mothers with a BMI less than 16.5.
    The term "non-obese mother" means a woman with a BMI below 30 prior to
    establishment of pregnancy.
20
    In the present invention, the infant is born to "a non-obese and non-overweight
    mother". This means that the infant is born to a mother who is neither obese nor
    overweight prior to establishment of pregnancy. It therefore means that the infant
    is born to a mother with a BMI below 25 prior to establishment of pregnancy. The
25 "non-obese and non-overweight mother" will be either a "normal weight mother",
    i.e. a mother with a BMI between 18.5 and below 25 prior to establishment of
    pregnancy, or an "underweight mother", i.e. a mother with a BMI below 18.5 prior
    to establishment of pregnancy.
30 BMI refers to body mass index and is a measure for weight. BMI is defined as the
    ratio of weight in kilograms divided by height in metres, squared.
    An infant    born to an obese or an overweight mother will          have different
    physiological conditions than an infant born to a non-obese and non-overweight
35 mother. The reason for this is that maternal obesity will cause that the foetus is

                                           11
    developed in an insulegenic environment. This causes a gestational weight gain,
    elevated adiposity, hyperglycemia and insulin resistance in the infant of the obese
    mother. Thus, infants of obese mothers will have an increased risk of childhood
    obesity and subsequent adult diseases, such as diabetes. Infants of overweight
 5 mothers may have some of the symptoms described above (but in a less degree).
    An infant from a non-obese and non-overweight mother will not have the
    symptoms described above. Infants of normal weight mothers and underweight
    mothers do not have any of the described symptoms, since their gestational
    development has not been in an increased insulinogenic environment.
10
    The term "protein      content"  means total content of proteinaceous         material
    including free amino acids (if present).
    All percentages and ratios are by weight unless otherwise specified.
15
    The term "hormonal profile" refers in the context to the content of hormones
    present in the blood of an infant, e.g. the amounts of IGF-1 measured in the blood
    of an infant.
20 The term "IGF-1" refers to the hormone "insulin-like growth factor-i".
    The expressions "non-mature organs", "unmature organs" and "immature organs"
    can be used interchangeably.

    The energy density of the nutritional composition according to the present
    invention is specified as the number of kilocalories per litre (kcal/I). Furthermore,
    the energy density refers in the context of powdered products, to the product
    after reconstitution according to the directions provided with the product.
30
    The term "energy density" may also be termed "caloric density". The terms may
    be used interchangeably.
    In an aspect of the invention, the energy density of the nutritional composition
35 according to the invention is less than 680 kcal/l, such as from 600 to 680 kcal/l,

   WO 2015/078505                                                   PCT/EP2013/075050
                                          12
    such as from 620 to 680 kcal/l, such as from 620 to 650 kcal/l, particularly 620
    kcal/l or particularly 640 kcal/l. In some embodiments the energy density may
    also be from 650 to 680 kcal/l, particularly 670 kcal/l.
 5 Proteins:
    In the context of the present invention, the term "protein" refers to both proteins
    derived from a source of protein, peptides and to free amino acids in general.
    Furthermore, the term "protein" refers to one or more proteins.
10 The nutritional composition of the present invention has a protein content of less
    than 1.8 g/100 kcal.
    In an embodiment of the invention the protein content is between 1.4 and 1.75
    g/100 kcal, such as between 1.4 and 1.7 g/100 kcal, between 1.5 and 1.7 g/100
15 kcal, or between 1.5 and 1.65 g/100 kcal, or between 1.5 and 1.6 g/100 kcal. In a
    particular embodiment the protein content is 1.61 g/100 kcal.
    In a particular embodiment the protein content is 1.69 g/100 kcal. In some
    particular embodiments the protein content is between 1.6 and 1.75 g/100 kcal
    such as between 1.6 and 1.75 g/100 kcal, or between 1.61 and 1.69 g/100 kcal.
20
    The detailed make-up of the protein source is not believed to be critical to the
    present invention provided that the minimum requirements or essential amino
    acid content are met and satisfactory growth is ensured. However, in a particular
    embodiment of the invention the protein sources are based on cow's milk proteins
25 such as whey, casein and mixtures thereof. Furthermore, protein sources based
    on soy can be used.     In an embodiment of the invention, the protein is selected
    from the group of milk proteins, animal proteins, vegetable proteins, cereal
    proteins,   free  amino    acids  or   combinations    thereof.  The   milk   protein
    advantageously includes casein and/or whey protein.
30
    In an embodiment of the invention, the protein source comprises at least 20% of
    casein, such as at least 25% casein, e.g. at least 30% casein, or at least 35%
    casein, such as at least 40% casein.

   WO 2015/078505                                                    PCT/EP2013/075050
                                           13
    In an embodiment of the invention, the protein source comprises at least 20% of
    whey, such as at least 30% whey, such as at least 40% whey, or at least 50%
    whey, such as at least 55% whey, particularly at least 60% whey.
 5 In another embodiment of the invention the protein is made of mixtures of casein
    and whey proteins. The casein to whey ratio is typically in the range of 0:100 to
    50:50, such as 30:70 to 70:30, such as 40:60 to 60:40, in particular 45:55 to
    40:60, and advantageously 40:60.
10 In a particular embodiment there is no casein but 100% of whey.
    The protein(s) in the protein source may be intact or partially hydrolysed or a
    combination of intact and hydrolysed proteins.
15 In an embodiment of the invention, the protein(s) in the protein source is
    hydrolysed.
    In another embodiment of the invention, the protein(s) in the protein source is
    intact.
20
    The term "intact" means in the context of the present invention proteins where
    the molecular structure of the protein(s) is not altered according to conventional
    meaning of intact proteins. By the term "intact" is meant that the main part of the
    proteins are intact, i.e. the molecular structure is not altered, for example at least
25 80% of the proteins are not altered, such as at least 85% of the proteins are not
    altered, e.g. at least 90% of the proteins are not altered, or at least 95% of the
    proteins are not altered, such as at least 98% of the proteins are not altered. In a
    particular embodiment, 100% of the proteins are not altered.
30 The term "hydrolysed" means in the context of the present invention a protein
    which has been hydrolysed or broken down into its component peptides or amino
    acids.
    The proteins may either be fully or partially hydrolysed. In an embodiment of the
35 invention at least 70% of the proteins are hydrolysed, preferably at least 80% of

   WO 2015/078505                                                 PCT/EP2013/075050
                                           14
    the proteins are hydrolysed, such as at least 85% of the proteins are hydrolysed,
    even more preferably at least 90% of the proteins are hydrolysed, such as at least
    95% of the proteins are hydrolysed, particularly at least 98% of the proteins are
    hydrolysed. In a particular embodiment, 100% of the proteins are hydrolysed.
 5
    Hydrolysis of proteins may be achieved by many means, for example by
    prolonged boiling in a strong acid or a strong base or by using an enzyme such as
    the pancreatic protease enzyme to stimulate the naturally occurring hydrolytic
    process.
10
    The protein(s) according to the present invention may also be derived from free
    amino acids, or a combination of free amino acids and a source of protein, such as
    whey and casein. In some cases it might be necessary to supplement a source of
    protein   with free amino     acids, if it is necessary to    meet the minimum
15 requirements for essential amino acid content. These requirements are published
    for example in EC Directive 91/321/EEC.
    As noted above, the protein source may be a mixture of casein and whey proteins.
20 The whey protein may be a whey protein isolate, acid whey, sweet whey or sweet
    whey from which the caseino-glycomacropeptide has been removed (modified
    sweet whey). Preferably, however, the whey protein is modified sweet whey.
    Sweet whey is a readily available by-product of cheese making and is frequently
    used   in the manufacture of nutritional compositions       based on cows'     milk.
25 However, sweet whey includes a component which is undesirably rich in threonine
    and poor in tryptophan called caseino-glycomacropeptide (cGMP). Removal of the
    cGMP from sweet whey results in a protein with a threonine content closer to that
    of human milk. A process for removing cGMP from sweet whey is described in
    EP880902.
30
    If modified sweet whey is used as the whey protein in a mixture of 60% whey and
    40%    casein,  the  protein source     is advantageously  supplemented    by free
    tryptophan, isoleucine, histidine and phenylalanine in amounts of up to 0.34% for
    tryptophan, 0.92% for isoleucine, 0.19% for histidine and 2.2% for phenylalanine
35 (in each case as a percentage by weight of total protein content). If intact sweet

   WO 2015/078505                                                      PCT/EP2013/075050
                                              15
    whey is used as the whey protein in a mixture of 60% whey and 40% casein, the
    protein source is preferably supplemented by free tryptophan, leucine, histidine
    and phenylalanine in amounts of up to 0.5% for tryptophan, 0.73% for leucine,
    0.3% for histidine and 2.5% for phenylalanine (in each case as a percentage by
 5 weight of total protein content).
    In an embodiment of the present invention the whey protein is sweet whey from
    which the caseino-glycomacropeptide has been removed and the composition
    additionally includes free phenylalanine in an amount of up to 2.2%, free
10 isoleucine in an amount of up to 0.92%, free tryptophan in an amount of up to
    0.34% and free histidine in an amount of up to 0.19%, in each as a percentage by
    weight of total protein content. The above described protein of sweet whey has a
    good amino acid profile that is as close as possible to the amino acid profile of the
    human breast milk.
15
    Carbohydrates:
    The    nutritional composition     of the present invention contains a source of
    carbohydrates. The preferred source of carbohydrates is lactose although other
    carbohydrates such as saccharose, maltodextrin and/or starch may also be added.
20 Advantageously, the carbohydrate content present in the nutritional composition
    is between 9 and 14 g/100 kcal.
    In an embodiment of the invention, the carbohydrate source is lactose.
25 Lipids:
    The nutritional composition of the present invention also contains a source of
    lipids. The lipid source may be any lipid or fat which is suitable for use in
    nutritional compositions to be fed to infants. Preferred fat sources include coconut
    oil, low erucic rapeseed oil (canola oil), soy lecithin, palm olein and/or sunflower
30 oil. The essential polyunsaturated fatty acids linoleic acid and a-linolenic acid may
    also be added as small amounts of oils containing high quantities of preformed
    long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids arachidonic acid and docosahexaenoic acid,
    e.g. fish oils or single cell oils. In total, the lipid content may be between 4.4 and
    6 g/100 kcal.

  WO 2015/078505                                                    PCT/EP2013/075050
                                           16
   In an embodiment of the present invention, the ratio of linoleic acid (C18:2n-6) to
   a-linolenic acid    (C18:3n-3)    in  the  lipid  source  is between    5:1 to   15:1,
   advantageously between 7:1 and 15:1, such as 8:1.
 5 In another embodiment of the present invention, the ratio of arachidonic acid
   (C20:4n-6) to docosahexaenoic acid (C22:6n-3) in the lipid source is between 2:1
   and 1:1.
   Vitamins and minerals:
10 The nutritional composition may also contain all vitamins and minerals understood
   to be essential in the daily diet in nutritionally significant amounts. Minimum
   requirements have been established for certain vitamins and minerals. Examples
   of minerals, vitamins and other nutrients optionally present in the nutritional
   composition include vitamin A, vitamin B1,        vitamin B2, vitamin B6, vitamin E,
15 vitamin K, vitamin C, vitamin D, folic acid, inositol, niacin, biotin, pantothenic
   acid,   choline,  calcium,   phosphor,    iodine,   iron, magnesium,    copper,   zinc,
   manganese,     chloride, potassium, sodium, selenium, chromium,          molybdenum,
   taurine, and L-carnitine. The minerals are usually added in salt form.
20 Emulsifiers:
   If necessary, the nutritional composition may contain emulsifiers and stabilisers
   such as lecithin, e.g. soy lecithin, monoglycerides, diglycerides or citric esters of
   mono-    and   di-glycerides, and    the like. This is especially the case if the
   composition is provided in liquid form and particularly if the content of lipids is
25 high.
   Compounds with beneficial effect:
   The nutritional composition according to the present invention may optionally
   comprise other compounds which may have a beneficial effect such as probiotics
30 (like probiotic bacteria), fibres, lactoferrin, nucleotides, nucleosides, and the like
   in the amounts customarily found in nutritional compositions to be fed to infants.
   Strains of Lactobacillus are the most common microbes employed as probiotics.
   However, other probiotic strains than Lactobabillus may be used in the present

   WO 2015/078505                                                     PCT/EP2013/075050
                                            17
    nutritional composition,    for example Bifidobacterium      and certain yeasts and
    bacilli.
    The probiotic microorganisms most commonly used are principally bacteria and
    yeasts    of the    following  genera:     Lactobacillus spp.,   Streptococcus     spp.,
 5 Enterococcus spp., Bifidobacterium spp. and Saccharomyces spp.
    In some particular embodiments, the probiotic is a probiotic bacterial strain.
    Probiotic bacteria are bacteria which have a beneficial effect on the intestinal
    system of humans and other animals.
    In some specific embodiments, it is particularly Bifidobacteria and/or Lactobacilli.
10
    In an embodiment of the invention, the nutritional composition further includes a
    probiotic strain such as a probiotic bacterial strain in an amount of from 106 to
    1011  cfu/g of composition (dry weight).
15 A probiotic is a microbial cell preparation or components of microbial cells with a
    beneficial effect on the health or well-being of the host. Suitable probiotic
    bacterial strains include Lactobacillus rhamnosus ATCC 53103 obtainable from
    Valio Oy of Finland under the trademark LGG, Lactobacillus rhamnosus CGMCC
    1.3724, Lactobacillus paracasei CNCM 1-2116, Bifidobacterium lactis CNCM 1.3446
20 sold by inter alia by the Christian Hansen company of Denmark under the
    trademark Bb12 and Bifidobacterium longum ATCC BAA-999 sold by Morigana Milk
    Industry Co. Ltd. of japan under the trademark BB536. The amount of probiotic, if
    present, likewise preferably varies as a function of the age of the infant.
25 Since probiotic bacteria have a beneficial effect on the intestinal flora in a human
    being, also an infant, it is believed by the inventors of the present invention,
    without being bound by any theory, that probiotic bacteria in a nutritional
    composition in combination with a low amount of proteins provide a synergistic
    effect to reduce the risk of an infant fed with said nutritional composition to obtain
30 obesity later in life. Probiotics enable a better utilization of nutrients while
    producing by-products that may have a physiological effect on digestion. The use
    of specific probiotics can therefore improve the uptake and beneficial effect of a
    diet having a high amount of proteins.

   WO 2015/078505                                                    PCT/EP2013/075050
                                          18
    The infant formula may also contain at least one prebiotic in an amount of 0.3 to
    10%. A prebiotic is a non-digestible food ingredient than beneficially affects the
    host by selectively stimulating the growth and/or activity of one or a limited
    number of bacteria in the colon, and thus improves host health. Such ingredients
 5 are non-digestible in the sense that they are not broken down and absorbed in the
    stomach or small intestine and thus pass intact to the colon where they are
    selectively fermented by the beneficial bacteria. Examples of prebiotics include
    certain    oligosaccharides,     such  as     fructooligosaccharides     (FOS)     and
    galactooligosaccharides (GOS). The prebiotics can also be a BMO (bovine's milk
10 oligosaccharide) and/or a HMO (human milk oligosaccharide) such as N-acetylated
    oligosaccharides, sialylated oligosaccharides, fucosylated oligosaccharides and any
    mixtures thereof. A combination of prebiotics may be used such as 90% GOS with
    10% short chain fructo-oligosaccharides such as the product sold under the
    trademark Raftilose® or 10% inulin such as the product sold under the trademark
15 Raftiline®.
    A particularly preferred prebiotic is a mixture of galacto-oligosaccharide(s), N
    acetylated oligosaccharide(s) and sialylated oligosaccharide(s) in which the N
    acetylated oligosaccharide(s) represent(s) 0.5 to 4.0% of the oligosaccharide
20 mixture,    the  galacto-oligosaccharide(s)   represent(s)   92.0   to 98.5%    of the
    oligosaccharide mixture and the sialylated oligosaccharide(s) represent(s) 1.0 to
    4.0% of the oligosaccharide mixture. This mixture is hereinafter referred to as
    "CMOS-GOS". Advantageously, a composition for use according to the invention
    contains from 2.5 to 15.0 wt% CMOS-GOS on a dry matter basis with the proviso
25 that    the  composition    comprises  at   least   0.02   wt%    of an    N-acetylated
    oligosaccharide, at least 2.0 wt% of a galacto-oligosaccharide and at least 0.04
    wt% of a sialylated oligosaccha ride.
    W02006087391 and W02012160080 provide some examples of production of
    CMOS-GOS.

    Uses of the nutritional composition:
    The present invention is directed to a nutritional composition comprising a protein
    source, a lipid source and a carbohydrate source, wherein the protein content is
    less than 1.8 g/100 kcal for use in administration to an infant born to a non-obese
35 and non-overweight mother in the first year of the life of the infant so as to

  WO 2015/078505                                                       PCT/EP2013/075050

   reduce the risk of developing metabolic syndrome,               increased weight     gain,
   increased    fat  deposition,    overweight,    obesity,  insulin    resistance,  glucose
   intolerance or diabetes mellitus later in life.
 5 In the present invention, the infants are born to mothers having a BMI lower than
   25.
   The present invention also relates to a nutritional composition comprising a
   protein source, a lipid source and a carbohydrate source, wherein the protein
10 content is less than 1.8 g/100 kcal for use in administration to an infant born to
   non-obese and non-overweight mothers in the first year of the life of the infant so
   as to obtain a hormonal profile closer to that of breast fed infants.
   By the term "obtain        a hormonal    profile" is meant to "obtain a content of
15 hormones". The hormones refer especially to IGF-1.
   By the term "closer to" in the expression "closer to that of breast fed infants", it is
   meant that the hormonal profile is closer to that of breast fed infants as compared
   to the hormonal profile of infants fed with an infant formula having a protein
20 content above 1.8 g/100 kcal, e.g. above 2.0 g/100 kcal, such as 2.1 g/100 kcal.
   By the term "closer to" it is not meant that the hormonal profile of infants fed with
   a nutritional composition comprising below 1.8 g/100 kcal protein equals the
   hormonal profile of breast fed infants, it is simply meant that the hormonal profile
   is closer to that of breast fed infants than the hormonal profile of infants fed with
25 a standard infant formula (protein above 1.8 g/100 kcal).
   A particular embodiment of the invention relates to the use of a nutritional
   composition comprising a protein source, a lipid source and a carbohydrate
   source, wherein the protein content is less than 1.8 g/100 kcal for use in
30 administration to an infant born to a non-obese and non-overweight mother in the
   first year of the life of the infant so as to obtain an IGF-1 level in the infant which
   is closer to that of breast fed infants than the IGF-1 level in infants fed with a
   nutritional composition comprising protein in an amount above 1.8 g/100 kcal.

  WO 2015/078505                                                  PCT/EP2013/075050
                                          20
   Furthermore, a reduced level of IGF-1 in infants fed with a nutritional composition
   comprising less than 1.8 g/100 kcal will induce a hormonal profile in the infant
   closer to the one of a breast fed infant.
 5 The present invention also relates to a nutritional composition comprising a
   protein source, a lipid source and a carbohydrate source, wherein the protein
   content is less than 1.8 g/100 kcal for use in administration to an infant born to a
   non-obese and non-overweight mother in the first year of the life of the infant so
   as to reduce the protein burden on non-mature organs in the infant.
10 By the term "reduce protein burden" it is meant reducing the amount of proteins
   which can cause damage to non-mature organs in an infant, and reducing the
   burden high amount of proteins can cause.
   It is particularly the preterm infants, the low weight infants and the low for
15 gestational age infant who may have problems with cause of damage, protein
   burden on unmature organs, therefore the infant is in a particularly advantageous
   embodiment a preterm infant, a low weight infant or a low for gestational age
   infant.
20 The present invention also relates to a nutritional composition comprising a
   protein source, a lipid source and a carbohydrate source, wherein the protein
   content is less than 1.8 g/100 kcal for use in administration to an infant born to a
   non-obese and non-overweight mother in the first year of the life of the infant so
   as to promote a rate of growth in that infant which approximates to the rate of
25 growth of a breast fed infant at the same age.
   The term "approximates" refers to a rate of growth which is closer to the one of
   breast fed infants as compared to the growth rate of an infant fed with a standard
   nutritional composition comprising      above 1.8 g/100    kcal protein. The term
30 "approximates" does not mean that the growth rate has to be equal to that of
   breast fed infants, it just has to be closer to that of breast fed infants, than the
   growth rate of infants fed with standard infant formulas are to breast fed infants.

   WO 2015/078505                                                    PCT/EP2013/075050
                                             21
    IGF-1    level   was measured    in   blood    samples  taken from   infants  by any
    conventional method, for example a chemilumiscence kit (Nichols Advantage, S.
    Juan Capistrano, Calif., USA).
 5 The connection between IGF-1 and body weight is well known in the art, see for
    example Savino et al., "Relationships between IGF-1 and Weight Z score, BMI,
    Tripital Skin-Fold Thickness, Type of feeding in Healthy Infants in the First 5
    months of life", Ann Nutr Metab 2005, 49, 83-87, where it is disclosed that
    formula fed infants have a significant higher IGF-1 level and higher body weight
10 than breast fed infants. The document furthermore discloses the relationship
    between IGF-1 levels and body weight. The inventors of the present invention
    believe, without being bound by any theory, that infants having a lower IFG-1
    level will reduce the risk of obtaining obesity later in life. However, a proposed
    mechanism of obesity in formula fed infants compared to breast fed infants is that
15 a high protein intake would promote the secretion of IGF-1, a tropical hormone
    involved in longitudinal growth as well as muscle and fat mass development.
    Thus, by feeding infants with infant formulas having a lower amount of protein
    than conventionally infant formulas, the IGF-1 level in the infant is decreased and
    the risk of obtaining obesity later in life is reduced.
20

   Example
   The following example illustrates a specific embodiment of the infant formula for
   use according to the present invention. The example is given solely for the
   purpose of illustration and is not to be construed as limitations of the present
 5 invention, as many variations thereof are possible without departing from the
   spirit of the invention.
   Example 1
   Example 1 describes a study conducted to study infants being fed with an infant
   formula having a low amount of protein, 1.61 g/100 kcal, (test formula) as
10 compared to a conventional infant formula having a protein content of 2.15 g/100
   kcal (control formula).
   The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the growth of the infants and
   measure the IGF-1 level in the infants at an age of both 6 months and 12 months
   after birth.
15 Both the test formula and the control formula were prepared as a ready-to-feed
   liquid (they were produced as a powder then prepared as a ready-to-feed liquid
   for the administration to the infants). The two formulas, test formula and control
   formula, once reconstituted, are described below in table 1.

 5 The formulas above were fed to infants as the sole nutrition from the age of three
    months to six months and subsequently as part of a mixed diet during the
    introduction of solid foods to the infant until weaning is complete at about the age
    of 12 months.
10 The mothers of the infants in this study came from a normal population and
    therefore contained women which had a normal distribution of weight. In table 2
    below, the BMI are shown for the mothers of the infants in the study. The BMI is a
    measure for the weight of the women and the BMI of the mothers are before
    pregnancy.
15
    Table 2
                                  Mothers to infants fed       Mothers of infants breast
                                  with formula                 fed
      BMI<25                      46%                          65%
      BMI 25-30                   23%                          25%
      BMI >30                     31%                          10%
    Thus, almost half of the women in the study had a normal weight (BMI < 25) and
    the other half women were either overweight or obese.
20
    The infants in both the test group and the control group were fed with a
    conventional infant formula, control formula,      up to the age of three months
    having a protein content of about 2.15 g/100 kcal.
25 After the age of three months the test group were fed with the test formula and
    the control group continued being fed with the control formula. After the age of 6
    months the infants were fed with the infant formulas, control formula and test
    formula, but also with solid foods.

   WO 2015/078505                                                  PCT/EP2013/075050
                                           27
    The infants in the test group, the control group and the group of infants breast fed
    were evaluated at 6 months from birth and at 12 months from birth. Their body
    weight, length, head circumference, and abdominal skinfold were measured.
    Besides, a blood sample was taken and IGF-1 measured.
 5
    The study showed that the infants fed with the test formula (protein content 1.61
    g/100 kcal) had a lower weight gain from 3 to 6 months than infants fed with the
    control formula (protein content 2.15 g/100 kcal).
    For example, the difference in the weight gain between the test group and the
10 control group was calculated to be -0.71 g/day, calculated as [average weight
    gain of test group per day from 3 to 6 months] minus [average weight gain of
    control group per day from 3 to 6 months]. This clearly shows that an infant fed
    with a low amount of protein compared to a higher amount of protein will have a
    lower weight gain, almost 1 gram per day (-0.71 g/day) lower.
15
    The results also showed that the difference in the weight gain between the test
    group and the control group from 3 to 12 months were -231g (or -0.80 g/day).
    The study very surprisingly also showed that the differences in weight gain of
20 infants from 3 to 6 months and from 3 to 12 months between the test group and
    control group were higher the lower the BMI of the infant's mother were, i.e.
    infants from normal weight mothers (BMI < 25) had a higher difference in weight
    gain between control group and test group than infant of obese mothers.
    For example, between 3 and 6 months the weight gain is -1.27 g/day for infants
25 born to mothers having a BMI lower than 25, whereas it is -0.45 g/day for those
    born to mothers being overweight or obese (BMI equals or higher than 25).
    In table 3 below, the differences in weight gain between the test group and the
    control group in relation to the BMI of the infant's mothers are shown. It was very
30 surprising to the inventors of the present invention to see this decrease in weight
    gain of infants in the test group compared to infants in the control group in
    relation to a decrease in BMI of the infant's mother.

   The study also very surprisingly showed that the IGF-1 level in infants fed with
   the test formula was lower than the IGF-1 levels in infants fed with control infant
 5 formula both when the infant was 6 months and 12 months. The IGF-1 level of
   infants in the study is shown below in table 4.

   IGF-1 at 6 months                          -11.03%

   the test group than in the control group, both when the infant is 6 months and 12

  months. Thus, the data clearly shows that infants fed with an infant formula
  comprising 1.61 g/100 kcal protein has a lower IGF-1 level than infants fed with
  an infant formula comprising from 2.15 g/100 kcal protein. Further, table 4 shows
  that the IGF-1 level in infants fed with an infant formula comprising a low amount
5 of protein (1.61 g/100 kcal) is closer to that of breast fed infants than the IGF-1
  level in infants fed with an infant formula comprising a higher amount of protein
  (2.15 g/100 kcal). Thus, the hormonal profile of infants in the test group is closer
  to that of breast fed infants than for the infants in the control group.
