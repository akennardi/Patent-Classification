   TECHNICAL FIELD
   This invention is in the field of non-viral delivery of RNA to animals.
10 BACKGROUND ART
   The delivery of nucleic acids for in vivo expression of encoded proteins is useful for both gene
   therapy and immunisation. Various approaches to successful delivery have been tested, including the
   use of DNA or RNA, of viral or non-viral delivery vehicles (or even no delivery vehicle, in a
   "naked" vaccine), of replicating or non-replicating vectors, or of viral or non-viral vectors.
15 There remains a need for further and improved ways of delivering nucleic acids to animals for in vivo
   expression of their encoded proteins.
   DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION
   According to the invention, RNA is delivered encapsulated within a liposome. The RNA encodes a
   polypeptide of interest. The liposome includes at least one compound selected from the group
20 consisting of compounds of formula (I) and formula (XI). These liposomes can efficiently deliver
   RNA for in vivo expression. The invention is particularly useful for immunisation, in which the
   encoded polypeptide is an immunogen.
   Thus the invention provides a liposome within which RNA encoding a polypeptide of interest is
   encapsulated, wherein the liposome includes at least one compound selected from the group
25 consisting of compounds of formula (I) and formula (XI).
   Formula (I) is:
                                           R1
                               R2 -N                   b     X-      Y1
                                                       CX2        -L       _y2
   wherein:

                     La     is   optionally   substituted     CI 15alkylene,    CI 15alkenylene,     CI1 5alkynylene,

           Ci1 5heteroalkylene, C1 5heteroalkenylene or CI1 5heteroalkynylene;
                     d is0 or 1;
                     e is 0 or 1; and

   Formula (XI) is:
                                                       Ra-(AA)z-Rb

           Rb is -H or -NH 2.
   The invention also provides a process for preparing a RNA-containing liposome, comprising a step
30 of mixing RNA with a compound selected from the group consisting of compounds of formula (I)
   and formula (XI), under conditions such that the compounds form a liposome in which the RNA is
   encapsulated. The RNA and the compound may be mixed in the presence of other compounds which
   also become incorporated into the liposome e.g. further lipids.
                                                             -3-

   The liposome
   The invention utilises liposomes within which polypeptide-encoding RNA is encapsulated. Thus the
   RNA is (as in a natural virus) separated from any external medium. Encapsulation within the
   liposome has been found to protect RNA from RNase digestion. The liposomes can include some
 5 external RNA (e.g. on their surface), but at least half of the RNA (and ideally all of it) is
   encapsulated in the liposome's core. Encapsulation within liposomes is distinct from, for instance,
   the lipid/RNA complexes disclosed in reference 1, where RNA is mixed with pre-formed liposomes.
   Various amphiphilic lipids can form bilayers in an aqueous environment to encapsulate a RNA
   containing aqueous core as a liposome. These lipids can have an anionic, cationic or zwitterionic
10 hydrophilic head group. Formation of liposomes from anionic phospholipids dates back to the 1960s,
   and cationic liposome-forming lipids have been studied since the 1990s. Some phospholipids are
   anionic whereas other are zwitterionic and others are cationic. Suitable classes of phospholipid
   include,     but    are    not    limited    to,  phosphatidylethanolamines,       phosphatidylcholines,
   phosphatidylserines, and phosphatidyl-glycerols, and some useful phospholipids are listed in Table 1.
15 Useful cationic lipids in the prior art include, but are not limited to, dioleoyl trimethylammonium
   propane     (DOTAP),     1,2-distearyloxy-N,N-dimethyl-3-aminopropane       (DSDMA),      1,2-dioleyloxy
   N,Ndimethyl-3-aminopropane            (DODMA),          1,2-dilinoleyloxy-N,N-dimethyl-3-aminopropane
   (DlinDMA), 1,2-dilinolenyloxy-N,N-dimethyl-3-aminopropane              (DLenDMA). Zwitterionic lipids
   include, but are not limited to, acyl zwitterionic lipids and ether zwitterionic lipids. Examples of
20 useful zwitterionic lipids are DPPC, DOPC, DSPC, dodecylphosphocholine, 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero
   3-phosphatidylethanolamine        (DOPE),     and   1,2-diphytanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine
   (DPyPE). The lipids in the liposomes of the invention can be saturated or unsaturated. The use of at
   least one unsaturated lipid for preparing liposomes is preferred. If an unsaturated lipid has two tails,
   both tails can be unsaturated, or it can have one saturated tail and one unsaturated tail. A lipid can
25 include a steroid group in one tail e.g. as in RV05.
   Liposomes of the invention can be formed from a single lipid or, more usually, from a mixture of
   lipids. A mixture may comprise (i) a mixture of cationic lipids (ii) a mixture of anionic lipids and
   cationic lipids (iii) a mixture of zwitterionic lipids and cationic lipids or (vii) a mixture of anionic
   lipids, cationic lipids and zwitterionic lipids. Similarly, a mixture may comprise both saturated and
30 unsaturated lipids. Where a mixture of lipids is used, not all of the component lipids in the mixture
   need to be amphiphilic e.g. one or more amphiphilic lipids can be mixed with cholesterol.
   Liposomes of the invention comprise at least one compound of formula (I) and/or at least one
   compound of formula (XI). Preferred liposomes of the invention include a cationic lipid of formula
   (I). As shown in the examples, such liposomes are particularly useful for in vivo delivery of RNA for
35 protein expression. Other preferred liposomes of the invention include a lipopeptide of formula (XI).
   A liposome can include both a liposome of formula (I) and a lipopeptide of formula (XI), but usually
   includes only one of these two classes of cationic compound.
                                                       -4-

   Where a liposome of the invention is formed from a mixture of lipids, it is preferred that the
   proportion of those lipids which have formula (I) or (XI) should be between 20-80% of the total
   amount of lipids e.g. between 30-70%, or between 40-60%. For instance, useful liposomes are shown
   below in which 40% or 60% of the total lipid is a lipid of formula (I). The remainder can be made of
 5 e.g. cholesterol (e.g. 35-50% cholesterol) and/or DMG (optionally PEGylated) and/or DSPC. Such
   mixtures are used below. These percentage values are mole percentages.
   A liposome may include an amphiphilic lipid whose hydrophilic portion is PEGylated (i.e. modified
   by covalent attachment of a polyethylene glycol). This modification can increase stability and
   prevent non-specific adsorption of the liposomes. For instance, lipids can be conjugated to PEG
10 using techniques such as those disclosed in reference 2 and 3. Useful PEGylated lipids include PEG
   DMG and the lipids of reference 8's formula (XI). PEG provides the liposomes with a coat which
   can confer favourable pharmacokinetic characteristics. Various lengths of PEG can be used e.g.
   between 0.5-8kDa.
   Useful mixtures of lipids, for forming liposomes of the invention, comprise: a cationic lipid of
15 formula (I); cholesterol; and a PEGylated lipid, such as PEG-DMG i.e. PEG-conjugated 1,2
   dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-[methoxy(polyethylene glycol). This mixture may
   also   include   a neutral    zwitterionic lipid,   such as     DSPC    (1,2-Diastearoyl-sn-glycero-3
   phosphocholine) or DPyPE. These (and other) mixtures are used in the examples below.
   Liposomes are usually divided into three groups: multilamellar vesicles (MLV); small unilamellar
20 vesicles (SUV); and large unilamellar vesicles (LUV). MLVs have multiple bilayers in each vesicle,
   forming several separate aqueous compartments. SUVs and LUVs have a single bilayer
   encapsulating an aqueous core; SUVs typically have a diameter <50nm, and LUVs have a diameter
   >50nm. Liposomes of the invention are ideally LUVs with a diameter in the range of 60-180nm, and
   preferably in the range of 80-160nm.
25 A liposome of the invention can be part of a composition comprising a plurality of liposomes, and
   the liposomes within the plurality can have a range of diameters. For a composition comprising a
   population of liposomes with different diameters: (i) at least 80% by number of the liposomes should
   have diameters in the range of 60-180nm, and preferably in the range of 80-160nm, and/or (ii) the
   average diameter (by intensity e.g. Z-average) of the population is ideally in the range of 60-180nm,
30 and preferably in the range of 80-160nm. The diameters within the plurality should ideally have a
   polydispersity index <0.2. The liposome/RNA complexes of reference 1 are expected to have a
   diameter in the range of 600-800nm and to have a high polydispersity. Diameters in a population can
   be measured using dynamic light scattering.
   Techniques for preparing suitable liposomes are well known in the art e.g. see references 4 to 6. One
35 useful method is described in reference 7 and involves mixing (i) an ethanolic solution of the lipids
                                                     -5-

   (ii) an aqueous solution of the nucleic acid and (iii) buffer, followed by mixing, equilibration,
   dilution and purification. Preferred liposomes of the invention are obtainable by this mixing process.
   To obtain liposomes with the desired diameter(s), mixing can be performed using a process in which
   two feed streams of aqueous RNA solution are combined in a single mixing zone with one stream of
 5 an ethanolic lipid solution, all at the same flow rate e.g. in a microfluidic channel as described below.

 5 pKa
   The pKa of a lipid is the pH at which 50% of the lipids are charged, lying halfway between the point
   where the lipids are completely charged and the point where the lipids are completely uncharged. It
   can be measured in various ways, but is preferably measured using the method disclosed below. The
   pKa typically should be measured for the lipid alone rather than for the lipid in the context of a
10 mixture which also includes other lipids (e.g. not as performed in reference 2, which looks at the pKa
   of a SNALP rather than of the individual lipids).
   The pKa of a lipid is measured in water at standard temperature and pressure using the following
   technique:
       *    2mM solution of lipid in ethanol is prepared by weighing the lipid and dissolving in ethanol.
15          0.3mM solution of fluorescent probe toluene nitrosulphonic acid (TNS) in ethanol:methanol
            9:1 is prepared by first making 3mM solution of TNS in methanol and then diluting to
            0.3mM with ethanol.
       "    An aqueous buffer containing sodium phosphate, sodium citrate sodium acetate and sodium
            chloride, at the concentrations 20mM, 25mM, 20mM and 150 mM, respectively, is prepared.
20          The buffer is split into eight parts and the pH adjusted either with 12N HCl or 6N NaOH to
            4.44-4.52, 5.27, 6.15-6.21, 6.57, 7.10-7.20, 7.72-7.80, 8.27-8.33 and 10.47-11.12. 400uL of
            2mM lipid solution and 800uL of 0.3mM TNS solution are mixed.
       *    7.5pL of probe/lipid mix are added to 242.5 jL of buffer in a 1mL 96 well plate. This is done
            with all eight buffers. After mixing, 1OOuL of each probe/lipid/buffer mixture is transferred
25          to a 250uL black with clear bottom 96 well plate (e.g. model COSTAR 3904, Coming).
       "    Fluorescence of each probe/lipid/buffer mixture is measured (e.g. with a SpectraMax M5
            spectrophotometer and SoftMax pro 5.2 software) with 322nm excitation, 431nm emission
            (auto cutoff at 420nm).
       "    After the measurement, the background fluorescence value of an empty well on the 96 well
30          plate is subtracted from each probe/lipid/buffer mixture. The fluorescence intensity values
            are then normalized to the value at lowest pH. The normalized fluorescence intensity is then
            plotted against pH and a line of best fit is provided.
                                                        -21-

        *  The point on the line of best fit at which the normalized fluorescence intensity is equal to 0.5
           is found. The pH corresponding to normalized fluorescence intensity equal to 0.5 is found
           and is considered the pKa of the lipid.
   The best immunological results are seen with lipids having a pKa in the range of 5.0 to 7.6. Within
 5 this pKa range, preferred lipids have a pKa of 5.5 to 6.7 e.g. between 5.6 and 6.8, between 5.6 and
   6.3, between 5.6 and 6.0, between 5.5 and 6.2, or between 5.7 and 5.9.

   The Ra moiety has formula R'-C(O)-NRd- where R' is an C2 to C 24 alkyl and Rd is -H or C1 to C 4
   alkyl. Suitable Re groups include lauryl ('Lau'; C 12 ) and palmitoyl ('Pal'; C 16 ).
   The amide of the Ra moiety is attached to an oligopeptide chain of from 2 to 10 amino acids e.g. from
30 3-8 amino acids. This chain includes at least one (e.g. 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5) histidine. It also includes at least
   one cationic amino acid e.g. at least one arginine, lysine or ornithine residue. The inclusion of at least
   one lysine is preferred, and ideally 2 or 3 lysines. Histidine is included because its side chain is
   weakly basic and predominantly un-ionized at physiological pH, but is more highly protonated in the

   weakly acidic environment of the endosome. A cationic amino acid, such as lysine or arginine,
   provides a unit positive charge on the lipopeptide at neutral pH. Useful oligopeptides have amino
   acid sequence -C-Ki-Hj- where: i is 1, 2 or 3; and j is 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5.
   The C-terminus of the oligopeptide chain can be left as -COOH or can instead form an amide.
 5 Compounds of formula (XI) can be described in terms of their alkyl chain, their amino acid
   sequence, and their C-terminal group. For instance, the lipopeptide "Lau-(C-K-H-H)-NH 2" has a
   N-terminus lauryl chain, then a cysteine, then lysine, then two histidines, and a C-terminus amine.
   Suitable lipopeptides of formula (XI) thus include, but are not limited to: Lau-(C-K-K-H)-NH 2, Pal
   (C-K-H-H)-NH 2, Pal-(C-K-K-H-H)-NH 2, Pal-(C-K-K-H-H-H)-NH 2, Pal-(C-K-K-H-H-H-H)-NH 2,

   The RNA
15 Liposomes of the invention include a RNA molecule which (unlike siRNA, as in reference 2)
   encodes a polypeptide. After in vivo administration of the particles, RNA is released from the
   particles and is translated inside a cell to provide the polypeptide in situ.
   The RNA is +-stranded, and so it can be translated by cells without needing any intervening
   replication steps such as reverse transcription. It can also bind to TLR7 receptors expressed by
20 immune cells, thereby initiating an adjuvant effect which is useful for immunisation purposes.
                                                       -23-

   Preferred +-stranded RNAs are self-replicating. A self-replicating RNA molecule (replicon) can,
   when delivered to a vertebrate cell even without any proteins, lead to the production of multiple
   daughter RNAs by transcription from itself (via an antisense copy which it generates from itself). A
   self-replicating RNA molecule is thus typically a +-strand molecule which can be directly translated
 5 after delivery to a cell, and this translation provides a RNA-dependent RNA polymerase which then
   produces both antisense and sense transcripts from the delivered RNA. Thus the delivered RNA
   leads to the production of multiple daughter RNAs. These daughter RNAs, as well as collinear
   subgenomic transcripts, may be translated themselves to provide in situ expression of an encoded
   polypeptide of interest, or may be transcribed to provide further transcripts with the same sense as
10 the delivered RNA which are translated to provide in situ expression of the polypeptide of interest.
   The overall result of this sequence of transcriptions is a huge amplification of the introduced replicon
   RNAs and so the encoded polypeptide of interest becomes a major product of the cells.
   One suitable system for achieving self-replication is to use an alphavirus-based RNA replicon. These
   +-stranded replicons are translated after delivery to a cell to give of a replicase (or replicase
15 transcriptase). The replicase is translated as a polyprotein which auto-cleaves to provide a replication
   complex which creates genomic -- strand copies of the +-strand delivered RNA. These -- strand
   transcripts can themselves be transcribed to give further copies of the +-stranded parent RNA and
   also to give a subgenomic transcript which encodes the polypeptide of interest. Translation of the
   subgenomic transcript thus leads to in situ expression of the polypeptide by the infected cell. Suitable
20 alphavirus replicons can use a replicase from a sindbis virus, a semliki forest virus, an eastern equine
   encephalitis virus, a venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, etc. Mutant or wild-type viruses sequences
   can be used e.g. the attenuated TC83 mutant of VEEV has been used in replicons [10].
   A preferred self-replicating RNA molecule thus encodes (i) a RNA-dependent RNA polymerase
   which can transcribe RNA from the self-replicating RNA molecule and (ii) a polypeptide of interest.
25 The polymerase can be an alphavirus replicase e.g. comprising one or more of alphavirus proteins
   nsP1, nsP2, nsP3 and nsP4.
   Whereas     natural alphavirus    genomes encode structural      virion proteins in addition to the
   non-structural replicase polyprotein, it is preferred that a self-replicating RNA molecule of the
   invention does not encode alphavirus structural proteins. Thus a preferred self-replicating RNA can
30 lead to the production of genomic RNA copies of itself in a cell, but not to the production of RNA
   containing virions. The inability to produce these virions means that, unlike a wild-type alphavirus,
   the self-replicating RNA molecule cannot perpetuate itself in infectious form. The alphavirus
   structural proteins which are necessary for perpetuation in wild-type viruses are absent from
   self-replicating RNAs of the invention and their place is taken by gene(s) encoding the polypeptide
35 of interest, such that the subgenomic transcript encodes that polypeptide rather than the structural
   alphavirus virion proteins.
                                                       -24-

   Thus a self-replicating RNA molecule useful with the invention may have two open reading frames.
   The first (5') open reading frame encodes a replicase; the second (3') open reading frame encodes a
   polypeptide of interest. In some embodiments the RNA may have additional (e.g. downstream) open
   reading frames e.g. to encode further polypeptides of interest (see below) or to encode accessory
 5 polypeptides.
   A self-replicating RNA molecule can have a 5' sequence which is compatible with the encoded
   replicase.
   Self-replicating RNA molecules can have various lengths but they are typically 5000-25000
   nucleotides long e.g. 8000-15000 nucleotides, or 9000-12000 nucleotides. Thus the RNA is longer
10 than seen in siRNA delivery.
   A RNA molecule useful with the invention may have a 5' cap (e.g. a 7-methylguanosine). This cap
   can enhance in vivo translation of the RNA.
   The 5' nucleotide of a RNA molecule useful with the invention may have a 5' triphosphate group. In
   a capped RNA this may be linked to a 7-methylguanosine via a 5'-to-5' bridge. A 5' triphosphate can
15 enhance RIG-I binding and thus promote adjuvant effects.
   A RNA molecule may have a 3' poly-A tail. It may also include a poly-A polymerase recognition
   sequence (e.g. AAUAAA) near its 3' end.
   A RNA molecule useful with the invention will typically be single-stranded. Single-stranded RNAs
   can generally initiate an adjuvant effect by binding to TLR7, TLR8, RNA helicases and/or PKR.
20 RNA delivered in double-stranded form (dsRNA) can bind to TLR3, and this receptor can also be
   triggered by dsRNA which is formed either during replication of a single-stranded RNA or within the
   secondary structure of a single-stranded RNA.
   A RNA molecule useful with the invention can conveniently be prepared by in vitro transcription
   (IVT). IVT can use a (cDNA) template created and propagated in plasmid form in bacteria, or
25 created synthetically (for example by gene synthesis and/or polymerase chain-reaction (PCR)
   engineering methods). For instance, a DNA-dependent RNA polymerase (such as the bacteriophage
   T7, T3 or SP6 RNA polymerases) can be used to transcribe the RNA from a DNA template.
   Appropriate capping and poly-A addition reactions can be used as required (although the replicon's
   poly-A is usually encoded within the DNA template). These RNA polymerases can have stringent
30 requirements for the transcribed 5' nucleotide(s) and in some embodiments these requirements must
   be matched with the requirements of the encoded replicase, to ensure that the IVT-transcribed RNA
   can function efficiently as a substrate for its self-encoded replicase.
   As discussed in reference 11, the self-replicating RNA can include (in addition to any 5' cap
   structure) one or more nucleotides having a modified nucleobase. Thus the RNA can comprise m5C
                                                        -25-

10 can include one or more modified pyrimidine nucleobases,              such as pseudouridine      and/or
   5-methylcytosine residues. In some embodiments, however, the RNA includes no modified
   nucleobases, and may include no modified nucleotides i.e. all of the nucleotides in the RNA are
   standard A, C, G and U ribonucleotides (except for any 5' cap structure, which may include a
   7'-methylguanosine). In other embodiments, the RNA may include a 5' cap comprising a
15 7'-methylguanosine, and the first 1, 2 or 3 5' ribonucleotides may be methylated at the 2' position of
   the ribose.
   A RNA used with the invention ideally includes only phosphodiester linkages between nucleosides,
   but    in   some   embodiments     it  can   contain   phosphoramidate,      phosphorothioate,   and/or
   methylphosphonate linkages.
20 Ideally, a liposome includes fewer than 10 different species of RNA e.g. 5, 4, 3, or 2 different
   species; most preferably, a liposome includes a single RNA species i.e. all RNA molecules in the
   liposome have the same sequence and same length.
   The amount of RNA per liposome can vary. The number of individual self-replicating RNA
   molecules per liposome is typically <50 e.g. <20, <10, <5, or 1-4 per liposome.
25 The encoded polypeptide of interest
   RNA molecules used with the invention encode a polypeptide of interest. After administration of the
   liposomes the RNA is translated in vivo and the resulting protein can exert its desired effect e.g. it
   can elicit an immune response in the recipient, or it can provide a function of interest, such as an
   enzymatic activity.
30 The RNA molecule can encode a single polypeptide of interest or multiple polypeptides. Multiple
   polypeptides can be presented as a single polypeptide (fusion polypeptide) or as separate
   polypeptides. If polypeptides are expressed as separate polypeptides from a replicon then one or
   more of these may be provided with an upstream IRES or an additional viral promoter element.
   Alternatively, multiple polypeptides may be expressed from a polyprotein that encodes individual
35 polypeptide fused to a short autocatalytic protease (e.g. foot-and-mouth disease virus 2A protein), or
   as inteins.
                                                     -27-

   Unlike references 1 and 12, the RNA encodes a polypeptide with a useful in vivo function. For the
   avoidance of doubt, the invention does not encompass RNA which encodes a firefly luciferase or
   which encodes a fusion protein of E.coli P-galactosidase or which encodes a green fluorescent
   protein (GFP). Such polypeptides may be useful as markers but the invention concerns delivery of
 5 RNA for in vivo expression of a polypeptide which can provide a useful therapeutic or
   immunological response. Also, the RNA is not total mouse thymus RNA.
   Immunogens
   In some embodiments the RNA encodes a polypeptide immunogen. After administration of the
   liposomes the RNA is translated in vivo and the immunogen can elicit an immune response in the
10 recipient. The immunogen may elicit an immune response against a bacterium, a virus, a fungus or a
   parasite (or, in some embodiments, against an allergen; and in other embodiments, against a tumor
   antigen). The immune response may comprise an antibody response (usually including IgG) and/or a
   cell-mediated immune response. The polypeptide immunogen will typically elicit an immune
   response which recognises the corresponding bacterial, viral, fungal or parasite (or allergen or
15 tumour) polypeptide, but in some embodiments the polypeptide may act as a mimotope to elicit an
   immune response which recognises a bacterial, viral, fungal or parasite saccharide. The immunogen
   will typically be a surface polypeptide e.g. an adhesin, a hemagglutinin, an envelope glycoprotein, a
   spike glycoprotein, etc.
   In some embodiments the immunogen elicits an immune response against one of these bacteria:
20    Neisseria meningitidis: useful immunogens include, but are not limited to, membrane proteins
          such as adhesins, autotransporters, toxins, iron acquisition proteins, and factor H binding
          protein. A combination of three useful polypeptides is disclosed in reference 13.

20 Injectables for intramuscular administration are typical.
   Compositions comprise an immunologically effective amount of liposomes, as well as any other
   components, as needed. By 'immunologically effective amount', it is meant that the administration of
   that amount to an individual, either in a single dose or as part of a series, is effective for treatment or
   prevention. This amount varies depending upon the health and physical condition of the individual to
25 be treated, age, the taxonomic group of individual to be treated (e.g. non-human primate, primate,
   etc.), the capacity of the individual's immune system to synthesise antibodies, the degree of
   protection desired, the formulation of the vaccine, the treating doctor's assessment of the medical
   situation, and other relevant factors. It is expected that the amount will fall in a relatively broad range
   that can be determined through routine trials. The liposome and RNA content of compositions of the
30 invention will generally be expressed in terms of the amount of RNA per dose. A preferred dose has
   <100gg RNA (e.g. from 10-100gg, such as about lOgg, 25gg, 50pg, 75gg or 100gg), but expression
   can be seen at much lower levels e.g. <1gg/dose, <100ng/dose, <10ng/dose, <ing/dose, etc

   The invention also provides a delivery device (e.g. syringe, nebuliser, sprayer, inhaler, dermal patch,
   etc.) containing a pharmaceutical composition of the invention. This device can be used to administer
   the composition to a vertebrate subject.
   Liposomes of the invention do not contain ribosomes.
 5 Methods of treatment and medical uses
   In contrast to the particles disclosed in reference 12, liposomes and pharmaceutical compositions of
   the invention are for in vivo use for eliciting an immune response against an immunogen of interest,
   or for gene therapy.
   The invention provides a method for raising an immune response in a vertebrate comprising the step
10 of administering an effective amount of a liposome or pharmaceutical composition of the invention.
   The immune response is preferably protective and preferably involves antibodies and/or cell
   mediated immunity. The method may raise a booster response.
   The invention also provides a liposome or pharmaceutical composition of the invention for use in a
   method for raising an immune response in a vertebrate.
15 The invention also provides a liposome or pharmaceutical composition of the invention for use in a
   method of gene therapy in a vertebrate.
   The invention also provides the use of a liposome of the invention in the manufacture of a
   medicament for raising an immune response in a vertebrate.
   By raising an immune response in the vertebrate by these uses and methods, the vertebrate can be
20 protected against various diseases and/or infections e.g. against bacterial and/or viral diseases as
   discussed above. The liposomes and compositions are immunogenic, and are more preferably
   vaccine compositions. Vaccines according to the invention may either be prophylactic (i.e. to prevent
   infection) or therapeutic (i.e. to treat infection), but will typically be prophylactic.
   The vertebrate is preferably a mammal, such as a human or a large veterinary mammal (e.g. horses,
25 cattle, deer, goats, pigs). Where the vaccine is for prophylactic use, the human is preferably a child
   (e.g. a toddler or infant) or a teenager; where the vaccine is for therapeutic use, the human is
   preferably a teenager or an adult. A vaccine intended for children may also be administered to adults
   e.g. to assess safety, dosage, immunogenicity, etc.
   Vaccines prepared according to the invention may be used to treat both children and adults. Thus a
30 human patient may be less than 1 year old, less than 5 years old, 1-5 years old, 5-15 years old, 15-55
   years old, or at least 55 years old. Preferred patients for receiving the vaccines are the elderly (e.g.
   >50 years old, >60 years old, and preferably >65 years), the young (e.g. <5 years old), hospitalised
   patients, healthcare workers, armed service and military personnel, pregnant women, the chronically
                                                         -37-

   ill, or immunodeficient patients. The vaccines are not suitable solely for these groups, however, and
   may be used more generally in a population.
   Compositions of the invention will generally be administered directly to a patient. Direct delivery
   may be accomplished by parenteral injection (e.g. subcutaneously, intraperitoneally, intravenously,
 5 intramuscularly, intradermally, or to the interstitial space of a tissue; unlike reference 1, intraglossal
   injection is not typically used with the present invention). Alternative delivery routes include rectal,
   oral (e.g. tablet, spray), buccal, sublingual, vaginal, topical, transdermal or transcutaneous, intranasal,
   ocular, aural, pulmonary        or other    mucosal administration.      Intradermal   and intramuscular
   administration are two preferred routes. Injection may be via a needle (e.g. a hypodermic needle), but
10 needle-free injection may alternatively be used. A typical intramuscular dose is 0.5 ml.
   The invention may be used to elicit systemic and/or mucosal immunity, preferably to elicit an
   enhanced systemic and/or mucosal immunity.
   Dosage can be by a single dose schedule or a multiple dose schedule. Multiple doses may be used in
   a primary immunisation schedule and/or in a booster immunisation schedule. In a multiple dose
15 schedule the various doses may be given by the same or different routes e.g. a parenteral prime and
   mucosal boost, a mucosal prime and parenteral boost, etc. Multiple doses will typically be
   administered at least 1 week apart (e.g. about 2 weeks, about 3 weeks, about 4 weeks, about 6 weeks,
   about 8 weeks, about 10 weeks, about 12 weeks, about 16 weeks, etc.). In one embodiment, multiple
   doses may be administered approximately 6 weeks, 10 weeks and 14 weeks after birth, e.g. at an age
20 of 6 weeks, 10 weeks and 14 weeks, as often used in the World Health Organisation's Expanded
   Program on Immunisation ("EPI"). In an alternative embodiment, two primary doses are
   administered about two months apart, e.g. about 7, 8 or 9 weeks apart, followed by one or more
   booster doses about 6 months to 1 year after the second primary dose, e.g. about 6, 8, 10 or 12
   months after the second primary dose. In a further embodiment, three primary doses are administered
25 about two months apart, e.g. about 7, 8 or 9 weeks apart, followed by one or more booster doses
   about 6 months to 1 year after the third primary dose, e.g. about 6, 8, 10, or 12 months after the third
   primary dose.

   q is independently 0, 1 or 2. In one embodiment, q is 0.
   r is independently 0 or 1. In one embodiment, r is 0.
   Where reference is made to a carbon atom being replaced by Si, what is intended is that the carbon
   atom is swapped for a silicon atom but that the bonds otherwise remain the same. Thus, for example,
10 -CH 2- is replaced by -SiH 2-; -CH= is replaced by -SiH=; and BC-H is replaced by =Si-H.
   By way of clarification, in relation to the above mentioned heteroatom containing groups (such as
   heteroalkyl etc.), where a numerical of carbon atoms is given, for instance C 3.6heteroalkyl, what is
   intended is a group based on C 3 .6 alkyl in which one or more of the 3-6 chain carbon atoms is
   replaced by 0, S(O)q or N. Accordingly, a C3.6heteroalkyl group would, for example, contain less
15 than 3-6 chain carbon atoms.           As another example, a pyridyl group would be classed as a C6
   heteroaryl group even though it contains 5 carbon atoms.
   Substitution
   Groups of the compounds of the invention (e.g. alkyl, cycloalkyl, alkoxy, alkenyl, cycloalkenyl,
   alkynyl, alkylene, alkenylene, heteroalkyl, heterocycloalkyl, heteroalkenyl, heterocycloalkenyl,
20 heteroalkynyl,     heteroalkylene,      heteroalkenylene    aryl, arylalkyl, arylheteroalkyl, heteroaryl,
   heteroarylalkyl or heteroarylheteroalkyl groups etc.) may be substituted or unsubstituted, in one
   embodiment unsubstituted. Typically, substitution involves the notional replacement of a hydrogen
   atom with a substituent group, or two hydrogen atoms in the case of substitution by =0.
   Where substituted, there will generally be 1 to 5 substituents on each group, in one embodiment 1 to
25 3 substituents, in one embodiment 1 or 2 substituents, in one embodiment 1 substituent. One
   embodiment includes more than one substituent on the same atom, e.g. an acetal group.
   In one embodiment, the substituent(s) is/are independently Sub' or Sub2 (in one embodiment Sub 2 )

20 While Rs in Sub' can be optionally substituted by 1 to 3 substituents Sub2 , Sub2 is unsubstituted.
   However, in one embodiment, RS is unsubstituted.
   In one embodiment, RS is H or C1.6 alkyl, optionally substituted by 1 to 3 substituents Sub 2
   In one embodiment, Sub 2 is independently halogen, trihalomethyl, trihaloethyl, -NO 2, -CN,

   Z t -C3-6cycloalkyl.
   In one embodiment, where the substituted group is acyclic (e.g. alkyl, heteroalkyl, alkenyl etc.), Sub'
   is not -Rs and Sub 2 is not -Ci-6 alkyl, -Ci-6 heteroalkyl, -C 2-6 alkenyl, -C2-6heteroalkenyl, -C 2-6alkynyl or
   -C 2-6heteroalkynyl.
30 Where a group other than Sub 2 has at least 2 positions which may be substituted, the group may be
   substituted by both ends of an alkylene, alkenylene, alkynylene, heteroalkylene, heteroalkenylene or
   heteroalkynylene chain (in one embodiment containing 1 to 6 atoms, in a further embodiment 3 to 6
   atoms, and in a further embodiment 3 or 4 atoms) to form a cyclic moiety. That chain is optionally
                                                                -45-

   substituted by 1 to 3 substituents Sub 2 . In one embodiment that chain is not substituted. Thus, the
   terms optionally substituted "cycloalkyl", "cycloalkenyl", "cycloalkynyl", "heterocycloalkyl",
   "heterocycloalkenyl", "heterocycloalkynyl", "aryl" and "heteroaryl" include fused species. E.g.
   "optionally substituted cycloalkyl" includes a species in which two cycloalkyl rings are fused, and
 5 "optionally substituted heteroaryl" includes a species in which a heterocycloalkyl ring is fused to the
   aromatic ring (e.g. 5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-1,8-naphthyridin-2-yl).
   Where a group other than Sub 2 has an atom which may be substituted twice, that atom may be
   substituted by both ends of an alkylene, alkenylene, alkynylene, heteroalkylene, heteroalkenylene or
   heteroalkynylene chain (in one embodiment containing 2 to 8 atoms, in a further embodiment 3 to 6
10 atoms, and in a further embodiment 4 or 5 atoms) to form a cyclic moiety. That chain is optionally
   substituted by 1 to 3 substituents Sub 2 . In one embodiment that chain is not substituted. Thus, the
   terms optionally substituted "cycloalkyl", "cycloalkenyl", "cycloalkynyl", "heterocycloalkyl",
   "heterocycloalkenyl", "heterocycloalkynyl", "aryl" and "heteroaryl" include spiro species.
   By way of clarification, when a group has a heteroatom, a substituent may be bonded to the
15 heteroatom. Thus, for example, "optionally substituted heteroalkyl" includes -CH 2-N(Subl)-CH 2-,
   -CH(Sub )-NH-CH2- and -CH(Sub )-N(Sub l)-CH 2- etc.
   Modifier terms
   When a list is preceded by a modifier, it is intended that the modifier is to be understood as applying
   to each     of the items       in the    list.   For   example, the phrase "optionally       substituted
20 C3-20-heterocycloalkyl, C3-20-heterocycloalkenyl, C3-20-heterocycloalkynyl or C5 -20-heteroaryl group"
   means that each of the four items in the list, namely the C 3-20-heterocycloalkyl group, the
   C3-20-heterocycloalkenyl group, the C 3-20-heterocycloalkynyl group and the C6-2o-heteroaryl group,
   may be optionally substituted.
   When a group is characterised by a first modifier and then, later on, the same group is characterised
25 by a subsequent modifier, what is meant is that the group is characterised by both modifiers
   simultaneously.     For example, if a group is described as a "C 3-20-heterocycloalkynyl" (the first
   modifier) group and then later the same group is described as a "C5 -16 " (the subsequent modifier)
   group, what is meant is a C5 -16 heterocycloalkynyl group.
   Steroids
30 As used herein, the term "steroid" refers to any group comprising the following structure (which
   structure is referred to herein as the "steroid skeleton").
                                                       -46-

   Purely for the purposes of illustration, the steroid skeleton has been drawn above as fully saturated.
   The term steroid, however, is also intended to cover instances where there is unsaturation in the
   steroid skeleton. For example, the term steroid covers a group which comprises the fully unsaturated
   (mancude) basic skeleton, 15H-cyclopenta[a]phenanthrene:
                                                             12         17
                                                     11        13               16
                                                 10              4            CH 15
                                                               8
                                                       9
 5                                          4          6
   The term steroid also covers a group which comprises a partially unsaturated steroid skeleton.
   The term steroid also covers "seco" derivatives of the steroid skeleton, i.e. groups in which ring
   cleavage has been effected; "nor" and "homo" derivatives of the steroid skeleton which involve ring
   contraction and expansion, respectively (see Systemic Nomenclature of Organic Chemistry, by D.
10 Hellwinkel, published by Springer, 2001, ISBN: 3-540-41138-0, page 203 for "seco" and page 204
   for "nor" and "homo"). In one embodiment, however, such seco derivatives are not encompassed by
   the term "steroid". In another embodiment, such nor derivatives are not encompassed by the term
   "steroid".   In another embodiment, such homo derivatives are not encompassed by the term
   "steroid".  Thus in one embodiment, such seco, nor and homo derivatives are not encompassed by
15 the term "steroid".
   The term steroid also covers instances where one or more of the carbon atoms in the structure
   labelled steroid skeleton is replaced by a heteroatom. In one such embodiment, up to six carbon
   atoms, in one embodiment up to five carbon atoms, in another embodiment up to four carbon atoms,
   in another embodiment up to three carbon atoms, in another embodiment up to two carbon atoms, in
20 another embodiment one carbon atom, are each replaced independently by 0, S(O)q, N, P(O), or Si
   (and preferably 0, S(O)q or N). In one embodiment, however, the term "steroid" comprises species
   in which the "steroid basic skeleton" contains no heteroatoms.
   A steroid ring system is numbered according to the convention set out below.

    Unsaturation
   In accordance with standard use, the omega-3 position refers to the third bond from the (methyl)

 5 General
   The practice of the present invention will employ, unless otherwise indicated, conventional methods
   of chemistry, biochemistry, molecular biology, immunology and pharmacology, within the skill of
   the art. Such techniques are explained fully in the literature. See, e.g., references 32-38, etc.
   The term "comprising" encompasses "including" as well as "consisting" e.g. a composition
10 "comprising" X may consist exclusively of X or may include something additional e.g. X + Y.
   The term "about" in relation to a numerical value x is optional and means, for example, x+ 10%.
   The word "substantially" does not exclude "completely" e.g. a composition which is "substantially
   free" from Y may be completely free from Y. Where necessary, the word "substantially" may be
   omitted from the definition of the invention.

   MODES FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION
   RNA replicons
   Various replicons are used below. In general these are based on a hybrid alphavirus genome with
15 non-structural proteins from venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV), a packaging signal from
   sindbis virus, and a 3' UTR from Sindbis virus or a VEEV mutant. The replicon is about 10kb long
   and has a poly-A tail.
   Plasmid DNA encoding alphavirus replicons (named: pT7-mVEEV-FL.RSVF or A317; pT7
   mVEEV-SEAP or A306; pSP6-VCR-GFP or A50) served as a template for synthesis of RNA in
20 vitro. The replicons contain the alphavirus genetic elements required for RNA replication but lack
   those encoding gene products necessary for particle assembly; the structural proteins are instead
   replaced by a protein of interest (either a reporter, such as SEAP or GFP, or an immunogen, such as
   full-length RSV F protein) and so the replicons are incapable of inducing the generation of infectious
   particles. A bacteriophage (T7 or SP6) promoter upstream of the alphavirus cDNA facilitates the
25 synthesis of the replicon RNA in vitro and a hepatitis delta virus (HDV) ribozyme immediately
   downstream of the poly(A)-tail generates the correct 3'-end through its self-cleaving activity.
   Following linearization of the plasmid DNA downstream of the HDV ribozyme with a suitable
   restriction endonuclease, run-off transcripts were synthesized in vitro using T7 or SP6 bacteriophage
   derived DNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Transcriptions were performed for 2 hours at 37'C in the
30 presence of 7.5 mM (T7 RNA polymerase) or 5 mM (SP6 RNA polymerase) of each of the
   nucleoside triphosphates (ATP, CTP, GTP and UTP) following the instructions provided by the
   manufacturer (Ambion). Following transcription the template DNA was digested with TURBO
   DNase (Ambion). The replicon RNA was precipitated with LiCl and reconstituted in nuclease-free
   water. Uncapped RNA was capped post-transcriptionally with Vaccinia Capping Enzyme (VCE)
35 using the ScriptCap m7G Capping System (Epicentre Biotechnologies) as outlined in the user
                                                      -50-

   manual; replicons capped in this way are given the "v" prefix e.g. vA317 is the A317 replicon
   capped by VCE. Post-transcriptionally capped RNA was precipitated with LiC1 and reconstituted in
   nuclease-free water. The concentration of the RNA samples was determined by measuring OD 2 60 nm.
   Integrity of the in vitro transcripts was confirmed by denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis.
 5 Encapsulation in DlinDMA-based liposomes
   RNA was encapsulated in liposomes made essentially by the method of references 7 and 40. The
   liposomes were made of 10% DSPC (zwitterionic), 40% DlinDMA (cationic), 48% cholesterol and
   2% PEG-conjugated DMG (2kDa PEG). These proportions refer to the % moles in the total
   liposome.
10 DlinDMA (1,2-dilinoleyloxy-N,N-dimethyl-3-aminopropane)          was synthesized using the procedure
   of reference 2. DSPC (1,2-Diastearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) was purchased from Genzyme.
   Cholesterol was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. PEG-conjugated DMG (1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero
   3-phosphoethanolamine-N-[methoxy(polyethylene glycol), ammonium salt), DOTAP (1,2-dioleoyl
   3-trimethylammonium-propane, chloride salt) and DC-chol (3p-[N-(N',N'-dimethylaminoethane)
15 carbamoyl]cholesterol hydrochloride) were from Avanti Polar Lipids.
   Briefly, lipids were dissolved in ethanol (2ml), a RNA replicon was dissolved in buffer (2ml, 1OOmM
   sodium citrate, pH 6) and these were mixed with 2ml of buffer followed by 1 hour of equilibration.
   The mixture was diluted with 6ml buffer then filtered. The resulting product contained liposomes,
   with ~95% encapsulation efficiency. FIG. 2 shows an example electron micrograph of liposomes
20 prepared by these methods. These liposomes contain encapsulated RNA encoding full-length RSV F
   antigen. Dynamic light scattering of one batch showed an average diameter of 141nm (Zav by
   intensity) or 78nm (by number).
   In one particular encapsulation method, fresh lipid stock solutions in ethanol were prepared. 37 mg
   of DlinDMA, 11.8 mg of DSPC, 27.8 mg of Cholesterol and 8.07 mg of PEG-conjugated DMG were
25 weighed and dissolved in 7.55 mL of ethanol. Three different conjugated PEGs were used:
   PEG-1000, PEG-2000 or PEG-3000. The freshly prepared lipid stock solution was gently rocked at
   37'C for about 15 min to form a homogenous mixture. Then, 226.7 ptL of the stock was added to
   1.773 mL ethanol to make a working lipid stock solution of 2 mL. A 2 mL working solution of RNA
   was also prepared from a stock solution of ~ lpg/pL in 100 mM citrate buffer (pH 6). Three 20 mL
30 glass vials (with stir bars) were rinsed with RNase Away solution and washed with plenty of MilliQ
   water before use to decontaminate the vials of RNAses. One of the vials was used for the RNA
   working solution and the others for collecting the lipid and RNA mixes (as described later). The
   working lipid and RNA solutions were heated at 37'C for 10 min before being loaded into 3cc luer
   lok syringes. 2 mL of citrate buffer (pH 6) was loaded in another 3 cc syringe. Syringes containing
35 RNA and the lipids were connected to a T mixer (PEEK TM 500 pim ID junction) using FEP tubing
   (fluorinated ethylene-propylene; all FEP tubing used had a 2mm internal diameter and a 3mm outer
                                                      -51-

   diameter; obtained from Idex Health Science). The outlet from the T mixer was also FEP tubing. The
   third syringe containing the citrate buffer was connected to a separate piece of tubing. All syringes
   were then driven at a flow rate of 7 mL/min using a syringe pump. The tube outlets were positioned
   to collect the mixtures in a 20 mL glass vial (while stirring). The stir bar was taken out and the
 5 ethanol/aqueous solution was allowed to equilibrate to room temperature for 1 hour. 4 ml of the
   mixture was loaded into a 5 cc syringe, which was connected to a piece of FEP tubing and in another
   5 cc syringe connected to an equal length of FEP tubing, an equal amount of 100 mM citrate buffer
   (pH 6) was loaded. The two syringes were driven at 7mL/min flow rate using the syringe pump and
   the final mixture collected in a 20 mL glass vial (while stirring). Next, the mixture collected from the
10 second mixing step (liposomes) were passed through a Mustang         Q  membrane (an anion-exchange
   support that binds and removes anionic molecules, obtained from Pall Corporation). Before using
   this membrane for the liposomes, 4 mL of 1 M NaOH, 4 mL of 1 M NaCl and 10 mL of 100 mM
   citrate buffer (pH 6) were successively passed through it. Liposomes were warmed for 10 min at
   37 0 C before passing through the membrane. Next, liposomes were concentrated to 2 mL and
15 dialyzed against 10-15 volumes of IX PBS using by tangential flow filtration before recovering the
   final product. The TFF system and hollow fiber filtration membranes were purchased from Spectrum
   Labs (Rancho Dominguez) and were used according to the manufacturer's guidelines. Polysulfone
   hollow fiber filtration membranes with a 100 kD pore size cutoff and 8 cm 2 surface area were used.
   For in vitro and in vivo experiments formulations were diluted to the required RNA concentration
20 with 1X PBS.
   The percentage of encapsulated RNA and RNA concentration were determined by Quant-iT
   RiboGreen RNA reagent kit (Invitrogen), following manufacturer's instructions. The ribosomal RNA
   standard provided in the kit was used to generate a standard curve. Liposomes were diluted 1Ox or
    100x in 1X TE buffer (from kit) before addition of the dye. Separately, liposomes were diluted lOx
25 or 100x in IX TE buffer containing 0.5% Triton X before addition of the dye (to disrupt the
   liposomes and thus to assay total RNA). Thereafter an equal amount of dye was added to each
   solution and then -180 ptL of each solution after dye addition was loaded in duplicate into a 96 well
   tissue culture plate. The fluorescence (Ex 485 nm, Em 528 nm) was read on a microplate reader. All
   liposome formulations were dosed in vivo based on the encapsulated amount of RNA.
30 To obtain smaller liposomes the syringe/tube method was replaced by a method in which the lipid
   and RNA solutions are mixed in channels on a microfluidic chip. Fresh lipid stock solutions in
   ethanol were prepared. 37 mg of DlinDMA, 11.8 mg of DSPC, 27.8 mg of cholesterol and 8.07 mg
   of PEG-DMG were weighed and dissolved in 7.55 mL of ethanol. The freshly prepared lipid stock
   solution was gently rocked at 37 0 C for about 15 min to form a homogenous mixture. Then, 226.7 ptL
35 of the stock was added to 1.773 mL ethanol to make a working lipid stock solution of 2 mL. A 4 mL
   working solution of RNA was also prepared from a stock solution of            I pg/ptL in 100 mM citrate
   buffer (pH 6). Four 20 mL glass vials (with stir bars) were rinsed with RNase Away solution and
                                                     -52-

   washed with plenty of MilliQ water before use to decontaminate the vials of RNAses. Two of the
   vials were used for the RNA working solution (2 mL in each vial) and the others for collecting the
   lipid and RNA mixes. The working lipid and RNA solutions were heated at 370 C for 10 min before
   being loaded into 3cc luer-lok syringes. Syringes containing RNA and the lipids were connected to a
 5 Mitos Droplet junction Chip (a glass microfluidic device obtained from Syrris, Part no. 3000158)
   using PTFE tubing 0.03 inches ID x 1/16 inch OD, (Syrris) using a 4-way edge connector. Two RNA
   streams and one lipid stream were driven by syringe pumps and the mixing of the ethanol and
   aqueous phase was done at the X junction (100 pim x 105 pim) of the chip. The flow rate of all three
   streams was kept at 1.5 mL/min, hence the ratio of total aqueous to ethanolic flow rate was 2:1. The
10 tube outlet was positioned to collect the mixtures in a 20 mL glass vial (while stirring). The stir bar
   was taken out and the ethanol/aqueous solution was allowed to equilibrate to room temperature for 1
   hour. Then the mixture was loaded in a 5 cc syringe which was fitted to a piece of PTFE tubing 0.03
   inches ID x 1/16inches OD and in another 5 cc syringe with equal length of PTFE tubing, an equal
   volume of 100 mM citrate buffer (pH 6) was loaded. The two syringes were driven at 3mL/min flow
15 rate using a syringe pump and the final mixture collected in a 20 mL glass vial (while stirring). Next,
   liposomes were concentrated to 2 mL and dialyzed against 10-15 volumes of IX PBS using the TFF
   system before recovering the final product. Hollow fiber filtration membranes with a 100 kDa pore
   size cutoff and 20cm 2 surface area were used. For in vitro and in vivo experiments, formulations were
   diluted to the required RNA concentration with IX PBS. Whereas liposomes prepared using the
20 syringe/tube method with 75pg RNA had a Z average diameter of 148nm and a polydispersity index
   of 0.122, the chip mixing gave liposomes with a Z average diameter of 97nm and a polydispersity
   index of 0.086. The proportion of encapsulated RNA decreased slightly from 90% to 87%.
   Encapsulation in liposomes was shown to protect RNA from RNase digestion. Experiments used
   3.8mAU of RNase A per microgram of RNA, incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature. RNase
25 was inactivated with Proteinase K at 55*C for 10 minutes. A 1:1 v/v mixture of sample to 25:24:1
   v/v/v, phenol:chloroform: isoamyl alcohol was then added to extract the RNA from the lipids into the
   aqueous phase. Samples were mixed by vortexing for a few seconds and then placed on a centrifuge
   for 15 minutes at 12k RPM. The aqueous phase (containing the RNA) was removed and used to
   analyze the RNA. Prior to loading (400 ng RNA per well) all the samples were incubated with
30 formaldehyde loading dye, denatured for 10 minutes at 65*C and cooled to room temperature.
   Ambion Millennium markers were used to approximate the molecular weight of the RNA construct.
   The gel was run at 90 V. The gel was stained using 0.1% SYBR gold according to the manufacturer's
   guidelines in water by rocking at room temperature for 1 hour. FIG. 1 shows that RNase completely
   digests RNA in the absence of encapsulation (lane 3). RNA is undetectable after encapsulation (lane
35 4), and no change is seen if these liposomes are treated with RNase (lane 4). After RNase-treated
   liposomes are subjected to phenol extraction, undigested RNA is seen (lane 6). Even after 1 week at
   4'C the RNA could be seen without any fragmentation (FIG. 4, arrow). Protein expression in vivo
                                                    -53-

   was unchanged after 6 weeks at 4 'C and one freeze-thaw cycle. Thus liposome-encapsulated RNA is
   stable.
   To assess in vivo expression of the RNA a reporter enzyme (SEAP; secreted alkaline phosphatase)
   was encoded in the replicon, rather than an immunogen. Expression levels were measured in sera
 5 diluted 1:4 in IX Phospha-Light dilution buffer using a chemiluminescent alkaline phosphate
   substrate. 8-10 week old BALB/c mice (5/group) were injected intramuscularly on day 0, 50pl per
   leg with 0.1 pg or 1jig RNA dose. The same vector was also administered without the liposomes (in
   RNase free IX PBS) at 1p g. Virion-packaged replicons were also tested. Virion-packaged replicons
   used herein (referred to as "VRPs") were obtained by the methods of reference 41, where the
10 alphavirus replicon is derived from the mutant VEEV or a chimera derived from the genome of
   VEEV engineered to contain the 3' UTR of Sindbis virus and a Sindbis virus packaging signal (PS),
   packaged by co-electroporating them into BHK cells with defective helper RNAs encoding the
   Sindbis virus capsid and glycoprotein genes.
   As shown in FIG. 5, encapsulation increased SEAP levels by about      2 log at the 1p g dose, and at day
15 6 expression from a 0.1 ptg encapsulated dose matched levels seen with 1pg unencapsulated dose. By
   day 3 expression levels exceeded those achieved with VRPs (squares). Thus expressed increased
   when the RNA was formulated in the liposomes relative to the naked RNA control, even at a lOx
   lower dose. Expression was also higher relative to the VRP control, but the kinetics of expression
   were very different (see FIG. 5). Delivery of the RNA with electroporation resulted in increased
20 expression relative to the naked RNA control, but these levels were lower than with liposomes.
   To assess whether the effect seen in the liposome groups was due merely to the liposome
   components, or was linked to the encapsulation, the replicon was administered in encapsulated form
   (with two different purification protocols, 0.1 pg RNA), or mixed with the liposomes after their
   formation (a non-encapsulated "lipoplex", 0.1pgg RNA), or as naked RNA (1p g). FIG. 10 shows that
25 the lipoplex gave the lowest levels of expression, showing that shows encapsulation is essential for
   potent expression.
   Further SEAP experiments showed a clear dose response in vivo, with expression seen after delivery
   of as little as Ing RNA (FIG. 6). Further experiments comparing expression from encapsulated and
   naked replicons indicated that 0.01 gg encapsulated RNA was equivalent to 1p g of naked RNA. At a
30 0.5pjg dose of RNA the encapsulated material gave a 12-fold higher expression at day 6; at a 0.1pg
   dose levels were 24-fold higher at day 6.
   Rather than looking at average levels in the group, individual animals were also studied. Whereas
   several animals were non-responders to naked replicons, encapsulation eliminated non-responders.
                                                    -54-

   Further experiments replaced DlinDMA with DOTAP ("RV13"). Although the DOTAP liposomes
   gave better expression than naked replicon, they were inferior to the DlinDMA liposomes (2- to 3
   fold difference at day 1).
   To assess in vivo immunogenicity a replicon was constructed to express full-length F protein from
 5 respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). This was delivered naked (1p fg), encapsulated in liposomes (0.1 or
    1gg), or packaged in virions (106 IU; "VRP") at days 0 and 21. FIG. 7 shows anti-F IgG titers 2
   weeks after the second dose, and the liposomes clearly enhance immunogenicity. FIG. 8 shows titers
   2 weeks later, by which point there was no statistical difference between the encapsulated RNA at
   0.1 gg, the encapsulated RNA at 1gg, or the VRP group. Neutralisation titers (measured as 60%
10 plaque reduction, "PRNT60") were not significantly different in these three groups 2 weeks after the
   second dose (FIG. 9). FIG. 12 shows both IgG and PRNT titers 4 weeks after the second dose.
   FIG. 13 confirms that the RNA elicits a robust CD8 T cell response.
   Further experiments compared F-specific IgG titers in mice receiving VRP, 0.1 Ig            liposome
   encapsulated RNA, or 1Ig liposome-encapsulated RNA. Titer ratios (VRP: liposome) at various
15 times after the second dose were as follows:
                                       2 weeks               4 weeks                  8 weeks
                        O.1pg            2.9                     1.0                      1.1
                          1tg            2.3                    0.9                      0.9
   Thus the liposome-encapsulated RNA induces essentially the same magnitude of immune response
   as seen with virion delivery.
   Further experiments showed superior F-specific IgG responses with a 10ptg dose, equivalent
   responses for 1p g and 0.1 ptg doses, and a lower response with a 0.01 pg dose. FIG. 11 shows IgG
20 titers in mice receiving the replicon in naked form at 3 different doses, in liposomes at 4 different
   doses, or as VRP (106 IU). The response seen with 1Ipg liposome-encapsulated RNA was statistically
   insignificant (ANOVA) when compared to VRP, but the higher response seen with 10pjg liposome
   encapsulated RNA was statistically significant (p<0.05) when compared to both of these groups.
   A further study confirmed that the 0.1pjg of liposome-encapsulated RNA gave much higher anti-F
25 IgG responses (15 days post-second dose) than 0.1pg of delivered DNA, and even was more
   immunogenic than 20gg plasmid DNA encoding the F antigen, delivered by electroporation
   (Elgen TM DNA Delivery System, Inovio).
   A further study was performed in cotton rats (Sigmodon hispidis) instead of mice. At a 1pjg dose
   liposome encapsulation increased F-specific IgG titers by 8.3-fold compared to naked RNA and
30 increased neutralisation titers (measured as PRNT60) by 9.5-fold. The magnitude of the antibody
                                                      6
   response was equivalent to that induced by 5x10      IU VRP. Both naked and liposome-encapsulated
                                                    -55-

                                                                         5
   RNA were able to protect the cotton rats from RSV challenge (xi0        plaque forming units), reducing
   lung viral load by at least 3.5 logs. Encapsulation increased the reduction by about 2-fold.
   A large-animal study was performed in cattle. Cows were immunised with 66ptg of replicon encoding
   full-length RSV F protein at days 0 and 21, formulated inside liposomes. PBS alone was used as a
 5 negative control, and a licensed vaccine was used as a positive control ("Triangle 4" from Fort
   Dodge, containing killed virus). FIG. 14 shows F-specific IgG titers over a 63 day period starting
   from the first immunisation. The RNA replicon was immunogenic in the cows, although it gave
   lower titers than the licensed vaccine. All vaccinated cows showed F-specific antibodies after the
   second dose, and titers were very stable from the period of 2 to 6 weeks after the second dose (and
10 were particularly stable for the RNA vaccine).
   Encapsulation in liposomes using alternative cationic lipids
   As an alternative to using DlinDMA, the cationic lipids of reference 8 are used. These lipids can be
   synthesised as disclosed in reference 8.
   The liposomes formed above using DlinDMA are referred to hereafter as the "RVOl" series. The
15 DlinDMA was replaced with various cationic lipids in series "RV02" to "RV12" as described below.
   Two different types of each liposome were formed, using 2% PEG2000-DMG with either (01) 40%
   of the cationic lipid, 10% DSPC, and 48% cholesterol, or (02) 60% of the cationic lipid and 38%
   cholesterol. Thus a comparison of the (01) and (02) liposomes shows the effect of the neutral
   zwitterionic lipid.

   FIG. 3 illustrates the SEAP expression levels seen at day 6. The best results were seen with RV04,
   RV05, RV07, RV08, RV09, and RV11.
   Various of these liposomes were also used to deliver a replicon encoding full-length RSV F protein.
   One study compared RVO1, RV05 and RV13; the highest F-specific serum IgG titers were seen with
 5 RVO1 and the lowest with RV13. Another study compared RVO1, RV02, RVO4 and RV07; the best
   results were again seen with RV01,with RV07 performing poorly. Another study compared RVO 1,
   RV03, RV08, RVO9 and RV14; the best results were again seen with RVO1, with RV03 and RV14
   performing poorly. Another study compared RVO1, RV1O, RV1 1 and RV15; the best results were
   again seen with RVO1. Overall, the best results were seen with RVO1, RV05, RV08 and RVO9,
10 whereas RV13 (DOTAP) and RV14 (DC-cholesterol) were poor.
   Thus not all of the liposomes were effective for eliciting immune responses. In general, though, it
   was observed that the best immunological efficacy was seen when the cationic lipid in the liposomes
   had a pKa in the range of 5.0 to 7.6, and particularly in the range 5.5 to 6.7, between 5.6 and 6.3,
   between 5.6 and 6.0, or between 5.7 and 5.9.
15 BHK expression
   Liposomes with different lipids were incubated with BHK cells overnight and assessed for protein
   expression potency. From a baseline with RV05 lipid, expression could be increased 18x by adding
    10% 1,2-diphytanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DPyPE) to the liposome or 1Ox by adding
    10% 18:2 (cis) phosphatidylcholine. In general, in vivo studies showed that unsaturated lipid tails
20 tend to enhance IgG titers raised against encoded antigens.
   RSV immunogenicity
   The vA317 self-replicating replicon encoding RSV F protein was administered to BALB/c mice, 4 or
   8 animals per group, by bilateral intramuscular vaccinations (50 pL per leg) on days 0 and 21 with
   the replicon (1 gg) alone or formulated as liposomes with RV05 or (for comparison) with RVO 1 or
25 RV13. The RVO1 liposomes had 40% DlinDMA, 10% DSPC, 48% cholesterol and 2% PEG-DMG,
   but with differing amounts of RNA. The RV05 liposomes had either 40% RV05, 10% DSPC, 48%
   cholesterol and 2% PEG-DMG or 60% RV05, 38% cholesterol and 2% PEG-DMG. The RV13
   liposomes had 40% DOTAP, 10% DOPE, 48% cholesterol and 2% PEG-DMG. The liposomes were
   prepared using various techniques. For comparison, naked plasmid DNA (20 pg) expressing the
30 same RSV-F antigen was delivered either using electroporation or with RVO1(10) liposomes (0.1ig
   DNA). Four mice were used as a naive control group.

   Thus the liposome formulations significantly enhanced immunogenicity relative to the naked RNA
   controls, as determined by increased F-specific IgG titers and T cell frequencies. Plasmid DNA
   formulated with liposomes, or delivered naked using electroporation, was significantly less
   immunogenic than liposome-formulated self-replicating RNA.
 5 RSV immunogenicity in different mouse strains
   Replicon "vA 142" encodes the full-length wild type surface fusion (F) glycoprotein of RSV but with
   the fusion peptide deleted, and the 3' end is formed by ribozyme-mediated cleavage. It was tested in
   three different mouse strains.
   BALB/c mice were given bilateral intramuscular vaccinations (50 gL per leg) on days 0 and 22.
10 Animals were divided into 8 test groups (5 animals per group) and a naive control (2 animals):
       Group 1 were given naked replicon (1 pg).
       Group 2 were given 1Ig replicon delivered in liposomes "RV01(37)" with 40% DlinDMA, 10%
       DSPC, 48% Chol, 2% PEG-conjugated DMG.
       Group 3 were given the same as group 2, but at 0.1 pg RNA.
15     Group 4 were Iig replicon in "RV05(1 1)" liposomes (40% RV05 lipid, 30% 18:2 PE (DLoPE,

   Thus cotton rats were vaccinated with vA142 replicon formulated with RVO1 or RV05, and the
   replicon was given at two doses (1.0 and 0.1 jig). After the first replicon vaccination F-specific
   serum IgG titers were higher with RVO1 than RV05, but neutralization titers were approximately
   equal. Titers in all groups were boosted by a homologous second vaccination given on day 21. After
15 the second replicon vaccination, F-specific serum IgG titers were again higher with RVO1 than with
   RV05, and RSV neutralization titers generally followed this same trend.
   The protein vaccination at day 49 did not boost antibody titers in cotton rats previously vaccinated
   with protein, but it provided a large boost to titers in cotton rats previously vaccinated with RNA.
   The titers (total IgG and neutralization) were higher at day 64 using RV05 than when using RVO 1.

 5 For comparison of immunogenicity, HT, SUV and MLV liposomes were also made with RV01,
   using the same components at the same proportions, but with manufacturing methods which are non
   scalable (but are quicker). Briefly, an ethanol stock solution was created containing 37mg/ml
   DLinDMA, 12mg/ml DSPC, 28mg/ml cholesterol, and 8 mg/ml of PEG DMG 2000.                100gl of the
   stock solution was diluted in a total of 1ml of ethanol. Liposomes were prepared by evaporating the
10 ethanol solution using a rotary evaporator at 150 milliTorr, pressure for 30 minutes at 50'C.
   Residual ethanol evaporation was insured by placing the samples overnight under vacuum in a freeze
   dryer. The lipid film was hydrated and dispersed by adding 1.0 mL of filtered deionized water and
   placed at 50*C to ensure full suspension of the lipids into MLVs. An aliquot was removed from the
   MLVs and sonicated with a probe sonicator with a 1 second pulse for 5 minutes at 100% power fo
15 form the SUVs. Both of the resulting solutions were complexed with replicon RNA. The HT
   liposomes were made using an ethanol stock solution containing 37mg/ml DLinDMA, 12mg/ml
   DSPC, 28mg/ml cholesterol, and 8 mg/ml of PEG DMG 2000. 100pl             of the stock solution was
   diluted to 400pl with ethanol. The resulting ethanol solution was added drop wise to 600pl of 10mM
   citrate buffer at pH 6.5 containing 40pg of RNA under constant stirring. The resulting solution was
20 dialyzed overnight against 4L of PBS buffer using a 10,000 MWCO dialysis membrane.

   Except for liposome   Q each  of these liposomes performed better than the control. The RV 10 lipid in
   liposome  Q has a pKa   of 7.86 which seems too high to be useful in vivo. Even inside the useful pKa
   range of 5.0 to 7.6, however, although results were good, none of the lipids with one alkyl tail and
 5 one steroid-containing tail gave results as good as RVO 1.

   For a cationic lipid with an asymmetrical lipid tails (alkyl + cholesterol), changing the neutral lipid
   from DSPC (saturated C18 lipid tail) to 18:2 or 18:3 PC (with 2 and 3 unsaturated double bonds per
   tail) increased total IgG titers. Comparable results were observed by replacing DSPC with DPyPE.
 5 In a final experiment with the RV05 lipid a liposome was made with 40% RV05, 10% 18:2 PC, 40%
   DPyPE, 8% cholesterol and 2% PEG DMG 2000. These liposomes had a Zav diameter of 124.7nm, a
   pdl of 0.17 and a RNA encapsulation of 61.5%. They were used to vaccinate BALB/c mice as before
   (0.1pig RNA dose), in comparison with naked RNA (lIpg) or with RVO1-based liposomes (40%
   DlinDMA, 10% DPSC, 48% cholesterol, 2% PEG DMG 2000). F-specific serum IgG titers (GMT)

   Thus the RV05 liposomes were more immunogenic than naked RNA, but less immunogenic than
