Background of the Invention.
         [0002]      Structural transformations are an important part of the modern food
industry. Raw materials are changed into refined food products by processing agricultural
output. A major objective of food structuring is to recombine food components for improved
utilization of food resources. Alternatively, from an economic prospective, such restructuring
can be designed to yield products deemed more valuable in the market place.
         [0003]      More specifically, restructuring is directed to four basic food components:
water, proteins, fats and carbohydrates. Micronutrients (e.g., vitamins and minerals) and
other microcomponents such as flavors, colors, preservatives and other functional additives
(e.g., stabilizers, emulsifiers, etc.) are often introduced at some point during the restructuring
process. Regardless, of the four basic components, restructuring processes are most often
directed to proteins and starches. Reasons underlying protein and starch restructure include a
worldwide demand for dietary protein and carbohydrates and higher prices associated with
these foods, thereby supporting higher profit margins and corresponding economic activity.
         [0004]      The preparation and subsequent use of soy milk, basically a suspension of
ground soybeans and water, is well-known and illustrates several widely used techniques for
protein restructuring. While soy milk can be consumed as a beverage or fermented, it is more
often used as a starting material for several other structured food products. For instance, tofu
is prepared by precipitating soy milk proteins with a calcium salt to form a coagulum that is
then drained, pressed and washed to yield a proteinaceous food product.
         [0005]      Various other restructuring techniques can be considered in the context of
comminuted meat products, whereby an oil-in-water emulsion is entrapped in a gel of
insoluble proteins and muscle fibers. A raw meat protein matrix system, typically low-value,
high-connective tissue meat cuts or trimmings, is ground to reduce particle size. After initial
grinding, the meat protein matrix is blended with various emulsifying salts (e.g., phosphates,
etc.) and other ingredients to promote extraction of a myofibrillar binder. Such muscle
proteins bind better under elevated temperature conditions. In these processes, cooking
serves to reactivate the protein binder, recombine the ground particles and complete the
                                                      1

    WO 2014/146010                                                            PCT/US2014/030879
restructuring process. Such meat-emulsions are quite stable, but even if coalescence does
occur, movement of the fat globules is confined by the restructured protein matrix.
         [0006]      Cheese illustrates other aspects relating to protein restructuring. From a
historical perspective, process cheese was initially developed to address homogeneity and
shelf-life issues inherent to natural cheese. While natural cheese is made directly from milk,
process cheese is produced by blending one or more natural cheeses in the presence of
emulsifying agents and, optionally, other dairy and non-dairy ingredients. Heat processing
with continuous mixing leads to a more homogeneous product with extended shelf life.
Under the United States Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), process cheese is a generic term
including pasteurized process cheeses, pasteurized process cheese foods and pasteurized
process cheese spreads, all of which are regulated on the basis of process parameters,
ingredients, fat and moisture content and the like. (See, 21 CFR 133.169 - 133.180.)
Together with choice of natural cheese (e.g., with respect to age, flavor, etc.), selection of an
appropriate emulsifying agent is a key consideration in determining the physiochemical and
functional properties of a resulting process cheese.
         [0007]      Currently, thirteen emulsifying agents (either alone or in combination) are
approved for use: mono-, di-, and trisodium phosphates, dipotassium phosphate, sodium
hexametaphosphate, sodium acid pyrophosphate, tetrasodium pyrophosphate, sodium
aluminum phosphate, sodium citrate, potassium citrate, calcium citrate, sodium tartrate, and
sodium potassium tartrate. The most common emulsifying salts used for process cheese
manufacture in the United States are trisodium citrate and disodium phosphate. Trisodium
citrate is the preferred emulsifying salt for slice-on-slice process cheese varieties, whereas
disodium phosphate (or appropriate combinations of di- and trisodium phosphates) is used in
loaf-type process cheese and process cheese spreads. In certain applications, low levels of
sodium hexametaphosphate are also used along with these emulsifying salts. Sodium
aluminum phosphate is frequently used in conjunction with mozzarella type imitation process
cheese varieties to replace mozzarella on frozen pizzas. Regardless, the weight of the solids
of such an emulsifying salt or salts is not more than 3 percent of the weight of a
corresponding CFR-defined process cheese. (21 CFR § 133.169(c).) Emulsifiers used in
process cheese not defined by the CFR follow the tenants of being safe and suitable.
         [0008]      Generally, emulsifying salts serve to sequester calcium and adjust pH.
Both functions assist hydration of proteins present in natural cheese, to facilitate interaction
with the aqueous and fat phases, thereby producing a more homogeneous emulsion. More
specifically, the function of such salts can be understood by contrasting it to natural cheese
                                                    2

    WO 2014/146010                                                          PCT/US2014/030879
production. Bovine milk is characterized by four major types of casein proteins: asi-casein,
as2-casein, 0-casein and K-casein--each of which is amphiphilic, with hydrophobic and
hydrophilic components, and containing covalently-attached phosphate groups. In an
aqueous emulsion environment, milk caseins adopt a micellular configuration stabilized by
protein-protein hydrophobic interactions and colloidal calcium phosphate-mediated cross
linking. K-casein is primarily present on the micelle surface, with the hydrophobic
component embedded therein and a negatively-charged hydrophilic component directed
outward into the aqueous phase. Micelles repel each other, thereby stabilizing the emulsion.
During natural cheese production, enzymatic (e.g., rennet) action on K-casein cleaves the
hydrophilic component destabilizing the micelles. Calcium-mediated cross-linking between
phosphoserine residues of the a- and 0-caseins produces a network of water-insoluble
calcium-paracaseinate phosphate complexes, commonly referred to as curds, with the fat
phase suspended therein.
         [0009]      In contrast to natural cheese, process cheese can be described as a stable
oil-in-water emulsion. Emulsifying agents, such as the salts described above, improve casein
emulsification by--in conjunction with continued heating and mixing--displacing the calcium
phosphate complexes and dispersing the calcium-paracaseinate phosphate network. The
dispersed network interacts with the fat phase and, upon cooling, provides a process cheese
structure--new and distinct from a natural cheese structure with a fat phase emulsified by a
uniform protein gel.
         [0010]      The resulting stable, homogeneous process cheese structure affords a wide
range of product forms (e.g., loaves, slices, grates, shreds, spreads and the like) and a
corresponding range of end-use applications in the food preparation and service industry.
However, the prior art recognizes a number of drawbacks and deficiencies, several of which
can be directly related to the use of emulsifying salts. For instance, unsightly crystal
formation is observed and has been linked to the relative insolubility of various phosphate
and citrate salts, as further influenced by pH or storage conditions. From a more functional
perspective, oil separation can result from improper salt content in conjunction with pH,
casein level and process temperature considerations. Further, unmelted and melted textural
properties of process cheese can be adversely affected by choice of emulsifying salt. Perhaps
most consequential, adverse consumer perceptions are drawn from inclusion of emulsifying
salts (e.g., pyrophosphates, aluminum phosphates, etc.) on product labels.
         [0011]      Accordingly, together with other long-standing issues related to process
cheese, there remains an on-going concern in the art to provide a cheese product affording
                                                    3

starting materials.
         [0015]      It can be another object of the present invention, alone or in conjunction
with one or more of the preceding objectives, to achieve such results without emulsifying
salts of the sort used for process cheese.

         [0017]      Generally, the present invention can be directed to a method of preparing a
restructured proteinaceous food product. Such a method can comprise providing an initial
matrix system comprising water, fat, protein and salts; treating such a matrix system with a
modification component comprising a reagent selected from hydroxide species, anionic basic
species and combinations thereof, such a reagent as can be in an amount at least partially
sufficient to modify a secondary, tertiary or quaternary structure of such a matrix protein,
such modification as can be considered with respect to a visco-elastic property of such a
matrix system; and interacting such a modified matrix system with a flavoring composition
                                                      4

    WO 2014/146010                                                          PCT/US2014/030879
comprising at least one flavor component uniquely formulated for a particular proteinaceous
food product, such a flavoring composition as can be in an amount at least partially sufficient
to restructure such a modified matrix system. In certain embodiments, each of the
aforementioned treatment or matrix modification and interaction or matrix restructure steps
can be conducted at ambient/room temperatures and pressures, lower such temperatures,
elevated such temperatures, positive pressures, negative pressures and/or combinations of
such conditions. In certain such embodiments, elevated temperatures can be accomplished by
heating such a matrix system through conduction, convection, microwave and infrared
processes, and combinations thereof, or as would otherwise be understood by those skilled in
the art made aware of this invention.
         [0018]     Regardless, a fat component of such a matrix system can be selected from
animal fats, vegetable fats, fats derived from microbiological sources and combinations
thereof; and, independently, a protein of such a matrix system can be selected from animal
proteins, vegetable proteins, proteins derived from microbiological sources and combinations
thereof. Without regard to fat or protein identity, a matrix modification component can be
selected from food grade alkaline metal hydroxide salts, food grade Lewis base reagents and
combinations thereof. Likewise, without regard to fat and protein identity or matrix
modification component utilized, such a flavoring composition can comprise components
selected from organic alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, acids, acid salts, acid esters, mineral acids
and acid salts, and combinations thereof. As mentioned above and illustrated elsewhere
herein, such a composition, upon interaction with a modified matrix system, can be
formulated to provide a restructured proteinaceous food product with one or more flavor
characteristics.
         [0019]     Without limitation as to flavoring composition, matrix system fat/protein
or modification component, one or more optional additives can be introduced at a time of
matrix treatment/modification or interaction/matrix restructure or both, such additives as can
be chosen to affect flavor, texture, moisture content and one or more other characteristics of a
restructured proteinaceous food product. Likewise, without limitation, such additives can be
selected from proteins, fats, oils, carbohydrates, preservatives, minerals, nutrients and
combinations thereof, in an amount at least partially sufficient to affect one or more food
product characteristics. In certain such embodiments, one or more dried or partially dried
proteins, carbohydrates and combinations thereof can be utilized to affect moisture content.
In various other embodiments, alone or together with other such additives(s), one or more
flavors, spices, colorants, extracts, fruits, meats and combinations thereof can be utilized to
                                                    5

    WO 2014/146010                                                           PCT/US2014/030879
affect flavor. Further, certain embodiments can incorporate various enzymes, cultures and/or
related probiotic additives and combinations thereof. Any such additive can be synthetic or
derived from various plant, animal and microbiological sources and combinations thereof.
         [0020]      Regardless, a modified matrix system can be restructured to provide a
proteinaceous food product with a texture comprising one or more characteristics of an initial
matrix system or modified characteristics unique to a particular end-result proteinaceous food
product.
         [0021]      In part, the present invention can also be directed toward a method of
preparing a restructured dairy or dairy analog based food product. Such a method can
comprise providing an initial matrix system comprising water, fat, protein selected from dairy
proteins and dairy analog proteins and combinations thereof, and salts; treating such a matrix
system with a modification component comprising a reagent selected from excess hydroxide
species, anionic basic species and combinations thereof, such a reagent as can be in an
amount at least partially sufficient to modify a secondary, tertiary or quaternary structure of
such a matrix protein, such modification as can be considered with respect to a visco-elastic
property of such a matrix system; and interacting such a modified matrix system with a
flavoring composition comprising at least one flavor component uniquely formulated for a
particular proteinaceous food product, such a flavoring composition as can be in an amount at
least partially sufficient to restructure such a modified matrix system. As discussed above, in
certain embodiments, each of the aforementioned treatment/matrix modification or
interaction/matrix restructure steps, or both can be conducted at ambient temperatures and
pressures, lower such temperatures, elevated such temperatures, positive pressures, negative
pressures or combinations of such conditions.
         [0022]      Without limitation, fat and matrix modification components can be as
discussed above or illustrated elsewhere herein. Regardless, such a flavoring composition
can comprise component ingredients selected from organic alcohols, aldehydes, ketones,
acids, acid salts, acid esters, mineral acids and acid salts and combinations thereof. In certain
embodiments, such component ingredients can include one or more organic acids, one or
more mineral acids or combinations thereof (e.g., one or more protic acids). In certain such
embodiments, matrix pH, structure and/or functionality can be adjusted depending on desired
food product. More generally, such a composition can be formulated to provide such a
restructured product, a dairy or cheese flavor, such flavors as can be selected from, but are
not limited to cheddar, parmesan, romano, provolone, swiss, mozzarella, blue and cream
cheese, sour cream and yogurt, together with various other dairy/cheese flavors or
                                                    6

    WO 2014/146010                                                           PCT/US2014/030879
combinations thereof as would be understood by those skilled in the art made aware of this
invention.
         [0023]     As discussed above and illustrated elsewhere herein, such a modified
matrix system can be restructured with control of various thermal-related rheological
properties corresponding to a protein and/or fat component thereof. Such control can be at
least in part defined or monitored by the degree of oiling-off (e.g., ranging from the absence
to an excess thereof), such a phenomenon as can be incident to consumer food preparation.
         [0024]     In part, the present invention can also be directed to a method of preparing
or using protein structure modification to prepare a restructured cheese. Such a method can
comprise providing a proteinaceous natural cheese comprising an initial fat and water
content; treating such cheese with an aqueous medium, such a medium comprising a basic
species at least partially sufficient to modify and/or impart a liquid consistency to such a
natural cheese starting material; and interacting such a modified natural cheese with a
flavoring composition of the sort discussed above and illustrated elsewhere herein, such a
composition as can be in an amount at least partially sufficient to restore or restructure such a
natural cheese. More generally, as discussed above, such a method can comprise providing a
proteinaceous natural cheese component; treating such a component with a protein structure
modification component comprising a base, such a modification component in an amount and
of a pH to modify a protein structure of such a natural cheese component; and interacting or
treating such a modified natural cheese component with a flavoring composition comprising
an acid and at least one flavor component, such a flavoring composition in an amount and of
a pH to restructure such a modified natural cheese component and provide it with a desired
flavor characteristic.
         [0025]     Without limitation, a natural cheese starting material can be selected from
mozzarella and cheddar type cheeses. Regardless, cheese restructured therefrom can
comprise a moisture and/or fat content similar to or different from that of the natural cheese
starting material. In certain embodiments, such a flavoring composition can be formulated to
provide such a restructured natural cheese a flavor or textural characteristic, or both, distinct
from those of the starting material. Accordingly, in certain such embodiments, a restructured
natural cheese of this invention can be, for instance, a parmesan or a provolone cheese.
Without limitation, such a flavoring composition can be provided as a dry blend, part of an
aqueous formulation or a combination thereof, interaction of which with a modified natural
cheese matrix can be accomplished simultaneously or step-wise.

         [0026]      Optional additives can be as discussed above or illustrated elsewhere

restructure or both. In certain embodiments, one or more dry animal proteins, vegetable
proteins or combinations thereof can be introduced to affect moisture content, stability or
subsequent physical manipulation and packaging of such a restructured natural cheese. In
certain such embodiments, such additives are limited only by salts of a nature or in an amount
to at least partially emulsify a protein component of a natural cheese starting material--such
salt or amount thereof, the presence of which would otherwise be understood by those skilled
in the art as providing a process cheese.

Detailed Description of Certain Embodiments.
         [0029]      Various non-limiting embodiments of this invention can be considered
with reference to the schematic flowchart of Figure 1. A starting natural cheese material is
treated with food grade aqueous base of sufficient concentration and volume, with mixing, to
provide a modified cheese matrix of pH about 5 to about 12.5. In certain embodiments,
depending upon starting material and desired restructured cheese product, the matrix is
modified and the pH can be about 8 to about 10. Thereafter, with mixing, a unique
formulated flavoring composition is introduced to adjust matrix pH, structure and/or
functionality depending on desired cheese variety. As discussed above and illustrated below,
such a flavoring composition can be formulated to include a food grade proton donor or
Lewis acid component. In doing so, the visco-elastic properties of the restructured matrix can
be either maintained so as to approximate those of the natural cheese starting material or
altered to provide new visco-elastic properties and related textures. Regardless, continued
processing of the restructured cheese product can include cutting, slicing, shredding, mixing,
grinding, heating and/or dispersing the restructured product, or incorporating into a prepared
food product prior to packaging or distribution.
         [0030]      As used herein, the term "visco" pertains to the rheological parameters of
materials such that imparted stress energy and the resultant strain energy is dissipated into the
material in the form of heat.

         [0031]      Also, as used herein, the term "elastic" pertains to the rheological
parameters of materials such that imparted stress energy and the resultant strain energy is
stored in the material and can be recovered fully upon removal of the stress.
         [0032]      Also, as used herein, the term "visco-elastic" pertains to rheological
parameters of materials such that imparted stress energy and the resultant strain energy has
both a partial stored strain that can be recovered upon removal of the stress and a partial
strain energy that is dissipated into the material in the form of heat. Various instruments and
methods can be used to measure or observe visco-elastic properties, such instruments
including, but not limited to, viscometers, penetrometers, shear force cutting machines, flow
devices, as well as melting tests or recipes having numeric or judgmental evaluations.
         [0033]      As discussed above, certain embodiments of this invention can be
undertaken at ambient temperatures or pressures. Nonetheless, depending upon any
particular cheese starting material, reagent, additive or restructured cheese product desired or
combinations thereof, any process step, including matrix modification or matrix restructuring,
or both, can be conducted at temperatures from about -20 'C to about 140 'C and at pressures
from 0 to about 15,000 psi. Any such method step can be performed under pressure or
vacuum, optionally with cooling or upon heating or an appropriate time or at a time at least
partially sufficient to achieve a desired intermediate, end result or both. For instance,
application of suitable pressure, at an appropriate temperature, structure, density or texture, or
a combination thereof, can be imparted to obtain a desired restructured cheese product.
         [0034]      Figure 1 is provided only by way of illustration and is not intended to limit
the scope of this invention in any way. A starting cheese material can be selected from
various cheddar, monterey jack, swiss and mozzarella-type cheeses and combinations thereof,
together with other cheeses of comparable relative value as would be understood by those
skilled in the art made aware of this invention. For instance, such a starting material can be
any cheese by-product of trims generation from cut-wrap operations, or any cheese material
in or out of standard specification accepted in trade for a given cheese variety. Selection can
also take into consideration moisture and fat content of any one or more cheese starting
materials or restructured cheese products. With regard to the latter, methods of this invention
can be specifically designed and tailored to provide, without limitation, particular cheddar,
parmesan, romano, provolone, swiss, gouda, camembert, mozzarella or blue-style
restructured cheese products. From an economic perspective, such a product can be selected
from these and various other cheeses of higher relative value as compared to a starting

material from which it was prepared. Such restructured products are limited only by a
corresponding flavoring composition and the flavor components thereof.
         [0035]     In addition to the aforementioned cheese flavors, chocolate, tofu, fruit,
vegetable, fish, meat, cured meat such as but not limited to bacon, sausage, sourdough, beer,
wine, alcoholic spirit, surimi, legume paste flavors and combinations thereof can be
introduced. Regardless, a wide range of other additives can be incorporated with such a
starting material to affect structure, flavor, preservation, nutrient value, stabilization, color or
any combination thereof. Any such additive can be introduced at any process point, but
preferably at a point before, during or after matrix modification or, alternatively, at a point
before, during or after matrix restructuring. Such additives include but are not limited to
flavors, spices, extracts, fruits, meats, enzymes and combinations thereof. Further, various
probiotics can also be introduced, alone or in conjunction with other additives, such
probiotics including live or deactivated microorganisms, such as eukaryotes, prokaryotes,
yeasts, fungi, molds, protozoa and combinations of such live and deactivated
microorganisms.
Examples of the Invention.
         [0036]     The following non-limiting examples and data illustrate various aspect and
features relating to the methods and restructured cheese products of the present invention,
including the preparation of various value-added, restructured natural cheese products, as are
available through the methodologies described herein. In comparison with the prior art, the
present methods and restructured products provide results and data which are surprising,
unexpected and contrary thereto. While the utility of this invention is illustrated through
several starting natural cheese materials, reagents, process parameters and resulting
restructured cheese products, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that comparable
results are obtainable using various other natural cheese starting materials and process
parameters and through corresponding restructured cheese products, as are commensurate
with the scope of this invention.
         [0037]     All natural cheese starting materials, including trims, cuts and the like, are
available from sources well-known to those skilled in art. Likewise, food grade reagents and
additives are also commercially-available. In particular, natural flavoring compositions, such
as but not limited to cheddar, provolone and parmesan flavoring compositions, are available
from Jeneil Biotech, Inc. of Saukville, Wisconsin.

                                           Example 1
        [0038]      With reference to Figure 2, natural cheddar cheese is treated with aqueous
base, with mixing, to provide a modified cheese matrix of pH 9.5. With mixing, a selected
natural flavoring composition is added for interaction with the modified cheese matrix,
bringing the pH to 5.2.
                                           Example 2
        [0039]      A variation of the method of Example 1 is to provide cheddar cheese
(79 wt.%), natural cheddar flavoring composition (17.0 wt.%), and aqueous base (4 wt.%). A
restructured cheddar-style cheese product is about 40 wt.% moisture, 30 wt.% fat and 3 wt.%
salt.
                                           Example 3
        [0040]      With reference to Example 2, bacon flavoring and/or bacon bits are
introduced at a point before, during or after matrix restructuring.
                                           Example 4
        [0041]      With reference to Example 2, one or more probiotic cultures, of the sort
well-known to those skilled in the art, are introduced. Thereafter, process temperature may
be raised from ambient to deactivate at least a portion of one or more such cultures.
                                           Example 5
        [0042]      With reference to Example 2, moisture content of a resulting restructured
cheese product is adjusted and/or stabilizers are introduced, according to desired form (e.g.,
block, slices, spread, etc.)
                                           Example 6
        [0043]      A parmesan-style cheese is prepared with mozzarella cheese (76 wt.%,
dried to 27% moisture), natural parmesan flavoring composition (16 wt.%) and aqueous
sodium hydroxide (8 wt.%). A restructured parmesan-style cheese product is 35% moisture,
25% fat and 4% salt.
                                           Example 7
        [0044]      With reference to Example 6, dried cheese powder is added to lower
moisture content to less than 32%.

                                          Example 8
        [0045]      With reference to Example 6, additional soy and/or dairy protein (e.g.,
whey protein isolates) are added to lower moisture content, to vary texture and/or to stabilize
the cheese product, depending on end-use.
                                          Example 9
        [0046]      Another parmesan-style cheese is prepared with mozzarella cheese
(65 wt.%, dried to 20% moisture), swiss cheese (15 wt.%), parmesan cheese (5 wt.%), natural
parmesan flavoring composition (8.0 wt.%), aqueous base (6 wt.%), and added salt (1 wt.%).
A restructured parmesan-style cheese product is 310% moisture, 26% fat and 4% salt.

        [0047]      A provolone-style cheese is prepared with mozzarella cheese (44 wt.%),
cheddar cheese (45 wt.%), natural provolone flavoring composition (7.0 wt.%) and aqueous
base (4.0 wt.%). A restructured provolone-style cheese product is 45% moisture, 25% fat,
and 2% salt.
        [0048]      Referring to Examples 11-21, below, natural cheese products were
prepared with the following natural cheese curd components, each of which is commercially
available from sources as are well-known to those skilled in the art:
        [0049]      1. Lowfat acid curd: Grade A dry curd cottage cheese (no cream
dressing);
        [0050]      2. Cheese curd: Cheddar cheese;
        [0051]      3.  Lowfat curd: the moisture is more than maximum moisture content
allowed for skim cheese. That same curd could also be partially dried at about 24 to about
30% moisture to meet the definition of skim cheese);
        [0052]      4. Low moisture part skim curd: low moisture part skim mozzarella, but
with partial moisture removed as well (moisture ranges: about 18 to about 22% moisture,
about 25 to about 29% moisture, and about 44 to about 48% moisture);
        [0053]      5.  Eyed cheese curd: Emmenthal, US style Swiss and Baby Swiss,
Gouda, Raclette, and Gruyere; and
        [0054]      6. Cheese curd direct acid set: hydrochloric acid added to milk for 6.08
pH, rennet set, cut, cooked to 39.30 C (102.7 F), and whey-drained curd. Processed over the
course of 2 hrs, 40 mins.
        [0055]      Food grade base and acid components are commercially available from
sources well known to those skilled in the art. For instance, food grade sodium hydroxide

and hydrochloric acid are available from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Cheese and dairy
flavor components are, as described above, available from Jeneil Biotech, Inc. of Saukville,
Wisconsin. Such flavor components can be blended, dry or in an aqueous medium, with an
acid or base to provide, as would be understood by those in the art made aware of this
invention, a corresponding modification component or flavoring composition. A
modification component and flavoring composition can be, respectively, added with mixing
until desired pH and protein structure are obtained. With reference to Figures 1 and 2,
restructured natural cheese products were prepared as described below.
