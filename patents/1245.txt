                                    ABSTRACT
         Electro-magnetic (EM) energy collected in three dimensions, in layers
allows for multiple planes to function operatively with optimized band gap
structures whereby integrated variant and overlapping three-dimensional
electro-magnetic films permit systems to collect energy across the entire
electro-magnetic spectrum, and present systems utilizing both direct and
indirect light to be leveraged. The EM-CS captures and contains more energy
from EMR than conventional systems addressing global energy needs.

THE CLAIMS DEFINING THE INVENTION ARE AS FOLLOWS:
1.      An electromagnetic energy capturing system (EM-CS), which
comprises, in combination:
         at least a body of a material comprising an upper surface and a lower
surface, wherein the upper surface receives electromagnetic radiation (EMR)
comprising ultraviolet, visible and/or infrared radiation having wavelengths
between 200 and 5,000 nm; and
        wherein the upper surface and the lower surface reflect internal EMR
back into the material;
         the material spans three dimensions of space between the upper surface
and the lower surface, whereby the internal EMR interacts with the material in
three dimensions; and
         the material contains a multi-layered arrangement of films comprising a
plurality of semiconductors defined by a plurality of bandgaps, whereby EMR
travelling in the material is captured by the films and excites electrons from a
valence band to a conduction band in the semiconductors; and
         at least one electrode is in contact with the semiconductors to provide
electrical energy.
2.       The system of claim 1, wherein the lower surface defines a parabolic
curve having a focus within the material.
3.       The system of claim 1 or claim 2, further comprising a first electrode and
a second electrode in contact with the semiconductors and defining a first
electrical contact and a second electrical contact accessible from an exterior of
the material.
23/02/18

                                        25
4.      The system of any one of claims 1 to 3, wherein the upper surface is a
curved surface, and wherein the curved surface is shaped such that when the
material is located outdoors on a cloudless day, direct sunlight defines a normal
to the curved surface from sunup to sundown.
5.      The system of claim 3 or claim 4, wherein exposure of the upper surface
to infrared EMR produces a voltage across the first electrical contact and the
second electrical contact.
6.      The system of any one of claims 1 to 5, wherein exposure of the upper
surface to the EMR produces at least 2 kW per M 3 .
7.      The system of any one of claims 1 to 6, wherein the material comprises
tempered phosphate, MgF2 and sapphire glass, and further comprising an
angled silvered-apical prism to enable the material to receive and capture
indirect EMR.
8.      The system of claim 1, wherein the films comprise at least three films
formed by a process using argon gas.
9.      The system of claim 8, wherein the films are transparent and stable.
10.     The system of any one of claims 1 to 9, wherein the system is configured
to absorb the EMR received through the upper surface with less than 6-8% of
the EMR refracted.

                                       26
11.    The system of any one of claims 1 to 10, further comprising double
parabolic reflecting bases.
12.    The system of claim 7, wherein the angled silvered-apical prism creates
prismatic focusing which increases capture of EMR by the films twofold.
13.    The system of any one of claims 1 to 12, wherein the lower surface
comprises a parabolic mirror surface that forces EMR back through the material
such that photons of EMR, on average, pass through the material at least 7
times, and at least some of the photons of EMR pass through the material 37
times.
