          INSULATED GLASS UNIT TESTING METHOD AND APPARATUS
                                       TECHNICAL FIELD
   This disclosure relates to an apparatus and method for testing an insulated glass
 5 unit (IGU). The apparatus and method have use in assessing adhesion of adhesive
   used to join components in an IGU.
                                      BACKGROUND ART
   Insulated glass units (IGUs) are generally formed from two parallel glass panes
   with a spacer therebetween. The spacer ensures the glass panes have a consistent
10 separation, and is secured to each glass pane by way of adhesive.
   It is important that the adhesive securing the glass panes to the spacer has
   sufficient adhesion properties. Inadequate adhesion could lead to an IGU that is
   structurally defective, and may result in separation of one or both of the glass
   panes from the spacer in use.
15 It is to be understood that, if any prior art is referred to herein, such reference does
   not constitute an admission that the prior art forms a part of the common general
   knowledge in the art, in Australia or any other country.
                                           SUMMARY
   Disclosed herein is a method for testing an insulated glass unit (IGU) sample.
20 The sample comprises at least two glass panes spaced from one another by a
   spacer that is disposed therebetween. The spacer is adhered to the glass panes by
   an adhesive. The method comprises driving a separator between the glass panes
   to at least partially separate at least one of the glass panes from the spacer. The
   method also comprises inspecting the sample after the panes have been at least
25 partially separated, in order to assess the adhesion of the adhesive.
                                                1
   9722039_1 (GHMatters) P103280.AU.1

   It should be appreciated that the method may be used for testing an IGU that
   comprises more than two glass panes, spaced from each other by a plurality of
   spacers (e.g. a so-called triple glazed IGU). Where there are more than two glass
   panes, typically the spacer is only driven between just two of the glass panes at a
 5 time.
   The method can provide a consistent, reliable, safe, and repeatable way of
   assessing the adhesion of the adhesive in an IGU sample.
   In one embodiment inspecting the sample may comprise verifying whether
   adhesive remains on separated portions of the spacer and the at least partially
10 separated glass pane.
   In one embodiment the method may further comprise identifying that the sample
   is acceptable if adhesive remains on a substantial portion of the separated portions
   of both the spacer and the at least partially separated glass pane.
   In one embodiment the method may comprise an initial step of forming the
15 sample by adhering a spacer between the at least two glass panes using an
   adhesive.
   In one embodiment the adhesive may be a butyl-based adhesive. For example, the
   adhesive may be polyisobutylene. In addition to providing an adhering function,
   the adhesive may provide a seal between the spacer and the glass panes.
20 In one embodiment the step of forming the sample may comprise arranging the
   spacer so as to extend along a portion of the periphery of the glass panes. In this
   way, the spacer may define a sealed portion of the periphery, and an open portion
   of the periphery defining an opening to the space between the glass panes for
   receipt of the separator. For example, where the sample is rectangular, the spacer
25 may extend along three edges of the glass panes, and the fourth edge may remain
   open (i.e. without the spacer extending along the fourth edge).
   In one embodiment the step of forming the sample may comprise arranging the
   spacer such that a portion of the spacer extends beyond the periphery of the glass
                                               2
   9722039_1 (GHMatters) P103280.AU.1

   panes to form a handle for handling the sample. This portion of the spacer may be
   removed prior to driving the separator between the glass panes (in order to allow
   access for the separator).
   In one embodiment the step of forming the sample may comprise pressing the
 5 glass panes against the spacer. The pressing may be performed in a press that is
   configured to apply a predetermined pressure to the sample.
   Also disclosed is an apparatus for testing an insulated glass unit sample
   comprising at least two glass panes spaced from one another by a spacer that is
   disposed therebetween. The spacer is adhered to the glass panes by an adhesive.
10 The apparatus comprises a separator, and a drive mechanism for driving the
   separator between the glass panes of the sample.
   As set forth above, the apparatus is not limited to testing a sample that comprises
   only two glass panes. The sample to be tested may comprise more than two (e.g.
   three) glass panes and a corresponding number of spacers.
15 In one embodiment the apparatus may comprise a holder to secure the sample
   whilst the separator is driven between the glass panes.
   In one embodiment the holder may comprise an abutment surface. In use the
   sample may be able to be received between the separator and the abutment
   surface. The separator may be able to be driven towards the abutment surface
20 between the glass panes of the sample.
   In one embodiment the separator may be a wedge. That is, the separator may
   have a generally triangular profile (i.e. having an upper angled surface and a lower
   horizontal surface).
   In one embodiment the drive mechanism may be able to move the separator at a
25 generally constant speed when driving the separator between the glass panes.
   In one embodiment the drive mechanism may be able to apply a generally
   constant force to the separator when driving the separator between the panes.

   9722039_1 (GHMatters) P103280.AU.1

   In one embodiment the drive mechanism may be a screw drive. A screw of the
   screw drive may be rotatable by hand, or by e.g. a motor in order to move the
   separator in a linear direction. The motor may be a pneumatic drive motor or a
   stepper motor.
 5 Also disclosed is an insulated glass unit sample comprising at least two glass
   panes spaced from one another by a spacer that is disposed therebetween. The
   spacer is adhered to the glass panes by an adhesive and extends around a portion
   of a periphery of the glass panes. In this way, the spacer defines a sealed portion
   of the periphery, and an open portion of the periphery defining an opening to the
10 space between the glass panes (e.g. for receipt of a separator when used with the
   method and apparatus as set forth above).
   As above, the insulated glass unit sample may comprise additional (e.g. three)
   glass panes and additional spacers.
   In one embodiment the spacer may extend beyond the periphery of the glass panes
15 to form a handle. This handle may be removed prior to testing using the sample
   in order to allow access to the space between the glass panes.
   Also disclosed is a testing system for testing an insulated glass unit sample
   comprising at least two glass panes spaced from one another by a spacer that is
   disposed therebetween. The spacer is adhered to the glass panes by an adhesive.
20 The system comprises a test apparatus as otherwise described above, and a press
   for pressing the sample to prepare the sample to be tested using the test apparatus.
   In one embodiment the press comprises an abutment surface, a press plate, and a
   press mechanism to move the press plate so as to press the sample between the
   press plate and the abutment surface.
25 In one embodiment the press mechanism may be configured to apply a
   predetermined pressure to the sample.
   In one embodiment the press mechanism may be a hydraulic ram.
                                              4
   9722039_1 (GHMatters) P103280.AU.1

   In one embodiment, the press may further comprise a housing. The housing may
   contain the sample while it is pressed. The housing may comprise an opening for
   receipt of the sample into the housing. An entrance to the opening may be spaced
   from the press mechanism so as to e.g. prevent a user from placing their fingers
 5 between the press mechanism and the abutment surface. To accommodate this
   spacing, the press may further comprise an ejection means to eject the sample
   from the housing. The ejection means may be in the form of a pneumatic drive
   that may, for example, push a sample through the opening in the housing once the
   pressing operation has been performed. This may be an automatic process (i.e.
10 the ejection means may automatically be engaged once the pressing operation has
   completed), or it may be a manual process (i.e. where the ejection means is
   actuated by e.g. a button press).
   Also disclosed herein is a method for preparing for inspection an insulated glass
   unit sample. The sample comprises at least two glass panes spaced from one
15 another by a spacer that is disposed therebetween. The spacer is adhered to the
   glass panes by an adhesive. The method comprises driving a separator between
   the glass panes to at least partially separate at least one of the glass panes from the
   spacer.
   The method may be as otherwise set forth above.

                                      DETAILED DESCRIPTION
   In the following detailed description, reference is made to accompanying
 5 drawings which form a part of the detailed description. The illustrative
   embodiments described in the detailed description, depicted in the drawings and
   defined in the claims, are not intended to be limiting. Other embodiments may be
   utilised and other changes may be made without departing from the spirit or scope
   of the subject matter presented. It will be readily understood that the aspects of
10 the present disclosure, as generally described herein and illustrated in the
   drawings can be arranged, substituted, combined, separated and designed in a
   wide variety of different configurations, all of which are contemplated in this
   disclosure.
   Disclosed herein is an insulated glass unit (IGU) sample 100 comprising two glass
15 panes 102 spaced from one another by a spacer 104. The IGU sample 100 may
   comprise three or more panes, with adjacent panes spaced from one another by a
   respective spacer.
   As is apparent from Figure IC, the spacer 104 is disposed between the glass panes
    102, and adhered to the glass panes 102 by adhesive in the form of a butyl
20 adhesive 106 (e.g. polyisobutylene). In particular, layers of adhesive 106 are
   applied to opposing surfaces of the spacer 104 (by way of an automatic or manual
   butyl applicator) to fix those surfaces to the glass panes 102 that are positioned
   adjacent those surfaces.
   In the illustrated embodiment, the glass panes 102 both have the same shape
25 (square) and size (approximately 350 mm x 350 mm). The panes 102 are aligned
   with one another and are generally parallel such that the spacing therebetween is
   generally consistent.
                                                 6
   9722039_1 (GHMatters) P103280.AU.1

   The spacer 104 is in the form of an aluminium profile having a generally D
   shaped cross-section (see Figure IC). The spacer may alternatively be formed of
   plastic or a structural foam. The spacer 104 is bent by approximately 900 at four
   points along its length and the free ends are joined so as to form the spacer 104
 5 into a generally rectangular shape. In this way, the spacer 104 comprises first 108
   and second 110 opposing side sections and first 112 and second 114 opposing end
   sections extending between the side sections 108, 110. One end 116 of the spacer
   (i.e. comprising a portion of each side section 108, 110 and the first end section
    112) is sandwiched between the two glass panes 102. The spacer 104 is
10 positioned such that the side sections 108, 110 and first end section 112 are
   generally parallel, and spaced from, corresponding edges of the glass panes 102.
   In other words, the two side sections 108, 110 and first end section 112 of the
   spacer 104 extend along a periphery of the glass panes 102 so as to define a sealed
   portion 118 of the periphery. A remaining side of the glass panes 102, along
15 which the spacer 104 does not extend, is left open (i.e. such that there is an
   opening 120 in the periphery to the space between the glass panes)
   The end 122 of the spacer 104 that is not sandwiched or connected between the
   glass panes 102 (i.e. a portion of each side section 108, 110 and the second end
   section 114) extends beyond the glass panes 102 so as to form a generally U
20 shaped portion that can define a handle portion and be used by an operator to
   handle the sample. As will be explained in more detail below with reference to
   Figure 3, this handle portion is cut off prior to testing the sample 100, in order to
   allow access to the open portion 120 of the periphery.
   Figures 2A and 2B show an apparatus 224 for testing an insulated glass unit
25 sample 200 as described above and shown in Figures 1A, lB and IC. The
   apparatus 224 comprises a separator in the form of a wedge 226 (i.e. having a
   triangular cross-section), a drive mechanism in the form of a screw drive 228 and
   a holder 230.
                                              7
   9722039_1 (GHMatters) P103280.AU.1

   The holder 230 comprises a rectangular base 232 for receipt of the sample 200
   thereon, and three sidewalls 234 extending around three sides of the base 232.
   The sidewalls 234 define a recess 236 that corresponds to the shape of the sample
   200 so that the sample 200 can be received in the recess in a close-fitting (e.g.
 5 snug) manner. The remaining side of the base 232, which does not have a
   corresponding sidewall, defines an open end of the holder 230 (and the recess
   236). Guides 238 are positioned at this open end of the holder 230 to guide the
   wedge 226 into the recess 236.
   The wedge 226 is positioned at this open end of the holder 230 and is oriented so
10 as to have a base surface 240 that is parallel to the base 232 of the holder 230.
   The base surface 240 of the wedge 226 is spaced from the base 232 of the holder
   230 by a distance that is approximately the thickness of the lower glass pane 202
   in the sample 200 (i.e. when resting on the base 232 of the holder 230). This
   spacing from the base 232 allows the wedge 226 to move over the lower glass
15 pane 202 and into the space formed between the panes 202.
   An upper surface 242 of the wedge 226 defines an acute angle with the base
   surface 240. In use, this upper angled surface 240 contacts an edge of the upper
   glass pane 202 of the sample 200 so as to urge and lift the upper glass pane 202
   away from the spacer 204 of the sample 200. As the wedge 226 moves further
20 into the space between the glass panes 202, it further separates the panes 202.
   This lifting is caused by the wedge 226 being driven between the two glass panes
   202 of the sample 200. As set forth above, the wedge 226 is driven by a screw
   drive 228 (i.e. similar to that of a vice). The screw drive 228 comprises a
   threaded rod 244 (i.e. the screw) connected to a handle 246 at a first end, and
25 connected to the wedge 226 at a second end. The handle 246 can be rotated to
   move the rod 244, and therefore the wedge 226, towards the holder 230.
   In use, a sample 200 is received in the recess 236 of the holder 230 so as to be
   positioned between a wall of the holder (defining an abutment surface 248) and
   the wedge 226. The wedge 226 can then be moved towards the sample 200, and
                                               8
   9722039_1 (GHMatters) P103280.AU.1

   between the two glass panes 202 of the sample 200. Further movement of the
   wedge 226 causes a back edge of the sample 200 to abut against the abutment
   surface 248 of the holder 230 and a front edge of the upper glass pane 202 to
   contact the angled surface 242 of the wedge 226. The angled surface 242 of the
 5 wedge 226 forces the upper glass pane 202 upwards and away from the lower
   glass pane 202 and the spacer. This causes portions of one or both of the glass
   panes 202 to be separated from the spacer 204.
   This separation of the glass panes 202 forms part of the method 350 for testing an
   IGU sample for acceptable adhesion as shown in Figure 3 and as is described
10 below.
   The testing method 350 begins by forming the sample. This includes selecting
   glass panes for the sample 352. Preferably, these glass panes are square and have
   the same (or similar) dimensions. The operator may then clean the glass panes to
   ensure there is no dirt, oil or other contaminants on the surfaces of the glass panes.
15 The operator then selects a spacer 354, which is in the form of a pre-bent bar. The
   shape of the spacer should generally correspond to the selected glass panes. The
   operator may also clean the spacer, before applying an adhesive, such as a butyl
   adhesive (e.g. polyisobutylene) to the spacer 356. This application of adhesive
   may be performed by a machine, or manually (e.g. by using a butyl applicator) or
20 a combination of both, such that adhesive is only applied to three sides of the
   spacer.
   Once the adhesive is applied, the spacer is attached to one of the glass panes 358,
   such that it generally extends along a portion of the periphery of the glass pane.
   In particular, the spacer is positioned such that the three edges having adhesive
25 thereon extend along three corresponding edges of the glass pane, but are offset
   inwardly a small distance from these edges.
   The remaining glass pane is then positioned over, and attached to, the spacer so as
   to align with the glass pane already affixed to the spacer 360. In order to ensure
   that the glass panes are suitably adhered to the spacer, pressure is applied to the
                                              9
   9722039_1 (GHMatters) P103280.AU.1

   assembly 362. This may be performed manually - for example, by way of a plate
   having handles being used to press the assembly against a work surface.
   Alternatively, a pressure applying apparatus may be used to apply a pressure to
   the assembly. An example of such an apparatus 474 is shown in Figure 4. The
 5 apparatus 474 may generally operate in the same (or a similar) way to a machine
   (i.e. primary seal press) used during the process of forming IGU' s. That isthe
   apparatus 474 may simulate how an IGU is formed in practice. In this respect, the
   apparatus 474 comprises a sample holder 476, a hydraulic or electric ram 478, and
   a press plate 480 mounted to the ram 478. The apparatus 474 also comprises a
10 transparent protective cover 482 (or housing) which allows the sample to be
   viewed whilst it is being pressed. The protective cover 482 comprises an opening
   484 to allow access to the holder 476 (i.e. so a sample can be positioned in the
   holder 476). The holder 476 and press plate 480 both comprise a polymeric (e.g.
   closed-cell) foam lining to cushion and protect the sample during the pressing
15 operation.
   In use, a sample is positioned in the holder 476, and the ram 478 is actuated to
   press the sample between the press plate 480 and the holder 474. Although not
   apparent from the figures, the ram 478 is configured to achieve a predetermined
   pressure in order to ensure consistency between samples, and to provide an
20 appropriate simulation of an IGU press.
   Returning now to Figure 3, using the apparatus 474, or the manual method, a
   sample is produced that is the same or similar to that shown in Figures 1A, 1B and
    IC. Once produced, the sample is left for a period of time to ensure that the
   adhesive has cured, and is then positioned in the holder of a testing apparatus 366
25 (as described above) in preparation for testing of the sample. However, at some
   point before testing, the portion of the spacer that protrudes from the glass panes
   must be removed (e.g. by cutting) 364. This may mean removing the end section
   of the spacer off, or the entire protruding handle portion may be removed. This
                                              10
   9722039_1 (GHMatters) P103280.AU.1

   allows the sample to be positioned in the apparatus, and allows for testing to be
   performed on the sample.
   To test the sample, the apparatus is operated in the same way as is described
   above. The separator is driven between the glass panes of the sample 368 to
 5 separate at least one of the glass panes from the separator.
   Once separated, the sample is inspected by an operator 370. Alternatively,
   inspection could be automated, using an optometric-type inspection apparatus.
   For an operator inspection, the operator checks the sample to see whether
   adhesive remains on both the spacer and the glass panes. In other words, the
10 operator checks whether it was the layer of adhesive itself that failed (to allow
   separation), or whether it was the adhesion of the adhesive to the glass panes or
   spacer that lead to separation of the sample. Where there is adhesive on both the
   glass panes and the spacer it is indicative that adhesion of the adhesive to those
   components is satisfactory, and the sample is recorded as a pass 372.
15 On the other hand, where adhesive does not remain on one of the glass panes or
   spacer, the sample is deemed to be a failed sample. In practice, if a sample fails, it
   may be indicative of issues or problems with a batch of adhesive, and that batch of
   adhesive may be removed from the IGU forming line. Similarly, any IGU' s
   produced using that batch of adhesive may need to be inspected or re-formed.
20 Variations and modifications may be made to the parts previously described
   without departing from the spirit or ambit of the disclosure.
   For example, the embodiment above refers to a butyl type adhesive, but the test
   method and apparatus may be suitable for various other types of adhesives used to
   form an IGU.
25 The above description refers to a 350 mm x 350 mm sample size. However, the
   glass panes may take other shapes and sizes suitable for testing. If necessary, full
   size IGU's may be tested. In order to accommodate a range of sizes, the holder
   and wedge of the apparatus may be replaceable.

   As set forth above, although the IGU sample shown and described comprises only
   two glass panes, the IGU sample can comprise more than two (e.g. three) glass
   panes. Where the sample comprises three glass panes (a so-called triple-glazed
   IGU), the method of testing the sample may be performed by driving the separator
 5 between a first outer pane and the middle pane, and then the sample can be turned
   over and the separator can be driven between a second opposing outer pane and
   the middle pane.
   Although not shown in Figures 4A and 4B, the press may further comprise a
   guard disposed at the opening. The guard may effectively space the entrance of
10 the opening further from the press mechanism. This may prevent an operator
   from placing their fingers between the press mechanism and the abutment surface.
   The press may further comprise an ejection means (such as a pneumatic drive) for
   ejecting the sample from the housing.
   In the claims which follow and in the preceding description of the invention,
15 except where the context requires otherwise due to express language or necessary
   implication, the word "comprise" or variations such as "comprises" or
   "comprising" is used in an inclusive sense, i.e. to specify the presence of the
   stated features but not to preclude the presence or addition of further features in
   various embodiments of the invention.
