FUEL TANK FOR STRADDLE TYPE VEHICLE
BACKGROUND
[0001]   This is a divisional application of Australian Patent Application No. <removed-apn>, the
disclosure of which is incorporated in this divisional application in its entirety by reference.
TECHNICAL FIELD
[0002]   The present invention relates to a fuel tank for a straddle type vehicle which is split into
two upper and lower parts in the vertical direction.
BACKGROUND ART
[0003]   There is disclosed a structure which includes a head pipe, a pair of left and right main
frames extending rearwardly from the head pipe while being spaced apart from each other in the
vehicle width direction, a cross member extending between the left and right main frames, and a
fuel tank arranged in a space surrounded with the left and right main frames and the cross
member, wherein the fuel tank is split into two upper and lower parts, and a mating surface
between the upper and lower parts of the fuel tank is located in the vicinity of upper ends of the
main frames (for example, see a patent reference 1).
[0004]   Patent reference 1: Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open Publication No. H08-34379.
[0005]   In the fuel tank split in the vertical direction, a suitable arrangement of a fuel pump is
desired when the fuel pump is arranged within the fuel tank.
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION
[0006]   It is an object of the present invention to at least substantially satisfy the above desire.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
[0007]   In accordance with the present invention, there is provided a fuel tank of a straddle type
vehicle comprising vertically split upper tank and lower tank which have mating portions joined

                                                   2
by welding, the mating portions being arranged to extend along an upper part of a pair of left
and right frame members which is inclined so as to extend in a forward and rearward direction, a
fuel pump being arranged in an interior of the fuel tank through an opening provided in the
lower tank, and a lid member being provided in the fuel pump so as to close the opening,
wherein the lower tank is provided with a substantially horizontal bottom plate, and the bottom
plate has the opening which is located on a lower side in an inclined direction of the frame
members.
[0008]    In the above structure, the upper tank is provided with a downwardly extending wall
which extends toward the mating portions on the lower side in the inclined direction. The fuel
pump is arranged to extend upwardly in a vertical direction from the opening.         An upper end of
the fuel pump is located above the mating portions in a side view.       A seat located in the rear of
the downwardly extending wall is supported on an upper surface of the upper tank.
[0009]    Further, in the above structure, the frame members comprise main frames which extend
downwardly to the rear while spreading left and right from the head pipe.
[0010]    Further, in the above structure, the upper tank and the lower tank are cut out of a
titanium plate member and molded by press-molding.
[0011]    Further, in the above structure, the fuel tank is formed in substantially a rectangular
shape in a side view, and the mating portions are arranged to extend from a front upper part to a
rear lower part of the rectangular shape.
[0012]    Further, in the above structure, the fuel tank has a filler cap which is arranged in an
upper part of the upper tank, and a convex portion which is provided between the filler cap and
the seat.
[0013]    Since the lower tank of the present invention is provided with the substantially
horizontal bottom plate, and the bottom plate has the opening which is located on the lower side
in the inclined direction of the frame members, fuel around the fuel pump can be sucked in
evenly by having the fuel pump arranged on the substantially horizontal bottom plate, and the
fuel which is collected below the fuel pump can be reduced. Moreover, since the opening into
which the fuel pump is fitted is located on the lower side in the inclined direction on which a
distance between each of the mating portions and the substantially horizontal bottom plate gets

                                                    3
closer, and the opening is covered with the lid member of the fuel pump having a heavy load,
the fuel pump can be arranged close to the mating portions. Even if an excessive load has acted
on the fuel tank when a vehicle jumps for example, the mating portions easily receive the load,
and the load acting on the mating portions can be decreased, so that the fuel pump can be
arranged suitably within the fuel tank.
[0014]    Further, the upper tank is provided with the downwardly extending wall which extends
toward the mating portions on the lower side in the inclined direction. The fuel pump is arranged
to extend upwardly in the vertical direction from the opening. The upper end of the fuel pump is
located above the mating portions in a side view. The seat located in the rear of the downwardly
extending wall is supported on the upper surface of the upper tank. Therefore, a capacity of the
fuel tank can be increased, and at the same time, the seat can be supported at a predetermined
height.
[0015]    Further, since the frame members comprise the main frames which extend downwardly
to the rear while spreading left and right from the head pipe, the fuel pump is configured to be
arranged between the downwardly rearwardly inclined main frames and on the wider rear part
sides of the left and right main frames, so that lateral walls of the fuel tank located close to the
fuel pump can be prevented from interfering with the main frames.
[0016]    Further, since the upper tank and the lower tank are cut out of a titanium plate member
and molded by press-molding, a light titanium material is used for the fuel tank which is located
at a higher position than the frame members, so that weight can be reduced in an upper part of
the vehicle body so as to be able to concentrate mass.
[0017]    Further, since the fuel tank is formed in substantially a rectangular shape in a side view,
and the mating portions are arranged to extend from the front upper part to the rear lower part of
the rectangular shape, the weld length of the mating portions is made longer, and the load of the
large capacity fuel tank which is provided with the heavy fuel pump can be supported by the
frame members in a good condition.
[0018]    Further, since the fuel tank has the filler cap which is arranged in the upper part of the
upper tank, and the convex portion which is provided between the filler cap and the seat, a
weight shift movement of the rider can be performed smoothly without being influenced by the
projection of the filler cap.

[0032]    The vehicle body frame 11 includes a head pipe 21, a pair of left and right main frames
22, a pair of left and right center frames 23, a pair of left and right seat frames 24, a down frame
26, a pair of left and right lower frames 27, and a pair of left and right sub-frames 28.
[0033]    The head pipe 21 constitutes the front end portion of the vehicle body frame 11 and
supports the front fork 12 thereon in a steerable fashion. The left and right main frames 22 (see
also FIG. 3) extend from an upper part of the head pipe2l obliquely downwardly to the rear on
the left and right sides such that a distance between the left and right main frames 22 is spaced
apart from each other with approach toward the rear, and are configured to support thereon a
seat 17 and a fuel tank 31 arranged in front of the seat 17. The center frames 23 extend from rear
end portions of the main frames 22 obliquely downwardly to the rear and are curved
substantially downwardly. A pivot shaft 33 which swingably supports a front end portion of the
swing arm 14 extends between the left and right center frames 23.
[0034]    The seat frames 24 extend from upper ends of the left and right center frames 23
obliquely upwardly to the rear so as to support the seat 17 on the upper sides thereof. The down
frame 26 extends substantially downwardly from a lower part of the head pipe 12. The left and
right lower frames 27 extend downwardly left and right from a lower end portion of the down
frame 26 and then are directed toward the rear so as to be connected to lower end portions of the
left and right center frames 23 respectively. The sub-frames 28 extend from the left and right
center frames 23 obliquely upwardly to the rear, and each of rear end portions of the sub-frames
28 is connected to each of the left and right seat frames 24.
[0035]    An engine 35 is supported by the left and right center frames 23, the down frame 26

                                                  6
and the left and right lower frames 27.
[0036]    A bar handle 37 is supported on an upper end portion of the front fork 12 and the front
wheel 13 is carried on a lower end portion of the front fork 12 through a front wheel axle 39.
[0037]    The engine 35 includes a crankcase 41 and a cylinder section 42 which extends
upwardly from a front upper part of the crankcase 41.
[0038]    A transmission 44 is provided integral with a rear part of the crankcase 41. A drive
sprocket 47 is mounted on an output shaft 46 of the transmission 44, and a chain 49 is bridged
between and wrapped around the drive sprocket 47 and a driven sprocket 48 which is provided
integral with the rear wheel 16. Moreover, the transmission 44 includes a gear change pedal 51
which is arranged on a left lateral side of a lower part of the crankcase 41 in order that the driver
performs gear shift operation.
[0039]    The cylinder section 42 includes a cylinder head 53. An intake device (not shown) is
connected to a rear part of the cylinder head 53, and an exhaust device 55 is connected to a front
part thereof. The exhaust device 55 includes an exhaust pipe 57 connected to the cylinder head
53, and a muffler 58 connected to a rear end portion of the exhaust pipe 57.
[0040]    In a front lower part of the vehicle body there is arranged an engine guard 61 which
covers the engine 35 and the left and right lower frames 27 from front and from below.
[0041]    By the way, in the drawing, a reference character 65 designates a front fender which
covers the front wheel 13 from above, 66 a pair of left and right shrouds which covers from
lateral sides the main frames 22 located on a front upper side of the vehicle body and the down
frame 26, and 67 a rear fender which covers the rear wheel 16 from above.
[0042]    FIG. 2 is a side view showing the fuel tank and its environs.
[0043]    The fuel tank 31 is a receptacle of a substantially rectangular shape in a side view
which is formed by joining an upper tank 3 1U and a lower tank 31 L in an upward and
downward direction. In a position of one of diagonal lines (a downwardly rearwardly extending
diagonal line which connects a front upper part and a rear lower part of the rectangular shape) of
the rectangular shape, there are provided flanges 31 a which form mating portions between the

                                                   7
upper tank 31U and the lower tank 31L. A front end portion and a rear end portion of each of the
flanges 31 a are elastically supported on and fixedly secured to the left and right main frames 22
or the surrounding members of the main frames 22 through an elastic member (rubber).
Hereinafter, the main frames 22 on which the flanges 31 a are elastically supported, or the
surrounding members of the main frames 22 on which the flanges 31 a are elastically supported
are referred to as the main frame 22 side.
[0044]    A reference character 71 designates bolts for fastening the flanges 31 a to the main
frames 22 through elastic members.
[0045] An upper surface 22a of the main frame 22 is formed as a rearwardly downwardly
extending flat surface, and the flanges 31 a are arranged spaced apart from the upper surface 22a
and extend in parallel with the upper surface 22a.
[0046]    The upper tank 31U has a filler opening 31b which projects upwardly from the front
upper part of the upper tank 31U and a seat engaging portion 31c formed at a rear upper part of
the upper tank 3 1U so as to be engaged with a front end bottom portion of the seat 17 to support
the seat 17. The filler opening 31b is closed by a filler cap 72.
[0047]    The lower tank 31L has a bottom front part which projects downwardly below the main
frame 22 and a bottom rear part on which a fuel pump 73 is fixed. A pump main body section
73b (see FIG. 4) of the fuel pump 73 is built in the fuel tank 31.
[0048]    In the drawing, a reference character 81 designates radiators which are arranged on
both left and right sides of the down frame 26, 82 designates a head cover for covering an upper
opening of the cylinder head 53, 83 designates an engine hanger which is mounted on an upper
end portion of the center frame 23 so as to support the cylinder section 42 thereon, and 84
designates a pair of left and right reinforcing frames which provides a connection between the
main frame 22 and the down frame 26.
[0049]    FIG. 3 is a view showing the fuel tank 31 and its environs as seen from an upper side in
the axial direction of the head pipe 21.
[0050]    The left and right main frames 22, 22 spread laterally in the obliquely rearward
direction from the head pipe 21 and extend rearwardly respectively with approach toward rear

                                                     8
end portions thereof. Herein, a reference character 87 designates a cross frame for connecting
the left and right center frames 23, 23, which extends in the vehicle width direction.
[0051]     Each of the upper tank 31U and the lower tank 31L of the fuel tank 31 (see FIG. 2) has
a side view shape extending along the main frame 22, and the lower tank 31 L is interposed
between the left and right main frames 22, 22.
[0052]     Each of the flanges 31a has a front end which is fixed in a middle position in the
vehicle width direction and a rear end which is fixed in two positions spaced apart from each
other in the vehicle width direction.
[0053]     The fuel pump 73 is provided in the widest portion in the vehicle width direction of a
rear part of the lower tank 31L.
[0054]     FIG. 4 is a left side view of the fuel tank 31. Herein, the flanges 31a of the fuel tank 31
are depicted in such a way as to enlarge its thickness in order for easily grasping its shape.
[0055]     With respect to the fuel tank 31, an annular upper flange portion 31d which is formed
in a flat plate shape at a lower end of the upper tank 3 1U and an annular lower flange portion
31e which is formed in a flat plate shape at an upper end of the lower tank 31L are joined
together by electric resistance welding (seam welding). The upper flange portion 3 1d and the
lower flange portion 31 e constitute the flanges 31 a.
[0056]     The upper tank 31U and the lower tank 31L are molded by press-molding from blank
materials of titanium which are cut into flat plates.
[0057]     The fuel tank 31 is formed in a rectangular shape in a side view, and each of the flanges
31 a is formed in such a way as to extend substantially along the downwardly rearwardly
extending diagonal line which is one of diagonal lines of the rectangle. Namely, the upper tank
3 1U and the lower tank 3 1L are formed such that one of these tanks overlaps with the other
when the one is rotated 1800. Accordingly, the blank materials before press-molding the upper
tank 3 1U and the lower tank 3 1L can be formed in the same shape, and costs can be reduced by
sharing the blank materials of the same shape.
[0058]     The upper tank 31U includes an upper wall 31f, left and right lateral walls 31g, and a

                                                    9
rear wall 31h.
[0059]     The upper wall 31f is integrally formed with the filler opening 31b of cylindrical shape
in which a male screw portion 3 1j is formed, and an upwardly projecting convex portion 31k
formed in the rear of the filler opening 3 1b and in front of the seat engaging portion 3 1c. The
convex portion 31k, as shown in FIG. 2, is located forwardly of the seat 17 and formed
substantially at the same level with a height of a front end portion of the seat 17. Therefore,
when the driver has moved forwardly of a front end of the seat 17, the driver can smoothly get
over the filler opening 3 lb on which the filler cap 72 is mounted, in the forward direction.
[0060]     Referring again to FIG. 4, the rear wall 31h extends substantially vertically upward
from the upper flange 31 d.
[0061]     The lower tank 31L includes a front wall 31m, left and right lateral walls 31n, and a
bottom wall 31p. The front wall 3 1m extends substantially vertically downward from the lower
flange 3 1e. The bottom wall 31p has a rear part formed substantially horizontally, and the fuel
pump 73 is mounted on the substantially horizontal rear part.
[0062]     The fuel pump 73 includes a pump flange section 73a which is mounted on the bottom
wall 31p of the lower tank 3 1L, and a pump main body section 73b which extends upwardly
from the pump flange section 73a.
[0063]     The pump main body section 73b includes a motor for generating motive power, a filter
for filtrating the fuel, and others.
[0064]     FIG. 5 is a bottom view of the fuel tank 31.
[0065]     The lower tank 3 1L of the fuel tank 31 is formed with a substantially horizontal flat
portion 31q of a circular shape in the rear part of the bottom wall 3lp. The flat portion 31q is a
portion which is located in an inward side of the fuel tank 31 from a circumference thereof, and
a circular opening 31 r into which the pump main body section 73b of the fuel pump 73 is
inserted is formed in a middle of the flat portion 31 q. Moreover, to the flat portion 31 q located
in a circumference of the opening 3 1r there are joined a plurality of bolt supporting members 92
of circular arc shape each of which is provided with a plurality of stud bolts 91 for fastening the
pump flange section 73a of the fuel pump 73. The stud bolts 91 are fitted into bolt insertion

                                                   10
holes (not shown) provided on the pump flange section 73a, and nuts are screw-threaded into
and fastened to distal ends of the stud bolts 91, so that the fuel pump 73 is fixedly secured to the
lower tank 31L.
[0066]    In the drawing, a reference characters 31s designates a tank rear part fixing section
formed in the rear end portion of the flanges 31 a in order for mounting the fuel tank 31 on the
main frame 22 side (see FIG. 1), and 3 1t designates a bolt insertion hole into which a bolt for
mounting the tank rear part fixing section 31s is inserted. By the way, a tank front part fixing
section 3 1u (see FIG. 3) for mounting the front end portions of the flanges 3 1a on the main
frame 22 side is invisible in a bottom view since it overlaps with a front part of the lower tank
31L.
[0067]    FIG. 6 is a cross sectional view taken on line VI-VI of FIG. 5. FIG. 7 is an enlarged
view of an essential part of FIG. 6.
[0068]    As shown in FIGS. 6 and 7, the opening 31r provided in the flat portion 31q of the
lower tank 3 1L is formed by an annular wall portion 3 1v formed integral with the flat portion
31 q. Like this, since the opening 31 r is not a simple opening and is formed by the annular wall
portion 3 1v, the annular wall portion 3 1v serves as a reinforcing rib so that the opening 3 1r can
be reinforced.
[0069]    The flat portion 31q is formed in a higher position than a circumferential part thereof.
With this structure, since lower end positions of the stud bolts 91 provided on the flat portion
31q are able to be located in a higher position, the engine 35 (see FIG. 1) located below the fuel
tank 31 can be located in a higher position. As a result, a minimum ground clearance of the
engine 35 can be heightened. At the same time, since the circumferential part of the flat portion
31q is lowered, it is possible to ensure a capacity of the fuel tank 31.
[0070]    FIG. 8 is a left side view schematically showing the fuel tank 31 together with the main
frame 22. Triangular marks in the drawings are fuel tank support portions 95, 96 on the side of
vehicle body frame 11 and correspond to the bolts 71 (see FIG. 2) for fastening the flanges 31 a.
[0071]    The upper tank 31U has the rear wall 31h which extends substantially vertically toward
the flanges 31 a, and the lower tank 31 L has the front wall 31 m which extends substantially
vertically toward the flanges 31 a.

                                                    11
[0072]    When the vehicle has made a landing after jumping, for example, a load due to the
weight of the fuel and the fuel pump 73 within the fuel tank 31 and the acceleration at the time
of landing acts downward on the lower tank 3 1L.
[0073]    Apart of this load acts on the front wall 31m of the lower tank 31L as tensile force. For
example, if the front wall 31 m is inclined with respect to a vertical plane, bending force acting
on the front wall 3 1m is increased whereby deformation or the like is produced. As compared
with this, the substantially vertical front wall 3 1m is able to support the load so as to suppress
the deformation or the like.
[0074]    Further, although the downward load acting on the fuel pump 73 has a moment around
the fuel tank support portion 96 generated in the fuel tank 31, the moment can be made smaller
since the fuel pump 73 is arranged in the vicinity of the fuel tank support portion 96 located on
the lower side in the inclined direction of the flanges 31 a. Namely, the load acting on the flanges
31 a may be decreased.
[0075]    In addition, in a side view, a joining portion 97 (a portion shown by a black dot)
between the flange 31a and the upper wall 31f of the upper tank 31U corresponds substantially
to ajoining portion between the flange 31a and the front wall 31m of the lower tank 31L.
Similarly, in a side view, a joining portion 98 (a portion shown by a black dot) between the
flange 31a and the rear wall 31h of the upper tank 31U corresponds substantially to the flange
31a and the bottom wall 31p of the lower tank 31L. With provision of the substantially
corresponding joining portions 97, 98 between the upper tank 3 1U and the lower tank 31 L in
this manner, each of blank materials for the upper tank 31U and the lower tank 31L can be
formed in the same shape. Accordingly, in comparison with the case where the blank material
for the upper tank 3 1U is different from the blank material for the lower tanks 3 1L, a useless
part can be lessened and costs can be reduced.
[0076]    As shown in FIGS 2, 4, 5 and 7, the fuel tank 31 of the straddle type vehicle comprises
the vertically split upper tank 3 1U and lower tank 3 IL which have the flanges 3 1a as the mating
portions joined by welding. The flanges 31 a are arranged to extend along the upper parts of the
main frames 22 as the pair of left and right frame members which is inclined so as to extend in
the forward and rearward direction. The fuel pump 73 is arranged in the interior of the fuel tank
31 through the opening 3 1r provided in the lower tank 13L, and the pump flange section 73a as

                                                    12
the lid member is provided in the fuel pump 73 so as to close the opening 3 1r. The lower tank
3 1L is provided with the bottom wall 31p formed as a substantially horizontal bottom plate, and
the bottom wall 31p has the opening 3 1r which is located on the lower side in the inclined
direction of the main frames 22.
[0077]    With the above structure, since the fuel pump 73 is arranged on the substantially
horizontal bottom plate 3ip (in detail, the flat portion 31 q), the fuel around the fuel pump 73 can
be sucked in evenly and the fuel collected below the fuel pump 73 can be reduced. Moreover,
since the opening 3 1r into which the fuel pump 73 is fitted is located on the lower side in the
inclined direction on which a distance between each of the flanges 31 a and the substantially
horizontal flat portion 31 q gets closer, and the opening 31 r is covered with the pump flange
section 73a of the fuel pump 73 having a heavy load, the fuel pump 73 can be arranged close to
the flanges 31 a. Therefore, even if an excessive load has acted on the fuel tank 31 when the
vehicle jumps for example, the flanges 31 a easily receive the load, and the load acting on the
flanges 31 a can be decreased, so that the fuel pump 73 can be arranged suitably within the fuel
tank 31.
[0078]    Further, as shown in FIGS, 2, 4 and 6, the upper tank 31U is provided with the rear wall
31 h formed as a downwardly extending wall which extends toward the flanges 31 a on the lower
side in the inclined direction. The fuel pump 73 is arranged to extend upwardly in the vertical
direction from the opening 31 r. The upper end of the fuel pump 73 is located above the flanges
31a in a side view. The seat 17 located in the rear of the rear wall 31h is supported on the upper
surface of the upper tank 3 1U. Therefore, the capacity of the fuel tank 31 can be increased, and
at the same time the seat 17 can be supported at a predetermined height.
[0079]    Further, as shown in FIGS. 2 and 3, since the frame members comprise the main frames
22 which extend downwardly to the rear while spreading left and right from the head pipe 21,
the fuel pump 73 is configured to be arranged between the downwardly rearwardly inclined
main frames 22 and on the wider rear part sides of the left and right main frames 22, so that the
lateral walls 31 g, 31 n (see FIG. 4) of the fuel tank 31 located close to the fuel pump 73 can be
prevented from interfering with the main frames 22.
[0080]    Further, the upper tank 31U and the lower tank 31L are molded by press-molding from
the blank materials which are cut into the titanium plate members. Thus, the light titanium

                                                  13
material is used for the fuel tank 31 located at a higher position than the main frames 22,
whereby the weight in the upper part of the vehicle body can be reduced and the mass of the
vehicle body can be concentrated.
[0081]    Further, as shown in FIG. 4, since the fuel tank 31 is formed in substantially a
rectangular shape in a side view, and the flanges 31 a are arranged to extend from the front upper
part to the rear lower part of the rectangular shape, the weld lengths of the flanges 31 a are made
longer, and the load of the large capacity fuel tank 31 which is provided with the heavy fuel
pump 73 can be supported by the main frames 22 in a good condition.
[0082]    Further, as shown in FIG. 2, since the fuel tank 31 has the filler cap 72 which is
arranged in the upper part of the upper tank 3 1U, and the convex portion 31k which is provided
between the filler cap 72 and the seat 17, a weight shift movement of the rider can be performed
smoothly without being influenced by the projection of the filler opening 3 lb and the filler cap
72.
Second Embodiment
[0083]    FIG. 9 is a left side view showing a fuel tank 101 and its environs in accordance with a
second embodiment. Like elements are given like reference characters with respect to the
structure corresponding to the first embodiment as shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, and the detailed
explanation will be omitted.
[0084]    The fuel tank 101 is a receptacle formed of an upper tank 101U and a lower tank lOlL
which are vertically combined together. Flanges 101a which are mating portions between the
upper tank 101U and the lower tank lOlL by seam welding have a front part and a rear end
portion thereof which are elastically supported through elastic members (rubbers) on a pair of
left and right rearwardly upwardly inclined seat frames 24. Reference characters 103 designate
bolts for fastening the flanges 101a to the seat frames 24 through the elastic members.
[0085]    An upper surface 24a of the seat frame 24 is formed as a rearwardly upwardly
extending plane surface. The flanges 101a are arranged spaced apart from the upper surfaces 24a
in the upward direction and extend substantially parallel to the upper surfaces 24a.
[0086]    The upper tank 1OU and the lower tank lOlL are molded by press-molding from blank

                                                  14
materials which are cut into titanium flat plates.
[0087]    The upper tank 101U is provided with an upwardly projecting filler opening 101b in a
rear upper part thereof. The filler opening 101b is covered with a filler cap 72. The lower tank
101 L is formed with a substantially horizontal flat portion 101 c in a front bottom part thereof.
An opening (not shown) is formed in the flat portion 101c. The pump main body section 73b of
the fuel pump 73 is inserted into the opening, and the pump flange section 73a of the fuel pump
73 is securely fixed to the flat portion 101c. The pump main body section 73b of the fuel pump
73 is accommodated in the fuel tank 101.
[0088]    Namely, the lower tank 31L has a bottom wall 10le provided with the substantially
horizontal flat portion 101c. In the flat portion 101c, there is formed the opening which is
located on the lower side in the inclined direction of the seat frames 24.
[0089]    It is to be understood that the above described embodiments are to be taken as a
preferred form of the invention and that various changes and modifications may be made in the
invention without departing from the spirit and scope thereof.
[0090]    The present invention may be applied to the straddle type vehicles other than the
