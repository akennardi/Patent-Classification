                                            ****    ****
   FIELD OF THE INVENTION
   The present invention relates to an extended release tablet (ERT), comprising
 5 phentermine or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and one or more of a wax
   and at least a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient selected among one or more of
   a fatty acid, a bulking agent, a lubricant and the like and a process for its
   preparation.
   BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
10 The prevalence of overweight people has reached alarming levels. Also the
   proportion of children and adolescents who are overweight has tripled in the past
   three decades.
   Obesity arises as a consequence of positive caloric balance. A comprehensive
   behavioral approach comprising a gradual increase of energy expenditure from
15 exercise and an appropriate diet to decrease the caloric intake should be the more
   effective treatment of obesity.
   However, this approach has a relatively low success rate. Consequently alternative
   forms of treatment, including surgery and/or medication, have been developed in an
   effort to increase the likelihood of achieving, and maintaining weight loss. In
20 particular pharmacotherapy, in combination with intensive behavioral treatment, can
   lead to clinically significant decreases in body weight in obese population.
   Some US FDA-approved weight-loss drugs are phentermine, sibutramine, orlistat,
   diethylpropion, and lorcaserin. Liraglutide has been also approved for the treatment
   of overweight. Among them, phentermine is more commonly used since it is one of
25 the most efficient and safe in promoting weight loss or in maintaining a healthy body
   weight, especially when given along with recommendations for diet and exercise.
   Phentermine is a sympathomimetic amine which first received approval from the US
   FDA in 1959 as an appetite suppressant for the short-term treatment of exogenous
   obesity for patients with an initial body mass index 230 kg/M 2 , or 227 kg/M  2
                                                                                    in the
30 presence of other risk factors (e.g., hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia).
   Phentermine hydrochloride (a,a-dimethylphenethylamine hydrochloride) became
   available in the United States in the early seventies and is currently sold in several
   dosage forms such as tablets, film coated tablets and capsules.
   WO 2006/104397 discloses a controlled release combination tablet comprising a
   9664097_1 (GHMatters) P107267.AU

                                                -2
   copper antagonist, such as copper chelators, and one or more anorectics, such as
   phentermine maleate,            prepared by roller compaction and direct compression
   methods. However, in such dosage form, nearly 70% of the total weight is occupied
   by the copper antagonist leaving a very small formulation space for the anorectic
 5 and other suitable excipients. Furthermore, the manufacturing process employed is
   not the best suited when lipid excipients are involved.
   Extended release formulations in the form of capsules containing phentermine in
   order to suppress appetite during all the day are marketed in some countries such
   as Australia, New Zealand and South Africa under the trade name Duromine*.
10 Duromine* composition is in the form of granules contained in a hard gelatine
   capsule.
   Duromine* contains an ion exchange resin which reacts with phentermine base
   under specific conditions.
   The ion-exchange resin contained in Duromineois quite stable, highly insoluble and
15 without pharmacological effect until it reacts with cations (hydrogen, potassium,
   sodium etc.) present in the gastrointestinal fluids.
   In particular, the resin contained in Duromine®, after administration and in the
   presence of the ions of the gastrointestinal tract exchanges sodium ions with
   phentermine providing the release of the active ingredient.
20 However, the extended release capsules containing phentermine known in the art,
   such as Duromine*, have several disadvantages.
   In fact, the reaction between the ion exchange resin present in Duromine* and
   phentermine is influenced by the ionic strength in gastrointestinal fluids. Therefore,
   the release and dissolution of phentermine from Duromine* may be different in the
25 same patient at different times and from patient to patient. This variability highly
   impacts on the bioavailability and efficacy of the drug.
   Moreover, since Duromine* is in the form of hard gelatine capsules, said capsules
   cannot be divided, therefore they are not suitable for dose adjustments.
   The marketed tablets containing phentermine are manufactured so as to release
30 phentermine immediately or in short terms.
   However, there is the need of an effective extended release formulation comprising
   phentermine or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof which ensures a constant
   and reproducible release and dissolution of phentermine or a salt thereof and which
   can be administered even only once a day.

                                               -3
   The present invention provides an extended release tablet which solves the
   drawbacks or disadvantages of the extended release formulations comprising
   weight-loss drugs, in particular phentermine or a salt thereof, known in the art.
   Such extended release tablet comprising phentermine or a pharmaceutically
 5 acceptable salt thereof is suitable for administration for longer terms, ensures the
   constant and reproducible release and dissolution of phentermine and its optimal
   efficacy and minimizes the difference or variability of efficacy of the drug among
   patients.

   The extended release tablet according to the present invention can also be coated,
   colored, scored and/or embossed in order to comply with regulatory requirements
   and for patient compliance.
 5 In particular, the tablet can be coated with a colored film for an easier identification.
   Therefore, the extended release tablet according to the present invention can
   optionally comprise one or more pharmaceutically acceptable coloring agents,
   preferably from about 0.01% to about 0.5% of the total weight of the tablet.
   According to a preferred embodiment, the extended release tablet of the present
10 invention is scored and colored in green, red brown or orange.
   More preferably, the extended release tablet according to the present invention has
   a capsule shape, is scored and colored and can be divided following a breaking line
   in two halves and is embossed with an identification code.
   If the case, the extended release tablets of the present invention can be packed in
15 PVC/PVDC or in ALU/ALU blister packs, wherein each blister comprises 10 tablets.
   If the case, the extended release tablets of the present invention can also be packed
   in a bottle, for example a High Density Polyethylene (HDPE) bottle, equipped with a
   child resistant closure (CRC) and/or a tamper-evident seal.
   The extended release tablet according to the present invention can be manufactured
20 according to techniques known in the art.
   In particular, the extended release tablet according to the present invention can be
   manufactured                according to a melting technology, such as sieving,    melting
   granulation, blending and tableting.
   In a preferred embodiment, the manufacturing process of the extended release
25 tablet according to the present invention is disclosed here below.
   The process comprises the steps of:
          a) granulating a mixture comprising phentermine or a salt thereof, a bulking
                agent, a fatty acid and a wax, without using water or other solvents, rising
                the temperature between about 35      0C and about 65 0C;
30        b) compressing the homogenous mixture into a tablet.
   A salt of phentermine is a pharmaceutically acceptable one, preferably the
   hydrochloride salt.
   The bulking agent, fatty acid and wax are as defined above.
   "Without using any solvent" means that the process does not make use of any
   9664097_1 (GHMatter) P107267.AU

                                             -9
   organic or inorganic solvent.
   Optionally, before granulating the mixture at step a), the active ingredient and the
   excipients can be loaded in a high shear mixer.
   Optionally, after the granulation step a) the granulate can be sieved, in particular
 5 through a net of 1 mm net light, and blended with a lubricant, as previously defined,
   in a bin blender.
   The tablets obtained at step b) typically have a content of phentermine or a
   pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof corresponding to 15 mg, 30 mg or 40 mg
   per tablet.
10 The process of the present invention allows to obtain tablets, in particular extended
   release tablets, having a homogeneous distribution of phentermine or salt thereof.
   It should be noticed that the inventors of the present extended release tablet have
   advantageously and surprisingly found that the release and dissolution of
   phentermine or a salt thereof contained in the present tablet is constant and
15 reproducible and it is not influenced by the pH at all. In Example 5 reported here
   below it is shown that the extended release tablet of the present invention is able to
   release phentermine or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, in vitro or in vivo,
   independently from the pH of the dissolution medium.
   Therefore, the release of phentermine or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof
20 from the present extended release tablet can be defined as pH independent and
   ionic strength independent.
   Furthermore, the duration of the release of phentermine or a pharmaceutically
   acceptable salt thereof contained in the extended release tablet of the present
   invention is greater than seven hours.
25 In conclusion, the extended release tablet of the present invention ensures the
   optimal efficacy of phentermine or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and
   minimizes the variability of absorption of the active ingredient among patients so
   achieving a regular and reproducible bioavailability profile, compared to the
   extended release formulations containing phentermine or a pharmaceutically
30 acceptable salt thereof known in the art.
   Moreover, the extended release tablet according to the present invention is stable,
   easy to be administered because it requires just to be swallowed with some water.
   It is therefore another object of the present invention an extended release tablet, as

   thereof independently from the pH of the dissolution medium.
   The advantageous properties of the extended release tablet of the present invention
   make it particularly in compliance with the need of the overweight patients,
   especially children and adolescents, because it can be administered once a day

   It is therefore another object of the present invention an extended release tablet as
   disclosed above for use in the treatment of obesity or overweight in humans,
   preferably in children or adolescents.
   Even if the present invention has been disclosed with reference to a specific
10 pharmaceutical formulation comprising phentermine or a salt thereof, the man
   skilled in the art can also adapt the specific pharmaceutical formulation comprising
   phentermine or a salt thereof of the present invention to analogous weight-loss
   drugs. Therefore,              an analogous pharmaceutical    composition  of the   present
   invention, only differing for the kind of weight-loss drug, is to be considered within
15 the scope of the present invention.
