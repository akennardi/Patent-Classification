                                           TITLE
              "MECHANICAL WEED SEED MANAGEMENT SYSTEM"
                             FIELD OF THE INVENTION
[0001] The present invention relates to a mechanical weed seed management system
 and device for use therewith.
                                      BACKGROUND
[0002] Annually, grain farmers are faced with weeds, for example, ryegrass and radish,
 within their crops. Often, weeds cause huge production losses each harvest. Presently,
 herbicides are used to attempt to control weeds in techniques such as crop-topping: the
 late application of herbicides to prevent weed seed-set in crop. This may reduce grain
 contamination, however crop-topping will not increase yields. Herbicide resistance is
 also making the use of chemicals to control weeds increasingly ineffective.
[0003] Another method of weed control includes careful management of rotation of
 land use.    This involves farming different produce, such as vegetative crop then
 livestock, on alternative areas of land. Rotation methods may also involve not farming
 on a particular land area for one or more seasons. Rotation methods can decrease the
 amount of profitable land available to a farmer in a year and may force the farming of
 less profitable material on the available land.
[0004] Mechanical control of weed seed has also been used by farmers during harvest
 with the use of attachments to harvesting machinery. When plant material, including
 grain and unwanted straw and weed material is harvested, the grain is separated from
 the unwanted waste and collected, while the waste is either spread onto the harvested
 land or compiled into windrows for burning or baling. Whilst the spreading technique
 is almost entirely useless for weed control, the windrows can be somewhat effective.
[0005] Burning windrows has the ability to destroy weed seeds but only if the
 temperature of the burn is high enough. If seeds are dropped to the earth from the
 harvester and an unacceptable amount of straw and other material covers the seed, the
                                              2

 seeds are insulated somewhat from the burn and remain viable. Conversely, baling
 collects the dropped waste material and compiles it into bales for removal from the area
 and use as livestock feed, for example. However, if the ryegrass levels in the crop were
 significant, the baled material will have an unacceptable level of annual ryegrass
 toxicity (ARGT) for direct straw export. Rather, the bales may only be used for pellet
 production.
[0006] An existing accessory for a harvester, known as a chaff top, transports the chaff
 fraction of the waste material, which contains the greatest portion of weed seed, to be
 placed on top of the straw fraction within a windrow. Accordingly, effective burning
 can be achieved and seeds are rendered unviable. However, these accessories have
 been rarely used as they have been found to prevent the smooth flow of material through
 the harvester and cause frequent blockages.
[0007] The present invention attempts to overcome at least in part the aforementioned
 disadvantages of previous mechanical weed seed management systems and devices.
                            SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
[0008] In accordance with one aspect of the present invention there is provided a

 from a harvester;
              a chute for catching, directing and depositing the straw waste to the ground;
              a trough comprising a means for transporting material through its length,
 for catching, transporting and depositing the chaff waste on top of the straw waste on
 the ground,
 wherein the trough is of a depth greater than 150 mm.
[0009] The trough may be of a depth of 310 mm.
[0010] The trough may be of a width of between 250 and 450 mm.
                                               3

[0011] The trough may be of a width of between 275 and 290 mm.
[0012] The trough may be generally triangular with rounded corners in shape.
[0013] The device may further comprise at least one guard abutting a section of the
 trough for assisting in guiding the chaff waste into the trough.
[0014] The at least one guard may be disposed at one or more of: forward of the trough;
 within a middle area of the annular trough, forward of the chute; and above an unroofed
 length of the trough, at respective sides of the device.
[0015] The chute may be tapered inwardly downwards for directing the straw into a
 narrower deposit.
[0016] The width of the chute may be variable for a variable width deposit of straw
 waste on the ground.
[0017] The trough may square shaped in sectional profile.
[0018] The means for transporting material through the length of the trough may
 comprise a paddled chain.
[0019] Each paddle may be dimensioned so as to be of a complementary size and shape
 to the trough.

                 DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
[0025] Referring to the Figures, there is shown a device 10 of a mechanical weed seed
 management system for use with and upon a harvester 12. The device 10 is mounted
 upon the harvester 12 so as to catch and process waste material, such as weed and straw,
 from the harvesting process. Accordingly, the device 10 is generally mounted toward
 the rear of the harvester 12.
[0026] The trough 24 of the device 10 is annular and generally rounded-triangular in
 shape (as best seen in Figure 3), encircling the back of the harvester 12 and reaching to
 an underside of the harvester 12. The trough 24 comprises at least three walls defining
 a volume therein of a depth greater than 150 mm, preferably about 310 mm deep. The
 width of the trough is between about 250 and 450 mm, preferably between 275 and 290
                                              5

 mm. Within the trough 24 is disposed a chain 26 comprising paddles 28 spaced apart
 on links of the chain 26. The height of each paddle 28 is complementary to the depth
 of the trough 24; similarly, the length of each paddle 28 is complementary to the width
 of the trough 24. Preferably, the chain 26 further comprises at least one adjustment link
 for adjusting the tension of the chain 26.
[0027] It is preferred that the cross-sectional profile of the trough 24 is square.
 However, other shaped profiles are contemplated, including but not limited to generally
 square with rounded corners, or half-circular, with a rounded base. In the case of a
 half-circular profile, the paddles may be complementary shaped, for example be formed
 as half-moons.
[0028] The chain 26 is in connection with a drive cog 30, which is, according to a
 preferred embodiment, driven by a hydraulic pump 32 in a usual manner as would be
 understood by the skilled person. The pump 32 is located at an underside of the trough
 24, as best seen in Figure 2. In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present
 invention, the chain 26 is driven to move in an anticlockwise direction through the
 volume defined within the trough 24. It is envisioned that the device 10 is equally as
 capable of operating with the chain 26 being driven to move in a clockwise direction.
[0029] The device 10 may optionally further comprise a camera and other monitoring
 equipment such as alarms. Said equipment may be in connection with the cog 30 or
 chain 26 such that if either integer ceased normal operation, a user would be alerted
 visually or audibly.
[0030] Approximately half the length of the trough 24, positioned toward the rear of
 the device 10 where it exits from the harvester 12, comprises a roof 42 which acts to
 completely enclose the volume defined within the trough 24. The roof 42 comprises
 an access panel 44 removable from the roof 42. The access panel 44 is aligned with
 and located generally above the drive cog 30 for ease of access to the interior of the
 trough 24, chain 26 and said drive cog 30.
                                              6

[0031] Within a floor of the trough 24 is disposed a chaff vent 46 for material within
 the trough 24 to fall through under gravity. According to a preferred embodiment of
 the present invention, the chaff vent 46 comprises a generally rectangular cut-out piece
 from the central rear floor of the trough 24.
[0032] Located generally encircled by the trough 24 is a straw chute 48. The straw
 chute comprises two side walls 52 angled to create a downward taper to the straw chute
 48. The straw chute 48 is open at both its upper and lower ends to allow material to
 fall through the chute 48 under gravity, and also to be selectively directed to fall into a
 narrower width by the taper of the straw chute 48. The width of the chute 48 can be
 varied according to a user's preference or to better suit the crop being harvested.
[0033] Disposed generally above and forward of the straw chute 48 is a plate 54. The
 forward end 56 of the plate 54 is substantially adjoining the floor of the compartment
 of the harvester 12 from where straw waste 68 is disposed. The plate 54 extends from
 its forward end 56 to its back end 58, which is located substantially over the upper end
 of the straw chute 48. Accordingly, the plate 54 acts, in use, to direct straw waste 68
 from the harvester 12 into the straw chute 48.
[0034] Optionally, the device 10 may further comprise a front guard 62. The front
 guard 62 extends forward from the upper edge of the front wall of the trough 24 to the
 underside of the compartment of the harvester 12 from where chaff, weed seeds and
 other fine waste material 70 (hereinafter called "chaff' for ease of description) is
 discharged. Accordingly, the front guard 62 acts, in use, to direct chaff 70 from the
 harvester 12 into the trough 24. The action of the front guard 62 may be further assisted
 by a front flap (not shown), preferably comprising a flexible sheet suspended from an
 underside of the harvester 12 to rest upon the front guard 62.
[0035] A rear guard (not shown) may also be provided on the device 10. The rear guard
 generally encloses the central hole created by the annular shape of the trough 24,
 forward of the chute 48. Hence, the rear guard extends upwards from the upper edge
 of the rear wall of the trough 24 to the underside of the plate 54. To each side, the rear
                                             7

 guard extends along the majority of the unroofed portion of the trough 24. Accordingly,
 very little material entering from the harvester 12 to the trough 24 area is allowed escape
 excepting into the trough 24.
[0036] The device 10 may be provided with left and right side guards 72, as best seen
 in Figure 4. Each side guard 72 is disposed on a respective side of the device 10, curved
 above the trough 24 forward of the roofed portion of the trough 24. The lower, outer
 edge of each side guard 72 abuts the front guard 62, and the upper, inner edge of each
 side guard 72 abuts the harvester 12 so as to further enclose the unroofed portion of the
 trough 24. The rear end of each side guard 72, proximal to the forward roofed portion
 of the trough 24, is truncated so as to allow dust, for example, to escape from the
 guarded areas of the device 10. It has been advantageously found that the curved, open
 shape of the optional side guards 72 act to direct dust out of unwanted areas and
 downwards to the ground and away from the device 10. In addition, the reduction in
 circulating dust provided by the side guards 72 and the effectiveness of the device 10
 generally, render the device 10 and harvester 12 combination capable of operating at
 50 tons of wheat or 15-18 tons of canola per hour while further processing waste 68,
 70 from the harvester 12. The device 10 is operable on a class 9 header, functioning at
 its maximum capability, without blockages or disruptions.
[0037] It is preferred that the guards 62, 72 and rear guard are constructed of a moulded
 plastic. Alternatively, the guards 62, 72 and rear guard may be constructed of a flexible
 plastic so that they assume their preferably shape once in place on the device 10. It is
 preferred that the guards 62, 72 and rear guard are in connection with the device 10
 and/or harvester 12 using magnetism. However, other suitable means for attachment
 of the guards 62, 72 and rear guard may also be used, including but not limited to, rivets,
 studs or latches.
[0038] With particular reference to Figures 4 to 7 and in accordance with a preferred
 embodiment, the device 10 comprises first 14, second 16 and third 18 points of
 attachment. The first point of attachment 14 connects the device 10 to the rear axle of
 the harvester 12 and preferably comprises an axle bracket 34 for mounting onto the axle
                                              8

 and a trough bracket 36 for mounting onto a trough 24 of the device 10 in any suitable
 manner as known. Both the brackets 34, 36 comprise at least one stud receiver 38
 through which, aligned, a stud 40 can pass to complete attachment at the first point of
 attachment 14.
[0039] The second 16 and third 18 points of attachment may comprise at least one strap
 22 each, connecting the trough 24 to suitable locations near the rear of a respective side
 of the harvester 12.
[0040] In use, the weed seed management device 10 is attached to the rear of the
 harvester 12 in such a way so as to further process the waste material exiting the
 harvester 12. The device 10 is attached to the harvester 12 at the first 14, second 16
 and third 18 points of attachment. As would be clear to the skilled person, the stud
 receivers 38, of both the axle bracket 34 and trough bracket 36 of the first point of
 attachment 14, are aligned for the passage of the stud 40 and hence attachment of the
 device 10 to the rear axle of the harvester 12. The straps 22 of the second 16 and third
 18 points of attachment are placed into connection with both the device 10 and the
 harvester 12 by any suitable means including, but not limited to, the use of bolts through
 bolt holes at respective ends of the straps 22.
[0041] The harvester 12 may be used normally in the manner in which it is intended or
 any other way as is desired by the user.        Accordingly, the harvester 12 cuts and
 processes crops, for example, wheat, so that the useable wheat seeds are delivered to a
 storage bin for transport and use, and waste material from the harvesting process, such
 as straw 68 and chaff 70, are disposed of on the harvested land. The normal operation
 of the harvester 12 separates the two waste fractions 68, 70 using weight differences,
 with the lighter straw 68 being blown along a higher path through the harvester than
 the chaff 70.
[0042] The plate 54 of the device 10 acts to continue the separation of the waste
 fractions 68, 70 after their transport through the harvester 12. The longer straw 68 is
 continued to be separated from the chaff by the plate 54 positioned to direct the straw
                                              9

 68 from the harvester 12 to the straw chute 48. The straw 68 moves from the harvester
 12 along the plate 54 to the open upper end of the straw chute 48. As the straw 68 falls
 through the straw chute 48 under the effects of gravity, the tapered side walls 52 of the
 straw chute 48 direct the straw 68 to form a relatively narrow windrow along the
 harvested land from the open lower end of the straw chute 48.
[0043] Meanwhile, the finer chaff 70 is discharged from the harvester 12, from its usual
 exit point, into the trough 24. The front guard 62 and optional front flap assist in
 guiding the chaff 70 into the trough 24 and prevent it from falling forward of the trough
 24. The plate 54 positioned above the trough 24 and the rear guard also assist in guiding
 the chaff 70 into the trough 24 and prevent it from falling through the central hole of
 the annular trough 24. The optional side guards 72, if fitted to the device 10, also assist
 in directing the chaff 70 into the trough 24 at respective left and right sides of the device
 10.
[0044] The hydraulic pump 32 is placed into powered connection with the harvester 12
 so as to be operable. The pump 32 drives the cog 30, the teeth of which grip links of
 the chain 26. As would be understood, the driven cog 30 causes the chain 26, and
 paddles 28 provided thereon, to rotate through the trough 24.
[0045] Once caught within the trough 24, the chaff 70 is moved through the trough 24
 by the moving paddles 28. As the chain 26 and paddles 28 move in a singular direction,
 the chaff 70 is caused to move from the forward unroofed portion of the trough 24 back
 towards the rear roofed portion of the trough 24. In time, the chaff 70 reaches the rear
 centre of trough 24 and is caused to fall through the chaff vent 46. As the chaff vent
 46 is aligned with the straw chute 48, the chaff 70 would fall on top of the previously
 deposited straw 68 windrow. Accordingly, the windrows can be baled in the normal
 manner and the chaff 70, including weed seeds is ensured to be collected in the bales
 and removed from the harvested land, thereby decreasing viable weeds in the land.
 Otherwise, the windrows may be burnt; due to the chaff 70 sitting above the straw 68,
 the chaff 70 is exposed to adequate temperatures to destroy weed seeds, rather than
                                              10

 being insulated from the fire by the straw 68 were the chaff 70 situated below the straw
 68.
[0046] Other embodiment weed seed management devices 10 are also contemplated in
 accordance with the present invention. For instance, the aforementioned means for
 moving chaff 70 through the trough 24 may, instead of being provided as a chain 26
 and paddles 28, be any means suited to the relevant function of moving chaff 70 through
 the trough 24. These means may include, for example, a spiral conveyer such as an
 auger, a conveyer belt, air blowing, vacuum means, or using an electrical charge.
 Likewise, the points of attachment 14, 16, 18 may be provided as any suitable
 attachment means, for example welding, providing a means for secure attachment of
 the device 10 to the harvester 12. Further, the construction materials herein described
 are preferable materials and other materials suited to construction of particular integers
 may also be used. For example, the aforementioned plastic guards 62, 72 and rear guard
 may be constructed of metal or fabric, for example, or any other material suited to
 directing material from the harvester 12 along its desired path. The drive cog 30 has
 been described as being driven by a hydraulic pump 32, which is generally the source
 of power for the device 10. However, any power source suitable for operating the
 device 10, may substitute the hydraulic pump 32.
[0047] Modifications and variations as would be apparent to a skilled addressee are
 deemed to be within the scope of the present invention.
