CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION
[0001]          The present application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Serial No.
62/440,143, which was filed on December 29, 2016, the entire contents of which are incorporated
herein by reference.
TECHNICAL FIELD
[0002]          The present disclosure relates to spinal surgery and, more particularly, to systems,
devices, and methods for reducing spinal rods into pedicle screw housings and/or for manipulation
of a spinal column.
BACKGROUND
[0003]          The human spinal column or spine is a highly complex structure including twenty
four discrete bones, known as vertebrae, coupled sequentially to one another to house and protect
critical elements of the body's nervous system. In between adjacent vertebrae of the spine are discs
that function as vertebral shock absorbers for distributing pressure resulting from the impact of the
body's activities.
[0004]          Various disorders, diseases, and injuries can restrict the range of motion of the
spine and/or interfere with important elements of the nervous system. Spinal fixation apparatus are
widely employed in surgical procedures for correcting such spinal conditions. For example, spinal
rods can be secured to the spine by spinal fixation fasteners, such as pedicle screws, to straighten
abnormal curvature of the spine or to provide spinal stability.
[0005]          It is desired to perform these procedures efficiently and in a minimally invasive
manner.
                                                  1

that selectively couples to the extension assembly.
[00271          In embodiments, the outer sleeve of the knob assembly may be configured to
compress the finger radially inward as the outer sleeve of the knob assembly moves relative to the
inner sleeve of the knob assembly so that the finger secures the rod reducer to the pedicle screw
assembly.
[00281          In some embodiments, the finger may be configured to bias radially outward when
the outer sleeve of the knob assembly is spaced from the finger so that the rod reducer can
separate from the pedicle screw assembly.
[0029]          According to another aspect, the present disclosure is directed to a surgical system
for manipulating a spinal bone. The surgical system includes a set screw and a first pedicle screw

therethrough at a proximal end of the pedicle screw housing 120. The pair of flanges 122a, 122b
defines a threaded internal surface 124a that is configured to threadably receive a set screw "S"
(FIG. 20B) therein to engage and secure a spinal rod "R" (shown in phantom in FIG. 2)
within the pedicle screw housing 120. The set screw "S" may be advanced into engagement with
the spinal rod "R" via a rod inserter or driver, e.g., driver 520 (FIG. 20B). For a more detailed
description of spinal rod insertion devices, reference can be made to, for example, International
Application No. PCT/US16/46523, filed August 11, 2016, the entire contents of which are
incorporated by reference herein. The pedicle screw housing 120 further defines a concave recess
126 in a distal end thereof that receives the head 1 Ob of the pedicle screw 110.
[0088]         With particular reference to FIG. 2, the pedicle screw assembly 100 further
includes an anvil 128 received within the pedicle screw housing 120. The anvil 128 defines a
distal recess 128a that receives the proximal end of the head 1 Ob of the pedicle screw 110,
while the head 110b is disposed within the concave recess 126 of the pedicle screw housing 120.
The anvil 128 further defines a saddle 128b on a proximal end thereof that supports the spinal
rod "R" thereon. For a more detailed description of similar pedicle screw assemblies, reference
can be made, for example, to U.S. Patent No. 8,882,817, the entire contents of which are
incorporated by reference herein.
[0089]         The tab assembly 130 of the pedicle screw assembly 100 includes a pair of tabs
132, 134, that may be disposed in mirrored relation with one another. The tab 132 defines a
recess 132a and includes a frangible member 132b secured to the flange 122a at a distal end of
the tab 132. The tab 134 defines a recess 134a and includes a frangible member 134b secured to
flange 122b at a distal end of the tab 134. The frangible members 132b, 134b may be integrally
                                                  13

and/or monolithically formed with respective flanges 122a, 122b. The frangible members 132b,
134b may be configured to break upon application of a threshold force thereto (e.g., twisting,
bending, tensile, and/or shear forces) to enable the tabs 132, 134 to separate from the flanges
122a, 122b. As used herein, the term "break" (or its equivalent) refers to rupturing, dividing,
tearing, fracturing, splitting, and/or the like.
[0090]         With continued reference to FIG. 2, the extension assembly 140 of the pedicle
screw assembly 100 includes a pair of extensions 142, 144 coupled to the tabs 132, 134 of the
pedicle screw assembly 100 by rings 136. More specifically, each of the pair of extensions 142,
144 defines a recess 146 in distal end portion thereof to receive one of the tabs 132, 134 of the
tab assembly 130 and one of the rings 136 therein, respectively. A protuberance 148 extends
from the recess 146 and is receivable through an opening 136a defined by the ring 136. Using
any known securement technique such as welding, friction-fit, adhesion or the like, the rings 136
are secured about the protuberances 148 and within the recesses 146 of the extension assembly
140 and the recesses 132a, 134a of the tabs 132, 134, respectively, to couple the extension
assembly 140 to the tabs 132, 134. The extension assembly 140 further includes an internal
threaded surface 149 in vertical registration with the threaded internal surface 124a of the pedicle
screw housing 120. The internal threaded surface 149 threadably receives the set screw "S" (FIG.
20B) and facilitates threaded reception of the set screw "S" into the pedicle screw housing 120
via the threaded internal surface 124a of the pedicle screw housing 120. Proximal portions of
each of the pair of extensions 142, 144 define grooves 160a and 160b (FIG. 1) that are
configured to facilitate selective attachment to various rod reducing instruments, as will be
described in detail below. The grooves 160a, 160b may have any suitable shape such as circular
and/or noncircular.    The grooves 160a, 160 may be elongated in a direction transverse to the
longitudinal axis "L-L" of the pedicle screw assembly 100. The proximal portions of each of the
                                                 14

extensions 142, 144 further include outer camming surfaces 162a, 162b.
[0091]        With brief reference back to FIG. 1, the head assembly 150 of the pedicle screw
assembly 100 defines a recess 152 having an inverted U-shape that separates a pair of arms 154a,
154b of the head assembly 150. Distal ends of the pair of arms 154a, 154b are coupled to
proximal ends of the extensions 142, 144 of the extension assembly 140 by the frangible
members 156a, 156b. Similar to the frangible members 132b, 134b of the tab assembly 130, the
frangible members 156a, 156b of the head assembly 150 are configured to break upon
application of a threshold force thereto to separate the head assembly 150 from the extension
assembly 140 as desired, for example, with a pair of pliers as detailed in International
Application No. PCT/US16/46523 incorporated herein by reference above.
[0092]        With particular reference to FIGS. 3A and 3B, the rod reducer 202 of the rod
reducer assembly 200 has a knob or cap 204 having a distal portion that is rotatably connected to
a proximal portion of a sleeve assembly 206 of the rod reducer 202. The cap 204 of the rod
reducer 202 includes an outer surface 204a and a threaded internal surface 204b that defines a
central opening 204c through the cap 204. The        outer surface 204a of the cap 204 further
includes a drive surface 204d configured to impart axial drive force, as indicated by arrows "Y"
(FIG. 4A), onto the sleeve assembly 206 in response to rotation of the cap 204, as indicated by
arrows "Z," about the longitudinal axis "Al-Al" (e.g., clockwise and/or counterclockwise) of the
rod reducer assembly 200 relative to the sleeve assembly 206.
[0093]        The sleeve assembly 206 of the rod reducer assembly 200 includes an inner sleeve
208, an outer sleeve 210 and a retaining ring 212 secured to an inner surface of the outer sleeve
210 adjacent to the inner sleeve 208. The inner sleeve 208 of the sleeve assembly 206 includes a
threaded external surface 208a on a proximal end portion thereof and gripping fingers 208b,
208c on a distal end portion thereof. The gripping fingers 208b, 208c of the inner sleeve 208
                                                15

may be in the form of hooks. The threaded external surface 208a of the inner sleeve 208 is
configured to threadably engage the threaded internal surface 204b of the cap 204 to facilitate
rotation of the cap 204 relative to the sleeve assembly 206. The gripping fingers 208b, 208c of
the inner sleeve 208 are configured to engage the grooves 160a and 160b of the pedicle screw
assembly 100 to rotationally fix the inner sleeve 208 to the pedicle screw assembly 100, thereby
fixing the rod reducer 202 to the pedicle screw assembly 100. The gripping fingers 208b, 208c
may be flexible to facilitate a snap-fit engagement into the grooves 160a and 160b of the pedicle
screw assembly 100.
[0094]        The outer sleeve 210 of the sleeve assembly 206 is in contacting relation with the
drive surface 204d of the cap 204 and positioned to surround the inner sleeve 208 and the distal
portion of the cap 204. The outer sleeve 210 includes a proximal portion 210a and a distal
portion 210b. The distal portion 210b of the outer sleeve 210 defines one or more rod-engaging
recesses 210c configured to engage the spinal rod "R." Each of the rod-engaging recesses 210c
may have an inverted U-shaped configuration. The proximal portion 210a of the outer sleeve
210 is positioned to receive the distal portion of the cap 204 to enable the cap 204 to rotate
relative to the outer sleeve 210. The outer sleeve 210 further defines longitudinal slots 210d,
210e that receive the gripping fingers 208b, 208c of the inner sleeve 208 therein. The
longitudinal slots 210d, 210e are positioned to slide along the gripping fingers 208b, 208c of the
outer sleeve 210 to enable the outer sleeve 210 to slide axially relative to the inner sleeve 208 in
response to rotation of the cap 204 relative to the sleeve assembly 206.
[0095]        In operation, the pedicle screw assembly 100 of the rod reducer assembly 200 is
mounted to a vertebra (e.g., screwed in to the vertebra) of a spine (not shown) so that the rod
reducer 202 of the rod reducer assembly 200 can be mounted on the pedicle screw assembly 100
as seen in FIGS. 3A and 3B. To mount the rod reducer 202 to the pedicle screw assembly 100,
                                                  16

the rod reducer 202 is positioned over the proximal portion of the pedicle screw assembly 100
and advanced distally along the pedicle screw assembly 100. As the rod reducer 202 is advanced
distally, the gripping fingers 208b, 208c of the rod reducer 202 engage and cam along the
camming surfaces 162a, 162b of the extension assembly 140 of the pedicle screw assembly 100.
The camming surfaces 162a, 162b of the pedicle screw assembly 100 are configured to urge or
flex the gripping fingers 208b, 208c of the rod reducer 202 radially outward as the gripping
fingers 208b, 208c are advanced distally therealong until the gripping fingers 208b, 208c of the
of the rod reducer 202 snap radially inward and into the grooves 160a, 160b of the extension
assembly 140 of the pedicle screw assembly 100. Engagement of the gripping fingers 208b,
208c of the rod reducer 202 and the grooves 160a, 160b of the extension assembly 140 of the
pedicle screw assembly 100 locks the rod reducer 202 onto the pedicle screw assembly 100.
With the gripping fingers 208b, 208c of the rod reducer 202 secured to the grooves 160a, 160b of
the extension assembly 140, the inner sleeve 208 of the rod reducer 202 is axially fixed onto the
proximal portion of the pedicle screw assembly 100.
[0096]         Referring now to FIGS. 1-4B, with the spinal rod "R" positioned within the rod
receiving passage 124 of the pedicle screw assembly 100, and the rod reducer 202 locked onto
the pedicle screw assembly 100, the cap 204 of the rod reducer 202 is rotatable (e.g., clockwise
and/or counterclockwise) relative to sleeve assembly 206 of the rod reducer 202 to impart axial
force onto the sleeve assembly 206 through the drive surface 204d of the cap 204. In particular,
rotation of the cap 204 (e.g., clockwise and/or counterclockwise) relative to the sleeve assembly
206, as indicated by arrow "Z," axially moves the outer sleeve 210 of the sleeve assembly 206, as
indicated by arrow "Y," along the longitudinal axis "Al-Al" of the rod reducer assembly 200,
and relative to the inner sleeve 208 of the sleeve assembly 206 (and relative to the pedicle screw
assembly 100), from a proximal or unreduced position (FIGS. 3A and 3B) to a distal or reduced
                                                 17

position (FIGS. 4A and 4B).
[00971         As the outer sleeve 210 of the rod reducer 202 is advanced distally relative to the
pedicle screw assembly 100, the rod-engaging recesses 210c of the outer sleeve 210 engage the
spinal rod "R" to reduce the spinal rod "R" into the pedicle screw housing 120 of pedicle screw
assembly 100 as the outer sleeve 210 moves from the unreduced position to the reduced position.
[0098]         In the reduced position of the outer sleeve 210 of the rod reducer 200, the outer
sleeve 210 supports or stabilizes the frangible members 132b, 134b, 156a, 156b of the pedicle
screw assembly 100 (see FIGS. 1 and 2) so that the rod reducer assembly 200 can be
manipulated (e.g., in one or more caudad, cephalad, posterior, anterior, and/or lateral directions)
to selectively position and/or reposition the rod reducer assembly 200, the spinal column, and/or
portions of the spinal column as desired.
[0099]         By virtue of the structural arrangement of one or more of the components of the
rod reducer assembly 200 and/or the rigidity thereof, the rod reducer assembly 200 is configured
to reinforce the pedicle screw assembly 100, extension assembly 140, the tab assembly 130,
and/or the head assembly 150 by limiting forces (e.g., twisting, bending, flexing, tensile, and/or
shear forces) from being applied (e.g. directly) to the frangible members 132b, 134b of the
pedicle screw assembly 100 and/or to the frangible members 156a, 156b of the head assembly
150 (e.g., in one or more caudad, cephalad, posterior, anterior, and/or lateral directions). Instead,
the rod reducer assembly 200 and/or components thereof, are configured to absorb these forces
and inhibit the tabs 132, 134 of the tab assembly 130 from prematurely separating from the
flanges 122a, 122b of the pedicle screw housing 120 and/or the head assembly 150 from
prematurely separating from the extension assembly 140.
[00100]        Once the rod reducer assembly 200 is positioned as desired, the cap 204 of the rod
reducer 202 can be rotated to move the outer sleeve 210 of the sleeve assembly 206 of the rod
                                                 18

reducer 202 to a proximal position (see, e.g., FIG. 3A) that is proximal of the frangible members
132b, 134b of the pedicle screw assembly 100. In such a proximal position, lateral movement of
the rod reducer 202 to a breaking threshold angle "a" (e.g., from about 1 degree to about 20
degrees) relative to the pedicle screw assembly 100 will break the frangible members 132b, 134b
and separate the rod reducer 202, the head assembly 150, the extension assembly 140, and the tab
assembly 130 from the pedicle screw housing 120 of the pedicle screw assembly 100.
[00101]       Alternatively, to separate the rod reducer 202 from the pedicle screw assembly 100
without breaking the frangible members 132b, 134b of the pedicle screw assembly 100, the rod
reducer 202 can be rotated relative to the pedicle screw assembly 100 while the rod reducer 202
is disposed in the reduced position. In the reduced position, the fingers 208b, 208c of the rod
reducer 202 are configured to cam out of the grooves 160a, 160b of the extension assembly 140
as the rod reducer 202 is rotated about the longitudinal axis "L-L" of the pedicle screw assembly
100 and relative to the pedicle screw assembly 100, as indicated by arrows "ZZ" (FIG. 4A). Once
the rod reducer 202 is separated from the pedicle screw assembly 100, the head assembly 150,
the extension assembly 140, and/or the tab assembly 130 of the pedicle screw assembly 100 can
then be separated or otherwise broken from the pedicle screw housing 120 of the pedicle screw
assembly 100 using various instruments (not shown) such as those described in International
Application No. PCT/US16/46523, entire contents of which are incorporated by reference herein.
[00102]       With reference to FIGS. 1, 2, and 5, a rod reducer assembly in accordance with
another embodiment of the present disclosure is shown and generally designated as 300. The rod
reducer assembly 300 defines a longitudinal axis "A2-A2" and generally includes the pedicle
screw assembly 100, a rod reducer 310, and a derotation sleeve 320. The rod reducer 310 may
be used to reduce a spinal rod "R" into the pedicle screw housing 120 of the pedicle screw
assembly 100 and the derotation sleeve 320 may be used to manipulate the spine while
                                                 19

inhibiting the frangible members 132b, 134b and 156a, 156b of the tab and head assemblies 130,
150 of the pedicle screw assembly 100, respectively, from breaking, similar to that described
above with respect to the rod reducer assembly 200.
[001031        With reference now to FIGS. 6-10B, the derotation sleeve 320 of the rod reducer
assembly 300 includes a knob 321, an upper shaft portion 322 extending distally from the knob
321, a lower shaft portion 323 extending distally from the upper shaft portion 322, and a locking
mechanism 330 supported between the upper and lower shaft portions 322, 323 for selectively
locking the upper and lower shaft portions 322, 323 together.
[00104]        The knob 321 of the derotation sleeve 320 includes a first portion 3210 and a
second portion 3212 that are pinned together by pins 3214. The first portion 3210 of the knob
321 includes an internal threaded surface 321a configured to threadably receive the rod reducer
310 (FIG. 5). The second portion 3212 of the knob 321 includes and an internal threaded surface
321b configured to threadably engage the upper shaft portion 322 of the derotation sleeve 320.
The second portion 3212 of the knob 321 also includes an outer surface 3212a that defines a slot
3212b therein. The second portion 3212 of the knob 321 is rotatably connected to the upper shaft
portion 322 by a retaining ring 321c. The retaining ring 321c is positioned between the knob 321
of the derotation sleeve 320 and the upper shaft portion 322 of the derotation sleeve 320 to
enable the knob 321 to rotate about the upper shaft portion 322 (e.g., clockwise and/or
counterclockwise), as indicated by arrows "X" (FIG. 6).
[00105]        The upper shaft portion 322 of the derotation sleeve 320 includes a sleeve assembly
3222 having an outer sleeve 3224 and an inner sleeve 3226. The outer sleeve 3224 includes an
inner surface 3224a defining a slot 3224b that receives the retaining ring 321c therein. The
outer sleeve 3224 is positioned to move axially, as indicated arrows "W" (FIG. 6), along the
longitudinal axis "A2-A2" of the rod reducer assembly 300 and relative to the inner sleeve 3226
                                                 20

in response to rotation of the knob 321 of the derotation sleeve 320. The outer sleeve 3224
further includes teeth 331 that extend distally from the outer sleeve 3224.
[001061       The inner sleeve 3226 of the sleeve assembly 3222 includes threads 322c on a
proximal outer surface thereof. The threads 322c (FIG. 10B) of the inner sleeve 3226 are
disposed in threaded engagement with the internal threaded surface 321b of the knob 321. The
inner sleeve 3226 of sleeve assembly 3222 further includes fingers 322a, 322b that are
selectively engagable with the grooves 160a, 160b of the extension assembly 140 of the pedicle
screw assembly 100, similar to the fingers 208b, 208c of the rod reducer assembly 200 described
above. The inner sleeve 3226 of the sleeve assembly 3222 includes a distal portion 3226a that is
received within a proximal portion of the lower shaft portion 323 of the derotation sleeve 320.
The inner sleeve 3226 of the sleeve assembly 3222 is selectively rotatably connected to the lower
shaft portion 323 by a retaining ring 322d. The retaining ring 322d is configured to enable the
upper shaft portion 322 of the derotation sleeve 320 to rotate about the longitudinal axis "A2-A2"
(e.g., clockwise and/or counterclockwise) relative to the lower shaft portion 323, as indicated by
arrows "V" (FIG. 7A), when the locking mechanism 330 is disposed in an unlocked position
(FIG. 7A) for rotatably separating the fingers 322a, 322b of the sleeve assembly 3222 from the
grooves 160a, 160b of extension assembly 140 of pedicle screw assembly 100 (see FIGS. 8A and
8B).
[001071       The lower shaft portion 323 of the derotation sleeve 320 defines recesses 332 at a
proximal end thereof configured for engagement with the plurality of teeth 331 of the upper shaft
portion 322 of the derotation sleeve 320. The lower shaft portion 323 further includes first and
second legs 324a, 324b which are positionable about the pedicle screw assembly 100 adjacent to
the frangible members 132b, 134b to stabilize and/or support the frangible members 132b, 134b
for inhibiting premature breaking of the frangible members 132b, 134b during manipulation
                                                  21

and/or derotation of the spinal column with the derotation sleeve 320 and the pedicle screw
assembly 100 coupled together.
[001081        By virtue of the structural arrangement of one or more of the components of the rod
reducer assembly 300 and/or the rigidity thereof, the rod reducer assembly 300 is configured to
reinforce the pedicle screw assembly 100, extension assembly 140, the tab assembly 130, and/or
the head assembly 150 by limiting forces (e.g., twisting, bending, flexing, tensile, and/or shear
forces) from being applied (e.g. directly) to the frangible members 132b, 134b of the pedicle
screw assembly 100 and/or to the frangible members 156a, 156b of the head assembly 150 (e.g.,
in one or more caudad, cephalad, posterior, anterior, and/or lateral directions). Instead, the rod
reducer assembly 300 and/or components thereof, are configured to absorb these forces and
inhibit the tabs 132, 134 of the tab assembly 130 from prematurely separating from the flanges
122a, 122b of the pedicle screw housing 120 and/or the head assembly 150 from prematurely
separating from the extension assembly 140.
[00109]        With reference to FIG. 7B, the locking mechanism 330 of the derotation assembly
320 includes the teeth 331 of the upper shaft portion 322 of the derotation assembly 300 and the
recesses 332 of the lower shaft portion 323 of the derotation assembly 300. The locking
mechanism 330 is positionable between an unlocked position (FIG. 7B) and a locked position
(FIG. 9B). In the unlocked position of the locking mechanism 330, the teeth 331 of the locking
mechanism 330 are spaced apart from the recesses 332 of the locking mechanism 330 by a gap
"G" (FIG. 8B) so that the upper shaft portion 322 can rotate relative to the lower shaft portion
323 to enable the derotation assembly 300 to separate from the pedicle screw assembly 100. In
the locked position of the locking mechanism 330, the teeth 331 and the recesses 332 are
engaged so that the fingers 322a, 322b (FIG. 8B) of the sleeve assembly 3222 remain engaged
within the grooves 160a, 160b of extension assembly 140 and the derotation assembly 320 and
                                                  22

the pedicle screw assembly 100 move (e.g., rotate) together, as indicated by arrows "U" (FIG.
9A), for example, to derotate the spinal column.
[00110]       In use, and with reference to FIGS. 1, 2, and FIGS. 6-10B, the derotation sleeve
320 of the rod reducer assembly 300 is mounted over the pedicle screw assembly 100 and
advanced distally along the pedicle screw assembly 100 until the fingers 322a, 322b of upper
shaft portion 322 of the derotation sleeve 320 engage (e.g., "snap" into) or lock into the grooves
160a, 160b of the extension assembly 140 of the pedicle screw assembly 100 (FIG. 8B). Initially,
the locking mechanism 330 is disposed in the unlocked position with the teeth 331 of upper shaft
portion 322 of the derotation sleeve 320 disengaged and spaced from the recesses 332 of the
lower shaft portion 323 by the gap "G".
[00111]       In order to position the locking mechanism 330 of the derotation sleeve 320 into
the locked position, a rotational (e.g., clockwise and/or counterclockwise) force is applied to the
knob 321 of the derotation sleeve 320, as indicated by arrow "X," (FIG. 6) so that the threads
321b of the knob 321 engage with the threads 322c of the upper shaft portion 322 of the
derotation sleeve 320. As the knob 321 rotates, the threaded engagement between the knob 321
and the upper shaft portion 322 moves the knob 321 distally along the threads 322c of the upper
shaft portion 322, as indicated by arrow "W" (see FIGS. 6 and 8B). The distal movement of the
knob 321 relative to the upper shaft portion 322 causes the first portion 3210 of the upper shaft
portion 322 to move distally until the teeth 331 (FIG. 7B) of the locking mechanism 330 engage
with the recesses 332 of the locking mechanism 330 (FIG. 9B). Once the teeth 331 are fully
seated within the recesses 332, the locking mechanism 330 is disposed in the locked position
such that the upper and lower shaft portions 322, 324 are locked together with the gap "G" (FIG.
8B) eliminated or substantially reduced as seen in at least FIGS. 9A, 9B, 10A, and 10B.
[00112]       With the locking mechanism 330 of the derotation sleeve 330 disposed in the
                                                 23

locked position on the pedicle screw assembly 100, the derotation sleeve 320 and the pedicle
screw assembly 100 can move together to manipulate the spine as desired, for example, to
derotate the spine and/or to correct a spinal deformity. More particularly, the derotation sleeve
330 is positioned on the pedicle screw assembly 100 so that the frangible members 132b, 134b,
156a, 156b of the pedicle screw assembly 100 are stabilized to inhibit the frangible members
132b, 134b, 156a, 156b from breaking during derotation of the spine. For a more detailed
description of related spinal derotation devices and methods, reference can be made, for
example, to U.S. Patent No. 8,956,360, the entire contents of which are incorporated by
reference   herein.   Reference    can    also be    made    to  International   Application  No.

[001131       When a clinician desires to reduce a spinal rod "R" into the pedicle screw assembly
100, the clinician can insert the spinal rod "R" between the first and second legs 324a, 324b of
derotation sleeve 320 and the extensions 142, 144 (FIG. 1) of the extension assembly 140 of the
pedicle screw assembly 100. The rod reducer 310 may be mounted to the derotation sleeve 320
while the derotation sleeve 320 is mounted on the pedicle screw assembly 100 to reduce the
spinal rod "R" into the saddle 128b (FIG. 2) of the pedicle screw assembly 100.
[00114]       As seen in FIGS. 5, 11A, 11B, 12A, and 12B, the rod reducer 310 of the rod
reducer assembly 300 includes a cap 310a that is rotatably coupled to a sleeve assembly 310b, as
indicated by arrows "Q" (FIG. 11A), by a retaining ring 310c. The cap 310a of the rod reducer
310 includes a distal portion with a threaded outer surface 311 a and a proximal gripping portion
311b.
[00115]       The sleeve assembly 310b includes an outer sleeve 312 that is rotatably coupled to
an inner sleeve 313, as indicated by arrow "T" (FIG. 11 A), to enable the inner sleeve 313 to
advance axially relative to the outer sleeve 312, as indicated by arrow "N," between a proximal
                                                24

or unreduced position (FIG. 11 A) and a distal or reduced position (FIG. 12A). The outer sleeve
312 includes an internal threaded surface 312a. The inner sleeve 313 includes a first arm 313a
and a second arm 313b that are coupled by a nut 313c having an inner surface 313d and a
threaded outer surface 313e. The threaded outer surface 313e of the nut 313c is threadably
engagable with internal threaded surface 312a of the outer sleeve 312 to enable the outer sleeve
312 to rotate about the longitudinal axis "A2-A2" of the rod reducer assembly 300 and relative to
the inner sleeve 313 thereof. The first and second arms 313a, 313b of the inner sleeve 313
extend distally from opposite sides of the nut 313c to rod-engaging recesses 314a, 314b,
respectively. The rod-engaging recesses 314a, 314b of the inner sleeve 313 may include inverted
U-shaped or arched configurations.
[001161       In use, the rod reducer 310 of the rod reducer assembly 300 is mounted over the
derotation sleeve 320 so that the distal portion of the cap 310a of the rod reducer 310 is
threadably received in the proximal end of the knob 321 of the derotation sleeve 320 as seen in
FIGS. 11A and 11B. Specifically, the threaded outer surface 311a of the cap 310a of the rod
reducer 310 threadably engages with the internal threaded surface 321a of the knob 321 of the
derotation sleeve 320 to mount the rod reducer 310 to the derotation sleeve 320 and the pedicle
screw assembly 100.
[001171       Once the rod reducer 310 is threadably mounted onto the derotation sleeve 320, the
outer sleeve 312 of the rod reducer 310 can be rotated relative to the inner sleeve 313, as
indicated by arrows "T," to drive the first and second arms 313a, 313b of the inner sleeve 313
distally from the unreduced position (FIGS. 11 A and 1 IB) to the reduced position (FIGS. 12A
and 12B) and reduce the spinal rod "R" into the saddle 128b (FIG. 2) of the pedicle screw
assembly 100.
[001181       With the frangible members 132b, 134b, 156a, 156b of the pedicle screw assembly
                                               25

100 (see FIGS. 1 and 2) supported/stabilized by the derotation sleeve 320, the entire rod reducer
assembly 300 can likewise be manipulated to selectively position and/or reposition the rod
reducer assembly 300, the spinal column, and/or portions of the spinal column as desired. It
should be appreciated that derotation of the spine and compression and distraction of vertebrae
may be performed with, or without, the rod reducer 310 mounted to the derotation sleeve 320.
[00119]        The rod reducer 310 may be removed from the derotation sleeve 320 by
unthreading of the cap 310a from the knob 321 of the derotation sleeve 320. The derotation
sleeve 320 may be removed by unthreading the knob 321 of the derotation sleeve 320 from the
upper shaft portion 322 of the derotation sleeve 320 so that the teeth 331 of to the locking
mechanism 330 of the derotation sleeve 320 disengage from the recesses 332 of the locking
mechanism 330 to unlock the locking mechanism 330 and separate and upper and lower shaft
portions 322, 323. With the locking mechanism 330 unlocked, the upper shaft portion 322 can
be rotated relative to the lower shaft portion 323 so that the fingers 322a, 322b of the upper shaft
portion 322 rotatably cam out of the grooves 160a, 160b of the extension assembly 140 and the
derotation sleeve 320 separates from the pedicle screw assembly 100.
[00120]        Referring now to FIGS. 1, 2, 13 and 14, a rod reducer assembly in accordance with
another embodiment of the present disclosure is shown and generally designated as 400. The rod
reducer assembly 400 is positionable on the pedicle screw assembly 100 and configured to
reduce the spinal rod "R" (FIG. 2) into the pedicle screw housing 120 of the pedicle screw
assembly 100 and to inhibit the frangible members 132b, 134b, 156a, 156b of the tab and head
assemblies 130, 150 of the pedicle screw assembly 100, respectively, from prematurely breaking
during a derotation and/or manipulation of the spine.
[00121]        By virtue of the structural arrangement of one or more of the components of the rod
reducer assembly 400 and/or the rigidity thereof, the rod reducer assembly 400 is configured to
                                                  26

reinforce the pedicle screw assembly 100, extension assembly 140, the tab assembly 130, and/or
the head assembly 150 by limiting forces (e.g., twisting, bending, flexing, tensile, and/or shear
forces) from being applied (e.g. directly) to the frangible members 132b, 134b of the pedicle
screw assembly 100 and/or to the frangible members 156a, 156b of the head assembly 150 (e.g.,
in one or more caudad, cephalad, posterior, anterior, and/or lateral directions). Instead, the rod
reducer assembly 400 and/or components thereof, are configured to absorb these forces and
inhibit the tabs 132, 134 of the tab assembly 130 from prematurely separating from the flanges
122a, 122b of the pedicle screw housing 120 and/or the head assembly 150 from prematurely
separating from the extension assembly 140.
[00122]        With reference also to FIGS. 15A, 15B, 16, and 18, the rod reducer assembly 400
defines a longitudinal axis "A3-A3" and generally includes the pedicle screw assembly 100 and a
rod reducer 410. The rod reducer 410 includes a knob assembly 412 configured to selectively
mount the rod reducer 410 to the pedicle screw assembly 100 and a reduction sleeve assembly
414 coupled to the knob assembly 412 and configured to reduce the spinal rod "R" (FIG. 2) into
the pedicle screw assembly 100 while the rod reducer 410 is mounted to the pedicle screw
assembly 100.
[00123]        The knob assembly 412 of the rod reducer 410 includes an outer sleeve 412a that
defines a threaded internal surface 412b and an inner sleeve 412c. The outer sleeve 412a is
rotatable (e.g., clockwise and/or counterclockwise) about the inner sleeve 412c, as indicated by
arrows "H," and axially movable along the longitudinal axis "A3-A3" between a proximal
position (FIG. 15A) and distal position (FIG. 16), as indicated by arrows "I." The inner sleeve
412c is positioned within the outer sleeve 412a and includes a proximal portion 412d, a central
portion 412e, and a distal portion 412f. The proximal portion 412d of the inner sleeve 412c
includes a threaded outer surface 412g that threadably engages the threaded internal surface 412b
                                                27

of the outer sleeve 412a. The central portion 412e of the inner sleeve 412c includes first and
second fingers 412h, 412i supported on opposite sides of the central portion 412e. The first and
second fingers 412h, 412i, which may each be in the form of a hook, are biased radially outward
and are configured to be received within the grooves 160a and 160b of the pedicle screw
assembly 100. The distal portion 412f of the inner sleeve 412c is received within a proximal
portion of the reduction sleeve assembly 414 and coupled to the reduction sleeve assembly 414
by a retaining ring 416.
[00124]       The reduction sleeve assembly 414 of the rod reducer assembly 400 includes an
outer sleeve 418, a first inner sleeve 420a coupled to the outer sleeve 418 and configured to
reduce the spinal rod "R" in response to rotation of the outer sleeve 418, and a second inner
sleeve 420b coupled to the first inner sleeve 420a and configured to mount to the pedicle screw
housing 120 of the pedicle screw assembly 100. The first and second inner sleeves 420a, 420b
are positioned within the outer sleeve 418. As indicated by arrow "F" (FIG. 15A), the outer
sleeve 418 is rotatable about the longitudinal axis "A3-A3" relative to the inner sleeves 420a,
420b. As seen in FIG. 18, and as indicated by arrows "0," the first inner sleeve 420a is axially
movable along the longitudinal axis "A3-A3" of the rod reducer assembly 400 relative to the
outer sleeve 418 and the second inner sleeve 420b between a proximal or unreduced position
(FIG. 16) and a distal or reduced position (FIG. 18). The outer sleeve 418 of the reduction sleeve
assembly 414 is rotatably coupled to the distal portion 412f of the inner sleeve 412c of the knob
assembly 412 by the retaining ring 416. The retaining ring 416 is configured to enable the outer
sleeve 418 of the reduction sleeve assembly 414 to rotate relative to the inner sleeve 412c of the
knob assembly 412 and the first and second inner sleeves 420a, 420b of the reduction sleeve
assembly 414. The outer sleeve 418 includes an outer surface 418a and a threaded inner surface
418b.
                                               28

[001251       The first inner sleeve 420a of the reduction sleeve assembly 414 is axially
advanceable along the pedicle screw assembly 100. The first inner sleeve 420a has a tubular
body 424 having a threaded proximal end portion 424a and a distal end portion 424b. The distal
end portion 424b (FIG. 19B) of the first inner sleeve 420a defines a first rod-engaging recess
424c on a first side of the tubular body 424 and a second rod-engaging recess 424d on a second
side of the tubular body 424. The first and second recesses 424c, 424d are positioned to engage
the spinal rod "R" and may have an inverted U-shaped or arched configuration.
[00126]       The second inner sleeve 420b has a tubular proximal portion fixedly supported
within the inner sleeve 412c of the knob assembly 412 and a distal portion having first and
second legs 413a, 413b that are configured to couple to outer side surfaces of the pedicle screw
housing 120 of the pedicle screw assembly 100 to support the rod reducer 410 on the pedicle
screw assembly 100. The first and second legs 413a, 413b define a spinal rod passage 413c
configured to slidably receive a spinal rod "R" (FIG. 2) axially therealong.
[001271       With reference to FIGS. 13-19B, in use, the rod reducer 410 is mounted over the
pedicle screw assembly 100 with the outer sleeve 412a of the knob assembly 412 of the rod
reducer 410 in the proximal position and the first and second fingers 412h, 412i of the knob
assembly 412 biased radially outward and axially aligned with the grooves 160a and 160b of the
pedicle screw assembly 100. In order to secure the rod reducer 410 to the pedicle screw
assembly 100, the outer sleeve 412a of the knob assembly 412 is rotated relative to the inner
sleeve 412c of the knob assembly 412 until the outer sleeve 412a engages the first and second
fingers 412h, 412i of the inner sleeve 412c of the knob assembly 412. As the outer sleeve 412a
continues to advance distally toward the distal position of the inner sleeve 412c, the outer sleeve
412a urges the fingers 412h, 412i of the inner sleeve 412c radially inward into the grooves 160a
and 160b of the pedicle screw assembly 100, as indicated by arrows "E" (FIG. 17B). With the
                                                 29

fingers 412h, 412i of the inner sleeve 412c positioned in the grooves 160a and 160b of the
pedicle screw assembly 100, the rod reducer 410 is locked onto the pedicle screw assembly 100.
[00128]        Once the rod reducer 410 of the rod reducer assembly 400 is locked onto the
pedicle screw assembly 100 of the rod reducer assembly 400, the rod reducer 410 may be used to
manipulate and/or derotate the spine or correct a spinal deformity while supporting/stabilizing
the frangible members 132b, 134b, 156a, 156b of the pedicle screw assembly 100. While locked
onto the pedicle screw assembly 100, the rod reducer 410 is configured to inhibit the frangible
members 132b, 134b, 156a, 156b of the pedicle screw assembly 100 from prematurely breaking
during a derotation and/or manipulation procedure.
[00129]        In order to reduce the spinal rod "R" (FIG. 2) into the pedicle screw housing 120 of
the pedicle screw assembly 100, the outer sleeve 418 of the reduction sleeve assembly 414 of the
rod reducer assembly 400 is rotated relative to the inner sleeves 420a, 420b of the reduction
sleeve assembly 414, as indicated by arrows "F" (FIG. 15A). As the outer sleeve 418 is rotated,
the first inner sleeve 420a moves distally relative to the second inner sleeve 420b and along the
pedicle screw assembly 100 by virtue of the threaded engagement between the first inner sleeve
420a and the outer sleeve 418. Distal advancement of the first inner sleeve 420a causes the first
and second recesses 424c, 424d to engage and reduce the spinal rod "R" into the pedicle screw
housing 120 of the pedicle screw assembly 100. To remove the rod reducer 410 of the rod
reducer assembly 400 from the pedicle screw assembly 100 of the rod reducer assembly 400, the
outer sleeve 412a of the knob assembly 412 is rotated to advance the outer sleeve 412a of the
knob assembly 412 proximally relative to the inner sleeve 412c of the knob assembly 412 until
the fingers 412h, 412i of the inner sleeve 412c are exposed. With the fingers 412h, 412i
exposed, the fingers 412h, 412i are configured to bias radially outward from within the grooves
160a and 160b of the pedicle screw assembly 100, as indicated by arrows "C" (FIG. 15B). The
                                                  30

rod reducer 410 may then be removed from the pedicle screw assembly 100.
[001301       With any of the presently disclosed rod reducers coupled or uncoupled to the
presently disclosed pedicle screw assemblies, a set screw "S"(FIG. 20B) may be threaded into
the pedicle screw housing 120 of the pedicle screw assembly 100 via the threaded internal
surface 124a of the pedicle screw housing 120 to facilitate seating and/or securement of the
spinal rod "R" into the saddle 128b of the pedicle screw housing 120.
[00131]       Referring now to FIG. 20A, a surgical system for mounting and/or manipulating
spinal rods "R" and/or pedicle screw assemblies to a spinal column is provided. The surgical
system is generally designated as 500. The surgical system 500 may be used to manipulate
vertebrae in conjunction with any of the presently disclosed rod reducer      assemblies.    The
surgical system 500 includes a handle 510 selectively attachable to one or more drivers 520 for
mounting one or more pedicle screw assemblies 100 to a spine and/or for securing one or more
set screws "S"to the one or more pedicle screw assemblies 100. The surgical system 500 further
includes a fulcrum 530 mountable to the one or more drivers 520 for supporting the drivers 520
and a distraction and compression instrument 540 selectively engagable with the one or more
drivers 520 to approximate or unapproximate the one or more drivers 520.
[00132]       The handle 510 of the surgical system 500 includes a gripping portion 511 at a
proximal end thereof and a mounting sleeve 512 at a distal end thereof for mounting to a
proximal end of the driver 520. The driver 520 includes an elongated shaft 520b and a driving
bit 521 that extends distally from the elongated shaft 520b. The driver 520 further includes a
boss 522 disposed along elongated shaft 520b.
[00133]       The fulcrum 530 of the surgical system 500 includes a body 531 defining apertures
531a. Each of the apertures 531a is configured to receive the boss 522 of one of the drivers 520
such that adjacent drivers 520 can be positioned adjacent one another.
                                                31

[001341        The distraction and compression instrument 540 of the surgical system 500
includes a stationary body 541a having a wing 542a extending therefrom, and a movable body
541b having a wing 542b extending therefrom. The stationary and movable body 541a, 541b are
supported on a dial 545 having teeth 545a for slidably engaging with movable body 541b as the
movable body 541b moves along the dial 545, as indicated by arrows "B," (FIG. 20A) relative to
the stationary body 541a between approximated (FIG. 20A) and unapproximated positions (FIG.
21). The movable body 541b includes a driver receiver 543 that is operatively coupled to the
teeth 545a of the dial 545 and is rotatable, as indicated by arrows "M"(FIG. 20A), to slide the
movable body 541b along the dial 545 between the approximated and unapproximated positions
relative to the stationary body 541a. The movable body 541b further includes a switch 544 that is
operable to select between a distraction mode, in which the movable body 541b moves away or
unapproximates from the stationary body 541a as the driver receiver 543 rotates, and a
compression mode, in which the movable body 541b moves toward or approximates the
stationary body 541b as the driver receiver 543 rotates.
[00135]        In use, once one or more pedicle screw assemblies 100 are installed into adjacent
vertebrae, and a spinal rod "R" is reduced into the pedicle screw housings 120 thereof, one or
more drivers 520 may be introduced into the pedicle screw assemblies 100 to tighten a set screw
"S" against the spinal rod "R" to facilitate seating of the spinal rod "R," for example. The
fulcrum 530 can be mounted to the bosses 522 of each driver 520 to support the drivers 520
relative to one another. The distraction and compression instrument 540 can be coupled to
adjacent drivers 520 with the wings 542a, 542b of the stationary and movable bodies 541a, 541b,
respectively, positioned in contact with the adjacent drivers 520. The driver receiver 543 can
then be rotated to move the movable body 541b relative to the stationary body 541a of the
distraction and compression instrument 540. Depending on whether the switch 544 is in the
                                                32

compression or distraction mode, the wings 542a, 542b of the stationary and movable bodies
541a, 541b, respectively, will either compress or distract the drivers 520 relative to one another
as desired to cause a corresponding separation and/or distraction of one or more vertebrae of the
spinal column to which the surgical system 500 is attached. When the spinal column, or portion
thereof are in a desired position, one or more set screw "S" can be tightened as necessary to
secure or fix the position of one or more of the spinal rods "R" and/or one or more of the pedicle
screw assemblies 100.
[00136]        One or more of the components of the surgical system 500 can then be removed
from the pedicle screw assemblies 100 and the frangible members 132b, 134b, 156a, and 156b
(FIG. 2) thereof can be broken to remove, for example, the extension assemblies 140 of the
pedicle screw assemblies 100 from the respective pedicle screw housings 120 (with the one or
more spinal rods "R" secured thereto for maintaining the spine in a corrected position) as
described herein or as detailed in International Application No. PCT/US16/46523 incorporated
herein by reference.
[001371        With reference to FIG. 22, a surgical system in accordance with another
embodiment of the present disclosure is shown and generally designated as 600 may include, or
be used with, any of the presently disclosed rod reducing assemblies.
[00138]        With reference to FIGS. 23A, 23B, 24A, 24B, 25, and 26, a surgical system in
accordance with another embodiment of the present disclosure is shown and generally designated
700. The surgical system 700 may be used to manipulate the spine while inhibiting the frangible
members 132b, 134b and 156a, 156b of the tab and head assemblies 130, 150 of the pedicle
screw assembly 100, respectively, from breaking as the set screw "S" is driven into the pedicle
screw housing 120 of the pedicle screw assembly 100.
[00139]        The surgical system 700 generally includes a pedicle screw assembly 100, a driver
                                                 33

710, a support sleeve 720, and an anti-torque tool 730. The driver 710 is used for rotating the set
screw "S" into the pedicle screw housing 120 (FIG. 1) of the pedicle screw assembly 100. The
support sleeve 720 is selectively mountable to the pedicle screw assembly 100 and is configured
to support the pedicle screw assembly 100 as the set screw "S" is reduced into the pedicle screw
assembly 100. The anti-torque tool 730 is configured to selectively attach to the support sleeve
720 to inhibit unwanted rotation of the pedicle screw assembly 100 and the support sleeve 720,
for example, as the driver 710 rotates the set screw "S" into the pedicle screw assembly 100.
[00140]       The driver 710 of the surgical system 700 includes a handle 711 for gripping the
driver 710, an elongated shaft 712 extending distally from the handle 711, and a driving bit 713
(FIG. 25) extending distally from the elongated shaft 712 and configured to engage and drive the
set screw "S" into the pedicle screw housing 120 of the pedicle screw assembly 100.
[00141]       The support sleeve 720 of the surgical system 700 defines a longitudinal axis "A4
A4." Although shown with a cylindrically shaped body, the support sleeve 720 may have any
suitable shape and/or configuration. The support sleeve 720 includes an upper shaft portion 721
that extends to a distal surface 721b and has a first gripping portion 721a at proximal end, and
which is configured for selective engagement with an anti-torque tool 730. The support sleeve
720 also defines a recessed portion 722 extending distally from the distal surface 721b of the
upper shaft portion 721 and recessed therefrom. The support sleeve 720 further includes a tubular
body 723 that extends distally from the recessed portion 722 and has a proximal end and a distal
end. The proximal end of the tubular body 723 of the support sleeve 720 has a second gripping
portion 723a configured for engagement with the anti-torque tool 730.
[00142]       The first gripping portion 721a of the support sleeve 720 has a sidewall 721c
defining one or more side surfaces 721d positioned to facilitate gripping and may be at the same
or different angles relative to each other. Similarly, the second gripping portion 723a of the
                                                  34

support sleeve 720 has a sidewall 723b defining one or more side surfaces 723c positioned to
facilitate gripping and, may be at the same or different angles relative to each other. In certain
embodiments, one or both of the sidewalls 721c, 723b of the respective first and second gripping
portions 721a, 723a of the support sleeve 720 may be textured, e.g., to facilitate gripping with
anti-torque tool 730. In some embodiments, the sidewalls 721c, 723b of the respective first and
second gripping portions 721a, 723a of the support sleeve 720 may define and suitable circular
and/or non-circular profile configured for engagement with a torqueing instrument, e.g., the anti
torque tool 730, for example, such profile may include one or more configurations including
hexagonal, star, square, circular, triangular, etc., and/or any combinations thereof.
[00143]        In use, each of the first and second gripping portions 721a, 723a of the support
sleeve 720 may be configured to receive one or more anti-torque tools 730, separately, and/or
simultaneously, as desired. With the first gripping portion 721a positioned farther from the
patient than the second gripping portion 723a, the first gripping portion 721a may provide
additional leverage for manipulating the vertebrae (given the larger moment arm relative to the
patient's vertebrae) as compared to the second gripping portion 723a.
[00144]        The distal end of the tubular body 723 of the support sleeve 720 defines a first rod
engaging recess 724a (FIG. 23A) on a first side of the tubular body 723 and a second rod
engaging recess 724b (FIG. 24B) on a second side of the tubular body 723. The first and second
rod-engaging recesses 724a, 724b are configured to engage the spinal rod "R" and may have an
inverted U-shaped or arched configuration. The support sleeve 720 includes an inner surface
720a that defines a hollow passage 725 configured to selectively receive the pedicle screw
assembly 100 and the driver 710 therein. The support sleeve 720 defines elongated channels
726a, 726b therealong. The elongated channels 726a, 726b may be configured to provide easy
access to the inner surface 720a of support sleeve 720, e.g., for cleaning the inner surface 720a of
                                                   35

the support sleeve 720. The elongated channels 726a, 726b may act as, e.g., as a window to
provide a visual of the location of pedicle screw assembly 100 relative to the support sleeve 720.
The support sleeve 720 may include indicia 727 (e.g., a laser marked line or the like) disposed on
an outer surface of the tubular body 723 of the support sleeve 720. The indicia 727 can be used
to determine the orientation of the pedicle screw assembly 100 relative to the support sleeve 720.
For example, when the support sleeve 720 is fully seated onto the pedicle screw assembly 100,
the top or proximal end of the head assembly 150 of the pedicle screw assembly 100 may align
with the indicia 727 of the support sleeve 720.
[00145]        With reference to FIG. 26, the anti-torque tool 730 of the surgical system 700
includes an elongated shaft portion 731, a receiving member 732 configured to engage one of the
first or second gripping portions 721a, 723a (FIG. 24A) of the support sleeve 720, a recess
receiving member 733 configured to engage the recessed portion 722 of the support sleeve 720, a
knob 734 disposed along the elongated shaft portion 731 and configured to impart movement to
the recess- receiving member 733, and a pin 735 that couples the recess-receiving member 733 to
the knob 734.
[00146]        The receiving member 732 of the anti-torque tool 730 has a first grasping portion
732b that defines an opening 732a. The first grasping portion 732b may include one or more
grasping surfaces 732c with one or more teeth configured to engage or grip the first or second
gripping portions 721a, 723a of the support sleeve 720 to inhibit the support sleeve 720 from
rotating and/or to facilitate manipulation of the support sleeve 720 relative to the patient's
vertebrae. The one or more grasping surfaces 732c of the first grasping portion 732b may be
positioned at the same and/or different angles relative to one other. Similar to the first grasping
portion 732b, the recess-receiving member 733 of the anti-torque tool 730 includes a second
grasping portion 733c having one or more grasping surfaces 733d that define an opening 733b to
                                                 36

enable the anti-torque tool 730 to grasp the recessed portion 722 of the support sleeve 720.
[00147]         To operate the anti-torque tool 730, a force is applied to the knob 734 of the anti
torque tool 730 in an axial (e.g., proximally) direction "X1" so that the knob 734 slides axially
along elongated shaft portion 731. By virtue of the recess-receiving member 733 being coupled
to the knob 734 via the pin 735 of the anti-torque tool 730, the force applied in the axial direction
"X1" causes a corresponding movement of the recess-receiving member 733 in the axial
direction "X1" such that the recess-receiving member 733 is retracted, e.g., proximally, and
misaligned with the receiving member 732. With the knob 734 coupled to a return spring (not
shown) disposed within the elongated shaft portion 731 of the anti-torque tool 730, when the
knob 734 is released, the return spring causes the knob 734 and the recess-receiving member 733
to return (e.g., distally) to an initial position in which the recess-receiving member 733 is aligned
or substantially aligned with the receiving member 732, as seen in FIG. 26.
[00148]         In use, the pedicle screw assembly 100 of the surgical system 700 can be installed
into a vertebra, and the spinal rod "R" can be reduced into the pedicle screw housing 120 of the
pedicle screw assembly 100. The support sleeve 720 of the surgical system 700 can be placed
over, and advanced onto, the pedicle screw assembly 100 until the first and second rod-engaging
recesses 724a, 724b of the support sleeve 720 engage the spinal rod "R." As desired, the anti
torque tool 730 can be placed onto the support sleeve 720.
[00149]         To attach the anti-torque tool 730 to the support sleeve 720, for example, to one of
the first or second gripping portions 721a, 723a of the support sleeve 720, the knob 734 of the
anti-torque tool 730 can be pulled back in the axial direction "Xl" by applying a force in the axial
direction "X1," which causes the recess-receiving member 733 to be pulled back or retracted in
the axial direction "X1." The receiving member 732 of the anti-torque tool 730 can be advanced
toward the support sleeve 720 until the grasping portion 732b of the receiving member 732 of the
                                                     37

anti-torque tool 730 surrounds a respective one of the first or second gripping portions 721a,
723a of the support sleeve 720. The anti-torque tool 730 can be moved down or distally onto the
respective one of the first or second gripping portions 721a, 723a of the support sleeve 720 until
the grasping portion 732b of the receiving member 732 of the anti-torque tool 730 engages with
one of the first or second gripping portions 721a, 723a of the support sleeve 720.
[00150]         With respect to the second gripping portion 723a of the support sleeve 720, in order
to lock the anti-torque tool 730 onto the support sleeve 720, force applied to the knob 734 can be
released, which causes recess-receiving member 733 to return (e.g., via the return spring, not
shown) or snap back to the rest or initial position and engage the support sleeve 720. For
example, with respect to the second gripping portion 723a of the support sleeve 720, as the
recess-receiving member 733 returns, the recess-receiving member 733 becomes wedged
between the receiving member 732 and the distal surface 721b of the upper shaft portion 721 of
the support sleeve 720. Once the receiving member 733 is biased back to its initial position and
secured to the support sleeve 720, the anti-torque tool 730 is locked onto the support sleeve 720
and is inhibited from premature removal from the support sleeve 720. The driver 710 of the
surgical system 700 may be introduced into the pedicle screw assembly 100 and the support
sleeve 720 to tighten the set screw "S with the driving bit 713 of the driver 710. As the set screw
"S" is tightened against the spinal rod "R," the spinal rod "R" is driven or seated into the pedicle
screw housing 120 of the pedicle screw assembly 100. While tightening the set screw "S," a
clinician may firmly grasp the elongated shaft portion 731 of the anti-torque tool 730 to inhibit
the support sleeve 720 and/or the pedicle screw assembly 100 from rotating (e.g., rotationally
fix) to facilitate driving and/or tightening of the set screw "S" so that the set screw "S" can secure
the spinal rod "R" to the pedicle screw assembly 100. Once the set screw "S" is secured to the
spinal rod "R," the driver 710 may be withdrawn proximally from the support sleeve 720.
                                                   38

[00151]        To remove the anti-torque tool 730 from the support sleeve 720 with respect to
either the first or second gripping portions 721a, 723a of the support sleeve 720, the anti-torque
tool 730 can be moved up or proximally off, the first or second gripping portions 721a, 723a of
the support sleeve 720 until the grasping portion 732b of the receiving member 732 of the anti
torque tool 730 is disengaged from the respective first or second gripping portions 721a, 723a of
the support sleeve 720. The support sleeve 720 may then be moved proximally away from the
pedicle screw assembly 100 to remove the support sleeve 720 from the pedicle screw assembly
100 and, e.g., out of a body cavity.
[00152]        Alternatively, and or additionally, to remove the anti-torque tool 730 from the
second gripping portion 723a of the support sleeve 720, force in the axial direction "X1" can be
applied to the knob 734 of the anti-torque tool 730 to retract the recess-receiving member 733
and disengage the recess-receiving member 733 from the recessed portion 722. With the recess
receiving member 733 of the anti-torque tool 730 disengaged from the recessed portion 722 of
the support sleeve 720, the recess-receiving member 733 is no longer wedged between the distal
surface 721b of the upper shaft portion 721 of the support sleeve 720 and the receiving member
732 of the anti-torque tool 730 so that the anti-torque tool 730 can be separated from the support
sleeve 720.
