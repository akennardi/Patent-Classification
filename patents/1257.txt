Abstract
Provided herein are methods of preventing and/or treating myocardial infarction and/or stroke in a
subject by administering ethyl eicosapentaenoate (E-EPA). Preferably, the subject is previously
identified as having dyslipidemia, is on stable statin therapy and has a fasting baseline triglyceride
level of about 200 mg/dL to about 500 mg/dL and optionally has established cardiovascular disease
or has a high risk of developing cardiovascular disease. Compositions may be formulated for daily
administration to provide about 4 g of the ethyl eicosapentaenoate per day. Further provided are
methods of lowering triglyceride levels in a subject on stable statin therapy having baseline fasting
triglycerides of about 200 mg/dl to about 500 mg/dl, by administering polyunsaturated fatty acids,
for example about Ig to about 4g of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) per day. Such therapy, when used
daily for 12 weeks, lowers fasting triglycerides and decreases LDL-C, or does not increase LDL-C.

compositions and methods of using such compositions to treat and/or prevent
cardiovascular-related diseases.    In one embodiment, the subject is on concomitant
statin therapy.   In another embodiment, the subject on statin therapy has a baseline
fasting serum triglyceride level of about 200 mg/dL to about 500 mg/dL.
         [0003] In one embodiment, the invention provides a method of lowering
triglycerides in a subject on stable statin therapy having baseline fasting triglycerides
of about 200 mg/dl to about 500 mg/dl, the method comprising administering to the
subject a pharmaceutical composition comprising polyunsaturated fatty acids, for
example about I g to about 4 g of EPA per day, wherein upon administering the

composition to the subject daily for a period of 12 weeks the subject exhibits at least
5% lower fasting triglycerides than a control subject maintained on stable statin
therapy (optionally with placebo matching the EPA) without concomitant EPA for a
period of 12 weeks wherein the control subject also has baseline fasting triglycerides

         [0007] In one embodiment, the invention provides a method for treatment
and/or prevention of cardiovascular-related diseases. The term "cardiovascular-related
disease" herein refers to any disease or disorder of the heart or blood vessels (i.e.
arteries and veins) or any symptom thereof. Non-limiting examples of cardiovascular
related disease and disorders include hypertriglyceridemia, hypercholesterolemia,
mixed dyslipidemia, coronary heart disease, vascular disease, stroke, atherosclerosis,
arrhythmia, hypertension, myocardial infarction, and other cardiovascular events.
         [0008] The term "treatment" in relation a given disease or disorder, includes,
but is not limited to, inhibiting the disease or disorder, for example, arresting the
development of the disease or disorder; relieving the disease or disorder, for example,
causing regression of the disease or disorder; or relieving a condition caused by or
resulting from the disease or disorder, for example, relieving, preventing or treating
symptoms of the disease or disorder. The term "prevention" in relation to a given
disease or disorder means: preventing the onset of disease development if none had
occurred, preventing the disease or disorder from occurring in a subject that may be
predisposed to the disorder or disease but has not yet been diagnosed as having the
disorder or disease, and/or preventing further disease/disorder development if already
present.
         [0009] In one embodiment, the present invention provides a method of blood
lipid therapy comprising administering to a subject or subject group in need thereof a
pharmaceutical composition as described herein. In another embodiment, the subject
or subject group has hypertriglyceridemia. hypercholesterolemia, mixed dyslipidemia
and/or very high triglycerides.
         [0010] In another embodiment, the subject or subject group being treated has a
baseline triglyceride level (or mean or median baseline triglyceride level in the case of
a subject group), fed or fasting, of about 200 mg/dl to about 500 mg/dl. In another
embodiment, the subject or subject group has a baseline LDL-C level (or mean or
median baseline LDL-C level), despite stable statin therapy, of about 40 mg/dl to about
115 or about 40 to about 100 mg/dl.
         [00 11] In one embodiment, the subject or subj ect group being treated in
accordance with methods of the invention is on concomitant statin therapy, for
example atorvastatin, rosuvastatin or simvastatin therapy (with or without ezetimibe).

accordance with methods of the invention has a body mass index (BMI or mean BMI)
of not more than about 45 kg/m2 .
         [0013] In one embodiment, the invention provides a method of lowering
triglycerides in a subject on stable statin therapy having baseline fasting triglycerides
of about 200 mg/dl to about 500 mg/dl, the method comprising administering to the
subject a pharmaceutical composition comprising about 1 g to about 4 g of EPA (e.g.
ultra-pure EPA), wherein upon administering the composition to the subject daily for a
period of about 12 weeks the subject exhibits at least 10%, at least 15%, at least 20%,
at least 25%, at least 30%,. at least 35%, at least 40%, at least 45%, at least 50%, at
least 55%, at least 60%, at least 65%, at least 70%, or at least 75% lower fasting
triglycerides than a control subject maintained on stable statin therapy (and optionally
placebo matching the ultra-pure EPA) without concomitant ultra-pure EPA for a
period of about 12 weeks, wherein the control subject also has baseline fasting
triglycerides of about 200 mg/dI to about 500 mg/dl. The term "stable statin therapy"
herein means that the subject, subject group, control subject or control subject group in
question has been taking a stable daily dose of a statin (e.g. atorvastatin, rosuvastatin
or simvastatin) for at least 4 weeks prior to the baseline fasting triglyceride
measurement (the "qualifying period"). For example, a subject or control subject on
stable statin therapy would receive a constant daily (i.e. the same dose each day) statin
dose for at least 4 weeks immediately prior to baseline fasting triglyceride
measurement.       In one embodiment, the subject's and control subject's LDL-C is
maintained between about 40 mg/dl and about 115 mg/dl or about 40 mg/dl to about
100 mg/dl during the qualifying period.        The subject and control subject are then
continued on their stable statin dose for the 12 week period post baseline.
         [0014] In one embodiment, the statin is administered to the subject and the
control subject in an amount of about 1 mg to about 500 mg, about 5 mg to about 200

425 mg, about 450 mg, about 475 mg, or about 500 mg. In another embodiment, the
subject (and optionally the control subject) has a baseline LDL-C level, despite stable
statin therapy, of about 40 mg/dl to about 115 mg/dl or about 40 mg/dl to about 100
mg/dl. In another embodiment, the subject and/or control subject has a body mass
index (BMI; or mean BMI) of not more than about 45 kg/m2 .
         [0015] In another embodiment, the invention provides a method of lowering
triglycerides in a subject group on stable statin therapy having mean baseline fasting
triglycerides of about 200 mg/dl to about 500 mg/dI, the method comprising
administering to members of the subject group a pharmaceutical composition
comprising about 1 g to about 4 g of ultra-pure EPA per day, wherein upon
administering the composition to the members of the subject group daily for a period

triglycerides than a control subject group maintained on stable statin therapy without
concomitant ultra-pure EPA (optionally with matching placebo) for a period of about
12 weeks, wherein the control subject group also has mean baseline fasting
triglycerides of about 200 mg/dl to about 500 mg/dI. In a related embodiment, the
stable statin therapy will be sufficient such that the subject group has a mean LDL-C

outcomes (a) - (y) described immediately above.
        [0031] Parameters (a) - (y) can be measured in accordance with any clinically
acceptable methodology. For example, triglycerides, total cholesterol, HDL-C and
fasting blood sugar can be sample from serum and analyzed using standard photometry
techniques. VLDL-TG, LDL-C and VLDL-C can be calculated or determined using
serum lipoprotein fractionation by preparative ultracentrifugation and subsequent
quantitative analysis by refractometry or by analytic ultracentrifugal methodology.
Apo Al, Apo B and hsCRP can be determined from serum using standard
nephelometry techniques.       Lipoprotein (a) can be determined from serum using
                                            16

standard turbidimetric immunoassay techniques.        LDL particle number and particle
size can be determined using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometry.
Remnants lipoproteins and LDL-phospholipase A2 can be determined from EDTA
plasma or serum and serum, respectively, using enzymatic immunoseparation
techniques. Oxidized LDL, intercellular adhesion molecule-i and interleukin-2 levels
can be determined from serum using standard enzyme immunoassay techniques.
These techniques are described in detail in standard textbooks, for example Tietz
Fundamentals of Clinical Chemistry. 6 * Ed. (Burtis, Ashwood and Borter Eds.), WB
Saunders Company.

         [0040] In another embodiment, any of the methods disclosed herein are used in
treatment of a subject or subjects that consume a traditional Western diet. In one
embodiment, the methods of the invention include a step of identifying a subject as a
Western diet consumer or prudent diet consumer and then treating the subject if the
subject is deemed a Western diet consumer. The term "Western diet" herein refers
generally to a typical diet consisting of, by percentage of total calories, about 45% to
about 50% carbohydrate, about 35% to about 40% fat, and about 10% to about 15%
protein. A Western diet may alternately or additionally be characterized by relatively
high intakes of red and processed meats, sweets, refined grains, and desserts, for
example more than 50%, more than 60% or more or 70% of total calories come from
these sources.
         [0041] In another embodiment, any of the methods disclosed herein are used in
treatment of a subject or subjects that consume less than (actual or average) about 150
g, less than about 125 g, less than about 100 g, less than about 75 g, less than about 50
g, less than about 45 g, less than about 40 g, less than about 35 g, less than about 30 g,
less than about 25 g, less than about 20 g or less than about 15 g of fish per day.

treatment of a subject or subjects that consume less than (actual or average) about 10
g, less than about 9 g, less than about 8 g, less than about 7 g, less than about 6 g, less
than about 5 g, less than about 4 g, less than about 3 g, less than about 2 g per day of
omega-3 fatty acids from dietary sources.
         [0043] In another embodiment, any of the methods disclosed herein are used in
treatment of a subject or subjects that consume less than (actual or average) about 2.5
g, less than about 2 g, less than about 1.5 g. less than about 1 g, less than about 0.5 g,
less than about 0.25 g, or less than about 0.2 g per day of EPA and DHA (combined)
from dietary sources.
         [0044] In one embodiment, compositions useful in various embodiments of the
invention comprise a polyunsaturated fatty acid as an active ingredient. In another
embodiment, such compositions comprise EPA as an active ingredient.              The term
"EPA" as used herein refers to eicosapentaenoic acid (e.g. eicosa-5,8,11,14,17
pentaenoic acid) and/or a pharmaceutically acceptable ester, derivative, conjugate or
salt thereof, or mixtures of any of the foregoing.

        [0045] In one embodiment, the EPA comprises all-cis eicosa-5,8,11,14,17
pentaenoic acid.      In another    embodiment, the EPA is        in the form   of an
eicosapentaenoic acid ester. In another embodiment, the EPA comprises a C 1       -  C5
alkyl ester of EPA. In another embodiment, the EPA comprises eicosapentaenoic acid
ethyl ester, eicosapentaenoic acid methyl ester, eicosapentaenoic acid propyl ester, or
eicosapentaenoic acid butyl ester. In still another embodiment, the EPA comprises all
cis eicosa-5,8,11,14,17-pentaenoic acid ethyl ester.
        [0046] In still other embodiments, the EPA comprises ethyl-EPA, lithium
EPA, mono, di- or triglyceride EPA or any other ester or salt of EPA, or the free acid
form of EPA. The EPA may also be in the form of a 2-substituted derivative or other
derivative which slows down its rate of oxidation but does not otherwise change its
biological action to any substantial degree.
        [0047] The term "pharmaceutically acceptable" in the present context means
that the substance in question does not produce unacceptable toxicity to the subject or
interaction with other components of the composition.
        [0048] In one embodiment., EPA present in a composition suitable for use
according to the invention comprises ultra-pure EPA. The term "ultra-pure'" as used

Example 1: Safety and efficacy of ultra-pure EPA
        [0114] A multi-center, placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind. 12-week
study is performed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of >96% E-EPA in patients with
fasting triglyceride levels >  200 mg/dl and < 500 mg/dl despite stain therapy (the
mean of two qualifying entry values needs to be > 185 mg/dl and at least one of the
values needs to be > 200 mg/dl). The primary objective of the study is to determine
the efficacy of >96% E-EPA 2 g daily and 4 g daily, compared to placebo, in lowering
fasting TG levels in patients with high risk for cardiovascular disease and with fasting
TG levels    200 mg/dL and <500 mg/dL, despite treatment to LDL-C goal on statin
therapy.
        [0115] The secondary objectives of this study are the following:

         [0 116] The population for this study is men and women >18 years of age with
a body mass index       45 kg/m 2 with fasting TG levels greater than or equal to 200
mg/dl and less than 500 mg/dl and on a stable does of statin therapy (with or without
ezetimibe). The statin must be atorvostatin, rosuvastatin or simvastatin. The dose of
statin must be stable for > 4 weeks prior to the LDL-C/TG baseline qualifying
measurement for randomization. The statin dose will be optimal such that the patients
are at their LDL-C goal at the LDL-C/TG baseline qualifying measurements.           The
same statin at the same dose will be continued until the study ends.

         [0117] Patients taking any additional non-statin, lipid-altering medications
(niacin >200 mg/day, fibrates, fish oil, other products containing omega-3 fatty acids,
or other herbal products or dietary supplements with potential lipid-altering effects),
either alone or in combination with statin therapy (with or without ezetimibe), must be
able to safely discontinue non-statin, lipid-altering therapy at screening.
         [0118] Patients at high risk for CVD, i.e., patients with clinical coronary heart
disease (CHD) or clinical CHD risk equivalents (10-year risk >20%) as defined in the
National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III)
Guidelines will be eligible to participate in this study. Those include patients with any
of the following criteria: (1) Known CVD, either clinical coronary heart disease
(CHD), symptomatic carotid artery disease (CAD), peripheral artery disease (PAD) or
abdominal aortic aneurism; or (2) Diabetes Mellitus (Type 1 or 2).
         [0119] Approximately 648 patients will be randomized at approximately 80
centers in the U.S.    The study will be a 18- to 20-week, Phase 3, multi-center study
consisting of 2 study periods: (1) A 6- to 8-week screening period that includes a diet
and lifestyle stabilization, a non-statin lipid-altering treatment washout., and an LDL-C
and TG qualifying         period   and   (2)   A    12-week,   double-blind,   randomized,
placebo-controlled treatment period.
         [0120] During the screening period and double-blind treatment period, all
visits are to be within 3 days of the scheduled time. All patients will continue to take
the statin product (with or without ezetimibe) at the same dose they were taking at
screening throughout their participation in the study.
         [0121] The 6- to 8-week screening period includes a diet and lifestyle
stabilization, a non-statin lipid-altering treatment washout, and an LDL-C and TG
qualifying period. The screening visit (Visit 1) will occur for all patients at either 6
weeks (for patients on stable statin therapy [(with or without ezetimibe] at screening)
or 8 weeks (for patients who will require washout of their current non-statin
lipid-altering therapy at screening) before randomization, as follows:
         .   Patients who do not require a washout: The screening visit will occur at
Visit 1 (Week -6). Eligible patients will enter a 4-week diet and lifestyle stabilization
period. At the screening visit, all patients will receive counseling regarding the
importance of the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Therapeutic
                                              27

Lifestyle Changes (TLC) diet and will receive basic instructions on how to follow this
diet.
         0 Patients who will require a washout: The screening visit will occur at Visit
I (Week -8). Eligible patients will begin a 6-week washout period at the screening visit
(i.e. 6 weeks washout before the first LDL-C/TG qualifying visit). Patients will receive
counseling regarding the NCEP TLC diet and will receive basic instructions on how to
follow this diet. Site personnel will contact patients who do not qualify for
participation based on screening laboratory test results to instruct them to resume their
prior lipid-altering medications.
         [0122] At the end of the 4-week diet and lifestyle stabilization period or the 6
week diet and stabilization and washout period, eligible patients will enter the 2-week
LDL-C and TG qualifying period and will have their fasting LDL-C and TG levels
measured at Visit 2 (Week -2) and Visit 3 (Week -1). Eligible patients must have an
average fasting LDL-C level >40 mg/dL and <100 mg/dL and an average fasting TG
level    200 mg/dL and <500 mg/dL to enter the 12-week double-blind treatment
period. The LDL-C and TG levels for qualification will be based on the average
(arithmetic mean) of the Visit 2 (Week -2) and Visit 3 (Week -1) values. If a patient's
average LDL-C and/or TG levels from Visit 2 and Visit 3 fall outside the required
range for entry into the study, an additional fasting lipid profile can be collected
1 week later at Visit 3.1. If a third sample is collected at Visit 3.1, entry into the study
will be based on the average (arithmetic mean) of the values from Visit 3 and Visit 3.1.
         [0123] After confinnation of qualifying fasting LDL-C and TG values, eligible
patients will enter a 12-week, randomized, double-blind treatment period. At Visit 4
(Week 0), patients will be randomly assigned to I of the following treatment groups:
         * >96% E-EPA 2 g daily,
         0 >96% E-EPA 4 g daily, or
         * Placebo.
         [0124] Approximately 216 patients per treatment group will be randomized in
this study. Stratification will be by type of statin (atorvastatin, rosuvastatin or
simvastatin), the presence of diabetes, and gender.

         [0125] During the double-blind treatment period, patients will return to the site
at Visit 5 (Week 4), Visit 6 (Week 11), and Visit 7 (Week 12) for efficacy and safety
evaluations.
         [0126] Eligible patients will be randomly assigned at Visit 4 (Week 0) to
receive orally >96% E-EPA 2 g daily, >96% E-EPA 4 g daily, or placebo.
         [0127] >96% E-EPA is provided in 1 g liquid-filled, oblong, gelatin capsules.
The matching placebo capsule is filled with light liquid paraffin and contains 0 g of
>96% E-EPA . >96% E-EPA capsules are to be taken with food (i.e. with or at the end
of a meal).
         [0128] During the double-blind treatment period, patients will take 2 capsules
(>96% E-EPA or matching placebo) in the morning and 2 capsules in the evening for
a total of 4 capsules per day.
         " Patients in the >96% E-EPA 2 g/day treatment group will receive 1 >96%
E-EPA 1 g capsule and 1 matching placebo capsule in the morning and in the evening.
         * Patients in the >96% E-EPA 4 g/day treatment group will receive 2 >96%
E-EPA 1 g capsules in the morning and evening.
         [0129] Patients in the placebo group will receive 2 matching placebo capsules
in the morning and evening.
         [0130] The primary efficacy variable for the double-blind treatment period is
percent change in TG from baseline to Week 12 endpoint. The secondary efficacy
variables for the double-blind treatment period include the following:

         [0131] Safety assessments will include adverse events, clinical laboratory
measurements (chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis), 12-lead electrocardiograms
(ECGs), vital signs, and physical examinations.
         [0132] For TG, TC, HDL-C, LDL-C, calculated non-HDL-C, and VLDL-C,
baseline will be defined as the average of Visit 4 (Week 0) and the preceding lipid

        [0135] The primary efficacy analysis will be performed using a 2-way analysis
of covariance (ANCOVA) model with treatment as a factor and baseline TG value as a
covariate. The least-squares mean, standard error, and 2-tailed 95% confidence interval
for each treatment group and for each comparison will be estimated. The same 2-way
ANCOVA model will be used for the analysis of secondary efficacy variables.
        [0136] The primary analysis will be repeated for the per-protocol population to
confirm the robustness of the results for the intent-to-treat population.
        [013 7] Non-inferiority tests for percent change from baseline in LDL-C will be
performed between >96% E-EPA doses and placebo using a non-inferiority margin of
6% and a significant level at 0.05.
        [0138] For the following key secondary efficacy parameters, treatment groups
will be compared using Dunnett's test to control the Type 1 error rate: TC, LDL-C,
HDL-C, non-HDL-C, VLDL-C, Lp-PLA2, and apo B. For the remaining secondary
efficacy parameters, Dunnett's test will not be used and the ANCOVA output will be
considered descriptive.
        [0139] The evaluation of safety will be based primarily on the frequency of
adverse events, clinical laboratory assessments, vital signs, and 12-lead ECGs. The
primary efficacy variable is the percent change in fasting TG levels from baseline to
Week 12. A sample size of 194 completed patients per treatment group will provide
90.6% power to detect a difference of 15% between >96% E-EPA              and placebo in
percent change from baseline in fasting TG levels, assuming a standard deviation of
45% in TG measurements and a significance level of p <0.05.
        [0140] Previous data on fasting LDL-C show a difference in percent change
from baseline of 2.2%, with a standard deviation of 15%, between study drug and
placebo. A sample size of 194 completed patients per treatment group will provide
80% power to demonstrate non-inferiority (p <0.05, one-sided) of the LDL-C response
between >96% E-EPA 4 g daily and placebo, within a 6% margin. To accommodate a
10% drop-out rate from randomization to completion of the double-blind treatment
period, a total of 648 randomized patients is planned (216 patients per treatment
group).

Example 2: Improvement of Cognitive Performance in Subjects with Age
Associated Memory Impairment
          [0141] A single-center, 6-week, double-blind, randomizes, parallel-group,
placebo-controlled, dose-ranging pilot study was performed to evaluate the efficacy,
tolerability, and safety of >96% ethyl-EPA in subjects with subjective and objective
memory impairment according to generally accepted criteria for Age-Associated
Memory Impairment ("AAMI"). The primary objective of the study was to determine
the effect of >96% ethyl-EPA 1 g, 2 g, and 4 g daily, compared to placebo, on
cognitive performance in subjects with AAMI.
          [0142] The secondary objectives of this study were the following:
          1. To determine the effect of >96% E-EPA on the following tests in the
computerized cognitive battery:
          " Continuity of attention tasks;
          " Quality of working memory tasks;
          *   Quality of episodic memory tasks; and
          *   Speed of attention tasks;
         2. To determine the safety and tolerability of >96% E-EPA from routine
clinical laboratory tests, adverse events ("AE") monitoring, and vital signs; and
          3. To determine the potential dose-effect relationship of >96% E-EPA on the
cognitive endpoints by measurement of essential fatty acids in plasma and red blood
cell membranes.
          [0143] The population for this study was men and women between ages 50 and
70 with self-reported complaints of memory loss, subjective and objective cognitive
impairment with a score of at least one standard deviation below that of the mean for
age-matched elderly population as determined by the total score of between 13 and 20
from the Paired Associated Learning ("PAL") subset of the Wechsler Memory Scale,
evidence of adequate intellectual function as determined by a scaled score of at least 9
(raw score of at least 32) on the Vocabulary subtest of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence

        [0145] Ninety-four subjects were randomized into one of six groups: 1 g E
EPA daily (n=23), 2 g E-EPA daily (n=24), 4 g E-EPA daily (n=24), 1 g placebo daily
(n=7), 2 g placebo daily (n=8), and 4 g placebo daily (n=8). E-EPA was provided as
500 mg soft gel capsules containing >96% E-EPA and 0.2% dl-a-tocopherol as an
antioxidant.   Placebo capsules contained 467 mg of liquid paraffin and 0.2% dl-a
tocopherol. Ninety-one subjects completed the study. Two subjects in the 2 g E-EPA
group and one subject in the 2 g placebo group discontinued the study.
        [0146] The study consisted of a screening visit, a training visit, and four study
visits. At the screening visit, subjects' eligibility was determined through cognitive
tests (verbal paired associated learning [PAL] subscale,. vocabulary subtest, Memory
Assessment Clinics Questionnaire [MAC-Q]. mini mental state evaluation [MMSE]
and MINI      [mini international neuropsychiatric interview;     sections 1 and 2 of
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition (DSM-IV) plus
dysthymia]), haematology, clinical chemistry and 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG).
At the training visit, subjects were shown how to use the CDR computerized system.
Subjects took study drug for 6 weeks and on Days 0, 14, 28 and 42, subjects
underwent the CDR cognitive test battery.
        [0147] At screening cognitive testing and suitability for the study were
assessed using the Verbal Paired Associates 1 (Wechsler Memory Scale), Vocabulary
Subtest of the WAIS, MAC-Q, MMSE and MINI (DSM-IV Sections 1 and 2 plus
Dysthymia).
        [0148] A selection of tasks from the CDR computerized cognitive assessment
system were administered at Visit 2 (training visit), Visit 3 (baseline), Visit 4 (Day
14), Visit 5 (Day 28) and Visit 6 (Day 42). Parallel forms of the tests were presented
at each testing session. All tasks were computer-controlled, the information presented
on high resolution monitors, and the responses recorded via a response model
containing two buttons: one marked 'no' and the other 'yes'. Five CDR composite
scores were used as the primary/secondary outcome variables. The task titles were:
        *   Word Presentation
        e   Immediate Word Recall
        *   Picture Presentation
        *   Simple Reaction Time

        *  Bond-Lader Visual Analogue Scales of Mood and Alertness
        e   Screen, Using the Computer Mouse
        [0149] To ensure consistency of approach, full training on the cognitive tests
and CDR test battery was provided to study site staff and study subjects. The results
of each variable were automatically recorded using the machine interface developed by
CDR.
        [0150] Blood samples (10 mL) were collected at Visit 1 (screening) and at
Visits 4, 5 and 6. Analysis was performed by MSR Lipid Analysis, Scottish Crop
Research Institute, Dundee, UK. The screening sample acted as baseline for the EFA
measurements. Lipid was extracted from plasma, serum and RBC suspensions and
converted into fatty acid methyl esters which were analyzed by gas chromatography to
give fatty acid profiles as micrograms fatty acid per gram of sample (pgFA/g) and
normalized area percent.
        [0151] All randomized subjects with at least 1 visit post-baseline were
included in the Intent to Treat ("ITT") population, regardless of treatment actually
received.
        [0152] All randomized subjects that completed the study, excluding significant
protocol deviators, were defined as the Safety Per Protocol population. An Efficacy
Per Protocol population was based on the Efficacy completers.     The intercept of the
Safety and Efficacy Per Protocol populations defined the Study Per Protocol
Population.
        [0153] All   randomized subjects that received at least     1 dose of study
medication were included in the Safety Population.
        [0154] Summary statistics were provided for the ITT and Study Per Protocol
Populations separately for all composite scores, major and supportive variables.
                                          35

Summary statistics were performed for both the unadjusted and difference from
baseline data (i.e. the difference from the time matched predose assessments on
Day 0).    Summary statistics were calculated by treatment, day and time-point. The
summary statistics comprised n, mean, median, SD, standard error of mean ("SEM"),
minimum and maximum values.
         [0155] Difference from baseline data for each major variable was evaluated by
an Analysis of Covariance ("ANCOVA") using SAS PROC MIXED Version 8.2.
Fixed effects for treatment, day, time point, treatment by day, treatment by time point,
treatment by day by time-point were fitted. Subject within treatment was fitted as a
repeated effect using the repeated statement. The compound symmetry covariance
structure was used. Subjects' time-matched predose assessments on Day 0 were used
as a covariate in the analysis.
         [0156] Least squares means (LS means) were calculated for treatment by day,
treatment by time-point and treatment by day by time-point interaction. This formal
analysis was conducted for the ITT and Study PP Populations separately.
         [0157] Safety evaluations were based on the safety population.        Safety and
tolerability were assessed in terms of AEs, vital signs, 12-lead ECG, clinical laboratory
data, medical history, and study drug compliance.       Safety and tolerability data were
presented by treatment group.
         [0158] RBC and plasma EFA data were collected at baseline, Day 14, 28 and
42 and summarized by visit for each treatment group.          Change from baseline and
percent change from baseline were also summarized. ANCOVA comparison of ethyl
EPA dose groups and ethyl-EPA versus placebo was performed.

         [0182] A post-hoc analysis compared the individual placebo groups (1 g, 2 g
and 4 g paraffin oil) with the corresponding ethyl-EPA doses.
         [0183] The pattern of data provided evidence that ethyl-EPA 4 g might
improve speed in the attention based measures. For Power of Attention, there was an
overall benefit versus the corresponding placebo for 4 g on Day 42. The subtask
Simple Reaction Time showed improvements in performance for 4 g at PM 2
collapsed across days and at several time-points on Days 14 and 42.                  The
improvements for 4 g were most pronounced in the Choice Reaction Time task, where
there was an overall benefit versus corresponding placebo for 4 g, reflecting a benefit
for 4 g over placebo on all study days.    The pattern of improvement in performance
throughout the assessment days was quite convincing as the improvements began on
Day 14 with improvements seen at 2 time points, whereas on Day 42 ethyl-EPA 4 g
was superior to placebo at every time point.
         [0184] For   Continuity   of Attention,   there  were    isolated  declines   or
improvements in performance, but there was no general pattern of effects and it was
considered unlikely these differences were due to the study compound. For Quality of
Working Memory and in the subtask measure Numeric Working Memory Sensitivity
                                           40

Index, there were, as in the original analyses, only isolated improvements and declines
in performance that were most likely not treatment-related.        However, for Spatial
Working Memory Sensitivity Index, there was an overall benefit for ethyl-EPA 4 g
over placebo on Day 42 in the Study PP Population, which corresponds to the
improvements seen for the attention based measures.
        [0185] For Quality of Episodic Secondary Memory and contributing subtasks,
there were a number of decreases for ethyl-EPA that could be explained by the pre
existing differences in performance between the placebo and active treatment groups
which was seen in the original analyses. In contrast to the original analysis, the subtask
measures of Speed of Memory showed some signs of improvement in performance for
active treatment, mostly for I g versus placebo. For Self-rated Alertness and Self-rated
Contentment, the 1 g dose showed decreases in ratings on Days 14 and 28. However,
these decreases were not correlated with a decline in performance in the CDR attention
tasks. As with the original planned analysis, there were no differences between active
treatment and placebo in Self-Rated Calmness.
Safety Results
        [0186] Subjects who used less than 80% of the prescribed dose were to be
considered non-compliant; other than those subjects who withdrew for other reasons
only 1 subject fell into this category and was withdrawn.
        [0187] Overall, 139 treatment emergent AEs ("TEAEs") were reported by 62
(66.0%) of subjects during the study. Most TEAEs were considered mild in severity
and unrelated to study drug. More TEAEs were reported for the ethyl-EPA treatment
groups (105 events) compared to the placebo treatment groups (34 events). One SAE
was reported for the ethyl EPA 2 g treatment group and 3 subjects discontinued due to
TEAEs: 2 subjects from the ethyl-EPA 2 g treatment group (the primary reason for
discontinuation for 1 of these subjects was non-compliance), and 1 subject from the
placebo 2 g treatment group.
        [0188] There were no deaths during the study. No TEAEs were Definitely
Related to the study drug. One subject receiving 1 g ethyl-EPA experienced nausea
that was Probably Related to the study drug. Another subject receiving 4 g ethyl-EPA
experienced diarrhea that was Probably Related to the study drug; another subject
receiving 2 g placebo also experienced diarrhea that was Probably Related to the study

drug. Five subjects experienced nausea that was Possibly Related to the study drug;
two were in the 1 g ethyl-EPA cohort; one was in the 2 g ethyl-EPA cohort: two were
in the 4 g ethyl-EPA cohort. One subject receiving 2 g placebo experienced headache
that was Possibly Related to the study drug. All other TEAEs were Not Related or
Unlikely Related to the study drug, and included nasopharyngitis (n=3), cystitis (n=2),
cough (n=7), toothache (n=2), pharyngolaryngeal pain (n=2), back pain (n=2),
pollakiuria (n=2), influenza-like illness (n=2), headache (n=15), diarrhea (n=2), and
nausea (n=1).
        [0189] One subject with a history of transient ischaemic attack, hypertension
and osteoarthritis of the hand and osteopaenia receiving 2 g ethyl-EPA experienced
worsening epigastric chest pain 17 days after the start of the study and 9 days after the
last dose of the study drug. A planned endoscopy revealed oesophagitis and a small
hiatus hernia. The subject was treated with omeprazole, which settled her symptoms.
The subject had taken felodipine, rosuvastatin, aspirin, glucosanine, and quinine
within 14 days of the onset of her symptoms. The study investigator determined that
her symptoms were unrelated to the study drug and withdrew the subject from the
study. No other Serious Adverse Events occurred during the study.
        [0190] Essential fatty acid parameters in plasma and RBCs was measured at
baseline and on Day 14, 28 and 48 (shown in Tables 1 - 6). Notable changes for these
parameters occurred in the ethyl-EPA treatment groups at Days 14. 28 and 42
compared to placebo. EPA, DPAn-3 and EPA/AA ratio values increased substantially
from baseline, in plasma and RBC, to Day 42 for the ethyl-EPA 1, 2 and 4 g treatment
groups, but remained similar to baseline in the placebo treatment groups. AA, DHA
and DGLA values decreased substantially from baseline, in plasma and RBC, to day
42 for the ethyl EPA 1, 2 and 4 g treatment groups, but remained similar to baseline in
the placebo treatment groups.     The difference in EPA, AA (RBC only), DPAn-3,
DGLA (1 g only for plasma) and EPA/AA ratio levels in the plasma and RBC were
significantly (LS means, p<0.05) different for the ethyl-EPA 4 g treatment group
compared to the ethyl-EPA 1 g and 2 g treatment groups.

than the placebo controlled subject.
        Paragraph 5: The method of paragraph 3 wherein upon administering the
composition to the subject daily for a period of 12 weeks and maintaining the placebo
controlled subject on stable statin therapy without concomitant ultra-pure EPA therapy
for a period of 12 weeks, the subject exhibits an at least 10% lower serum LDL-C level
than the placebo controlled subject.
        Paragraph 6: The method of paragraph 3 wherein upon administering the
composition to the subject daily for a period of 12 weeks and maintaining the placebo
controlled subject on stable statin therapy without concomitant ultra-pure EPA therapy
for a period of 12 weeks, the subject exhibits at least 10% lower fasting triglycerides
than the placebo controlled subject.
        Paragraph 7: The method of paragraph 3 wherein upon administering the
composition to the subject daily for a period of 12 weeks and maintaining the placebo
controlled subject on stable statin therapy without concomitant ultra-pure EPA therapy
for a period of 12 weeks, the subject exhibits at least 15% lower fasting triglycerides
than the placebo controlled subject.
