TECHNICAL FIELD
[0001]     The present disclosure relates to a connecting structure for a circuit board and an
output terminal of a power supply.
BACKGROUNDART
[0002]     On some festival days, LED light strings are usually needed to increase holiday
spirit. An LED light string needs to be driven by a driving power supply, so that LED lights
emit light in various flashing modes. Existing driving power supplies include vertical and
horizontal power supplies. A vertical driving power supply for a lamp, as disclosed in the
invention patent with the Publication No. CN105338703A, as shown in FIG. I and FIG 2,
comprises a casing 1 and a tail cover 2 which are integrally formed. One end of the casing 1 is
closed, and the other end has an opening. The tail cover 2 and the open end of the casing 1 are
fixedly connected. The tail cover 2 is provided with a hole. The vertical driving power supply
further comprises a circuit board 3 with a control circuit, a switch 4 for generating a pulse
signal, and a seal 5, wherein at least part of the circuit board 3 is installed in a cavity of the
casing 1, one end of the switch 4 is welded and fixed to the circuit board 3, the other end of
the switch 4 is a free end, the seal 5 is installed in the hole of the tail cover to seal the hole,
after the tail cover 2 and the casing 1 are fixed, the seal 5 abuts against the free end of the
switch 4, and one end of the seal 5 is exposed in the air.
[0003]     In the above driving power supply, an output waterproof socket 2a is arranged on
the tail cover 2, and a conductive pin is arranged in the waterproof socket 2a. As can be
directly seen from FIG. 2, the conductive pin is electrically connected with an output end of
the circuit board 3 through a wire. Although such a connection method achieves the purpose
of conduction, during assembly, since the conductive pin and the waterproof socket 2a are
fixed and integrated firstly, and then the conductive pin is welded to the output end of the

                                                2
circuit board 3 through the wire, obviously, the length of the wire must not be too long, as a
result, the space between the circuit board 3 and the tail cover 2 is compressed by a large
margin, and welding in such a small space not only increases the operation difficulty of
operators, but also requires much time and effort.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
[0023]     As shown in FIG. 3, a connecting structure for a circuit board and an output terminal
of a power supply according to the an embodiment comprises a casing 11, a tail cover 12, and
the circuit board 13 with a control circuit, one end of the casing 11 has an opening, at least
part of the circuit board 13 is installed in a cavity of the casing 11, and the control circuit on
the circuit board 13 may be any one disclosed in the Publication No. CN105338703A, and
may also be the circuit disclosed in Patent Application No. <removed-apn>770 and the like. The
output terminal is arranged on the tail cover 12, the output terminal at least comprises a
conductive pin 14, the output terminal further comprises an insertion base 15 which is fixed to
the tail cover to form an integral body, the other end of the conductive pin 14 is provided with
a slot 14a, and the conductive pin 14 is provided with a toothed component 14b. The insertion
base 15 is formed on the toothed component 14b of the conductive pin and the end with the

                                                5
slot 14a through injection molding. The conductive pin 14 and the insertion base 15 are firmly
combined by means of the toothed component 14b, and the conductive pin 14 can be
prevented from moving relative to the insertion base 15.
[0024]     The connecting structure further comprises a conductive insertion component 16,
the insertion component 16 is fixed to an output end of the circuit board, and when the tail
cover 12 and the open end of the casing 11 are closed, the end of the conductive pin 14 is
inserted into the insertion component 16 to allow the circuit board 13 and the output terminal
to be electrically connected. The insertion component comprises a body 16a having a
V-shaped cross section. One end of the body 16a is provided with plug pins 16b connected
with the circuit board 13. After being inserted in the circuit board 13, the plug pins 16b are
fixed to the circuit board 13 by welding, so that the whole of the insertion component 16 is
fixed to the circuit board 13 to form an integral body. The body 16a is provided with a
connecting component allowing the end of the conductive pin 14 to be inserted therein, the
body 16a is provided with a notch, and the connecting component is located at the notch.
Preferably, after the conductive pin 14 is inserted into the connecting component, the
connecting component is expanded. The connecting component comprises a first clamp block
16c and a second clamp block 16d. The first clamp block 16c and the second clamp block 16d
are oppositely disposed on the body 16a and are not parallel to each other. One end of the first
clamp block 16c and one end of the second clamp block 16d are both connected with the body
16a, and the other end of the first clamp block 16c and the other end of the second clamp
block 16d are free ends. Because the first clamp block 16c and the second clamp block 16d
each have a free end, when the conductive pin 14 is inserted into the space between the first
clamp block 16c and the second clamp block 16d, the first clamp block 16c and the second
clamp block 16c will be elastically deformed, and since the first clamp block 16c and the
second clamp block 16d are not parallel to each other, an included angle is formed between
the first clamp block 16c and the second clamp block 16d. Thus, the conductive pin 14 can
expand the connecting component more easily. In other words, the first clamp block 16c and
the second clamp block 16d can more easily clamp the conductive pin 14, thereby ensuring
the transmission of electric signals. As for the unparallel relationship between the first clamp

                                                  6
block 16c and the second clamp block 16d, preferably, the first clamp block 16c and the
second clamp block 16d are arranged on the body 16a in a splayed mode, that is to say, the
first clamp block 16c and the second clamp block 16d are disposed on the body 16a in a
mirror-symmetrical mode.
[0025]     The present disclosure is not limited to the above embodiment. As shown in FIG. 6,
the body 16a has a U-shaped cross section, and the connecting component is located at the
other end of the body 16a.
[0026]     The present disclosure is not limited to the above embodiment. As shown in FIG. 7,
the insertion component 16 is composed of a body 16a and a connecting component fixed on
the body 16a. The body 16a has a rectangular cross section, and the connecting component is
a ring with an opening. An insertion port of the ring is provided with a ramp for guiding the
conductive pin 14, and the conductive pin 14 is inserted into the ring 16e so as to expand the
ring.
[0027]     The present disclosure is not limited to the above embodiment. As shown in FIG. 8,
the insertion component 16 comprises a body 16a. An insertion hole 16f is formed in the body
16a. The insertion hole 16f comprises a tapered hole section. The insertion hole 16f may also
comprises a straight hole section connected with the tapered hole section. When the insertion
hole 16f only has a tapered hole section, the tapered hole section is used for guiding and
expanding the conductive pin 14, and when the insertion hole 16f is composed of a tapered
hole section and a straight hole section, the tapered hole section is used for guiding the
conductive pin 14, and the straight hole section is used for expanding the conductive pin 14.
[0028]     As shown in FIG. 3 and FIG 4, a power supply according to the present disclosure
comprises any one of the connecting structures in the above embodiments. The power supply
according to the embodiments described herein can be applied to the driving of LED lights or
LED light strings, so that the LED lights or LED light strings emit light in various flashing
modes.

an acknowledgement of any form of suggestion that such prior art forms part of the common

                                                  7
general knowledge.
