                                           FIELD OF THE INVENTION
 0           The      present         invention            relates         to      the       field         of      medical
   images.
                                                      BACKGROUND
             A      computerized                tomography               (CT)          scan          acquires              the
   radiodensity, also                  termed radiopacity, of                       the scanned portion of
 5 anatomy.             Radiodensity              is    measured           in     Hounsfield              units         (HU),
   with       air     having       HU    =    -1000,       water       having         HU   =    0,      and      cortical
   bone         having        HU     =      +3000.             In      a      CT      image,          the        acquired
   radiodensity              values        are     mapped         to    different            grayscale             values.
   Typically,           in     a   CT    image,        air     is     presented           in    black,           cortical
-0 bone in white, and other materials in varying shades of gray.
             Traditionally,                  interventional                 radiologists                   have          been
   trained         to   navigate          the     head of         a   subject         using      two-dimensional
    (2D) images            of the head.              For example, during a sinus procedure,
   the      interventional              radiologist            may      refer        to    three         computerized
25 tomography            (CT)    slices        of    the     subject's           head:       an     axial       slice,       a
   coronal slice, and a sagittal slice.
             US      Patent        8,532,738,             whose        disclosure              is        incorporated
   herein         by   reference,           describes          a    method,         including            constructing
   a    simulated          surface       of     a   body cavity,             and      pressing          a   distal         end
30 of a probe           against a wall of                  the body cavity. While pressing the
                                                               1

   distal        end     against        the     wall,        position           measurements             are      accepted
   from       the     probe       indicating            a    position            of     the     probe        within        the
   body      cavity,         and    force       measurements                are     accepted         from the           probe
   indicating             a    force       between           the       distal         end       and      the      wall.       A
 5 distortion            in    the     simulated           surface           is    created         at    the      position
   indicated            by      the      position            measurements,                   so     as     to       form       a
   distorted           surface,         upon        detecting             that       the      force      measurements
   exceed          a    predefined             amount.          The        distorted            surface           is      then
   displayed.
 0           US      Patent         7,924,279,             whose           disclosure             is      incorporated
   herein        by     reference,            describes            a     system        for      visualizing              a  3D
   volume,         in particular              for medical applications,                           that      includes an
   input       for     receiving a three-dimensional                               set of data representing
   voxel       values         of    the       3D    volume.           The       data       set     is    stored          in    a
 5 storage.          A    processor          projects          the        volume        onto      an     imaginary          2D
   projection screen                 from a predetermined viewpoint.                                 For each pixel
   of     the    2D projection               image       a   ray      is      cast     through         the      pixel      and
   through          the     volume.        A    protocol           is      used      that,       while        traversing
   along       ray      positions          within          the     volume,           determines            a    rendering
 0 algorithm           and/or       rendering            parameters             in    dependence             on    the     ray
   position.             For      each        ray        position              the      determined              rendering
   algorithm/parameters                    are      used      to      calculate            a   contribution              to    a
   pixel        value        of    the     pixel         based        on       at    least       one      voxel         value
   within        a   predetermined              range        of     the      ray     position.          An      output      is
25 used for providing pixel values of a 2D                                         image for          rendering on a

            In   some   embodiments,         the   processor          is    configured          to   render
   the wall of the cavity in color.
            In    some    embodiments,         the    wall      of      the    cavity         is   located
   behind a location at which the image slice was acquired.
 5          In     some    embodiments,          the     image           slice       is     a     computed
   tomography         (CT) image slice.

                                                              OVERVIEW
             As     noted        above,          interventional                 radiologists              typically         use
   2D    images         (or "slices")                for navigation.                    A   challenge in using 2D
   images,          however,           is     the      lack        of    depth       information            contained         in
 0 such       images.            For       example,            when       using       2D    images        to     navigate       a
   catheter           within         an      anatomical               cavity,         it     may     be     difficult         to
   ascertain           the     distance            between           the     catheter          and     the    wall      of   the
   cavity.
             Embodiments                  of        the         present            invention              address          this
25 challenge,            by     providing              an     enhanced           presentation             of     anatomical
   cavities            in    2D       images.               In       this      enhanced           presentation,              the
   cavity         is     given          a    three-dimensional                     (3D)       appearance,             via    the
   incorporation                 of       morphological                   information             from       beneath         the
   displayed           2D     slice.            For       example,           a   processor           may     "illuminate"

              Reference is           initially made to Fig.                      1, which is             a schematic
   illustration            of    a    system       20    for    guiding         a    medical         procedure,         in
   accordance with some embodiments of the present invention.
 5            Fig.      1 depicts         a    physician         26    performing             a   procedure          on   a
   subject           22.      During          this     procedure,             physician            26     inserts       an
   intrabody            tool     28,       such      as    a    catheter,            into        a    nasal       cavity
   and/or         a    sinus    of     subject        22,     and     then      uses        tool      28    to    probe,
   and/or         operate       on,      the      nasal      cavity        and/or         sinus.           Typically,
 0 the      location       and      orientation           of    the     tool      is     tracked,         using,       for
   example,           a magnetic tracking system.                          For     example,           system 20       may
   comprise           one or more          magnetic-field              generators            24,     which,       during
   the       procedure,            generate          respective             magnetic            fields.             These
   fields           induce      respective             voltages           in     one        or     more       magnetic
25 sensors          coupled to          tool      28.      Based on these                induced voltages,                a
   processor 34            ascertains            the    location and orientation of the tool
   with respect to the coordinate system of the tracking system.
              Typically,           prior         to     the       procedure,              a     volume          of     the
   subject's            head    is     acquired,          using,        for      example,           a   CT    scanner.
30 Subsequently,             during         the    procedure,          processor            34     displays,         on   a
   display          30,   at    least        one    image      slice        32,     taken       from      the     volume
   and      enhanced        as     described         below.          The      physician           may     then      refer
   to      slice       32,    in     deciding          how     to     best       navigate           the      subject's

   volume        of    the      subject's           head       may    be      acquired,             by      acquiring           a
 0 stack         of        sagittal             image          slices           at        successive                 depths.
   Subsequently,             processor           34   may derive           an     "image          slice"        from this
   volume,        by    taking         any    one     of    the    original            sagittal           image        slices

   anatomical              cavity.               Typically,           prior       to     the      procedure,           the
   processor           iterates           over       all      of   the     relevant        image     slices         (both
 0 original          and derived),                and modifies            each cavity-containing                   image
   slice       as     described herein.                       Subsequently,           during the          procedure,
   the      processor             continually              monitors         the    location         of    the      tool,
   and,      if the         location          of     the      tool   has     changed, the           processor may
   retrieve          and display one                  or more modified image                    slices      that pass
 5 through         the      new      location            of    the    tool.         (It     is    noted      that      the
   processor           may      alternatively                modify      an   image      slice,      as     described
   herein,         in     real-time,             immediately           prior     to     displaying         the     image
   slice.)
            Typically,               the      processor           computes         representation                44,    by
 0 rendering             the       wall         of       the     cavity.            First,         the      processor
   ascertains            the      form of         the wall from the three-dimensional                              image
   from which             image       slice        31    was     derived.         The processor            then uses
   any      suitable             rendering            technique           to    render          the   wall.            For
   example,           the     processor             may      illuminate         the     wall      with     a   virtual
25 light       source,         and render the wall                    in accordance with the view of
   a   virtual         camera         positioned             near    the virtual           light     source.           The
   processor            then        replaces           the      void     in    image      slice      31      with      the
   rendering.               Typically,              the      wall    is     rendered        in    color,       to    help
   the      physician            differentiate                 between       the    anatomical           cavity        and
30 the surrounding tissue.
            Typically,              the     processor           does     not    modify        other    portions         of
   image        slice        31,       such       as     region       38     of   the      image     slice.            For
   example,          the      processor            may      not   modify       any     portion       of    the     image
   slice,         other        than       the       portion       corresponding              to   the     anatomical
                                                                  8

   cavity.            Modified             image        slice          32    is    thus,      typically,           a   "hybrid"
   image,         in     that       region         38      is     shown         as   a  two-dimensional                surface,
   in      grayscale,                while          the        wall          of     the     anatomical              cavity          is
   rendered as a three-dimensional surface, typically in color.

   illustration at                    the bottom of Fig. 2, which reproduces a portion
   of modified image slice 32.
              Typically,                the       processor                further         overlays,            on     modified

 0 particular,                the       distal          end       thereof)           on    a    portion          of    modified
   image        slice       32      that corresponds to the                            location of the                intrabody
   tool        within            the     anatomical                cavity.             Typically,            the     processor
   also       overlays a marker 42                          on a portion of representation 44                                  that
   corresponds to a                     location at which the                          intrabody tool would meet
 5 the      wall,        were       the       intrabody             tool        to   continue        moving        toward the

   For example,                 the processor may project a virtual                                       ray 46 from the
   distal tip of                  the intrabody tool,                         identify the            location at which
