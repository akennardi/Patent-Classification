                           Detailed Description including Best Mode
[0026]    Where reference is made in any one or more of the accompanying drawings to
steps and/or features, which have the same reference numerals, those steps and/or features
have for the purposes of this description the same function(s) or operation(s), unless the
contrary intention appears.
[0027]    It is to be noted that the discussions contained in the "Background" section and that
above relating to prior art arrangements relate to discussions of documents or devices which
form public knowledge through their respective publication and/or use. Such should not be
interpreted as a representation by the present inventor(s) or the patent applicant that such
documents or devices in any way form part of the common general knowledge in the art.
[0028]    Fig. 1 is a block diagram depicting one example 100 of a system upon which the
disclosed DPVSC arrangements can be performed. A DPVSC server 101 communicates,
using either a communication network 107 or using one or more portable memory modules
1312 (see Fig. 13) such as USB flash drives (not shown), with a number of fitness studios
109, 111 by means of the associated studio computers such as 114. Each studio 111 has a
local communication network 112 enabling the studio computer 114 to communicate with a
number of displays 117 that are distributed throughout the studio 111. These displays may,
as depicted by a display 119, have a number of individually addressable display windows
120, 121. Exercise stations 128, 129, 130...131 are distributed throughout the studio 111,
and each station such as 128 is located within easy view, and thus associated, with a display
117 or a display window 120.
[0029]    In operation, the exercise stations 128 and their associated fitness equipment (eg a
high bar 1207 in Fig. 12) if any, are physically distributed throughout the studio 111 on a
periodic basis. The periodic distribution (also referred to as configuration) can be performed
on any convenient and desirable basis, eg daily, weekly, or other. The configuration is
typically performed on a daily basis, and the remainder of this description will refer to daily
reconfiguration. This is clearly merely one example, and is not limiting.
[0030]    The daily reconfiguration is based, for each studio, upon daily current studio
information 213 (eg see 213 in Fig. 2) that is downloaded from a multi-period fitness library

                                                   5
104 stored in a data base 105 that communicates with the server 101. The daily current
studio information 213 provides daily variation along a number of different dimensions,
including the type of exercise performed, the equipment used, the location of the associated
exercise stations within the studio, the work times and rest times associated with each
exercise, the number of repetitions and so on. This daily variation helps maintain the interest
and motivation of the studio users such as 1315, with the intention of increasing the
likelihood that the users will maintain an ongoing program of exercise routines.
[0031]    While in some DPVSC examples the displays 117, 119, 123 may be rearranged
throughout the studio 111 on a daily basis, typically the stations 128, 129... 130, 131 are
rearranged while the displays such as 117 remain fixed in their positions. Users performing
fitness routines at the exercise stations 128 are instructed, implicitly by proximity of the
stations 128 to associated displays 117, or by other means such as information 1205 (see
Fig. 12) on the displays, or by training staff in the studio (not shown), to direct their attention
to respective displays (such as 117) or display windows (such as 120) in order to receive
instructions directing them how to perform each exercise of their corresponding exercise
routine.
[0032]    The DPVSC server 101 executes a DPVSC software application 103 in order to
perform the disclosed DPVSC methods. As described hereinafter in more detail with respect
to Fig. 10, the daily studio-specific fitness information 213 is extracted from a multi-period
fitness library file 104 that is stored on the DPVSC server database 105.
[0033]     Inter-studio variation is achieved, in some DPVSC arrangements, because each
studio typically registers with a DPVSC service on a different date. In one DPVSC example,
described hereinafter in more detail with reference to Fig. 10, the initial registration date
dictates which studio specific fitness information 213 is downloaded by the DPVSC server
101 to the studio. Dates upon which studios register with the DPVSC arrangement in the
program are, in the example shown in Fig. 1, stored in a studio information file 129 that is
stored on a database 128.
[0034]    The DPVSC service provider can control operation of the DPVSC arrangements via
a user interface such as a keyboard 402 associated with the DPVSC server 101 (eg see Fig.
4A). Alternatively, the DPVSC service provider may use a portable terminal 132 which
communicates with the DPVSC server 101 over the communication network 107 in order to
perform various control operations. The portable terminal 132 can run a special purpose

                                                6
DPVSC application in order to communicate with the DPVSC server 101. Alternately, the
portable terminal 132 can run a browser application to communicate with suitable software
running on the DPVSC server 101.
[0035]    A studio operator (not shown) can edit the downloaded daily fitness information 213
via a user interface such as a keyboard (not shown) which communicates with the studio
computer 114. Alternatively, the studio operator can use a portable terminal 125 in order to
effect such editing operations. The portable terminal 125 can run a special purpose DPVSC
application in order to communicate with the studio computer 114. Alternately, the portable
terminal 125 can run a browser application to communicate with suitable software running on
the studio computer 114.
[0036]    As described hereinafter in more detail in regard to Fig. 3, the studio operator (not
shown) downloads the current studio-specific fitness information 213 into a studio database
124. The studio operator can modify the downloaded fitness information 213 prior to
communicating the fitness information 213 to the studio displays 117, 119, 123. Once the
fitness information 213, or an edited version thereof, is communicated to the aforementioned
displays, users of the studio can commence their exercise routines, as directed by
information displayed on the aforementioned displays 117, 119, 123.
[0037]    The DPVSC server 101 executes the DPVSC software 103 and communicates, as
depicted by a connection 102, with the communication network 107. The server database
105, which stores the multi-period fitness library 104, communicates with the communication
network 107 as depicted by a connection 106. The database 128, storing the studio
information 129 which includes at least the initial registration date each studio registered with
the DPVSC arrangement, communicates with the network 107 as depicted by a connection
130. The remote studio 109 communicates with the communication network 107 as depicted
by a connection 108. The remote studio 109 can receive the studio information from the
database 128 either directly from the server over the network 107, or alternately, via one or
more portable memory modules 1312 such as USB flash drives, to which the studio
information has previously been downloaded either locally via a suitable communication port
at the server 101, or from the server 101 via the network 107. After the studio information is
downloaded to the one or more portable memory modules 1312, the one or more portable
memory modules 1312 communicate the downloaded studio information to a desired remote
studio such as 111 preferably via a communication port at the studio computer 114. The
portable terminal 125 executing the studio software 127 communicates with the network 107

                                                 7
as depicted by a connection 126. The portable terminal 132 communicates with the network
107 as depicted by a connection 133. The studio 111, by means of the studio computer 114
which executes the studio software 115, communicates with the network 107 as depicted by
a connection 110 and communicates with the one or more portable memory modules 1312
via a suitable communications port (not shown) at the studio computer 114. The studio
computer 114 communicates with the local communication network 112 as depicted by a
connection 113. The display 117 communicates with the network 112 as depicted by a
connection 116. The set of display windows 119, 120, 121 communicate with the network
112 as depicted by a connection 118. The display 123 communicates with the network 112
as depicted by a connection 122.
[0038]    Figs. 4A and 4B depict a general-purpose computer system 400, upon which the
various arrangements described can be practiced.
[0039]    As seen in Fig. 4A, the computer system 400 includes: a computer module 101
acting as the DPVSC server; input devices such as a keyboard 402, a mouse pointer
device 403, a scanner 426, a camera 427, and a microphone 480; and output devices
including a printer 415, a display device 414 and loudspeakers 417. An external Modulator
Demodulator (Modem) transceiver device 416 may be used by the computer module 101 for
communicating to and from a communications network 107 via a connection 421. The
communications network 107 may be a wide-area network (WAN), such as the Internet, a
cellular telecommunications network, or a private WAN. Where the connection 421 is a
telephone line, the modem 416 may be a traditional "dial-up" modem. Alternatively, where
the connection 421 is a high capacity (e.g., cable) connection, the modem 416 may be a
broadband modem. A wireless modem may also be used for wireless connection to the
communications network 107.
[0040]    The server 101 typically includes at least one processor unit 405, and a memory
unit 406. For example, the memory unit 406 may have semiconductor random access
memory (RAM) and semiconductor read only memory (ROM). The server 101 also includes
an number of input/output (1/O) interfaces including: an audio-video interface 407 that
couples to the video display 414, loudspeakers 417 and microphone 480; an 1/O
interface 413 that couples to the keyboard 402, mouse 403, scanner 426, camera 427 and
optionally a joystick or other human interface device (not illustrated); and an interface 408 for
the external modem 416 and printer 415. In some implementations, the modem 416 may be
incorporated within the computer module 101, for example within the interface 408. The

                                                  8
computer module 101 also has a local network interface 411, which permits coupling of the
computer system 400 via a connection 423 to a local-area communications network 422,
known as a Local Area Network (LAN). As illustrated in Fig. 4A, the local communications
network 422 may also couple to the wide network 107 via a connection 424, which would
typically include a so-called "firewall" device or device of similar functionality. The local
network interface 411 may comprise an Ethernet circuit card, a Bluetooth* wireless
arrangement or an IEEE 802.11 wireless arrangement; however, numerous other types of
interfaces may be practiced for the interface 411.
[0041]     The 1/O interfaces 408 and 413 may afford either or both of serial and parallel
connectivity, the former typically being implemented according to the Universal Serial Bus
(USB) standards and having corresponding USB connectors (not illustrated). Storage
devices 409 are provided and typically include a hard disk drive (HDD) 410. Other storage
devices such as a floppy disk drive and a magnetic tape drive (not illustrated) may also be
used. An optical disk drive 412 is typically provided to act as a non-volatile source of data.
Portable memory devices, such optical disks (e.g., CD-ROM, DVD, Blu-ray DiscTM), USB
RAM, portable, external hard drives, and floppy disks, for example, may be used as
appropriate sources of data to the system 400.
[0042]     The components 405 to 413 of the computer module 101 typically communicate via
an interconnected bus 404 and in a manner that results in a conventional mode of operation
of the computer system 400 known to those in the relevant art. For example, the
processor 405 is coupled to the system bus 404 using a connection 418. Likewise, the
memory 406 and optical disk drive 412 are coupled to the system bus 404 by
connections 419. Examples of computers on which the described arrangements can be
practised include IBM-PC's and compatibles, Sun Sparcstations, Apple MaCTM or a like
computer systems.
[0043]     The DPVSC methods may be implemented using the computer system 400 wherein
the processes of Figs. 2 and 3, to be described, may be implemented as one or more
software application programs 103 executable within the computer system 400. In particular,
the steps of the DPVSC method are effected by instructions 431 (see Fig. 4B) in the
software 103 that are carried out within the computer system 400. The software
instructions 431 may be formed as one or more code modules, each for performing one or
more particular tasks. The software may also be divided into two separate parts, in which a
first part and the corresponding code modules performs the DPVSC methods and a second

                                                 9
part and the corresponding code modules manage a user interface between the first part and
the user.
[0044]    The software may be stored in a computer readable medium, including the storage
devices described below, for example. The software is loaded into the computer system 400
from the computer readable medium, and then executed by the computer system 400. A
computer readable medium having such software or computer program recorded on the
computer readable medium is a computer program product. The use of the computer
program product in the computer system 400 preferably effects an advantageous DPVSC
apparatus.
[0045]    The software 103 is typically stored in the HDD 410 or the memory 406. The
software is loaded into the computer system 400 from a computer readable medium, and
executed by the computer system 400. Thus, for example, the software 103 may be stored
on an optically readable disk storage medium (e.g., CD-ROM) 425 that is read by the optical
disk drive 412. A computer readable medium having such software or computer program
recorded on it is a computer program product. The use of the computer program product in
the computer system 400 preferably effects a DPVSC apparatus.
[0046]    In some instances, the application programs 103 may be supplied to the user
encoded on one or more CD-ROMs 425 and read via the corresponding drive 412, or
alternatively may be read by the user from the networks 107 or 422. Still further, the
software can also be loaded into the computer system 400 from other computer readable
media. Computer readable storage media refers to any non-transitory tangible storage
medium that provides recorded instructions and/or data to the computer system 400 for
execution and/or processing. Examples of such storage media include floppy disks,
magnetic tape, CD-ROM, DVD, Blu-ray TM Disc, a hard disk drive, a ROM or integrated circuit,
USB memory, a magneto-optical disk, or a computer readable card such as a PCMCIA card
and the like, whether or not such devices are internal or external of the computer
module 101. Examples of transitory or non-tangible computer readable transmission media
that may also participate in the provision of software, application programs, instructions
and/or data to the computer module 101 include radio or infra-red transmission channels as
well as a network connection to another computer or networked device, and the Internet or
Intranets including e-mail transmissions and information recorded on Websites and the like.

                                                10
[0047]    The second part of the application programs 103 and the corresponding code
modules mentioned above may be executed to implement one or more graphical user
interfaces (GUls) to be rendered or otherwise represented upon the display 414. Through
manipulation of typically the keyboard 402 and the mouse 403, a user of the computer
system 400 and the application may manipulate the interface in a functionally adaptable
manner to provide controlling commands and/or input to the applications associated with the
GUI(s). Other forms of functionally adaptable user interfaces may also be implemented,
such as an audio interface utilizing speech prompts output via the loudspeakers 417 and
user voice commands input via the microphone 480.
[0048]    Fig. 4B is a detailed schematic block diagram of the processor 405 and a
"memory" 434. The memory 434 represents a logical aggregation of all the memory modules
(including the HDD 409 and semiconductor memory 406) that can be accessed by the
computer module 101 in Fig. 4A.
[0049]    When the computer module 101 is initially powered up, a power-on self-test (POST)
program 450 executes. The POST program 450 is typically stored in a ROM 449 of the
semiconductor memory 406 of Fig. 4A. A hardware device such as the ROM 449 storing
software is sometimes referred to as firmware. The POST program 450 examines hardware
within the computer module 101 to ensure proper functioning and typically checks the
processor 405, the memory 434 (409, 406), and a basic input-output systems software
(BIOS) module 451, also typically stored in the ROM 449, for correct operation. Once the
POST program 450 has run successfully, the BIOS 451 activates the hard disk drive 410 of
Fig. 4A. Activation of the hard disk drive 410 causes a bootstrap loader program 452 that is
resident on the hard disk drive 410 to execute via the processor 405. This loads an
operating system 453 into the RAM memory 406, upon which the operating system 453
commences operation. The operating system 453 is a system level application, executable
by the processor 405, to fulfil various high level functions, including processor management,
memory management, device management, storage management, software application
interface, and generic user interface.
[0050]    The operating system 453 manages the memory 434 (409, 406) to ensure that each
process or application running on the computer module 101 has sufficient memory in which
to execute without colliding with memory allocated to another process. Furthermore, the
different types of memory available in the system 400 of Fig. 4A must be used properly so
that each process can run effectively. Accordingly, the aggregated memory 434 is not

                                                11
intended to illustrate how particular segments of memory are allocated (unless otherwise
stated), but rather to provide a general view of the memory accessible by the computer
system 400 and how such is used.
[0051]    As shown in Fig. 4B, the processor 405 includes a number of functional modules
including a control unit 439, an arithmetic logic unit (ALU) 440, and a local or internal
memory 448, sometimes called a cache memory. The cache memory 448 typically includes
a number of storage registers 444 - 446 in a register section. One or more internal
busses 441 functionally interconnect these functional modules. The processor 405 typically
also has one or more interfaces 442 for communicating with external devices via the system
bus 404, using a connection 418. The memory 434 is coupled to the bus 404 using a
connection 419.
[0052]    The application program 103 includes a sequence of instructions 431 that may
include conditional branch and loop instructions. The program 103 may also include
data 432 which is used in execution of the program 103. The instructions 431 and the
data 432 are stored in memory locations 428, 429, 430 and 435, 436, 437, respectively.
Depending upon the relative size of the instructions 431 and the memory locations 428-430,
a particular instruction may be stored in a single memory location as depicted by the
instruction shown in the memory location 430. Alternately, an instruction may be segmented
into a number of parts each of which is stored in a separate memory location, as depicted by
the instruction segments shown in the memory locations 428 and 429.
[0053]    In general, the processor 405 is given a set of instructions which are executed
therein. The processor 1105 waits for a subsequent input, to which the processor 405 reacts
to by executing another set of instructions. Each input may be provided from one or more of
a number of sources, including data generated by one or more of the input devices 402, 403,
data received from an external source across one of the networks 107, 402, data retrieved
from one of the storage devices 406, 409 or data retrieved from a storage medium 425
inserted into the corresponding reader 412, all depicted in Fig. 4A. The execution of a set of
the instructions may in some cases result in output of data. Execution may also involve
storing data or variables to the memory 434.
[0054]    The disclosed DPVSC arrangements use input variables 454, which are stored in
the memory 434 in corresponding memory locations 455, 456, 457. The DPVSC
arrangements produce output variables 461, which are stored in the memory 434 in

                                                    12
corresponding memory locations 462, 463, 464. Intermediate variables 458 may be stored in
memory locations 459, 460, 466 and 467.
[0055]     Referring to the processor 405 of Fig. 4B, the registers 444, 445, 446, the arithmetic
logic unit (ALU) 440, and the control unit 439 work together to perform sequences of micro
operations needed to perform "fetch, decode, and execute" cycles for every instruction in the
instruction set making up the program 103. Each fetch, decode, and execute cycle
comprises:
         *          a fetch operation, which fetches or reads an instruction 431 from a memory
         location 428, 429, 430;
         *          a decode operation in which the control unit 439 determines which
         instruction has been fetched; and
         *          an execute operation in which the control unit 439 and/or the ALU 440
        execute the instruction.
[0056]     Thereafter, a further fetch, decode, and execute cycle for the next instruction may
be executed. Similarly, a store cycle may be performed by which the control unit 439 stores
or writes a value to a memory location 432.
[0057]     Each step or sub-process in the processes of Figs. 2 and 3 is associated with one or
more segments of the program 103 and is performed by the register section 444, 445, 447,
the ALU 440, and the control unit 439 in the processor 405 working together to perform the
fetch, decode, and execute cycles for every instruction in the instruction set for the noted
segments of the program 103.
[0058]     The DPVSC method may alternatively be implemented in dedicated hardware such
as one or more integrated circuits performing the DPVSC functions or sub functions. Such
dedicated hardware may include graphic processors, digital signal processors, or one or
more microprocessors and associated memories.
[0059]     Fig. 2 is a flow chart illustrating one example of a process 200 that can be
performed by the DPVSC server 101. The process 200 commences with a test step 201,
performed by the processor 405 executing DPVSC software 103, in order to determine

                                                 13
whether it is time to download the next respective daily fitness information file to the various
studios 109, 111 that are enrolled with the DPVSC service. If this is not the case, the process
200 follows a NO arrow 212 back to the step 201. If, on the other hand, it is time to
download the next daily fitness information, then the process 200 follows a YES arrow 215 to
a step 216.
[0060]     At the beginning of the download for each day, the step 216 contains an index
pointing to a date currently ascribed to the studio that has the earliest registration date in a
list of studios receiving the DPVSC service. Thereafter, following an arrow 202 in a step 205,
performed by the processor 405 executing DPVSC software 103, the server 101 periodically
retrieves the studio specific current information 213, indexed by the date set by the step 216,
from the multi-period fitness library 204 that is stored on the server database 105. The
server 101 may also communicate the date set by the step 216 to a person (not shown) who
connects the one or more portable memory modules 1312 to the server 101 in order to
download the studio specific current information 213, indexed by the date set by the step
216. Thereafter, following an arrow 206, the server 101 sends the current fitness information
213 to all studios that enrolled with the DPVSC service on the same date, as recorded by the
studio information 129. Alternately, the one or more portable memory modules 1312, having
stored the studio specific current information 213, indexed by the date set by the step 216,
are physically transported to at least some of the studios that enrolled with the DPVSC
service on the same date and the one or more portable memory modules 1312 are
connected to the respective studio computers 114 in order to download the studio specific
current information 213, indexed by the date set by the step 216, to those studio computers
114. Thereafter, following an arrow 208, a test step 209 determines if there are further
studios that have not yet received their daily download. If this is the case, then the process
200 follows a YES arrow 210 back to the step 216 which increments to the next date upon
which a studio registered with the DPVSC service. If, on the other hand, there are no more
studios to receive the daily download, then the process 200 follows a NO arrow 211 back to
the test step 201. Furthermore, the index associated with the step 216 is set to the same
date used on the current day plus one day.
[0061]     Figs. 1OA and 1OB respectively depict examples of the multi-period fitness library
104 and a current studio program 213 extracted from the multi-period fitness library.
[0062]     Fig. 1OA shows that the multi-period fitness library 104 is made up of a succession
of studio information program files 1007, 1008, 1009, 1010...,1011,.... Each item of studio

                                                 14
information, such as 1007, is also associated with a particular date 1014. In the case of the
studio information 1007, the date associated with that item is 17 January 2014. Successive
items in the multi-period fitness library are associated with successive dates. The multi
period fitness library is, in one DPVSC example, constructed out over a 2 to 3 year period.
The multi-period fitness library 104 is typically continuously added to so that new exercise
routines are added to the library 104 in an ongoing manner.
[0063]    When a studio first registers with the DPVSC service, the first daily download of
current studio information 213 that the studio receives is dictated by the date of registration.
Thus, for example, if the studio 109 enrolled with the DPVSC service on 18 January 2014,
then the first daily download of current studio information 213 is the studio information 1008,
as depicted by a dashed arrow 1012. In contrast, if the studio 111 registered with the
DPVSC service on 20 January 2014, then the first daily download of current studio
information 213 which the studio 111 receives is the studio information 1010, as depicted by
a dashed arrow 1013. In this manner, studios which enrol with the DPVSC service on
different dates commence at a different point in the multi-period fitness library 104.
Alternately, all studios in the DPVSC arrangement can receive identical downloads of current
studio information 213. This can arise for promotional purposes for example. Alternately, the
current studio information 213 for each studio can be retrieved by the server in the step 205
from the library 104 in any other order as may be desired.
[0064]     Fig. 1OB shows current studio information 213, and it is evident that the information
213 is made up of exercise parameters associated with a number of different information
segments. One segment 1001 described hereinafter in more detail in regard to Fig. 8,
contains the name of a current workout. Another segment 1002, described hereinafter in
more detail in regard to Figs. 8, 5A, 5B, 6A, 6B, 7A and 7B contains the locations of the
exercise stations within the studio for the day in question, as well as equipment associated
with each station. Another segment 1003 contains one or more music playlists for the studio
for the day in question. Another information segment 1004, described hereinafter in more
detail in regard to Fig. 12, contains timer parameters for each station in the studio. Another
information segment 1005, described hereinafter in more detail with reference to Fig. 12,
contains one or more video files for each exercise station. An information segment 1006,
described hereinafter in more detail with regard to Fig. 8, contains a list of exercises for each
exercise station.

                                                   15
[0065]    Fig. 3 is a flow chart illustrating an example of a process 300 performed by a studio
computer such as 114 in a DPVSC arrangement. The process 300 commences with a step
301, performed by a processor (not shown) in the computer 114, as directed by a software
application (not shown) running on the computer 114, in which the studio computer 114
determines if it is time to receive a new daily download from the server 101. If this is not the
case, then the process 300 follows an NO arrow 314 back to the step 301. If, on the other
hand, it is time to receive a new download, then the process 300 follows a YES arrow 302 to
a step 303 as depicted by an arrow 302. In the step 303, performed by a processor (not
shown) in the computer 114, as directed by a software application (not shown) running on
the computer 114, the studio computer 104 periodically receives as depicted by a dashed
arrow 304, the new daily studio information 213. This periodic receipt of the new daily studio
information 213 can be performed by direct download of the information from the server 101
over the network 107. Alternately, the periodic receipt of the new daily studio information 213
can be performed by download from the one or more portable memory modules 1312 that
are periodically connected to the studio computer 104. A hybrid download arrangement is
also possible, whereby some downloads of the studio information from the database 104 is
received by direct download from the server 101 over the network 107, and other downloads
of the studio information from the database 104 is received via the one or more portable
memory modules 1312. Control then follows an arrow 305 to a decision step 306 in which the
operator of the studio 111 (not shown) decides whether or not to edit the current studio
information 213 that has been downloaded by the server 101. If editing is desired, then
control follows a YES arrow 115 to a step 316 in which the studio operator edits the
downloaded information 213 using user interface modules at the studio computer 114.
Control then follows an arrow 317 to a step 308. Returning to the decision step 306, if the
received current studio information 213 does not require editing, then control follows an NO
arrow 307 to the step 308.
[0066]    In the step 308 studio staff configure the studio exercise stations 128, 129 ...
throughout the studio in question in accordance with the current studio information 213 or the
edited version thereof.
[0067]    The configuration of the studio stations arranged in accordance with the step 308
has a number of different aspects. Once of these, described hereinafter in more detail with
respect to Figs. 5A, 5B, 6A, 6B, 7A and 7B relate to physically locating the exercise stations
around the studio in question in a particular physical layout. Another aspect relates to

                                                 16
equipment which may be associated with each station, described hereinafter in more detail in
regard to Figs. 8 and 9.
[0068]    Returning to Fig. 3, the process 300 then follows an arrow 309 to a step 310. In the
step 310, performed by a processor (not shown) in the computer 114, as directed by a
software application (not shown) running on the computer 114, the studio computer 114
distributes station information, derived from the downloaded current studio information 213 or
the edited version thereof, to the displays 117, 119 ....
[0069]    The studio is now ready for users thereof to commence their exercise routines, and
the process 300 follows an arrow 311 to a decision step 312. In the step 312, performed by
a processor (not shown) in the computer 114, as directed by a software application (not
shown) running on the computer 114, the studio computer 114 determines if the current
exercise daily period has expired. The studio will continue operating until the step 312
determines that the end of the day has arrived. If the end of the day has not yet arrived, then
the process 300 follows an NO arrow 318 back to the step 310. In this manner, the current
studio information is presented, on a per-exercise station basis, throughout the day. If, on
the other hand, the step 312 determines that the daily exercise period has expired, then the
process 300 follows a YES arrow 313 back to the step 301. At this point, the information
being presented at the various exercise stations is shut down.
[0070]    Fig. 12 illustrates an example 1200 of a display screen 1204 associated with an
exercise station in the studio 111 according to a DPVSC arrangement. In the example
shown, the station associated with the display 1204 is station No. 4. In Fig. 12 the display
1204 is actually a display window 1202 in a larger display 1201.
[0071]    Once the step 310 in the process 300 (see Fig. 3) commences distribution of station
directions to the various displays, a user at the station No. 4 sees a video presentation 1209
on the display 1204. The video presentation 1209 demonstrates a particular exercise that the
user of station No. 4 is to perform at the station in question. In the illustration 1200 a person
1208, shown in stick figure form, is performing chin-ups using the horizontal bar 1207.
Presentation of information 1205 at an upper right hand corner of the display 1204 indicates
that the "work time" during which the user is to perform the chin-ups is a 40 second period.
Subsequently, the user is to observe a rest time of 20 seconds. The user is to perform one
set of chin-ups according to the aforementioned work/rest times per "set", and is to perform
12 rounds in total. This means, in one example, that the user is to perform chin-ups for 40

                                                17
seconds and then rest for 20 seconds, after which, in accordance with an instruction 1206,
the user is to go to station No. 7 and follow the instructions on the associated display at that
station. At some point, the user will be directed back to the present station No. 4, at which
time the user will repeat the chin-ups for the work time of 40 seconds and the rest time of 20
seconds. The user will repeat this repetition 12 times during the present exercise session.
[0072]    Fig. 11 is a flow chart showing one example of a process 1100 used by a user of the
DPVSC arrangement. The process 1100 commences with a start step 1101 and control then
follows an arrow 1102 to a step 1103 in which the user goes to a first station in the studio.
The user can either pick a random station to which to go for this initial exercise session, or
can be directed there by a personal trainer. Control then follows an arrow 1104 to a step
1105 in which the user performs the displayed exercise for "work time" seconds in
accordance with station directions 319 (also referred to as exercise routines) that are
presented on the display 1204 (see Fig. 12). Control then follows an arrow 1106 to a
process 1107 in which the user rests for "rest time" seconds in accordance with the
directions 1205 on the display 1204. The aforementioned performance of the exercise and
the rest period associated therewith constitute, as depicted by a dashed arrow 1118, an
exercise routine 1117 that the user performs at the station in question.
[0073]    After performing the exercise and rest periods indicated by the station directions
319, the process 1100 follows an arrow 1108 to a step 1109 which determines whether
sets/rounds are to be performed at the present station. This is typically determined by the
station directions 1205 presented on the display 1204. If further sets/rounds at the present
station are to be performed, then control follows a YES arrow 1114 back to the step 1105. If,
on the other hand, there are no further sets/rounds to be performed at the present station,
then control follows a NO arrow 1110 to a step 1111. The step 1111 determines whether
there are further stations for the user to use during the present exercise session. If this is the
case, then control follows a YES arrow 1115 which directs control back to the step 1103 in
which the user goes to the next station, as indicated by the direction 1206 in Fig. 12. If, on

Fig. 3. In this regard, the studio computer 114 can, in one DPVSC implementation,
continuously steam information to the studio displays such as 117 on a continuous basis
throughout the day. Alternatively, each display 117 can have a local processor and memory
(not shown) to which station directions for the current day can be downloaded once only.
Thereafter, the local processor and memory can present the downloaded information at the
display 117 as required.
[0085]     The studio also comprises the station display modules 1307 which in one DPVSC
arrangement comprise only the displays such as 117. In an alternate DPVSC arrangement,
the station display modules can also incorporate, together with the displays such as 117,
