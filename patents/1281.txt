CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION
[0001]          This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application
61/718,981, filed October 26, 2012, which is incorporated herein by reference.
FIELD OF THE INVENTION
[0002]          The present invention relates generally to invasive probes, and specifically
to a probe with a deformable distal end.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
[0003]          Various therapeutic procedures such as cardiac ablation use an invasive
medical probe such as a catheter that is inserted into a patient's body. During an ablation
procedure on a heart, there may be local overheating of the heart surface being ablated, as
well as of the heart tissue underlying the surface. The surface overheating may be
manifested as charring, and the overheating of the underlying tissue may cause other
damage to the tissue, even leading to penetration of the tissue. To control the temperature
of the surface and the underlying tissue, the region being ablated may be irrigated with an
irrigation fluid, typically saline, in order to prevent charring.
[0004]          In addition to the risk of charring, overheating of blood in the region being
ablated may cause the formation of potentially dangerous blood clots, which can grow and
potentially cause a heart attack or a stroke. While the irrigation may slightly reduce blood
clot formation by cooling and diluting the blood, there is still a possibility of clotting.
[0005]          A number of catheters with flexible tips have been described in the patent
literature. For example, U.S. Patent 5,720,719, whose disclosure is incorporated herein by
reference, describes a catheter having a probe end that includes a malleable tube and a
flexible tube. These elements are said to allow the probe end to conform to the curvature
of the cavity inside a patient's body.

be considered an integral part of the application except that to the extent any terms are
defined in these incorporated documents in a manner that conflicts with the definitions
made explicitly or implicitly in the present specification, only the definitions in the present
specification should be considered.
[0007]           The description above is presented as a general overview of related art in
this field and should not be construed as an admission that any of the information it
contains constitutes prior art against the present patent application.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

invention a medical probe, including a flexible insertion tube having a deformable distal
end for insertion into a body cavity of a patient, the deformable distal end including a
flexible and porous material configured to be brought into contact with tissue in the body
cavity. The medical probe also includes a means for inflating the deformable distal end,
and a channel contained within the insertion tube and configured to convey a fluid that
irrigates the tissue through pores of the deformable distal end. The medical probe further
includes an electrical conductor passing through the flexible insertion tube, terminating in
the deformable distal end and configured to convey radio frequency (RF) energy to the
tissue via the deformable distal end.
[0009]           In some embodiments, the flexible and porous material may include a
conductive material, the electrical conductor can be coupled to the flexible and porous
material so as to convey the RF energy to the deformable distal end, and the RF energy can
be conveyed to the tissue by the deformable distal end conveying the RF energy to the
tissue.
[0010]           In embodiments where the flexible and porous material may include a
conductive material, the conductive material may include a fabric woven from strands of
Nitinol. In additional embodiments where the flexible and porous material may include a
conductive material, the conductive material can be configured to transfer a current, and

                                               3
the medical probe may further include a processor configured to determine a position of
the distal end in response to an impedance to the current.
[0011]          In further embodiments, the fluid may include a saline solution. In
embodiments where the fluid includes a saline solution, the electrical conductor can
convey the RF energy to the tissue by conveying the RF energy to the saline solution, and
the saline solution conveying the RF energy to the tissue.
[0012]          In some embodiments, the medical probe may include an intracardiac
catheter, and the body cavity may include a chamber of a heart. In additional

body cavity. In further embodiments, the insertion tube has a first diameter, and upon
inflation of the deformable distal end, the deformable distal end has a second diameter
greater than the first diameter. In supplementary embodiments, a contact area between the
deformable distal end and the tissue can increase upon pressing the deformable distal end
against the tissue.
[0013]          In some embodiments, the means for inflating the deformable distal end
may include conveying the fluid so as to generate a mechanical force sufficient to inflate
the deformable distal end. In an alternative embodiment, the means for inflating the
deformable distal end may include a wire frame protruding from a distal tip of the flexible
insertion tube and covered by the deformable distal end, and a control wire, passing
through the flexible insertion tube, coupled to the wire frame and configured to resize the
wire frame. In the alternative embodiment including the wire frame, the electrical
conductor terminates in the wire frame, and the wire frame is configured to convey the RF
energy from the electrical conductor to the deformable distal end.

contained within the flexible insertion tube so as to irrigate the tissue through pores of the

                                                4
deformable distal end. The method further includes conveying radio frequency (RF)
energy to the tissue via the deformable distal end.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS
OVERVIEW
[0024]          Catheters used in invasive cardiac procedures, such as intracardiac ablation
for treatment of arrhythmias, typically have a rigid tip. When the tip is brought into
contact with myocardial tissue at the proper angle and with sufficient force, the tissue
conforms to the tip, affording good mechanical and electrical contact. The area of contact
is typically limited by the tip size, however, and may be even smaller, depending on the
angle of contact and other parameters.
[0025]          Embodiments of the present invention provide an irrigated ablation catheter
that has a deformable head. The deformable head increases the surface area that physically
interfaces with the tissue and may also be useful in ensuring that the contact pressure
between the catheter head and the tissue is roughly constant over the entire area of contact.
[0026]          The catheter head can be fabricated from a porous cloth-like material, which
may itself be flexible and/or conductive. In some embodiments, during an ablation
procedure using the catheter, fluid, such as saline solution, can be forced through the
porous material, so as to irrigate the area being ablated, as well as to irrigate the cloth-like
material. (Irrigating the material ensures the integrity of the material, by keeping the
material cool.) The fluid provides a means for delivering sufficient mechanical force to
inflate the head, and to keep the head inflated during the procedure. Because the same
saline solution can be for both irrigation and inflation, a separate inflating system is not
required.
[0027]          In alternative embodiments, the cloth-like material may cover an
expandable wire frame that protrudes from a distal end of the catheter, and the size of the
wire frame can be managed via a control wire coupled to the frame. For example, an
operator (e.g., a cardiologist) can expand the wire frame which provides a means to

                                                6
"inflate" the head by "pushing" the control wire toward the distal end. Likewise, the
operator can contract the wire frame (and thereby "deflate" the head) by "pulling" the
control wire away from the distal end. While embodiments herein describe a catheter head
that can be resized via fluid pressure or a resizable wire frame, other methods of expanding
and contracting the catheter head are considered to be within the spirit and scope of the
present invention.
[0028]          Once in contact with the tissue, the catheter head conforms to the tissue, due
to a mechanical response from the tissue and the flexibility of the head. The conformation
with the tissue provides a larger interface surface compared with a rigid catheter tip.
[0029]          During insertion, the catheter head need not be inflated and a sheath of the
catheter can thus have a small diameter. After inflation the catheter head may be of a
larger diameter than the sheath, providing a larger surface for ablation. Using this
approach, a smaller-diameter ablation catheter can be used to treat ablation areas that
would otherwise require a larger-diameter catheter for treatment. Having a larger ablation
surface can support deeper ablation, such as for use in the left ventricle, or for use in
forming scar tissue where a specific target location may not be known.
[0030]          Although the disclosed embodiments relate specifically to intracardiac
ablation, the principles of this invention may similarly be applied in other therapeutic and
diagnostic procedures, both in the heart and in other organs.
SYSTEM DESCRIPTION
[0031]          Figure 1 is a schematic, pictorial illustration of a medical system 20
configured to perform an ablation procedure, in accordance with an embodiment of the
present invention. System 20 comprises a probe 22, in the present example an intracardiac
catheter comprising a flexible insertion tube 24, and a control console 26. Probe 22 is
typically connected by a suitable connector at its proximal end to console 26.
[0032]          In the embodiment described hereinbelow, it is assumed that probe 22 is
used for diagnostic or therapeutic treatment, such as mapping electrical potentials of a
heart 28, or performing ablation of endocardial tissue of the heart. Alternatively, probe 22

                                               7
may be used, mutatis mutandis, for other therapeutic and/or diagnostic purposes in the
heart or in other body organs.
[0033]          An operator 30, such as a cardiologist, inserts probe 22 through the vascular
system of a patient 32 so that a distal end 34 of probe 22 enters a chamber of the patient's
heart 28 (e.g., the left atrium). Operator 30 advances probe 22 so that a distal tip 36 of the
probe engages body tissue at desired locations. As described in Figures 2A-3C
hereinbelow, distal tip 36 comprises a deformable head 62, also referred to herein as a
deformable distal end, comprising a flexible and porous material that may be conductive.
In some embodiments deformable head 62 is conductive and can function as a position
sensor, as described hereinbelow. In additional configurations, deformable head 62 is
configured to convey radio frequency (RF) energy to intracardiac tissue of heart 28 during
an ablation procedure.
[0034]          In the example of Figure 1, console 26 is connected, via a cable 38, to body
surface electrodes, which typically comprise adhesive skin patches 40 that are affixed to
patient 32. Console 26 determines position coordinates of probe 22 inside heart 28 based
on the impedance measured between the deformable head, when it is conductive, and
patches 40. Although system 20 uses impedance-based sensing to measure a location of
deformable head 62, other position tracking techniques may be used (e.g., magnetic-based
sensors). Magnetic position tracking techniques are described, for example, in U.S.
Patents 5,391,199, 5,443,489, 6,788,967, 6,690,963, 5,558,091, 6,172,499 6,177,792,
whose disclosures are incorporated herein by reference. Impedance-based position
tracking techniques are described, for example, in U.S. Patents 5,983,126, 6,456,864 and
5,944,022, whose disclosures are incorporated herein by reference.
[0035]          Console 26 comprises a processor 42, which typically comprises a general
purpose computer, with suitable front end and interface circuits for receiving signals from
probe 22 and controlling the other components of console 26. An input/output (1/0)
communications interface 44 enables console 26 to interact with probe 22 and patches 40.
Based on the signals received from probe 22 and from patches 40, processor 42 produces
and displays a map 46 showing the position of distal tip 36 in the patient's body, the
distance and/or contact indication between the loop and the body tissue, as well as status

                                               8
information and guidance regarding the procedure that is in progress. Map 46 is presented
to operator 30 using a display 48. The position of probe 22 may be superimposed on map
46 or on another image of heart 28.
[0036]          Processor 42 typically comprises a general-purpose computer, with suitable
front end and interface circuits for receiving signals from probe 22 and controlling the
other components of console 26. Processor 42 may be programmed in software to carry
out the functions that are described herein. The software may be downloaded to console
26 in electronic form, over a network, for example, or it may be provided on non-transitory
tangible media, such as optical, magnetic or electronic memory media. Alternatively,
some or all of the functions of processor 42 may be carried out by dedicated or
programmable digital hardware components.
[0037]          Console 26 also comprises an irrigation module 50 and an RF ablation
module 52. Processor 42 uses the ablation module to monitor and control ablation
parameters such as the level of ablation power applied via deformable head 62. The
ablation module may also monitor and control the duration of the ablation that is provided.
[0038]          Typically, during ablation, heat is generated in the electrode (or electrodes)
providing the ablation, as well as in the surrounding region. In order to dissipate the heat
and to improve the efficiency of the ablation process, system 20 supplies an irrigation fluid
to distal end 34 via a channel (described hereinbelow). System 20 uses irrigation module
50 to monitor and control irrigation parameters, such as the pressure, flow rate, and
temperature of the irrigation fluid.
CATHETER WITH A DEFORMABLE HEAD
[0039]          Figure 2A schematically illustrates distal end 34 of probe 22, Figures 2B
and 2C are pictorial illustrations of a woven fabric used to construct deformable head 62,
and Figure 2D is a schematic pictorial illustration of deformable head 62 in contact with
endocardial tissue 70 of heart 28, in accordance with a first embodiment of the present
invention.

                                                9
[0040]          Distal end 34 is covered by a flexible, insulating sheath 60 having a distal
tip 68, and deformable head 62 is fixed to the distal end. In operation, deformable head 62
can be inflated and irrigated by a saline solution, which irrigation module 50 pumps
through a channel 64, typically a tube, within sheath 60. An electrical conductor 66 passes
within the catheter sheath to terminate at the deformable head and to convey radio
frequency (RF) electrical energy to deformable head 62.
[0041]          Deformable head 62 may be made out of any suitable porous, flexible
material. For some applications, a resilient, woven fabric may be advantageous. For
enhanced mechanical strength and resilience, in one embodiment of the present invention,
the fabric may be woven at least partially from elastic metal fibers, such as strands of
Nitinol. This sort of implementation is illustrated in Figures 2B and 2C, which
respectively show side and end views of deformable head 62. As described hereinbelow,
the use of a metal-based fabric is also helpful in conducting electrical energy to the
intracardiac tissue.
[0042]          In the example shown in Figure 2D, irrigation module 50 conveys a saline
solution 72 (or any other type of irrigation fluid) through channel 64, thereby generating a
mechanical force sufficient to inflate deformable head 62 and to irrigate the tissue via
pores 69 (Fig. 2C) in the porous and flexible material used to fabricate the deformable
head. While deformable head 62 is inflated and pressed against endocardial tissue 70, the
deformable head conforms to the endocardial tissue, as shown in the Figure.
[0043]          In some embodiments, upon initially engaging endocardial tissue 70,
deformable head 62 has an initial contact area 74 that comprises a portion of the flexible
material that is in contact with the endocardial tissue. As deformable head 62 presses
against endocardial tissue 70, contact area 74 can increase (up to a maximum contact area)
as the deformable head deforms by spreading out.
[0044]          As described supra, during insertion of tube 24, the deformable head need
not be inflated. Therefore, sheath 60 may have a sheath diameter, and upon being inflated,
deformable head 62 may have a head diameter that is greater than the sheath diameter.

                                               10
Typically, deformable head 62 has a shape that forms a seal between the deformable head
and sheath 60. In some embodiments, deformable head 62 has a "balloon"-like shape.
[0045]          When deformable head 62 is conductive, e.g., comprises suitable metal
strands or a conductive polymer, ablation module 52 can convey RF energy to the
deformable head via electrical conductor 66, and the deformable head conducts the energy
to the tissue. Alternatively or additionally, electrical conductor 66 may apply the RF
energy to saline solution 72, in which case the saline solution may conduct the RF energy
through deformable head 62 to the endocardial tissue.
[0046]          Figure 3A schematically illustrates distal end 34 of probe 22 comprising a
wire frame 80, Figure 3B is a schematic pictorial illustration of the wire frame, and Figure
3C is a schematic pictorial illustration of deformable head 62 in contact with endocardial
tissue 70 of heart 28, in accordance with a second embodiment of the present invention. In
Figures 3A and 3B, wire frame 80 is "mushroom"-shaped, coupled to electrical conductor
66, and affixed to a distal end of channel 64. In Figure 3C, a wire frame 82 is cylindrical,
is coupled to electrical conductor 66, and is affixed to a distal end of sheath 60.
[0047]          In embodiments of the present invention, deformable distal end 62 can be
expanded and contracted by resizing wire frame 80. In the configuration shown in Figure
3A, the diameter of the mushroom-shaped wire frame can be resized via a control wire 84
that passes within the catheter sheath and is coupled to outer edges 86 of the wire frame.
For example, if the mushroom-shaped wire frame is flexible, and operator 30 pulls on
control wire 84, then the control wire can contract wire frame 80 by retracting outer edges
86 toward a longitudinal axis 88 of sheath 60. Likewise, if operator 30 pushes on control
wire 84, the control wire can expand wire frame 80 by protracting outer edges 86 away
from the longitudinal axis of the sheath.
[0048]          While the examples in Figures 3A-3C show the wire frames in mushroom
and cylindrical shapes, other shapes are considered to be within the spirit and scope of the
present invention. Additionally, while the description hereinbelow describes configuration
and operation of wire frame 80, wire frame 82 can be configured and operated in the same
manner.

                                              11
[0049]          In this second embodiment of the present invention, probe 22 comprises
wire frame 80 that protrudes from sheath 60 and is covered by deformable distal head 62.
Wires of frame 80 are flexible but resilient enough so that the frame maintains its overall
form under deformation, as shown in Figure 3C. Wire frame 80 thus provides some
mechanical stability to deformable head 62, allowing a more flexible fabric to be used for
the deformable head.
[0050]          As shown in Figure 3A, wire frame 80 extends from distal sheath tip 68 of
sheath 60 and is contained within deformable head 62. Conductor 66 runs through sheath
60 and is coupled to wire frame 80. During an ablation procedure, conductor 66 conveys
RF energy from ablation module 52 to wire frame 80, and the wire frame conveys the RF
energy to endocardial tissue 70 when the wire frame presses against deformable head 62
and the deformable head is in contact with the endocardial tissue, as shown in Figure 3C.
In an alternative embodiment, wire frame 80 can convey the RF energy to saline solution
72 (i.e., within deformable head 62) without the frame contacting head 62. In this case the
saline solution may convey at least a portion of the RF energy to tissue 70.
[0051]          Figures 4A-4C show heat maps 90A-90C that illustrate one of the benefits
of the deformable catheter head in terms of forming deeper and wider ablation lesions, by
increasing an area of contact between the catheter head and the tissue (i.e., as deformable
head 62 presses against endocardial tissue 70, as shown in Figures 2D and 3C). Figures
4A-4C show heat maps 90 (i.e., a heat map 90A in Figure 4A, a heat map 90B in Figure
4B and a heat map 90C in Figure 4C) that indicate how energy (i.e., heat) diffuses into
endocardial tissue 70 during an ablation procedure using probe 22.
[0052]          In the heat maps, a Y-axis 96 indicates a depth of endocardial tissue 70
relative to deformable head 62, and an X-axis 98 indicates a transverse displacement from
deformable head 62 as the deformable head presses against the endocardial tissue. In Y
axis 96, a zero value indicates that deformable head 62 is in contact with endocardial tissue
70 while causing a depression, of approximately 1 mm, in the tissue.
[0053]          The heat maps convey, using different visual patterns, indicated in a legend
102, a calculated tissue temperature during ablation as a function of depth (i.e., Y-axis 96)

                                                 12
and transverse displacement (i.e., X-axis 98) relative to a center of the distal tip, which is
located at the origin (0,0) at the left side of each figure. As shown in this visual
representation, the hottest temperatures are measured at the left side of each figure below
the catheter tip, and the coolest temperatures are measured at areas distant from the
catheter tip, with intermediate temperatures measured in regions between the hottest and
the coolest temperatures.
[0054]          While for purposes of simplicity, the heat maps show regions 92 with
uniform temperatures, in practice the temperature changes are typically gradual between
isothermal lines 94, where each line style references a specific temperature, as indicated in
a legend 100.
[0055]          In some embodiments of the present invention, the contact area between
distal tip 36 and endocardial tissue 70 can be controlled and increased as appropriate by
suitably inflating and deforming the deformable head against the tissue. In the examples
shown in Figures 4A-4C, the diameter of the contact area is increased from about 3 mm in
Figure 4A, to about 5 mm in Figure 4B, to about 10 mm in Figure 4C. Additionally, the
voltage on the catheter is increased from 25 V in Figure 4A, to 30 V in Figure 4B, to 35 V
in Figure 4C, in order to keep the current density constant, and thus to maintain a constant
temperature at the hottest spot in the tissue below the catheter. As shown in the heat maps,
the width of the resulting lesions increases linearly with the distal tip contact area, while
the depth increases, as well, though less markedly.
