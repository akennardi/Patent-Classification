                                          ABSTRACT
          The present invention relates to a water-dilutable        antimicrobial composition
comprising a first acid being one or several C6-C12 fatty acid(s) and a second acid being a
mixture of propionic acid and lactic acid, wherein the said composition comprises at least
0.1% of the said first acid (weight first acid : weight composition), wherein the weight ratio
between the said second acid and the said first acid is of at least 8 (weight second acid :
weight first acid) and wherein the pH of the said composition is less than 5.0. The application
also relates to a method and the use of the water-dilutable antimicrobial composition for
sanitizing a surface.

                                  Antimicrobial composition
   Background of the invention
   [0001]                The present invention relates to a new disinfectant composition,
10 especially adapted for cleaning plant equipment in food industry, and in particular in
   brewery industry, as well as to a method for sanitizing a solid support surface by the
   use of this composition.
   State of the Art
   [0002]                For ensuring both product quality and health security of the
15 consumer, it is a required practise in food and beverage industries to regularly submit
   the equipment to a strict cleaning so as to remove all residuals and contaminants
   (organic matters, fats, proteins,...) susceptible to lead to a detrimental development of
   microorganisms (bacteria and yeasts); it is also required to reduce microbial population
   on the equipment to very low levels; e.g. to safe levels as established by public
20 regulations.
   [0003]                The main difficulty in cleaning surfaces in food and beverage
   industries such as pipes and tanks, lies on the fact that the equipment is mostly not
   disassembled before cleaning and that cleaning has thus to be performed in place.
   [0004]                Cleaning in place (CIP) of such surfaces usually consists in
25 applying on these solid supports, at the end of a processing cycle, a first composition
   especially dedicated to the cleaning of the surfaces as such, rinsing with water the
   surfaces, then applying on these rinsed surfaces a second composition dedicated to
   their antimicrobial treatment. Finally, the surfaces are rinsed once again with water
   before starting the next processing cycle. The cleaning process is usually performed at
30 a temperature of about 10 C for a relatively long period of more than 1 hour (generally
   from about 1 to about 2 hours), independently from the rinsing time. At the end of the
   total cleaning in place process, a population reduction of at least 99.999% (a five-log
   reduction) of undesired microorganisms is reached.
   [0005]                Different compositions using different components having among
35 others detergent properties have already been proposed. For example, it has been
   proposed in WO 94/10837 to use solutions comprising an aliphatic C6-C15 fatty acid

                                                 2
   such as nonanoic acid and/or decanoic acid, a strong acid such as sulfuric acid, and
   minor amounts of a weak acid such as propionic acid, butyric acid or valeric acid.
   [0006]               EP 1 003 371         B1 discloses a bactericidal and yeast-killing
   disinfecting composition comprising a monocarboxylic acid with a saturated or
 5 unsaturated, straight or branched-chain alkyl radical comprising from 6 to 12 carbon
   atoms or a mixture of such carboxylic acids, a strong inorganic acid such as sulphuric
   acid, an organic acid such as acetic acid and/or glycolic acid, one or more anionic
   surfactants such as a surface-active sulfonate or a surface-active ether carboxylic acid,
   and a solubilizing agent such as butyl glycol or butyl diglycol.
10 [0007]               US     2010/297316      discloses   an     antimicrobial composition
   comprising a mixture of octanoic acid and lactic acid.
   [0008]               WO      2013/059012      discloses   an    antimicrobial composition
   comprising a mixture of nonanoic acid and propionic acid.
   [0009]               WO 03/044145 discloses an antimicrobial composition comprising
15 a C5-C14 fatty acid (preferably nonanoic acid and/or decanoic acid) combined with a
   strong acid (like phosphoric acid or nitric acid) and acetic acid.
   [0010]               WO      2011/017367      discloses   an    antimicrobial composition
   comprising nonanoic acid and propionic acid.
   [0011]               WO 83/00163 discloses an antimicrobial composition comprising a
20 C6-C14  fatty acid.
   [0012]               US 7,943,565 discloses an acidic sanitizing and/or cleaning
   composition capable of being diluted and comprising at least one C1-C4 hydroxy alkyl
   carboxylic acid or salt thereof, and namely an alpha (or beta) hydroxyl alkyl carboxylic
   acid such as lactic acid, at least one C5-C18 alkyl monocarboxylic acid or salt thereof,
25 such as octanoic acid, at least one dicarboxylic acid such as tartaric acid, at least one
   acid such as sulphuric acid, at least one solubilizer selected for example from alkyl
   sulfonates and alkylaryl sulfonates, at least one diluent and optionally at least one
   detergent.
   [0013]               Nowadays, there is a real industrial pressure for providing more
30 and more performing compositions in terms of cleaning and sanitizing properties, which
   should be also less corrosive, more environmentally friendly, and less time consuming.
   [0014]               Nevertheless, the man skilled in the art aiming at providing a
   satisfying composition has to solve together different and complex technical problems.
   [0015]               The composition should be homogenous, stable and adapted for
35 storage, for instance storage at room temperature. The composition should also be
   homogenous, stable and adapted for usage at low temperatures.

                                                 3
   [0016]               The composition should be water-dilutable; hence concentrated
   enough so as to reduce logistic constraints, which means that the concentrated
   composition must also be stable and not undergo phase separation at low or at room
   temperature. Such concentrated composition should also be easy to dilute in water.
 5 [0017]               The antimicrobial action of the composition should be such that it
   can reduce the population of microorganisms by five logs at 3'C in less than 20
   minutes.
   [0018]                Moreover, the composition has to be efficient on a wide range of
   microorganisms, that is not only on both gram (+) and gram (-) bacteria, but also on
10 yeasts such as Saccharomyces and Candida.
   [0019]                In addition, the composition has to foam as less as possible, as
   foaming may lead to an adsorption on surfaces and thereby interfere with the rinsing
   efficiency. Foaming may also cause damages to the equipment.
   [0020]               The composition should also be easy to recycle for a next use.
15 [0021]                Finally, it is advantageous that the concentration of the solution be
   followed and determined continuously by electrical conductivity measurements.
   Summary of the invention
   [0022]               The present invention relates to a water-dilutable antimicrobial
   composition comprising: a first acid being one or several C6-C12 fatty acid(s) and a
20 second acid being a mixture of propionic acid and lactic acid, wherein the said
   composition comprises at least 0.1% (preferably at least 1 %, more preferably at least
   5% and possibly up to 10%) of this first acid (weight first acid:weight composition),
   wherein the weight ratio between this second acid and this first acid is of at least 5
   (preferably of at least 8) (weight second acid:weight first acid) and wherein the pH of
25 this composition is less than 5.0.
   [0023]                Preferably, more than 10 wt % or more than 20 wt % of propionic
   acid is present in this water-dilutable composition (weight propionic acid: weight
   composition) of the invention.
   [0024]                Preferably the second acid of this water-dilutable composition
30 comprises both lactic acid and propionic acid in a weight ratio comprised between
   (about) 0.1 and (about) 10 (weight lactic acid:weight propionic acid), still more
   preferably between (about) 1 and (about) 5 or even more preferably between (about)
   2.0 (or about 2.5) and (about) 4 (or 3.0).
   [0025]                Preferably the first acid of this water dilutable composition is
35 selected from the group consisting of hexanoic acid, heptanoic acid, octanoic acid,

                                                  4
   nonanoic acid, decanoic acid, undecanoic acid, undecyclenic acid, lauric acid, and
   mixtures thereof, more preferably octanoic acid and/or undecyclenic acid.
   [0026]                Advantageously, this water-dilutable composition further comprises
   a third acid, preferably selected from the group consisting of nitric acid, phosphoric
 5 acid, sulphuric acid, chloric acid (i.e. strong mineral acids), acetic acid, citric acid,
   tartaric acid (and/or other dicarboxylic acids such as fumaric acid, malonic acid, oxalic
   acid, malic acid and succinic acid), and mixture thereof (preferably sulphuric acid,
   possibly in addition to another third acid such as citric acid and/or acetic acid and/or a
   dicarboxylic acid).
10 [0027]                 Preferably, the first acid, the second acid and possibly the third
   acid are present in this water-dilutable composition in a weight ratio comprised
   between 50% and 99% (weight of the sum of all these first, second and possibly third
   acids: weight of the said composition), more preferably between about 75% and about
   90%, still more preferably between about 80% and about 85%.
15 [0028]                 Preferably, more than 1%, more preferably more than 5% of the
   first acid (i.e. one or several C6-C12 fatty acid(s); preferably hexanoic acid, heptanoic
   acid, octanoic acid, nonanoic acid, decanoic acid, undecanoic acid, undecyclenic acid,
   lauric acid, and mixtures thereof, preferably octanoic acid and/or undecyclenic acid) is
   present in this water-dilutable composition (weight first fatty acid:weight composition).
20 [0029]                Advantageously, this water-dilutable composition is detergent-free.
   [0030]                A closely related aspect of the present invention is thus a water
   dilutable antimicrobial composition comprising at least 0.1 wt % (preferably between
   (about) 1 wt % and (about) 10 wt %, more preferably between (about) 2 wt % and
   (about) 5.5 wt % or between (about) 3 wt % and (about) 5 wt %) of a C6-C12 fatty acid
25 (weight fatty acid:weight composition) and being detergent-free, preferably this C6-C12
   fatty acid is selected from the group consisting of hexanoic acid, heptanoic acid,
   octanoic acid, nonanoic acid, decanoic acid, undecanoic acid, undecyclenic acid, lauric
   acid, and mixtures thereof, more preferably octanoic acid and/or undecyclenic acid.
   [0031]                Another related aspect of the present invention is an antimicrobial
30 composition (a water-diluted antimicrobial composition) comprising this water-dilutable
   composition.
   [0032]                 Still another related aspect of the present invention is the use of
   the water-dilutable composition of the present invention for sanitizing a (hard) surface
   (of a solid support, such as glass, and in particular a glass bottle), or a method of
35 sanitizing a (hard) surface (of a solid support,such as glass, and in particular a glass
   bottle) by adding to it the water-dilutable composition of the invention .

                                                 5
   [0033]                Still another related aspect of the present invention is the use of a
   composition comprising a C6-C12 fatty acid, propionic acid and lactic acid for sanitizing
   a (hard) surface (of a solid support, such as bottle), preferably this C6-C12 fatty acid
   being selected from the group consisting of hexanoic acid, heptanoic acid, octanoic
 5 acid, nonanoic acid, decanoic acid, undecanoic acid, undecyclenic acid, lauric acid,
   and mixtures thereof, more preferably being octanoic acid and/or undecyclenic acid;
   preferably this composition is detergent-free.
   [0034]                Another related aspect of the present invention is a method for
   sanitizing a (hard) surface (of a solid support, such as a bottle) comprising the step of
10 adding (to this surface) a composition comprising a first acid being a C6-C12 fatty acid
   and a second acid being a mixture of propionic acid and lactic acid, wherein this
   composition comprises at least 0.01 % of this first acid (weight first acid:weight
   composition) and wherein the weight ratio of this second acid and this first acid is of at
   least 8, preferably this first acid being selected from the group consisting of hexanoic
15 acid, heptanoic acid, octanoic acid, nonanoic acid, decanoic acid, undecanoic acid,
   undecyclenic acid, lauric acid, and mixtures thereof, more preferably being octanoic
   acid and/or undecyclenic acid.
   [0035]                Advantageously, this use or method does not comprise any water
   rinsing and/or washing step after the addition of this composition comprising this first
20 acid and this second acid. The present invention will be further described in the
   following description without limiting the invention scope
   Detailed description of the invention
   Table 1 shows the antimicrobial effect of the compositions of the present invention and
   of a composition not comprising the second acid.
25 [0036]                Although monocarboxylic fatty acids having a size of 6 to 12
   carbon atoms (i.e. about 8 carbon atom), such as octanoic acid, have a poor solubility
   in water, especially at temperatures of (about)    '0C to (about) 1O0C, the inventors have
   developed a (water-containing) sanitizing composition comprising them at high
   concentration, and such composition can be diluted with water.
30 [0037]                The inventors have further found that the addition of a mixture of
   lactic acid and of propionic acid has allowed to avoid the addition of artificial detergents
   (or to reduce their amounts, or to replace them by food-compatible detergents i.e.
   detergents that are not deleterious to food and that do not affect the health of the
   consumer), while still allowing monocarboxylic fatty acids having a size of about 8
35 carbon atoms to remain soluble and/or not forming fatty films on the sanitized surfaces.

                                                  6
   [0038]                  Such sanitizing composition can be in a concentrated form, as
   having a low freezing point below 5'C; in fact, advantageously, the concentrated
   composition of the present invention is stable and homogenous at temperatures
   between (about) 2'C and (about) 40'C.
 5 In such concentrated compositions, the amount of the monocarboxylic fatty acids
   having a size of 6 to 12 carbon atoms is advantageously above 1 % (w fatty acid: w
   composition), preferably above 5%, even possibly of above 6%, 7%, 8% and up to
   10%. The pH of such concentrated composition is below 5 (preferably between (about)
   1.0 and (about) 4.5).
10 [0039]                  On the other hand, the composition in the diluted form (in the
   dilution for use in sanitizing; e.g. with monocarboxylic fatty acids having a size of about
   8 carbons below 1 wt %, possibly below 0.1 wt % and even possibly at concentrations
   between (about) 0.01% (or 0.02) and (about) 0.05%) is also stable and homogenous at
   temperatures from 2'C to 40'C.
15 [0040]                  Conversely, despite the fact that the presence of organic acids,
   such as butyric acid, lactic acid and/or propionic acid and/or octanoic acid and/or of
   nonanoic acid, are believed to be detrimental for food quality (unpleasant odour, skin
   irritating properties), the inventors have found that sanitizing compositions based on
   such acids do not require supplementary rinsing steps, even when these compositions
20 are used for cleaning surfaces in the food or beverage (beer, wine, oil, dairy
   products,...) industry or are applied in direct contact onto solid food.
   [0041]                 Therefore, a first object of the present invention is related to a
   composition comprising a (one or more) (first) C6-C12 fatty acid, an acid (a second acid)
   being a mixture of lactic acid and propionic acid and possibly another (third) acid being
25 a strong mineral acid and/or citric acid and/or acetic acid and/or tartaric acid (and/or
   another dicarboxylic acids such as fumaric acid, malonic acid, oxalic acid, malic acid
   and succinic acid).
   [0042]                  In the context of the present invention, the term "C6-C12 fatty acid"
   broadly refers to any carboxylic acid having from 6 to 12 carbon atoms, preferably       "C6
30 C12   fatty acid" refers to hexanoic acid (caproic acid), heptanoic acid (enanthic acid),
   octanoic acid (caprylic acid), nonanoic acid (pelargonic acid), decanoic acid (capric
   acid), undecanoic acid (undecyclic acid), undecyclenic acid, lauric acid, and mixtures
   thereof; more preferably, in the present invention the (third) C6-C12 fatty acid comprises
   (consists (essentially) of) octanoic acid and/or undecyclenic acid (possibly in addition to
35 another C6-C12 fatty acid), still more preferably the C6-C12 fatty acid consists
   (essentially) of octanoic acid.

                                                 7
   [0043]                 Advantageously, this composition is antimicrobial (and/or it is a
   sanitizing composition).
   [0044]                 In the context of the present invention, the term "antimicrobial" or
 5 "microbiologically effective" refers to the possibility to reduce the amount of a (living)
   given (contaminant) microorganism by at least 100 000 fold (5 logs) in less than 20
   minutes at 3'C. Preferably, the (living and/or contaminant) microorganism is present on
   a surface. More preferably, "antimicrobial" or "microbiologically effective" refers to the
   capacity to simultaneously reduce (by at least 5 logs) the amount of several
10 microorganisms, for instance of bacteria (Gram (+) and/or Gram (-)) and of (several
   strains of) yeast (e.g. Saccharomyces sp., Candida Sp., Lactobacillus Sp.,...).
   [0045]                 Advantageously, this composition is water-dilutable.
   [0046]                 Advantageously, the water-dilutable (antimicrobial) composition of
   the present invention can be diluted (e.g. about 100-fold) and still keeps all its cleaning
15 properties, as well as the antimicrobial function.
   [0047]                 In the context of the present invention, the term "water-dilutable"
   refers to the fact that the composition, preferably the antimicrobial composition, can be
   used after a dilution with (sterile and/or soft and/or distilled and/or ozone-treated)
   water, such as a 10-fold, a 50-fold, a 100-fold or even a 200-fold dilution with water.
20 [0048]                 In the context of the present invention, unless explicitly stated
   otherwise, the percentages are weight percent (for instance weight of a given acid
   weight of the composition or weight ratios between given acids).
   [0049]                 Preferably, the second acid of the (antimicrobial and/or water
   dilutable) composition of the present invention is a mixture of lactic acid and propionic
25 acid, wherein preferably lactic acid represents at least 25 wt % of said mixture, more
   preferably at least 50 wt %, still more preferably at least 80 wt %).
   [0050]                 The (antimicrobial and/or water dilutable) composition according to
   the present invention comprises both lactic acid and propionic acid, in addition to a
   (first) C6-C12 fatty acid and possibly to another (third) acid such as a strong mineral
30 acid, citric acid, tartaric acid (and/or another dicarboxylic acids such as fumaric acid,
   malonic acid, oxalic acid, malic acid and succinic acid) or acetic acid, and possibly to
   another C2-C6 fatty acid substituted by one hydroxyl group at alpha or beta position
   and/or butyric acid and/or valeric acid.
   [0051]                 Advantageously, the C6-C12 fatty acid comprises (or consists
35 (essentially) of) octanoic acid.

                                                   8
   [0052]                 Preferably, the C6-C12 fatty acid (octanoic acid) is present in a
   microbiologically effective amount (for instance in an amount of between (about) 0.01
   wt % and (about) 0.1 wt % (preferably at least (about) 0.02%) in the diluted
   composition).
 5 [0053]                 In other words, the C6-C12 fatty acid (octanoic acid) of the water
   dilutable antimicrobial composition is advantageously present in an amount between
   (about) 1 wt % and (about) 10 wt % (weight of the C6-C10 fatty acid:weight of the water
   dilutable composition), preferably between (about) 2 wt % and (about) 8 wt %, more
   preferably between (about) 4 wt % and (about) 6 wt %, still more preferably between
10 (about) 5 wt % and (about) 5.5 wt %.
   [0054]                Advantageously,      the     (antimicrobial  and/or  water    dilutable)
   composition comprises a strong mineral acid, selected from the group consisting of
   nitric acid, phosphoric acid, chlorhydric acid and sulphuric acid, preferably the strong
   mineral acid is sulphuric acid.
15 [0055]                Alternatively or in addition to the strong mineral acid, the
   (antimicrobial and/or water dilutable) composition (further) comprises acetic acid and/or
   citric acid and/or tartaric acid (and/or another dicarboxylic acids such as fumaric acid,
   malonic acid, oxalic acid, malic acid and succinic acid).
   [0056]                 Preferably all the (first, second and, possibly third) acids are
20 present in the water-dilutable antimicrobial composition in a weight ratio comprised
   between 55% and 99%, more preferably between (about) 75% and (about) 90%, still
   more preferably between (about) 80% and (about) 85% (water representing more than
   50 wt% (or even almost all) of the remaining part).
   [0057]                 Preferably, the pH of the (antimicrobial and/or water dilutable)
25 composition of the present invention is comprised between (about) 1 and (about) 5,
   more preferably between (about) 2 and (about) 5.5, even more preferably between
   (about) 3 and (about) 4.5.
   [0058]                 Preferably, the (antimicrobial and/or water dilutable) composition of
   the present invention is detergent-free.
30 [0059]                 In the context of the present invention, the term "detergent-free"
   refers to the absence or to the reduction (i.e. less than 5 wt % in the water-dilutable
   composition, preferably less than 1 wt %, more preferably less than 0.1 wt %, still more
   preferably less than 0.01 wt % or even less than 0.001 wt %) of artificial detergents
   and/or of artificial emulsifiers and/or of artificial antifoaming agents and/or of detergent
35 being not considered as safe for food application.

                                                 9
   [0060]                In other words, in the "detergent-free" composition (almost) no

   [0086]               From   these results, the inventors conclude that all these
   compositions can reach the 5 log reduction threshold for all the contaminants
 5 microorganisms; however, some of the compositions are more potent (at higher
   dilutions, and also can exert stronger sanitizing effect at lower dilutions), and are even
   more potent than the reference (Septacid).
   [0087]               Furthermore, the compositions that do not comprise enough lactic
   acid and/or propionic acid require the addition of emulsifiers in order to remain
10 homogenous (e.g. at 4'C) and/or to exert antimicrobial effect, while compositions that
   do not comprise enough octanoic acid cannot be used at the highest dilutions.
   [0088]               The inventors have further compared compositions according to
   the invention (comprising, beside octanoic acid, sufficient amounts of propionic acid
   and/or of lactic acid) and compositions outside the present invention, comprising
15 octanoic acid, but without sufficient amounts of propionic acid and/or of lactic acid. The
   inventors have found that too low levels of these propionic acid and/or of lactic acid
   result into non-working compositions, unless emulsifiers are added. Furthermore, the
   inventors have observed that compositions comprising sufficient amounts of lactic acid
   and sufficient amounts of propionic acid are clearly the best ones; compositions

                                                16
   comprising only propionic acid are quite effective, but did not allow to incorporate equal
   amounts of octanoic acid, while compositions comprising only lactic acids are less
   potent in the cleaning conditions (loss of homogeneity, presence of a fat film).
   [0089]                The inventors have also tested compositions comprising strong
 5 mineral acids (sulphuric acid) and octanoic acid. However, these compositions were
   inefficient and/or not stable (homogenous) at low temperature, except with the addition
   of sufficient amounts of propionic acid and of lactic acid or of selected artificial (non
   food safe) emulsifiers.
   [0090]                The inventors have also tested compositions comprising organic
10 acids (not lactic acid nor propionic acids) and octanoic acid. However, these
   compositions (without lactic acid and propionic acid) were inefficient and/or not stable
   (homogenous) at low temperature, except with the addition of emulsifiers.
