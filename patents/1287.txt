   CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS
           [0001]    This application is a divisional of Australian patent application 2014303084,
15 which claims priority to US Provisional Patent Application 61/839,094 filed June 25, 2013, the
   contents of the entirety of which is incorporated by this reference.
   TECHNICAL FIELD
           [00021    Methods for producing natural cocoa products are disclosed. Natural, cocoa
20 products including, but not limited to, cocoa liquors, cocoa powders, and food products including
   such cocoa products are disclosed.
   BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
           [0003]    Cocoa bean processing includes fermenting harvested beans, drying the beans,
25 de-hulling the beans to produce nibs, sterilizing the nibs, roasting the nibs, crushing the nibs into
   cocoa liquor, and optionally pressing the cocoa liquor to obtain cocoa butter and cocoa powder.
           [0004]    Traditionally, natural cocoa products are light brown in color and have a pH in
   the range of 5.1 to 6.0. A typical L-value of 10 grams of a natural cocoa in 30 grams of water
   measured with a Hunterlab colorimeter is 20 or higher, and a- and b- values are 8.5 and higher.
30         [00051    In order to generate darker and more reddish color in cocoa products, a certain
   amount and type of alkali is added in an alkalization process. Alkalization is a process where
   cocoa products are alkalized under a certain amount of moisture, at a certain temperature,
   optionally under pressure, and for a certain amount of time. The alkalization process occurs in
   the presence of sodium, potassium, ammonium, or magnesium hydroxide or carbonate, for
35 example and without limitation, potash (K 2C0 3). The alkalization process alters the flavor,
   coloring, and solubility of the cocoa powder in water.
           [00061    Current commercial demands require a cocoa manufacturer to produce cocoa
   products in a broad palette of colors, flavors, or both. While each manufacturer understands that
   manipulation of processing conditions such as temperature, water content, duration of processing
                                                      1

   time, and pH will affect the color and flavor of the cocoa powder produced, there is no general
   consensus as to how to produce a cocoa product of a consistently desirable color, flavor, or both.
           10007]   While the alkalization process may be used to produce darker and/or more
   reddish cocoa products, the presence of the alkalizing agent also affects the labeling of such
 5 cocoa products. Such alkalized cocoa products are often labeled as being "processed with alkali."
   Thus, the presence of the alkalizing agent means such cocoa product cannot be considered
   "natural" and consumers are demanding "all natural" products. While some natural cocoa
   products do exist, most of them are light brown in color.
           [00081   Thus, a growing need exists for cocoa products that possess the color of
10 alkalized cocoa products, yet are considered "natural."
   SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
           [00091   In each of various embodiments, the present invention helps fulfill these needs
   and discloses processes for producing "natural" cocoa products that have the colors of alkalized
15 cocoa products. Natural, cocoa products produced by such methods are also disclosed.
           [0010]   In one embodiment, a process for producing a dark, natural cocoa includes
   mixing a cocoa product selected from the group consisting of cocoa nibs, cocoa beans, and a
   combination thereof with water, heating the cocoa product and the water to a temperature of at
   least 85'C, drying the cocoa product, and grinding the cocoa product, thus producing cocoa
20 liquor. The cocoa product is not alkalized during the process.
           [00111   In a further embodiment, a natural, cocoa product has a color value selected
   from the group consisting of an L-value of between about 9 and about 26, a C-value of between
   about 14 and about 29, an H-value of between about 40 and about 57, and combinations of any
   thereof. The natural, cocoa product also has a pH of less than about 6.
25
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
           10012]   In one embodiment, dark, natural cocoa is produced. The cocoa may be dark red
   or dark brown. The cocoa may be cocoa nibs, de-shelled cocoa beans, cocoa liquor, cocoa cake,
   or cocoa powder.
30         10013]   In a further embodiment, a process for producing the dark, natural cocoas
   includes mixing cocoa nibs, cocoa beans, or a combination thereof with water and heating the
   mixture to a temperature of at least 85'C. The process further includes drying the cocoa nibs, the
   cocoa beans, or the combination thereof and grinding the cocoa nibs, the cocoa beans, or the
                                                     2

   combination thereof, thus producing cocoa liquor. The cocoa product is not alkalized. The
   moisture of the cocoa cake in the water may be between about 35% and about 40%. The water
   and the cocoa nibs, the cocoa beans, or the combination thereof may also be heated to a
   temperature of between about 90'C and 130'C or a temperature of about 90'C to about 120'C.
 5         [00141    In another embodiment, the cocoa nibs, the cocoa beans, or the combination
   thereof and the water may be subjected to pressure, such as at least 0.5 Bar and even up to about
   4 Bar. The cocoa nibs, the cocoa beans, or the combination thereof may be reacted for a time of
   between about 0 and 300 minutes or for a time of about 30 and about 240 minutes.
           [00151    The cocoa product may be dried and optionally ground into cocoa liquor. The
10 cocoa liquor may be pressed into cocoa butter and cocoa cake. The cocoa cake may also be
   ground into a cocoa powder, which may have a fineness of a minimum of 98% through a 200
   mesh screen.
           [00161    In an embodiment, the cocoa product may be of a Cameroon origin, an Ivory
   Coast origin, and in other embodiments, may be of other origins.
15         [0017]    In yet an additional embodiment, the nibs, the de-shelled beans, or the
   combination thereof are sterilized.
           [0018]    In yet a further embodiment. the cocoa product may be roasted. The roasted
   cocoa product may be ground, thus producing cocoa liquor. The cocoa liquor may be separated
   into cocoa butter and cocoa presscake, or the cocoa liquor may be defatted. The cocoa presscake
20 may be further ground into cocoa powder. This process yields natural cocoa products having dark
   colors and such cocoa products may be unusually red, brown and red-brown.
           10019]    In another embodiment, the natural cocoa products of the present invention may
   have a dark color which refers to cocoa products with an L-value less than about 26.0. In other
   embodiments, the natural cocoa product may have an L value of between about 9 and about 25,
25 inclusive of intervals between those values. The natural cocoa product may also have a C-value
   of between about 15 and about 28, inclusive of intervals between those values. The natural cocoa
   product may also have an H-value of between about 40 and 55, inclusive of intervals between
   those values. The natural, cocoa product may also have a pH of less than about 7, less than about
   6, or between about 5 and about 6. The cocoa product may be a cocoa liquor or a cocoa powder.
30         10020]    In one embodiment, a starting material for the processes described herein may
   be de-shelled cocoa beans which refers to any suitable cocoa bean fraction/product having the
   shells substantially removed, broken, and/or winnowed. Non-limiting examples of de-shelled
   cocoa beans include, but are not limited to, nibs, kernels, and cotyledons. De-shelled cocoa beans

   typically contain a small fraction of contaminating shells that are within commercially acceptable
   tolerances since no de-shelling process is 100% complete.
           10021]    In an additional embodiment, the cocoa beans used to produce the natural cocoa
   products of the present invention are good fermented. In a further embodiment, the cocoa beans
 5 used to produce the natural cocoa products of the present invention are under- or un- fermented.
           [0022]    In one embodiment, the natural cocoa products produced herein are suitable for
   many commercial purposes, including, without limitation, food products. Examples of food
   products include, but are not limited to, chocolate, dark chocolate, milk chocolate, semi-sweet
   chocolate, baking chocolate, candies, pralines, truffles, candy bars, flavoring syrup,
10 confectionary coatings, compound coatings, fillings, beverages, milk, ice cream, beverage mixes,
   smoothies, soy milk, cakes, cheesecakes, cookies, pies, diet bars, meal-substitute solid foods and
   beverages, energy bars, chocolate chips, yogurt, yogurt drinks, pudding, mousse, mole,
   chocolates with lower bitterness, chocolate with fillings such as yogurt, and/or cheesecake.
           [00231    A number of objective methods for measuring the color of cocoa products are
15 known. In one method, the Hunter color system or CIE 1976 (CIELAB) and like systems, color
   may be described in terms of three parameters: Lightness (L)--the light or dark aspect of a color,
   where the lower the L-value, the darker the cocoa powder will appear; Chroma (C)-the intensity
   of a color by which one distinguishes a bright or gray color, where the higher the C-value, the
   brighter the powder will be; and Hue (H)- referring to color in daily speech, such as red, yellow,
20 or blue. For cocoa products, a low H value indicates a red color and a high H-value indicates a
   brown color.
           10024] The C values of the cocoa products of the present invention may be less than
   about 29, 28. 27, 26, 25, 24, 23, 22, 21, 20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 15, and 14 or lower, inclusive of
   intervals between those values. The C values may also be a range between about 14 and about
25 29, a range of between about 15 and about 28, or any ranges encompassed by the numbers 29,
   28, 27, 26, 25, 24, 23, 22, 21, 20 19, 18, 17, 16, 15, and 14.
           [00251 The L values of the cocoa products of the present invention may be in a range of
   between about 9 and about 26, a range of between about 10 and about 25, or any ranges
   encompassed by the numbers 26, 25, 24, 23, 22, 21, 20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, and
30 9.
                                                     4

             10026] The H values of the cocoa products of the present invention may be in a range of
   between about 40 and about 57, a range between about 50 and 55, or any ranges encompassed by
   the numbers 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, and 57.
             100271 The terms "red" or "redder" and "more red" are relative terms and refer to a cocoa
 5 product with an H value approximately in the range of from about 40 to about 45 (CIE 1976) that
   has an H value less than another, reference cocoa product. The terms "brown" and "browner"
   and "more brown" are relative terms and refer to a cocoa product with an H value approximately
   in the range of from about 45 to about 55 (CIE 1976) that has an H value greater than another,
   reference cocoa product.
10           [00281  The CIE 1976 color system describes colors in terms of coordinates L, "a*" and
   "b*". The L coordinate is consistent with the Value of Lightness, and from the a* and b*
   coordinates, the Chroma and Hue can be calculated as follows: C*= {square root over
   (a* 2 +b* 2)}; H=arctan(b*/a*).
             [00291  The spectral color is the result of the source of light and the reflecting surface.
15 For a good reproducible measurement of color, the source of light is standardized. There are two
   basic approaches for measuring color: visually or by instrumentation. There is a natural human
   tendency to trust only "one's own eyes." For this reason, colors are still frequently judged
   visually. To be able to do this in a reproducible manner, certain standard conditions should be
   met: the light source, for example and without limitation, a CIE standard light source; the
20 positions of the sample, relative to the light source, which are preferably at an angle of 450 to
   each other; the background of the sample, uniform and preferably gray; the distance between the
   eyes and the sample and position of the eyes relative to the sample; and the size of the sample.
             [0030]  In practice, color cabinets are used with standard light sources for visual color
   determinations. Color meters and spectrophotometers are used for instrument color readings.
25 Instrument color measurements were made in the Examples herein using a Datacolor
   Spectraflash 500 Color spectrophotometer in the manner described herein. Unless otherwise
   indicated, the color values described in the Examples, and all reference herein to color values L,
   C, H, a and b (a* and b*, respectively), are readings using the Datacolor Spectraflash 500 Color
   spectrophotometer. The color parameters described herein refer to the L, C, H parameters that
30 can be calculated from L, a, and b readings according to the CIE 1976 system. The color values
   recited herein are approximate in the sense that color measurements may vary from
   spectrophotometer-to-spectrophotometer, typically in the range of +/- 0.5 for L, C and H values.
                                                      5

   Therefore, the stated values for L, C and H are intended to include such variation inherent
   between spectrophotometers. The color values of cocoa powders, unless indicated otherwise, are
   obtained on samples of pulverized cocoa cakes (post pressing to remove cocoa butter) in water.
           [0031]    The following examples illustrate various non-limiting embodiments of the
 5 compositions within the present disclosure and are not restrictive of the invention as otherwise
   described or claimed herein.
   EXAMPLES
           [00321    Trials 1-8.
10         [00331    Charges of 25 kg of cocoa nibs produced from Ivory Coast beans were sterilized
   in a Drais reactor for 15-20 minutes with open steam at 1 Bar of pressure. After sterilization, the
   reactor was opened and aerated.
           [00341    5 kg (20 weight percent with the cocoa nibs) of hot tap water (65-70'C) was
   added to the cocoa nibs in the reactor and the reactor was closed. Open steam was injected into
15 the reactor to heat the cocoa nibs to the desired reaction temperature of about 100'C. The cocoa
   nibs were reacted under such conditions at 100'C for 30 minutes. After 30 minutes, the
   temperature of the cocoa nibs was reduced to 90'C by blowing air through the reactor. The cocoa
   nibs were re-heated with steam to the reaction temperature of 100 C. After another 30 minutes of
   reaction, the temperature of the cocoa nibs was reduced to 90'C by blowing air through the
20 reactor. The process of heating to 100 C and lowering to 90'C was repeated until the total
   reaction time of the cocoa nibs in the reactor was 240 minutes. Samples of cocoa nibs were
   removed from the reactor at the time intervals or reaction times listed in Table 1, i.e., 0-240
   minutes. The reaction was done with outlet valves being open at atmospheric pressure. The
   temperature was controlled during the reaction using the temperature of the jacket of the reactor
25 and steam injection.
           [0035]    After being reacted for the time specified in Table 1, samples of the cocoa nibs
   were removed from the reactor. The cocoa nibs were dried in a Retsch laboratory fluidized bed
   dryer (jet roasting). During drying, the moisture content of the cocoa nibs was reduced from
   about 35-40% to less than 2.5%.
30         10036]    The dried cocoa nibs were ground into cocoa liquor and the cocoa liquor was
   pressed into cocoa cakes and cocoa butter. The cocoa cakes were broken into smaller pieces and
   pulverized into cocoa powder with a Retsch cutting mill using sieves having holes of 0.5 mm in
   diameter.
                                                      6

             10037]     The colors (defatted liquor), pH, and moisture of the cocoa liquor were
  determined. The cocoa powders were analyzed for pH, moisture content, fat content, and intrinsic
  color in water. Pressed cocoa butter was filtered and analyzed for free fatty acids and iodine
  value. Results of the analysis and specific process conditions are presented in the following
5 tables.

              [0041]      Charges of 25 kg of cocoa nibs were sterilized in a Drais reactor for 15-20
   minutes with open steam at I Bar of pressure. After sterilization, the reactor was opened and
 5  aerated.
              [0042]      5 kg (20 weight percent with the cocoa nibs) of hot tap water (65-70'C) was
    added to the cocoa nibs in the reactor and the reactor was closed. Open steam was injected into
   the reactor to heat the cocoa nibs to the desired reaction temperature. The steam inlet valve was
    closed and the air inlet valve was opened to inject additional air into the reactors to reach a
10 pressure of about 3 Bar. The cocoa nibs were reacted under such conditions at the temperature
    (ranging from 120-140'C) and time (ranging from 0-240 minutes) as specified Tables 3 and 4.
    The temperature was controlled during the reaction using the temperature of the jacket of the
   reactor. After the reaction, the reactor was aerated by closing the air inlet valve and opening the
    outlet valves, and the pressure on the cocoa nibs was released. Air was injected through the open
15  outlet valves into the reactor to reduce the temperature of the cocoa nibs in the reactor to about
    800 C.
              [0043]      The procedure of closing the outlet valves and introducing steam to the desired
   reaction temperature and aerating the reactor was repeated several times for some of the trials.
    The temperature of the cocoa nibs during the reaction was controlled by the temperature of the
20 jacket which was in the range of 120-140'C. The average reaction temperature of the cocoa nibs

   in the reactor was 120'C during the reaction time of 0-240 minutes. Samples of cocoa nibs were
   removed from the reactor at the time intervals or reaction times listed in Tables 3 and 4, i.e., 0
   240 minutes.
             [0044]      After the reaction, the reactor was aerated and samples of the cocoa nibs (Trials
 5 9-19) were removed from the reactor.
             [0045]      The cocoa nibs were dried in a Retsch laboratory fluidized bed dryer (jet
   roasting). During drying, the moisture content of the cocoa nibs was reduced from about 35-40%
   to less than 2.5%.
             [00461      The dried cocoa nibs were ground into cocoa liquor and the cocoa liquor was
10 pressed into cocoa cakes and cocoa butter. The cocoa cakes were broken into smaller pieces and
   pulverized into cocoa powder with a Retsch cutting mill using sieves having holes of 0.5 mm in
   diameter.
             [00471      The colors, pH, and other parameters of the cocoa liquor and cocoa powder were
   determined. Results of the analysis and specific process conditions performed are presented on
15 Tables 3-5.
