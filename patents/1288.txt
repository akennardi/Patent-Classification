   controller 150 is in data communication over a network 2,
   such as an Ethernet, with a bank of five gaming devices in
15 the form of standalone gaming machines 10.      The bonus
   controller 150 is arranged to communicate with the gaming
   devices to determine which gaming devices are eligible.
   When a bonus condition is met, the bonus game controller
   150 makes a bonus award to one or more of gaming devices
20 10.  The gaming system is arranged to apply the bonus
   award in dependence on the state of the gaming devices,
   for example the gaming devices 10 may be arranged to
   select a manner of applying the bonus award based on their
   own state.
25
   Gaming devices
   Gaming devices capable of participating in the method of
   gaming of the embodiment can take any suitable form
30 including stand alone gaming machines and server based
   gaming terminals.
   A gaming device in the form of a stand alone gaming
   machine 10 is illustrated in Figure 2.  The gaming machine
35 10 includes a console 12 having a display 14 on which are
   displayed representations of a game 16 that can be played
   by a player.  A mid-trim 20 of the gaming machine 10
                                             10314269_1 (GHMatters) P82091.AU.4 5/06/18

                               - 8
   houses a bank of buttons 22 for enabling a player to
   interact with the gaming machine, in particular during
   game play.   The mid-trim 20 also houses a credit input
   mechanism 24 which in this example includes a coin input
 5 chute 24A and a bill collector 24B.   Other credit input
   mechanisms may also be employed, for example, a card
   reader for reading a smart card, debit card or credit
   card.   Other gaming machines may be configured for ticket
   in that they have a ticket reader for reading tickets
10 having a value and crediting the player based on the face
   value of the ticker.   A player marketing module (not
   shown) having a reading device may also be provided for
   the purpose of reading a player tracking device, for
   example as part of a loyalty program.   The player tracking
15 device may be in the form of a card, flash drive or any
   other portable storage medium capable of being read by the
   reading device.   In some embodiments, the player marketing
   module may provide an additional credit mechanism, either
   by transferring credits to the gaming machine from credits
20 stored on the player tracking device or by transferring
   credits from a player account in data communication with
   the player marketing module.
   A top box 26 may carry artwork 28, including for example
25 pay tables and details of bonus awards and other
   information or images relating to the game.        Further
   artwork and/or information may be provided on a front
   panel 29 of the console 12.   A coin tray 30 is mounted
   beneath the front panel 29 for dispensing cash payouts
30 from the gaming machine 10.
   The display 14 shown in Figure 2 is in the form of a video
   display unit, particularly a cathode ray tube screen
   device.   Alternatively, the display 14 may be a liquid
35 crystal display, plasma screen, any other suitable video
   display unit, or the visible portion of an
   electromechanical device.   The top box 26 may also include
                                              10314269_1 (GHMatters) P82091.AU.4 5/06/18

                               - 9
   a display, for example a video display unit, which may be
   of the same type as the display 14, or of a different
   type.

   a typical gaming machine which may be the same as or
   different to the gaming machine of Figure 2.
   The gaming machine 100 includes a game controller 101
10 having a processor 102 mounted on a circuit board.
   Instructions and data to control operation of the
   processor 102 are stored in a memory 103, which is in data
   communication with the processor 102.   Typically, the
   gaming machine 100 will include both volatile and non
15 volatile memory and more than one of each type of memory,
   with such memories being collectively represented by the
   memory 103.  Herein the term "processor" is used to refer
   generically to any device that can process game play
   instructions in accordance with game play rules and may
20 include: a microprocessor, microcontroller, programmable
   logic device or other computational device, a general
   purpose computer  (e.g. a PC) or a server.     That is a
   processor may be provided by any suitable logic circuitry
   for receiving inputs, processing them in accordance with
25 instructions stored in memory   and generating outputs                    (for
   example on the display).   Such processors are sometimes
   also referred to as central processing units (CPUs). Most
   processors are general purpose units, however, it is also
   know to provide a specific purpose processor using an
30 application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) or a field
   programmable gate array (FPGA).
   The gaming machine has hardware meters 104 for purposes
   including ensuring regulatory compliance and monitoring
35 player credit, an input/output (I/0) interface 105 for
   communicating with peripheral devices of the gaming
   machine 100.  The input/output interface 105 and/or the
                                              10314269_1 (GHMatters) P82091.AU.4 5/06/18

                               - 10
   peripheral devices may be intelligent devices with their
   own memory for storing associated instructions and data
   for use with the input/output interface or the peripheral
   devices.   A random number generator module 113 generates
 5 random numbers for use by the processor 102.          Persons
   skilled in the art will appreciate that the reference to
   random numbers includes pseudo-random numbers.
   In the example shown in Figure 3, a player interface 120
10 includes peripheral devices that communicate with the game
   controller 101 including one or more displays 106, a touch
   screen and/or buttons 107   (which provide a game play
   mechanism),  a card and/or ticket reader 108, a printer
   109, a bill acceptor and/or coin input mechanism 110 and a
15 coin output mechanism 111.    Additional hardware may be
   included as part of the gaming machine 100, or hardware
   may be omitted as required for the specific
   implementation.   For example, while buttons or touch
   screens are typically used in gaming machines to allow a
20 player to place a wager and initiate a play of a game any
   input device that enables the player to input game play
   instructions may be used.
   In addition, the gaming machine 100 may include a
25 communications interface, for example a network card 112.
   The network card may, for example, send status
   information, accounting information or other information
   to a bonus controller, central controller, server or
   database and receive data or commands from the bonus
30 controller, central controller, server or database.                   In
   embodiments employing a player marketing module,
   communications over a network may be via player marketing
   module -  i.e. the player marketing module may be in data
   communication with one or more of the above devices and
35 communicate with it on behalf of the gaming machine.
   Figure 4 shows a block diagram of the main components of
                                              10314269_1 (GHMatters) P82091.AU.4 5/06/18

                              - 11
   an exemplary memory 103.  The memory 103 includes RAM
   103A, EPROM 103B and a mass storage device 103C.              The RAM
   103A typically temporarily holds program files for
   execution by the processor 102 and related data.              The
 5 EPROM 103B may be a boot ROM device and/or may contain
   some system or game related code.  The mass storage device
   103C is typically used to store game programs, the
   integrity of which may be verified and/or authenticated by
   the processor 102 using protected code from the EPROM 103B
10 or elsewhere.
   It is also possible for the operative components of the
   gaming machine 100 to be distributed, for example
   input/output devices 106,107,108,109,110,111 to be
15 provided remotely from the game controller 101.
   In a client server architecture a gaming device is
   provided by a gaming client and game server (and
   optionally other gaming network components). A gaming
20 client has a similar outward appearance to gaming machine
   10 but the game server implements most or all of the game
   and as such acts as the game controller while the terminal
   operated by the player essentially provides only the
   player interface.  The gaming terminal receives player
25 instructions, pass these to the game server which will
   process them and return game play outcomes to the gaming
   machine for display.  Further details of a client/server
   gaming architecture can be found in WO 2006/052213 and
   PCT/SE2006/000559, the disclosures of which are
30 incorporated herein by reference. In such an embodiment, a
   bonus controller can be provided, for example, by a
   dedicated server in data communication with the game
   server.
35 Figure 5 shows that a gaming device may be connected
   within a gaming network 200 which provides additional
   and/or enhanced functionality.  The gaming network 200
                                             10314269_1 (GHMatters) P82091.AU.4 5/06/18

                              - 12
   includes a network 201, which for example may be an
   Ethernet network.  Gaming machines 202, shown arranged in
   three banks 203 of two gaming machines 202 in Figure 5,
   are connected to the network 201.  The gaming machines 202
 5 provide a player operable interface and may be the same as
   the gaming machines 10,100 shown in Figures 2 and 3. While
   banks 203 of two gaming machines are illustrated in Figure
   5, banks of one, three or more gaming machines are also
   envisaged.
10
   One or more displays 204 may also be connected to the
   network 201.  For example, the displays 204 may be
   associated with one or more banks 203 of gaming machines.
   The displays 204 may be used to display representations
15 associated with game play on the gaming machines 202,
   and/or used to display other representations, for example
   promotional or informational material.
   A bonus controller can be provided within such a network
20 200 by bonus server 205, such that the bonus server may
   implement a bonus for a plurality of different banks of
   gaming machines rather than a specific controller being
   provided for each bank of gaming machines.
25 A database management server 206 may manage storage of
   game programs and associated data for downloading or
   access by the gaming devices 202 in a database 206A.
   Typically, if the gaming system enables players to
   participate in a Jackpot game, a Jackpot server 207 will
30 be provided to perform accounting functions for the
   Jackpot game.  A loyalty program server 212 may also be
   provided.
   Servers are also typically provided to assist in the
35 administration of the gaming network 200, including for
   example a gaming floor management server 208, and a
   licensing server 209 to monitor the use of licenses
                                             10314269_1 (GHMatters) P82091.AU.4 5/06/18

                              - 13
   relating to particular games.   An administrator terminal
   210 is provided to allow an administrator to run the
   network 201 and the devices connected to the network.
 5 The gaming network 200 may communicate with other gaming
   systems, other local networks, for example a corporate
   network, and/or a wide area network such as the Internet,
   for example through a firewall 211.
10 Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that in
   accordance with known techniques, functionality at the
   server side of the network may be distributed over a
   plurality of different computers.   For example, elements
   may be run as a single "engine" on one server or a
15 separate server may be provided.   For example, the game
   server 205 could run a random generator engine.
   Alternatively, a separate random number generator server
   could be provided.  Further, persons skilled in the art
   will appreciate that a plurality of game servers could be
20 provided to run different games or a single game server
   may run a plurality of different games as required by the
   terminals.
   Figure 9 is a functional block diagram of a gaming device
25 in the form of a stand alone gaming machine.         The gaming
   device 900 may be the same or different to gaming machine
   10,100 described above.  The games played on the
   individual gaming devices may be the same or different and
   may be for example a spinning reel type game.          The player
30 operates the game play mechanism 912 to specify a wager
   and hence the win entitlement which will be evaluated for
   this play of the game and initiates a play of the game.
   Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that a player's
   win entitlement will vary from game to game dependent on
35 player selections.  In most spinning reel games, it is
   typical for the player's win entitlement to be affected by
   the amount they wager and selections they make          (i.e. the
                                             10314269_1 (GHMatters) P82091.AU.4 5/06/18

                               - 14
   nature of the wager).   For example, a player's           win
   entitlement may be based on how many lines they play in
   each game - e.g. a minimum of one line up to the maximum
   number of lines allowed by the game    (noting that not all
 5 permutations of win lines may be available for selection)
   and how much they wager per line.    Such win lines are
   typically formed by a combination of symbol display
   positions, one from each reel, the symbol display
   positions being located relative to one another such that
10 they form a line.
   In many games, the player's win entitlement is not
   strictly limited to the lines they have selected, for
   example, "scatter" pays are awarded independently of a
15 players selection of pay lines and are an inherent part of
   the win entitlement.
   Persons skilled in the art, will appreciate that in other
   embodiments, the player may obtain a win entitlement by
20 selecting a number of reels to play and an amount to wager
   per reel. Such games are marketed under the trade name
   "Reel Power" by Aristocrat Leisure Industries Pty Ltd.
   The selection of the reel means that each displayed symbol
   of the reel can be substituted for a symbol at one or more
25 designated display positions.    In other words, all symbols
   displayed at symbol display positions corresponding to a
   selected reel can be used to form symbol combinations with
   symbols displayed at  a designated,  symbol display
   positions of the other reels.    For example,       if     there are
30 five reels and three symbol display positions for each
   reel such that the symbol display positions comprise three
   rows of five symbol display positions, the symbols
   displayed in the centre row are used for non-selected
   reels.  As a result, the total number of ways to win is
35 determined by multiplying the number of active display
   positions of each reels, the active display positions
   being all display positions of each selected reel and the
                                                 10314269_1 (GHMatters) P82091.AU.4 5/06/18

                              - 15
   designated display position of the non-selected reels.                      As
   a result for five reels and fifteen display positions
   there are 243 ways to win.
 5 In other embodiments a player win entitlement may be
   affected by purchasing access to particular pay tables
   e.g. a first bet amount entitles the player to wins
   including cherries and a second amount entitles them to
   wins including plums.

   In Figure 9, the processor 930 of game controller 920 is
   shown implementing a number of modules based on program
   code and data stored in memory 940.   Persons skilled in
   the art will appreciate that various of the modules could
15 be implemented in some other way, for example by a
   dedicated circuit.
   The gaming device 900 includes a player interface 910
   having a display 911 for displaying game outcomes to a
20 player and a game play mechanism 912 including input
   devices such as touch screen or buttons to enable the
   player to interact with the game by placing wagers and
   entering any other instructions required to play the game.
   Game play mechanism 912 also enables the player to
25 interact with the game to learn game rules etc.             The
   player interface 910 includes a credit mechanism 913
   allowing the player to input credit into the gaming device
   900 and/or be paid out any winnings or remaining credit.
   A person skilled in the art will appreciate that other
30 components will be present in a gaming device 900 such as
   those described in relation to Figures 2 to 4 above.                    The
   memory 940 includes program code for implementing a game
   including game rule data 941 for implementing the rules of
   a game playable on the gaming device.
35
   The processor 930 when executing the program code stored
   in memory 940 is arranged to generate outcomes of the game
                                             10314269_1 (GHMatters) P82091.AU.4 5/06/18

                               - 16
   in response to the operation of the game play mechanism
   912.   The outcomes are generated with the outcome
   generator 931.   The outcome evaluator 932 evaluates the
   game outcomes that are generated based on the wager
 5 specified with the game play mechanism 912 and updates
   credit data 942 which stores a credit meter and a win
   meter for the game.   The processor 930 also implements a
   communication module 933 which is intended to communicate
   by communication interface 950 with a bonus controller.
10 As will be described in further detail below the
   communication module is arranged to indicate to the bonus
   controller whether the gaming device 900 is eligible to
   participate in a bonus game.
15 Accordingly, the communication module includes a
   eligibility module 933A which is intended to determine
   based on eligibility rule data whether the gaming device
   900 is eligible to participate in the bonus.          In one
   example, eligibility rule data 943 specifies a time period
20 and participation sub-module 933A determines whether a
   game has been concluded within a defined time period prior
   to receipt of a polling request from the bonus controller
   150   (as described below).   Alternatively, eligibility
   module 933A communicates when the last game is completed.
25 In this manner, the bonus controller 150 can determine
   whether the gaming device 900 is currently being played
   and is eligible to participate in the bonus game when it
   is initiated.   In some embodiments, additional or
   different eligibility criteria may apply, for example the
30 player may have to place a maximum bet, play maximum
   lines, or place an ante bet in order to be eligible.
   In the embodiment, the bonus game is triggered by an
   outcome occurring on one of the gaming devices in data
35 communication with the bonus controller and accordingly,
   the outcome evaluator includes a trigger monitor 932A for
   monitoring that a trigger condition has been met by an
                                              10314269_1 (GHMatters) P82091.AU.4 5/06/18

                              - 17
   outcome of the game generated by the outcome generator
   932.  When a trigger event occurs, the trigger monitor
   communicates the trigger event to the communication module
   which outputs data indicative of the trigger event via
 5 communication interface 950.
   Bonus controller and its operation within the gaming
   system
10 Referring to Figure 6 there is shown further detail of the
   bonus controller 150.  From Figure 6 it will be apparent
   that bonus controller 150 is in data communication with a
   communal display 160 which can be used to advertise the
   bonus game or indicate that the bonus game is in progress.
15
   Referring to Figure 6, the constitution of the bonus
   controller 150 is similar to that of the gaming device
   illustrated in relation to Figures 2 to 4 and 9 in that it
   has a processor 151 arranged to implement the bonus based
20 on program code stored in memory 152 and a display driver
   154 for driving the display 160 to show the bonus outcome.
   The bonus controller 150 also includes a communication
   interface 153 which is designed to enable the processor
   151 to communicate with each of the gaming devices 10.
25
   Persons skilled in the art will appreciate the above
   components are the core components for implementing a
   bonus but other components may be present in a bonus
   controller.  Persons skilled in the art will appreciate
30 that the implementation of the bonus controller is
   analogous to the implementation of jackpot controllers in
   existing gaming systems and reference may be made to such
   jackpot controllers for further details of implementation.
35 Figure 7 is a functional block diagram of the bonus game
   controller 150 which shows that the processor 151
   implements a number of modules in a similar manner to the
                                             10314269_1 (GHMatters) P82091.AU.4 5/06/18

                               - 18
   processor of the gaming device shown in Figure 9.                 The
   processor 151 executes program code stored in memory 152
   to instantiate a number of modules including trigger
   monitor 706 which monitors for trigger data transmitted
 5 from one of the gaming devices. Once a trigger is
   received, trigger monitor activates bonus award controller
   701 and an eligibility module 703 which communicates via
   data communication interface 153 with each of the gaming
   devices.   In one example, this communication includes
10 polling each of the gaming devices.   In another example
   this may be by listening to output on the network from
   each of the individual gaming devices.   In any event, the
   eligibility module 703 determines which gaming devices are
   eligible. Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that
15 there are other techniques for enforcing eligibility, for
   example, it may be that the gaming devices determine
   themselves whether they are eligible to apply a bonus
   award sent to them from the bonus controller.
20 That is, when the trigger is received by the trigger
   monitor 709, eligibility module 703 polls each of the
   gaming machines to determine whether they have been active
   within a defined period.   The eligibility module 933A of
   each gaming device 900 outputs whether they are active at
25 the time based on the eligibility rule data 943 as well as
   data allowing the gaming device to be identified and data
   required to determine how to share any award (if
   necessary).   From these responses, eligibility module 703
   determines  the identity and number of active gaming
30 devices.
   The award determiner 701A then determines which awards to
   make to the eligible gaming devices based on bonus award
   rule data 710 and random trials conducted by the random
35 number generator 705. For example, bonus awards may be
   made to all gaming devices in some embodiments, a random
   number of gaming devices, or at different levels to
                                              10314269_1 (GHMatters) P82091.AU.4 5/06/18

                               - 19
   different devices or a combination thereof.        If there are
   different levels, the award determiner includes a bonus
   level determiner 701B which determines which level award
   is to be applied for each gaming device to which a bonus
 5 award is to be made.   The bonus awards may be made in
   response to the trigger (i.e. when the bonus event
   begins), or at varying times during the bonus event.
   In one exemplary embodiment, the bonus event is conducted
10 for a defined period. Accordingly, the bonus award
   controller 701 communicates bonus award data to each of
   the individual gaming devices 10 at which an award is to
   be provided.  This communication being via data
   communication interface in the general manner of
15 communications described above.   Each of the individual
   gaming devices confirm that they have received the bonus
   award data and that they are prepared to start the bonus
   award. A bonus event starter function 710C of the bonus
   award controller 701 then starts the bonus award sequence
20 by broadcasting to each of the gaming devices they should
   apply the bonus award.   The bonus award controller also
   includes a bonus event ender 701D for communicating to
   each of the gaming devices that the bonus event is to be
   ended (in the above example when the defined time period
25 specified in bonus award rule data 710 has expired).
   It will be appreciated that in other embodiments, the
   bonus event may end in some other manner, for example it
   may end when another condition is met, for example a
30 particular game event occurring on one of the individual
   gaming devices. In such an embodiment, the occurrence of
   the event is communicated by the relevant gaming device to
   the bonus controller 701 and the bonus event ender 701D
   communicates the end of the bonus event to the other
35 gaming devices. A variation of the embodiment, a gaming
   device which produces the relevant game event ending the
   bonus award may communicate this directly to each of the
                                              10314269_1 (GHMatters) P82091.AU.4 5/06/18

                              - 20
   other gaming devices by broadcasting it on the network.
   Once the individual gaming devices 10 receive the bonus
   award data, this is passed by communication module 933 to
 5 a bonus award controller 934.   The bonus award controller
   includes a state determiner 934A which determines a
   current state of the gaming device and an award selector
   934B which selects an award to apply from bonus award data
   944 based on the state of the gaming device.          In one
10 example, the game rule data 941 may provide for a base
   game which is conducted for each play of the game and a
   feature game which is conducted when a specific condition
   is met during the base game.   An example of the state
   determiner 934A operating is for the state determiner to
15 determine whether a base game or a feature game is
   currently being played and for the award selector 934B to
   select a different award depending on whether the base
   game or feature game is the current state of the machine.
   There are many other examples of how the state may differ,
20 for example in some games, a player may accrue symbols
   which can be used during ongoing play of the game and the
   state could be dependent on the number of symbols which
   have been accrued.  In any event, it will be appreciated
   that the bonus award controller 934 operates to integrate
25 the bonus award with the current state of the machine.                       A
   person skilled in the art will appreciate that there will
   be other variables for selecting the award including the
   identity of the game being played   (where different games
   are played on the connected gaming devices, either because
30 the specific gaming devices offer different games or a
   player has selected from a plurality of different games
   playable on the gaming device) or the level of the award
   where different awards are available.
35 Once the bonus award controller 934 determines the award
   to be applied, it advises one or both of the outcome
   generator 931 and outcome evaluator 932 the modification
                                              10314269_1 (GHMatters) P82091.AU.4 5/06/18

                              - 21
   of the game rule data to apply,   for example by
   controlling which program code  (of parts thereof) stored
   in memory 940 is used.  That is, either the manner in
   which outcomes are generated or the manner in which they
 5 are evaluated or both is changed by the bonus award
   controller 934.  Each modification is intended to have a
   positive impact on game play, but persons skilled in the
   art will appreciate that it could be possible to have one
   or more "unlucky games" where the bonus award provides no
10 or a negative impact on game play.   The outcome generator
   931 continues to generate results after the modification
   in accordance with play of the game and these are
   evaluated by the outcome evaluator 932 and any awards to
   be made to the player are added to win meter stored as
15 meter data 942 and displayed to the player on display 911.
   The method of the embodiment is summarised in Figure 8.
   The method 800 involves, subsequent to a trigger occurring
   810, determining which of the eligible gaming devices 10
20 are to receive a bonus award 820. In the example of Figure
   8, the method involves determining the level of award 830.
   Any bonus awards are communicated to individual gaming
   devices 840 and it is determined what is the current state
   is of the gaming machine 850. The method then involves
25 selecting the manner in which the award is to be applied
   based on the state of the gaming device 860 and applying
   the award during game play 870.
   The bonus award is then applied until the bonus event
30 ends, at which time the bonus controller will stop the
   application of the modification.
   It will be appreciated that in the above embodiment one or
   more gaming devices will experience one or more positive
35 impacts on game play, the types of which will be
   identified by the game state they are in when the award is
   in progress.  If a gaming device changes from one game
                                             10314269_1 (GHMatters) P82091.AU.4 5/06/18

                               - 22
   state to another during a bonus award, for example if it
   moves from a base game to a feature game, the type of
   positive impact can change according to the changed game
   state under the control of the bonus award controller 734.
 5 That is, the game controller can be arranged to change the
   bonus award which is applied or can be arranged to change
   the manner in which a bonus award is applied.          As
   described above, when the bonus game award ceases, for
   example either randomly, via a special feature or through
10 one of the existing base game features, there will be no
   more positive impacts until the next bonus award.                It will
   be appreciated that the bonus award length can also be
   determined randomly by time, be a defined time, based on
   turnover, number of feature games played, number of bonus
15 awards given, an amount of extra return to player awarded
   or a combination of some or all of those factors.
   Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that while the
   above example describes the bonus being triggered, the
20 bonus could instead be carried out in response to some
   other bonus condition being met, for example, periodically
   with each gaming device that played in a previous time
   period being entitled to share in any awards the bonus.
25 Further aspects of the method will be apparent from the
   above description of the gaming system and that at least
   part of the method will be implemented digitally by a
   processor. Persons skilled in the art will also appreciate
   that the method could be embodied in program code. The
30 program code could be supplied in a number of ways, for
   example on a computer readable storage medium, such as a
   disc or a memory  (for example, that could replace part of
   memory 103) or as a data signal  (for example, by
   transmitting it from a server).  Persons skilled in the
35 art, will appreciate that program code provides a series
   of instructions executable by the processor.
                                             10314269_1 (GHMatters) P82091.AU.4 5/06/18

                              - 23
   Example 1
   There is a linked bank of 6 eligible electronic gaming
 5 machines EGMs.  Player 1 triggers the Bonus Event, and in
   the process gets awarded a credit prize.
   Player 2 is playing the base game during the Bonus Event,
   and thus all wins (or some wins, randomly determined or
10 pre-determined) are multiplied by a random multiplier.
   Player 3 is playing the Free Game Feature during the Bonus
   Event, and thus gets awarded extra WILDs in the window for
   all (or some) spins for the duration of the Bonus Event.
15
   Player 4 is playing the Match and Win Feature during the
   Bonus Event, and thus gets warded extra multipliers of
   extra Bonus symbols for the duration of the Bonus Event.
20 Player 5 is playing the base game, and because he is
   unlucky, does not receive any bonuses from the Bonus
   Event.
   Player 6 is playing the base game, and then gets awarded
25 the Jackpot Feature.  He wins the Jackpot Progressive, and
   in the process, the Bonus Event ceases for the entire bank
   of linked EGMs.
   Example 2 - Jurassic Park
30
   "Jurassic Park" is a game for a bank of linked EGMs with
   progressive Jackpots, all with the Jurassic Park theme.
   A bonus event can be triggered that has seamless
35 integration with the current game state in all          (or some
   randomly selected) EGMs on the bank.
                                             10314269_1 (GHMatters) P82091.AU.4 5/06/18

                              - 24
   The premise is that, like the movie of the same name,
   Jurassic Park has been built and is functioning as a
   state-of-the-art theme park open for tourists and dinosaur
   lovers alike.  But as with all theme parks, it's not
 5 totally without its "hiccups".
   The game will have numerous features featuring each of the
   park's most spectacular attractions.
10    e T-Rex feeding feature
      * Velociraptor feature
      * Triceratops feature
      * Brontosaurus feature
      * Pterodactyl feature
15
   Each of these features will have its unique mini-game
   where the player will win credit prizes  (and maybe
   progressives).
20 But sometimes, during the T-Rex feeding feature the
   electric fence will malfunction and the T-Rex will become
   loose and roam around the park causing mayhem.           This will
   trigger the T-REX BONUS EVENT which will be communicated
   throughout the whole bank via display 160 sequences,
25 sounds, music, lights and/or maybe a physical warning
   light/siren of top of the EGM.
   During the T-REX BONUS EVENT, the T-REX has the potential
   to come up to ANY eligible machine on the bank of EGMs and
30 help the player win credit prizes or progressives.                 Also
   T-REX could come up on a number of multiple EGMs for the
   duration of the T-REX BONUS EVENT until he is captured or
   subdued.
35 For example, if a player is playing the base game while
   the T-REX BONUS EVENT is in progress, the T-REX could
   appear on the game window and bite/stomp one or more of
                                             10314269_1 (GHMatters) P82091.AU.4 5/06/18

                              - 25
   the "dinosaur" base game symbols and create bonus WILDs in
   the process.
   In one example, the Pterodactyl feature has the player
 5 riding a flying dinosaur and the aim is to drop things
   down and hit targets on the ground to win credit prizes
   and/or progressives.  If the T-REX BONUS EVENT is
   triggered as the player is flying around trying to hit
   targets, the T-REX can be seen chasing some smaller
10 dinosaurs along the ground, stomping/hitting some of the
   targets and in the process, helping the player.
   In addition to these random T-REX sightings, in one
   example there is a special T-REX JACKPOT FEATURE where the
15 player would have to aid in the capture of the T-REX in
   order to win a Progressive Jackpot.   If the player is not
   successful in capturing the T-REX, the T-REX BONUS EVENT
   will continue and another player (or the same player,
   determined by chance) would have a chance at subduing the
20 T-REX, this time for a bigger jackpot  (higher progressive
   level).  This BONUS EVENT would continue until a player is
   successful in capturing the T-REX.
   Once the T-REX has been captured, the T-REX BONUS EVENT
25 would cease until the T-REX has a chance to escape again.
   It will be understood to persons skilled in the art of the
   invention that many modifications may be made without
   departing from the spirit and scope of the invention, in
30 particular it will be apparent that certain features of
   embodiments of the invention can be employed to form
   further embodiments.
