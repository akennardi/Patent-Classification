               [ABSTRACT]
             The     present       invention          relates       to     an     insulinotropic
   peptide        derivative        with     a   modified       N-terminal           charge       and    a
   pharmaceutical composition                    including the same.                  Specifically,
 5 the      insulinotropic          peptide         derivative         is    characterized             in
   that       the    N-terminal       positive           charge     of    the     insulinotropic
   peptide        is   modified      to   a     neutral      or   net     negative         charge      at
   neutral pH.             The   insulinotropic peptide derivative according
   to      the   present        invention        is     rapidly      dissociated            from     the
10 GLP-1       receptor        owing   to      the      above   modification             in     the    N
   terminal           charge,       and       exhibits         enhanced           insulinotropic
   ability       and blood         glucose-lowering           activity          compared         to  the
   native           insulinotropic             peptide        while          maintaining             its
   stability in blood.                Accordingly, the              insulinotropic peptide
15 derivative          of    the   present       invention       is    very      useful       for    the

              The   present             invention          relates       to      an    insulinotropic
   peptide         derivative             which         is     modified        to    have        increased

   the        present       invention            is       characterized           in     that      the       N
   terminal        charge         of    the   insulinotropic peptide                   is modified to

               Peptides        can       be    easily          denatured        due     to     their       low
   stability,          lose       their      activities          via    degradation           by   in-vivo
   proteolytic           enzymes,           and      are      so  small       so   as    to    be    easily
20 removed         through           the      kidney.            Accordingly,            in     order        to
   maintain the blood                   levels       and the      titers       of a pharmaceutical
   drug        containing            a    peptide          as    a   pharmaceutically                active
   component,           it       is     necessary           to    frequently         administer            the
   peptide drug to a patient.
25             However,          most       peptide            drugs      are      administered              as
                                                        - 1 -

   injection          preparations        and      frequent         administration              is
   necessary        for    the   maintenance         of    the    blood     level       of     the
   physiologically           active peptides,          thus     causing a       severe pain
   for    the    patients.        To    solve     these      problems,       many       efforts
 5 have been made to increase the stability of peptide drugs in
   blood and to maintain             the drugs        in    the blood at         high level
   for     a    prolonged      period      of    time,       thereby      maximizing           the
   pharmaceutical efficacy of the drugs.
             In   particular,       the    long-acting          preparations          of      such
10 peptide       drugs     therefore      need     to     increase      their       stability
   while         simultaneously           maintaining             their        titers           at
   sufficiently          high      levels        without        causing        any       immune
   responses         in  patients.          In    this     regard,      as     methods         for
   stabilizing the           peptides,     and inhibiting the              degradation by
15 a    proteolytic        enzyme,      attempts       have     been    made      to     modify
   specific         amino     acid     sequences         which      are     sensitive           to
   proteolytic enzymes.
            For    example,     GLP-l     (7-37     or    7-36    amide),      which       has   a
   therapeutic         effect    of   lowering the          blood     glucose      level       for
20 treating       type    2   diabetes,      has    a    short     physiological            half
   life     of about      4 minutes      or    less,    due    to   loss    of   the     titers
   of    GLP-l     through     the    cleavage       between       the    8th    amino        acid
    (Ala) and the 9th amino acid                 (Asp) by a dipeptidyl peptidase
   IV    (DPP    IV) .     In  this    regard,       GLP-1     derivatives,          in    which
25 Ala8    is   substituted with         Gly,     Leu,     or   D-Ala    to   increase         the

   resistance            to    DPP       IV      while          maintaining                the        physiological
   activity,           have       been        developed.                  Moreover,               the        N-terminal
   amino       acid of       GLP-1,        His 7 ,     is     critical           for      the        GLP-1 activity,
   and      serves        as    a    target          for        DPP      IV.         Accordingly,                   the      N
 5 terminus        is     modified to              an      alkyl or            acyl       group,           and His-          is
   subjected to N-methylation or alpha-methylation, to increase
   its     resistance          to DPP          IV,      and to maintain                     its       physiological
   activity.            Although          it     was      confirmed             that       the        stability            was
   improved        due       to    an     increase             in     their        resistance                 to     DPP     IV
10 there       was     also      a   report          that         the      receptor             affinity             of    the
   derivatives              obtained           by       modifying               His         was         considerably
   reduced        and      the     secretory              capacity            of     cAMP         was       reduced          at
   the      same      concentration                 (see,          Gallwitz            et       al.,         Regulatory

              In  addition,           among         the       insulinotropic peptides                              such      as

   instead of His-Ala,                   which is a sequence of GLP-1                                      acting as a
   substrate         for      DDP    IV.        Accordingly,                 exendin-4 has                    resistance
20 to     DPP    IV      and     higher          physiological                  activity              than        that       of
   GLP-1.        Thus,        exendin-4            has      a     longer        in-vivo             half-life            than

   native       exendin-4     (exenatide:          Byetta)      was    used     as   a  control.
10 Exendin-4 derivatives with a modified N-terminal                                 charge were
   synthesized        by American         Peptide        Corporation,         and    the    native
   exendin-4 was obtained from Amylin Pharmaceuticals.
            The   GLP-1    receptor was          expressed from CHO-DG44                cells      in

   with        a    modified       N-terminal              charge      were        diluted         by

   coupling/dissociation can                    occur repeatedly between                      the     GLP-1

            These pharmacokinetic                 changes        in the        GLP-1 receptor           can

   by     the   receptor        and      make       desensitization                 less     likely       to
