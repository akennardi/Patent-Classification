EMULSIFIABLE CONCENTRATE
Technical Field
This invention relates to multi-active herbicides formulations in the form of an
emulsifiable concentrate (EC). In particular this invention relates to emulsifiable
concentrate formulations that contain prosulfocarb and that also contain trifluralin.
More particularly the invention relates to emulsifiable concentrate formulations
wherein the cumulative herbicide loading (prosulfocarb plus trifluralin) is at least
500 g/L, preferably at least 700 g/L.
Background Art
Prosulfocarb (also     known    as S-Benzyl    dipropylthiocarbamate,    and as S
(phenylmethyl)dipropylcarbamothioate)       is  in the   thiocarbamate    family   of
herbicides    (Group    J,  see  http/www.croplife.org.au/resistance-strategy/2015
herbicide-resistance-mangement-strategies/#mode     of action/) and has a mode of
action based on the inhibition of lipid synthesis. Prosulfocarb is root-absorbed
(below the seed), and when the root system of the weed extends beyond the
prosulfocarb zone, the weed can survive. Technical grade prosulfocarb material
has a melting point of approximately -20'C and a solubility in water of 13 mg/L at
20'C Up-take of Prosulfocarb by a plant is assisted by soil moisture.
Trifluralin (also known as 2,6-Dinitro-N,N-dipropyl-4-(trifluoromethy)aniline is a
pre-emergence herbicide in the dinitroaniline family of herbicides (Group D). It is
applied to soil to control annual grass (such as annual ryegrass) and broadleaf
weeds. It acts by inhibiting root development, and can kill weeds as they
germinate. Technical trifluralin melts at 46-47 'C and is highly insoluble in water.
It is a volatile herbicide and may be incorporated into top-soil to reduce volatile
loss.
The use of prosulfocarb and trifluralin in combination can be advantageous in the
following agronomic scenarios: (i) to manage the control of herbicide-resistant
weeds such as herbicide-resistant annual ryegrass, (ii) to achieve a broader
spectrum of weed control, for example to enable control of wire-grass which may
                                          1

be difficult to control with prosulfocarb alone, and (iii) to provide a less
phytotoxic     alternative    to other herbicide    combinations  (e.g. prosulfocarb
metolachlor combinations).
Tank mixes of prosulfocarb and trifluralin have been proposed. For example the
tank mixing of BOXER GOLD (a combination product with prosulfocarb and
metolachlor) with trifluralin has been proposed for (i) extending weed-control
spectrum, (ii) on sandy soils where moisture is limiting, and (iii) where herbicide
movement into the seeding zone poses a crop safety risk (see label for Boxer Gold
by Syngenta).
WO 2013083372 teaches that emulsifiable concentrates with better cold-storage
characteristics may be obtained by including DMSO and benzyl alcohol in the
formulation. The ECs contain a pesticide selected from the group of the
fungicides,     insecticides,    nematicides,   herbicides, safeners   and/or   growth
regulators. Among the many herbicides recited individually are prosulfocarb and
trifluralin, but there is no teaching that trifluralin and prosulfocarb should be co
formulated in a one-pack EC formulation.
US 6,413,908 describes compositions containing dispersed phase agrochemicals,
particularly phytoactives,       such as growth regulators and/or herbicides, or
pesticides, such as insecticides, fungicides, or acaricides, characterised in that they
include as adjuvant a branched primary alcohol alkoxylate. In an embodiment the
dispersed phase agrochemical is one or more of acetochlor, alachlor, nicosulfuron,
primisulfuron, prosulfocarb, trifluralin, fenitrothion, propargite, iprodione and
propiconazole, however there is no teaching that prosulfocarb and trifluralin
should be co-formulated in a one-pack EC formulation.
If a farmer wants to apply both prosulfocarb and trifluralin to a field through a
multi-nozzle spray rig, that farmer may separately add a single-active emulsifiable
concentrate of prosulfocarb and a single-active emulsifiable concentrate of
trifluralin to the spray water tank of his spray rig (this is called tank mixing).
Disadvantages of tank-mix methodology include:
      The requirement to transport and handle twice as many containers
                                              2

.     The requirement to safely dispose of twice as many empty containers
.     The capacity to make a mistake in the mixing ratio (this is particularly
problematic when farm labourers are not well-educated)
.     The need for label instructions to be more complex, and to be co-ordinated
between 2 separate containers
o     The need to have more carrier solvents and emulsifiers than are required in a
one-pack formulation
.     Lower emulsion quality where actives are introduced into the spray water
tank via separate formulations as opposed to the jointly optimised emulsion of a
combined actives formulation.
The use of a one-pack highly-loaded EC formulation containing both
prosulfocarb and trifluralin would avoid the disadvantages itemised above.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
In a first aspect the invention relates to an emulsifiable concentrate co-formulation
of prosulfocarb and trifluralin which forms a stable emulsion when mixed with an
excess of water. Further to this, the sum of concentrations of prosulfocarb and
trifluralin in the emulsifiable concentrate formulation is preferably greater than
600 g/L. In particular embodiments, the emulsifiable concentrate has an herbicidal
component consisting of prosulfocarb and trifluralin in a weight ratio in the range
5:1 to 1:1 and a non-herbicidal component comprising at least one agriculturally
acceptable solid, liquid or liquid-containing surfactant, wherein the weight ratio of
the herbicidal component to the non-herbicidal component is at least 3:1.
It will be well understood that the term "emulsifiable concentrate formulation" or
"emulsifiable concentrate" (EC) refers to a liquid formulation or concentrate of an
active agent, such as a pesticide, which, on dilution in water or a water-containing
liquid, form an emulsion such as a spontaneous milky white emulsion comprising
a dispersed water immiscible phase. The term "emulsion", as used herein, refers to
a fine dispersion of minute droplets of one liquid in another in which it is not
soluble or miscible and includes microemulsions and macroemulsions.
In an embodiment the weight ratio of the herbicidal component to the non
herbicidal component is at least 4:1. In an embodiment the weight ratio of the
herbicidal component to the non-herbicidal component is at least 5:1. In an
embodiment the weight ratio of the herbicidal component to the non-herbicidal
component is at least 6:1. In an embodiment the weight ratio of the herbicidal
component to the non-herbicidal component is at least 8:1. In an embodiment the
                                            6

weight ratio of the herbicidal component to the non-herbicidal component is at
least 10:1.

g/L, about 150 g/L and about 350 g/L, about 200 g/L and about 300 g/L, or any
range therein. In particular embodiments of the present invention, trifluralin is
present in an amount of about 100, 110, 120, 130, 140, 150, 160, 170, 180, 190,
200, 210, 220, 230, 240, 250, 260, 270, 280, 290, 300, 310, 320, 330, 340, 350,
360, 370, 380, 390, 400 g/L or any range therein. In certain embodiments of the
present invention, trifluralin is present in an amount of between about 100 g/L and
about 400 g/L. In one preferred embodiment, trifluralin is present in an amount of
between about 200 g/L and about 300 g/L.
Suitably, the sum of concentrations of prosulfocarb and trifluralin in the
emulsifiable concentrate formulation is greater than 600 g/L. Accordingly,
prosulfocarb and trifluralin may be present in a combined amount or concentration
of between about 600 g/L and about 950 g/L, about 700 g/L and about 925 g/L,
                                            7

about 800 g/L and about 900 g/L, or any range therein. In particular embodiments
of the present invention, prosulfocarb and trifluralin are present in a combined
amount or concentration of about 600, 610, 620, 630, 640, 650, 660, 670, 680,
690, 700, 710, 720, 730, 740, 750, 760, 770, 780, 790, 800, 810, 820, 830, 840,
850, 860, 870, 880, 890, 900, 910, 920, 930, 940, 950 g/L or any range therein. In
certain embodiments of the present invention, prosulfocarb and trifluralin are
present in a combined amount or concentration of between about 800 g/L and
about 950 g/L. In one preferred embodiment, prosulfocarb and trifluralin are
present in a combined amount or concentration of between about 825 g/L and
about 925 g/L.
As used herein, the term "surfactant" or "surface-active agent" refers to an agent,
usually an organic chemical compound that is at least partially amphiphilic (i.e.,
typically containing a hydrophobic tail group and hydrophilic polar head group).
Given their structure, surfactants are generally capable of lowering the surface
tension (or interfacial tension) between two liquids or between a liquid and a solid.
Further to this, these properties typically allow solubility of the surfactant in
organic solvents as well as in water, and allow the surfactant to promote
solubilization or at least dispersal of fatty/waxy materials in water and water
containing solutions. In this regard, a surfactant may act as a detergent, a wetting
agent, an emulsifying agent, a foaming agent and/or a dispersing agent.
The surfactant, including one or a plurality of surfactants (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 etc
surfactants), are suitably present in a high enough concentration that allows for the
production    of a    highly   loaded    emulsifiable    concentrate    formulation  of
prosulfocarb and trifluralin. In this regard, it will be apparent that an amount of the
surfactant of the emulsifiable concentrate formulation can vary, for example,
depending on the particular concentrations of prosulfocarb and trifluralin and/or
the particular surfactant to be included therein.
Suitably, the surfactant is present in an amount of at least 5 g/L. Accordingly, the
surfactant of the present invention may be present in an amount of between about
5 g/L and about 200 g/L, about 25 g/L and about 120 g/L, about 40 g/L and about
100 g/L, or any range therein. In particular embodiments of the present invention,
                                            8

the surface active agent is present in an amount of about 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12,

certain embodiments of the present invention, the surfactant is present in an
amount of between about 35 g/L and about 100 g/L. In one preferred embodiment,
the surfactant is present in an amount of between about 40 g/L and about 80 g/L.
In an embodiment the at least one agriculturally acceptable solid, liquid or liquid
containing surfactant is selected from the group consisting of non-ionic, anionic,
cationic, zwitterionic and cation-anion composite surfactants.
In an embodiment the agriculturally acceptable solid, liquid or liquid-containing

HLB     within   2 HLB     units   of 17.5,   polypropyleneglycol(with   30-40P0)

09-5 HLB       13), nonylphenol alkoxylate and castor oil ethoxylates. In an
embodiment the material sold as Termul 203 (and described by Huntsman as an
alcohol alkoxylate), the material sold as Termul 3150 (and described by Huntsman
as ethoxylated tristyryl phenol), the material sold as Termul 200 (and described by

described by Huntsman as castor oil ethoxylate) or the materials sold as Teric N8
-  N15 (and described by Huntsman as nonyl phenol ethoxylates) is used.
In an embodiment the non-ionic surfactant is present at 20-70g/L in the
emulsifiable concentrate formulation. In an embodiment the non-ionic surfactant
is present at 30-50g/L in the emulsifiable concentrate formulation. In an
embodiment the non-ionic surfactant is present at 34-42g/L in the emulsifiable
concentrate formulation.
In an embodiment the at least one agriculturally acceptable solid, liquid or liquid
containing surfactant comprises an anionic surfactant selected from the group
consisting of alkyl or aryl or alkylaryl or alkylether sulfates, alkyl or aryl or
alkylaryl sulfonates, alkyl or aryl or alkylaryl phosphate esters, alkyl or aryl or
alkylaryl ether phosphates, alkyl carboxylates and sarcosinates, carboxylated
alkylphenols, carboxylated alcohol derivatives (including carboxylated glycol
derivatives) sulfates and sulfonates of alkoxylated moieties, sulfonates of
naphthalene or alkylnaphthalene or petroleum and the like. The alkyl moieties can
be linear or branched, or saturated or unsaturated. The aryl moieties may be
naphthalene or alkylnaphthalene moieties.
It will be apparent in light of the foregoing that one or more surfactants may be
                                          10

introduced into the formulation of the invention as a soluble concentration in a
further solvent (e.g., calcium dodecylbenzene sulfonate in ethyl hexanol) and the
latter may equate, for example, to amounts up to about 10 g/L to about 25 g/L or
more of the formulation. Given the above, it will be appreciated that such amounts
of the further solvent may make little or no contribution to the solvency of
prosulfocarb and/or trifluralin within the formulation of the invention.
Accordingly, in an embodiment the anionic surfactant is selected from the group
consisting of calcium alkylbenzene sulfonate salt in a liquid solvent carrier such as
2-ethyl-hexanol, wherein the alkyl moiety, which may be straight or branched is
C8-C14 alkyl. In an embodiment the alkyl moiety is C1O-C12 alkyl. In an
embodiment the anionic surfactant is present as a 40-70% solution in carrier
solvent. In an embodiment the anionic surfactant is present as a     5 0 -6 0 % solution
in carrier solvent.
In an embodiment the anionic surfactant is present in the range of about 20 g/L to

other deterrents and the like, as are known in the art, can also be added where
desired to modify the properties of the emulsifiable concentrate formulation as
required.
It will be understood that it is desirable for the emulsifiable concentrate provided
herein to be readily or easily pumped or poured from a storage vessel. Preferably,
the emulsifiable concentrate formulation has a viscosity at room temperature (i.e.,
20'C) of no more than 2000 cPs (e.g., 1, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 100, 200, 300, 400,
500, 600, 700, 800, 900, 1000, 1100, 1200, 1300, 1400, 1500, 1600, 1700, 1800,
1900, 2000 cPs and any range therein), as viscosities above this typically make it
difficult or impractical to pump or pour the formulation. Preferably, the
                                           15

emulsifiable concentrate formulation of the invention has a viscosity at room
temperature of about or less than 400 cPs.
In a still further aspect of the invention there is provided a method of preparing an
emulsifiable concentrate formulation of prosulfocarb and trifluralin. The method
includes the steps of:
adding prosulfocarb to a clean empty formulation vessel;
adding trifluralin to the formulation vessel;
adding at least one agriculturally acceptable surfactant and, optionally, at least one
agriculturally acceptable organic solvent to the formulation vessel; and
agitating to uniformity.
In an embodiment an agriculturally acceptable organic solvent is added to the
formulation vessel.
In an embodiment the method also includes the step of clearing residual surfactant
from pumps or process lines with an agriculturally acceptable solvent. In an
embodiment       an agriculturally acceptable     organic  solvent is added to the
formulation vessel and residual surfactant is cleared from pumps or process lines
with the same agriculturally acceptable solvent.
In an embodiment preparation of the emulsifiable concentrate takes place at a
temperature of > 30'C. In an embodiment the preparation takes place at a
temperature between 30'C and 60 'C.
In an embodiment the vessel is agitated for at least 30 minutes after addition of the
last ingredient.
With respect to present aspect of preparing             an emulsifiable   concentrate
formulation, it will be appreciated that this method may be performed using
commercially available equipment, such as formulation vessels and the like,
known in the art.
In another aspect, the invention provides an emulsifiable concentrate formulation
prepared by the method of the aforementioned aspect.
                                            16

In a further aspect the invention relates to a stable emulsion produced by mixing
an emulsifiable concentrate        co-formulation of prosulfocarb     and trifluralin
according to the first aspect of the present invention with an excess of water.
Stability is established by adding 5mL of the emulsifiable concentrate to 95mL of
water at room temperature in a measuring cylinder and inverting the cylinder 5
times. The emulsion is stable if no more 1 mL of oil and no more than 3 mL of
cream form after standing for 30 minutes.
In an embodiment the contents of the measuring cylinder should re-emulsify after
standing for 24 hrs when the measuring cylinder is inverted 5 times.
In an embodiment less than 60 mL of foam is observed after 1 minute when a 200
mL emulsion contained in a container is inverted is inverted 30 times.
In an embodiment the pH of the formulation is in the range of 4 to 10. In an
embodiment the pH of the formulation is in the range of 6 to 9.
In an embodiment specific gravity for the formulation is in the range of 1.00 to
1.300. In an embodiment specific gravity for the formulation is in the range of
1.030 to 1.130. In an embodiment specific gravity for the formulation is in the
range of 1.060 to 1.110
In an embodiment the viscosity of the formulation at 20 'C is 1 to 2000 cPs. In an
embodiment the viscosity of the formulation at 20 'C is 10 to 500 cPs. In an
embodiment the viscosity of the formulation at 20 'C is <200 cPs such as 50 to
200 cPs.
In an embodiment the viscosity of the formulation at 5 'C is 1 to 2000 cPs. In an
embodiment the viscosity of the formulation at 5 'C is 10 to 1000 cPs. In an
embodiment the viscosity of the formulation at 5oC is <1000 cPs, such as 20 to
1000 cPs. In an embodiment the viscosity of the formulation at 5 'C is <400 cPs,
such as 50 to 400 cPs.
                                           17

It is desirable for the emulsifiable concentrate to be easily pumped or poured.
Viscosities of beyond 2000cPs represent a practical upper limit beyond which it is
difficult to pump or pour the formulation. A more desirable viscosity is less than
400 cPs.
The present invention also relates to a method of controlling weeds in a target crop
by application, prior to crop emergence, of a diluted emulsifiable concentrate co
formulation of the herbicides prosulfocarb and trifluralin according to the first
aspect of the present invention.
In an embodiment the application rate is (based on volume of the emulsifiable
concentrate) is in the range 1-8 L/ha. In an embodiment the application rate is 2
5L/ha. In an embodiment the application rate is about 3L/ha.
The ratios described above, such as the ratio of herbicide components
(prosulfocarb plus trifluralin) to non-herbicidal components, the ratio of herbicide
components (prosulfocarb plus trifluralin) to solvent, and the ratio of herbicide
components (prosulfocarb plus trifluralin) to solubilising moiety, are important
quality parameters for an EC formulation as the ratios affect:
1.    The quantity of solvent released to the environment as a consequence of
applying a given amount of herbicide to a cultivation zone;
2.    The amount of high-quality packing material that is utilised in carrying a
given amount of herbicide to a cultivation zone;
3.    The amount of used packaging material that needs to be recycled or
otherwise disposed of after applying a given amount of herbicide to a cultivation
zone;
4.    The contact toxicity of the EC formulation;
5.    The flammability of the EC formulation.
Formulations according to the present invention are advantageous as the ratio of
herbicidal components to non-herbicidal components is relatively high compared
to a formulation that would result if a prosulfocarb EC and a trifluralin EC are
individually added to a spray tank. Furthermore, the ratio of herbicidal
                                          18

components to organic solvent is relatively high.
The non-herbicidal component includes a solubilising moiety for the combination
of prosulfocarb and trifluralin which comprises liquid systems that include
agriculturally    acceptable    solvents,  and  also liquid   systems   that  include
agriculturally acceptable liquid, or liquid-containing surfactants, provided that
both prosulfocarb and trifluralin (in combination) dissolve in that liquid system. A
solubilising moiety for the combination of prosulfocarb and trifluralin may contain
one, two or more liquid components, being components that are liquid at 20 'C,
which constitute the       solubilising   moiety system    for the combination     of
prosulfocarb     and trifluralin. The weight of a solubilising moiety for the
combination of prosulfocarb and trifluralin is taken to be the sum of the weights of
liquid components, being the components that are liquid at 20 'C, which constitute
the solubilising moiety system for the combination of prosulfocarb and trifluralin.
For the avoidance of doubt, if a solubilising moiety for the combination of
prosulfocarb and trifluralin happens to include one or more solubilised solids (e.g.
a solid dissolved surfactant), the weight of the solubilising moiety for the
combination of prosulfocarb and trifluralin is taken to be the sum of the weights of
the liquid components of the solvent system for the combination of prosulfocarb
and trifluralin, but does not include the weights of non-prosulfocarb, non
trifluralin solid components that may be dissolved. For the avoidance of doubt, the
solubilising system does not include herbicidal components, even if they are in
liquid form.
In an embodiment the ratio of total herbicide to solubilising moiety is more than
5:1. In an embodiment the ratio of total herbicide to solubilising moiety is more
than 8:1. In an embodiment the ratio of total herbicide to solubilising moiety is
more than 10:1. In an embodiment the ratio of total herbicide to solubilising
moiety is more than 12:1.
The term "agriculturally acceptable" means registered or otherwise approved for
use in agriculture in at least one country.
In the claims which follow and in the preceding description of the invention,
                                            19

except where the context requires otherwise due to express language or necessary
implication, the word         "comprise"   or variations   such as "comprises"       or
"comprising" is used in an inclusive sense, i.e. to specify the presence of the stated
features but not to preclude the presence or addition of further features in various
embodiments of the invention.
It will be appreciated that the indefinite articles "a" and "an" are not to be read as
singular indefinite articles or as otherwise excluding more than one or more than a
single subject to which the indefinite article refers. For example, "a" surfactant
includes one surfactant, one or more surfactants and a plurality of surfactants.

The trial was established as a randomised complete block design with 7 treatments
and 3 replicates. Plot size was 10 metres by 2 metres.
The pest species present at the trial site was annual ryegrass (Lolium rigidum). The
trial commenced in a bare fallow paddock with 20% standing lupin stubble load.
Detailed assessments were conducted at 27, 47, 60 and 136 days after treatment
(DAT). These included crop emergence counts, weed counts and weed panicle
counts.
Weed counts - Count the number of annual ryegrass plants per plot from 3
randomly thrown 1xim quadrats. Present as the number of weeds per m 2
Crop emergence counts - count the number of emerged wheat plants of 3
randomly selected meters of row. Present as emerged seedlings per meter of row.
Weed panicle counts - count the number of annual ryegrass panicles (seed heads)
per plot from 3 randomly thrown 1xim quadrats. Present as the number of
panicles per m.
Statistical analyses were conducted using Microsoft Excel 2010, utilising the
DSAASTAT ver. 1.101 plugin.
The model includes all treatment effects.
Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used for the analysis of treatment effects on
non-transformed data with least significant difference (LSD) procedures used for
means comparisons.
