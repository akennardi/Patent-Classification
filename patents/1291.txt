                                             MACROCYCLES
                                BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
[0001] The human transcription factor protein p53 induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in response to
       DNA damage and cellular stress, and thereby plays a critical role in protecting cells from
       malignant transformation. The E3 ubiquitin ligase MDM2 (also known as HDM2) negatively
       regulates p53 function through a direct binding interaction that neutralizes the p53 transactivation
       activity, leads to export from the nucleus of p53 protein, and targets p53 for degradation via the
       ubiquitylation-proteasomal pathway. Loss of p53 activity, either by deletion, mutation, or MDM2
       overexpression, is the most common defect in human cancers. Tumors that express wild type p53
       are vulnerable to pharmacologic agents that stabilize or increase the concentration of active p53.
       In this context, inhibition of the activities of MDM2 has emerged as a validated approach to
       restore p53 activity and resensitize cancer cells to apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. MDMX
       (MDM4) has more recently been identified as a similar negative regulator of p53, and studies
       have revealed significant structural homology between the p53 binding interfaces of MDM2 and
       MDMX. The p53-MDM2 and p53-MDMX protein-protein interactions are mediated by the same
        15-residue alpha-helical transactivation domain of p53, which inserts into hydrophobic clefts on
       the surface of MDM2 and MDMX. Three residues within this domain of p53 (F19, W23, and
       L26) are essential for binding to MDM2 and MDMX.
[0002] There remains a considerable need for compounds capable of binding to and modulating the
       activity of p53, MDM2 and/or MDMX. Provided herein are p53-based peptidomimetic
       macrocycles that modulate an activity of p53. Also provided herein are p53-based
       peptidomimetic macrocycles that inhibit the interactions between p53, MDM2 and/or MDMX
       proteins. Further, provided herein are p53-based peptidomimetic macrocycles that can be used for
       treating diseases including but not limited to cancer and other hyperproliferative diseases.
                                   SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
[0003] Described herein are stably cross-linked peptides related to a portion of human p53 ("p5 3
       peptidomimetic macrocycles"). These cross-linked peptides contain at least two modified amino
       acids that together form an intramolecular cross-link that can help to stabilize the alpha-helical
       secondary structure of a portion of p53 that is thought to be important for binding of p53 to
       MDM2 and for binding of p53 to MDMX. Accordingly, a cross-linked polypeptide described
       herein can have improved biological activity relative to a corresponding polypeptide that is not
       cross-linked. The p53 peptidomimetic macrocycles are thought to interfere with binding of p53 to
       MDM2 and/or of p53 to MDMX, thereby liberating functional p53 and inhibiting its destruction.
       The p53 peptidomimetic macrocycles described herein can be used therapeutically, for example
                                                       -1-

 WO 2013/123267                                                                    PCT/US2013/026241
       to treat cancers and other disorders characterized by an undesirably low level or a low activity of
       p53, and/or to treat cancers and other disorders characterized by an undesirably high level of
       activity of MDM2 or MDMIX. The p53 peptidomimetic macrocycles can also be useful for
       treatment of any disorder associated with disrupted regulation of the p53 transcriptional pathway,
       leading to conditions of excess cell survival and proliferation such as cancer and autoimmunity,
       in addition to conditions of inappropriate cell cycle arrest and apoptosis such as
       neurodegeneration and immunedeficiencies. In some embodiments, the p53 peptidomimetic
       macrocycles bind to MDM2 (e.g., GenBank@ Accession No.: 228952; GI:228952) and/or
       MDMX (also referred to as MDM4; GenBank@ AccessionNo.: 88702791; GI:88702791).
[0004] In one aspect, provided herein is a peptidomimetic macrocycle comprising an amino acid
       sequence which is at least about 60%, 80%, 90%, or 95% identical to an amino acid sequence
       chosen from the group consisting of the amino acid sequences in Table 4, Table 4a, Table 4b, or
       Table 5. In some embodiments, the peptidomimetic macrocycle is not a peptide as shown in
       Table 6, Table 6a, Table 7, Table 7a, or Table 7b. In some embodiments, the peptidomimetic
       macrocycle has an amino acid sequence chosen from Table 4. In some embodiments, the
       peptidomimetic macrocycle has an amino acid sequence chosen from Table 4a. In some
       embodiments, the peptidomimetic macrocycle has an amino acid sequence chosen from Table 4b.
       In some embodiments, the peptidomimetic macrocycle has an amino acid sequence chosen from
       Table 5.
[0005] Alternatively, an amino acid sequence of said peptidomimetic macrocycle is chosen as above, and
       further wherein the macrocycle does not include an all carbon crosslink or a triazole. In some
       embodiments, the peptidomimetic macrocycle comprises a helix, such as an a-helix. In other
       embodiments, the peptidomimetic macrocycle comprises an a,a-disubstituted amino acid. A
       peptidomimetic macrocycle can comprise a crosslinker linking the a-positions of at least two
       amino acids. At least one of said two amino acids can be an a,a-disubstituted amino acid.

         E do not comprise a positively charged side chain or a polar uncharged side chain. In some
         embodiments, when u = 1 and w= 2, the first C-terminal amino acid and/or the second C-terminal

                         DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
[0031] As used herein, the term "macrocycle" refers to a molecule having a chemical structure including
       a ring or cycle formed by at least 9 covalently bonded atoms.
[0032] As used herein, the term "peptidomimetic macrocycle" or "crosslinked polypeptide" refers to a
       compound comprising a plurality of amino acid residues joined by a plurality of peptide bonds
       and at least one macrocycle-forming linker which forms a macrocycle between a first naturally
                                                     -15-

 WO 2013/123267                                                                    PCT/US2013/026241
       occurring or non-naturally-occurring amino acid residue (or analog) and a second naturally
       occurring or non-naturally-occurring amino acid residue (or analog) within the same molecule.
       Peptidomimetic macrocycle include embodiments where the macrocycle-forming linker connects
       the a carbon of the first amino acid residue (or analog) to the a carbon of the second amino acid
       residue (or analog). The peptidomimetic macrocycles optionally include one or more non-peptide
       bonds between one or more amino acid residues and/or amino acid analog residues, and
       optionally include one or more non-naturally-occurring amino acid residues or amino acid analog
       residues in addition to any which form the macrocycle. A "corresponding uncrosslinked
       polypeptide" when referred to in the context of a peptidomimetic macrocycle is understood to
       relate to a polypeptide of the same length as the macrocycle and comprising the equivalent
       natural amino acids of the wild-type sequence corresponding to the macrocycle.
[0033] As used herein, the term "stability" refers to the maintenance of a defined secondary structure in
       solution by a peptidomimetic macrocycle as measured by circular dichroism, NMR or another
       biophysical measure, or resistance to proteolytic degradation in vitro or in vivo. Non-limiting
       examples of secondary structures contemplated herein are a-helices, 310 helices,    p-turns, and f
       pleated sheets.
[0034] As used herein, the term "helical stability" refers to the maintenance of a helical structure by a
       peptidomimetic macrocycle as measured by circular dichroism or NMR. For example, in some
       embodiments, a peptidomimetic macrocycle exhibits at least a 1.25, 1.5, 1.75 or 2-fold increase in
       a-helicity as determined by circular dichroism compared to a corresponding uncrosslinked
       macrocycle.
[0035] The term "amino acid" refers to a molecule containing both an amino group and a carboxyl
       group. Suitable amino acids include, without limitation, both the D-and L-isomers of the
       naturally-occurring amino acids, as well as non-naturally occurring amino acids prepared by
       organic synthesis or other metabolic routes. The term amino acid, as used herein, includes
       without limitation a-amino acids, natural amino acids, non-natural amino acids, and amino acid
       analogs.
[0036] The term "a-amino acid" refers to a molecule containing both an amino group and a carboxyl
       group bound to a carbon which is designated the a-carbon.
[0037] The term "p-amino acid" refers to a molecule containing both an amino group and a carboxyl
       group in a Q configuration.
[0038] The term "naturally occurring amino acid" refers to any one of the twenty amino acids commonly
       found in peptides synthesized in nature, and known by the one letter abbreviations A, R, N, C, D,
       Q, E, G, H, I, L, K, M, F, P,  S, T, W, Y and V.

[0052] In some embodiments, amino acid analogs are racemic. In some embodiments, the D isomer of
       the amino acid analog is used. In some embodiments, the L isomer of the amino acid analog is
       used. In other embodiments, the amino acid analog comprises chiral centers that are in the R or S
       configuration. In still other embodiments, the amino group(s) of a P-amino acid analog is
       substituted with a protecting group, e.g., tert-butyloxycarbonyl (BOC group), 9
       fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl (FMOC), tosyl, and the like. In yet other embodiments, the

         In some embodiments the salt of the amino acid analog is used.
[0053]   A "non-essential" amino acid residue, as used herein, is an amino acid residue present in a wild
         type sequence of a polypeptide that can be altered without abolishing or substantially altering
         essential biological or biochemical activity (e.g., receptor binding or activation) of the
         polypeptide.
[0054]   An "essential" amino acid residue, as used herein, is an amino acid residue present in a wild-type
         sequence of a polypeptide that, when altered, results in abolishing or a substantial reduction in the
         polypeptide's essential biological or biochemical activity(e.g., receptor binding or activation).
[0055]   A "conservative amino acid substitution" is one in which an amino acid residue is replaced with a
         different amino acid residue having a similar side chain. Families of amino acid residues having
         similar side chains have been defined in the art. These families include amino acids with basic
         side chains (e.g., K, R, H), acidic side chains (e.g., D, E), uncharged polar side chains (e.g., G, N,
         Q, S,  T, Y, C), nonpolar side chains (e.g., A, V, L, I, P, F, M, W), beta-branched side chains (e.g.,
         T, V, I) and aromatic side chains (e.g., Y, F, W, H). Thus, a predicted nonessential amino acid
         residue in a polypeptide, for example, is replaced with another amino acid residue from the same
         side chain family. Other examples of acceptable substitutions are substitutions based on isosteric
         considerations (e.g. norleucine for methionine) or other properties (e.g. 2-thienylalanine for
         phenylalanine, or 6-Cl-tryptophan for tryptophan).
[0056]   The term "capping group" refers to the chemical moiety occurring at either the carboxy or amino
         terminus of the polypeptide chain of the subject peptidomimetic macrocycle. The capping group
         of a carboxy terminus includes an unmodified carboxylic acid (ie -COOH) or a carboxylic acid
         with a substituent. For example, the carboxy terminus can be substituted with an amino group to
         yield a carboxamide at the C-terminus. Various substituents include but are not limited to primary
         and secondary amines, including pegylated secondary amines. Representative secondary amine
         capping groups for the C-terminus include:

[0058] The term "member" as used herein in conjunction with macrocycles or macrocycle-forming
       linkers refers to the atoms that form or can form the macrocycle, and excludes substituent or side
       chain atoms. By analogy, cyclodecane, 1,2-difluoro-decane and 1,3-dimethyl cyclodecane are all
       considered ten-membered macrocycles as the hydrogen or fluoro substituents or methyl side
       chains do not participate in forming the macrocycle.
[0059] The symbol "/"       when used as part of a molecular structure refers to a single bond or a trans or
       cis double bond.
[0060] The term "amino acid side chain" refers to a moiety attached to the a-carbon (or another
       backbone atom) in an amino acid. For example, the amino acid side chain for alanine is methyl,
       the amino acid side chain for phenylalanine is phenylmethyl, the amino acid side chain for
       cysteine is thiomethyl, the amino acid side chain for aspartate is carboxymethyl, the amino acid
       side chain for tyrosine is 4-hydroxyphenylmethyl, etc. Other non-naturally occurring amino acid
       side chains are also included, for example, those that occur in nature (e.g., an amino acid
       metabolite) or those that are made synthetically (e.g., an a,a di-substituted amino acid).
[0061] The term "a,a di-substituted amino" acid refers to a molecule or moiety containing both an amino
       group and a carboxyl group bound to a carbon (the a-carbon) that is attached to two natural or
       non-natural amino acid side chains.
[0062] The term "polypeptide" encompasses two or more naturally or non-naturally-occurring amino
       acids joined by a covalent bond (e.g., an amide bond). Polypeptides as described herein include
       full length proteins (e.g., fully processed proteins) as well as shorter amino acid sequences (e.g.,
       fragments of naturally-occurring proteins or synthetic polypeptide fragments).
[0063] The term "macrocyclization reagent" or "macrocycle-forming reagent" as used herein refers to
       any reagent which can be used to prepare a peptidomimetic macrocycle by mediating the reaction
       between two reactive groups. Reactive groups can be, for example, an azide and alkyne, in which
       case macrocyclization reagents include, without limitation, Cu reagents such as reagents which
       provide a reactive Cu(I) species, such as CuBr, Cul or CuOTf, as well as Cu(II) salts such as
       Cu(CO 2CH 3)2 , CuSO 4 , and CuCl 2 that can be converted in situ to an active Cu(I) reagent by the
       addition of a reducing agent such as ascorbic acid or sodium ascorbate. Macrocyclization
       reagents can additionally include, for example, Ru reagents known in the art such as
       Cp*RuCl(PPh 3)2 , [Cp*RuCl]     4 or other Ru reagents which can provide a reactive Ru(II) species.
       In other cases, the reactive groups are terminal olefins. In such embodiments, the
       macrocyclization reagents or macrocycle-forming reagents are metathesis catalysts including, but
       not limited to, stabilized, late transition metal carbene complex catalysts such as Group VIII
       transition metal carbene catalysts. For example, such catalysts are Ru and Os metal centers
       having a +2 oxidation state, an electron count of 16 and pentacoordinated. In other examples,
       catalysts have W or Mo centers. Various catalysts are disclosed in Grubbs et al., "Ring Closing
       Metathesis and Related Processes in Organic Synthesis" Ace. Chem. Res. 1995, 28, 446-452,

       groups are thiol groups. In such embodiments, the macrocyclization reagent is, for example, a
       linker functionalized with two thiol-reactive groups such as halogen groups.
[0064] The term "halo" or "halogen" refers to fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine or a radical thereof.
[0065] The term "alkyl" refers to a hydrocarbon chain that is a straight chain or branched chain,
       containing the indicated number of carbon atoms. For example, C1 -Ca indicates that the group
       has from 1 to 10 (inclusive) carbon atoms in it. In the absence of any numerical designation,
       "alkyl" is a chain (straight or branched) having I to 20 (inclusive) carbon atoms in it.

       carbon atoms in it.
[0068] The term "alkynyl" refers to a hydrocarbon chain that is a straight chain or branched chain having
       one or more carbon-carbon triple bonds. The alkynyl moiety contains the indicated number of
       carbon atoms. For example, C 2-Cio indicates that the group has from 2 to 10 (inclusive) carbon
       atoms in it. The term "lower alkynyl" refers to a C 2-C6 alkynyl chain. In the absence of any

[0082] In some embodiments, one or more compounds disclosed herein contain one or more asymmetric
       centers and thus occur as racemates and racemic mixtures, single enantiomers, individual
       diastereomers and diastereomeric mixtures. In one embodiment isomeric forms of these
       compounds are included in the present invention unless expressly provided otherwise. In some
       embodiments, one or more compounds disclosed herein are also represented in multiple
       tautomeric forms, in such instances, the one or more compounds includes all tautomeric forms of
       the compounds described herein (e.g., if alkylation of a ring system results in alkylation at
       multiple sites, the one or more compounds includes all such reaction products). All such isomeric
       forms of such compounds are included in the present invention unless expressly provided
       otherwise. All crystal forms of the compounds described herein are included in the present
       invention unless expressly provided otherwise.
[0083] As used herein, the terms "increase" and "decrease" mean, respectively, to cause a statistically
       significantly (i.e., p < 0.1) increase or decrease of at least 5%.
[0084] As used herein, the recitation of a numerical range for a variable is intended to convey that the
       invention can be practiced with the variable equal to any of the values within that range. Thus, for
       a variable which is inherently discrete, the variable is equal to any integer value within the
       numerical range, including the end-points of the range. Similarly, for a variable which is
       inherently continuous, the variable is equal to any real value within the numerical range,
       including the end-points of the range. As an example, and without limitation, a variable which is
                                                      -31-

 WO 2013/123267                                                                       PCT/US2013/026241
       described as having values between 0 and 2 takes the values 0, 1 or 2 if the variable is inherently
       discrete, and takes the values 0.0, 0.1, 0.01, 0.001, or any other real values > 0 and      2 if the
       variable is inherently continuous.
[0085] As used herein, unless specifically indicated otherwise, the word "or" is used in the inclusive
       sense of "and/or" and not the exclusive sense of "either/or."
[0086] The term "on average" represents the mean value derived from performing at least three
       independent replicates for each data point.
[0087] The term "biological activity" encompasses structural and functional properties of a macrocycle.
       Biological activity is, for example, structural stability, alpha-helicity, affinity for a target,
       resistance to proteolytic degradation, cell penetrability, intracellular stability, in vivo stability, or
       any combination thereof
[0088] The term "binding affinity" refers to the strength of a binding interaction, for example between a
       peptidomimetic macrocycle and a target. Binding affinity can be expressed, for example, as an
       equilibrium dissociation constant ("KD"), which is expressed in units which are a measure of
       concentration (e.g. M, mM, gM, nM etc). Numerically, binding affinity and KD values vary
       inversely, such that a lower binding affinity corresponds to a higher KD value, while a higher
       binding affinity corresponds to a lower KD value. Where high binding affinity is desirable,
       "improved" binding affinity refers to higher binding affinity and therefoere lower KD values.
[0089] The term "ratio of binding affinities" refers to the ratio of dissociation constants (KD values) of a
       first binding interaction (the numerator), versus a second binding interaction (denominator).
       Consequently, a "reduced ratio of binding affinities" to Target 1 versus Target 2 refers to a lower
       value for the ratio expressed as  KD(Target 1)/KD(Target 2). This concept can also be
       characterized as "improved selectivity" for Target 1 versus Target 2, which can be due either to a
       decrease in the KD value for Target 1 or an increase in the value for the KD value for Target 2.
[0090] The term "in vitro efficacy" refers to the extent to which a test compound, such as a
       peptidomimetic macrocycle, produces a beneficial result in an in vitro test system or assay. In
       vitro efficacy can be measured, for example, as an "IC 5 0 " or "EC 0 " value, which represents the
       concentration of the test compound which produces 50% of the maximal effect in the test system.
[0091] The term "ratio of in vitro efficacies" or "in vitro efficacy ratio" refers to the ratio of IC 5 0 or EC50
       values from a first assay (the numerator) versus a second assay (the denominator). Consequently,
       an improved in vitro efficacy ratio for Assay 1 versus Assay 2 refers to a lower value for the ratio
       expressed as ICso(Assay 1)/ICso(Assay 2) or alternatively as ECso(Assay 1)/ECso(Assay 2). This
       concept can also be characterized as "improved selectivity" in Assay 1 versus Assay 2, which can
       be due either to a decrease in the IC 50 or EC50 value for Target 1 or an increase in the value for
       the IC50 or EC50 value for Target 2.

        n is an integer from 1-5.
[0095]   In some embodiments, v and w are integers between 1-30. In some embodiments, w is an integer
         from 3-1000, for example 3-500, 3-200, 3-100, 3-50, 3-30, 3-20, or 3-10.
[0096]   In some embodiments, the peptidomimetic macrocycles are claimed with the proviso that when
        u=1 and w=2, the first C-terminal amino acid represented by E is not an Arginine (R) and/or the
         second C-terminal amino acid represented by E is not a Threonine (T). For instance, when u = 1
         and w= 2, the first C-terminal amino acid and/or the second C-terminal amino acid represented by
         E do not comprise a positively charged side chain or a polar uncharged side chain. In some
         embodiments, when u = 1 and w= 2, the first C-terminal amino acid and/or the second C-terminal
         amino acid represented by E comprise a hydrophobic side chain. For example, when w- 2, the
         first C-terminal amino acid and/or the second N-terminal amino acid represented by E comprise a
         hydrophobic side chain, for example a large hydrophobic side chain.
[0097]   In some embodiments, w is between 3 and 1000. For example, the third amino acid represented
        by E comprises a large hydrophobic side chain.
[0098]   In some embodiments of a peptidomimetic macrocycle of Formula I, L I and L 2 , either alone or in
         combination, do not form an all hydrocarbon chain or a thioether. In other embodiments of a
        peptidomimetic macrocycle of Formula II, L I and L 2, either alone or in combination, do not form
         an all hydrocarbon chain or a triazole.
[0099]   In one example, at least one of Ri and R 2 is alkyl, unsubstituted or substituted with halo-. In
         another example, both R and R 2 are independently alkyl, unsubstituted or substituted with halo-.
         In some embodiments, at least one of R and R 2 is methyl. In other embodiments, R and R 2 are
        methyl.

         or 10. In some embodiments, the sum of x+y+z is 3 or 6. In some embodiments, the sum of
         x+y+z is 3. In other embodiments, the sum of x+y+z is 6. Each occurrence of A, B, C, D or E in a
         macrocycle or macrocycle precursor is independently selected. For example, a sequence
         represented by the formula [A],, when x is 3, encompasses embodiments where the amino acids
         are not identical, e.g. Gln-Asp-Ala as well as embodiments where the amino acids are identical,
         e.g. Gln-Gln-Gln. This applies for any value of x, y, or z in the indicated ranges. Similarly, when
         u is greater than 1, each compound can encompass peptidomimetic macrocycles which are the
         same or different. For example, a compound can comprise peptidomimetic macrocycles
         comprising different linker lengths or chemical compositions.
[00101] In some embodiments, the peptidomimetic macrocycle comprises a secondary structure which is
         an a-helix and R 8 is -H, allowing intrahelical hydrogen bonding. In some embodiments, at least

[00111] In other embodiments, D and/or E in a compound of Formula I or II are further modified in order
        to facilitate cellular uptake. In some embodiments, lipidating or PEGylating a peptidomimetic
        macrocycle facilitates cellular uptake, increases bioavailability, increases blood circulation, alters
        pharmacokinetics, decreases immunogenicity and/or decreases the needed frequency of
        administration.
[00112] In other embodiments, at least one of [D] and [E] in a compound of Formula I or II represents a
        moiety comprising an additional macrocycle-forming linker such that the peptidomimetic
        macrocycle comprises at least two macrocycle-forming linkers. In a specific embodiment, a
        peptidomimetic macrocycle comprises two macrocycle-forming linkers. In an embodiment, u is
        2.
[00113] In some embodiments, any of the macrocycle-forming linkers described herein can be used in any
        combination with any of the sequences shown in Tables 4, 4a, 4b, 6, and 6a and also with any of
        the R- substituents indicated herein.
[00114] In some embodiments, the peptidomimetic macrocycle comprises at least one a-helix motif. For
        example, A, B and/or C in a compound of Formula I or II include one or more a-helices. As a
        general matter, a-helices include between 3 and 4 amino acid residues per turn. In some
        embodiments, the a-helix of the peptidomimetic macrocycle includes 1 to 5 turns and, therefore,
        3 to 20 amino acid residues. In specific embodiments, the a-helix includes 1 turn, 2 turns, 3 turns,
        4 turns, or 5 turns. In some embodiments, the macrocycle-forming linker stabilizes an a-helix
        motif included within the peptidomimetic macrocycle. Thus, in some embodiments, the length of
        the macrocycle-forming linker L from a first Ca to a second Ca is selected to increase the
        stability of an a-helix. In some embodiments, the macrocycle-forming linker spans from 1 turn to
        5 turns of the a-helix. In some embodiments, the macrocycle-forming linker spans approximately
         1 turn, 2 turns, 3 turns, 4 turns, or 5 turns of the a-helix. In some embodiments, the length of the
        macrocycle-forming linker is approximately 5 Ato 9         A per turn of the a-helix, or approximately
        6  A to 8 A per turn of the   a-helix. Where the macrocycle-forming linker spans approximately 1

     approximately 24 carbon-carbon bonds. Where the macrocycle-forming linker spans
     approximately 5 turns of an a-helix, the length is equal to approximately 26 carbon-carbon bonds
     to 34 carbon-carbon bonds, approximately 28 carbon-carbon bonds to 32 carbon-carbon bonds, or
     approximately 30 carbon-carbon bonds. Where the macrocycle-forming linker spans
     approximately 1 turn of an a-helix, the linkage contains approximately 4 atoms to 12 atoms,
     approximately 6 atoms to 10 atoms, or approximately 8 atoms. Where the macrocycle-forming
     linker spans approximately 2 turns of the a-helix, the linkage contains approximately 7 atoms to
      15 atoms, approximately 9 atoms to 13 atoms, or approximately 11 atoms. Where the
     macrocycle-forming linker spans approximately 3 turns of the a-helix, the linkage contains
     approximately 13 atoms to 21 atoms, approximately 15 atoms to 19 atoms, or approximately 17
     atoms. Where the macrocycle-forming linker spans approximately 4 turns of the a-helix, the
     linkage contains approximately 19 atoms to 27 atoms, approximately 21 atoms to 25 atoms, or
     approximately 23 atoms. Where the macrocycle-forming linker spans approximately 5 turns of
     the a-helix, the linkage contains approximately 25 atoms to 33 atoms, approximately 27 atoms to
     31 atoms, or approximately 29 atoms. Where the macrocycle-forming linker spans approximately
      1 turn of the a-helix, the resulting macrocycle forms a ring containing approximately 17 members

     the a-helix, the resulting macrocycle forms a ring containing approximately 59 members to 67
     members, approximately 61 members to 65 members, or approximately 63 members. Where the
     macrocycle-forming linker spans approximately 5 turns of the a-helix, the resulting macrocycle

[00115] Unless otherwise stated, any compounds (including peptidomimetic macrocycles, macrocycle
        precursors, and other compositions) are also meant to encompass compounds which differ only in
        the presence of one or more isotopically enriched atoms. For example, compounds having the
        described structures except for the replacement of a hydrogen by a deuterium or tritium, or the
        replacement of a carbon by "C- or 'C-enriched carbon are contemplated herein.
[00116] In some embodiments, the peptidomimetic macrocycle has improved binding affinity to MDM2
        or MDMX relative to a corresponding peptidomimetic macrocycle where w is 0, 1 or 2. In other
        instances, the peptidomimetic macrocycle has a reduced ratio of binding affinities to MDMX
        versus MDM2 relative to a corresponding peptidomimetic macrocycle where w is 0, 1 or 2. In
        still other instances, the peptidomimetic macrocycle has improved in vitro anti-tumor efficacy
        against p53 positive tumor cell lines relative to a corresponding peptidomimetic macrocycle
        where w is 0, 1 or 2. In some embodiments, the peptidomimetic macrocycle shows improved in
        vitro induction of apoptosis in p53 positive tumor cell lines relative to a corresponding
        peptidomimetic macrocycle where w is 0, 1 or 2. In other instances, the peptidomimetic

        peptidomimetic macrocycle has improved in vivo anti-tumor efficacy against p53 positive tumors
        relative to a corresponding peptidomimetic macrocycle where w is 0, 1 or 2. In yet other
        instances, the peptidomimetic macrocycle has improved in vivo induction of apoptosis in p53
        positive tumors relative to a corresponding peptidomimetic macrocycle where w is 0, 1 or 2. In
        some embodiments, the peptidomimetic macrocycle has improved cell permeability relative to a
        corresponding peptidomimetic macrocycle where w is 0, 1 or 2. In other cases, the
        peptidomimetic macrocycle has improved solubility relative to a corresponding peptidomimetic
        macrocycle where w is 0, 1 or 2.

[00120] In one embodiment, a compound disclosed herein can contain unnatural proportions of atomic
        isotopes at one or more of atoms that constitute such compounds. For example, the compounds
        can be radiolabeled with radioactive isotopes, such as for example tritium (3H), iodine-125  ([51)
        or carbon-14 ( C). In another embodiment, a compound disclosed herein can have one or more
        carbon atoms replaced with a silicon atom. All isotopic variations of the compounds disclosed
        herein, whether radioactive or not, are contemplated herein.
        Preparation of Peptidomimetic Macrocycles
[00121] Peptidomimetic macrocycles of Formulas I and II can be prepared by any of a variety of methods
        known in the art. For example, macrocycles of Formula I having residues indicated by "$4rn6" or
        "$4a5" in Table 4, Table 4a or Table 4b can be substituted with a residue capable of forming a
        crosslinker with a second residue in the same molecule or a precursor of such a residue.
[00122] In some embodiments, the synthesis of these peptidomimetic macrocycles involves a multi-step
        process that features the synthesis of a peptidomimetic precursor containing an azide moiety and
        an alkyne moiety; followed by contacting the peptidomimetic precursor with a macrocyclization
        reagent to generate a triazole-linked peptidomimetic macrocycle. Such a process is described, for
        example, in US Application 12/037,04 1, filed on February 25, 2008. Macrocycles or macrocycle
        precursors are synthesized, for example, by solution phase or solid-phase methods, and can
        contain both naturally-occurring and non-naturally-occurring amino acids. See, for example,
        Hunt, "The Non-Protein Amino Acids" in Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Amino Acids,
        edited by G.C. Barrett, Chapman and Hall, 1985.
[00123] In some embodiments of macrocycles of Formula I, an azide is linked to the a-carbon of a residue
        and an alkyne is attached to the a-carbon of another residue. In some embodiments, the azide
        moieties are azido-analogs of amino acids L-lysine, D-lysine, alpha-methyl-L-lysine, alpha
        methyl-D-lysine, L-ornithine, D-ornithine, alpha-methyl-L-omithine or alpha-methyl-D
        ornithine. In another embodiment, the alkyne moiety is L-propargylglycine. In yet other
        embodiments, the alkyne moiety is an amino acid selected from the group consisting of L
        propargylglycine, D-propargylglycine, (S)-2-amino-2-methyl-4-pentynoic acid, (R)-2-amino-2
        methyl-4-pentynoic acid, (S)-2-amino-2-methyl-5-hexynoic acid, (R)-2-amino-2-methyl-5

          covalent linkage being formed between the alkyne and azide moiety in the precursor. For
          example, R12 may be methyl when the macrocyclization reagent is a Ru reagent.
[00125] In some embodiments, provided herein is a method for synthesizing a peptidomimetic macrocycle

        and further wherein said contacting step results in a covalent linkage being formed between the
        two thiol groups in Formula III.
[00126] In the peptidomimetic macrocycles disclosed herein, at least one of Ri and R 2 is alkyl, alkenyl,
        alkynyl, arylalkyl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkylalkyl, heteroalkyl, or heterocycloalkyl, unsubstituted or
        substituted with halo-. In some embodiments, both R1 and R2 are independently alkyl, alkenyl,
        alkynyl, arylalkyl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkylalkyl, heteroalkyl, or heterocycloalkyl, unsubstituted or
        substituted with halo-. In some embodiments, at least one of A, B, C, D or E is an a,a
        disubstituted amino acid. In one example, B is an a,-disubstituted amino acid. For instance, at
        least one of A, B, C, D or E is 2-aminoisobutyric acid.
[00127] For example, at least one of R, and  R 2 is alkyl, unsubstituted or substituted with halo-. In another
        example, both R, and R 2 are independently alkyl, unsubstituted or substituted with halo-. In some
        embodiments, at least one of R and    R 2 is methyl. In other embodiments, R and R 2 are methyl.
        The macrocyclization reagent may be a Cu reagent or a Ru reagent.
[00128] In some embodiments, the peptidomimetic precursor is purified prior to the contacting step. In
        other embodiments, the peptidomimetic macrocycle is purified after the contacting step. In still
        other embodiments, the peptidomimetic macrocycle is refolded after the contacting step. The
        method may be performed in solution, or, alternatively, the method may be performed on a solid
        support.
[00129] Also envisioned herein is performing the method disclosed herein in the presence of a target
        macromolecule that binds to the peptidomimetic precursor or peptidomimetic macrocycle under
        conditions that favor said binding. In some embodiments, the method is performed in the
        presence of a target macromolecule that binds preferentially to the peptidomimetic precursor or
        peptidomimetic macrocycle under conditions that favor said binding. The method may also be
        applied to synthesize a library of peptidomimetic macrocycles.
[00130] In some embodiments, an alkyne moiety of the peptidomimetic precursor for making a compound
        of Formula I is a sidechain of an amino acid selected from the group consisting of L
        propargylglycine, D-propargylglycine, (S)-2-amino-2-methyl-4-pentynoic acid, (R)-2-amino-2
        methyl-4-pentynoic acid, (S)-2-amino-2-methyl-5-hexynoic acid, (R)-2-amino-2-methyl-5

        methyl-8-nonynoic acid, and (R)-2-amino-2-methyl-8-nonynoic acid. In other embodiments, an
        azide moiety of the peptidoniimetic precursor for making a compound of Formula I is a sidechain
        of an amino acid selected from the group consisting of s-azido-L-lysine, c-azido-D-lysine, a
        azido-a-methyl-L-lysine, s-azido-a -methyl-D-lysine,     6-azido-a-methyl-L-omithine, and 5-azido
        a -methyl-D-omithine.
[00131] In some embodiments, a thiol group of the peptidomimetic precursor for making a compound of
        Formula II is a sidechain of an amino acid selected from the group consisting of L-cysteine, D

        phase peptide synthesis.
[00132] In some embodiments, x+y+z is 3, and and A, B and C are independently natural or non-natural
        amino acids. In other embodiments, x+y+z is 6, and and A, B and C are independently natural or
        non-natural amino acids.
[00133] In some embodiments, the contacting step is performed in a solvent selected from the group
        consisting of protic solvent, aqueous solvent, organic solvent, and mixtures thereof. For example,
        the solvent may be chosen from the group consisting of H 20, THF, THF/H 20, tBuOH/H 2 0,
        DMF, DIPEA, CH 3CN or CH 2 Cl2 , ClCH 2CH 2 Cl or a mixture thereof. The solvent may be a
        solvent which favors helix formation.
[00134] Alternative but equivalent protecting groups, leaving groups or reagents are substituted, and
        certain of the synthetic steps are performed in alternative sequences or orders to produce the
        desired compounds. Synthetic chemistry transformations and protecting group methodologies
        (protection and deprotection) useful in synthesizing the compounds described herein include, for
        example, those such as described in Larock, Comprehensive Organic Transformations, VCH
        Publishers (1989); Greene and Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 2d. Ed. , John
        Wiley and Sons (1991); Fieser and Fieser, Fieser and Fieser's Reagents for Organic Synthesis,
        John Wiley and Sons (1994); and Paquette, ed., Encyclopedia of Reagents for Organic Synthesis,
        John Wiley and Sons (1995), and subsequent editions thereof.
[00135] The peptidomimetic macrocycles disclosed herein are made, for example, by chemical synthesis
        methods, such as described in Fields et al., Chapter 3 in Synthetic Peptides: A User's Guide, ed.
        Grant, W. H. Freeman & Co., New York, N. Y., 1992, p. 77. Hence, for example, peptides are
        synthesized using the automated Merrifield techniques of solid phase synthesis with the amine
        protected by either tBoc or Fmoc chemistry using side chain protected amino acids on, for
        example, an automated peptide synthesizer (e.g., Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA), Model
        430A, 431, or 433).
[00136] One manner of producing the peptidomimetic precursors and peptidomimetic macrocycles
        described herein uses solid phase peptide synthesis (SPPS). The C-terminal amino acid is
        attached to a cross-linked polystyrene resin via an acid labile bond with a linker molecule. This
        resin is insoluble in the solvents used for synthesis, making it relatively simple and fast to wash
        away excess reagents and by-products. The N-terminus is protected with the Fmoc group, which
        is stable in acid, but removable by base. Side chain functional groups are protected as necessary
        with base stable, acid labile groups.

[00137] Longer peptidomimetic precursors are produced, for example, by conjoining individual synthetic
        peptides using native chemical ligation. Alternatively, the longer synthetic peptides are
        biosynthesized by well known recombinant DNA and protein expression techniques. Such
        techniques are provided in well-known standard manuals with detailed protocols. To construct a
        gene encoding a peptidomimetic precursor disclosed herein, the amino acid sequence is reverse
        translated to obtain a nucleic acid sequence encoding the amino acid sequence, preferably with
        codons that are optimum for the organism in which the gene is to be expressed. Next, a synthetic
        gene is made, typically by synthesizing oligonucleotides which encode the peptide and any
        regulatory elements, if necessary. The synthetic gene is inserted in a suitable cloning vector and
        transfected into a host cell. The peptide is then expressed under suitable conditions appropriate
        for the selected expression system and host. The peptide is purified and characterized by standard
        methods.
[00138] The peptidomimetic precursors are made, for example, in a high-throughput, combinatorial
        fashion using, for example, a high-throughput polychannel combinatorial synthesizer (e.g.,
        Thuramed TETRAS multichannel peptide synthesizer from CreoSalus, Louisville, KY or Model
        Apex 396 multichannel peptide synthesizer from AAPPTEC, Inc., Louisville, KY).
[00139] The following synthetic schemes are provided solely to illustrate the present invention and are not
        intended to limit the scope of the invention, as described herein.
[00140] Synthetic schemes 1-5 describe the preparation of peptidomimetic macrocycles of Formula I. To
        simplify the drawings, the illustrative schemes depict azido amino acid analogs s-azido-a-methyl
        L-lysine and c-azido-a -methyl-D-lysine, and alkyne amino acid analogs L-propargylglycine, (S)
        2-amino-2-methyl-4-pentynoic acid, and (S)-2-amino-2-methyl-6-heptynoic acid. Thus, in the
        following synthetic schemes, each R 1, R 2, R 7 and R 8 is -H; each L1 is -(CH2) 4-; and each L 2 is
        (CH 2)-. However, as noted throughout the detailed description above, many other amino acid
        analogs can be employed in which R 1, R 2, R 7, R8 , L, and L 2 can be independently selected from
        the various structures disclosed herein.

[00142] Synthetic Scheme 1 describes the preparation of several compounds useful for preparing
        compounds of Formula I as disclosed herein. Ni(II) complexes of Schiff bases derived from the
        chiral auxiliary (S)-2-[N-(N'-benzylprolyl)amino]benzophenone (BPB) and amino acids such as
        glycine or alanine are prepared as described in Belokon et al. (1998), TetrahedronAsymm.
        9:4249-4252. The resulting complexes are subsequently reacted with alkylating reagents
        comprising an azido or alkynyl moiety to yield enantiomerically enriched compounds disclosed
        herein. If desired, the resulting compounds can be protected for use in peptide synthesis.

[00144] In the general method for the synthesis of peptidomimetic macrocycles of Formula I shown in
        Synthetic Scheme 2, the peptidomimetic precursor contains an azide moiety and an alkyne moiety
        and is synthesized by solution-phase or solid-phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) using the
        commercially available amino acid N-a-Fmoc-L-propargylglycine and the N-a-Fmoc-protected
        forms of the amino acids (S)-2-amino-2-methyl-4-pentynoic acid, (S)-2-amino-6-heptynoic acid,
        (S)-2-amino-2-methyl-6-heptynoic acid, N-methyl-a-azido-L-lysine, and N-methyl-a-azido-D
        lysine. The peptidomimetic precursor is then deprotected and cleaved from the solid-phase resin
        by standard conditions (e.g., strong acid such as 95% TFA). The peptidomimetic precursor is
        reacted as a crude mixture or is purified prior to reaction with a macrocyclization reagent such as
        a Cu(I) in organic or aqueous solutions (Rostovtsev et al. (2002), Angew. Chem. Int. Ed.

        substitution on a triazole moiety, for example an iodo substitution. Such peptidomimetic
        macrocycles may be prepared from a precursor having the partial structure and using the cross
        linking methods taught herein. Crosslinkers of any length, as described herein, may be prepared
        comprising such substitutions. In one embodiment, the peptidomimetic macrocycle is prepared
        according to the scheme shown below. The reaction is peformed, for example, in the presence of
        CuI and an amine ligand such as TEA or TTTA. See, e.g., Hein et al. Angew. Chem., Int. Ed.

[00161] The present invention contemplates the use of non-naturally-occurring amino acids and amino
        acid analogs in the synthesis of the peptidomimetic macrocycles of Formula I described herein.
        Any amino acid or amino acid analog amenable to the synthetic methods employed for the
        synthesis of stable triazole containing peptidomimetic macrocycles can be used in the present
        invention. For example, L-propargylglycine is contemplated as a useful amino acid in the present
        invention. However, other alkyne-containing amino acids that contain a different amino acid side
        chain are also useful in the invention. For example, L-propargylglycine contains one methylene
        unit between the a-carbon of the amino acid and the alkyne of the amino acid side chain. The
        invention also contemplates the use of amino acids with multiple methylene units between the a
        carbon and the alkyne. Also, the azido-analogs of amino acids L-lysine, D-lysine, alpha-methyl
        L-lysine, and alpha-methyl-D-lysine are contemplated as useful amino acids in the present
        invention. However, other terminal azide amino acids that contain a different amino acid side
        chain are also useful in the invention. For example, the azido-analog of L-lysine contains four
        methylene units between the a-carbon of the amino acid and the terminal azide of the amino acid
        side chain. The invention also contemplates the use of amino acids with fewer than or greater
        than four methylene units between the a-carbon and the terminal azide. The following Table 1
        shows some amino acids useful in the preparation of peptidomimetic macrocycles disclosed

      Table 1 shows exemplary amino acids useful in the preparation of peptidomimetic
      macrocycles disclosed herein.
[00162] In some embodiments the amino acids and amino acid analogs are of the D-configuration. In
         other embodiments they are of the L-configuration. In some embodiments, some of the amino
         acids and amino acid analogs contained in the peptidomimetic are of the D-configuration while
         some of the amino acids and amino acid analogs are of the L-configuration. In some
         embodiments the amino acid analogs are a,a-disubstituted, such as a-methyl-L-propargylglycine,
         a-methyl-D-propargylglycine, s-azido-alpha-methyl-L-lysine, and s-azido-alpha-methyl-D

[00163] The preparation of macrocycles of Formula II is described, for example, in US Application
         11/957,325, filed on December 17, 2007 and herein incorporated by reference. Synthetic
        Schemes 6-9 describe the preparation of such compounds of Formula II. To simplify the
        drawings, the illustrative schemes depict amino acid analogs derived from L-or D-cysteine, in
        which L, and L3 are both -(CH 2)-. However, as noted throughout the detailed description above,
        many other amino acid analogs can be employed in which L I and L3 can be independently
        selected from the various structures disclosed herein. The symbols "[AA]m", "[AA],", "[AA]."
        represent a sequence of amide bond-linked moieties such as natural or unnatural amino acids. As
        described previously, each occurrence of "AA" is independent of any other occurrence of "AA",
        and a formula such as "[AA]m" encompasses, for example, sequences of non-identical amino
        acids as well as sequences of identical amino acids.

     precursor peptidomimetic is reacted as a crude mixture or is purified prior to reaction with X-L 2
     Y in organic or aqueous solutions. In some embodiments the alkylation reaction is performed
     under dilute conditions (i.e. 0.15 mmol/L) to favor macrocyclization and to avoid polymerization.
     In some embodiments, the alkylation reaction is performed in organic solutions such as liquid
     NH 3 (Mosberg et al. (1985), J. Am.Chem. Soc. 107:2986-2987; Szewczuk et al. (1992), Int. J.

[00165] In Scheme 7, the precursor peptidomimetic contains two or more -SH moieties, of which two are
        specially protected to allow their selective deprotection and subsequent alkylation for macrocycle
        formation. The precursor peptidomimetic is synthesized by solid-phase peptide synthesis (SPPS)
        using commercially available N-a-Fmoc amino acids such as N-a-Fmoc-S-p-methoxytrityl-L
        cysteine or N-a-Fmoc-S-p-methoxytrityl-D-cysteine. Alpha-methylated versions of D-cysteine or
        L-cysteine are generated by known methods (Seebach et al. (1996), Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl.
        35:2708-2748, and references therein) and then converted to the appropriately protected N-a
        Fmoc-S-p-methoxytrityl monomers by known methods (Bioorganic Chemistry: Peptides and
        Proteins, Oxford University Press, New York: 1998, the entire contents of which are incorporated
        herein by reference). The Mmt protecting groups of the peptidomimetic precursor are then
        selectively cleaved by standard conditions (e.g., mild acid such as 1% TFA in DCM). The
        precursor peptidomimetic is then reacted on the resin with X-L 2 -Y in an organic solution. For
        example, the reaction takes place in the presence of a hindered base such as
        diisopropylethylamine. In some embodiments, the alkylation reaction is performed in organic
        solutions such as liquid NH3 (Mosberg et al. (1985), J Am. Chem. Soc. 107:2986-2987; Szewczuk
        et al. (1992), Int. J. Peptide ProteinRes. 40 :233-242), NH3/MeOH or NH 3/DMF (Or et al.
        (1991), J. Org. Chem. 56:3146-3149). In other embodiments, the alkylation reaction is performed
        in DMF or dichloroethane. The peptidomimetic macrocycle is then deprotected and cleaved from
        the solid-phase resin by standard conditions (e.g., strong acid such as 95% TFA).

[00166] In Scheme 8, the peptidomimetic precursor contains two or more -SH moieties, of which two are
        specially protected to allow their selective deprotection and subsequent alkylation for macrocycle
        formation. The peptidomimetic precursor is synthesized by solid-phase peptide synthesis (SPPS)
        using commercially available N-a-Fmoc amino acids such as N-a-Fmoc-S-p-methoxytrityl-L
        cysteine, N-a-Fmoc-S-p-methoxytrityl-D-cysteine, N-a-Fmoc-S-S-t-butyl-L-cysteine, and N-a
        Fmoc-S-S-t-butyl-D-cysteine. Alpha-methylated versions of D-cysteine or L-cysteine are
        generated by known methods (Seebach et al. (1996), Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 35:2708-2748,
        and references therein) and then converted to the appropriately protected N-a-Fmoc-S-p
        methoxytrityl or N-a-Fmoc-S-S-t-butyl monomers by known methods (Bioorganic Chemistry:
        Peptides and Proteins, Oxford University Press, New York: 1998, the entire contents of which are
        incorporated herein by reference). The S-S-tButyl protecting group of the peptidomimetic
        precursor is selectively cleaved by known conditions (e.g., 20% 2-mercaptoethanol in DMF,
        reference: Galande et al. (2005), J. Comb. Chem. 7:174-177). The precursor peptidomimetic is
        then reacted on the resin with a molar excess of X-L2 -Y in an organic solution. For example, the
        reaction takes place in the presence of a hindered base such as diisopropylethylamine. The Mint
        protecting group of the peptidomimetic precursor is then selectively cleaved by standard
        conditions (e.g., mild acid such as 1% TFA in DCM). The peptidomimetic precursor is then
        cyclized on the resin by treatment with a hindered base in organic solutions. In some
                                                               -68-

        embodiments, the alkylation reaction is performed in organic solutions such as NH 3/MeOH or
        NH 3/DMF (Or et at. (1991), J. Org. Chem. 56:3146-3149). The peptidomimetic macrocycle is
        then deprotected and cleaved from the solid-phase resin by standard conditions (e.g., strong acid
        such as 95% TFA).

[00167] In Scheme 9, the peptidomimetic precursor contains two L-cysteine moieties. The
        peptidomimetic precursor is synthesized by known biological expression systems in living cells
        or by known in vitro, cell-free, expression methods. The precursor peptidomimetic is reacted as a
        crude mixture or is purified prior to reaction with X-L2-Y in organic or aqueous solutions. In
        some embodiments the alkylation reaction is performed under dilute conditions (i.e. 0.15
        mmol/L) to favor macrocyclization and to avoid polymerization. In some embodiments, the
        alkylation reaction is performed in organic solutions such as liquid NH 3 (Mosberg et al. (1985), J.
        Am.Chem. Soc. 107:2986-2987; Szewczuk et al. (1992), Int. J. Peptide Protein Res. 40 :233
        242), NH3/MeOH, or NH3/DMF (Or et al. (1991), J. Org. Chem. 56:3146-3149). In other
        embodiments, the alkylation is performed in an aqueous solution such as 6M guanidinium HCL,
        pH 8 (Brunel et al. (2005), Chem. Commun. (20):2552-2554). In other embodiments, the
        alkylation is performed in DMF or dichloroethane. In another embodiment, the alkylation is
        performed in non-denaturing aqueous solutions, and in yet another embodiment the alkylation is
        performed under conditions that favor a-helical structure formation. In yet another embodiment,
        the alkylation is performed under conditions that favor the binding of the precursor
        peptidomimetic to another protein, so as to induce the formation of the bound a-helical
        conformation during the alkylation.
[00168] Various embodiments for X and Y are envisioned which are suitable for reacting with thiol
        groups. In general, each X or Y is independently be selected from the general category shown in
        Table 2. For example, X and Y are halides such as -Cl, -Br or -I. Any of the macrocycle
        forming linkers described herein may be used in any combination with any of the sequences
        shown and also with any of the R- substituents indicated herein.

[00169] The present invention contemplates the use of both naturally-occurring and non-naturally
        occurring amino acids and amino acid analogs in the synthesis of the peptidomimetic
        macrocycles of Formula II. Any amino acid or amino acid analog amenable to the synthetic
        methods employed for the synthesis of stable bis-sulfhydryl containing peptidomimetic
        macrocycles can be used in the present invention. For example, cysteine is contemplated as a
        useful amino acid in the present invention. However, sulfur containing amino acids other than
        cysteine that contain a different amino acid side chain are also useful. For example, cysteine
        contains one methylene unit between the a-carbon of the amino acid and the terminal -SH of the
        amino acid side chain. The invention also contemplates the use of amino acids with multiple
        methylene units between the a-carbon and the terminal -SH. Non-limiting examples include a
        methyl-L-homocysteine and a-methyl-D-homocysteine. In some embodiments the amino acids
        and amino acid analogs are of the D- configuration. In other embodiments they are of the L
        configuration. In some embodiments, some of the amino acids and amino acid analogs contained
        in the peptidomimetic are of the D- configuration while some of the amino acids and amino acid
        analogs are of the L- configuration. In some embodiments the amino acid analogs are a,a
        disubstituted, such as a-methyl-L-cysteine and a-methyl-D-cysteine.
[00170] The invention includes macrocycles in which macrocycle-forming linkers are used to link two or
        more -SH moieties in the peptidomimetic precursors to form the peptidomimetic macrocycles
        disclosed herein. As described above, the macrocycle-forming linkers impart conformational
        rigidity, increased metabolic stability and/or increased cell penetrability. Furthermore, in some
        embodiments, the macrocycle-forming linkages stabilize the a-helical secondary structure of the
        peptidomimetic macrocyles. The macrocycle-forming linkers are of the formula X-L2 -Y, wherein
        both X and Y are the same or different moieties, as defined above. Both X and Y have the
        chemical characteristics that allow one macrocycle-forming linker -L 2- to bis alkylate the bis
        sulfhydryl containing peptidomimetic precursor. As defined above, the linker -L 2 - includes
        alkylene, alkenylene, alkynylene, heteroalkylene, cycloalkylene, heterocycloalkylene,
        cycloarylene, or heterocycloarylene, or -R 1 -K-1h-, all of which can be optionally substituted
        with an R5 group, as defined above. Furthermore, one to three carbon atoms within the
        macrocycle-forming linkers -L 2 -, other than the carbons attached to the -SH of the sulfhydryl
        containing amino acid, are optionally substituted with a heteroatom such as N, S or 0.

 WO 2013/123267                                                                       PCT/US2013/026241
[00171] The L 2 component of the macrocycle-forming linker X-L 2-Y may be varied in length depending
        on, among other things, the distance between the positions of the two amino acid analogs used to
        form the peptidomimetic macrocycle. Furthermore, as the lengths of L1 and/or L 3 components of
        the macrocycle-forming linker are varied, the length of L 2 can also be varied in order to create a
        linker of appropriate overall length for forming a stable peptidomimetic macrocycle. For
        example, if the amino acid analogs used are varied by adding an additional methylene unit to each
        of L1 and L 3 , the length of L 2 are decreased in length by the equivalent of approximately two
        methylene units to compensate for the increased lengths of L I and L3.
[00172] In some embodiments, L 2 is an alkylene group of the formula -(CH2)n-, where n is an integer
        between about I and about 15. For example, n is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10. In other
        embodiments, L 2 is an alkenylene group. In still other embodiments, L 2 is an aryl group.

        U.S. Patent No. 7,202,332. In such embodiments, aminoacid precursors are used containing an
        additional substituent R- at the alpha position. Such aminoacids are incorporated into the
        macrocycle precursor at the desired positions, which can be at the positions where the crosslinker
        is substituted or, alternatively, elsewhere in the sequence of the macrocycle precursor.
        Cyclization of the precursor is then effected according to the indicated method.
[00175] In some embodiments, the -NH moiety of the amino acid is protected using a protecting group,
        including without limitation -Fmoc and -Boc. In other embodiments, the amino acid is not
        protected prior to synthesis of the peptidomimetic macrocycle.
        Assays
[00176] The properties of peptidomimetic macrocycles are assayed, for example, by using the methods
        described below. In some embodiments, a peptidomimetic macrocycle has improved biological
        properties relative to a corresponding polypeptide lacking the substituents described herein.
        Assay to Determine a-helicity
[00177] In solution, the secondary structure of polypeptides with a-helical domains will reach a dynamic
        equilibrium between random coil structures and a-helical structures, often expressed as a "percent
        helicity". Thus, for example, alpha-helical domains are predominantly random coils in solution,
        with a-helical content usually under 25%. Peptidomimetic macrocycles with optimized linkers,
        on the other hand, possess, for example, an alpha-helicity that is at least two-fold greater than that
        of a corresponding uncrosslinked polypeptide. In some embodiments, macrocycles will possess
        an alpha-helicity of greater than 50%. To assay the helicity of peptidomimetic macrocyles, the
        compounds are dissolved in an aqueous solution (e.g. 50 mM potassium phosphate solution at pH
        7, or distilled H 2 0, to concentrations of 25-50 pM). Circular dichroism (CD) spectra are obtained
        on a spectropolarimeter (e.g., Jasco J-710) using standard measurement parameters (e.g.
        temperature, 20'C; wavelength, 190-260 nm; step resolution, 0.5 nm; speed, 20 nm/sec;
        accumulations, 10; response, 1 see; bandwidth, 1 nm; path length, 0.1 cm). The a-helical content
        of each peptide is calculated by dividing the mean residue ellipticity (e.g. [qD]222obs) by the
        reported value for a model helical decapeptide (Yang et al. (1986), Methods Enzymol. 130:208)).
        Assay to Determine Meltine Temperature (Tm).
[00178] A peptidomimetic macrocycle comprising a secondary structure such as an a-helix exhibits, for
        example, a higher melting temperature than a corresponding uncrosslinked polypeptide. Typically
        peptidomimetic macrocycles exhibit Tm of > 60 0 C representing a highly stable structure in
        aqueous solutions. To assay the effect of macrocycle formation on melting temperature,
        peptidomimetic macrocycles or unmodified peptides are dissolved in distilled H 2 0 (e.g. at a final
        concentration of 50 gM) and the Tm is determined by measuring the change in ellipticity over a
                                                       -73-

 WO 2013/123267                                                                       PCT/US2013/026241
        temperature range (e.g. 4 to 95 C) on a spectropolarimeter (e.g., Jasco J-710) using standard
        parameters (e.g. wavelength 222nm; step resolution, 0.5 nm; speed, 20 nm/sec; accumulations,
         10; response, 1 see; bandwidth, 1 nm; temperature increase rate: 1WC/min; path length, 0.1 cm).
        Protease Resistance Assay.
[00179] The amide bond of the peptide backbone is susceptible to hydrolysis by proteases, thereby
        rendering peptidic compounds vulnerable to rapid degradation in vivo. Peptide helix formation,
        however, typically buries the amide backbone and therefore can shield it from proteolytic
        cleavage. The peptidomimetic macrocycles can be subjected to in vitro trypsin proteolysis to
        assess for any change in degradation rate compared to a corresponding uncrosslinked
        polypeptide. For example, the peptidomimetic macrocycle and a corresponding uncrosslinked
        polypeptide are incubated with trypsin agarose and the reactions quenched at various time points
        by centrifugation and subsequent HPLC injection to quantitate the residual substrate by
        ultraviolet absorption at 280 nm. Briefly, the peptidomimetic macrocycle and peptidomimetic
        precursor (5 meg) are incubated with trypsin agarose (Pierce) (S/E -125) for 0, 10, 20, 90, and
         180 minutes. Reactions are quenched by tabletop centrifugation at high speed; remaining
        substrate in the isolated supernatant is quantified by HPLC-based peak detection at 280 nm. The
        proteolytic reaction displays first order kinetics and the rate constant, k, is determined from a plot
        of In[S] versus time (k=-lXslope).
        Ex Vivo Stability Assay.
[00180] Peptidomimetic macrocycles with optimized linkers possess, for example, an ex vivo half-life that
        is at least two-fold greater than that of a corresponding uncrosslinked polypeptide, and possess an
        ex vivo half-life of 12 hours or more. For ex vivo serum stability studies, a variety of assays can
        be used. For example, a peptidomimetic macrocycle and a corresponding uncrosslinked
        polypeptide (2 meg) are incubated with fresh mouse, rat and/or human serum (2 mL) at 37 0 C for
        0, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 24 hours. To determine the level of intact compound, the following procedure
        can be used: The samples are extracted by transferring 100 gl of sera to 2 ml centrifuge tubes
        followed by the addition of 10 gL of 50 % formic acid and 500gL acetonitrile and centrifugation
        at 14,000 RPM for 10 min at 4  2 0 C. The supernatants are then transferred to fresh 2 ml tubes
        and evaporated on Turbovap under N 2 < 10 psi, 37 0 C. The samples are reconstituted in 100gL of
        50:50 acetonitrile:water and submitted to LC-MS/MS analysis.
        In vitro Binding Assays.
[00181] To assess the binding and affinity of peptidomimetic macrocycles and peptidomimetic precursors
        to acceptor proteins, a fluorescence polarization assay (FPA) isused, for example. The FPA
        technique measures the molecular orientation and mobility using polarized light and fluorescent
        tracer. When excited with polarized light, fluorescent tracers (e.g., FITC) attached to molecules
        with high apparent molecular weights (e.g. FITC-labeled peptides bound to a large protein) emit
                                                      -74-

 WO 2013/123267                                                                     PCT/US2013/026241
        higher levels of polarized fluorescence due to their slower rates of rotation as compared to
        fluorescent tracers attached to smaller molecules (e.g. FITC- labeled peptides that are free in
        solution).
[00182] For example, fluoresceinated peptidomimetic macrocycles (25 nM) are incubated with the
        acceptor protein (25- 10OOnM) in binding buffer (140mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCL, pH 7.4) for
        30 minutes at room temperature. Binding activity is measured, for example, by fluorescence
        polarization on a luminescence spectrophotometer (e.g. Perkin-Elmer LS50B). Kd values can be
        determined by nonlinear regression analysis using, for example, Graphpad Prism software
        (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA). A peptidomimetic macrocycle shows, In some
        embodiments, similar or lower Kd than a corresponding uncrosslinked polypeptide.
        In vitro Displacement Assays To Characterize Antagonists of Peptide-Protein Interactions.
[00183] To assess the binding and affinity of compounds that antagonize the interaction between a peptide
        and an acceptor protein, a fluorescence polarization assay (FPA) utilizing a fluoresceinated
        peptidomimetic macrocycle derived from a peptidomimetic precursor sequence is used, for
        example. The FPA technique measures the molecular orientation and mobility using polarized
        light and fluorescent tracer. When excited with polarized light, fluorescent tracers (e.g., FITC)
        attached to molecules with high apparent molecular weights (e.g. FITC-labeled peptides bound to
        a large protein) emit higher levels of polarized fluorescence due to their slower rates of rotation
        as compared to fluorescent tracers attached to smaller molecules (e.g. FITC-labeled peptides that
        are free in solution). A compound that antagonizes the interaction between the fluoresceinated
        peptidomimetic macrocycle and an acceptor protein will be detected in a competitive binding
        FPA experiment.
[00184] For example, putative antagonist compounds (1 nM to 1 mM) and a fluoresceinated
        peptidomimetic macrocycle (25 nM) are incubated with the acceptor protein (50 nM) in binding
        buffer (140mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCL, pH 7.4) for 30 minutes at room temperature. Antagonist
        binding activity is measured, for example, by fluorescence polarization on a luminescence
        spectrophotometer (e.g. Perkin-Elmer LS50B). Kd values can be determined by nonlinear
        regression analysis using, for example, Graphpad Prism software (GraphPad Software, Inc., San
        Diego, CA).
[00185] Any class of molecule, such as small organic molecules, peptides, oligonucleotides or proteins
        can be examined as putative antagonists in this assay.
        Assay for Protein-ligand binding by Affinity Selection-Mass Spectrometrv
[00186] To assess the binding and affinity of test compounds for proteins, an affinity-selection mass
        spectrometry assay is used, for example. Protein-ligand binding experiments are conducted
        according to the following representative procedure outlined for a system-wide control
        experiment using 1 gM peptidomimetic macrocycle plus 5 gM hMDM2. A 1 gL DMSO aliquot
                                                     -75-

 WO 2013/123267                                                                     PCT/US2013/026241
        of a 40 gM stock solution of peptidomimetic macrocycle is dissolved in 19 gL of PBS
        (Phosphate-buffered saline: 50 mM, pH 7.5 Phosphate buffer containing 150 mM NaCl). The
        resulting solution is mixed by repeated pipetting and clarified by centrifugation at 10 000g for 10
        min. To a 4 gL aliquot of the resulting supernatant is added 4 gL of 10 gM hMDM2 in PBS.
        Each 8.0 pL experimental sample thus contains 40 pmol (1.5 gg) of protein at 5.0 gM
        concentration in PBS plus 1 gM peptidomimetic macrocycle and 2.5% DMSO. Duplicate
        samples thus prepared for each concentration point are incubated for 60 min at room temperature,
        and then chilled to 4 'C prior to size-exclusion chromatography-LC-MS analysis of 5.0 pL
        injections. Samples containing a target protein, protein-ligand complexes, and unbound
        compounds are injected onto an SEC column, where the complexes are separated from non
        binding component by a rapid SEC step. The SEC column eluate is monitored using UV detectors
        to confirm that the early-eluting protein fraction, which elutes in the void volume of the SEC
        column, is well resolved from unbound components that are retained on the column. After the
        peak containing the protein and protein-ligand complexes elutes from the primary UV detector, it
        enters a sample loop where it is excised from the flow stream of the SEC stage and transferred
        directly to the LC-MS via a valving mechanism. The (M + 3H) 3 ' ion of the peptidomimetic
        macrocycle is observed by ESI-MS at the expected m/z, confirming the detection of the protein
        ligand complex.
        Assay for Protein-ligand Kd Titration Experiments.
[00187] To assess the binding and affinity of test compounds for proteins, a protein-ligand Kd titration
        experiment is performed, for example. Protein-ligand KAdtitrations experiments are conducted as
        follows: 2 gL DMSO aliquots of a serially diluted stock solution of titrant peptidomimetic
        macrocycle (5, 2.5, ..., 0.098 mM) are prepared then dissolved in 38 gL of PBS. The resulting
        solutions are mixed by repeated pipetting and clarified by centrifugation at 10 000g for 10 min.
        To 4.0 pL aliquots of the resulting supernatants is added 4.0 gL of 10 gM hMDM2 in PBS. Each
        8.0 gL experimental sample thus contains 40 pmol (1.5 gg) of protein at 5.0 [M concentration in
        PBS, varying concentrations (125, 62.5, ..., 0.24 pM) of the titrant peptide, and 2.5% DMSO.
        Duplicate samples thus prepared for each concentration point are incubated at room temperature
        for 30 min, then chilled to 4 'C prior to SEC-LC-MS analysis of 2.0 gL injections. The (M +
        H)' , (M + 2H)t , (M + 3H)3 , and/or (M + Na)'+ ion is observed by ESI-MS; extracted ion
        chromatograms are quantified, then fit to equations to derive the binding affinity  Kd as described

        Assay for Competitive Binding Experiments by Affinity Selection-Mass Spectrometry
[00188] To determine the ability of test compounds to bind competitively to proteins, an affinity selection
        mass spectrometry assay is performed, for example. A mixture of ligands at 40 RM per
        component is prepared by combining 2 jiL aliquots of 400 gM stocks of each of the three
        compounds with 14 ptL of DMSO. Then, 1 jiL aliquots of this 40 jiM per component mixture are
        combined with 1 jL DMSO aliquots of a serially diluted stock solution of titrant peptidomimetic
        macrocycle (10, 5, 2.5, ..., 0.078 mM). These 2 [iL samples are dissolved in 38 jiL of PBS. The
        resulting solutions were mixed by repeated pipetting and clarified by centrifugation at 10 000g
        for 10 min. To 4.0 jiL aliquots of the resulting supernatants is added 4.0 pL of 10 [LM hMDM2
        protein in PBS. Each 8.0 jiL experimental sample thus contains 40 pmol (1.5 jg) of protein at 5.0
        [iM concentration in PBS plus 0.5 jiM ligand, 2.5% DMSO, and varying concentrations (125,
        62.5, ..., 0.98 piM) of the titrant peptidomimetic macrocycle. Duplicate samples thus prepared for
        each concentration point are incubated at room temperature for 60 min, then chilled to 4 'C prior
        to SEC-LC-MS analysis of 2.0 jL injections. Additional details on these and other methods are

        Binding Assays in Intact Cells.
[00189] It is possible to measure binding of peptides or peptidomimetic macrocycles to their natural
        acceptors in intact cells by immunoprecipitation experiments. For example, intact cells are
        incubated with fluoresceinated (FITC-labeled) compounds for 4 hrs in the absence of serum,
        followed by serum replacement and further incubation that ranges from 4-18 hrs. Cells are then
        pelleted and incubated in lysis buffer (50mM Tris [pH 7.6], 150 mM NaCl, 1% CHAPS and
        protease inhibitor cocktail) for 10 minutes at 4C. Extracts are centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 15
        minutes and supernatants collected and incubated with 10 jil goat anti-FIT C antibody for 2 hrs,
        rotating at 40 C followed by further 2 hrs incubation at 40 C with protein A/G Sepharose (50 l of
        50% bead slurry). After quick centrifugation, the pellets are washed in lysis buffer containing
        increasing salt concentration (e.g., 150, 300, 500 mM). The beads are then re-equilibrated at 150
        mM NaCl before addition of SDS-containing sample buffer and boiling. After centrifugation, the
        supernatants are optionally electrophoresed using 4%-12% gradient Bis-Tris gels followed by

        transfer into Immobilon-P membranes. After blocking, blots are optionally incubated with an
        antibody that detects FITC and also with one or more antibodies that detect proteins that bind to
        the peptidomimetic macrocycle.
        Cellular Penetrability Assays.
[00190] A peptidomimetic macrocycle is, for example, more cell penetrable compared to a corresponding
        uncrosslinked macrocycle. Peptidomimetic macrocycles with optimized linkers possess, for
        example, cell penetrability that is at least two-fold greater than a corresponding uncrosslinked
        macrocycle, and often 20% or more of the applied peptidomimetic macrocycle will be observed
        to have penetrated the cell after 4 hours. To measure the cell penetrability of peptidomimetic
        macrocycles and corresponding uncrosslinked macrocycle, intact cells are incubated with
        fluorescently-labeled (e.g. fluoresceinated) peptidomimetic macrocycles or corresponding
        uncrosslinked macrocycle (10 gM) for 4 hrs in serum free media at 37 0 C, washed twice with
        media and incubated with trypsin (0.25%) for 10 min at 37 0 C. The cells are washed again and
        resuspended in PBS. Cellular fluorescence is analyzed, for example, by using either a
        FACSCalibur flow cytometer or Cellomics' KineticScan @ HCS Reader.
        Cellular Efficacy Assays.
[00191] The efficacy of certain peptidomimetic macrocycles is determined, for example, in cell-based
        killing assays using a variety of tumorigenic and non-tumorigenic cell lines and primary cells
        derived from human or mouse cell populations. Cell viability is monitored, for example, over 24
        96 hrs of incubation with peptidomimetic macrocycles (0.5 to 50 RM) to identify those that kill at
        EC5 0 <10 pM. Several standard assays that measure cell viability are commercially available and
        are optionally used to assess the efficacy of the peptidomimetic macrocycles. In addition, assays
        that measure Annexin V and caspase activation are optionally used to assess whether the
        peptidomimetic macrocycles kill cells by activating the apoptotic machinery. For example, the
        Cell Titer-glo assay is used which determines cell viability as a function of intracellular ATP
        concentration.
        In Vivo Stability Assay.
[00192] To investigate the in vivo stability of the peptidomimetic macrocycles, the compounds are, for
        example,administered to mice and/or rats by IV, IP, PO or inhalation routes at concentrations
        ranging from 0.1 to 50 mg/kg and blood specimens withdrawn at 0', 5', 15', 30', 1 hr, 4 hrs, 8 hrs
        and 24 hours post-injection. Levels of intact compound in 25 pL of fresh serum are then
        measured by LC-MS/MS as above.
        In vivo Efficacy in Animal Models.
[00193] To determine the anti-oncogenic activity of peptidomimetic macrocycles in vivo, the compounds
        are, for example, given alone (IP, IV, PO, by inhalation or nasal routes) or in combination with
                                                       -78-

 WO 2013/123267                                                                      PCT/US2013/026241
        sub-optimal doses of relevant chemotherapy (e.g., cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, etoposide). In
        one example, 5 x 106 RS4; 11 cells (established from the bone marrow of a patient with acute
        lymphoblastic leukemia) that stably express luciferase are injected by tail vein in NOD-SCID
        mice 3 hrs after they have been subjected to total body irradiation. If left untreated, this form of
        leukemia is fatal in 3 weeks in this model. The leukemia is readily monitored, for example, by
        injecting the mice with D-luciferin (60 mg/kg) and imaging the anesthetized animals (e.g.,
        Xenogen In Vivo Imaging System, Caliper Life Sciences, Hopkinton, MA). Total body
        bioluminescence is quantified by integration of photonic flux (photons/sec) by Living Image
        Software (Caliper Life Sciences, Hopkinton, MA). Peptidomimetic macrocycles alone or in
        combination with sub-optimal doses of relevant chemotherapeutics agents are, for example,
        administered to leukemia mice (10 days after injection/day 1 of experiment, in bioluminescence
        range of 14-16) by tail vein or IP routes at doses ranging from 0.1mg/kg to 50 mg/kg for 7 to 21
        days. Optionally, the mice are imaged throughout the experiment every other day and survival
        monitored daily for the duration of the experiment. Expired mice are optionally subjected to
        necropsy at the end of the experiment. Another animal model is implantation into NOD-SCID
        mice of DoHH2, a cell line derived from human follicular lymphoma, that stably expresses
        luciferase. These in vivo tests optionally generate preliminary pharmacokinetic,
        pharmacodynamic and toxicology data.
        Clinical Trials.
[00194] To determine the suitability of the peptidomimetic macrocycles for treatment of humans, clinical
        trials are performed. For example, patients diagnosed with cancer and in need of treatment can be
        selected and separated in treatment and one or more control groups, wherein the treatment group
        is administered a peptidomimetic macrocycle, while the control groups receive a placebo or a
        known anti-cancer drug. The treatment safety and efficacy of the peptidomimetic macrocycles
        can thus be evaluated by performing comparisons of the patient groups with respect to factors
        such as survival and quality-of-life. In this example, the patient group treated with a
        peptidomimetic macrocyle can show improved long-term survival compared to a patient control
        group treated with a placebo.

[00195] Pharmaceutical compositions disclosed herein include peptidomimetic macrocycles and
        pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives or prodrugs thereof. A "pharmaceutically acceptable
        derivative" means any pharmaceutically acceptable salt, ester, salt of an ester, pro-drug or other
        derivative of a compound disclosed herein which, upon administration to a recipient, is capable of
        providing (directly or indirectly) a compound disclosed herein. Particularly favored
        pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives are those that increase the bioavailability of the
        compounds when administered to a mammal (e.g., by increasing absorption into the blood of an
                                                      -79-

        orally administered compound) or which increases delivery of the active compound to a
        biological compartment (e.g., the brain or lymphatic system) relative to the parent species. Some
        pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives include a chemical group which increases aqueous
        solubility or active transport across the gastrointestinal mucosa.
[00196] In some embodiments, peptidomimetic macrocycles are modified by covalently or non-covalently
        joining appropriate functional groups to enhance selective biological properties. Such
        modifications include those which increase biological penetration into a given biological
        compartment (e.g., blood, lymphatic system, central nervous system), increase oral availability,
        increase solubility to allow administration by injection, alter metabolism, and alter rate of
        excretion.
[00197] Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds disclosed herein include those derived from
        pharmaceutically acceptable inorganic and organic acids and bases. Examples of suitable acid

        N-(alkyl)4 ' salts.
[00198] For preparing pharmaceutical compositions from the compounds provided herein,
        pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include either solid or liquid carriers. Solid form
        preparations include powders, tablets, pills, capsules, cachets, suppositories, and dispersible
        granules. A solid carrier can be one or more substances, which also acts as diluents, flavoring
        agents, binders, preservatives, tablet disintegrating agents, or an encapsulating material. Details
        on techniques for formulation and administration are well described in the scientific and patent
        literature, see, e.g., the latest edition of Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Maack Publishing
        Co, Easton PA.
[00199] In powders, the carrier is a finely divided solid, which is in a mixture with the finely divided
        active component. In tablets, the active component is mixed with the carrier having the necessary
        binding properties in suitable proportions and compacted in the shape and size desired.
[00200] Suitable solid excipients are carbohydrate or protein fillers include, but are not limited to sugars,
        including lactose, sucrose, mannitol, or sorbitol; starch from corn, wheat, rice, potato, or other
        plants; cellulose such as methyl cellulose, hydroxypropylmethyl-cellulose, or sodium
        carboxymethylcellulose; and gums including arabic and tragacanth; as well as proteins such as
        gelatin and collagen. If desired, disintegrating or solubilizing agents are added, such as the cross
        linked polyvinyl pyrrolidone, agar, alginic acid, or a salt thereof, such as sodium alginate.

[00201] Liquid form preparations include, without limitation, solutions, suspensions, and emulsions, for
        example, water or water/propylene glycol solutions. For parenteral injection, liquid preparations
        can be formulated in solution in aqueous polyethylene glycol solution.
[00202] The pharmaceutical preparation can be in unit dosage form. In such form the preparation is
        subdivided into unit doses containing appropriate quantities of the active component. The unit
        dosage form can be a packaged preparation, the package containing discrete quantities of
        preparation, such as packeted tablets, capsules, and powders in vials or ampoules. Also, the unit
        dosage form can be a capsule, tablet, cachet, or lozenge itself, or it can be the appropriate number
        of any of these in packaged form.
[00203] When one or more compositions disclosed herein comprise a combination of a peptidomimetic
        macrocycle and one or more additional therapeutic or prophylactic agents, both the compound
        and the additional agent should be present at dosage levels of between about I to 100%, and more
        preferably between about 5 to 95% of the dosage normally administered in a monotherapy
        regimen. In some embodiments, the additional agents are administered separately, as part of a
        multiple dose regimen, from one or more compounds disclosed herein. Alternatively, those agents
        are part of a single dosage form, mixed together with one or more compounds disclosed herein in
        a single composition.
        Methods of Use
[00204] In one aspect, provided herein are novel peptidomimetic macrocycles that are useful in
        competitive binding assays to identify agents which bind to the natural ligand(s) of the proteins or
        peptides upon which the peptidomimetic macrocycles are modeled. For example, in the
        p53/MDIX system, labeled peptidomimetic macrocycles based on p53 can be used in a MDMX
        binding assay along with small molecules that competitively bind to MDMX. Competitive
        binding studies allow for rapid in vitro evaluation and determination of drug candidates specific
        for the p53/MDMX system. Such binding studies can be performed with any of the
        peptidomimetic macrocycles disclosed herein and their binding partners.
[00205] Provided herein is the generation of antibodies against the peptidomimetic macrocycles. In some
        embodiments, these antibodies specifically bind both the peptidomimetic macrocycle and the
        precursor peptides, such as p53, to which the peptidomimetic macrocycles are related. Such
        antibodies, for example, disrupt the native protein-protein interaction, for example, binding
        between p53 and MDMX.
[00206] In other aspects, provided herein are both prophylactic and therapeutic methods of treating a
        subject at risk of (or susceptible to) a disorder or having a disorder associated with aberrant (e.g.,
        insufficient or excessive) expression or activity of the molecules including p53, MDM2 or
        MDMX.
[00207] In another embodiment, a disorder is caused, at least in part, by an abnormal level of p53 or
        MDM2 or MDMX, (e.g., over or under expression), or by the presence of p53 or MDM2 or
                                                       -81-

 WO 2013/123267                                                                       PCT/US2013/026241
        MDMX exhibiting abnormal activity. As such, the reduction in the level and/or activity of p53 or
        MDM2 or MDMX, or the enhancement of the level and/or activity of p53 or MDM2 or MDMX,
        by peptidomimetic macrocycles derived from p53, is used, for example, to ameliorate or reduce
        the adverse symptoms of the disorder.
[00208] In another aspect, provided herein are methods for treating or preventing a disease including
        hyperproliferative disease and inflammatory disorder by interfering with the interaction or
        binding between binding partners, for example, between p53 and MDM2 or p53 and MDMX.
        These methods comprise administering an effective amount of a compound to a warm blooded
        animal, including a human. In some embodiments, the administration of one or more compounds
        disclosed herein induces cell growth arrest or apoptosis.
[00209] As used herein, the term "treatment" is defined as the application or administration of a
        therapeutic agent to a patient, or application or administration of a therapeutic agent to an isolated
        tissue or cell line from a patient, who has a disease, a symptom of disease or a predisposition
        toward a disease, with the purpose to cure, heal, alleviate, relieve, alter, remedy, ameliorate,
        improve or affect the disease, the symptoms of disease or the predisposition toward disease.
[00210] In some embodiments, the peptidomimetics macrocycles can be used to treat, prevent, and/or
        diagnose cancers and neoplastic conditions. As used herein, the terms "cancer",
        "hyperproliferative" and "neoplastic" refer to cells having the capacity for autonomous growth,
        i.e., an abnormal state or condition characterized by rapidly proliferating cell growth.
        Hyperproliferative and neoplastic disease states can be categorized as pathologic, i.e.,
        characterizing or constituting a disease state, or can be categorized as non-pathologic, i.e., a
        deviation from normal but not associated with a disease state. The term is meant to include all
        types of cancerous growths or oncogenic processes, metastatic tissues or malignantly transformed
        cells, tissues, or organs, irrespective of histopathologic type or stage of invasiveness. A metastatic
        tumor can arise from a multitude of primary tumor types, including but not limited to those of
        breast, lung, liver, colon and ovarian origin. "Pathologic hyperproliferative" cells occur in disease
        states characterized by malignant tumor growth. Examples of non-pathologic hyperproliferative
        cells include proliferation of cells associated with wound repair. Examples of cellular
        proliferative and/or differentiative disorders include cancer, e.g., carcinoma, sarcoma, or
        metastatic disorders. In some embodiments, the peptidomimetics macrocycles are novel
        therapeutic agents for controlling breast cancer, ovarian cancer, colon cancer, lung cancer,
        metastasis of such cancers and the like.

[00212] Examples of proliferative disorders include hematopoietic neoplastic disorders. As used herein,
        the term "hematopoietic neoplastic disorders" includes diseases involving hyperplastic/neoplastic
        cells of hematopoietic origin, e.g., arising from myeloid, lymphoid or erythroid lineages, or
        precursor cells thereof. The diseases can arise from poorly differentiated acute leukemias, e.g.,
        erythroblastic leukemia and acute megakaryoblastic leukemia. Additional exemplary myeloid
        disorders include, but are not limited to, acute promyeloid leukemia (APML), acute myelogenous
        leukemia (AML) and chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) (reviewed in Vaickus (1991), Crit
        Rev. Oncol./Hemotol. 11:267-97); lymphoid malignancies include, but are not limited to acute

Example 2: Peptidomimetic macrocycles of Formula I.
[00233] Peptidomimetic macrocycles are prepared as described herein and as in pending U.S. Patent
        Application No. 12/037,041, filed February 25, 2008, which is hereby incorporated by reference
        in its entirety. Peptidomimetic macrocycles are designed by replacing two or more naturally
        occurring amino acids with the corresponding synthetic amino acids. Substitutions are made at i
        and i+4, and i and i+7 positions. Peptide synthesis is performed either manually or on an
        automated peptide synthesizer (Applied Biosystems, model 433A), using solid phase conditions,
        rink amide AM resin (Novabiochem), and Fmoc main-chain protecting group chemistry. For the
        coupling of natural Fmoc-protected amino acids (Novabiochem), 10 equivalents of amino acid
        and a 1:1:2 molar ratio of coupling reagents HBTU/HOBt (Novabiochem)/DIEA are employed.
        Non-natural amino acids (4 equiv) are coupled with a 1:1:2 molar ratio of HATU (Applied
        Biosystems)/HOBt/DIEA. The N-termini of the synthetic peptides are acetylated, while the C
        termini are amidated.
[00234] Generally, ully protected resin-bound peptides were synthesized on a PEG-PS resin (loading 0.45
        mmol/g) on a 0.5 mmol scale. Deprotection of the temporary Fmoc group was achieved by 3 x 10
        min treatments of the resin bound peptide with 20% (v/v) piperidine in DMF. After washing with
        NMP (3x), dichloromethane (3x) and NMP (3x), coupling of each successive amino acid was
        achieved with 1 x 60 min incubation with the appropriate preactivated Fmoc-amino acid
        derivative. All protected amino acids (1.0 mmol) were dissolved in NMP and activated with
        HCTU (1.0 mmol), Cl-HOBt (1.0 mmol) and DIEA (2.0 mmol) prior to transfer of the coupling
        solution to the deprotected resin-bound peptide. After coupling was completed, the resin was
        washed in preparation for the next deprotection/coupling cycle. Acetylation of the amino
        terminus was carried out in the presence of acetic anhydride/DIEA in NMP. The LC-MS analysis
        of a cleaved and deprotected sample obtained from an aliquot of the fully assembled resin-bound
        peptide was accomplished in order to verifying the completion of each coupling.

 WO 2013/123267                                                                    PCT/US2013/026241
[00235] In a typical example for the preparation of a peptidomimetic macrocycle comprising a 1,4
        triazole group (e.g. SP153), 20% (v/v) 2,6-lutidine in DMF was added to the peptide resin (0.5
        mmol) in a 40ml glass vial and shaken for 10 minutes. Sodium ascorbate (0.25g, 1.25 mmol) and
        diisopropylethylamine (0.22ml, 1.25 mmol) were then added, followed by copper(I) iodide
        (0.24g, 1.25 mmol) and the resulting reaction mixture was mechanically shaken 16 hours at
        ambient temperature.
[00236] In a typical example for the preparation of a peptidomimetic macrocycle comprising a 1,5
        triazole group (SP932, SP933), a peptide resin (0.25 mmol) was washed with anhydrous DCM.
        Resin was loaded into a microwave vial. Vessel was evacuated and purged with nitrogen.
        Chloro(pentamethylcyclopentadienyl) bis(triphenylphosphine)ruthenium(II), 10% loading,
        (Strem 44-0117) was added. Anhydrous toluene was added to the reaction vessel. The reaction
        was then loaded into the microwave and held at 90'C for 10 minutes. Reaction may need to be
        pushed a subsequent time for completion. In other cases, Chloro(1,5
        cyclooctadiene)(pentamethylcyclopentadienyl)ruthenium ("Cp*RuCl(cod)") may be used, for
        example at at room temperature in a solvent comprising toluene.
[00237] In a typical example for the preparation of a peptidomimetic macrocycle comprising an iodo
        substituted triazole group (e.g. SP457), THF (2 ml) was added to the peptide resin (0.05 mmol) in
        a 40ml glass vial and shaken for 10 minutes. N-bromosuccimide (0.04g, 0.25 mmol), copper(I)
        iodide (0.05g, 0.25 mmol) and diisopropylethylamine (0.04 ml, 0.25 mmol) were then added and
        the resulting reaction mixture was mechanically shaken 16 hours at ambient temperature. Iodo
        triazole crosslinkers may be further substituted by a coupling reaction, for example with boronic
        acids, to result in a peptidomimetic macrocycle such as SP465. In a typical example, DMF (3 ml)
        was added to the iodo-triazole peptide resin (0.1 mmol) in a 40ml glass vial and shaken for 10
        minutes. Phenyl boronic acid (0.04g, 0.3 mmol), tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0)
        (0.006g, 0.005 mmol) and potassium carbonate (0.083g, 0.6 mmol) were then added and the
        resulting reaction mixture was mechanically shaken 16 hours at 700 C. Jodo-triazole crosslinkers
        may also be further substituted by a coupling reaction, for example with a terminal alkyne (e.g.
        Sonogashira coupling), to result in a peptidomimetic macrocycle such as SP468. In a typical
        example, 2:1 THF:triethylamine (3 ml) was added to the iodo-triazole peptide resin (0.1 mmol) in
        a 40ml glass vial and shaken for 10 minutes. N-BOC-4-pentyne-1-amine (0.04g, 0.2 mmol) and
        bis(triphenylphosphine)palladiumchloride (0.014g, 0.02 mmol) were added and shaken for 5
        minutes. Copper(I) iodide (0.004g, 0.02 mmol) was then added and the resulting reaction
        mixture was mechanically shaken 16 hours at 700 C.
[00238] The triazole-cyclized resin-bound peptides were deprotected and cleaved from the solid support
        by treatment with TFA/H 2 0/TIS (95/5/5 v/v) for 2.5 h at room temperature. After filtration of the
        resin the TFA solution was precipitated in cold diethyl ether and centrifuged to yield the desired
        product as a solid. The crude product was purified by preparative HPLC. For example,

[00242] In some embodiments, a peptidomimetic macrocycle is obtained in more than one isomer, for
        example due to the configuration of a double bond within the structure of the crosslinker (E vs Z).
        Such isomers can or can not be separable by conventional chromatographic methods. In some
        embodiments, one isomer has improved biological properties relative to the other isomer. In one
        embodiment, an E crosslinker olefin isomer of a peptidomimetic macrocycle has better solubility,
        better target affinity, better in vivo or in vitro efficacy, higher helicity, or improved cell
        permeability relative to its Z counterpart. In another embodiment, a Z crosslinker olefin isomer of
        a peptidomimetic macrocycle has better solubility, better target affinity, better in vivo or in vitro
        efficacy, higher helicity, or improved cell permeability relative to its E counterpart.
[00243] Amino acids forming crosslinkers are represented according to the legend indicated below.

[00244] Stereochemistry at the alpha position of each amino acid is S unless otherwise indicated. Amino
        acids labeled "4Me" were prepared using an amino acid comprising an alkyne which was methyl
        substituted (internal alkyne), resulting in triazole groups comprising a methyl group at the 4
        position. Amino acids labeled "4Ph" were prepared using an amino acid comprising an alkyne
        which was phenyl-substituted (internal alkyne), resulting in triazole groups comprising a phenyl
        group at the 4-position. For azide amino acids, the number of carbon atoms indicated refers to the
        number of methylene units between the alpha carbon and the terminal azide. For alkyne amino
        acids, the number of carbon atoms indicated is the number of methylene units between the alpha
        position and the triazole moiety plus the two carbon atoms within the triazole group derived from
        the alkyne.

[00250] Peptides shown can comprise an N-terminal capping group such as acetyl or an additional linker
        such as beta-alanine between the capping group and the start of the peptide sequence.
[00251] In some embodiments, peptidomimetic macrocycles do not comprise a peptidomimetic
        macrocycle structure as shown in Table 5.
Example 3: Peptidomimetic macrocycles of Formula II
[00252] Peptidomimetic macrocycles were designed by replacing two or more naturally occurring amino
        acids with the corresponding synthetic amino acids. Substitutions were made at i and i+4, and i
        and i+7 positions. Macrocycles were generated by solid phase peptide synthesis followed by
        crosslinking the peptides via their thiol-containing side chains. Peptide synthesis is performed
        either manually or on an automated peptide synthesizer (Applied Biosystems, model 433A),
        using solid phase conditions, rink amide AM resin (Novabiochem), and Fmoc main-chain
        protecting group chemistry. The N-termini of the synthetic peptides are acetylated, while the C
        termini are amidated.
[00253] The fully protected resin-bound peptides are synthesized on a Rink amide MBHA resin (loading
        0.62 mmol/g) on a 0.1 mmol scale. Deprotection of the temporary Fmoc group is achieved by 2 x
        20 min treatments of the resin bound peptide with 25% (v/v) piperidine in NMP. After extensive
        flow washing with NMP and dichloromethane, coupling of each successive amino acid was
        achieved with 1 x 60 min incubation with the appropriate preactivated Fmoc-amino acid
        derivative. All protected amino acids (1 mmol) were dissolved in NMP and activated with HCTU
        (1 mmol) and DIEA (1 mmol) prior to transfer of the coupling solution to the deprotected resin
        bound peptide. After coupling was completed, the resin was extensively flow washed in
        preparation for the next deprotection/coupling cycle. Acetylation of the amino terminus was
        carried out in the presence of acetic anhydride/DIEA in NMP /NMM. The LC-MS analysis of a
        cleaved and deprotected sample obtained from an aliquot of the fully assembled resin-bound
        peptide was accomplished in order to verifying the completion of each coupling.
[00254] Purification of cross-linked compounds is achieved by high performance liquid chromatography
        (HPLC) (Varian ProStar) on a reverse phase C18 column (Varian) to yield the pure compounds.
        Chemical composition of the pure products was confirmed by LC/MS mass spectrometry
        (Micromass LCT interfaced with Agilent 1100 HPLC system) and amino acid analysis (Applied
        Biosystems, model 420A).
[00255] In a typical example, a peptide resin (0.1 mmol) was washed with DCM. Deprotection of the
        temporary Mmt group was achieved by 3 x 3 min treatments of the resin bound peptide with 2%
                                                     -107-

        TFA/DCM 5% TIPS, then 30min treatments until no orange color is observed in the filtrate. In
        between treatments the resin was extensively flow washed with DCM. After complete removal of
        Mmt, the resin was washed with 5% DIEA/NMP solution 3X and considered ready for
        bisthioether coupling. Resin was loaded into a reaction vial. DCM/DMF 1/1 was added to the
        reaction vessel, followed by DIEA (2.4eq). After mixing well for 5 minutes, 4,4'
        Bis(bromomethyl)biphenyl (1.05 eq) (TCI America B1921) was added. The reaction was then
        mechanically agitated at room temperature overnight. Where needed, the reaction was allowed
        additional time to reach completion. A similar procedure may be used in the preparation of five
        methylene, six-methylene or seven-methylene crosslinkers ("%c7", "%c6", or "%c5").
[00256] The bisthioether resin-bound peptides were deprotected and cleaved from the solid support by
        treatment with TFA/H 2 0/TIS (94/3/3 v/v) for 3 h at room temperature. After filtration of the resin
        the TFA solution was precipitated in cold diethyl ether and centrifuged to yield the desired
        product as a solid. The crude product was purified by preparative HPLC.

[00262] In some embodiments, a peptidomimetic macrocycle is obtained in more than one isomer, for
        example due to the configuration of a double bond within the structure of the crosslinker (E vs Z).

        embodiments, one isomer has improved biological properties relative to the other isomer. In one
        embodiment, an E crosslinker olefin isomer of a peptidomimetic macrocycle has better solubility,
        better target affinity, better in vivo or in vitro efficacy, higher helicity, or improved cell

Example 4: Circular Dichroism (CD) analysis of alpha-helicity
[00270] Peptide solutions are analyzed by CD spectroscopy using a Jasco J-815 spectropolarimeter (Jasco
        Inc., Easton, MD) with the Jasco Spectra Manager Ver.2 system software. A Peltier temperature
        controller is used to maintain temperature control of the optical cell. Results are expressed as
        mean molar ellipticity [0] (deg cm2 dmol-1) as calculated from the equation
        [0]=Oobs.MRW/10*l*c where Oobs is the observed ellipticity in millidegrees, MRW is the mean
        residue weight of the peptide (peptide molecular weight/number of residues), 1 is the optical path
        length of the cell in centimeters, and c is the peptide concentration in mg/ml. Peptide
        concentrations are determined by amino acid analysis. Stock solutions of peptides are prepared in
        benign CD buffer (20 mM phosphoric acid, pH 2). The stocks are used to prepare peptide
        solutions of 0.05 mg/ml in either benign CD buffer or CD buffer with 50% trifluoroethanol (TFE)
        for analyses in a 10 mm pathlength cell. Variable wavelength measurements of peptide solutions
        are scanned at 4 'C from 195 to 250 nm, in 0.2 nm increments, and a scan rate 50 nm per minute.
        The average of six scans is reported.

Example 13. Cell Lysis by Peptidomimetic Macrocycles
[00294] SJSA- I cells are plated out one day in advance in clear flat-bottom plates (Costar, catalog number
        353072) at 7500cells/well with 100ul/well of growth media, leaving row H columns 10-12 empty
        for media alone. On the day of the assay, media was exchanged with RPMI 1% FBS media, 90uL
        of media per well.
[00295] 10 mlM stock solutions of the peptidomimetic macrocycles are prepared in 100% DMSO.
        Peptidomimetic macrocycles were then diluted serially in 100% DMSO, and then further diluted
        20-fold in sterile water to prepare working stock solutions in 5% DMSO/water of each
        peptidomimetic macrocycle at concentrations ranging from 500 uM to 62.5 uM.
[00296] 10 uL of each compound is added to the 90 uL of SJSA-1 cells to yield final concentrations of 50
        uM to 6.25 uM in 0.5% DMSO-containing media. The negative control (non-lytic) sample was
        0.5% DMSO alone and positive control (lytic) samples include 10 uM Melittin and 1% Triton X
         100.
[00297] Cell plates are incubated for 1 hour at 37C. After the 1 hour incubation, the morphology of the
        cells is examined by microscope and then the plates were centrifuged at 1200rpm for 5 minutes at
        room temperature. 40uL of supernatant for each peptidomimetic macrocyle and control sample is
        transferred to clear assay plates. LDH release is measured using the LDH cytotoxicity assay kit
        from Caymen, catalog# 1000882.
Example 14: p53 GRIP assay
[00298] Thermo Scientific* BioImage p53-MDM2 Redistribution Assay monitors the protein interaction
        with MDM2 and cellular translocation of GFP-tagged p53 in response to drug compounds or
        other stimuli. Recombinant CHO-hIR cells stably express human p53(1-312) fused to the C
        terminus of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) and PDE4A4-MDM2(1-124), a fusion
        protein between PDE4A4 and MDM2(1-124). They provide a ready-to-use assay system for
        measuring the effects of experimental conditions on the interaction of p53 and MDM2. Imaging
        and analysis is performed with a HCS platform.

        scheme as peptides.50 gl of 2X desired concentrations is added to the appropriate well to achieve
        the final desired concentrations. Cells are then incubated with peptides for 6 h at 37 0 C in
        humidified 5% C02 atmosphere. Post-incubation period, cells are fixed by gently aspirating out
        the media and adding 150 gi of fixing solution per well for 20 minutes at room temperature.
        Fixed cells are washed 4 times with 200 gi PBS per well each time. At the end of last wash, 100
        gl of 1 gM Hoechst staining solution is added. Sealed plates incubated for at least 30 min in dark,
        washed with PBS to remove excess stain and PBS is added to each well. Plates can be stored at
        40 C in dark up to 3 days. The translocation of p53/MDM2 is imaged using Molecular
        translocation module on Cellomics Arrayscan instrument using lOx objective, XF-100 filter sets
        for Hoechst and GFP. The output parameters was Mean- CircRINGAvelntenRatio (the ratio of

        acceptable number of cells per well used for image analysis was set to 500 cells.
Example 15: Solubility Determination for Peptidomimetic Macrocycles
[00300] Peptidomimetic macrocyles are first dissolved in neat N, N-dimethylacetamide (DMA, Sigma
        Aldrich, 38840-IL-F) to make 20X stock solutions over a concentration range of 20-140 mg/mL.
        The DMA stock solutions are diluted 20-fold in an aqueous vehicle containing 2% Solutol-HS
         15, 25 mM Histidine, 45 mg/mL Mannitol to obtain final concentrations of 1-7 mg/ml of the
        peptidomimetic macrocycles in 5% DMA, 2% Solutol-HS-15, 25 mM Histidine, 45 mg/mL
        Mannitol. The final solutions are mixed gently by repeat pipetting or light vortexing, and then
        the final solutions are sonicated for 10 min at room temperature in an ultrasonic water bath.
        Careful visual observation is then performed under hood light using a 7x visual amplifier to
        determine if precipitate exists on the bottom or as a suspension. Additional concentration ranges
        are tested as needed to determine the maximum solubility limit for each peptidomimetic
        macrocycle.
