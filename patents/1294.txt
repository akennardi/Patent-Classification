                                                   ABSTRACT
                           An       apparatus and process is provided for improved asphaltene
separation from heavy hydrocarbon or bitumen with low process complexity through
mass transfer using solvent and counter-current flows, with three sections: an upper
DAO/solid-asphaltene separation zone, a middle solvent mixing and segregation zone,
and a bottom clarification zone. Solvent mixed with heavy hydrocarbon forms a
process feed introduced to the process vessel's upper zone and exposed to counter
current solvent removing DAO from solid asphaltene particles in the feed, the particles
fall through the middle zone and are mixed with introduced solvent, which introduced
solvent segregates DAO-rich solution in the upper zone (for extraction from that zone)
from solvent-rich mixtures in the middle mixing and lower clarification zones. Solvent
flows and precipitate movement are controlled to optimize mass transfer in process,
resulting in high DAO recovery and dry, solid asphaltene product.

      IMPROVED SEPARATION OF SOLID ASPHALTENES FROM HEAVY LIQUID
            HYDROCARBONS USING NOVEL APPARATUS AND PROCESS ("IAS")
This application is a divisional application of Australian application no. 2014221152,
the original disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.
FIELD OF THE INVENTION
                            Process intensification, simplification and improvement of open-art liquid
solid phase separator configurations are described in this specification for an improved
solid asphaltene separator (IAS) device and method. The novel vessel arrangement
and routing of fluids provides an effective, reliable and simple method for separating
precipitated asphaltene solids from solvent/heavy hydrocarbon mixtures in a cost
effective manner, suited for heavy hydrocarbon residue (the "Target Feedstock" for
this invention) from any source such as Canadian Bitumen and particularly for
Canadian Bitumen processed using Canadian Patent #2,764,676 (and US Patent
Application 13/351767).
                            Solvent Deasphalting ("SDA") is a process employed in oil refineries and
upgrading facilities to extract valuable components from residual oil often in an off
stream flow from a prior process operation. The extracted components resulting from
this process can be further processed in refineries where they are cracked and
converted into valuable lighter fractions, such as gasoline and diesel.                      Suitable
residual oil "target feedstocks" which can be used in solvent deasphalting processes
include, for example, atmospheric tower bottoms, vacuum tower bottoms, crude oil,
topped crude oils, coal oil extract, shale oils, and oils recovered from oil sands,
whether by mining or in situ recovery techniques.

DESCRIPTION OF PRIOR ART:
10117601 1 (GHMatters) P100892.AU.1

PRIOR ART SDA SCHEMES:
                            Solvent Deasphalting processes are well known and described, with
many in the open-art, for instance, in Smith's U.S. Pat. No. 2,850,431, Van Pool's U.S.
Pat. No. 3,318,804, King et al's U.S. Pat. No. 3,516,928, Somekh et al's U.S.
Pat. No. 3,714,033, Kosseim et al's U.S. Pat. No. 3,714,034, Yan's U.S. Pat. No.
3,968,023, Beavon's U.S. Pat. No. 4,017,383, Bushnell et al's U.S. Pat. No. 4,125,458,
and Vidueira et al's U.S. Pat. 4,260,476 all of which would benefit from further energy
saving and performance enhancing features that reduce solvent to oil ratio and/or
improve recovery of desired hydrocarbon products. Of note, none of these patents are
suited for separating out an enriched hydrocarbon stream resulting in a precipitated
essentially oil free solid asphaltene stream.
TREATMENT OF SDA GENERATED ASPHALTENE-RICH STREAMS IN THE PRIOR
ART
                            In US Patent # 4,421,639 a SDA process uses a   2 nd asphalt extractor to
concentrate asphaltene material (and recover more deasphalted oil or DAO).                          A
concentrated asphalt stream with added solvent is sent through a heater which raises
the stream's temperature to 425 0 F at 18 psia, and is then sent to a flash drum and
steam stripper to separate solvent (in this case propane) from the asphalt stream.
Resulting asphalt in liquid form is pumped to storage. This arrangement only works if
the asphalt rich stream is liquid at these conditions. It is burdened by plugging if any
appreciable solid asphaltenes are present as would be the case in asphaltene-rich
streams like bitumen and bitumen processed in Canadian Patent #2,764,676; and the
process also has a high solvent volume requirement at industrial scales.
                            In US Patent# 3,847,751, concentrated asphaltenes produced from an
SDA unit are mixed with solvent and transported as a liquid solution into a spray dryer.
The spray nozzle design and pressure drop in the dryer determines the size of liquid
droplets that are formed.                The goal in this dryer is to produce dry, non-sticky solid
asphaltene particles from concentrated liquid asphaltene product and has no effect to
                                                       -2
10117601 1 (GHMatters) P100892.AU.1

separate out DAO from the concentrated liquid asphaltene. Cold gas is added to the
bottom of the spray dryer to enhance cooling by additional convective and conductive
heat transfer, as well as to increase droplet residence time by slowing droplet descent
rate (via upward cooling gas flow) in order to reduce the size of the vessel (which
otherwise would need to be extremely large to provide a long
residence time while droplets dropped).                   This arrangement is not feasible if the
asphaltene particles that have settled out in the extractor are in a solid form in the
solvent at the process operating temperature.                  Solid particles plug the spray drier
nozzle limiting reliability and thus viability of this scheme in solid asphaltene rich
streams.
                            In US Patent# 4,278,529, a process for separating a solvent from a
bituminous material by pressure reduction without carry-over of bituminous material is
disclosed.                A feedstock in a fluid-like phase comprising bituminous material and
solvent undergoes a pressure reduction process by passage through a pressure
reduction valve and is then introduced into a steam stripper. The pressure reduction
process vaporizes part of the solvent and also disperses a mist of fine bituminous
particles in the non-vaporized solvent. The remaining asphaltene remains wet and
sticky and has not enough solvent left to keep the heavy bituminous phase (with many
solids) fluid. In other words, the stream does not maintain a flowable state and clumps
of heavy bituminous particles are formed.
                            In US Patent# 7,597,794, a dispersion solvent is introduced into a liquid
asphalt stream after separation by solvent extraction, and the resulting asphalt solution
undergoes rapid change in a gas-solid separator and is dispersed into solid particles
and solvent vapor, resulting in low temperature separation of asphalt and solvent with
the ability to adjust the size of the resultant asphalt particles.               The challenge with
flash/spray driers such as disclosed here using liquid solvent as a transport media is
the propensity for the asphaltenes generated in the integrated process to remain
wetted before, during and after a flash drying phase. In addition, with this integrated
process, the asphaltene continues to be at elevated temperatures and thus remains
                                                      -3

liquid. This asphalt produced still includes a high level of heavy hydrocarbon. These
asphaltenes stick to surfaces and foul and plug process equipment.                  The reduced
reliability inherent in this approach makes such operations costly for heavy crudes with
high asphaltenic content.
                            US Patent 4,572,781 (Krasuk) discloses a SDA process for separating
substantially dry asphaltenes of high softening point (temperature) from heavy
hydrocarbon material using a two stage co-current process with external mixers and a
first stage centrifugal separator followed by a separate second stage decanter to
separate a liquid phase from a highly concentrated slurry of solid asphaltenes in a
one-way flow of slurry and solvent through the system. This process is designed to
handle a rich asphaltene stream that has solid particles but is a highly costly process
since the separation of the solids is done through a solid/liquid separation with
additional solvent needed to make the material flow to the decanter.                    The solid
material is still relatively wet once separated and needs a further drying step to recover
solvent as a vapour. The recovered solvent vapour then needs to be condensed using
supercritical separation above the solvent critical temperature for re-use, which is
another high energy step adding cost and complexity.                  In addition, the operating
temperature (15-60 0 C) is well below the flow-able point for Heavy hydrocarbon residue
(ex. Canadian Bitumen) unless the solvent to oil mass ratio is over 10:1, which would
make the process very costly to build and operate.
COMMERCIAL SDA SCHEMES IN REFINING AND UPGRADING IN THE PRIOR
ART
                            In US Patent 7,749,378, a ROSE (Residual Oil Supercritical Extraction)
SDA process is applied to an atmospheric residue or vacuum bottoms residue stream
within a refinery or Upgrader. The separated asphaltene-rich stream from the ROSE
SDA unit is a liquid solution which is highly viscous and requires extreme operating
conditions (high temperatures) and added solvent to facilitate feedstock flow through
the process equipment.                   The targeted embodiment of the ROSE SDA process
disclosed requires at least a 4:1 solvent to oil (residue) ratio (by mass) and operating
                                                      -4
10117601 1 (GHMatters) P100892.AU.1

temperatures of the extractor in the range of 300-400 0 F. In commercial practice of the
targeted feedstock, the temperature must be even higher (reaching near critical
conditions) or the solvent flow rate must be increased (up to 12:1 solvent to target
feedstock ratio) in order to keep the asphaltene-rich stream from plugging the process
equipment.                 Regardless, the patent requires the asphaltenes to necessarily remain
dissolved               in the      liquid comprised   of otherwise    valuable heavy   hydrocarbon
components to work as intended.                      In this set up, a large portion of the original
feedstock is downgraded from crude and sent to a low conversion (i.e. coker,
gasification) or low value operation (asphalt plant) reducing the overall economic yield
of the crude (in addition to the relatively high process intensity of the operation).
                            In US Patent 4,200,525, a liquid extraction process (known commercially
as a "Karr" column) is described using counter-flowing liquid phases in a reciprocating
plate extraction column in which the plates of the column are spaced with respect to
one another approximately according to a preconfigured spatial relationship.                    The
extraction column comprises a casing, a reciprocating shaft in the casing having
perforated plates and, optionally, baffle plates mounted thereon in a spatial
relationship with respect to each other and includes motive means and suitable cam
and driving means to reciprocate the shaft.
                            In US Patent 2,493,265 a liquid-liquid extraction column (known
commercially as a "Scheibel" column) is described comprising a substantially vertical
column or chamber provided with a mixing section in which one or more agitators are
installed to promote intimate contact between the liquids so as to approach equilibrium
between them. Above and below the mixing chambers are fibrous packing that stops
the circular motion of the liquids and permits them to separate.
                           The challenge with the co-current, mixer/settler processes in US Patents
4,200,525 and 2,493,265 is being able to run reliably with internal moving parts and
achieving economic yields processing the target feedstock of heavy hydrocarbon
residue (ex. Canadian Bitumen). These mixer/settlers when used industrially will only
                                                         -5
10117601 1 (GHMatters) P100892.AU.1

generate up to 85% of theoretical mass transfer stage due to back-mixing inefficiency.
To achieve higher mass transfer efficiency increased mechanical force and smaller
internal open areas are required which limits the concentration of solids in the column
(<60%) that can be processed reliably precluding the use of these columns in
processing the target feedstock (ex. Canadian Bitumen) that has high viscosity and
has solids generated when in contact with solvent as in Canadian Patent 2,764,676.
                            In US Patent, 4,101,415 a process is described that combines a
traditional liquid-liquid extractor with a second stage liquid-solid separator.                      It is
disclosed that the performance of a counter-current contactor can be improved by
using a second separation stage to separate solid asphaltenes.                      It is clear that this
separation is effected at high pressures (550 psig), high temperatures (over 500 0 F)
and high solvent to oil ratios of 40:1. At these conditions, separators will be extremely
large. The process is oriented towards processing lube oil stocks with reduced fouling
tendencies and is generally limited to low or moderate yields of deasphalted oil,
negatively impacting the economics if applied to target feedstocks.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
                            It is to be understood that other aspects of the present invention will
become readily apparent to those skilled in the art from the following detailed
description, wherein various embodiments of the invention are shown and described
by way of illustration. As will be realized, the invention is capable of being practiced
with other and different embodiments and its several details are capable of
modification in various other respects, all without departing from the spirit and scope of
the present invention described here and limited by the claims.                        Accordingly the
drawings and detailed description are to be regarded as illustrative in nature and not
as restrictive.
                           An improved asphaltene separator (IAS) has been developed to support
a continuous, reliable process to generate an essentially oil-free solid asphaltene by
product stream thus enabling a high DAO recovery and yield economically. The IAS
with three sections and pumparound scheme provides the necessary separation,
mixing, and counter-current mass transfer in a single vessel arrangement without the
requirement for internal mass transfer or mixing devices. The vessel has specific
geometry to mitigate the settling and plugging of solid asphaltenes in the vessel.
                           The present invention provides an improved asphaltene separation
process, comprising the steps:
              a.           A target feedstock is mixed with a Solvent;
              b.           The feedstock/solvent mix is introduced near to the top of a Separator
                            having three parts in fluid communication, spaced vertically:
                            i.      An upper section
                            ii.     A middle section, and
                            iii.    A lower section;
              c.            Fresh solvent is introduced to the middle section;
              d.            Fresh solvent is introduced to the lower portion of the lower section;
                                                          -7
10117601 1 (GHMatters) P100892.AU.1

              e.           A DAO-rich solvent/DAO solution is removed from near the top of the
                            upper section; and
             f.            A slurry of particulate asphaltene solid precipitate and solvent is removed
                            at an outlet near or at the bottom of the lower section;
             g.            The removed slurry of particulate asphaltene solid precipitate and
                            solvent is processed in a low temperature inertial separator unit (ISU)
                            creating a dry solid asphaltene stream and a recovered solvent stream;
                            and
             h.            The DAO-rich solvent/DAO stream is sent to a stripping unit to create a
                           product DAO stream and a recovered stream.
                           The present invention also provides an improved solid asphaltene
separator apparatus comprising:
              a.           An upper section which comprises
                            i.      Means to receive a mixture of target feedstock and a solvent;
                            ii.     Means to remove DAO rich DAO/solvent mixture;
                            iii.    Means to remove solid asphaltene suspension; and
              b.           A middle section
                            i.      Operatively connected with the upper and lower section with
                            ii.     Means to receive fresh solvent for
                                    1.    Mixing to provide additional mass transfer in the middle
                                          section;
                                    2.    Providing sufficient solvent flow to the upper section to
                                          provide     additional mass    transfer,   and  prevent  the
                                          downward flow of DAO while permitting the downward flow
                                          of materials comprised essentially of solid asphaltene
                                          precipitate;
                                    3.    Some downward flow of solvent; and
              c.           A lower section
                                                           -8
10117601 1 (GHMatters) P100892.AU.1

                            i.      Operatively connected      with the    middle section to   receive
                                    downward flows of solvent introduced in the middle section and to
                                    receive downward flow of solid asphaltene precipitate from the
                                    upper section through the middle section and into the lower
                                    section with:
                                    1.     Means to receive fresh solvent at or near the bottom of the
                                           lower section with solvent flow rates sufficient to be
                                           counter-current to downward flow of the materials from the
                                           upper section; and
                                    2.     Means to remove the solid asphaltenes from the downward
                                           flowing materials together with some solvent.
                           The proposed design has 3 distinct sections within one vessel providing
specific process objectives to create an oil-free solid asphaltene without the need for
internal mass transfer devices. The upper section is a primary DAO/ solid asphaltene
separation zone with asphaltene de-entrainment via temperature gradient above feed
and up to one mass transfer stage via counter current flow below feed. The middle
section injects fresh solvent for complete mixing with downward flowing solid
asphaltenes while segregating the upper and lower sections by limiting the downward
flow of essentially all the DAO from the upper section and simultaneously permitting
downward travel of the solid asphaltenes through the middle section and into the lower
section. The lower section is a primary clarification zone for the asphaltene solids with
up to one mass transfer stage achieved from counter current upward flow of solvent
introduced at the bottom of the lower section.                     With a preferred described vessel
arrangement, fresh solvent injection points at the bottom of the lower section and at
the middle section and a "pumparound" of solvent from the top of the lower section to
the feed of the upper section to promote counter-current solvent flow within the system
solvent interaction is maximized with the "Target Feedstock" reducing the overall
solvent to oil ratio requirements.

                            By using a variety of lighter hydrocarbon mixtures as a solvent an
essentially oil-free solid asphaltene stream can be generated in the proposed device
and process scheme to create a high yield deasphalted oil (DAO) stream from a target
feedstock like heavy asphaltene-rich hydrocarbon residue (ex. Canadian Bitumen).
DESCRIPTION OF VARIOUS EMBODIMENTS
                           The detailed description set forth below in connection with the appended
drawings is intended as a description of various embodiments of the present invention
and is not intended to represent the only embodiments contemplated by the inventors.
The detailed description includes specific details for the purpose of providing a
comprehensive understanding of the present invention. However, it will be apparent to
those skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without these
specific details.
                            Known methods of countercurrent liquid-liquid extraction of mixtures are
generally of two types.                 The first type is designated as the batch countercurrent
multiple contact method and employs a multiple of one-stage steps.                        It requires an
apparatus consisting of a multiple of separate, external and alternate mixing and
settling units connected by pipes and pumps to circulate the liquids. A pair of mixing
and settling steps is known as a "stage" with solvent and separated components
passing in opposite directions (counter current flow).                      In this arrangement, large
quantities of equipment are required.                    Many pumps, tanks, agitators, mixers, and
vessels with internals (static and mechanical) are needed requiring a lot of capital
investment including a lot of plot space to operate. The second type is more readily
practiced and is carried out by allowing the liquids to flow continuously and counter
currently in a chamber filled with various types of objects, whether static or
mechanical, to provide better contact between a lighter rising liquid and a heavier
settling liquid in the same chamber.
                           The concept illustrated in this patent application is a novel combination of
the two types of liquid-liquid extraction methods to better suit the requirements of
                                                        -10

processing heavy asphaltene-rich crudes like the "Target Feedstock" (ex. heavy
hydrocarbon residue and Canadian Bitumen) that have precipitated asphaltene solids
in their process by providing a counter-current liquid-solid separator to recover more
higher value hydrocarbons. The number of units is reduced when compared to the
batch countercurrent method, and no internals (which are prone to plugging in this
service) are needed through the use of a pumparound stream to maximize the use of
solvent and maintain the crude within a specially designed three section single vessel.
The design for the new separator is aimed to provide continuous, reliable operation
providing a very high DAO recovery, with solid asphaltenes produced having a very
low DAO content.
                            Mass transfer is a key design parameter for the process using the mixer
500 and the IAS and was determined to set the economic dimensions for the process
using the mixer 500 and IAS and operating conditions to obtain acceptable levels of
DAO recovery.                       Table 1 provides the relationship between mass transfer, noted as
extraction stages, and the amount of DAO remaining as part of the solid asphaltenes
when processing the "Target Feedstock". The mixer provides the first stage of mass
transfer while the IAS provides two additional stages of mass transfer plus the required
component separation.

                            Based on testing as illustrated in table 1, and validation in a 5 BPD pilot
plant, recovery of DAO above 99wt% can be achieved which results in the DAO in

asphaltene to be at most 5wt%. To achieve the high recovery of DAO in this process,
at least two to three stages of mass transfer may be needed.                      Essentially all of the
recovered DAO is removed from the upper section with essentially all of the cleaned
solid asphaltenes removed from the bottom of the lower section.                         In continuous
operations multiple stages of mass transfer may be achieved economically in counter
current flow columns with the solvent travelling upward in the column in a plug flow
nature, with increasing DAO concentration as it travels up the column. The IAS has
three distinct sections, as shown in Figure 1 providing over two mass transfer stages
to meet the specific process objectives:
1.         Upper Section -               primary DAO/asphaltene separation zone at vessel inlet
           location
                            a)      At Inlet - separate near-equilibrium DAO/solvent solution and
                                    solid asphaltene in suspension from Mixer 500;
                            b)      Above inlet location- potential for asphaltene suppression to
                                    prevent carry over;
                            c)      Below feed location- mass transfer via counter current flow as the
                                    solid asphaltene settles from the suspension.
2.         Middle Section - Inject fresh solvent for thorough mixing of downward flowing
           solid asphaltenes with clean solvent, mass transfer, and segregation of the rich
           DAO/solvent solution in the upper section from the lean DAO/solvent solution in
           the lower section while permitting asphaltene solids to drop from the upper to the
           lower section.
3.         Lower Section - primarily a clarification zone - mass transfer via counter current
           upward solvent flow and downward asphaltene flow.
                           The upper section will separate the bulk of the DAO from the solid
asphaltenes leaving up to approximately 10% of DAO in the DAO/asphaltene/solvent
mix that settles to the mixing zone. This section of the IAS is configured so that the
                                                         - 12

entering material has adequate volume to settle and separate into its respective
"phases"/components (solvent/DAO solution and solid asphaltene precipitants in
suspension) but without creating solvent mal-distribution.                  The lighter DAO/solvent
mixture will travel upward with solvent introduced from the middle section and the
heavier solid asphaltenes-rich suspension will settle downward through a solvent rich
zone in this upper section.
                           An alternate embodiment of this upper section when less mass transfer
is desired can be a typical hydrocyclone configuration for solid-liquid separation.
Examples of possible hydrocyclone arrangements are US PAT#'s 6540918 and
8252179B2 that describe separation of suspended solids from a liquid.                      A further
alternate embodiment could be an enhanced liquid-liquid hydrocyclone as noted in US
PAT# 5667686 that could be applied to this solid-liquid separation.
                           As illustrated in Figure 2, a benefit of a top (downward) inlet feed of a
preferred embodiment is good axial distribution in the vessel for downward flowing
feed with the upward flowing solvent.                      Another embodiment for the main target
feedstock/solvent feed provides a side entry into the column (ex. direct or tangential),
as shown in Figure 3, which is a neutral entry locus that provides the fastest
disengagement/separation of the two "phases"/components so the vessel can provide
further mass transfer (below the feed) and asphaltene carryover suppression (above
the feed). The design trade-off between top and side feed is the processing volume of
the vessel required for mass transfer and distribution of the feed.                  A top feed will
typically require more vessel height to achieve the same process objectives as a side
feed without considering any additional internal devices.
                            For the side feed configuration, space in the vessel above the main feed
is provided to allow for an upper temperature gradient which can be used to mitigate
asphaltene carryover to the next section. The temperature gradient (-15
20 0 F) is set to slightly reverse the solubility of the solvent so that the heavier
components of the upward flowing DAO precipitate out and agglomerate with the solid
asphaltenes so the solid asphaltenes are heavy enough to flow back downward. This
                                                        -13
10117601 1 (GHMatters) P100892.AU.1

internal flow cycle encourages agglomeration of smaller solid asphaltene particles into
larger particles with sufficient mass to overcome the counter flow in order to travel
back downwards toward the lower section.
                           The middle section can be configured with a single tangential or radial
nozzle or several nozzles to provide thorough mixing and "washing" of the asphaltenes
through the injection at those nozzles of clean solvent to further reduce the amount of
DAO in the downward flowing solid asphaltene-rich mixture, and stop downward flow
of DAO/solvent mixture from the upper section to the lower section while permitting the
downward migration of precipitated asphaltene particles. The geometry of the vessel
in this section and the nozzle orientation/placement provides optimal mixing with the
solvent within this middle section. As a preferred embodiment noted in Figure 4, three
nozzles are arranged and sized to provide good solvent and solid asphaltene/DAO
contact by mixing thereby reducing the overall solvent requirements since essentially
all the solvent in this section is mixed with the downward flowing solid asphaltenes. In
an embodiment, the design has no need for internal devices or projections that could
reduce the overall effectiveness of the mixing zone by disrupting the flow patterns in
the vessel and this reduces chances for fouling and material buildup. Mixing in this
section aims to fully mix the downward flowing solid asphaltenes and any remaining
small amounts of DAO with introduced solvent while still allowing the asphaltene solids
to travel downward, while the counter-current upward solvent flow from the middle
section to the upper section prevents downward migration of DAO from the upper
section.             The flow of solid asphaltenes downward via gravity can be tailored by
modulating the volume and rate of introduced solvent in this section.              Similarly, any
downward flow of DAO/solvent mixture from the upper section can be controlled by the
volume and rate of solvent introduced in the middle section.
                           This middle section provides further mass transfer and provides a
counter current effect for solvent to contact downward flowing solid asphaltene and
entrained DAO within the upper segment of the middle section. Contact with clean
solvent in this mixing zone provides further DAO absorption in the upward flowing
                                                    - 14

solvent. The diameter of this section is preferably smaller than the upper section
(preferably less than 25% of the upper vessel diameter) so that solvent can be injected
to ensure upward counter-current flows, and desired mixing and thus washing, without
the need for any internal separation and solvent distribution devices. The length of
this section is noted by A in figure 1 and can be anywhere from 3" to hundreds of feet
in length.
                            Figure 4 shows a conceptual arrangement of the injection nozzles in the
washing zone of the middle section.                   Simple solvent flows at nozzle elevation are
shown based on basic computational fluid dynamic (CFD) analysis. Three nozzles are
used in an embodiment on one side of the vessel to create a well-developed, mildly
turbulent mix of solvent with downward flowing solid asphaltenes.                    A simple valve
manifold on one side of the vessel can be installed with appropriate flow meters and
controls. There are minimal poor mixing zones, noted as filled in circles in Fig. 4.
                           The lower section of the IAS is essentially a clarification zone with
asphaltene solids settling downward by gravity against an upward or counter-current
(to the asphaltene solids) solvent flow. A larger diameter than the middle section is
designed to tailor the settling velocity of the solids to be greater than the upward
flowing velocity of introduced solvent to minimize upward flowing solid asphaltenes.
Clarification zones in similar applications typically have long and wide sections to allow
adequate time to settle the cleaned solids in a laminar flow. The clarification section is
included to provide additional mass transfer with the solids settling rate being a crucial
design parameter.                   Including the mass transfer from this section, the overall mass
transfer for the mixer 500 and vessel 100 is greater than 2 stages.
                            Downward flowing solid asphaltene is fed into the lower section (from the
upper section via the middle section) providing good axial distribution in the
vessel for the downward flowing solid suspension in the upward flowing solvent. In an
embodiment, nozzles are spaced in the conical portion of the lower section
(clarification zone) to serve as solvent injection locations, from stream 11 in figures 2
                                                       -15

and 3, to limit solids agglomeration,                          bridging, and  overall solid  asphaltene
accumulation in the bottom of the vessel, thereby ensuring mobilization of the solids.
                           All bottom portions of each section will either be a straight connection or
should ideally have walls, as noted as sections 4 and 5 in figure 1, with angles of
incline greater than 550 but preferably steeper, nearer 750 from horizontal to improve
reliable operation. These angles allow for gravity to help reduce on-wall settling of
particles and removes locations within the column where solids can accumulate.
                            Figure 2 shows an application of the improved solid asphaltene
separator (IAS) device unit 100, with a simple process flow diagram and mass balance
around the three section vessel. A pumparound (reflux) configuration may be provided
in a preferred embodiment to reduce the overall use of solvent with greater than two
stages of solvent extraction/separation,                        and provides a novel and economic
arrangement. Balancing solvent flows into and out of the lower section via the intake
nozzles and the reflux outlet with solvent introduced in the middle section provides a
means of modulating and controlling the solvent's upward, counter-current flow in the
lower section.                    Similarly, adding relatively clean solvent, preferably taken from the
lower section via the reflux circuit, to the middle of the upper section, and also
controlling rates of introduced feedstock/solvent blend and removing DAO/solvent
mixture, with control of the fresh solvent volume introduced in the middle section
provides a means of modulating and controlling the solvent's upward, counter-current
flow in the upper section. These flow controls principally in the middle section act to
segregate the DAO in the upper section from the lower section.
                            Based on the representative mass balance of Figures 2 and 3, the
overall solvent to oil mass ratio (SOR) is 3:1 as noted in table 2a, in an embodiment.
The local SOR's are 2.7 in the separation zone in the upper section, and 9.7 for both
the mixing (middle section) and clarification (lower section) zones.                          Based on
experimental results, as shown in table 2b, the SOR's can be in the 2.5-4 range for the
separation zone in the upper section, in the 5-10 range for the mixing zone and in the
3-10 range for the clarification zone in the lower section.                   By using the pumparound
                                                           -16
10117601 1 (GHMatters) P100892.AU.1

and the dual injection concepts, the mixing and clarification SOR's can be substantially
higher than the overall SOR while still having an overall low SOR for the entire
process.

                            Clean solvent in stream 2, collected from recovered solvent streams
6,7,12 and 13, is distributed to the 3 section vessel in two locations via stream 10 and
11. Clean solvent in stream 10 is injected at the second injection point into the mixing
zone in the middle section while clean solvent from stream 11 is injected at the third
injection point into the bottom of the clarification zone in the lower section creating
counter current, upward solvent flow in the IAS vessel. Pumps 800 and 900 with the
associated flowmeters and control valves (not shown) can be used to control the flows
of solvent to the vessel as shown in Figure 2. The stream 10 at the second injection
point in the middle section breaks the single solvent/DAO gradient typically found in
counter-current column arrangements forcing a new DAO solubility limit (or equilibrium
point) in the middle section and where DAO is better absorbed into the solvent in the
bottom portion of the upper section of the vessel and thereby

enhancing the mass transfer provided with this configuration.                         This flow also
discourages downward flow of DAO from the upper section while permitting the solid
asphaltenes to drop into lower section.
                            In an embodiment, the target feedstock of heavy hydrocarbon "oil" (i.e.
heavy hydrocarbon residue (ex. Canadian Bitumen) or reactor bottoms from Canadian
patent #2,764,676 processing Canadian bitumen and similar processes) is fed through
stream 1 and is mixed with the pumparound solvent in stream 14 which contains
solvent and trace amounts of DAO from the lower section (clarification zone of the
vessel) to wash any remaining DAO on or near the solid asphaltenes.                         In another
embodiment, stream 1 can be mixed with clean or recycled/refreshed solvent, for
example from stream 10.
                           The lean solvent from the clarification zone in the lower section from
stream 4 is not fully saturated with DAO and can serve as an initial solvent for mixing
with the Target Feedstock from stream 1. As stated above, clean solvent in stream 10
is added to replace the removed stream 4 pumparound solvent in the column to
enhance mass transfer. The pumparound solvent stream 4 is passed through pump
300 and heater 400 to create the necessary operating conditions to promote complete
mixing with the initial feed stream 1. A mixer 500, which can be a static or shear
mixer, is employed to ensure complete mixing of feed stream 3 so the mixture can
reach its solubility limit (equilibrium or close to 1 mass transfer stage) and thus
generate solid precipitation of asphaltenes before entering the vessel 100.
                           A top feed entry for stream 3 is shown in figure 2, while a side feed entry
for stream 3 is illustrated in Figure 3. A rich DAO/solvent product leaves the top of the
upper section of the vessel as stream 5 while the solid asphaltenes flow downward
within the vessel to the middle mixing section where clean solvent from stream 10 is
injected to promote mixing and washing of the downward flowing solid asphaltenes to
remove remaining DAO.                   The introduction of solvent in the middle section is also
designed to reduce downward flow of DAO/solvent mixture from the
                                                       -18

upper section while permitting downward movement of precipitated solid asphaltenes,
by ensuring appropriate countercurrent flow of solvent.
                           The produced rich DAO/solvent stream 5 is sent to a solvent stripping
unit 200 where DAO product stream 8 is produced along with a clean solvent stream
6. The solvent stripping unit can be a sub-critical separation in this arrangement due
to the lower solvent volumes needed further reducing the overall cost for the process
because less costly equipment material is needed due to the lower pressure flange
classes used and because of reduced energy requirements.                      The solvent may be
condensed in condenser 600 and then become liquid stream 7 for reuse in the
process.
                           The middle section (mixing zone) with clean solvent from stream 10 will
have an SOR of approximately 5-10:1. Upward flowing solvent from the mixing zone
serves to induce counter current flow and a different solvent gradient in the upper
section of the separator, and mixes with the feedstream 1, resulting in the upper
section having an SOR of approximately 2.5-4:1.                    The solid asphaltenes continue
falling downward through the middle section to the lower section's clarification zone.
                            Lean solvent with recovered DAO is removed at the top of the lower
section (clarification zone), noted as stream 4, in an embodiment, using a pumparound
to regulate flow so that the clarification zone in the lower section maintains an upward
flow of solvent throughout but permits a downward flow of settling solid asphaltenes.
The clarification zone SOR will in a preferred embodiment be in the range of 3.0-10:1.
As noted previously, fresh solvent is added through stream 11, preferably in the
conical portion of the lower section.                Nozzles are placed in this conical portion to
ensure thorough contact and distribution of the upward solvent flow with the downward
flowing solid asphaltenes.                  The essentially oil-free solid asphaltene and some
entrained solvent leave the lower section of the vessel as stream 9.                         In an
embodiment, stream 9 enters a simple, low cost inertial separation unit (ISU) 300 to
separate flashed solvent as stream 12, typically from a pressure reduction, to leave
stream 20 a dry, solid particulate asphaltene. The solvent is

                          The invention of this application is better than what is illustrated under
US Patent# 4,572,781 by Krasuk et al (Krasuk). The DAO recovery is over 99%. In
addition, the solvent use of this invention is 25% less than Krasuk and requires less
equipment to accomplish better performance goals which typically results in a lower
cost and more economically favourable process. The comparison in table 3 was done
using the crude properties shown in table 4.

                          The crude feedstock into Krasuk is actually a topped stream with the
lighter crude fractions removed (whole Jobo crude API is                          -   9-11). The target
feedstock for this invention, such as Athabasca bitumen, has more, heavier
asphaltenes than Jobo. The API's and % asphaltenes are comparable between the
two crude streams but the Athabasca asphaltenes are heavier and thus more difficult
to process.                 It is probable that the Krasuk process would not be as effective in
processing Athabasca bitumen as for topped Jobo crude due to the complexity of the
Athabasca asphaltenes. Illustration A illustrates the difference in asphaltene structure
between Athabasca bitumen and the Jobo crude used by Krasuk.                                 Likely, the
Athabasca based bitumen structure has more locations for DAO molecules to adhere
to the asphaltene molecule making it more difficult to disengage the DAO to obtain
desired DAO recovery. Even with a more difficult oil to process, vessel 100 and the
process of this invention with the dual solvent injection and, in an embodiment, a
pumparound stream provides a better DAO recovery with simpler equipment.

                       Krasuk described a process which as its end-product delivered dry
asphaltene solids with, as in his best example, >10% included DAO by weight. This
invention is capable of delivery of dry asphaltene solids with very small particle sizes
and with included DAO of under 5wt%. The solid asphaltenes delivered are therefore
quite different in their characteristics, and in addition, the invention of this application
delivers an increased volume of valuable DAO hydrocarbons removed from the
precipitated asphaltenes.
                       Krasuk's process describes a sequence of two segregated solvent
washes operating co-currently.                          This means that the Krasuk invention with the two
segregated washes has more pumping complexity, uses much more fresh solvent, and
much differently configured/sized sequential wash vessels, and results in a solid
asphaltene            product         with    different       characteristics  (higher    included     DAO and
consequential handling and economics), and less overall liquid hydrocarbon recovery.

                           A further embodiment of the    IAS vessel of this invention with
pumparound arrangement when processing Target Feedstock hydrocarbon residue
(ex. Canadian Bitumen) is to be integrated with an upstream thermal cracking
operation such as described in US Patent# 7976695 and as illustrated in Canadian
Patent #2,764,676. The concentration of solid asphaltenes in the feed to the mixer
500 in front of the IAS in this preferred embodiment can be 33.5% (to approximately as
high as 50%) with the feed stream 1 (having an API in the -2 to 5 range after the
lighter portions of the bitumen have been separated in the upstream thermal cracker).
These ranges of acceptable asphaltene concentrations in the Target Feedstock are
approximately 3 times more than allowed or discussed in the Krasuk feed. The DAO
recovery is as good as the Krasuk invention with less DAO left in the produced solid
asphaltene and has essentially the same solvent to oil ratio while processing a heavier
and more asphaltene-rich feedstock.              In addition, the operating conditions for the
Krasuk patent would prevent the target feedstock of this invention from flowing in and
through the vessels of Krasuk. The IAS and pumparound arrangement successfully
processes this target feedstock as noted in table 5.

DEFINITIONS
The following terms are used in this document with the following meanings.            This
section is meant to aid in clarifying the applicant's intended meaning.
A slurry is, in general, a thick suspension of solids in a liquid.
In chemistry, a suspension is a heterogeneous fluid containing solid particles that are
sufficiently large for sedimentation.    Suspensions are classified on the basis of the
dispersed phase and the dispersion medium, where the former is essentially solid
while the latter may either be a solid, a liquid, or a gas.
In chemistry, a solution is a homogeneous mixture composed of only one phase. In
such a mixture, a solute is dissolved in another substance, known as a solvent.
An emulsion is a mixture of small globules of one liquid into a second liquid with which
the first will not dissolve.
Precipitation is the process of separating a substance from a solution as a solid.
Process intensification is the replacement or combination of separate operating units
into one unit improving the overall performance of the process. Similarly, process
intensity expresses a relative concept for comparing a combination of complexity,
capital intensity and operational expense factors for processes or facilities.
Canadian Bitumen is a form of petroleum that exists in the semi-solid or solid phase in
natural deposits. Bitumen is a thick, sticky form of crude oil, having a viscosity greater
than 10,000 centipoises under reservoir conditions, an API gravity of less than 100 API
and typically contains over 15wt% asphaltenes.
Some Liquid-Liquid extraction terms:

10117601 1 (GHMatters) P100892.AU.1

Continuous Phase - The continuous phase is one of the two immiscible phases in an
extraction tower. The continuous phase flows through the extractor as a continuum,
rather than as dispersed droplets. In our process, the solvent should be considered
the continuous phase and flows upwards.
Dispersed Phase - The dispersed phase is one of the two immiscible phases which
are contacted in an extraction tower.             It flows through the extractor as droplets
purposely dispersed in the second (continuous) phase.
Entrainment - Entrainment refers to the presence of droplets of one of the liquid phase
(in this case solid asphaltenes) in the other phase after a separation zone in the tower.
Two critical separation zones are the upper and the lower of the column, where the
two phases disengage before leaving the column.
Equilibrium contact - means to promote intimate contact between the liquids.
Extract - The extract is the stream leaving an extraction tower which consists of
solvent and the compounds (DAO) extracted from the feed by the solvent. It is also
known as rich solvent.              It may also be referred to as the "extract solution" to
differentiate it from the "extract product" which is produce by separating the solvent
from the extracted components in a secondary separation step (i.e. two-stage
stripping).
Raffinate - The raffinate is the stream leaving an extraction tower which consists of
the feed components not extracted by the solvent (i.e. asphaltenes and residual DAO).
Theoretical Stage - A theoretical stage is the equivalent of a single contacting zone in
which the concentrations in the liquid (and solid) phases leaving the zone are in
equilibrium.
Flooding - Flooding is a condition caused by the operation of the extraction tower at
dispersed or continuous phase flow rates exceeding the capacity of the column.
Typically, flooding is evidenced by a significant buildup of dispersed phase within the
extractor and/or by excessive entrainment.

10117601 1 (GHMatters) P100892.AU.1

Mass transfer- Mass transfer is the spontaneous, irreversible transfer of mass of a
given component in a space with a nonuniform field of chemical potential of the
component.
Mass Transfer Stage - A mass transfer stage is a discrete point where mass transfer
occurs to approach equilibrium. Multiple stages can be continuously coupled to reach
a desired separation quality.
Washing - Washing is the thorough contact of solvent to remove DAO that surrounds
asphaltene solid particles.

such reference does not constitute an admission that the publication forms a part of
the common general knowledge in the art, in Australia or any other country.
                            In the claims which follow and in the preceding description of the
invention, except where the context requires otherwise due to express language or
necessary implication, the word "comprise" or variations such as "comprises" or
"comprising" is used in an inclusive sense, i.e. to specify the presence of the stated
features but not to preclude the presence or addition of further features in various
embodiments of the invention.

CLAIMS:
1.                         An Improved Asphaltene Separation process, comprising the steps:
             a.            A target feedstock is mixed with a Solvent;
              b.           The feedstock/solvent mix is introduced near to the top of a Separator
                            having three parts in fluid communication, spaced vertically:
                            i.      An upper section

             c.             Fresh solvent is introduced to the middle section;
             d.             Fresh solvent is introduced to the lower portion of the lower section;
             e.            A DAO-rich solvent/DAO solution is removed from near the top of the
                            upper section; and
             f.            A slurry of particulate asphaltene solid precipitate and solvent is removed
                           at an outlet near or at the bottom of the lower section
             g.            The removed slurry of particulate asphaltene solid precipitate and
                           solvent is processed in a low temperature inertial separator unit (ISU)
                           creating a dry solid asphaltene stream and a recovered solvent stream;
                           and
             h.            The DAO-rich solvent/DAO stream is sent to a stripping unit to create a
                            product DAO stream and a recovered stream.
2.                         The process of claim 1 where movement of the asphaltene solid
precipitate through the Separator is modulated by controlling solvent flows:

             a.             In the upper section where there is sufficient solvent/mixture interaction
                           to provide substantial removal of DAO from the precipitate, movement of
                           the      precipitant is     controlled  by balancing   solvent inflow of the
                           feedstock/solvent mix and clean solvent from the middle section against
                           the solvent outflow in the DAO-rich solvent/DAO removal while permitting
                           the precipitated asphaltene solid particles to drop by gravity through the
                            upper section to the middle section;
              b.            In the middle section, solvent is added with sufficient volume, force and
                            directed flow to:
                            i.        Provide some upward flow of clean solvent into the upper section,
                                      sufficient to discourage downward flow through the middle section
                                      of DAO/solvent mixture while insufficient to discourage downward
                                      movement through         the middle  section of solid asphaltene
                                      precipitate particles;
                            ii.       Provide thorough mixing in the middle section of clean solvent
                                     with downward falling solid asphaltene precipitate particles; and
                            iii.      Provide solvent inflow to the lower section co-current with the dry
                                      solid asphaltene particles; and
              c.            In the lower section, solvent is added near the bottom of this section with
                            sufficient volume to control some counter-current solvent flow in a solid
                            asphaltene slurry formed as the solid asphaltene precipitate particles fall
                           to the bottom of the process vessel, and to provide enough solvent to
                            enable the slurry to be produced from the outlet at or near the bottom of

3.                         The process of either claim 1 or 2 with a controlled outflow through an
outlet in the upper sidewall of the lower section for removal of lean solvent from the
lower section.

4.                         The process of claim 2 with the added flow control step of also
controlling the outflow of lean solvent from the lower section.
5.                         The process of claim 2 where opportunities for mass transfer to remove
DAO from                   solid asphaltene precipitate are increased by providing increased
solvent/solid contact, which is done by controlling:
             a.             Mixing effects in the middle section by controlling at least one of: solvent
                            in-flow volumes, force or direction;
              b.            Mixing effects in the vessel by controlling counter-current solvent flows;
                           and
             c.             Duration of washing of asphaltene particles by solvent by controlling
                           solvent flows and counter-flows, and asphaltene downward drop rates
                           through the vessel.
6.                         The process of any one of the preceding claims in which as a result of
the mixing of target feedstock and solvent at step (a), a dry asphaltene solid is
precipitated so that the feedstock/solvent mix introduced to the Separator at step (b)
comprises:
             a.            Solvent/DAO solution
              b.           Solid asphaltene suspension
7.                         The process of Claim 3, where solvent used to mix with the target
feedstock is taken from the controlled outlet that removes lean solvent from an upper
part of the lower section and that lean solvent is introduced to the target feedstock
prior to the mixture entering the separator.
8.                         The process of Claim 3, where a lean solvent mixture comprised of DAO
recovered from the precipitate in the lower section and solvent is recovered at or near
                                                         -31

prior to the mixture entering the separator.
9.                         The process of any one of the preceding claims where the solids settling
rate is such that <10 wt% of the solid asphaltene in the target feedstock is entrained
with the DAO-rich solvent/DAO product through the middle section.
10.                        The process of any one of the preceding claims where the overall mass
solvent to oil ratio is < 4:1.
11.                        The process of any one of the preceding claims where the Solvent to oil
ratio in the separation zone of the upper section is < 4:1.
12.                        The process of any one of the preceding claims where the Solvent to oil
ratio in the mixing zone in the middle section is < 10:1.
13.                        The process of any one of the preceding claims where the Solvent to oil
ratio in lower zone is < 10:1.
14.                        The process of any one of the preceding claims where the %DAO in the
lean solvent of a pumparound stream is < 1.0%.
15.                        The process of any one of the preceding claims where the % DAO in the
solid product asphaltene is less than 5wt%.
