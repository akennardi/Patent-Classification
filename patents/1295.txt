                                         ABSTRACT
        A system and method are provided for managing electrical power usage. During a
predetermined time period, such as during blackout conditions, a digital signal processor
(DSP) controls an IGBT/FET-based device to supply an allocated amount of power. When
the consumed amount of power exceeds the allocated amount, the DSP shuts off the power.
Alternatively, the system provides a signal to reduce the consumed power. If sufficient load
has not been reduced after a predetermined amount of time, the power is shut off. Further
alternatively or in addition, the DSP may shut off power to predetermined electrical outlets,
while providing power to other electrical outlets, to reduce the power usage to the
predetermined amount. During other time periods, the DSP controls the IGBT/FET device to
provide a predetermined voltage that is less than the AC incoming line voltage. When the
voltage drops below the predetermined voltage, such as during brownout conditions, a
microprocessor controls an electronic switch on the primary windings side of a transformer
system to provide a boosted output voltage.

                       SYSTEM AND METHOD TO MANAGE POWER USAGE
                                  BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
[0001]          1.    Field of the Invention
[0002]          This invention relates to the management of electrical power usage.
[0003]         2.     Description of the Related Art
[0004]          Since the industrial revolution, the world's consumption of energy has grown at a
steady rate. Most power generated and energy consumed is from the combustion of fossil
fuels, which is a non-renewable natural resource that is rapidly becoming depleted. As the
depletion of Earth's natural resources continues, power generation and energy conservation
has become an increasingly important issue with governments in both this country and
abroad. In addition, businesses and consumers are also concerned as the costs for such
resources are rapidly increasing.
[0005]         Not only do there exist worldwide concerns with power generation and energy
conservation, but there also exist concerns with power distribution, especially in emerging
economies. Although power generation and energy conservation are of great importance, the
problem of power distribution is also of great concern as it involves existing infrastructure
919233.6/SPH/18175/0128/020711

that is usually inadequate for properly distributing power. Moreover, it is not readily suitable
to be improved upon.
[0006]     Electricity for residential and industrial use is typically generated at an electric
power generating station, and sent through transmission lines in an electricity grid to a
distribution system, which carries the electricity to the consumer. In many parts of the world,
electric power supply has not kept up with demand, often resulting in brownouts, and
sometimes blackouts. A brownout is a drop in voltage in the electrical power supply, often
resulting in dimming of lighting when the voltage sags. Brownout voltages sometimes drop
enough to cause appliances or equipment to stop operating. Such appliances or equipment
may sustain permanent damage as a result of the low voltage condition.
[0007]     In extreme occurrences of electric power demand exceeding supply, blackouts may
occur. A blackout occurs when the supply voltage cannot be sustained at all, or is reduced to
a dangerously low level, such as to cause electric motors to stall and overheat. The times of
blackouts are generally known to the electrical company from historical records of heavy
demand.
[0008]     A brownout may be caused by (1) inadequate power generation, (2) insufficient
power transmission capacity, and/or (3) insufficient power distribution capacity. Inadequate
                                                    2

power generation and insufficient power transmission are easier to remedy than insufficient
power distribution capacity. Both power generation demand and power transmission capacity
can be calculated and fulfilled comparatively easily within fiscal budgets.
[0009]      The main obstacle to providing sufficient power to consumers is insufficient power
distribution capacity. The need for power distribution capacity cannot be easily planned for
or economically implemented. Moreover, as the world population grows, and industrial
participation in the world economy increases, the power distribution infrastructure will be
increasingly strained or overloaded by the additional loads placed on it. The distribution
problems can often be attributed to copper losses within the cabling that forms the
distribution infrastructure.
[0010]      Currently, governmental entities and power companies attempt to remedy brown
out occurrences by elevating the AC voltage or adding power shedding generation at
appropriate locations on the power grid. This method usually results in a wide disparity of
voltages available to consumers in homes and/or business. The voltage increases may range
from ten percent to fifteen percent (10%-15%) and, since power is calculated by
Voltage 2/load, the result of the governmental entities' and power companies' "remedy" can
                                                  3

result in increased charges to the consumer of up to twenty-five percent (25%). Thus, rather
than conserving energy, governmental entities and power companies are expending energy.
[0011]      Furthermore, although most appliances and equipment used in businesses and
homes are capable of performing, exactly to specification, at the nominal voltage minus ten
percent (10%), most energy savings devices do not exploit this feature. Thus, a further
potential for energy savings is oftentimes ignored.
[0012]      A transformer transfers electrical energy from one circuit to another through
inductively coupled conductors. A varying current in the first or primary windings creates a
varying magnetic flux in the transformer's core, and thus a varying magnetic field through
the secondary windings. If a load is connected to the secondary, an electric current will flow
in the secondary windings and electrical energy will be transferred from the primary circuit
through the transformer to the load. The ratio of the transformer is the number of turns in the
secondary windings to the number of turns in the primary windings.
[0013]      The solution to the power distribution problem often employed is to boost the
incoming voltage to allow sensitive appliances to continue operating. One solution has been
to use motor driven Variac type transformers that continuously adjust the voltage to the
nominal voltage. However, this solution requires mechanical implementation that is prone to
                                                   4

failure. A second solution has been to employ electronic solid-state boosters that
continuously adjust the voltage to the nominal voltage. However, this solution is expensive
and inefficient. A third solution is to use relay switched transformers. The problem with this
solution is that the mechanical contacts are prone to failure with the high currents being
switched. Finally, manually switched transformers have been tried. This solution is
undesirable because it requires a person in attendance, and the transformer can be
inadvertently left in the boost position. Each of the above solutions of the past has problems
of safety, efficiency, cost, complexity and/or reliability. The solutions of the past that utilize
transformers and switching perform the switching on the transformer secondary windings
side, where disadvantageous high currents are present. There is also a disadvantageous
interruption of current with such prior solutions during the switching period.

conveyance to an induction motor with a digital signal processor that calculates and

through a control element. Pub. No. U.S. 2010/0117588 proposes a motor controller for
maximizing the energy savings in an AC induction motor at every load wherein the motor is
calibrated at two or more load points to establish a control line, which is then programmed
into a non-volatile memory of the motor controller. Pub. No. U.S. 2010/0320956 proposes a
closed loop motor controller to reduce the supply voltage to a pump jack electric motor when
the motor would be generating energy in open loop mode.

[0017]     A need exists for a system and method to manage energy usage that reduces brown
outs, blackouts, and costs.
                                                   6

                           BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
[0018]     During a first predetermined time period, such as when blackouts are not
anticipated, a digital signal processor (DSP) controls an IGBT/FET-based device to supply a
predetermined voltage that is less than the AC incoming line voltage or mains input voltage.
Phase input connections are provided for inputting analog signals into the device and system.
A magnetic flux concentrator or a current transformer senses the incoming analog signal and
a volts zero crossing point detector determines the zero volts crossing point of the signal.
The positive half cycle and negative half cycle of the signal is identified and routed to the
DSP for processing the signal. The signal is reduced by a driver control via pulse width
modulation and the reduced amount of energy is outputted, thereby yielding an energy
savings for an end user.
[0019]     A microprocessor measures the AC incoming line voltage, and compares it with
the predetermined voltage. When the AC incoming line voltage is higher than the
predetermined voltage, the microprocessor controls a switch on the primary windings side of
a transformer to short circuit the primary windings. When the measured voltage is less than
the predetermined voltage, and voltage increase is needed, such as during a brownout
condition, the microprocessor controls the switch to connect one end of the primary windings
                                                 7

to neutral, removing the short circuit from the transformer and allowing the secondary
voltage to add to the AC incoming line voltage to provide a boosted output voltage to the
predetermined voltage through the hot output line of the secondary windings side of the
transformer. The secondary windings are not switched.
[0020]      During a second predetermined time period, such as when blackout conditions are
anticipated, the DSP controls the IGBT/FET-based device to supply an allocated amount of
power. The DSP and/or the microprocessor monitors power consumption, which may be
displayed. When the power consumption exceeds the allocated amount of power, the DSP
may shut off the power.
[0021]      Alternatively, when the consumed power exceeds the allocated power, a signal
may be sent alerting the need to reduce power usage. The signal may be audible, visible, or
other means. The power consumer may reduce the load to meet the allocated power
requirement. In one embodiment, wirelessly controlled electrical outlets may be used to
selectively reduce the load in response to the signal. If the load has not been adequately
reduced after a predetermined amount of time, the DSP may shut off power. The consumer
may then reduce some load, and initiate a command to turn on the power. The command
may be initiated by changing the condition of a switch, including manually and/or wirelessly.
                                                  8

If the load has still not been adequately reduced after the power has been restored, then the
DSP may again shut off the power. Alternatively, the DSP may provide another signal that
may again alert that the load must be reduced. If the consumed power is not sufficiently
reduced after a predetermined amount of time, then the DSP may shut off power for the
duration of the second predetermined time period.
[0022]     Further alternatively, when the consumed power exceeds the allocated power, the
DSP may shut off power to predetermined electrical outlets, while providing power to other
electrical outlets, to reduce the overall power usage to the allocated power amount.
Predetermined consumer preferences may be implemented. The system may use wirelessly
controlled electrical outlets that may be automatically shut-down to meet the predetermined
power amount. The system may be monitored, operated and adjusted wirelessly.

[0153]      With reference to FIG. 1, a block diagram of an energy savings device and system
1 for use in a three-phase electrical system is shown. The energy savings device and system
1 includes various components and means for reducing the amount of energy inputted
wherein the reduced energy yields a virtually non-existent or minimal effect on the
performance of an electronically-operated device.
[0154]      A predetermined amount of incoming energy 19 having at least one analog signal
20 therein is inputted into the device and system 1 via an inputting means, which is
preferably at least one phase input connection 2. A neutral 18 line is also provided in the
device and system 1. As shown in FIG. 1, the system and device 1 is utilized in a three-phase
electrical system having an A-B-C phase plus neutral for use as a reference point and as a
sink for a clamped back-EMF that is produced when the current in a lagging power factor
load is interrupted. However, the energy savings system 1 may be utilized in a single phase
                                                  19

system and/or a bi-phase system as well, wherein the only difference in structure is the
amount of phase input connections 2 (e.g., in a single phase system, only one phase input
connection 2 is utilized in addition to a neutral connection (A) and in a bi-phase system, two
phase input connections 2 are utilized (A & B) in addition to a neutral connection).
[0155]      At least one phase input connection 2 is connected to at least one sensing means,
which is at least one magnetic flux concentrator 3 that senses the predetermined amount of
incoming energy 19. It is also contemplated that at least one current transformer may be used
instead of the at least one magnetic flux concentrator 3 for all embodiments. The magnetic
flux concentrator 3 galvanically isolates the current of the incoming energy 19 and reports
any over-current conditions to a routing means, which is preferably at least one logic device
9. If there are any over-current conditions, then the over-current conditions are
simultaneously reported to the logic device 9 and a processing means, which is preferably a
digital signal processor 10, wherein the digital signal processor 10 immediately shuts down
the device and system 1. This electronic breaker action is intended to safeguard the device
and system 1 itself, as well as the terminal equipment used in conjunction with the device and
system 1 in the event of a short circuit or overload. Thus, the logic device 9 provides total
protection of the power control devices in the event of a software/firmware glitch and/or
                                                  20

power line glitch or surge in real-time as the reaction time of the logic device 9 and digital
signal processor 10 is preferably 5[ts. The logic device 9 arbitrates between the drive signals
applied to the IGBT/FET half cycle control transistors 54 and 58 and the signals applied to
the IGBT/FET shunt control transistors 59, 60, 67 and 68. Therefore, it avoids the
IGBT/FET half cycle control transistors 54 and 58 and IGBT/FET shunt control transistors
59, 60, 67 and 68 from being simultaneously driven to an on-condition that could lead to the
failure of the power control and/or shunt elements. The digital signal processor 10 preferably
includes at least one A/D converter 11.
[0156]      Prior to reporting the analog value of the phase current from the phase input
connection 2 to the digital signal processor 10, the magnetic flux concentrator 3 or current
transformer first transmits the incoming energy 19 through at least one signal conditioning
means, which is preferably at least one analog signal conditioning device 4. After the
signal(s) have been conditioned, a method which is described below, the conditioned signals
are then sent to a volts zero crossing point determining means, which is preferably at least
one volts zero crossing point detector 5, for detecting the point where the AC voltage goes
through zero volts relative to neutral 18, which is commonly referred to as a zero crossing
point.
                                                  21

[0157]      After the zero crossing point is detected and if using a three-phase electrical
system, the conditioned signal then enters at least one loss detecting means, which is
preferably at least one lost phase detection device 6 and at least one phase rotation
determination and rotating means, which is preferably at least one phase rotation device 7, so
as to prepare the signal for proper inputting into at least one half cycle identifying means,
which is preferably at least one half cycle identifier 8, and then the logic device 9 and digital
signal processor 10. Details of the half cycle identifier 8 are discussed below.
[0158]      The power control is executed via at least one voltage reducing means, which
preferably includes at least one IGBT/FET drive control 15, in electrical connection with the
digital signal processor 10 to reduce the energy a predetermined amount. Prior to the
processed signals entering the reducing means, however, the signals may once again be
conditioned through at least one analog signal conditioning device 4 so as to clean a signal to
remove any spurious signals or transient signals. The command signals to exercise control of
the IGBT/FET drive control 15 of the voltage reducing means are determined by the digital
signal processor 10 and mitigated by the logic device 9.
[0159]      The reduced energy 24 then enters at least one magnetic flux concentrator 3 or
current transformer and then enters at least one outputting means, which is preferably at least
                                                   22

one phase output connection 17, and is outputted to an electrically-operated device for
consumption.
[0160]     The system and device 1 is powered via a powering means, which is preferably a
power supply unit 12 in electrical connection with the digital signal processor 10. A resetting
means, which is preferably a reset switch 13, is preferably provided to permit a user to reset
the device and system 1 as desired. In addition, an indicator means, such as a light emitting
diode 14, may be in electrical connection with reset switch 13 so as to alert a user if the
device and system 1 needs to be reset.
[0161]     The device and system 1 may optionally include at least one digital electricity
meter 50 and at least one communication means, such as a USB communications interface
25, capable of interfacing with at least one computing device 16 having at least one USB port
74 and at least one window interface 40, via wired or wireless transmission. The USB
communications interface 25 permits a user to monitor, display and/or configure the device
and system 1 via his/her computing device 16. However, inclusion of the USB
communications interface 25 is not necessary in the implementation of the device and system
1. In addition, a real time clock 49 may optionally be incorporated within the digital signal
processor 10 of or otherwise connected to the energy savings device and system 1.
                                                23

[0162]     A user may determine the operational manner in which to use the energy savings
device and system 1, e.g., a user may select how he/she would like to save energy by either
inputting the desired RMS value, inputting the desired percentage voltage or inputting the
desired percentage savings reduction into a computing device 16. For example, if a user
chooses to reduce the incoming voltage by a fixed percentage, the energy savings device and
system 1 permits such voltage percentage reduction and automatically lowers the voltage so
as to be consistent with a maximum allowed harmonic content by establishing a lower
voltage threshold. The lower voltage threshold assures that in lower or brown-out conditions,
the system and device 1 does not continue to attempt to reduce the available voltage by the
percentage reduction specified.
[0163]     FIG. 2 is perspective plan view of a sensing means. The sensing means, which is
at least one magnetic flux concentrator 3 or at least one current transformer, measures AC
current galvanically when connected to active circuitry of the device and system 1 of the
present invention. A housing 27, which preferably is made of plastic, includes a housing top
half 29 and a housing bottom half 30 and a hinge 30 connecting the two halves 29 and 30,
carries a circuit board 26 having a magnetic flux concentrator chip 37 mounted on the bottom
side of the housing top half 29. Each half 29 and 30 includes at least one notched portion
                                                 24

wherein when the halves 29 and 30 are joined together, at least one aperture 38 is formed for
permitting a conductor 28 to extend therethrough. The utilization of said housing 27
accurately defines the distance between the magnetic flux concentrator chip 37 and the core
center of the conductor 28. A window detector associated with the magnetic flux
concentrator chip 37 accurately determines when current, within the negative or positive half
cycles, is out of a normal ranges. In addition, the magnetic flux concentrator 3 uses an open
collector Schmidt buffer to allow multiple concentrators 3 to be connected to both the analog
signal conditioning device 4 and the logic device 9.
[0164]      The housing 27 snaps together and bears on the conductor 28, which is preferably a
cable, to ensure that the conductor 28 is held firmly against the housing 27. The housing top
half 29 may be formed in various sizes so as to accommodate differing wire gauges. A
plurality of apertures 38 of various sizes may be formed when the halves 29 and 30 are
snapped together so as to accommodate conductors 28 of various widths. The magnetic flux
concentrator 3 provides galvanic isolation of the incoming energy 19, performs accurate
current measurement, is adaptable to any range of currents through multiple cable passages
located within the housing 27, provides high voltage galvanic isolation, has zero harmonic
                                                  25

distortion and superb linearity. In addition, since the current measurement range is
determined by mechanical means, no changes are necessary to the printed circuit board 26.
The following equation determines the approximate sensitivity:
           Vout = 0.06*I/(D+0.3mm)
[0165]     where I = current in the conductor 28 and D   =  the distance in mm from the top
surface of the magnetic flux concentrator chip 37 to the center of the conductor 28.
[0166]      Since no electrical connection is made to the measurement target, full galvanic
isolation is achieved. Moreover, there is zero insertion loss and, therefore, no heat is
dissipated nor energy lost as there is no electrical connection made nor is a shunt or a
transformer used.
[0167]     FIG. 3 is a circuit diagram of the sensing means. The magnetic flux concentrator 3
measures the magnetic flux generated when an alternating electric current flows within the
conductor 28. Over-current is accomplished by comparators 34 that form a window
comparator. When the thresholds set by resistors 63 are exceeded by an output of the
magnetic flux concentrator 3, which may yield a "CurrentHi" signal, open collector outputs
of comparators 34 go low and pass to the logic device 9 and a microprocessor non-maskable
input to shut-down the device and system 1. To avoid ground loop problems, the magnetic
                                                  26

flux concentrator 3 preferably includes an integrated circuit 62 that regulates the operational
voltage of the magnetic flux concentrator 3 to 5VDC.
[0168]     With reference to FIG. 4, a circuit diagram of a signal conditioning means is
shown. The signal conditioning means, which is preferably at least one analog signal
conditioning device 4, cleans or conditions a 50/60Hz sine wave analog signal so as to
remove any spurious signals or transient signals prior to its transmittal to the half cycle
identifier 8. If the sine wave has any noise or distortion of sufficient amplitude, this can,
under certain circumstances, give rise to false zero cross detections. Thus, the inclusion of
such analog signal conditioning device 4 is of importance.
[0169]      To properly condition the sine wave signal, operational amplifiers 70 are utilized.
An operational amplifier 70 is configured as an active, second order, low pass filter to
remove or reduce harmonics and any transients or interfering signals that may be present.
When utilizing such filter, however, group delay occurs wherein the group delay offsets, in
time, the zero crossing of the filtered signal from the actual zero crossing point of the
incoming AC sine wave. To remedy the delay, operational amplifiers 70 are provided to
allow the phase change necessary to correct the zero crossing point accurately in time as
required. The output of the operational amplifiers 70 is the fully conditioned 50/60 Hz sine
                                                  27

wave signal that is connected to the A/D converter 11 of the digital signal processor 10 (see
FIG. 1) for root-mean-square (RMS) value measurement. This signal is exactly half the
supply rail which is necessary to enable measurement of both positive and negative half
cycles. The A/D converter 11 performs the well-known 2s compliment math to enable same
and requires the AC signal to deviate both positively and negatively with respect to the center
or split rail voltage. The signal also enters the half cycle identifier 8.
[0170]      FIGS. 5 and 6 show an oscillogram and circuitry diagram, respectively, for a volts
zero crossing point determining means. The volts zero crossing point determining means,
which is preferably at least one volts zero crossing point detector 5 wherein the zero crossing
point 21 is accurately determined. An operational amplifier 70 is configured as a comparator
34 with its reference at exactly half the supply voltage using half the supply rail. A
comparator 34 operates at a very high gain and, as a result, switches within a few millivolts
of the split rail voltage.
[0171]      Additional conditioning of the zero cross signal is further performed by a Schmidt
buffer 35. Subsequent to the additional signal processing, a very accurate square wave 69
accurate to a few millivolts of the actual volts zero crossing point 21 of the sine wave is
produced.
                                                  28

[0172]      FIG. 7 shows a circuit diagram of a loss detecting means and phase rotation
determination and rotating means. The loss detecting means, which is preferably at least one
lost phase detection device 6, and the phase rotation determination and rotating means, which
is preferably at least one phase rotation device 7, work together so as to properly prepare the
signal for transmittal into the logic device 9 and digital signal processor 10 when utilizing a
three-phase electrical system. The lost phase detection device 6 circuitry includes operational
amplifiers 70 configured as comparators 34 where each utilizes a high value of series
resistors, comprising two 0.5 Meg Ohm resistors in series, which is necessary for achieving
the required working voltage of the resistors 63, and two diodes 53 connected in inverse
parallel. The diodes 53 are centered around the volts zero crossing point 21 of the incoming
sine wave 39 at approximately the voltage forward drop of the diodes 53, which is in turn
applied to the comparator 34 that further conditions the signal suitable for passing to the logic
device 9 and digital signal processor 10, resulting in the system being shut down in the
absence of any of the signals.
[0173]      In a three-phase electrical system, the phase rotation may be either A-B-C or A-C
B. To enable the digital signal processor 10 to properly function, the phase rotation must first
be ascertained. The comparators 34 are used to detect the volts zero crossing point(s) 21 and
                                                   29

report the point(s) 21 to the digital signal processor 10. The digital signal processor 10, in
turn, makes the rotational timing through timing logic. Each of the operational amplifiers 70
act as a simple comparator 34 with the input signal, in each case provided by the inverse
parallel pairs of diodes 53 in conjunction with the series resistors 63.
[0174]     FIGS. 8, 9 and 10 show a circuit diagram and oscillograms, respectively, of a half
cycle identifying means. The half cycle identifying means, which is preferably at least one
half cycle identifier 8, provides additional data to the logic device 9 and digital signal
processor 10 by identifying whether the half cycle of the analog signal is positive or negative.
This is of great importance to avoid a situation where if the IGBT/FET half cycle control
transistors 54 and 58 and the IGBT/FET shunt control transistors 59, 60, 67 and 68 are
simultaneously on, a short circuit would occur across the input power.
[0175]      The operational amplifiers 70, which are configured as window comparators 34,
have separate switching thresholds determined by at least one resistor 63. As shown in
FIG. 9, there are three signals, an absolute zero cross signal 36 and two co-incident signals
wherein one co-incident signal has a positive half cycle 22 and one co-incident signal has a
negative half cycle 23 of an incoming sine wave 39. The design allows the window to be
adjusted to provide, when required, the "dead band."
                                                  30

[0176]     With reference to FIGS. 11 A, 11B, 1 IC, 1ID and 11 E, circuit diagrams of the
routing means are shown. The routing means, which is preferably at least one logic device 9,
works in real time, outside the digital signal processor 10, to arbitrate between the on-times
of the IGBT/FET half cycle control transistors 54 and 58 and the IGBT/FET shunt control
transistors 59, 60, 67 and 68.
[0177]      The logic device 9 performs the routing function to assure that all signals are
appropriate to the instantaneous requirement and polarity of the incoming sine wave 39 and
performs the pulse width modulation function so as to assure the safe operation of the energy
savings device and system 1, regardless of the state of the digital signal processor 10,
presence of noise, interference or transients. The circuitry of the isolator 71, as shown in
FIG. 1 IC, permits programming of the logic device 9. The circuitry of the resistor support 79
of the logic device 9, as shown in FIG. I1D, is necessary to operate the logic device 9. As
shown in FIG. I1E, the circuitry of the logic device connector 80 enables activation and
deactivation of certain aspects of the logic device 9.
[0178]     Dealing with a resistive load is much less demanding than dealing with a reactive
load, in particular, an inductively reactive load. Currently, pulse width modulation (PWM) is
defined as modulation of a pulse carrier wherein the value of each instantaneous sample of a
                                                   31

modulating wave produces a pulse of proportional duration by varying the leading, trailing,
or both edges of a pulse and which is also known as pulse-duration modulation. However,
for purposes of this invention and application, PWM is defined as the modulation of a pulse
carrier wherein at least one slice is removed from an area under the curve of a modulating
wave. When PWM is applied directly to the incoming power, the inductive component reacts
when power is removed and attempts to keep the current going and will raise its self
generated voltage until the current finds a discharge path. This circumstance, without the
shunt circuitry, would destroy the half cycle control transistors.
[0179]      Therefore, the logic device 9 is a "supervisor" wherein it takes the appropriate
action should the digital signal processor 10 "hang-up", if there is an over-current condition
or if there is a phase loss. In any of these situations, the logic device 9 responds immediately,
in real time, to safeguard the half cycle control transistors and shunt devices and the
equipment connected to it.
[0180]      Additionally, the logic device 9 mitigates the complex drive requirements of the
IGBT/FET half cycle control transistors 54 and 58 and the IGBT/FET shunt control
transistors 59, 60, 67 and 68 and, to an extent, unloads the digital signal processor 10 of this
task. Since the logic device 9 controls this function, it may be performed in real time and,
                                                    32

therefore, the timing control of the drive requirements can be held to much stricter limits than
would be achieved by the digital signal processor 10. The ability to respond in real time is
important to the safe, reliable operation of the energy savings device and system 1 of the
present invention.
[0181]     FIGS. 12A, 12B, 12C, 12D, 12E, 12F and 12G show oscillograms and circuit
diagrams of a voltage reducing means. The voltage reducing means, which preferably
includes at least one IGBT/FET drive control 15, reduces the analog signals of the incoming
sine wave 39, which is the amount of energy inputted into the energy savings device and
system 1, by pulse width modulation wherein at least one slice is removed from an area under
the curve of the modulating sine wave 39, thereby reducing energy and without the attendant
harmonics previously associated with such voltage control. This technique, as shown in FIG.
12A, works in conjunction with the inherent characteristics of the IGBT/FET devices that
allows the on and off triggering point to be controlled. All of the potential energy is contained
in each half cycle and, in the case of a complete half cycle, has the greatest area under the
curve. If each half cycle is modulated on a mark space ratio of 90%, the area under the curve
is reduced by 10% and, as a result, the energy is reduced proportionally as seen in FIG. 12A.
                                                  33

[0182]     The original shape of the input sine wave is retained and, since modulation can be
made high, possibly 10's of KHz, filtering of the output is possible due to the smaller size of
the wound components becoming a practical proposition. The overall effect is realized when
the root-mean-square value (RMS), which is the square root of the time average of the square
of a quantity or, for a periodic quantity, the average is taken over one complete cycle and
which is also referred to as the effective value, is correctly measured and the output voltage is
seen to be reduced by a percentage similar to the mark space ratio employed. Reduced
voltage results in reduced current, thereby resulting in reduced power consumed by an end
user.
[0183]     Since IGBT and FET devices are unipolar in nature, in the case of AC control, it is
necessary to provide at least one IGBT/FET drive control 15 to control each half cycle.
Furthermore, to avoid reverse biasing, steering diodes are used to route each half cycle to the
appropriate device. Additionally, many IGBT and FET devices have a parasitic diode
shunting main element wherein connecting two IGBT or FET devices in inverse parallel
would result in having two of the parasitic diodes in inverse parallel, thereby rendering the
arrangement inoperative as a controlling element.
                                                   34

[0184]      The diodes 53 are connected across the positive half cycle transistor 54 and the
negative half cycle control transistor 58 and works ideally for a purely resistive load or a
current-leading reactive load. However, when driving a load with a current lagging power
factor, when the current in an inductively reactive component is suddenly removed, as is the
case when the modulation occurs, the collapsing magnetic field attempts to keep the current
going, similar to an electronic fly-wheel, and produces an EMF that will rise in voltage until
it finds a discharge path that will enable release of the energy. With this arrangement, this
"back EMF" would cause active components of the half cycle control element to fail. To
prevent this from occurring, additional IGBT/FET shunt control transistors 59, 60, 67 and 68
are placed in a shunt configuration.
[0185]      During the positive half cycle, the positive half cycle control transistor 54
modulates and a diode 53 is active during the complete positive half cycle. The IGBT second
shunt control transistor 60 is turned fully on and a diode 53 is active. Therefore, any opposite
polarity voltages resulting from the back EMF of the load are automatically clamped.
[0186]      During the negative half cycle, the other devices comprised in series and shunt
networks are activated in a similar manner.
                                                  35

[0187]     During the switching transitions, a spike may be present which may last for a very
short period of time. The spike is clamped by the transorb devices 52, which are capable of
absorbing large amounts of energy for a very short period of time and enables vary fast
response time. The transorb devices 52 also clamp any mains bourn transient signals due to
lightning strikes or other sources that could otherwise damage the active components of the
half cycle transistors or shunt transistors. Further, while each half cycle transistor is pulse
width modulating, the other half cycle transistor is turned fully on for the precise duration of
the half cycle. The duties of these half cycle transistors reverse during the next half cycle.
This process provides complete protection against the back EMF signals discussed above.
This arrangement is necessary, especially near the zero crossing time when both shunt
elements are in transition.
[0188]     Each of the IGBT/FET half cycle control transistors 54 and 58 and the IGBT/FET
shunt control transistors 59, 60, 67 and 68 have insulated gate characteristics that require the
devices to be enhanced to enable them to turn on. This enhancement voltage is preferably 12
Volts in magnitude and is preferably supplied by a floating power supply, preferably one for
each pair. This is only possible since the IGBT/FET devices are operated in the common
emitter mode in the case of the IGBT's and in the common source mode in the case of the
                                                   36

FET's; otherwise, four isolated power supplies would be required for each phase. Each of the
pairs requires a separate drive signal that is provided by the isolated, optically-coupled
drivers 66. These drivers 66 make use of the isolated supplies and serve to very rapidly turn
on and turn-off each power device. These drivers 66 are active in both directions, which is
necessary since the input capacitance of the power devices are high and have to be actively
discharged rapidly at the turn-off point and charged rapidly at the turn-on point.
[0189]     The problem with direct pulse width modulation is when driving an inductively
reactive load as when the IGBT modulates off, there is a back EMF that needs to be clamped.
Referring to FIG. 12B, an incoming sine wave 39 that is applied to the positive half cycle
control transistor 54 and the negative half cycle control transistor 58 is shown. Normally,
these half cycle control transistors 54 and 58 are in the "off' condition and need to be driven
on. During the positive half cycle, the positive half cycle control transistor 54 is modulated
and works in conjunction with a diode 53 to pass the modulated positive half cycle to a line
output terminal. The IGBT second shunt control transistor 60 is on for the duration of the half
cycle and operates in conjunction with a diode 53 so as to clamp the back EMF to ground.
During the positive half cycle, the negative half cycle control transistor 58 is turned on fully
                                                  37

and its on condition is supported by a diode 53. These diodes 53 perform the appropriate
steering of the signals.
[0190]     Due to modulation of the positive half cycle, a back EMF signal occurs. Since the
negative half cycle control transistor 58 is on during this time, the negative back EMF is
passed through a diode 53 to be clamped at the simultaneous AC positive half cycle voltage.
[0191]     Although no modulation is applied to the IGBT first shunt control transistor 59 and
the IGBT second shunt control transistor 60, these transistors 59 and 60 work in conjunction
with diodes 53 in a similar manner as set forth above.
[0192]     As shown in FIG. 12B, which is an oscillogram of the voltage reducing means of
the IGBT-based device, during the positive half cycle 22, a drive signal is applied to the
negative half cycle control transistor 85 and a drive signal is applied to the IGBT second
shunt control transistor 87. During the negative half cycle 23, a drive signal is applied to the
positive half cycle control transistor 84 and a drive signal is applied to the IGBT first shunt
control transistor 86. The positive half cycle drive signal 82 applied to the positive half cycle
control transistor 54 and the negative half cycle drive signal 83 applied to the negative half
cycle control transistor 58 are also shown.
                                                  38

[0193]     Similarly, as shown in FIG. 12E, which is an oscillogram of the voltage reducing
means of the FET-based device, during the positive half cycle 22, a drive signal is applied to
the negative half cycle control transistor 85 and a drive signal is applied to the FET second
shunt control transistor 89. During the negative half cycle 23, a drive signal is applied to the
positive half cycle control transistor 84 and a drive signal is applied to the FET first shunt
control transistor 88. The positive half cycle drive signal 82 applied to the positive half cycle
control transistor 54 and the negative half cycle drive signal 83 applied to the negative half
cycle control transistor 58 are also shown.
[0194]     In summary, there are two clamping strategem used, the first for the positive half
cycle and the second for the negative half cycle. During the positive half cycle, when the
positive half cycle control transistor 54 is modulated, the negative half cycle control transistor
58 and the second shunt control transistor 60 are on. During the negative half cycle, when the
negative half cycle control transistor 58 is modulated, the positive half cycle control transistor
54 and the IGBT first shunt control transistor 59 are on.
[0195]     The hardware utilized in the IGBT-based and FET-based energy savings device
and method 1 of the present invention is identical with the only difference being the
IGBT/FET half cycle control transistors 54 and 58 and the IGBT/FET shunt control
                                                  39

transistors 59, 60, 67 and 68. The circuitry diagrams of the IGBT-based circuitry FIG. 12C
and the IGBT based driver FIG. 12D and the FET-based circuitry FIG. 12E and the FET
based driver FIG. 12F are shown for comparison purposes.
[0196]     With reference to FIG. 13, a circuit diagram of a combined resetting means and
indicator means is shown. The resetting means, which is preferably at least one reset switch
13, and indicator means, which is preferably at least one light emitting diode 14, work
together so as to indicate when the IGBT/FET-based energy savings device and system 1 is
not properly working and to permit a user to reset the device and system 1 as needed.
Preferably, the light emitting diode 14 will indicate that the device and system 1 is working
properly by flashing on/off. When in a fault condition, the light emitting diode 14 preferably
changes to an uneven pattern that is immediately obvious and recognizable as a fault
condition.
[0197]     FIGS. 14A and 14B are a circuit diagram of a power supply unit 12 of a powering
means. The powering means, which is preferably at least one power supply unit 12, accepts a
variety of inputs, including, but not limited to, single phase 80 V"ns to 265 V,  bi-phase 80
Vans to 600 Vans, three-phase 80 Vans to 600 Vans and 48 Hz to 62 Hz operation.
                                                  40

[0198]      The power supply unit 12 is fully-isolated and double-regulated in design. At the
input, a rectifier 72 composed of diodes 53 accepts single, bi- and three-phase power. The
power is applied to a switching regulator 90 and integrated circuit 62 via a transformer 57. In
view of the large voltages existing across the DC terminals, the switching regulator 90 and
integrated circuit 62 is supplemented by a FET transistor 73 employed in a StackFET
configuration in order to raise its working voltage. The secondary of transformer 57 has a
diode 53 and a reservoir capacitor 56. The DC voltage across capacitor 56 is passed via the
network resistors 63 and a Zener diode 75 to an optical isolator 65 and finally to the feedback
terminals. Use of the optical isolator 65 guarantees galvanic isolation between the input and
the supply output (6.4V DC). Finally, the output of the linear voltage regulators 81 (3.3 VA
DC) is passed to a operational amplifier 70, which is configured as a unity gain buffer with
two resistors 63 that set the split rail voltage. The main neutral is connected to this split rail
point and also a zero Ohm resistor. An inductor 78 isolates the supply rail digital (+3.3V)
from the analog (3.3 VA) and reduce noise.
[0199]     Next, FIGS. 15A, 15B, 15C, 15D and 15E show the circuitry of a communication
means. The communication means, which is preferably at least one USB communications
                                                    41

interface 25, permits a user to monitor and set the parameters of the energy savings device
and system 1 of the present invention as desired.
[0200]      The circuitry of a USB communications interface 25 is shown in FIG. 15B, an
isolator block 71 utilized in isolating the USB communications interface 25 from the digital
signal processor 10 is shown in FIG. 15C and first and second connectors 76 and 77 for
connecting the communications means to the digital signal processor 10 are shown in FIGS.
15D and 15E.
[0201]      Since the main printed circuit board is not isolated from neutral, it is necessary to
galvanically isolate the USB communications interface 25. Use is made of the built-in serial
communications feature of the digital signal processor 10 to serially communicate with the
communication means 46. Signals, on the user side of the isolation barrier, are applied to an
integrated circuit 62, which is a device that takes serial data and translates it to USB data for
direct connection to a computing device 16 via a host USB port 74. The host USB 5V power
is used to power the communication means 46 and voids the necessity of providing isolated
power from the unit. Preferably, there are two activity light emitting diodes 14, that indicate
activity on the TX (transmit) and RX (receive) channels. Communications preferably
operates at 9600 Baud, which is adequate in view of the small amount of data passed.
                                                  42

[0202]     Although the inclusion of a communications means is not necessary in the
performance of the energy savings device and system 1, it is a feature that permits easier use
of the device and system 1.
[0203]     Finally, with reference to FIGS. 16 and 17, screen shots of a windows interface 40
of the present invention are shown. The windows interface 40 is displayed on the computing
device 16 and permits a user to monitor and configure the energy savings device and system
1 as desired. A main monitoring screen 41 having a plurality of fields 42 in which an end user
may adjust the energy savings device and system 1 are provided. For example, the fields 42
may include an operational mode field 43, a phase field 44, a startup field 45, a calibration
field 46 and a setpoints field 47.
[0204]     In the operational field 43, a user may select the manner in which he/she/it desires
to conserve energy. The manners include voltage reduction percentage wherein the output
Volts is adjusted by a fixed percentage, savings reduction percentage wherein the output
Volts is aimed at achieving a savings percentage and voltage regulation wherein the root
mean squared Volts output is a pre-set value.
[0205]     The phase field 44 permits a user to select the phase type used in connection with
the energy savings device and system 1, i.e., single phase, bi-phase or three phase.
                                                 43

[0206]     The startup field 45 permits a user to configure the system and device 1 to
randomly start and/or to have a delayed or "soft start" wherein the user input the delay time
in seconds in which the system and device will start.
[0207]     The calibration field 46 permits a user to input the precise calibrations desired
and/or to rotate the phases.
[0208]     The setpoints field 47 displays the settings selected by the user and shows the
amount of energy saved by utilizing the energy savings device and system 1 as voltage
regulation, voltage reduction percentage or power savings reduction percentage. With respect
to percentage voltage reduction, the lower limit RMS is set below the incoming voltage
passed therethrough to permit the incoming voltage to be passed through when it is less than
or equal to the lower limit voltage. With respect to the percentage savings reduction, the
lower limit RMS is set below the incoming voltage passed therethrough.
[0209]     Indicators 48 are provided on the windows interface 40 display operating current,
operating voltage, line frequency, calculated power savings and phase rotation.
[0210]     A real time clock 49 may be incorporated into the windows interface 40 to allow
programming of additional voltage reduction for a predetermined time and a predetermined
operational time, e.g., for seasons, days of the week, hours of the day, for a predetermined
                                                  44

operational time. In addition, a user may program the energy savings device and system 1 to
operate during various times of the day. The real time clock 49 is set through a
communications port or fixed to allow the selection of defined seasonal dates and time when,
through experience, are known to exhibit power grid overload. During these times, the system
allows further reduction of the regulated AC voltage, thereby reducing the load on the grid.
Multiple time can be defined each with its own additional percentage reduction or voltage
drop.
[0211]     The digital electricity meter 50 provides a means to log statistical data on power
usage, power factor and surges. The digital electricity meter 50 also provides the ability to
include capacitors for power factor correction, operates on single, bi and three-phase systems
and operates on all world wide voltages. It may be used remotely or locally to disable or
enable the user's power supply at will by the provider. In addition, the digital electricity
meter 50 may detect when the energy savings device and system 1 has been bridged by an
end user attempting to avoid paying for energy consumption wherein the provider is alerted
to such abuse. Finally, use of the real time clock 49 permits a user and/or provider to reduce
the consumption of power at selected times of a day or for a selected time period, thereby
relieving and/or eliminating brown-out conditions.
                                                 45

[0212]     FIGS. 18A-1 8C taken together show a first embodiment of a voltage booster
apparatus 30' configured for 220/230 Voltage root mean square (Vrms). The voltage booster
apparatus 30' may also be configured for 120/127 Vrms. FIG. 18A shows transformer 41'
and switch 16'. Switch 16' comprises first relay 20' and second relay 22'. FIG. 18B shows
power supply 24'. FIG. 18C shows microprocessor 26'. Turning to FIG. 18A, secondary
windings 2A and 2B of transformer 41' are in series between the input line hot terminal 6'
and the output line hot terminal 8'. Hot input line 34' to hot output line 36' passes through
the transformer secondary windings 2A and 2B at all times, and is not switched. To
configure for 120/127 Vrms, then the secondary windings 2A and 2B would be in parallel.
Alternatively, the transformer may be a single voltage type specifically for 230 V, 120 V, or
any other voltage range.
[0213]      The transformer primary windings 10A and 10B have first end or first line 12'
connected to hot input terminal 6' and second end or second line 14' connected through
connector F2 with electronic switch 16'. Switch 16' allows transformer second line 14' to
either (1) connect with first line 12' of the transformer primary windings 10A, 10B, thereby
short-circuiting the transformer 41', or (2) connect with neutral line 18'. Connectors (Fl, F2,
F3) are Faston type connectors. The connectors (Fl, F2, F3) allow for the removably
                                                   46

plugging in of different current rated transformers allowing for greater or lesser loads. Other
types of connectors are also contemplated.
[0214]     When the transformer primary windings second line 14' is switched to neutral, the
secondary voltage adds to the mains input voltage, thereby providing boosted or increased
output voltage at hot output terminal 8'. An electrical load may be connected at hot output
terminal 8', such as a residential, commercial or industrial load. The winding voltage is
phased to be additive to the incoming AC line voltage, thereby providing boosted voltage
when needed. When the microprocessor 26' switches to increased or boosted voltage, the
boosted voltage may be maintained at the incoming Vrms multiplied by the percentage ratio
of the transformer turns ratio.
[0215]     When switch 16' is switched to the other condition, state, or position, removing the
second line 14' connection from neutral and connecting it with first line 12', the transformer
primary windings 10A and 10B are short circuited. By creating a short circuit in the non
boosted condition or state, the transformer 41' is disconnected and does not consume any
power. Also, since the primary 10A and 10B is shorted out, and the secondary 2A and 2B is
permanently connected between input terminal 6' and output terminal 8', there will be
substantially no reactive component of current in the secondary side and therefore
                                                 47

substantially no inductively reactive losses are incurred during non-boost operation. The
only impediments to the passage of the AC power from hot input 6' to hot output 8' will be
the very small ohmic resistance of the copper or other windings of the secondary windings
2A and 2B.
[0216]      The switching is advantageously performed on the transformer primary side (10A,
10B). While switching could take place on the secondary side (2A, 2B) of the transformer
41', disadvantageous high currents would be present. Since the transformer 41' may have a
ratio of ten (10) to one (1), only one-tenth of the current would need be switched in the
primary side (10A, 10B) of the transformer 41'. Other transformer ratios are also
contemplated. The transformer ratio is the number of turns in the secondary (2A, 2B) to the
number of turns in the primary (10A, 10B). In all embodiments, this technique of switching
on the primary side allows for the use of smaller more reliable switches for lower current,
such as relay devices 20' and 22', as compared to much more expensive devices if the
switching were to take place at the secondary side (2A, 2B) of the transformer 41'. Also, the
switching on the primary side advantageously provides for no interruption of power during
the switching period. Although two relay devices 20' and 22' are shown, it is also
contemplated that there may be more than two of the devices (20', 22').
                                                  48

[0217]     Power supply 24' (FIG. 18B) may provide power to the switching network 16' and
microprocessor 26'. A small inexpensive five (5) volt DC power supply may be employed to
power the switch 16' and/or microprocessor 26', although other power supplies and voltages
are also contemplated, including alternating current. Devices 20' and 22' (FIG. 18A) may
each consist of an optically coupled driver in communication with a small TRIAC device,
thereby forming two solid-state AC relays. Opto-electronically (opto) isolated Triac drivers
using opto isolated TRIACS (OT1, OT2) are contemplated. Other types of relays are
contemplated. It is also contemplated that the voltage may be controlled through the use of
other power control devices, including TRIACs, SCRs, IGBTs, and/or MOSFETs.
[0218]     Microprocessor 26' (FIG. 18C) measures the AC incoming line voltage, such as in
lines 34' or 28', and decides the voltage level at which the increased voltage should be
employed. Other types of processors are also contemplated. Three small jumper blocks or 3
x 2 header 32' may allow the selection of the six (6) voltages as shown below in Table 1 and
on FIG. 19C:

Other predetermined voltage settings are also contemplated. Other numbers of jumper blocks
or headers 32' are also contemplated. The microprocessor 26' operates and controls the relay
devices 20' and 22' according to the selected voltage.
 [0219]    Microprocessor 26' (FIG. 18C) measures the AC incoming line voltage. The
microprocessor 26' utilizes detection of the zero voltage crossing point of the incoming AC
mains voltage. This zero cross detection is used to assure correct timing of the switching of
the solid-state relays 20' and 22'. Zero cross timing eliminates the possibility of both relays
20' and 22' being on at the same time. FIGS. 5 and 6 propose an oscillogram and circuitry
diagram, respectively, of a volts zero crossing point determining means that is contemplated.
Other types of volts zero crossing point determining means are also contemplated. Hysteresis
may be employed to eliminate any erratic switching around the threshold point set by the
jumpers 32'.
 [0220]    In FIGS. 18A-18C, components R1 to R23 are resistors, components C1 to C8 are
capacitors, components D1 to D3 are diodes, component D4 is a Zener diode, components
D5 and D10 are light emitting diodes, component T1 is a transformer, components T2 and
                                                 50

T3 are transorb devices, component Q1 is an NPN transistor, component U1 is a switching
regulator, components TR1 and TR2 are TRIACs, components OT1 and OT2 are opto

[0221]     FIGS. 19-19C taken together show a second embodiment of a voltage booster
apparatus 54'. FIG. 19 shows exemplary 120 Volt transformer 66'. FIG. 2A shows
exemplary 230 Volt transformer 68'. The wiring arrangements are different in FIGS. 19 and
19A. The windings for the 120 Volt transformer 66' (FIG. 19) are in parallel, and the
windings for the 230 Volt transformer 68' (FIG. 19A) are in series. The same transformer
66', 68' may be used for 120 Volt and for 230 Volt by configuring the wiring arrangements as
shown: parallel for 120 Volts and series for 230 Volts. However, different 66', 68'
transformers may be used as well. The transformer may be a single voltage type specifically
for 230 V, 120 V, or any other voltage range. Other transformers with different current
ratings are also contemplated. Only one such transformer 66', 68' would be connected with
the system at a time. FIG. 19B shows two isolated DC power supplies (50', 52'), power
supply 63', and power supply regulation circuitry 64'. FIG. 19C shows microprocessor 56'
and IGBT switch device 58'. Switch 58' comprises first diode bridge circuit U7, first IGBT
circuit 60', second diode bridge circuit U8, and second IGBT circuit 62'.
                                                 51

[0222]     Turning to FIG. 19, secondary windings 72A and 72B of 120 Volt transformer 66'
are in parallel between the input line hot terminal 78' and the output line hot terminal 80'.
Hot input line 74' to hot output line 76' passes through the transformer secondary windings
72A and 72B at all times, and is not switched. The transformer 66' primary windings 70A
and 70B have first end or first line 82' connected to hot input terminal 78' through connector
F5, and second end or second line 84' connected through connector F14 with electronic
switch 58'. Switch 58' allows transformer 66' second line 84' to either (1) connect with first
line 82' of the transformer 66' primary windings 70A, 70B, thereby short-circuiting the
transformer 66', or (2) connect with neutral line 90'. Connectors F4 through F17 are Faston
type connectors. The connectors (F1 to F17) allow for the removably plugging in or
connecting of different rated transformers (66', 68'), such as 120V and 230V. Other types of
connectors are also contemplated.
[0223]     In FIG. 19A, the 230V transformer 68', like the 120V transformer 66', may be
removably plugged or unplugged into the same connectors (F1 to F17). However, the wiring
arrangement for transformer 68' is different. Other arrangements of wiring and connection
are also contemplated. The transformer 68' secondary windings 92A and 92B are in series
between the input line hot terminal 78' and the output line hot terminal 80'. Hot input line
                                                  52

85' passes through connector F8 to terminal 78'. Hot output line 87' passed through
connector F11 to terminal 80'. Hot input line 85' to hot output line 87' passes through the
transformer secondary windings 92A and 92B at all times, and is not switched. The
transformer 68' primary windings 94A and 94B have first end or first line 96' connected to
hot input terminal 78' through connector F5, and second end or second line 98' connected
through connector F14 with electronic switch 58'. Switch 58' allows transformer 68' second
line 98' to either (1) connect with first line 96' of the transformer 68' primary windings 94A,
94B, thereby short-circuiting the transformer 68', or (2) connect with neutral line 90'.
[0224]      As can now be understood, the same transformer may be used for 120 V and 230
V, with the connections shown in FIGS. 19-19A configuring the transformer for 120 V (FIG.
19) or 230 V (FIG. 19A) as desired. When the transformer primary windings second line 84',
98' is switched to neutral, the secondary voltage adds to the mains input voltage, thereby
providing boosted output voltage at hot output terminal 80'. An electric load may be
connected with output terminal 80'. The winding voltage is phased to be additive to the
incoming AC line voltage, thereby providing boosted voltage when needed.
[0225]      When switch 58' is switched to the other state or condition, removing the primary
windings second line 84', 98' connection from neutral and connecting it with respective first
                                                   53

line 82', 96', the transformer primary windings (70A, 70B) or (94A, 94B) are short circuited.
By creating a short circuit in the non-boosted position, the transformer is disconnected and
does not consume any power. Also, since the primary is shorted out, and the secondary is
permanently connected between hot input terminal 78' and hot output terminal 80', there will
be substantially no reactive component of the current on the secondary windings side and
therefore substantially no inductively reactive losses during non-boost operation. The only
impediments to the passage of the AC power from input 78' to output 80' will be the very
small ohmic resistance of the copper or other windings of the secondary windings. As with
the first embodiment, the switching is advantageously performed on the transformer primary
side, which allows for switching with less current. Also, there is substantially no interruption
of power during the switching period.
[0226]      Turning to FIG. 19B, three independent power supplies (50', 52', 63') may provide
power to switching network 58' and/or microprocessor 56'. First power supply 50' provides
power to first IGBT circuit 60', and second power supply 52' provides power to second
IGBT circuit 62'. It is contemplated that the arrangement could be reversed. Third power
supply 63' may provide power for microprocessor 56', LEDs, and Optos. Other
arrangements are also contemplated. First and second power supplies (50', 52') may each
                                                 54

provide twelve (12) volt DC power, and third power supply 63' may provide five (5) volt DC
power, although other power supplies and voltages are also contemplated, including
alternating current. It is contemplated that there may be only one power supply, or more than
three power supplies.
[0227]     In FIG. 19C, first diode bridge circuit U7 is configured with first IGBT circuit 60'
comprising first IGBT device IG1 and first optically isolated IGBT/MOSFET driver U9.
Second diode bridge circuit U8 is configured with second IGBT circuit 62' comprising
second IGBT device IG2 and second optically isolated IGBT/MOSFET driver U10.              Diode
bridge circuits U7, U8 are used to steer the current positive and negative half cycles to arrive
at a condition known as unidirectional half cycles. This enables the use of a single IGBT
device IG1 and IG2 since the IGBT is a unidirectional device. MOSFET devices are also
contemplated.
[0228]      Switch 58' functions like a single pole, double throw (SPDT) switch, sometimes
referred to as a "changeover switch." When the respective IGBT device IG1 or IG2 is in an
OFF condition, state, or position, then no AC current flows through the respective diode
bridge U7, U8. When the respective IGBT device IG1 or IG2 is in an ON condition, state, or
position, then AC current flows through the respective diode bridge U7, U8. Microprocessor
                                                  55

56' measures the AC incoming line voltage, such as in line 100', and decides the voltage level
at which the increased voltage should be employed. Three small jumper blocks or 3 x 2
header 102' may allow the selection of the six (6) voltages as shown in Table 1 above and in
FIG. 19C. Other predetermined voltage settings are also contemplated. Other numbers of
jumper blocks or header 102' are also contemplated. The microprocessor 56' operates and
controls the IGBT switch device 58' to maintain the selected voltage.
 [0229]    The microprocessor 56' may utilize detection of the zero voltage crossing point of
the incoming AC mains voltage. This zero cross detection is used to assure correct timing of
the switching of the IGBT devices IG1 and IG2. Zero cross timing eliminates the possibility
of both devices IG1 and IG2 being on at the same time. FIGS. 5 and 6 propose an
oscillogram and circuitry diagram, respectively, of a volts zero crossing point determining
means that is contemplated. Other types of volts zero crossing point determining means are
also contemplated. Hysteresis may be employed to eliminate any erratic switching around
the threshold point set by the jumpers 102'.
 [0230]    In FIGS. 19-19C, components R30 to R47 are resistors, components C20 to C29
are capacitors, components D10 and D11 are diodes, component Z1 is a transorb,
components Z2 to Z4 may be (Schottky type) diodes, component Z5 is a Zener diode,
                                                56

components IGI and IG2 are IGBT transistors, component TRA1 is a transformer,
component U2 is a switching regulator, component U3 is an Opto isolator, components U4 to
U6 are linear regulators, components U7 and U8 are diode bridge circuits or bridge rectifiers,
component U9 and U10 are optically isolated IGBT/MOSFET drivers, and component J2 is a
1 x 5 header.
[0231]      As can now be understood, all switching may be performed at substantially less
current on the primary side, such as primary side (10A, 10B) of the transformer 41', than on
the secondary side, such as secondary side (2A, 2B) of transformer 41'. Since the secondary
windings are permanently connected, and the boost switching is performed on the primary
side, there will be substantially no interruption of electricity during the switching period.
This cannot be achieved when switching is performed on the secondary side. Different
embodiments of electronic switches (16', 58') are employed to short circuit the transformer
primary when it is not in use, thereby eliminating the reactive component of the current from
the secondary winding side. The transformer is only active during the voltage boost period.
The amount of boost or increase may be selected by the transformer ratio. Transformers with
different ratios and/or current ratings may be removably connected with the system. The
apparatus may be used for universal operation for AC 120 Volts to 250 Volts. The apparatus
                                                  57

size may be relatively small. There may be very small thermal dissipation. The apparatus
may be cost effective and reliable. The apparatus may be used to supply increased voltage
for electric loads, including residential, industrial or commercial.
[0232]      Although two switching network embodiments are shown in FIGS. 18A-19C, other
embodiments are contemplated, including, but not limited to, the switching performed with
(1) a diode bridge in conjunction with an IGBT, (2) a diode bridge in conjunction with a
power MOSFET, (3) a diode bridge in conjunction with a mechanical switch, relay, contactor
or any other type of mechanical switch, (4) a diode bridge in conjunction with an
SCR/Thyristor or a TRIAC, (5) TRIAC, (6) SCR/Thyristor devices arranged in an inverse
parallel arrangement, or (7) a mechanical switch, relay, contactor or any other type of
mechanical switch. The switches may be used to provide a first state, condition, or position
short circuiting the primary windings, and a second state, condition, or position for adding the
transformer secondary voltage with the mains input voltage. In all embodiments, other
transformer primary windings taps are contemplated to provide different boost levels at a
variety of threshold voltages. The taps may allow a certain number of turns of the
transformer primary winding to be selected, providing a transformer with a variable turns
                                                    58

ratio. For all embodiments, there may be multiple taps on the primary windings selected by
the microprocessor for providing differing boost levels at differing input voltage levels.
[0233]      Managing Electrical Power Usage
[0234]       The IGBT/FET-based device 1 shown in FIGS. 1-17 and the voltage booster
system 30' shown in FIG. 18A-19C may work together to manage electrical power usage.
During a first predetermined time period, such as when blackouts are not anticipated, the DSP
10 controls the IGBT/FET-based device 1 shown in FIG. 1 to supply a predetermined voltage
that is less than the AC incoming line voltage. Phase input connections 2 are provided for
inputting analog signals into the device 1. The magnetic flux concentrator 3 (or a current
transformer) senses the incoming analog signal and the volts zero crossing point detector 5
determines the zero volts crossing point of the signal. The positive half cycle and negative
half cycle of the signal is identified and routed to the digital signal processor 10 for
processing the signal. The signal is reduced by the driver control 15 via pulse width
modulation and the reduced amount of energy is outputted, thereby yielding an energy
savings for an end user. As shown in FIG. 1, real time clock module 49 is connected with the
DSP 10. The real time clock module 49 may be used to set the predetermined time periods.
                                                   59

[0235]     The microprocessor 26' shown in FIG. 18C may measure the AC incoming line
voltage, and compare it with the predetermined voltage. When the AC incoming line voltage
is higher than the predetermined voltage, the microprocessor controls the switching network
16' shown in FIG. 18A on the primary windings side of the transformer to short circuit the
primary windings. When the measured voltage is less than the predetermined voltage, and
voltage increase is needed, such as during a brownout condition, the microprocessor 26'
controls the switching network 16' to connect one end of the primary windings to neutral,
removing the short circuit from the transformer and allowing the secondary voltage to add to
the mains input voltage to provide a boosted output voltage through the hot output line of the
secondary windings side of the transformer. The voltage may be increased to the
predetermined voltage. The secondary windings are not switched.
[0236]     During a second predetermined period of time, such as when blackout conditions
are anticipated, the DSP 10 controls the IGBT/FET-based device 1 shown in FIG. 1 to supply
an allocated amount of power, which may be predetermined. The DSP 10 and/or the
microprocessor 26' monitors power consumption, which may be displayed. When the power
consumption exceeds the allocated amount, the DSP 10 may shut off the power.
                                                60

[0237]      Alternatively, when the consumed power exceeds the allocated power, a signal
may be sent alerting the need to reduce power usage. In FIG. 20, signal module 100 is
connected with DSP 10 and may provide the signal. The signal may be audible, visible, or
other means. The signal module may be a buzzer module, although other modules are also
contemplated. Wirelessly controlled electrical outlets may be used to selectively reduce the
load in response to the signal. If the load has not been adequately reduced after a
predetermined amount of time, the DSP 10 may shut off power. The consumer may then
reduce some load, and initiate a command to turn the power back on. The command may be
initiated by changing the condition of a switch, including manually and/or wirelessly. If the
load has still not been adequately reduced after the power has been restored, then the DSP
may again shut off the power. Alternatively, the DSP may provide another signal that may
again alert that the load must be reduced. If the consumed power is not reduced sufficiently
after a predetermined amount of time, then the DSP may shut off power through the hot
output line for the duration of the second predetermined time period.
[0238]      Further alternatively, when the consumed power exceeds the allocated power, the
DSP may shut off power to predetermined electrical outlets, while providing power to other
electrical outlets, to reduce the overall power usage to the allocated power amount. The
                                                  61

system may use wirelessly controlled electrical outlets that may be automatically shut-down
to meet the predetermined power amount. The system and method may use preset consumer
preferences to reduce the power consumed. The system may be monitored, operated and
adjusted wirelessly.
[0239]      Energy allocation, such as described above, allows consumers to enjoy electrical
power for key appliances rather than have no power at all. There are many times that this
action is necessary where there is insufficient electrical power for all consumers. Under such
conditions, the electrical company may desire to provide a reduced or allocated service to all
consumers, rather than provide service to some consumers and no service at all to others. The
consumer may become part of the solution rather than part of the problem.
[0240]      Through wireless communication there is the ability to communicate between
controllers, adapters, and input devices. The display device may utilize an off the shelf
computer, iPad, smart phone, or other input device using a keyboard, touch screen or
combination thereof Other devices are also contemplated. An iPad is available from Apple
Inc. of Cupertino, California. While an input device may be used to wirelessly monitor,
adjust settings, or adjust control parameters, the system may function completely on its own,
independent of the input device. Furthermore, the main unit may have full wireless
                                                  62

communications to enable remote control of the aforementioned power outlet and adapters.
The system may provide full lighting and environment control. The system may allow for a
consumer's power usage profile to be input and implemented for power allocation and
selective power reduction. The system and method may provide dynamic power allocation.
[0241]      As can now be understood, the system and method is a conservation power
management system that is installed at the point of consumption. The implementation does
not require any immediate increase in power generation, nor does it require any immediate
enhancement of the power grid. The solution uses an energy management system that saves
energy, reduces brown outs and blackouts, and manages usage to reduce costs to the
consumer and the electrical generating and distribution company. The management system
results in a reduction in copper losses, thereby releasing energy previously wasted as heat and
at a financial loss to the electrical company. The conserved energy can be provided to
additional consumers, thereby providing additional income to the electrical utility, at no
additional costs.
[0242]      The system and method have at least eight main features: (1) energy conservation
and user cost savings, (2) voltage stabilization, (3) uniform electricity costs to consumers, (4)
                                                  63

copper loss reduction, (5) hydrocarbon emission mitigation, (6) brownout mitigation, (7)
blackout mitigation, and (8) energy allocation.
[0243]      The system and method provide energy conservation and user cost savings.
Electrical power is typically delivered to the consumer at a nominal voltage of 120/127/230
Vrms. This is the target voltage that the electrical company aims to supply. This voltage can
disadvantageously fluctuate by plus or minus 10%, or more, within the power company
specification, often by a much greater margin. Appliance manufacturers, well aware of the
power shortcomings, design their appliances for the low (minus 10%) end of the supply
voltage and design the devices to withstand the high (plus 10%) end of the supplied voltage.
At the low end, the appliance will perform its task as specified. However, at any voltage
above the low voltage, the appliance will be over supplied and will waste electrical energy at
a cost to the consumer. The system and method minimize this situation. The invention
regulates the AC voltage at the selected low voltage, thereby saving energy.
[0244]      The system and method provide voltage stabilization. In extreme cases where the
delivered voltage falls below the low voltage, the system and method solve this problem by
boosting the incoming voltage, such as to allow the voltage regulation to occur. Unlike
voltage boosters that are available for single appliances, the boost section of the system
                                                  64

maintains the voltage at the low end for the whole home or business. Not only does this
improve the quality of service for the consumer, it also allows the removal of unsightly
boosters, used in some countries, from the vicinity of specific appliances so equipped.
[0245]     The system and method provide uniform electricity cost to consumers. In a typical
community, the consumers are charged inconsistently for the same amounts of electrical
power required, which is a result of inconsistent voltages being supplied to the community.
These losses result from copper losses. Electrical conductors impede the flow of electrical
current. This shortcoming of all conductors can be planned for, and larger copper conductors
can be employed. Increasing the size of the conductor reduces the copper losses.
Unfortunately, the existing power distribution networks were not designed to carry the power
needs of emerging economies where affluence is accompanied by the desire, on the part of
the consumer, to have appliances and entertainment systems to complement the improved life
style. The result is that for a community, the power delivered to the consumer closest to the
main electricity transformer, has a much higher voltage than that which is delivered to the
consumer furthermost removed from the transformer. This unfair situation results in the
consumer closest to the transformer paying for more energy than the consumer at the other
end, even if both consumers have identical appliances and a similar lifestyle. The product of
                                                 65

electrical voltage and current is watts, and higher voltage results in higher wattage. Wattage
per hour is what the consumer pays for. This unfair power situation may be resolved by the
system and method.
[0246]      The system and method provide copper loss reduction. Copper losses are the
cumulative power distribution losses experienced in all power distribution networks. In most
emerging economies the power distribution network is not capable of sustaining the loading
imposed when a community attempts to consume quantities of power that the network was
not designed for. This situation usually results from an increase in affluence, which is
generally accompanied by the ownership of consumer items like air conditioners, central
heating, televisions, washers, audio and improved lighting. When the feeder supplying power
to the homes in such a community experiences excessive loading, the electrical resistance,
present in all conductors, becomes significant, and a portion of the supplied voltage appears
across the resistance of the conductor. The product of this voltage together with the current
from many consumers causes a power loss (Watts) within the conductor that is dissipated as
heat. This represents a major loss of revenue to the electrical company. With the system and
method installed and implemented in the homes associated with this section of the network,
                                                  66

the power that was otherwise wasted may then be available to other consumers and may
result in an improved revenue stream to the electrical company.
 [0247]     The system and method provide hydrocarbon emission mitigation. Hydrocarbon
emissions exist when fossil fuels (oil, gas or coal) are used to generate electrical power. The
 system and method manage the power being consumed with considerable conservation, at the
point of consumption. The effect is twofold: first, a reduction in electrical energy results in a
reduction in fossil fuel being consumed with the attendant savings of carbon emissions; and
 second, this can defer the immediate need for additional generation capacity. Either way
benefits are accrued and directly affect the carbon bond situation in a positive way.
 [0248]     The system and method provide brownout mitigation. The system and method,
just by their implementation, mitigates this problem. However, associated with the system
and method is a feature where, at known times susceptible to brownout, the device can be
programmed to, automatically, apply an additional percentage of voltage reduction. Under
 such circumstances, the loading on the network is further reduced and results in further
copper loss reduction.
 [0249]     The system and method provide blackout mitigation. The times of blackouts are
usually well known to the electrical company. The system and method, at known times
                                                  67

susceptible to blackout, automatically monitor the power usage, alert the consumer, and
allocate the power such that every consumer gets their rationed amount.
[0250]      In one embodiment, when the set time is activated and the allocated wattage is
being exceeded, an audible warning device alerts the consumer to shed load. Sometime later,
if insufficient load has been shed, the system can be automatically shut down. At this point
the consumer can shed some load and then change the condition of a switch to bring the
system back on line. If insufficient load has been shed, the audible warning device will again
alert the consumer to shed more load. If the consumer does not respond, the system may be
set to shut down power for the remaining timed period. Other embodiments are
contemplated. Various scenarios can be invoked in accordance with the local situation,
desires, and needs of the electricity company, at their discretion. Furthermore, wirelessly
controlled electrical outlets can be utilized so that the appropriate devices can be
automatically shut-down to meet the required load shedding requirements in relation to the
allocated power.
[0251]      The system and method provide energy allocation. Energy allocation described
above allows consumers to enjoy electrical power for key appliances rather than have no
power at all. There are many times that this action is necessary where there is insufficient
                                                   68

electrical power to go around everyone. Under such a scenario, it is fair to provide a reduced
service to everyone to an allocated amount rather than provide service to some and no service
at all to others. Each consumer is part of the solution rather than part of the problem.
[0252]      It is to be understood that while embodiments are illustrated, they are not to be
limited to the specific form or arrangement of parts herein described and shown. It will be
apparent to those skilled in the art that various changes may be made without departing from
the scope of the invention and the invention is not be considered limited to what is shown and
described in the specification and drawings.
