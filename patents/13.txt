                                            ABSTRACT
Antibiotics (Abx) are the world's most misused drugs. Antibiotics misuse occurs when the drug
is administered in case of a non-bacterial infection (such as a viral infection) for which it is
ineffective. Overall, it is estimated that 40-70% of the worldwide Abx courses are mis
prescribed. The financial and health consequences of Abx over-prescription include the direct
cost of the drugs, as well as the indirect costs of their side effects, which are estimated at >$15
billion annually. Furthermore, over-prescription directly causes the emergence of Abx-resistant
strains of bacteria, which are recognized as one of the major threats to public health today. This
generates an immediate need for reliable diagnostics to assist physicians in correct Abx
prescription, especially at the point-of-care (POC) where most Abx are prescribed.
Accordingly, some aspects of the present invention provide methods using biomarkers for
rapidly detecting the source of infection and administrating the appropriate treatment.

2013217935, filed on 8 February 2013, and is related to International Patent Application No.

incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
                                  FIELD OF THE INVENTION
10002]       The present invention, in some embodiments thereof, relates generally to the
identification of biological signatures and determinants associated with bacterial and viral
infections and methods of using such biological signatures in the screening diagnosis, therapy,
and monitoring of infection.
                             BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
10003]       Antibiotics (Abx) are the world's most prescribed class of drugs with a 25-30 billion
$US global market. Abx are also the world's most misused drug with a significant fraction of all
drugs (40-70%) being wrongly prescribed (Linder, J.A. and R.S. Stafford 2001; Scott, J. G. and
D. Cohen, et al. 2001; Davey, P. and E. Brown, et al 2006; Cadieux, G. and R. Tamblyn, et al.
2007; Pulcini, C. and E. Cua, et al. 2007)'("CDC - Get Smart: Fast Facts About Antibiotic
Resistance" 2011).
10004]       One type of Abx misuse is when the drug is administered in case of a non-bacterial
disease, such as a viral infection, for which Abx is ineffective. For example, according to the
USA center for disease control and prevention CDC, over 60 Million wrong Abx prescriptions
are given annually to treat flu in the US. The health-care and economic consequences of the
Abx over-prescription include: (i) the cost of antibiotics that are unnecessarily prescribed
globally, estimated at >$ 10 billion annually; (ii) side effects resulting from unnecessary Abx
treatment are reducing quality of healthcare, causing complications and prolonged
hospitalization (e.g. allergic reactions, Abx associated diarrhea, intestinal yeast etc.) and (iii)
                                                   1

the emergence of resistant strains of bacteria as a result of the overuse (the CDC has declared
the rise in antibiotic resistance of bacteria as "one of the world's most pressing health problems
in the 21s" century" (Arias, C.A. and B.E. Murray 2009; "CDC - About Antimicrobial
Resistance" 2011)).
                                [TEXT CONTINUES ON PAGE 2]
                                                   la

100051        Antibiotics under-prescription is not uncommon either. For example up to 15% of adult
bacterial pneumonia hospitalized patients in the US receive delayed or no Abx treatment, even though in
these instances early treatment can save lives and reduce complications(Houck, P.M. and D. W. Bratzler,
et al 2002).
100061        Technologies for infectious disease diagnostics have the potential to reduce the associated
health and financial burden associated with Abx misuse. Ideally, such a technology should: (i) accurately
differentiate between a bacterial and viral infections; (ii) be rapid (within minutes); (iii) be able to
differentiate between pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacteria that are part of the body's natural flora; (iv)
differentiate between mixed co-infections and pure viral infections and (v) be applicable in cases where
the pathogen is inaccessible (e.g. sinusisits, pneumonia, otitis-media, bronchitis, etc).
100071        Current solutions (such as culture, PCR and immunoassays) do not fulfill all these
requirements: (i) Some of the assays yield poor diagnostic accuracy (e.g. low sensitivity or
specificity)(Uyeki et al. 2009), and are restricted to a limited set of bacterial or viral strains; (ii) they
often require hours to days; (iii) they do not distinguish between pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacteria
(Del Mar, C 1992), thus leading to false positives; (iv) they often fail to distinguish between a mixed and
a pure viral infections and (v) they require direct sampling of the infection site in which traces of the
disease causing agent are searched for, thus prohibiting the diagnosis in cases where the pathogen resides
in an inaccessible tissue, which is often the case.
100081        Consequentially, there still a diagnostic gap, which in turn often leads physicians to
either over-prescribe Abx (the "Just-in-case-approach"), or under-prescribe Abx (the "Wait-and
see-approach") (Little, P.S. and I. Williamson 1994; Little, P. 2005; Spiro, D. M. and K. Y. Tay,
et al 2006), both of which have far reaching health and financial consequences.
10009]        Accordingly, a need exists for a rapid method that accurately differentiates between
bacterial, viral, mixed and non-infectious disease patients that addresses these challenges.
                                  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
100010]       The present invention, in some embodiments thereof, is based on the identification of
signatures and determinants associated with bacterial, viral and mixed (i.e., bacterial and viral
co-infections) infections, patients with a non-infectious disease and healthy subjects. The
methods of the invention allow for the identification of type of infection a subject is suffering
from, which in turn allows for the selection of an appropriate treatment regimen. Various
                                                       2

embodiments of the invention address limitations of current diagnostic solutions by: (i) allowing
accurate diagnostics on a broad range of pathogens; (ii) enabling rapid diagnosis (within
minutes); (iii) insensitivity to the presence of non-pathogenic bacteria and viruses (thus reducing
the problem of false-positive); (iv) providing means for distinguishing between mixed from pure
viral infections, and (v) eliminating the need for direct sampling of the pathogen, thus enabling
diagnosis of inaccessible infections. Thus, some methods of the invention allow for the selection
of subjects for whom antibiotic treatment is desired and prevent unnecessary antibiotic treatment
of subjects having only a viral infection or a non-infectious disease. Some methods of the
invention also allow for the selection of subjects for whom anti-viral treatment is advantageous.
To develop and validate various aspects of the invention, the inventors conducted a large
prospective multi-center clinical trial enrolling 655 hospital patients with different types of
infections as well as controls (patients with a non-infectious disease and healthy individuals).
The inventors then performed meticulous molecular and biochemical experimentation and
measured the levels of over 570 polypeptides and other physiological determinants in these
patients using quantitative assays. They found that most determinants were not indicative of the
underlying infection type (e.g. bacterial, viral mixed and non-infectious disease). Moreover, even
determinants with a well-established immunological role in the host response to infection failed
to robustly distinguish between patients with different underlying infection types. Diverging
from this norm were a few unique determinants, which the inventors were able to identify, that
were able to differentiate between various types of infections.

to receive an anti-viral treatment regimen. When a subject is identified as having a non-viral
disease the subject is selected not to receive an anti-viral treatment regimen. When a subject is

prior to being treated for the infection and the second sample is taken from the subject after
being treated for the infection. In some aspects, the second sample is taken from the subject after
recurrence of the infection or prior to recurrence of the infection.

sample contains cells that include lymphocytes, monocytes and granulocytes. The expression
level of the polypeptide is determined by electrophoretically, or immunochemically. The
immunochemical detection is for example, by flow cytometry, radioimmunoassay,
immunofluorescence assay or by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.

the reference value or index value are determined after performing age dependent normalization
or stratification. In any of the above methods the DETERMINANTS are preferably selected such
that their MCC is >= 0.4 or the AUC is >= 0.7. In other aspects DETERMINANTS are
preferably selected such that their Wilcoxon rank sum p-values are less than 10-6 or less than 10-4

100087]     Different infectious agents have unique molecular patterns that can be identified and
targeted by the immune system. Pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) are an
example of such molecules that are associated with different groups of pathogens and may be
recognized by cells of the innate immune system using Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and other
                                                 15

pattern recognition receptors (e.g. NOD proteins) (Akira, S. and S. Uematsu, et al 2006; Murphy,
K. and P. Travers, et al 2007). These patterns may vary considerably between different classes of
pathogens and thus elicit different immune responses. For example, TLR-4 can recognize
lipopolysaccharide, a constituent of gram negative bacteria, as well as lipoteichoic acids,
constituent of gram positive bacteria, hence promoting an anti-microbial response of the immune
system (Akira, S. and S. Uematsu, et al 2006; Murphy, K. and P. Travers, et al 2007). TLR-3 can
recognize single stranded RNA (often indicative of a viral infection) and thus prompt the
appropriate anti-viral response(Akira, S. and S. Uematsu, et al 2006; Murphy, K. and P. Travers,
et al 2007). By distinguishing between different classes of pathogens (e.g bacterial versus viral)
the immune system can mount the appropriate defense.
100088]      In the past few decades, several host markers have been identified that can be used for
differential diagnosis of infection source in various indications. One example is Procalcitonin
(PCT), a precursor of the hormone calcitonin produced by the C-cells of the thyroid gland. PCT
levels in the blood stream of healthy individuals is hardly detectable (in the pg/ml range) but it
might increase dramatically, as a result of a severe infection with levels rising up to 100 ng/ml.
PCT is heavily used to diagnose patients with systemic infection, sepsis, with sensitivity of 76%
and specificity of 70%(Jones, A. E. and J.F. Fiechtl, et al 2007). However, studies that tested the
diagnostic value of PCT in other non-systemic infection such as pneumonia or upper respiratory
tract infections found it to be limited(Brunkhorst, F. M. and B. Al-Nawas, et al 2002; Tang M. P.
and Eslick GD 2007), especially when used in isolation.
100089]      Another widely used marker is the acute phase protein, C-reactive protein (CRP).
CRP levels in the blood often rise in response to inflammation. Therefore, when used as an
adjunct biomarker in the right clinical context, CRP may prove useful for improving detection
accuracy of infections (Povoa P. 2002). However, in some indications such as sepsis its
specificity and sensitivity were found to be considerably lower than PCT (Hatherill, M. and S.
M. Tibby, et al 1999). Additionally, its clinical utility as a stand-alone marker for Abx
prescription decision making has been criticized (Brian Clyne and Jonathan S Olshaker 1999).
One reason for CRP's limited accuracy in the context of infectious disease stems from the fact
that CRP may rise in indications other than bacterial infection. For example some viral infections
including adenoviruses (Appenzeller C et al. 2002; A. Putto, 0. Meurman, and 0. Ruuskanen
                                                  16

1986) are known to cause a significant increase in the levels of CRP that mimics a bacterial
response, thus limiting CRP's accuracy as a single marker for differentiating between viral and
bacterial infections. CRP may also rise in non-infectious disease such as trauma. Other proposed
markers for detection of different sources of infection and sepsis include CD64 (Rudensky, B.
and G. Sirota, et al 2008), and HNL (Fjaertoft, G. and T. Foucard, et al. 2005). The reliability
and evidence supporting the usage of these markers for the purpose of diagnostics of viral versus
bacterial infections in a broad setting are limited.
100090]      The present invention, in some embodiments thereof, seeks to overcome the above
mentioned diagnostic challenges by: (i) enabling accurate differentiation between a broad range
of bacterial versus viral infections; (ii) enabling rapid diagnostics (within minutes); (iii) avoiding
the "false positive" identification of non-pathogenic bacteria that are part of the body's natural
flora, (iv) allowing accurate differentiation between mixed and pure viral infections and (v)
allowing diagnosis in cases where the pathogen is inaccessible.
100091]      To this end the inventors sought to identify and test a novel set of biomarkers whose
levels are differentially expressed in viral, bacterial and mixed infected patients, and in patients
with a non-infectious disease and to use the combined measurements of these biomarkers
coupled with pattern recognition algorithms to accurately identify the source of infection with
the aim of assisting physicians to accurately prescribe the correct treatment.
100092]      To facilitate a solution that is generally applicable, the inventors performed a large
clinical trial in which they enrolled a heterogeneous cohort of 655 patients including different
ages, medical backgrounds, ethnicities, pathogen types, clinical syndromes and time from
appearance of symptoms, fever, co-morbidities (see Figures 4-10). The inventors then measured
the levels of over 570 different polypeptides using quantitative assays, and were able to screen a
small subset of polypeptides that was robustly differentially expressed in different types of
infections. They used the combined signature of these selected polypeptides to develop and test
various aspects of the present solution.
100093]      To address the challenge of rapid diagnosis, some aspects of the invention focus on
biomarkers that can be rapidly measured, such as proteins, rather than biomarkers whose
measurement may require hours to days, such as nucleic-acid based biomarkers. Note that high
throughput quantitative measurements of nucleic-acids for the purpose of biomarker discovery
                                                    17

have become feasible in recent years using technologies such as microarrays and deep
sequencing. However, performing such quantitative high-throughput measurements on the
proteome level remains a challenge. Thus, some aspects of the present invention focus on the
proteome level.
100094]      To address the clinical challenge of mixed infection diagnosis and treatment, some
aspects of the present invention include a method for differentiating between mixed infections
(which require Abx treatment despite the presence of a virus) and pure viral infections (which do
not require Abx treatment).
100095]      Some aspects of the present invention also address the challenge of "false-positive"
diagnostics due to non-pathogenic strains of bacteria that are part of the body's natural flora. This
is achieved by measuring biomarkers derived from the host rather than the pathogen.
100096]      Another aspect of the present invention enables the diagnosis of different infections,
which is invariant to the presence or absence of colonizers (e.g. bacteria and viruses that are part
of the natural flora). This addresses one of the major challenges in infectious disease diagnostics
today: "false-positives" due to colonizers.
100097]      Importantly, some aspects of the current invention do not require direct access to the
pathogen, because the immune system circulates in the entire body, thereby facilitating diagnosis
in cases in which the pathogen is inaccessible.
100098]      Another aspect of the present invention is the fraction in which the biomarkers are
measured, which affects the ease by which the assay can be performed in the clinical settings,
and especially the point-of-care. For example, it is easier to measure proteins in the serum or
plasma fraction compared to nucleic acids or intra-cellular proteins in the leukocytes fraction
(the latter requires an additional experimental step in which leukocytes are isolated from the
whole blood sample, washed and lysed). Accordingly, some aspects of the present invention also
describe serum and plasma based protein signatures that are easily measurable using various

100099]      Other aspects of the invention provide methods for identifying subjects who have an
infection by the detection of DETERMINANTS associated with an infection, including those
subjects who are asymptomatic for the infection. These signatures and DETERMINANTS are
also useful for monitoring subjects undergoing treatments and therapies for infection, and for
                                                  18

The polypeptide-DETERMINANT names presented herein are given by way of example. Many
alternative names, aliases, modifications, isoforms and variations will be apparent to those skilled
in the art. Accordingly, it is intended to embrace all the alternative protein names, aliases,
modifications isoforms and variations.
B2M: additional alias of B2M include without limitation beta-2-microglobulin and
CDABP0092. B2M is a component of MHC class I molecules, which are present on all
nucleated cells. The protein encoded by this gene also encodes an isoform present in the serum.
The protein has a predominantly beta-pleated sheet structure that can form amyloid fibrils in
some pathological conditions.
1000101]    BCA1: BCAl is a B lymphocyte chemoattractant, independently cloned and named
Angie, is a CXC chemokine strongly expressed in the follicles of the spleen, lymph nodes, and
Peyer's patches. It preferentially promotes the migration of B lymphocytes (compared to T cells
and macrophages), apparently by stimulating calcium influx into, and chemotaxis of, cells
expressing Burkitt's lymphoma receptor 1 (BLR-1). It may therefore function in the homing of B
lymphocytes to follicles(provided by RefSeq).
1000102]    CHI3L1: chitinase 3-like 1 (cartilage glycoprotein-39); additional aliases of CHI3L1
include without limitation ASRT7, CGP-39, GP-39, GP39, HC-gp39, HCGP-3P, YKL-40,
YKL40, YYL-40 and hCGP-39. Chitinases catalyze the hydrolysis of chitin, which is an
abundant glycopolymer found in insect exoskeletons and fungal cell walls. The glycoside
hydrolase 18 family of chitinases includes eight human family members. This gene encodes a
glycoprotein member of the glycosyl hydrolase 18 family that lacks chitinase activity can be
secreted by activated macrophages, chondrocytes, neutrophils and synovial cells. CHI3L1
inhibits oxidant-induced lung injury, augments adaptive Th2 immunity, regulates apoptosis,
stimulates alternative macrophage activation, and contributes to fibrosis and wound healing.
1000103]    Eotaxin: This gene is one of several Cys-Cys (CC) cytokine genes clustered on the q
arm of chromosome 17. Cytokines are a family of secreted proteins involved in
immunoregulatory and inflammatory processes. The CC cytokines are proteins characterized by
                                                 19

two adjacent cysteines. The cytokine encoded by this gene displays chemotactic activity for
eosinophils, but not mononuclear cells or neutrophils. This eosinophil specific chemokine
assumed to be involved in eosinophilic inflammatory diseases such as atopic dermatitis, allergic
rhinitis, asthma and parasitic infections (provided by RefSeq). In response to the presence of
allergens, this protein directly promotes the accumulation of eosinophils, a prominent feature of
allergic inflammatory reactions.
1000104]     IL1A: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the interleukin 1 cytokine
family. This cytokine is a pleiotropic cytokine involved in various immune responses,
inflammatory processes, and hematopoiesis. This cytokine can be produced by monocytes and
macrophages as a proprotein, which is proteolytically processed and released in response to cell
injury, and thus induces apoptosis. This gene and eight other interleukin 1 family genes form a
cytokine gene cluster on chromosome 2. IL-i proteins are involved in the inflammatory
response, being identified as endogenous pyrogens, and are reported to stimulate the release of
prostaglandin and collagenase from synovial cells.
1000105]     MCP: The protein encoded by this gene is a type I membrane protein and is a
regulatory part of the complement system. The encoded protein has cofactor activity for
inactivation of complement components C3b and C4b by serum factor I, which protects the host
cell from damage by complement. In addition, the encoded protein can act as a receptor for the
1000106]     Edmonston strain of measles virus, human herpesvirus-6, and type IV pili of
pathogenic Neisseria. The protein encoded by this gene may be involved in the fusion of the
spermatozoa with the oocyte during fertilization. Mutations at this locus have been associated
with susceptibility to hemolytic uremic syndrome. Alternatively spliced transcript variants
encoding different isoforms have been described (provided by RefSeq).
10001071     MAC-2-BP: Additional aliases of MAC-2-BP include without limitation
LGALS3BP, 90K, serum protein 90K, BTBD17B, M2BP and lectin, galactoside-binding,
soluble, 3 binding protein. The galectins are a family of beta-galactoside-binding proteins
implicated in modulating cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. The levels of MAC-2-BP were
found to be elevated in the serum of cancer patients. It appears to be implicated in immune
response associated with natural killer (NK) and lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cell
                                                 20

cytotoxicity. The native protein can bind specifically to a human macrophage-associated lectin
known as Mac-2 as well as galectin 1.
1000108]      CD62L: This gene encodes a cell surface adhesion molecule that belongs to a family
of adhesion/homing receptors. The encoded protein contains a C-type lectin-like domain, a
calcium-binding epidermal growth factor-like domain, and two short complement-like repeats.
The gene product is required for binding and subsequent rolling of leucocytes on endothelial
cells, facilitating their migration into secondary lymphoid organs and inflammation sites. Single
nucleotide polymorphisms in this gene have been associated with various diseases including
immunoglobulin A nephropathy. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found for
this gene (provided by RefSeq). The protein encoded by this gene has a soluble form denoted
sCD62L.
1000109]      VEGFR2: Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a major growth factor for
endothelial cells. This gene encodes one of the two receptors of the VEGF. This receptor, known
as kinase insert domain receptor, is a type III receptor tyrosine kinase. It functions as the main
mediator of VEGF-induced endothelial proliferation, survival, migration, tubular morphogenesis
and sprouting. The signaling and trafficking of this receptor are regulated by multiple factors,
including Rab GTPase, P2Y purine nucleotide receptor, integrin alphaVbeta3, T-cell protein
tyrosine phosphatase, etc.. Mutations of this gene are implicated in infantile capillary
hemangiomas (provided by RefSeq). The protein encoded by this gene has a soluble form
denoted sVEGFR2.
1000110]      TRAIL: The protein encoded by this gene is a cytokine that belongs to the tumor
necrosis factor (TNF) ligand family. Additional names of the gene include without limitations
APO2L, TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand, TNFSF1O and CD253. TRAIL exists in a
membrane bound form and a soluble form, both of which can induce apoptosis in different cells,
such as transformed tumor cells. This protein binds to several members of the TNF receptor
superfamily such as TNFRSF1OA/TRAILR1, NFRSF1OB/TRAILR2, NFRSF1OC/TRAILR3,
TNFRSF1OD/TRAILR4, and possibly also to NFRSF1 1B/OPG. The activity of this protein may
be modulated by binding to the decoy receptors such as NFRSF1OC/TRAILR3,
TNFRSF1OD/TRAILR4, and NFRSF1 1B/OPG that cannot induce apoptosis. The binding of this
protein to its receptors has been shown to trigger the activation of MAPK8/JNK, caspase 8, and
                                                  21

caspase 3. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found
for this gene. TRAIL can be proteolytically cleaved from the cell surface to produce a soluble
form that has a homotrimeric structure.
1000111]     CHP: This gene encodes a phosphoprotein that binds to the Na+/H+ exchanger
NHE1. This protein serves as an essential cofactor which supports the physiological activity of
NHE family members and may play a role in the mitogenic regulation of NHEl. The protein
shares similarity with calcineurin B and calmodulin and it is also known to be an endogenous
inhibitor of calcineurin activity (provided by RefSeq).
1000112]     CMPK2: This gene encodes a protein that may participate in dUTP and dCTP
synthesis in mitochondria. Is able to phosphorylate dUMP, dCMP, CMP, UMP and
monophosphates of the pyrimidine nucleoside analogs ddC, dFdC, araC, BVDU and FdUrd with
ATP as phosphate donor. Efficacy is highest for dUMP followed by dCMP; CMP and UMP are
poor substrates. May be involved in mtDNA depletion caused by long term treatment with ddC
or other pyrimidine analogs.
1000113]     CORO1C: This gene encodes a member of the WD repeat protein family. WD
repeats are minimally conserved regions of approximately 40 amino acids typically bracketed by
gly-his and trp-asp (GH-WD), which may facilitate formation of heterotrimeric or multiprotein
complexes. Members of this family are involved in a variety of cellular processes, including cell
cycle progression, signal transduction, apoptosis, and gene regulation.
1000114]     EIF2AK2: EIF2AK2 is a protein serine/threonine kinase that acquires enzymatic
activity following autophosphorylation, a process mediated by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA).
Additional aliases include without limitation: PKR, PRKR, EIF2AK1, protein kinase, interferon
inducible double stranded RNA dependent, p68 kinase, etc. Activation of EIF2AK2 allows the
kinase to phosphorylate its natural substrate, the alpha subunit of eukaryotic protein synthesis
initiation factor-2 (EIF2-alpha; MIM 603907), leading to the inhibition of protein synthesis..
1000115]     ISG15: ISG15 ubiquitin-like modifier; additional aliases of ISG15 include without
limitation GlP2, IFI15, IP17, UCRP and hUCRP. This ubiquitin-like protein is conjugated to
intracellular target proteins after IFN-alpha or IFN-beta stimulation. Its enzymatic pathway is
partially distinct from that of ubiquitin, differing in substrate specificity and interaction with
ligating enzymes. ISG15 conjugation pathway uses a dedicated El enzyme, but seems to
                                                   22

converge with the Ub conjugation pathway at the level of a specific E2 enzyme. Targets include
STATIC, SERPINA3G/SPI2A, JAKI, MAPK3/ERK1, PLCG1, EIF2AK2/PKR, MX1/MxA, and
RIG- 1.. Shows specific chemotactic activity towards neutrophils and activates them to induce
release of eosinophil chemotactic factors. May serve as a trans-acting binding factor directing the
association of ligated target proteins to intermediate filaments. May also be involved in
autocrine, paracrine and endocrine mechanisms, as in cell-to-cell signaling, possibly partly by
inducing IFN-gamma secretion by monocytes and macrophages.
1000116]    RTN3: May be involved in membrane trafficking in the early secretory pathway.
Inhibits BACE1 activity and amyloid precursor protein processing. May induce caspase-8
cascade and apoptosis. May favor BCL2 translocation to the mitochondria upon endoplasmic
reticulum stress. In case of enteroviruses infection, RTN3 may be involved in the viral
replication or pathogenesis.
1000117]    CD112: This gene encodes a single-pass type I membrane glycoprotein with two Ig
like C2-type domains and an Ig-like V-type domain. This protein is one of the plasma membrane
components of adherens junctions. It also serves as an entry for certain mutant strains of herpes
simplex virus and pseudorabies virus, and it is involved in cell to cell spreading of these viruses.
Variations in this gene have been associated with differences in the severity of multiple sclerosis.
Alternate transcriptional splice variants, encoding different isoforms, have been characterized.
(provided by RefSeq).
1000118]    CD134: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the TNF-receptor
superfamily. This receptor has been shown to activate NF-kappaB through its interaction with
adaptor proteins TRAF2 and TRAF5. Knockout studies in mice suggested that this receptor
promotes the expression of apoptosis inhibitors BCL2 and BCL2lL1/BCL2-XL, and thus
suppresses apoptosis. The knockout studies also suggested the roles of this receptor in CD4+ T
cell response, as well as in T cell-dependent B cell proliferation and differentiation (provided by
RefSeq).
1000119]    CD182: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the G-protein-coupled
receptor family. This protein is a receptor for interleukin 8 (IL8). It binds to IL8 with high
affinity, and transduces the signal through a G-protein activated second messenger system. This
receptor also binds to chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1 (CXCL1/MGSA), a protein with
                                                  23

melanoma growth stimulating activity, and has been shown to be a major component required for
serum-dependent melanoma cell growth. This receptor mediates neutrophil migration to sites of
inflammation. The angiogenic effects of IL8 in intestinal microvascular endothelial cells are
found to be mediated by this receptor. Knockout studies in mice suggested that this receptor
controls the positioning of oligodendrocyte precursors in developing spinal cord by arresting
their migration. This gene, IL8RA, a gene encoding another high affinity IL8 receptor, as well as
IL8RBP, a pseudogene of IL8RB, form a gene cluster in a region mapped to chromosome 2q33
q36. Alternatively spliced variants, encoding the same protein, have been identified (provided by
RefSeq).
1000120]     CD231: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the transmembrane 4
superfamily, also known as the tetraspanin family. Most of these members are cell-surface
proteins that are characterized by the presence of four hydrophobic domains. The proteins
mediate signal transduction events that play a role in the regulation of cell development,
activation, growth and motility. This encoded protein is a cell surface glycoprotein and may have
a role in the control of neurite outgrowth. It is known to complex with integrins. This gene is
associated with X-linked mental retardation and neuropsychiatric diseases such as Huntington's
chorea, fragile X syndrome and myotonic dystrophy (provided by RefSeq).
1000121]     CD235a: CD235a is the major intrinsic membrane protein of the erythrocyte. The N
terminal glycosylated segment, which lies outside the erythrocyte membrane, has MN blood
group receptors. Appears to be important for the function of SLC4A1 and is required for high
activity of SLC4A1. May be involved in translocation of SLC4A1 to the plasma membrane. Is a
receptor for influenza virus. Is a receptor for Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte-binding antigen
175 (EBA-175); binding of EBA-175 is dependent on sialic acid residues of the O-linked
glycans. Appears to be a receptor for Hepatitis A virus (HAV).
1000122]     CD335: Cytotoxicity-activating receptor that may contribute to the increased
efficiency of activated natural killer(NK) cells to mediate tumor cell lysis.
1000123]     CD337: The protein encoded by this gene is a natural cytotoxicity receptor (NCR)
that may aid NK cells in the lysis of tumor cells. The encoded protein interacts with CD3-zeta
(CD247), a T-cell receptor. A single nucleotide polymorphism in the 5' untranslated region of
                                                   24

this gene has been associated with mild malaria suceptibility. Three transcript variants encoding
different isoforms have been found for this gene.
1000124]    CD45: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the protein tyrosine
phosphatase (PTP) family. PTPs are known to be signaling molecules that regulate a variety of
cellular processes including cell growth, differentiation, mitotic cycle, and oncogenic
transformation. This PTP contains an extracellular domain, a single transmembrane segment and
two tandem intracytoplasmic catalytic domains, and thus belongs to receptor type PTP. This
gene is specifically expressed in hematopoietic cells. This PTP has been shown to be an essential
regulator of T- and B-cell antigen receptor signaling. It functions through either direct interaction
with components of the antigen receptor complexes, or by activating various Src family kinases
required for the antigen receptor signaling. This PTP also suppresses JAK kinases, and thus
functions as a regulator of cytokine receptor signaling. Several alternatively spliced transcripts
variants of this gene, which encode distinct isoforms, have been reported.
1000125]    CD49d: The product of this gene belongs to the integrin alpha chain family of
proteins. Integrins are heterodimeric integral membrane proteins composed of an alpha chain and
a beta chain. This gene encodes an alpha 4 chain. Unlike other integrin alpha chains, alpha 4
neither contains an I-domain, nor undergoes disulfide-linked cleavage. Alpha 4 chain associates
with either beta 1 chain or beta 7 chain (provided by RefSeq).
1000126]    CD66a: This gene encodes a member of the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) gene
family, which belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily. Two subgroups of the CEA family,
the CEA cell adhesion molecules and the pregnancy-specific glycoproteins, are located within a
1.2 Mb cluster on the long arm of chromosome 19. Eleven pseudogenes of the CEA cell
adhesion molecule subgroup are also found in the cluster. The encoded protein was originally
described in bile ducts of liver as biliary glycoprotein. Subsequently, it was found to be a cell
cell adhesion molecule detected on leukocytes, epithelia, and endothelia. The encoded protein
mediates cell adhesion via homophilic as well as heterophilic binding to other proteins of the
subgroup. Multiple cellular activities have been attributed to the encoded protein, including roles
in the differentiation and arrangement of tissue three-dimensional structure, angiogenesis,
apoptosis, tumor suppression, metastasis, and the modulation of innate and adaptive immune
responses. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been reported.
                                                  25

1000127]     CD66c: Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA; MIM 114890) is one of the most widely
used tumor markers in serum immunoassay determinations of carcinoma. An apparent lack of
absolute cancer specificity for CEA probably results in part from the presence in normal and
neoplastic tissues of antigens that share antigenic determinants with the 180-kD form of CEA
(Barnett et al., 1988 (PubMed 3220478)). For background information on the CEA family of
genes, see CEACAMI (MIM 109770) (supplied by OMIM).
1000128]     CD66d: This gene encodes a member of the family of carcinoembryonic antigen
related cell adhesion molecules (CEACAMs), which are used by several bacterial pathogens to
bind and invade host cells. The encoded transmembrane protein directs phagocytosis of several
bacterial species that is dependent on the small GTPase Rac. It is thought to serve an important
role in controlling human-specific pathogens by the innate immune system. Alternatively spliced
transcript variants have been described, but their biological validity has not been determined
(provided by RefSeq).
1000129]     CD66e: CD66e, a member of the CEACAM subfamily, serves as a surface
glycoprotein that plays a role in cell adhesion and in intracellular signaling. CD66e also serves a
receptor for E.coli Dr adhesins.
1000130]     CD84: CD84 plays a role as adhesion receptor functioning by homophilic
interactions and by clustering. Recruits SH2 domain-containing proteins SH2D 1A/SAP.
Increases proliferative responses of activated T-cells and SH2D lA/SAP does not seen be
required for this process. Homophilic interactions enhance interferon gamma/IFNG secretion in
lymphocytes and induce platelet stimulation via a SH2D lA/SAP-dependent pathway. CD84 may
also serve as a marker for hematopoietic progenitor cells
1000131]     EGFR: The protein encoded by this gene is a transmembrane glycoprotein that is a
member of the protein kinase superfamily. This protein is a receptor for members of the
epidermal growth factor family. EGFR is a cell surface protein that binds to epidermal growth
factor. Binding of the protein to a ligand induces receptor dimerization and tyrosine
autophosphorylation and leads to cell proliferation. Mutations in this gene are associated with
lung cancer. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants that encode different protein
isoforms have been found for this gene (provided by RefSeq).
                                                  26

1000132]    GPR162: This gene was identified upon genomic analysis of a gene-dense region at
human chromosome 12p 13. It appears to be mainly expressed in the brain; however, its function
is not known. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been
identified (provided by RefSeq).
1000133]    HLA-A: HLA-A belongs to the HLA class I heavy chain paralogues. This class I
molecule is a heterodimer consisting of a heavy chain and a light chain (beta-2 microglobulin).
The heavy chain is anchored in the membrane. Class I molecules play a central role in the
immune system by presenting peptides derived from the endoplasmic reticulum lumen. They are
expressed in nearly all cells. The heavy chain is approximately 45 kDa and its gene contains 8
exons. Exon 1 encodes the leader peptide, exons 2 and 3 encode the alphal and alpha2 domains,
which both bind the peptide, exon 4 encodes the alpha3 domain, exon 5 encodes the
transmembrane region, and exons 6 and 7 encode the cytoplasmic tail. Polymorphisms within
exon 2 and exon 3 are responsible for the peptide binding specificity of each class one molecule.
Typing for these polymorphisms is routinely done for bone marrow and kidney transplantation.
Hundreds of HLA-A alleles have been described (provided by RefSeq).
1000134]    HLA-B: HLA-B belongs to the HLA class I heavy chain paralogues. This class I
molecule is a heterodimer consisting of a heavy chain and a light chain (beta-2 microglobulin).

molecule is a heterodimer consisting of a heavy chain and a light chain (beta-2 microglobulin).
The heavy chain is anchored in the membrane. Class I molecules play a central role in the
immune system by presenting peptides derived from endoplasmic reticulum lumen. They are
                                                 27

expressed in nearly all cells. The heavy chain is approximately 45 kDa and its gene contains 8
exons. Exon one encodes the leader peptide, exons 2 and 3 encode the alphal and alpha2
domain, which both bind the peptide, exon 4 encodes the alpha3 domain, exon 5 encodes the
transmembrane region, and exons 6 and 7 encode the cytoplasmic tail. Polymorphisms within
exon 2 and exon 3 are responsible for the peptide binding specificity of each class one molecule.

Over one hundred HLA-C alleles have been described (provided by RefSeq).
1000136]     ITGAM: This gene encodes the integrin alpha M chain. Integrins are heterodimeric
integral membrane proteins composed of an alpha chain and a beta chain. This I-domain
containing alpha integrin combines with the beta 2 chain (ITGB2) to form a leukocyte-specific
integrin referred to as macrophage receptor 1 ('Mac-I'), or inactivated-C3b (iC3b) receptor 3
('CR3'). The alpha M beta 2 integrin is important in the adherence of neutrophils and monocytes
to stimulated endothelium, and also in the phagocytosis of complement coated particles. Multiple
transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene (provided by
RefSeq).
1000137]     NRG1: The protein encoded by this gene was originally identified as a 44-kD
glycoprotein that interacts with the NEU/ERBB2 receptor tyrosine kinase to increase its
phosphorylation on tyrosine residues. This protein is a signaling protein that mediates cell-cell
interactions and plays critical roles in the growth and development of multiple organ systems. It
is known that an extraordinary variety of different isoforms are produced from this gene through
alternative promoter usage and splicing. These isoforms are tissue-specifically expressed and
differ significantly in their structure, and thereby these isoforms are classified into types I, II, III,
IV, V and VI. The gene dysregulation has been linked to diseases such as cancer, schizophrenia
and bipolar disorder (BPD)(provided by RefSeq).
1000138]     RAP1B: GTP-binding protein that possesses intrinsic GTPase activity. Contributes to
the polarizing activity of KRITl and CDH5 in the establishment and maintenance of correct
endothelial cell polarity and vascular lumen. Required for the localization of phosphorylated
PRKCZ, PARD3 and TIAM 1 to the cell junction.
1000139]     SELL: This gene encodes a selenoprotein, which contains a selenocysteine (Sec)
residue at its active site. The selenocysteine is encoded by the UGA codon that normally signals
                                                   28

translation termination. The 3' UTR of selenoprotein genes have a common stem-loop structure,
the see insertion sequence (SECIS), that is necessary for the recognition of UGA as a Sec codon
rather than as a stop signal (provided by RefSeq) .
1000140]      SPINT2: This gene encodes a transmembrane protein with two extracellular Kunitz
domains that inhibits a variety of serine proteases. The protein inhibits HGF activator which
prevents the formation of active hepatocyte growth factor. This gene is a putative tumor
suppressor, and mutations in this gene result in congenital sodium diarrhea. Multiple transcript
variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene (provided by RefSeq).
1000141]     EIF4B: Required for the binding of mRNA to ribosomes. Functions in close
association with EIF4-F and EIF4-A. It binds near the 5'-terminal cap of mRNA in the presence
of EIF-4F and ATP. It promotes the ATPase activity and the ATP-dependent RNA unwinding
activity of both EIF4-A and EIF4-F.

immunity to at least three major human pathogens, namely influenza A HiNi virus, West Nile
virus (WNV), and dengue virus (WNV), by inhibiting the early step(s) of replication.

RSAD2 include without limitation 2510004LOlRik, cig33, cig5 and vigil. RSAD2 can impair
virus budding by disrupting lipid rafts at the plasma membrane, a feature which is essential for
the budding process of many viruses. Acts through binding with and inactivating FPPS, an
enzyme involved in synthesis of cholesterol, farnesylated and geranylated proteins, ubiquinone
dolichol and heme.
1000145]     ADIPORi: ADIPORI is a receptor for globular and full-length adiponectin (APM1),
an essential hormone secreted by adipocytes that acts as an antidiabetic. It is probably involved
in metabolic pathways that regulate lipid metabolism such as fatty acid oxidation. It mediates
increased AMPK, PPARA ligand activity, fatty acid oxidation and glucose uptake by

1000146]    CD15 (FUT4): The product of this gene transfers fucose to N-acetyllactosamine
polysaccharides to generate fucosylated carbohydrate structures. It catalyzes the synthesis of the
non-sialylated antigen, Lewis x (CD15).
1000147]    CD73: The protein encoded by this gene is a plasma membrane protein that catalyzes
the conversion of extracellular nucleotides to membrane-permeable nucleosides. The encoded
protein is used as a determinant of lymphocyte differentiation. Defects in this gene can lead to
the calcification of joints and arteries. Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms have
been found for this gene.
1000148]    CD8A: The CD8 antigen is a cell surface glycoprotein found on most cytotoxic T
lymphocytes that mediates efficient cell-cell interactions within the immune system. The CD8
antigen acts as a corepressor with the T-cell receptor on the T lymphocyte to recognize antigens
displayed by an antigen presenting cell (APC) in the context of class I MHC molecules. The
coreceptor functions as either a homodimer composed of two alpha chains, or as a heterodimer
composed of one alpha and one beta chain. Both alpha and beta chains share significant
homology to immunoglobulin variable light chains. This gene encodes the CD8 alpha chain
isoforms. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene
(provided by RefSeq).

least three major human pathogens, namely influenza A HINI virus, West Nile virus, and
dengue virus by inhibiting the early step(s) of replication. Plays a key role in the antiproliferative
action of IFN-gamma either by inhibiting the ERK activition or by arresting cell growth in GI
phase in a p53-dependent manner. Implicated in the control of cell growth. Component of a
multimeric complex involved in the transduction of antiproliferative and homotypic adhesion
signals.
1000150]    IFITM3: IFN-induced antiviral protein that mediates cellular innate immunity to at
least three major human pathogens, namely influenza A HINI virus, West Nile virus (WNV),
and dengue virus (WNV), by inhibiting the early step(s) of replication.
1000151]    IL7R: The protein encoded by this gene is a receptor for interleukine 7 (IL7). The
function of this receptor requires the interleukin 2 receptor, gamma chain (IL2RG), which is a
common gamma chain shared by the receptors of various cytokines, including interleukin 2, 4, 7,
                                                  30

9, and 15. This protein has been shown to play a critical role in the V(D)J recombination during
lymphocyte development. This protein is also found to control the accessibility of the TCR
gamma locus by STAT5 and histone acetylation. Knockout studies in mice suggested that
blocking apoptosis is an essential function of this protein during differentiation and activation of
T lymphocytes. The functional defects in this protein may be associated with the pathogenesis of
the severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID).
1000152]    CRP: C-reactive protein; additional aliases of CRP include without limitation RP 11
419N 10.4 and PTX1. The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the pentaxin family. It is
involved in several host defense related functions based on its ability to recognize foreign
pathogens and damaged cells of the host and to initiate their elimination by interacting with
humoral and cellular effector systems in the blood. Consequently, the level of this protein in
plasma increases greatly during acute phase response to tissue injury, infection, or other
inflammatory stimuli. CRP displays several functions associated with host defense: it promotes
agglutination, bacterial capsular swelling, phagocytosis and complement fixation through its
calcium-dependent binding to phosphorylcholine.
1000153]    TREM1: Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 1; additional aliases of
TREMI are CD354 and TREM-1 .This gene encodes a receptor belonging to the Ig superfamily
that is expressed on myeloid cells. This protein amplifies neutrophil and monocyte-mediated
inflammatory responses triggered by bacterial and fungal infections by stimulating release of
pro-inflammatory chemokines and cytokines, as well as increased surface expression of cell
activation markers. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have
been noted for this gene. The protein encoded by this gene has a soluble form which is denoted
by sTREM 1.
1000154]    PCT; Procalcitonin (PCT) is a peptide precursor of the hormone calcitonin, the latter being
involved with calcium homeostasis. The levels of procalcitonin rise in a response to a proinflammatory
stimulus.
1000155]    SAA: encodes a member of the serum amyloid A family of apolipoproteins. The
encoded protein is a major acute phase protein that is highly expressed in response to
inflammation and tissue injury. This protein also plays an important role in HDL metabolism and
cholesterol homeostasis. High levels of this protein are associated with chronic inflammatory
                                                   31

diseases including atherosclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, Alzheimer's disease and Crohn s disease.
This protein may also be a potential biomarker for certain tumors. Alternate splicing results in
multiple transcript variants that encode the same protein.
1000156]     IL6: This gene encodes a cytokine that functions in inflammation and the maturation
of B cells. In addition, the encoded protein has been shown to be an endogenous pyrogen capable
of inducing fever in people with autoimmune diseases or infections. The protein is primarily
produced at sites of acute and chronic inflammation, where it is secreted into the serum and
induces a transcriptional inflammatory response through interleukin 6 receptor, alpha. The
functioning of this gene is implicated in a wide variety of inflammation-associated disease states,
including suspectibility to diabetes mellitus and systemic juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (provided
by RefSeq).
1000157]     ARG1: Arginase catalyzes the hydrolysis of arginine to ornithine and urea. At least
two isoforms of mammalian arginase exist (types I and II) which differ in their tissue
distribution, subcellular localization, immunologic crossreactivity and physiologic function. The
type I isoform encoded by this gene, is a cytosolic enzyme and expressed predominantly in the
liver as a component of the urea cycle. Inherited deficiency of this enzyme results in
argininemia, an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by hyperammonemia (provided by
RefSeq).
1000158]     ARPC2: This gene encodes one of seven subunits of the human Arp2/3 protein
complex. The Arp2/3 protein complex has been implicated in the control of actin polymerization
in cells and has been conserved through evolution. The exact role of the protein encoded by this
gene, the p34 subunit, has yet to be determined. Two alternatively spliced variants have been
characterized to date. Additional alternatively spliced variants have been described but their full
length nature has not been determined (provided by RefSeq).
1000159]     ATP6VOB: H-ATPase (vacuolar ATPase, V-ATPase) is an enzyme transporter that
functions to acidify intracellular compartments in eukaryotic cells. It is ubiquitously expressed
and is present in endomembrane organelles such as vacuoles, lysosomes, endosomes, the Golgi
apparatus, chromaffin granules and coated vesicles, as well as in the plasma membrane. H+
ATPase is a multi-subunit complex composed of two domains. The VI domain is responsible for
ATP hydrolysis and the VO domain is responsible for protein translocation. There are two main
                                                 32

mechanisms of regulating H-ATPase activity; recycling of H-ATPase-containing vesicles to
and from the plasma membrane and glucose-sensitive assembly/disassembly of the holo-enzyme
complex. These transporters play an important role in processes such as receptor-mediated
endocytosis, protein degradation and coupled transport. They have a function in bone
reabsorption and mutations in the A3 gene cause recessive osteopetrosis. Furthermore, H+
ATPases have been implicated in tumor metastasis and regulation of sperm motility and
maturation.
1000160]     BRI3BP: Involved in tumorigenesis and may function by stabilizing p53/TP53.
1000161]     CCL19: This gene is one of several CC cytokine genes clustered on the p-arm of
chromosome 9. Cytokines are a family of secreted proteins involved in immunoregulatory and
inflammatory processes. The CC cytokines are proteins characterized by two adjacent cysteines.
The cytokine encoded by this gene may play a role in normal lymphocyte recirculation and
homing. It also plays an important role in trafficking of T cells in thymus, and in T cell and B
cell migration to secondary lymphoid organs. It specifically binds to chemokine receptor CCR7
(provided by RefSeq).
1000162]     CES1: Involved in the detoxification of xenobiotics and in the activation of ester and
amide prodrugs. Hydrolyzes aromatic and aliphatic esters, but has no catalytic activity toward
amides or a fatty acyl-CoA ester. Hydrolyzes the methyl ester group of cocaine to form
benzoylecgonine. Catalyzes the transesterification of cocaine to form cocaethylene. Displays
fatty acid ethyl ester synthase activity, catalyzing the ethyl esterification of oleic acid to
ethyloleate.
1000163]     CORO1A : May be a crucial component of the cytoskeleton of highly motile cells,
functioning both in the invagination of large pieces of plasma membrane, as well as in forming
protrusions of the plasma membrane involved in cell locomotion. In mycobacteria-infected cells,
its retention on the phagosomal membrane prevents fusion between phagosomes and lysosomes.
1000164]     HERC5: Major E3 ligase for ISG15 conjugation. Acts as a positive regulator of
innate antiviral response in cells induced by interferon. Makes part of the ISGylation machinery
that recognizes target proteins in a broad and relatively non-specific manner. Catalyzes
ISGylation of IRF3 which results in sustained activation. It attenuates IRF3-PIN1 interaction,
which antagonizes IRF3 ubiquitination and degradation, and boosts the antiviral response.
                                                   33

Catalyzes ISGylation of influenza A viral NS 1 which attenuates virulence; ISGylated NS 1 fails
to form homodimers and thus to interact with its RNA targets. It catalyzes ISGylation of
papillomavirus type 16 LI protein which results in dominant-negative effect on virus infectivity.
Physically associated with polyribosomes, broadly modifies newly synthesized proteins in a co
translational manner. In an interferon-stimulated cell, newly translated viral proteins are primary
targets of ISG15.
1000165]    1FI6: This gene was first identified as one of the many genes induced by interferon.
The encoded protein may play a critical role in the regulation of apoptosis. A mini satellite that
consists of 26 repeats of a 12 nucleotide repeating element resembling the mammalian splice
donor consensus sequence begins near the end of the second exon. Alternatively spliced
transcript variants that encode different isoforms by using the two downstream repeat units as
splice donor sites have been described.
1000166]    IFIT3: Additional aliases of the protein include without limitation: interferon
induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 3, IF160, ISG60 and Interferon-induced 60 kDa
protein.
1000167]    MBOAT2: Acyltransferase which mediates the conversion of lysophosphatidyl
ethanolamine (1-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine or LPE) into phosphatidyl
ethanolamine (1,2-diacyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine or PE) (LPEAT activity). Catalyzes
also the acylation of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) into phosphatidic acid (PA) (LPAAT activity).
Has also a very weak lysophosphatidyl-choline acyltransferase (LPCAT activity). Prefers oleoyl
CoA as the acyl donor. Lysophospholipid acyltransferases (LPLATs) catalyze the reacylation
step of the phospholipid remodeling pathway also known as the Lands cycle.
1000168]    MX1/MXA: myxovirus (influenza virus) resistance 1; additional aliases of MX1
include without limitation IFI-78K, IF178, MIX and MxA. In mouse, the interferon-inducible Mx
protein is responsible for a specific antiviral state against influenza virus infection. The protein
encoded by this gene is similar to the mouse protein as determined by its antigenic relatedness,
induction conditions, physicochemical properties, and amino acid analysis. This cytoplasmic
protein is a member of both the dynamin family and the family of large GTPases.
1000169]    OAS2: This gene encodes a member of the 2-5A synthetase family, essential proteins
involved in the innate immune response to viral infection. The encoded protein is induced by
                                                    34

interferons and uses adenosine triphosphate in 2'-specific nucleotidyl transfer reactions to
synthesize 2',5'-oligoadenylates (2-5As). These molecules activate latent RNase L, which results
in viral RNA degradation and the inhibition of viral replication. The three known members of
this gene family are located in a cluster on chromosome 12. Alternatively spliced transcript
variants encoding different isoforms have been described.
10001701      KIAA0082 (FTSJD2): S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent methyltransferase that
mediates mRNA cap1 2'-O-ribose methylation to the 5'-cap structure of mRNAs. Methylates the
ribose of the first nucleotide of a m(7)GpppG-capped mRNA to produce m(7)GpppNmp (cap 1).
CapI modification is linked to higher levels of translation. May be involved in the interferon
1000171]      LIPT1: The process of transferring lipoic acid to proteins is a two-step process. The
first step is the activation of lipoic acid by lipoate-activating enzyme to form lipoyl-AMP. For
the second step, the protein encoded by this gene transfers the lipoyl moiety to apoproteins.
Alternative splicing in the 5' UTR of this gene results in five transcript variants that encode the
same protein. (provided by RefSeq)
1000172]      LRDD: The protein encoded by this gene contains a leucine-rich repeat and a death
domain. This protein has been shown to interact with other death domain proteins, such as Fas
(TNFRSF6)-associated via death domain (FADD) and MAP-kinase activating death domain
containing protein (MADD), and thus may function as an adaptor protein in cell death-related
signaling processes. The expression of the mouse counterpart of this gene has been found to be
positively regulated by the tumor suppressor p53 and to induce cell apoptosis in response to
DNA damage, which suggests a role for this gene as an effector of p53-dependent apoptosis.
Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.
1000173]      MCP-2: This gene is one of several cytokine genes clustered on the q-arm of
chromosome 17. Cytokines are a family of secreted proteins involved in immunoregulatory and
inflammatory processes. The protein encoded by this gene is structurally related to the CXC
subfamily of cytokines. Members of this subfamily are characterized by two cysteines separated
by a single amino acid. This cytokine displays chemotactic activity for monocytes, lymphocytes,
basophils and eosinophils. By recruiting leukocytes to sites of inflammation this cytokine may
contribute to tumor-associated leukocyte infiltration and to the antiviral state against HIV
infection (provided by RefSeq).
                                                    35

1000174]     PARP9: Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) catalyzes the post-translational
modification of proteins by the addition of multiple ADP-ribose moieties. PARP transfers ADP
ribose from nicotinamide dinucleotide (NAD) to glu/asp residues on the substrate protein, and
also polymerizes ADP-ribose to form long/branched chain polymers. PARP inhibitors are being
developed for use in a number of pathologies including cancer, diabetes, stroke and
cardiovascular diseases.
1000175]     PTEN: Tumor suppressor. Acts as a dual-specificity protein phosphatase,
ephosphorylating tyrosine-, serine- and threonine-phosphorylated proteins. Also acts as a lipid
phosphatase, removing the phosphate in the D3 position of the inositol ring from
phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3,4,5-trisphosphate, PI 3,4-diphosphate, PI 3-phosphate and inositol
1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate with order of substrate preference in vitro Ptdlns(3,4,5)P3 >
Ptdlns(3,4)P2 > PtdIns3P > Ins(1,3,4,5)P4. The lipid phosphatase activity is critical for its tumor
suppressor function. Antagonizes the PI3K-AKT/PKB signaling pathway by dephosphorylating
phosphoinositides and thereby modulating cell cycle progression and cell survival. The un
phosphorylated form cooperates with AIPI to suppress AKT1 activation. Dephosphorylates
tyrosine-phosphorylated focal adhesion kinase and inhibits cell migration and integrin-mediated
cell spreading and focal adhesion formation. Plays a role as a key modulator of the AKT-mTOR
signaling pathway controlling the tempo of the process of newborn neurons integration during
adult neurogenesis, including correct neuron positioning, dendritic development and synapse
formation. May be a negative regulator of insulin signaling and glucose metabolism in adipose
tissue. The nuclear monoubiquitinated form possesses greater apoptotic potential, whereas the
cytoplasmic nonubiquitinated form induces less tumor suppressive ability.
1000176]     OARS: Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases catalyze the aminoacylation of tRNA by their
cognate amino acid. Because of their central role in linking amino acids with nucleotide triplets
contained in tRNAs, aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are thought to be among the first proteins that
appeared in evolution. In metazoans, 9 aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases specific for glutamine (gln),
glutamic acid (glu), and 7 other amino acids are associated within a multienzyme complex.
Although present in eukaryotes, glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase (QARS) is absent from many
prokaryotes, mitochondria, and chloroplasts, in which Gln-tRNA(Gln) is formed by
                                                 36

transamidation of the misacylated Glu-tRNA(Gln). Glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase belongs to the
class-I aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase family.
1000177]     RAB13: could participate in polarized transport, in the assembly and/or the activity
of tight junctions.
1000178]     RPL34: Ribosomes, the organelles that catalyze protein synthesis, consist of a small
40S subunit and a large 60S subunit. Together these subunits are composed of 4 RNA species
and approximately 80 structurally distinct proteins. This gene encodes a ribosomal protein that is
a component of the 60S subunit. The protein belongs to the L34E family of ribosomal proteins. It
is located in the cytoplasm. This gene originally was thought to be located at 17q2 1, but it has
been mapped to 4q. Transcript variants derived from alternative splicing, alternative transcription
initiation sites, and/or alternative polyadenylation exist; these variants encode the same protein.
As is typical for genes encoding ribosomal proteins, there are multiple processed pseudogenes of
this gene dispersed through the genome.
1000179]     SART3: The protein encoded by this gene is an RNA-binding nuclear protein that is
a tumor-rejection antigen. This antigen possesses tumor epitopes capable of inducing HLA-A24
restricted and tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes in cancer patients and may be useful for
specific immunotherapy. This gene product is found to be an important cellular factor for HIV-1
gene expression and viral replication. It also associates transiently with U6 and U4/U6 snRNPs
during the recycling phase of the spliceosome cycle. This encoded protein is thought to be
involved in the regulation of mRNA splicing.
1000180]     TRIM22: Interferon-induced antiviral protein involved in cell innate immunity. The
antiviral activity could in part be mediated by TRIM22-dependent ubiquitination of viral
proteins. Plays a role in restricting the replication of HIV-1, encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV)
and hepatitis B virus (HBV). Acts as a transcriptional repressor of HBV core promoter. May
have E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase activity.
1000181]     UBE2N: The UBE2V1-UBE2N and UBE2V2-UBE2N heterodimers catalyze the
synthesis of non-canonical 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitin chains. This type of polyubiquitination
does not lead to protein degradation by the proteasome. It mediates transcriptional activation of
target genes. It plays a role in the control of progress through the cell cycle and differentiation.
Plays a role in the error-free DNA repair pathway and contributes to the survival of cells after
                                                    37

DNA damage. Acts together with the E3 ligases, HLTF and SHPRH, in the 'Lys-63'-linked poly
ubiquitination of PCNA upon genotoxic stress, which is required for DNA repair. It appears to
act together with E3 ligase RNF5 in the 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitination of JKAMP thereby
regulating JKAMP function by decreasing its association with components of the proteasome
and ERAD.
1000182]     XAF1: Seems to function as a negative regulator of members of the IAP (inhibitor of
apoptosis protein) family. Inhibits anti-caspase activity of BIRC4. Induces cleavage and
inactivation of BIRC4 independent of caspase activation. Mediates TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis
and is involved in apoptosis in trophoblast cells. May inhibit BIRC4 indirectly by activating the
mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. After translocation to mitochondra, promotes translocation of
BAX to mitochondria and cytochrome c release from mitochondria. Seems to promote the
redistribution of BIRC4 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, probably independent of BIRC4
inactivation which seems to occur in the cytoplasm. The BIRC4-XAFl complex mediates down
regulation of BIRC5/survivin; the process requires the E3 ligase activity of BIRC4. Seems to be
involved in cellular sensitivity to the proapoptotic actions of TRAIL. May be a tumor suppressor
by mediating apoptosis resistance of cancer cells.
1000183]     ZBP1: DLM1 encodes a Z-DNA binding protein. Z-DNA formation is a dynamic
process, largely controlled by the amount of supercoiling. May play a role in host defense against
tumors and pathogens. Binds Z-DNA (By similarity).
1000184]     IL11: The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the gpl30 family of
cytokines. These cytokines drive the assembly of multisubunit receptor complexes, all of which
contain at least one molecule of the transmembrane signaling receptor IL6ST (gp130). This
cytokine is shown to stimulate the T-cell-dependent development of immunoglobulin-producing
B cells. It is also found to support the proliferation of hematopoietic stem cells and
megakaryocyte progenitor cells.
1000185]     IL1RA: The protein encoded by this gene is a cytokine receptor that belongs to the
interleukin 1 receptor family. This protein is a receptor for interleukin alpha (ILlA), interleukin
beta (ILIB), and interleukin 1 receptor, type I (ILIRI/ILIRA).        It is an important mediator
involved in many cytokine induced immune and inflammatory responses. Additional names of

1000186]     IP10: This gene encodes a chemokine of the CXC subfamily and ligand for the
receptor CXCR3. Binding of this protein to CXCR3 results in pleiotropic effects, including
stimulation of monocytes, natural killer and T-cell migration, and modulation of adhesion
molecule expression. Additional names of the gene include without limitations: CXCL10,
Gamma-IP 10, INP10 and chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 10.
1000187]     I-TAC: Chemotactic for interleukin-activated T-cells but not unstimulated T-cells,
neutrophils or monocytes. Induces calcium release in activated T-cells. Binds to CXCR3. May
play an important role in CNS diseases which involve T-cell recruitment. Additional names of
the gene include without limitations: SCYB 11, SCYB9B and CXCL11.
1000188]     TNFR1: Receptor for TNFSF2/TNF-alpha and homotrimeric TNFSFl/lymphotoxin
alpha. The adapter molecule FADD recruits caspase-8 to the activated receptor. The resulting
death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) performs caspase-8 proteolytic activation which
initiates the subsequent cascade of caspases (aspartate-specific cysteine proteases)       mediating
apoptosis. Additional names of the gene include without limitations: TNFRSFlA, TNFAR, p55,
p60, CD120a antigen and CD120a antigen.

derived neutrophil-activating peptide, Emoctakin, T-cell chemotactic factor,C-X-C motif chemokine 8, 3
1OC,Neutrophil-activating protein 1, AMCF-I and Protein 3-10C. This chemokine is one of the major
mediators of the inflammatory response. This chemokine is secreted by several cell types. It
functions as a chemoattractant, and is also a potent angiogenic factor. This gene is believed to
play a role in the pathogenesis of bronchiolitis, a common respiratory tract disease caused by
viral infection. This gene and other ten members of the CXC chemokine gene family form a
                                                     39

chemokine gene cluster in a region mapped to chromosome 4q. (provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008).
IL-8 is a chemotactic factor that attracts neutrophils, basophils, and T-cells, but not monocytes. It
is also involved in neutrophil activation. IL-8(6-77) has a 5-10-fold higher activity on neutrophil
activation, IL-8(5-77) has increased activity on neutrophil activation and IL-8(7-77) has a higher
affinity to receptors CXCR1 and CXCR2 as compared to IL-8(1-77), respectively.

DETERMINANTS" or "clinical DETERMINANTS".
1000193]     DETERMINANTS also include any calculated indices created mathematically or
combinations of any one or more of the foregoing measurements, including temporal trends and
differences. Where available, and unless otherwise described herein, DETERMINANTS, which
                                                  40

are gene products are identified based on the official letter abbreviation or gene symbol assigned
by the international Human Genome Organization Naming Committee (HGNC) and listed at the
date of this filing at the US National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) web site
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?db=gene ), also known as Entrez Gene.
1000194]    "Clinical-DETERMINANTS" encompass non-polypeptide, non-blood borne factors
or non-analyte physiological markers of health status including "clinical parameters" defined
herein, as well as "traditional laboratory risk factors", also defined herein.
1000195]    "Traditional laboratory risk factors" encompass biomarkers isolated or derived from
subject samples and which are currently evaluated in the clinical laboratory and used in
traditional global risk assessment algorithms, such as absolute neutrophil count (abbreviated
ANC), absolute lymphocyte count (abbreviated ALC), white blood count (abbreviated WBC),
neutrophil % (defined as the fraction of white blood cells that are neutrophils and abbreviated
Neu (%)), lymphocyte % (defined as the fraction of white blood cells that are lymphocytes and
abbreviated Lym (%)) , monocyte % (defined as the fraction of white blood cells that are
monocytes and abbreviated Mon (%)),Sodium (abbreviated Na), Potassium (abbreviated K),
Bilirubin (abbreviated Bili).
1000196]     "Clinical parameters" encompass all non-sample or non-analyte biomarkers of
subject health status or other characteristics, such as, without limitation, age (Age), ethnicity
(RACE), gender (Sex), core body temperature (abbreviated "temperature"), maximal core body
temperature since initial appearance of symptoms (abbreviated "maximal temperature"), time
from initial appearance of symptoms (abbreviated "time from symptoms") or family history
(abbreviated FamHX).
1000197]     "soluble-DETERMINANTS", "secreted-DETERMINANTS" and "soluble
polypeptides" are polypeptide-DETERMINANTS that exist outside the cellular interior in
different body fluids such as serum, plasma, urine, CSF, sputum, sweat, stool, seminal fluid, etc.
1000198]    "intracellular-DETERMINANTS", "intracellular proteins" and "intracellular
polypeptides" are polypeptides that are present within a cell.
1000199]    "membrane-DETERMINANTS", "membrane proteins" and "intracellular

1000200]    An "Infection Reference Expression Profile," is a set of values associated with two or
more DETERMINANTS resulting from evaluation of a biological sample (or population or set
of samples).
1000201]    A "Subject with non-infectious disease" is one whose disease is not caused by an
infectious disease agent (e.g. bacteria or virus). In the study presented herein this includes
patients with acute myocardial infarction, physical injury, epileptic attack etc.
1000202]    An "Acute Infection" is characterized by rapid onset of disease, a relatively brief
period of symptoms, and resolution within days.
1000203]    A "chronic infection" is an infection that develops slowly and lasts a long time.
Viruses that may cause a chronic infection include Hepatitis C and HIV. One difference between
acute and chronic infection is that during acute infection the immune system often produces
IgM+ antibodies against the infectious agent, whereas the chronic phase of the infection is
usually characteristic of IgM-/IgG+ antibodies. In addition, acute infections cause immune
mediated necrotic processes while chronic infections often cause inflammatory mediated fibrotic
processes and scaring (e.g. Hepatitis C in the liver). Thus, acute and chronic infections may elicit
different underlying immunological mechanisms.
1000204]    By infection type is meant to include bacterial infections, mixed infections, viral
infections, no infection, infectious or non-infectious.
1000205]    By "ruling in" an infection it is meant that the subject has that type of infection.
1000206]    By "ruling out" an infection it is meant that the subject does not have that type of
infection.
1000207]    The "natural flora", or "colonizers" refers to microorganisms, such as bacteria or
viruses, that may be present in healthy a-symptomatic subjects and in sick subjects.
1000208]    An "anti-viral treatment" includes the administration of a compound, drug, regimen
or an action that when performed by a subject with a viral infection can contribute to the
subject's recovery from the infection or to a relief from symptoms. Examples of anti-viral
treatments include without limitation the administration of the following drugs: oseltamivir,
RNAi antivirals, monoclonal antibody respigams, zanamivir, and neuriminidase blocking agents.
                                                   42

1000209]     "TP" is true positive, means positive test result that accurately reflects the tested-for
activity. For example in the context of the present invention a TP, is for example but not limited
to, truly classifying a bacterial infection as such.
1000210]     "TN" is true negative, means negative test result that accurately reflects the tested-for
activity. For example in the context of the present invention a TN, is for example but not limited
to, truly classifying a viral infection as such.
1000211]     "FN" is false negative, means a result that appears negative but fails to reveal a
situation. For example in the context of the present invention a FN, is for example but not
limited to, falsely classifying a bacterial infection as a viral infection.
1000212]     "FP" is false positive, means test result that is erroneously classified in a positive
category. For example in the context of the present invention a FP, is for example but not limited
to, falsely classifying a viral infection as a bacterial infection
1000213]     "Sensitivity" is calculated by TP/(TP+FN) or the true positive fraction of disease
subjects.
1000214]     "Specificity" is calculated by TN/(TN+FP) or the true negative fraction of non
disease or normal subjects.
1000215]     "Total accuracy" is calculated by (TN + TP)/(TN + FP +TP + FN).
1000216]     "Positive predictive value" or "PPV" is calculated by TP/(TP+FP) or the true positive
fraction of all positive test results. It is inherently impacted by the prevalence of the disease and
pre-test probability of the population intended to be tested.
1000217]     "Negative predictive value" or "NPV" is calculated by TN/(TN + FN) or the true
negative fraction of all negative test results. It also is inherently impacted by the prevalence of
the disease and pre-test probability of the population intended to be tested. See, e.g.,
O'Marcaigh AS, Jacobson RM, "Estimating The Predictive Value Of A Diagnostic Test, How
To Prevent Misleading Or Confusing Results," Clin. Ped. 1993, 32(8): 485-491, which discusses
specificity, sensitivity, and positive and negative predictive values of a test, e.g., a clinical
diagnostic test.
1000218]     "MCC" (Mathwes Correlation coefficient ) is calculated as follows: MCC = (TP           *
TN - FP * FN) / {(TP + FN) * (TP + FP) * (TN + FP) * (TN + FN)}^0.5
                                                     43

where TP, FP, TN, FN are true-positives, false-positives, true-negatives, and false-negatives,
respectively. Note that MCC values range between -1 to + 1, indicating completely wrong and
perfect classification, respectively. An MCC of 0 indicates random classification. MCC has been
shown to be a useful for combining sensitivity and specificity into a signle metric (Baldi, Brunak
et al. 2000). It is also useful for measuring and optimizing classification accuracy in cases of
unbalanced class sizes (Baldi, Brunak et al. 2000).
  1000219]     Often, for binary disease state classification approaches using a continuous diagnostic
  test measurement, the sensitivity and specificity is summarized by a Receiver Operating
  Characteristics (ROC) curve according to Pepe et al, "Limitations of the Odds Ratio in Gauging
  the Performance of a Diagnostic, Prognostic, or Screening Marker," Am. J. Epidemiol 2004, 159
  (9): 882-890, and summarized by the Area Under the Curve (AUC) or c-statistic, an indicator
  that allows representation of the sensitivity and specificity of a test, assay, or method over the
  entire range of test (or assay) cut points with just a single value. See also, e.g., Shultz, "Clinical
  Interpretation Of Laboratory Procedures," chapter 14 in Teitz, Fundamentals of Clinical
  Chemistry, Burtis and Ashwood (eds.), 4 edition 1996, W.B. Saunders Company, pages 192
  199; and Zweig et al., "ROC Curve Analysis: An Example Showing The Relationships Among
  Serum Lipid And Apolipoprotein Concentrations In Identifying Subjects With Coronory Artery
  Disease," Clin. Chem., 1992, 38(8): 1425-1428.        An alternative approach using likelihood
  functions, odds ratios, information theory, predictive values, calibration (including goodness-of
  fit), and reclassification measurements is summarized according to Cook, "Use and Misuse of
  the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve in Risk Prediction," Circulation 2007, 115: 928
  935.
  1000220]     "Accuracy" refers to the degree of conformity of a measured or calculated quantity (a
  test reported value) to its actual (or true) value. Clinical accuracy relates to the proportion of true
  outcomes (true positives (TP) or true negatives (TN) versus misclassified outcomes (false
  positives (FP) or false negatives (FN)), and may be stated as a sensitivity, specificity, positive
  predictive values (PPV) or negative predictive values (NPV), Matheus correlation coefficient
  (MCC), or as a likelihood, odds ratio, Receiver Operating Charachteristic (ROC) curve, Area
  Under the Curve (AUC) among other measures.

1000221]     A "formula," "algorithm," or "model" is any mathematical equation, algorithmic,
analytical or programmed process, or statistical technique that takes one or more continuous or
categorical inputs (herein called "parameters") and calculates an output value, sometimes
referred to as an "index" or "index value". Non-limiting examples of "formulas" include sums,
ratios, and regression operators, such as coefficients or exponents, biomarker value
transformations and normalizations (including, without limitation, those normalization schemes
based on clinical-DETERMINANTS, such as gender, age, or ethnicity), rules and guidelines,
statistical classification models, and neural networks trained on historical populations. Of
particular use in combining DETERMINANTS are linear and non-linear equations and statistical
classification analyses to determine the relationship between levels of DETERMINANTS
detected in a subject sample and the subject's probability of having an infection or a certain type
of infection. In panel and combination construction, of particular interest are structural and
syntactic statistical classification algorithms, and methods of index construction, utilizing pattern
recognition features, including established techniques such as cross-correlation, Principal
Components Analysis (PCA), factor rotation, Logistic Regression (LogReg), Linear
Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Eigengene Linear Discriminant Analysis (ELDA), Support Vector
Machines (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Recursive Partitioning Tree (RPART), as well as other
related decision tree classification techniques, Shrunken Centroids (SC), StepAIC, Kth-Nearest
Neighbor, Boosting, Decision Trees, Neural Networks, Bayesian Networks, and Hidden Markov
Models, among others. Other techniques may be used in survival and time to event hazard
analysis, including Cox, Weibull, Kaplan-Meier and Greenwood models well known to those of
skill in the art. Many of these techniques are useful either combined with a DETERMINANT
selection technique, such as forward selection, backwards selection, or stepwise selection,
complete enumeration of all potential panels of a given size, genetic algorithms, or they may
themselves include biomarker selection methodologies in their own technique. These may be
coupled with information criteria, such as Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) or Bayes
Information Criterion (BIC), in order to quantify the tradeoff between additional biomarkers and
model improvement, and to aid in minimizing overfit. The resulting predictive models may be
validated in other studies, or cross-validated in the study they were originally trained in, using
such techniques as Bootstrap, Leave-One-Out (LOO) and 10-Fold cross-validation (10-Fold
                                                   45

CV). At various steps, false discovery rates may be estimated by value permutation according to
techniques known in the art. A "health economic utility function" is a formula that is derived
from a combination of the expected probability of a range of clinical outcomes in an idealized
applicable patient population, both before and after the introduction of a diagnostic or therapeutic
intervention into the standard of care. It encompasses estimates of the accuracy, effectiveness
and performance characteristics of such intervention, and a cost and/or value measurement (a
utility) associated with each outcome, which may be derived from actual health system costs of
care (services, supplies, devices and drugs, etc.) and/or as an estimated acceptable value per
quality adjusted life year (QALY) resulting in each outcome. The sum, across all predicted
outcomes, of the product of the predicted population size for an outcome multiplied by the
respective outcome's expected utility is the total health economic utility of a given standard of
care. The difference between (i) the total health economic utility calculated for the standard of
care with the intervention versus (ii) the total health economic utility for the standard of care
without the intervention results in an overall measure of the health economic cost or value of the
intervention. This may itself be divided amongst the entire patient group being analyzed (or
solely amongst the intervention group) to arrive at a cost per unit intervention, and to guide such
decisions as market positioning, pricing, and assumptions of health system acceptance. Such
health economic utility functions are commonly used to compare the cost-effectiveness of the
intervention, but may also be transformed to estimate the acceptable value per QALY the health
care system is willing to pay, or the acceptable cost-effective clinical performance characteristics
required of a new intervention.
1000222]     For diagnostic (or prognostic) interventions of the invention, as each outcome (which
in a disease classifying diagnostic test may be a TP, FP, TN, or FN) bears a different cost, a
health economic utility function may preferentially favor sensitivity over specificity, or PPV
over NPV based on the clinical situation and individual outcome costs and value, and thus
provides another measure of health economic performance and value which may be different
from more direct clinical or analytical performance measures. These different measurements and
relative trade-offs generally will converge only in the case of a perfect test, with zero error rate
(a.k.a., zero predicted subject outcome misclassifications or FP and FN), which all performance
measures will favor over imperfection, but to differing degrees.
                                                   46

1000223]    "Measuring" or "measurement," or alternatively "detecting" or "detection," means
assessing the presence, absence, quantity or amount (which can be an effective amount) of either
a given substance within a clinical or subject-derived sample, including the derivation of
qualitative or quantitative concentration levels of such substances, or otherwise evaluating the
values or categorization of a subject's non-analyte clinical parameters or clinical
DETERMINANTS.
1000224]    "Analytical accuracy" refers to the reproducibility and predictability of the
measurement process itself, and may be summarized in such measurements as coefficients of
variation (CV), Pearson correlation, and tests of concordance and calibration of the same
samples or controls with different times, users, equipment and/or reagents. These and other
considerations in evaluating new biomarkers are also summarized in Vasan, 2006.
1000225]     "Performance" is a term that relates to the overall usefulness and quality of a
diagnostic or prognostic test, including, among others, clinical and analytical accuracy, other
analytical and process characteristics, such as use characteristics (e.g., stability, ease of use),
health economic value, and relative costs of components of the test. Any of these factors may be
the source of superior performance and thus usefulness of the test, and may be measured by
appropriate "performance metrics," such as AUC and MCC, time to result, shelf life, etc. as
relevant.
1000226]    A "sample" in the context of the present invention is a biological sample isolated
from a subject and can include, by way of example and not limitation, whole blood, serum,
plasma, saliva, mucus, breath, urine, CSF, sputum, sweat, stool, hair, seminal fluid, biopsy,
rhinorrhea, tissue biopsy, cytological sample, platelets, reticulocytes, leukocytes, epithelial cells,
or whole blood cells.
1000227]    By "statistically significant", it is meant that the alteration is greater than what might
be expected to happen by chance alone (which could be a "false positive"). Statistical
significance can be determined by any method known in the art. Commonly used measures of
significance include the p-value, which presents the probability of obtaining a result at least as
extreme as a given data point, assuming the data point was the result of chance alone. A result is
often considered highly significant at a p-value of 0.05 or less.
                                                   47

1000228]     A "subject" in the context of the present invention is preferably a human. A subject
can be male or female. A subject can be one who has been previously diagnosed or identified as
having an infection, and optionally has already undergone, or is undergoing, a therapeutic
intervention for the infection. Alternatively, a subject can also be one who has not been
previously diagnosed as having an infection. For example, a subject can be one who exhibits one
or more risk factors for having an infection.

Methods and Uses of the Invention
1000230] The methods disclosed herein are used to identify subjects with an infection or a
specific infection type. By type of infection it is meant to include bacterial infections, viral
infections, mixed infections, no infection (i.e., non-infectious) More specifically, some methods
of the invention are used to distinguish subjects having a bacterial infection, a viral infection, a
mixed infection (i.e., bacterial and viral co-infection), patients with a non-infectious disease and
healthy individuals. Some methods of the present invention can also be used to monitor or select
a treatment regimen for a subject who has a an infection, and to screen subjects who have not
been previously diagnosed as having an infection, such as subjects who exhibit risk factors
developing an infection. Some methods of the present invention are used to identify and/or
diagnose subjects who are asymptomatic for an infection. "Asymptomatic" means not exhibiting
the traditional signs and symptoms.
1000231]     The term "Gram-positive bacteria" are bacteria that are stained dark blue by Gram
staining. Gram-positive organisms are able to retain the crystal violet stain because of the high
amount of peptidoglycan in the cell wall.

1000232]     The term "Gram-negative bacteria" are bacteria that do not retain the crystal violet
dye in the Gram staining protocol.
1000233]     The term "Atypical bacteria" are bacteria that do not fall into one of the classical
"Gram" groups. They are usually, though not always, intracellular bacterial pathogens. They
include, without limitations, Mycoplasmas spp., Legionella spp. Rickettsiae spp., and
Chlamydiae spp.
1000234]     As used herein, infection is meant to include any infectious agent of viral or bacterial
origin. The bacterial infection may be the result of gram-positive, gram-negative bacteria or
atypical bacteria.
1000235]     A subject having an infection is identified by measuring the amounts (including the
presence or absence) of an effective number (which can be one or more) of DETERMINANTS
in a subject-derived sample. A clinically significant alteration in the level of the
DETERMINANT is determined. Alternatively, the amounts are compared to a reference value.
Alterations in the amounts and patterns of expression DETERMINANTS in the subject sample
compared to the reference value are then identified. In various embodiments, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten or more DETERMINANTS are measured. For example, the
combination of DETERMINANTS may be selected according to any of the models enumerated
in Tables 2-3.

subject with non-infectious disease or a healthy subject; a bacterially infected subject, from
either a subject with non-infectious disease or a healthy subject; a subject with an infectious
disease from either a subject with an non-infectious disease or a healthy subject; a bacterially
infected subject from a virally infected subject; a mixed infected subject from a virally infected
subject; a mixed infected subject from a bacterially infected subject and a bacterially or mixed
infected and subject from a virally infected subject.

1000261]    In specific embodiments the invention includes determining if a subject does not have
a bacterial infection (i.e. ruling out a bacterial infection). A bacterial infection is ruled out if the
polypeptide concentration of TRAIL determined is higher than a pre-determined first threshold
value. Optionally, the method further includes determining if a subject has a viral infection (i.e.,
                                                     54

ruling in a viral infection). A viral infection is rule in if the polypeptide concentration of TRAIL
is higher than a pre-determined second threshold value.
1000262]      In another specific embodiment the invention includes determining if a subject does
not have a viral infection (i.e. ruling out a viral infection). A viral infection is ruled out if the
polypeptide concentration of TRAIL determined is lower than a pre-determined first threshold
value. Optionally, the method further includes determining if a subject has a bacterial infection
(i.e., ruling in a bacterial infection). A bacterial infection is rule in if the polypeptide
concentration of TRAIL is lower than a pre-determined second threshold value.
1000263]      In other embodiments the invention includes a method of distinguishing between a
bacterial infection and a viral infection in a subject by measuring the polypeptide concentration
of TRAIL and CRP in a subject derived sample, applying a pre-determined mathematical
function on the concentrations of TRAIL and CRP to compute a score and comparing the score
to a predetermined reference value. Optionally, one or more of SAA, PCT, B2M Mac-2BP, ILIRA
or IP10 is measured.
1000264]      In another embodiment, the invention provides a method of distinguishing between a
bacterial or mixed infection, and a viral infection in a subject by measuring the polypeptide
concentration of TRAIL and CRP in a subject derived sample, applying a pre-determined
mathematical function on the concentrations of TRAIL and CRP to compute a score and
comparing the score to a predetermined reference value. Optionally, one or more of SAA, PCT,
B2M Mac-2BP, ILIRA or IP10 is measured.
1000265]      For example to distinguish between a bacterial infection and a viral infection or
bacterial or mixed infection, and a viral infection TRAIL, CRP and SAA are measured; TRAIL,
CRP and IP10 are measured; TRAIL, CRP and PCT are measured; TRAIL, CRP and ILIRA are
measured; TRAIL, CRP and B2M are measured; TRAIL, CRP and Mac-2BP are measured;
TRAIL, CRP, SAA and PCT are measured; TRAIL, CRP, Mac-2BP and SAA are measured;
TRAIL, CRP, SAA and IP1O are measured; TRAIL, CRP, SAA and ILiRA are measured;
TRAIL, CRP, SAA, PCT and IP1O are measured; TRAIL, CRP, SAA, PCT and ILiRA are
measured; or TRAIL, CRP, SAA, IP10 and ILIRA are measured.
1000266]      A reference value can be relative to a number or value derived from population
studies, including without limitation, such subjects having the same infection, subject having the
                                                    55

same or similar age range, subjects in the same or similar ethnic group, or relative to the starting
sample of a subject undergoing treatment for an infection. Such reference values can be derived
from statistical analyses and/or risk prediction data of populations obtained from mathematical
algorithms and computed indices of infection. Reference DETERMINANT indices can also be
constructed and used using algorithms and other methods of statistical and structural
classification.
1000267]     In one embodiment of the present invention, the reference value is the amount (i.e.
level) of DETERMINANTS in a control sample derived from one or more subjects who do not
have an infection (i.e., healthy, and or non-infectious individuals). In a further embodiment,
such subjects are monitored and/or periodically retested for a diagnostically relevant period of
time ("longitudinal studies") following such test to verify continued absence of infection. Such
period of time may be one day, two days, two to five days, five days, five to ten days, ten days,
or ten or more days from the initial testing date for determination of the reference value.
Furthermore, retrospective measurement of DETERMINANTS in properly banked historical
subject samples may be used in establishing these reference values, thus shortening the study
time required.
1000268]     A reference value can also comprise the amounts of DETERMINANTS derived from
subjects who show an improvement as a result of treatments and/or therapies for the infection. A
reference value can also comprise the amounts of DETERMINANTS derived from subjects who
have confirmed infection by known techniques.
1000269]     In another embodiment, the reference value is an index value or a baseline value. An
index value or baseline value is a composite sample of an effective amount of
DETERMINANTS from one or more subjects who do not have an infection. A baseline value
can also comprise the amounts of DETERMINANTS in a sample derived from a subject who has
shown an improvement in treatments or therapies for the infection. In this embodiment, to make
comparisons to the subject-derived sample, the amounts of DETERMINANTS are similarly
calculated and compared to the index value. Optionally, subjects identified as having an
infection, are chosen to receive a therapeutic regimen to slow the progression or eliminate the
infection.
                                                  56

1000270]      Additionally, the amount of the DETERMINANT can be measured in a test sample
and compared to the "normal control level," utilizing techniques such as reference limits,
discrimination limits, or risk defining thresholds to define cutoff points and abnormal values.
The "normal control level" means the level of one or more DETERMINANTS or combined
DETERMINANT indices typically found in a subject not suffering from an infection. Such
normal control level and cutoff points may vary based on whether a DETERMINANT is used
alone or in a formula combining with other DETERMINANTS into an index. Alternatively, the
normal control level can be a database of DETERMINANT patterns from previously tested
subjects.
1000271]      The effectiveness of a treatment regimen can be monitored by detecting a
DETERMINANT in an effective amount (which may be one or more) of samples obtained from
a subject over time and comparing the amount of DETERMINANTS detected. For example, a
first sample can be obtained prior to the subject receiving treatment and one or more subsequent
samples are taken after or during treatment of the subject.
1000272]      For example, the methods of the invention can be used to discriminate between
bacterial, viral and mixed infections (i.e. bacterial and viral co-infections.) This will allow
patients to be stratified and treated accordingly.
1000273]      In a specific embodiment of the invention a treatment recommendation (i.e., selecting a
treatment regimen) for a subject is provided by measuring the polypeptide concentration of TRAIL in a
subject derived sample; and recommending that the subject receives an antibiotic treatment if polypeptide
concentration of TRAIL is lower than a pre-determined threshold value; recommending that the patient
does not receive an antibiotic treatment if the polypeptide concentration of TRAIL is higher than a pre
determined threshold value; or recommending that the patient receive an anti-viral treatment if the
polypeptide concentration of TRAIL determined in step (a) is higher than a pre-determined threshold
value.
1000274]      In another specific embodiment of the invention a treatment recommendation (i.e., selecting
a treatment regimen) for a subject is provided by identifying the type infection (i.e., bacterial, viral,
mixed infection or no infection) in the subject according to the method of any of the disclosed methods
and recommending that the subject receive an antibiotic treatment if the subject is identified as having
bacterial infection or a mixed infection; or an anti- viral treatment is if the subject is identified as having a
viral infection.
                                                       57

1000275]      In another embodiment, the methods of the invention can be used to prompt
additional targeted diagnosis such as pathogen specific PCRs, chest-X-ray, cultures etc. For
example, a reference value that indicates a viral infection, may prompt the usage of additional
viral specific multiplex-PCRs, whereas a reference value that indicates a bacterial infection may
prompt the usage of a bacterial specific multiplex-PCR. Thus, one can reduce the costs of
unwarranted expensive diagnostics.
1000276]      In a specific embodiment, a diagnostic test recommendation for a subject is provided by
measuring the polypeptide concentration of TRAIL in a subject derived sample; and recommending
testing the sample for a bacteria if the polypeptide concentration of TRAIL is lower than a pre-determined
threshold value; or recommending testing the sample for a virus if the polypeptide concentration of
TRAIL is higher than a pre-determined threshold value.
1000277]      In another specific embodiment, a diagnostic test recommendation for a subject is provided
by identifying the infection type (i.e., bacterial, viral, mixed infection or no infection) in the subject
according to any of the disclosed methods and
1000278]      Recommending a test to determine the source of the bacterial infection if the subject is
identified as having a bacterial infection or a mixed infection; or a test to determine the source of the
viral infection if the subject is identified as having a viral infection.

1000280]      Some aspects of the present invention also comprise a kit with a detection reagent that
binds to one or more DETERMINANT. Also provided by the invention is an array of detection
reagents, e.g., antibodies that can bind to one or more DETERMINANT-polypeptides. In one

1000281]     Preferably, the concentration of the polypeptide-DETERMINANTS is measured within
about 24 hours after sample is obtained. Alternatively, the concentration of the polypeptide
DETERMINANTS measured in a sample that was stored at 120C or lower, when storage begins
less than 24 hours after the sample is obtained.
1000282]     In another embodiment the DETERMINANT is TRAIL and the array contains antibodies that
bind TRAIL. In another embodiment the DETERMINANTS are TRAIL and CRP and the array contains
antibodies that bind TRAIL and CRP. In another embodiment the DETERMINANTS are TRAIL, CRP
and VEGFR2 and the array contains antibodies that bind TRAIL, CRP and VEGFR2. In another
embodiment the DETERMINANTS are TRAIL, CRP and Mac2-BP and the array contains antibodies that
bind TRAIL, CRP and Mac2-BP. In another embodiment the DETERMINANTS are TRAIL, CRP,
VEGFR2 and Mac2-BP and the array contains antibodies that bind TRAIL, CRP, VEGFR2 and Mac2
BP. In another embodiment the DETERMINANTS are TRAIL, CRP and SAA and the array contains
antibodies that bind TRAIL, CRP and SAA. In another embodiment the DETERMINANTS are TRAIL,
CRP, SAA and Mac2-BP and the array contains antibodies that bind TRAIL, CRP, SAA and Mac2-BP.
In another embodiment the DETERMINANTS are TRAIL, CRP, SAA and ILIRA and the array contains
antibodies that bind TRAIL, CRP, SAA and ILIRA. The levels of DETERMIANT in different types of
infections are depicted in Figure 21-22. Our findings that TRAIL concentrations in viral infected patients
are higher than bacterial infected patients (median of 121  132 pg/ml versus 52  65 pg/ml), support the
embodiments wherein TRAIL concentrations are measured. Furthermore, when we monitored TRAIL
concentrations over time in patients infected with a virus, we found a substantial increase in
concentrations shortly after the infection, followed by a gradual decrease and returning to basal levels (for
example see Figure 41). More examples of TRAIL concentrations in different infections are presented in
Figure 35-39. Interestingly, we find that combining TRAIL levels, which are higher in viral compared to
bacterial infections, and CRP levels, which are higher in bacterial compared to viral infections, enables a
diagnostic accuracy that is superior to any of the individual biomarkers. For example, we found that
combining the levels of CRP and TRAIL by computing a pre-determined mathematical formula produces
a score that diagnoses the source of infection more accurately then each of the biomarkers individually
(TRAIL AUC = 0.89, CRP AUC = 0.89, TRAIL and CRP combined AUC = 0.94) . For example see
Figure 23-24 visualizes a linear formula that is used to incorporate the levels of TRAIL and CRP into a
                                                      59

single score. Other formulas exist, which are known to someone skilled in the art. The TRAIL and CRP
diagnostic synergism, may be attributed to the low correlation between these two biomarkers. We
observe similar results when combining the concentrations of SAA and TRAIL (for example see Figure
23-24).
10002831
1000284]
1000285]     We compared the genomic sequence of TRAIL across different organisms using the UCSC
genome browser (Human Feb. 2009 (GRCh37/hgl9) assembly, and found that it is evolutionary
conserved (especially in the exon regions) (see Figure 42). For example, we find sequence conservation
in large and small mammals such as cow, horse, dog and cat. This suggests that TRAIL may have a
similar protein behavior across different organisms similar to what we found in human (including up
regulation in viral infections).
1000286]     Of note, TRAIL is highly expressed in other tissues and samples including without limitation
CSF, saliva and epithelial cells, bone marrow aspiration, urine, stool, alveolar lavage, sputum, saliva
(Secchiero, Lamberti et al. 2009). Thus, some embodiments of the present invention can be used to
measure TRAIL in such tissues and samples, wherein an increase of TRAIL concentrations indicate
increased likelihood of a viral infection.
1000287]     Some aspects of the present invention can also be used to screen patient or subject
populations in any number of settings. For example, a health maintenance organization, public
health entity or school health program can screen a group of subjects to identify those requiring
interventions, as described above, or for the collection of epidemiological data. Insurance
companies (e.g., health, life or disability) may screen applicants in the process of determining
coverage or pricing, or existing clients for possible intervention. Data collected in such
population screens, particularly when tied to any clinical progression to conditions like infection,
will be of value in the operations of, for example, health maintenance organizations, public
health programs and insurance companies. Such data arrays or collections can be stored in
machine-readable media and used in any number of health-related data management systems to
provide improved healthcare services, cost effective healthcare, improved insurance operation,
etc. See, for example, U.S. Patent Application No. 2002/0038227; U.S. Patent Application No.
US 2004/0122296; U.S. Patent Application No. US 2004/ 0122297; and U.S. Patent No.

one or more data storage sites as further detailed herein.
1000288]    A machine-readable storage medium can comprise a data storage material encoded
with machine readable data or data arrays which, when using a machine programmed with
instructions for using said data, is capable of use for a variety of purposes. Measurements of
effective amounts of the biomarkers of the invention and/or the resulting evaluation of risk from
those biomarkers can be implemented in computer programs executing on programmable
computers, comprising, inter alia, a processor, a data storage system (including volatile and non
volatile memory and/or storage elements), at least one input device, and at least one output
device. Program code can be applied to input data to perform the functions described above and
generate output information. The output information can be applied to one or more output
devices, according to methods known in the art. The computer may be, for example, a personal
computer, microcomputer, or workstation of conventional design.
1000289]    Each program can be implemented in a high level procedural or object oriented
programming language to communicate with a computer system. However, the programs can be
implemented in assembly or machine language, if desired. The language can be a compiled or

1000290]    The DETERMINANTS of the present invention, in some embodiments thereof, can
be used to generate a "reference DETERMINANT profile" of those subjects who do not have an
infection. The DETERMINANTS disclosed herein can also be used to generate a "subject
DETERMINANT profile" taken from subjects who have an infection. The subject
DETERMINANT profiles can be compared to a reference DETERMINANT profile to diagnose
or identify subjects with an infection. The subject DETERMINANT profile of different
                                                  61

infection types can be compared to diagnose or identify the type of infection. The reference and
subject DETERMINANT profiles of the present invention, in some embodiments thereof, can be
contained in a machine-readable medium, such as but not limited to, analog tapes like those
readable by a VCR, CD-ROM, DVD-ROM, USB flash media, among others. Such machine
readable media can also contain additional test results, such as, without limitation, measurements
of clinical parameters and traditional laboratory risk factors. Alternatively or additionally, the
machine-readable media can also comprise subject information such as medical history and any
relevant family history. The machine-readable media can also contain information relating to
other disease-risk algorithms and computed indices such as those described herein.
Performance and Accuracy Measures of the Invention
1000291] The performance and thus absolute and relative clinical usefulness of the invention
may be assessed in multiple ways as noted above. Amongst the various assessments of
performance, some aspects of the invention are intended to provide accuracy in clinical diagnosis
and prognosis. The accuracy of a diagnostic or prognostic test, assay, or method concerns the
ability of the test, assay, or method to distinguish between subjects having an infection is based
on whether the subjects have , a "significant alteration" (e.g., clinically significant and
diagnostically significant) in the levels of a DETERMINANT. By "effective amount" it is meant
that the measurement of an appropriate number of DETERMINANTS (which may be one or
more) to produce a "significant alteration" (e.g. level of expression or activity of a
DETERMINANT) that is different than the predetermined cut-off point (or threshold value) for
that DETERMINANT(S) and therefore indicates that the subject has an infection for which the
DETERMINANT(S) is a determinant. The difference in the level of DETERMINANT is
preferably statistically significant. As noted below, and without any limitation of the invention,
achieving statistical significance, and thus the preferred analytical, diagnostic, and clinical
accuracy, may require that combinations of several DETERMINANTS be used together in
panels and combined with mathematical algorithms in order to achieve a statistically significant
DETERMINANT index.
1000292]     In the categorical diagnosis of a disease state, changing the cut point or threshold
value of a test (or assay) usually changes the sensitivity and specificity, but in a qualitatively
inverse relationship. Therefore, in assessing the accuracy and usefulness of a proposed medical
                                                   62

test, assay, or method for assessing a subject's condition, one should always take both sensitivity
and specificity into account and be mindful of what the cut point is at which the sensitivity and
specificity are being reported because sensitivity and specificity may vary significantly over the
range of cut points. One way to achieve this is by using the MCC metric, which depends upon
both sensitivity and specificity. Use of statistics such as AUC, encompassing all potential cut
point values, is preferred for most categorical risk measures when using some aspects of the
invention, while for continuous risk measures, statistics of goodness-of-fit and calibration to
observed results or other gold standards, are preferred.
1000293]     By predetermined level of predictability it is meant that the method provides an
acceptable level of clinical or diagnostic accuracy. Using such statistics, an "acceptable degree
of diagnostic accuracy", is herein defined as a test or assay (such as the test used in some aspects
of the invention for determining the clinically significant presence of DETERMINANTS, which
thereby indicates the presence an infection type) in which the AUC (area under the ROC curve
for the test or assay) is at least 0.60, desirably at least 0.65, more desirably at least 0.70,
preferably at least 0.75, more preferably at least 0.80, and most preferably at least 0.85.
1000294]     By a "very high degree of diagnostic accuracy", it is meant a test or assay in which
the AUC (area under the ROC curve for the test or assay) is at least 0.75, 0.80, desirably at least
0.85, more desirably at least 0.875, preferably at least 0.90, more preferably at least 0.925, and
most preferably at least 0.95.
1000295]     Alternatively, the methods predict the presence or absence of an infection or response
to therapy with at least 75% total accuracy, more preferably 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 97%, 98%,
99% or greater total accuracy.
1000296]     Alternatively, the methods predict the presence or absence of an infection or response
to therapy with an MCC larger than 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8., 0.9 or 1.0.
1000297]     The predictive value of any test depends on the sensitivity and specificity of the test,
and on the prevalence of the condition in the population being tested. This notion, based on
Bayes' theorem, provides that the greater the likelihood that the condition being screened for is
present in an individual or in the population (pre-test probability), the greater the validity of a
positive test and the greater the likelihood that the result is a true positive. Thus, the problem
with using a test in any population where there is a low likelihood of the condition being present
                                                     63

is that a positive result has limited value (i.e., more likely to be a false positive). Similarly, in
populations at very high risk, a negative test result is more likely to be a false negative.
1000298]     As a result, ROC and AUC can be misleading as to the clinical utility of a test in low
disease prevalence tested populations (defined as those with less than 1% rate of occurrences
(incidence) per annum, or less than 10% cumulative prevalence over a specified time horizon).
1000299]     A health economic utility function is an yet another means of measuring the
performance and clinical value of a given test, consisting of weighting the potential categorical
test outcomes based on actual measures of clinical and economic value for each. Health
economic performance is closely related to accuracy, as a health economic utility function
specifically assigns an economic value for the benefits of correct classification and the costs of
misclassification of tested subjects. As a performance measure, it is not unusual to require a test
to achieve a level of performance which results in an increase in health economic value per test
(prior to testing costs) in excess of the target price of the test.
1000300]     In general, alternative methods of determining diagnostic accuracy are commonly
used for continuous measures, when a disease category has not yet been clearly defined by the
relevant medical societies and practice of medicine, where thresholds for therapeutic use are not
yet established, or where there is no existing gold standard for diagnosis of the pre-disease. For
continuous measures of risk, measures of diagnostic accuracy for a calculated index are typically
based on curve fit and calibration between the predicted continuous value and the actual
observed values (or a historical index calculated value) and utilize measures such as R squared,
Hosmer- Lemeshow P-value statistics and confidence intervals. It is not unusual for predicted
values using such algorithms to be reported including a confidence interval (usually 90% or 95%
CI) based on a historical observed cohort's predictions, as in the test for risk of future breast
cancer recurrence commercialized by Genomic Health, Inc. (Redwood City, California).
1000301]     In general, by defining the degree of diagnostic accuracy, i.e., cut points on a ROC
curve, defining an acceptable AUC value, and determining the acceptable ranges in relative
concentration of what constitutes an effective amount of the DETERMINANTS of the invention
allows for one of skill in the art to use the DETERMINANTS to identify, diagnose, or prognose
subjects with a pre-determined level of predictability and performance.
                                                    64

1000302]     Furthermore, other unlisted biomarkers will be very highly correlated with the
DETRMINANTS (for the purpose of this application, any two variables will be considered to be
"very highly correlated" when they have a Coefficient of Determination (R 2) of 0.5 or greater).
Some aspects of the present invention encompass such functional and statistical equivalents to
the aforementioned DETERMINANTS. Furthermore, the statistical utility of such additional
DETERMINANTS is substantially dependent on the cross-correlation between multiple
biomarkers and any new biomarkers will often be required to operate within a panel in order to
elaborate the meaning of the underlying biology.
1000303]     One or more of the listed DETERMINANTS can be detected in the practice of the
present invention, in some embodiments thereof. For example, two (2), three (3), four (4), five
(5), ten (10), fifteen (15), twenty (20), forty (40), or more DETERMINANTS can be detected.
1000304]     In some aspects, all DETERMINANTS listed herein can be detected. Preferred
ranges from which the number of DETERMINANTS can be detected include ranges bounded
by any minimum selected from between one and, particularly two, three, four, five, six, seven,
eight, nine ten, twenty, or forty. Particularly preferred ranges include two to five (2-5), two to
ten (2-10), two to twenty (2-20), or two to forty (2-40).
Construction of DETERMINANT Panels
1000305] Groupings of DETERMINANTS can be included in "panels", also called
"DETERMINANT-signatures", "DETERMINANT signatures", or "multi-DETERMINANT
signatures." A "panel" within the context of the present invention means a group of biomarkers
(whether they are DETERMINANTS, clinical parameters, or traditional laboratory risk factors)
that includes one or more DETERMINANTS. A panel can also comprise additional biomarkers,
e.g., clinical parameters, traditional laboratory risk factors, known to be present or associated
with infection, in combination with a selected group of the DETERMINANTS listed herein.
1000306]     As noted above, many of the individual DETERMINANTS, clinical parameters, and
traditional laboratory risk factors listed, when used alone and not as a member of a multi
biomarker panel of DETERMINANTS, have little or no clinical use in reliably distinguishing
individual normal subjects, subjects at risk for having an infection (e.g., bacterial, viral or co
infection), and thus cannot reliably be used alone in classifying any subject between those three
states. Even where there are statistically significant differences in their mean measurements in
                                                   65

each of these populations, as commonly occurs in studies which are sufficiently powered, such
biomarkers may remain limited in their applicability to an individual subject, and contribute little
to diagnostic or prognostic predictions for that subject. A common measure of statistical
significance is the p-value, which indicates the probability that an observation has arisen by
chance alone; preferably, such p-values are 0.05 or less, representing a 5% or less chance that the
observation of interest arose by chance. Such p-values depend significantly on the power of the
study performed.
1000307]     Despite this individual DETERMINANT performance, and the general performance
of formulas combining only the traditional clinical parameters and few traditional laboratory risk
factors, the present inventors have noted that certain specific combinations of two or more
DETERMINANTS can also be used as multi-biomarker panels comprising combinations of
DETERMINANTS that are known to be involved in one or more physiological or biological
pathways, and that such information can be combined and made clinically useful through the use
of various formulae, including statistical classification algorithms and others, combining and in
many cases extending the performance characteristics of the combination beyond that of the
individual DETERMINANTS. These specific combinations show an acceptable level of
diagnostic accuracy, and, when sufficient information from multiple DETERMINANTS is
combined in a trained formula, they often reliably achieve a high level of diagnostic accuracy
transportable from one population to another.
1000308]     The general concept of how two less specific or lower performing DETERMINANTS
are combined into novel and more useful combinations for the intended indications, is a key
aspect of some embodiments of the invention. Multiple biomarkers can yield better performance
than the individual components when proper mathematical and clinical algorithms are used; this
is often evident in both sensitivity and specificity, and results in a greater AUC or MCC.
Secondly, there is often novel unperceived information in the existing biomarkers, as such was
necessary in order to achieve through the new formula an improved level of sensitivity or
specificity. This hidden information may hold true even for biomarkers which are generally
regarded to have suboptimal clinical performance on their own. In fact, the suboptimal
performance in terms of high false positive rates on a single biomarker measured alone may very
well be an indicator that some important additional information is contained within the
                                                   66

biomarker results - information which would not be elucidated absent the combination with a
second biomarker and a mathematical formula.
1000309]     Several statistical and modeling algorithms known in the art can be used to both assist
in DETERMINANT selection choices and optimize the algorithms combining these choices.
Statistical tools such as factor and cross-biomarker correlation/covariance analyses allow more
rationale approaches to panel construction. Mathematical clustering and classification tree
showing the Euclidean standardized distance between the DETERMINANTS can be
advantageously used. Pathway informed seeding of such statistical classification techniques
also may be employed, as may rational approaches based on the selection of individual
DETERMINANTS based on their participation across in particular pathways or physiological
functions.
1000310]     Ultimately, formula such as statistical classification algorithms can be directly used to
both select DETERMINANTS and to generate and train the optimal formula necessary to
combine the results from multiple DETERMINANTS into a single index. Often, techniques
such as forward (from zero potential explanatory parameters) and backwards selection (from all
available potential explanatory parameters) are used, and information criteria, such as AIC or
BIC, are used to quantify the tradeoff between the performance and diagnostic accuracy of the
panel and the number of DETERMINANTS used. The position of the individual
DETERMINANT on a forward or backwards selected panel can be closely related to its
provision of incremental information content for the algorithm, so the order of contribution is
highly dependent on the other constituent DETERMINANTS in the panel.
Construction of Clinical Algorithms
1000311] Any formula may be used to combine DETERMINANT results into indices useful in
the practice of the invention. As indicated above, and without limitation, such indices may
indicate, among the various other indications, the probability, likelihood, absolute or relative
risk, time to or rate of conversion from one to another disease states, or make predictions of
future biomarker measurements of infection. This may be for a specific time period or horizon,
or for remaining lifetime risk, or simply be provided as an index relative to another reference
subject population.
                                                  67

1000312]     Although various preferred formula are described here, several other model and
formula types beyond those mentioned herein and in the definitions above are well known to one
skilled in the art. The actual model type or formula used may itself be selected from the field of
potential models based on the performance and diagnostic accuracy characteristics of its results
in a training population. The specifics of the formula itself may commonly be derived from
DETERMINANT results in the relevant training population. Amongst other uses, such formula
may be intended to map the feature space derived from one or more DETERMINANT inputs to a
set of subject classes (e.g. useful in predicting class membership of subjects as normal, having an
infection), to derive an estimation of a probability function of risk using a Bayesian approach, or
to estimate the class-conditional probabilities, then use Bayes' rule to produce the class
probability function as in the previous case.
1000313]     Preferred formulas include the broad class of statistical classification algorithms, and
in particular the use of discriminant analysis. The goal of discriminant analysis is to predict class
membership from a previously identified set of features. In the case of linear discriminant
analysis (LDA), the linear combination of features is identified that maximizes the separation
among groups by some criteria. Features can be identified for LDA using an eigengene based
approach with different thresholds (ELDA) or a stepping algorithm based on a multivariate
analysis of variance (MANOVA). Forward, backward, and stepwise algorithms can be
performed that minimize the probability of no separation based on the Hotelling-Lawley statistic.
1000314]     Eigengene-based Linear Discriminant Analysis (ELDA) is a feature selection
technique developed by Shen et al. (2006). The formula selects features (e.g. biomarkers) in a
multivariate framework using a modified eigen analysis to identify features associated with the
most important eigenvectors. "Important" is defined as those eigenvectors that explain the most
variance in the differences among samples that are trying to be classified relative to some
threshold.
1000315]     A support vector machine (SVM) is a classification formula that attempts to find a
hyperplane that separates two classes. This hyperplane contains support vectors, data points that
are exactly the margin distance away from the hyperplane. In the likely event that no separating
hyperplane exists in the current dimensions of the data, the dimensionality is expanded greatly
by projecting the data into larger dimensions by taking non-linear functions of the original
                                                   68

variables (Venables and Ripley, 2002). Although not required, filtering of features for SVM
often improves prediction. Features (e.g., biomarkers) can be identified for a support vector
machine using a non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis (KW) test to select the best univariate features.
A random forest (RF, Breiman, 2001) or recursive partitioning (RPART, Breiman et al., 1984)
can also be used separately or in combination to identify biomarker combinations that are most
important. Both KW and RF require that a number of features be selected from the total.
RPART creates a single classification tree using a subset of available biomarkers.
1000316]     Other formula may be used in order to pre-process the results of individual
DETERMINANT measurement into more valuable forms of information, prior to their
presentation to the predictive formula. Most notably, normalization of biomarker results, using
either common mathematical transformations such as logarithmic or logistic functions, as normal
or other distribution positions, in reference to a population's mean values, etc. are all well known
to those skilled in the art. Of particular interest are a set of normalizations based on clinical
DETERMINANTS such as age, time from symptoms, gender, race, or sex, where specific
formula are used solely on subjects within a class or continuously combining a clinical
DETERMINANTS as an input. In other cases, analyte-based biomarkers can be combined into
calculated variables which are subsequently presented to a formula.
1000317]     In addition to the individual parameter values of one subject potentially being
normalized, an overall predictive formula for all subjects, or any known class of subjects, may
itself be recalibrated or otherwise adjusted based on adjustment for a population's expected
prevalence and mean biomarker parameter values, according to the technique outlined in
D'Agostino et al, (2001) JAMA 286:180-187, or other similar normalization and recalibration
techniques. Such epidemiological adjustment statistics may be captured, confirmed,
improved and updated continuously through a registry of past data presented to the model, which
may be machine readable or otherwise, or occasionally through the retrospective query of stored
samples or reference to historical studies of such parameters and statistics. Additional examples
that may be the subject of formula recalibration or other adjustments include statistics used in
studies by Pepe, M.S. et al, 2004 on the limitations of odds ratios; Cook, N.R., 2007 relating to
ROC curves. Finally, the numeric result of a classifier formula itself may be transformed post
processing by its reference to an actual clinical population and study results and observed
                                                    69

  endpoints, in order to calibrate to absolute risk and provide confidence intervals for varying
  numeric results of the classifier or risk formula.
  1000318]     Some DETERMINANTS may exhibit trends that depends on the patient age (e.g. the
  population baseline may rise or fall as a function of age). One can use a 'Age dependent
  normalization or stratification' scheme to adjust for age related differences. Performing age
  dependent normalization or stratification can be used to improve the accuracy of
  DETERMINANTS for differentiating between different types of infections. For example, one
  skilled in the art can generate a function that fits the population mean levels of each
  DETERMINANT as function of age and use it to normalize the DETERMINANT of individual
  subjects levels across different ages. Another example is to stratify subjects according to their
  age and determine age specific thresholds or index values for each age group independently.
  Measurement of DETERMINANTS
           1 The actual measurement of levels or amounts of the DETERMINANTS can be
  determined at the protein or polypeptide level using any method known in the art.
For example, by measuring the levels of polypeptide encoded by the gene products described
herein, or subcellular localization or activities thereof. Such methods are well known in the art
and include, e.g., immunoassays based on antibodies to proteins, aptamers or molecular imprints.
Any biological material can be used for the detection/quantification of the protein or its activity.
Alternatively, a suitable method can be selected to determine the activity of proteins encoded by
the marker genes according to the activity of each protein analyzed.
  1000320]     The DETERMINANT proteins, polypeptides, mutations, and polymorphisms thereof
  can be detected in any suitable manner, but is typically detected by contacting a sample from the
  subject with an antibody, which binds the DETERMINANT protein, polypeptide, mutation,
  polymorphism, or post translational modification additions (e.g. carbohydrates) and then
  detecting the presence or absence of a reaction product. The antibody may be monoclonal,
  polyclonal, chimeric, or a fragment of the foregoing, as discussed in detail above, and the step of
  detecting the reaction product may be carried out with any suitable immunoassay. The sample
  from the subject is typically a biological sample as described above, and may be the same sample
  of biological sample used to conduct the method described above.
                                                      70

1000321]    Immunoassays carried out in accordance with some embodiments of the present
invention may be homogeneous assays or heterogeneous assays. In a homogeneous assay the
immunological reaction usually involves the specific antibody (e.g., anti- DETERMINANT
protein antibody), a labeled analyte, and the sample of interest. The signal arising from the label
is modified, directly or indirectly, upon the binding of the antibody to the labeled analyte. Both
the immunological reaction and detection of the extent thereof can be carried out in a
homogeneous solution. Immunochemical labels, which may be employed, include free radicals,
radioisotopes, fluorescent dyes, enzymes, bacteriophages, or coenzymes.
1000322]    In a heterogeneous assay approach, the reagents are usually the sample, the antibody,
and means for producing a detectable signal. Samples as described above may be used. The
antibody can be immobilized on a support, such as a bead (such as protein A and protein G
agarose beads), plate or slide, and contacted with the specimen suspected of containing the
antigen in a liquid phase. The support is then separated from the liquid phase and either the
support phase or the liquid phase is examined for a detectable signal employing means for
producing such signal. The signal is related to the presence of the analyte in the sample. Means
for producing a detectable signal include the use of radioactive labels, fluorescent labels, or
enzyme labels. For example, if the antigen to be detected contains a second binding site, an
antibody which binds to that site can be conjugated to a detectable group and added to the liquid
phase reaction solution before the separation step. The presence of the detectable group on the
solid support indicates the presence of the antigen in the test sample. Examples of suitable
immunoassays are oligonucleotides, immunoblotting, immunofluorescence methods,
immunoprecipitation, chemiluminescence methods, electrochemiluminescence (ECL) or
enzyme-linked immunoassays.
1000323]    Those skilled in the art will be familiar with numerous specific immunoassay formats
and variations thereof which may be useful for carrying out the method disclosed herein. See
generally E. Maggio, Enzyme-Immunoassay, (1980) (CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, Fla.); see
also U.S. Pat. No. 4,727,022 to Skold et al. titled "Methods for Modulating Ligand-Receptor
Interactions and their Application," U.S. Pat. No. 4,659,678 to Forrest et al. titled "Immunoassay

Monoclonal Antibodies," U.S. Pat. No. 4,275,149 to Litman et al., titled "Macromolecular

titled "Reagents and Method Employing Channeling," and U.S. Pat. No. 4,230,767 to Boguslaski
et al., titled "Heterogenous Specific Binding Assay Employing a Coenzyme as Label." The
DETERMINANT can also be detected with antibodies using flow cytometry. Those skilled in
the art will be familiar with flow cytometric techniques which may be useful in carrying out the
methods disclosed herein(Shapiro 2005). These include, without limitation, Cytokine Bead Array
(Becton Dickinson) and Luminex technology.
1000324]      Antibodies can be conjugated to a solid support suitable for a diagnostic assay (e.g.,
beads such as protein A or protein G agarose, microspheres, plates, slides or wells formed from
materials such as latex or polystyrene) in accordance with known techniques, such as passive
binding. Antibodies as described herein may likewise be conjugated to detectable labels or
groups such as radiolabels (e.g.,   5S,    , mI), enzyme labels (e.g., horseradish peroxidase,
alkaline phosphatase), and fluorescent labels (e.g., fluorescein, Alexa, green fluorescent protein,
rhodamine) in accordance with known techniques.
1000325]      Antibodies can also be useful for detecting post-translational modifications of
DETERMINANT proteins, polypeptides, mutations, and polymorphisms, such as tyrosine
phosphorylation, threonine phosphorylation, serine phosphorylation, glycosylation (e.g., 0
GlcNAc). Such antibodies specifically detect the phosphorylated amino acids in a protein or
proteins of interest, and can be used in immunoblotting, immunofluorescence, and ELISA assays
described herein. These antibodies are well-known to those skilled in the art, and commercially
available. Post-translational modifications can also be determined using metastable ions in
reflector matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI
TOF) (Wirth U. and Muller D. 2002).
1000326]      For DETERMINANT-proteins, polypeptides, mutations, and polymorphisms known
to have enzymatic activity, the activities can be determined in vitro using enzyme assays known
in the art. Such assays include, without limitation, kinase assays, phosphatase assays, reductase
assays, among many others. Modulation of the kinetics of enzyme activities can be determined
by measuring the rate constant Km using known algorithms, such as the Hill plot, Michaelis
Menten equation, linear regression plots such as Lineweaver-Burk analysis, and Scatchard plot.

10003271    The term "metabolite" includes any chemical or biochemical product of a metabolic
process, such as any compound produced by the processing, cleavage or consumption of a
biological molecule (e.g., a protein, nucleic acid, carbohydrate, or lipid). Metabolites can be
detected in a variety of ways known to one of skill in the art, including the refractive index
spectroscopy (RI), ultra-violet spectroscopy (UV), fluorescence analysis, radiochemical analysis,
near-infrared spectroscopy (near-IR), nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR), light
scattering analysis (LS), mass spectrometry, pyrolysis mass spectrometry, nephelometry,
dispersive Raman spectroscopy, gas chromatography combined with mass spectrometry, liquid
chromatography combined with mass spectrometry, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization
time of flight (MALDI-TOF) combined with mass spectrometry, ion spray spectroscopy
combined with mass spectrometry, capillary electrophoresis, NMR and IR detection. In this
regard, other DETERMINANT analytes can be measured using the above-mentioned detection
methods, or other methods known to the skilled artisan. For example, circulating calcium ions
(Ca  2-) can be detected in a sample using fluorescent dyes such as the poly-amino carboxylic
acid, Fluo series, Fura-2A, Rhod- 2, the ratiometric calcium indicator Indo-1, among others.
Other DETERMINANT metabolites can be similarly detected using reagents that are specifically
designed or tailored to detect such metabolites.
1000328]    Kits
1000329]    Some aspects of the invention also include a DETERMINANT-detection reagent, or
antibodies packaged together in the form of a kit. The kit may contain in separate containers an
antibody (either already bound to a solid matrix or packaged separately with reagents for binding
them to the matrix), control formulations (positive and/or negative), and/or a detectable label
such as fluorescein, green fluorescent protein, rhodamine, cyanine dyes, Alexa dyes, luciferase,
radiolabels, among others. Instructions (e.g., written, tape, VCR, CD-ROM, etc.) for carrying
out the assay may be included in the kit. The assay may for example be in the form of a
sandwich ELISA as known in the art.
1000330]    For example, DETERMINANT detection reagents can be immobilized on a solid
matrix such as a porous strip to form at least one DETERMINANT detection site. The
measurement or detection region of the porous strip may include a plurality of sites. A test strip
may also contain sites for negative and/or positive controls. Alternatively, control sites can be
                                                  73

located on a separate strip from the test strip. Optionally, the different detection sites may
contain different amounts of immobilized detection reagents, e.g., a higher amount in the first
detection site and lesser amounts in subsequent sites. Upon the addition of test sample, the
number of sites displaying a detectable signal provides a quantitative indication of the amount of
DETERMINANTS present in the sample. The detection sites may be configured in any suitably
detectable shape and are typically in the shape of a bar or dot spanning the width of a test strip.
1000331]    Suitable sources for antibodies for the detection of DETERMINANTS include
commercially available sources such as, for example, Abazyme, Abnova, AssayPro, Affinity

polypeptide DETERMINANTS described herein.
1000332]    We note that the fraction in which the polypeptide DETERMINANTS reside affects
the ease by which the assay can be performed at the clinical setting. For example, in the clinical
setting, especially the point-of-care, it is often easier to measure polypeptides that are present in
the serum or plasma fraction compared to intra-cellular polypeptides within the leukocytes
                                                    74

fraction. This is because the latter requires an additional experimental step in which leukocytes
are isolated from the whole blood sample, washed and lysed.
1000333]     We note that in some clinical settings it is more convenient to apply assays that
measure polypeptides, rather than RNA. In particular we found that RNA levels that are
differentially induced in different types of infections do not necessarily show the same behavior
on the polypeptide level. For example, the mRNAs of IF144, IF144L and IF127 have been found
to be differentially expressed in viral compared to bacterial infections. However, when we
measured and compared their polypeptide levels in bacterial versus viral infected patients we did
not observe a significant differential response (Figure 38).

Example 1: General Methods
Clinical Study Overview
1000339]     We performed a multi-center, observational, prospective clinical study whose goal
was to develop and test a DETERMINANT-signature for the purpose of rapid and accurate
diagnosis of patients with viral and bacterial diseases. We recruited a total of 655 patients of
whom 609 had a suspected infectious disease and 46 had a non-infectious disease (control
group). The study was approved by the institutional review boards (IRB) of Bnai Zion and Hillel
Yaffe Medical Centers in Israel, where patients were recruited from 2010 to 2012.
1000340]     An overview of study workflow is depicted in Figure 1. Briefly, a data-minable
electronic case report form (eCRF) was used to record the clinical investigations, medical
history, microbiological, radiological, and laboratory data of each patient (eCRF records were
designed to preserve patient anonymity). Based on the clinical syndrome, one or more of the
following samples were sent to thorough microbiological and molecular investigations: blood,
urine, stool, sputum, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and nasal swabs. A total of 44 different pathogen
strains were identified in the cohort of patients with suspected infectious diseases through the
composite application of cultures, serology, antigen assays, and multiplex-PCRs methodologies.
Diagnosis (bacterial, viral, mixed, non-infectious, and undetermined) was determined by a panel
of at least three experts (the attending physician at the hospital, two independent senior
infectious disease experts [IDEs], and a senior pediatrician if the patient was < 18 years of age),
based on a consensus or majority decision of the expert panel, and was recorded on the eCRF. In
addition, we quantified the levels of 570 different analyte biomarkers (e.g., proteins and
metabolites) in blood drawn from these patients (some of the proteins were only measured in a
subset of the patients due to sample volume constraints). We constructed a database that included
all the eCRF-contained data for each patient (i.e., hundreds of numerical and categorical features
as well as the biomarker biochemical measurements). This database was then used to develop
and test the DETERMINANT-signatures.
                                                  77

Inclusion criteria
1000341]     Patients who were at least one month old and were willing (either the subject or legal
guardian) to sign an informed consent were eligible for inclusion. For the infectious and non-infectious
disease groups, additional inclusion criteria had to be met. These included:

The enrollment process
1000343]     After signing an informed consent, each patient underwent the following procedures:
   " Physical examination and recording of baseline variables including:
       - Demographics: gender, age, date of birth, date of recruitment, site of recruitment, etc.
       - Medical history: main complaints, background diseases, chronically-administrated
          drugs, time of symptom onset, maximal fever, etc.
       - Physical examination: directed physical examination, pulse, auscultation, throat exam,
          skin rash, lymphadenopathy screening, etc.
       - Disease-specific variables (e.g., chest X-ray for suspected lower respiratory tract
          infections [LRTI], flank tenderness for suspected urinary tract infection [UTI])
       - Complete blood count (CBC) investigation including: whole blood count, absolute
          neutrophil count (ANC), % neutrophils, % lymphocytes, etc.
   " Chemistry lab: Creatinine, urea, liver enzymes, etc.
   " Sampling of the upper respiratory tract with a nasal swab for further microbiological
       investigation
   " Sample collection based on clinical symptoms (e.g., urine culture in a patient with a
       suspected UTI, stool sampling in a patient with a suspected gastroenteritis)
   " Blood sampling for analyte biomarker measurements in MeMed labs: 2-6 ml of peripheral
       venous blood was collected in EDTA containing CBC tubes. The blood was then stored in 40
       degrees for 1-4 hours.
                                                    79

Thirty days after enrollment, disease course and response to treatment were recorded on the
eCRF as well as details such as clinical, radiological, laboratory, and microbiological results that
were unavailable at the day of enrollment.
Microbiological and molecular tests
To enable the expert panel to establish a final diagnosis with high confidence level, we
performed a thorough microbiological and molecular investigation by testing for most of the
disease-causing agents in the Western world. In this section, we present an overview of the
microbiological and molecular investigations.
For each patient, we applied two state-of-the-art CE-in vitro diagnostics (IVD)-marked multiplex
PCR assays on the specimens obtained from the nasopharyngeal swab:
   " The Seeplex@ RV15 ACE (SeeGene Ltd, Seoul, Korea). This assay is designed to detect
       the majority of known respiratory viruses (15 virus subgroups including, parainfluenza
       virus 1, 2, 3, and 4, coronavirus 229E/NL63, adenovirus A/B/C/D/E, bocavirus 1/2/3/4,
       influenza virus A and B, metapneumovirus, coronavirus OC43, rhinovirus A/B/C ,
       respiratory syncytial virus A and B, and Enterovirus)
   " Seeplex@ PneumoBacter ACE (SeeGene Ltd, Seoul, Korea). This assay is designed to
       detect six pneumonia-causing bacteria simultaneously (Streptococcus pneumoniae [SP],
       Haemophilus influenza [HI], Chlamydophila pneumonia[CP], Legionella
       pneumophila[LP], Bordetella pertussis[BP], and Mycoplasma pneumonia [MP])
Patients were tested for additional pathogens according to their suspected clinical syndrome (for
details see Clinical Study Protocol). For example:
   * Stool samples from patients with gastroenteritis were analyzed using a multiplex PCR
       assay designed to detect 10 pathogens (Rotavirus, Astrovirus, Enteric adenovirus,
      Norovirus GI, Norovirus GII, Vibrio spp., Shigella spp., Campylobacter spp., Clostridium
       Difficile Toxin B, and Salmonella spp.)
                                                 80

   " Serological testing for cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein bar virus (EBV), MP, and
       Coxiella Burnetii (Q-Fever) was performed in all the clinically relevant subgroups
   " Blood, urine, and stool cultures were performed in clinically relevant subgroups
Overall, our process detected a pathogen in >50% of the patients with an infectious disease. We
also used these results to examine the yield and accuracy of different diagnostic methods and to
evaluate the rates of false discovery among patients with a non-infectious disease.
Creating the reference standard
1000344]    Currently, no single reference standard exists for determining bacterial and viral
infections in a wide range of clinical syndromes. Therefore, we followed the Standards for
Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy (STARD) recommendation (Bossuyt et al. 2003) and created
a highly rigorous composite reference standard for testing the DETERMINANT signatures. The
composite reference standard was created in two steps. First, for each patient we performed a
thorough investigation. This included the collection of traditional types of diagnostic information
such as recording of medical history, clinical symptoms, disease course, and lab measurements,
as well as more advanced diagnostic information including microbiological, serological, and
molecular investigations (as described above). Then, we gave all the accumulated raw
information to a panel of at least three experts (for adult patients [>18 years of age], the experts
included the attending physician at the hospital and two independent senior IDEs; for children
[<I 8 years of age], the panel included a senior pediatrician as a fourth member of the expert
panel). Based on the information, each member of the expert panel assigned one of the following
diagnostic labels to each of the patients: (i) bacterial; (ii) viral; (iii) mixed (i.e., bacterial and
viral co-infection); (iv) non-infectious; or (v) undetermined. Importantly, the experts were
blinded to the diagnostic labels of theirpeers on the expert panel. The diagnosis was then
determined by majority of the expert panel. In our study, after applying the aforementioned
process to the enrolled patients (n = 575), the cohort included 242 patients (42%) with a viral
infection, 208 patients (36%) with a bacterial infection, 34 patients (6%) with a mixed infection,
46 patients (8%) with a non-infectious disease, and 45 patients (8%) with an undetermined
diagnosis (either because no majority was reached by the expert panel [6% of all patients] or
                                                   81

because the panel assigned the patient an 'undetermined' diagnosis [2% of all patients]) (Figure
2).
1000345]     The diagnostic labels assigned by our expert panel were then used to create cohorts
with an increasing level of confidence.
    " The majority cohort: Patients were included in this cohort if they were assigned a diagnosis
       of a bacterial ('bacterial patient'), viral ('viral patient'), mixed infection ('mixed patient'), or
       non-infectious disease, by a majority (>50%) of the expert panel.
    " The consensus cohort: This subset of the majority cohort included the patients for whom
       the expert panel assigned a diagnosis (bacterial, viral, mixed, or non-infectious)
       unanimously.
    " The clear diagnosis cohort: This subset of the consensus cohort included patients with a
       bacterial or viral infection that were assigned these diagnoses unanimously by the expert
       panel and who also met the following additional criteria. To be included as a bacterial
       patients, patients had to have bacteremia (with positive blood culture), bacterial meningitis
       (with positive CSF culture or >1,000 neutrophils/pL), pyelonephritis (with positive urine
       culture and an ultrasound onformation of renal involvement), UTI (with positive urine
       culture), septic shock (with positive blood culture), cellulitis, or peri-tonsillar abscess
       (proven by surgical exploration) (Thorn et al. 1977). To be included as a viral patient,
       patients had to have a positive microbiological isolate of an obligatory virus.
1000346]     Of note, in the following examples tables and figures, unless explicitly mentioned otherwise,
patient reference standards were determined based on the majority cohort. The above-mentioned
composite reference standard strategy adheres to the recommended best practice guidelines in studies of
diagnostics of infectious disease. The DETERMINAT and DETERMINANT-signature performances
reported herein were analyzed against this reference standard.
                                                       82

1000347]     Measurements of membrane bound or intra-cellular polypeptide DETERMINANT SWhole
blood was fractionated to cellular and plasma fractions and subsequantially treated with red blood cell
lysing buffer (BD Bioscience). White blood cells were subsequently washed three times with phosphate
buffered saline pH 7.3. In order to measure the levels of membrane associated DETERMINANT
polypeptides, the cells were incubated with primary antibodies for 40 minutes, washed twice and
incubated with PE conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson Laboratories, emission 575 nm) for additional
20 minutes. In case of intracellular DETERMINANT polypeptides, cells were first fixed and
permeabilized with fixation and permeabilization buffer kit (eBioscience). Following fixation and
permeabilization cells were incubated with primary antibodies for 40 minutes, washed twice and
incubated with PE conjugated secondary antibody for additional 20 minutes. IgG Isotype controls were
used for each mode of staining as negative control background. Following the staining procedure, cells
were analyzed by using an LSRII flow cytometer. Granulocytes, monocytes, platelets and lymphocytes
were distinguished from each other by using an SSC/FSC dot plot. Background and specific staining were
determined for lymphocytes, monocytes and granulocytes for each specific antigen. Total leukocytes
mean levels was computed by summing the DETERMINANT polypeptides levels of all the cell types and
dividing by the white blood count.
Polypeptide-DETERMINANTS that were measured using this protocol include:

Measurements of soluble-DETERMINANTS using ELISA
1000348]     To determine the concentrations of soluble-DETERMINANTS in human plasma samples we
used a standard Sandwich ELISA (Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay). Briefly, the wells of 96-well
plate were coated with capture-antibody specific to the soluble DETERMINANT of interest and diluted in
coating buffer (e.g. lxPBS) followed by overnight incubation at 4'C. The wells were washed twice with
washing buffer (e.g. 1xPBS with 0.2% Tween-20) and subsequently blocked with blocking buffer
                                                     83

containing proteins (e.g. 1xPBS with 0.2% Tween-20 and 5% non-fat milk) for at least 2 hours at room
temperature or overnight at 40C. This that step increases assay signal-to-noise-ratio. Wells were then
washed twice with washing buffer. Protein standard and plasma samples were diluted using a dilution
buffer (e.g. 1xPBS with 0.2% Tween-20 and 5% non-fat milk) at the adequate concentration and dilution
factors, respectively, followed by a two hour incubation at room temperature. Then, the wells were
washed three times with the washing buffer and subsequently incubated with biotinylated detection
antibody specific to the soluble DETERMINANT of interest, diluted in blocking buffer for at least two
hours at room temperature.
         The wells were washed four times with a washing buffer and then incubated with
streptavidin-HRP (i.e. horseradish peroxidase) diluted in blocking buffer for one hour at room
temperature. The wells were washed four times with the washing buffer and then incubated with
a reaction solution that contained a chromogenic HRP substrate (e.g. TMB; 3, 3', 5,5'
Tetramethylbenzidine). After adequate color development, a stop solution was added to each
well. The absorbance of the HRP reaction product was determined with an ELISA plate reader.
Soluble polypeptides that we measured using the above mentioned protocol comprise of:
B2M, CHI3L1, Mac-2BP, SAA, TRAIL, sCD62L, sTREM, ILI1, ILIRA, IP1O, I-TAC and
TNFR1.
Measurements of soluble DETERMINANTS using Luminex
1000349]     To determine the concentrations of soluble DETERMINANTS in human plasma
samples we also used the xMAP immunoassay (Luminex Corporation, Austin, Tex.) (protocol
details are available from the supplier). Briefly, the assay uses five-micron polystyrene beads
that have been impregnated with a precise ratio of two fluorescent dyes, creating up to 100
spectrally identifiable beads. The surface of these beads is coated with carboxyl terminals (an
estimated one million per bead), which serve as the attachment point for the analyte specific
antibody. Using standard immunoassay principles, a sandwich format or competition assay was
performed for each target biomarker. This included preparation of standards with predetermined
analyte concentrations, six hour incubation of the sample followed by a flow cytometer readout.
Two lasers query the beads: one for its specific ID number; the second for the intensity of the
phycoerythrin (PE) signal resulting from the immunoassay. This assay enables the simultaneous
                                                     84

measurement of a few dozen analyte specific beads to be measured simultaneously thus enabling
biomarker screening.
1000350]     More specifically, prepare standards and antibody conjugated beads and samples
within one hour of performing the assay. Reconstitute the protein standard in 0.5mL of Assay
Diluent when working with serum/plasma samples, or 50% Assay Diluent + 50% of serum
matrix for other types of samples. Avoid mixing. Determine the number of wells required for the
assay. Standard curves and samples may be run singly or in replicates, as desired. Pre-wet the 96
micro-titer plate. Pipette 0.2mL of Working wash solution into designated wells. Wait 15 to 30
seconds and aspirate the wash solution from the wells using the vacuum manifold. Immediately
before dispensing, vortex the beads for 30 seconds followed by sonication in a sonicating water
bath for 30 seconds. Pipette 25uL of the desired beads into each well. Once dispensed the beads
should be kept protected from light using an aluminum foil-wrapped plate cover. Aspirate the
liquid by gentle vacuum using the vacuum manifold. Prepare a 1x capture bead solution from the
additional lOx capture bead concentrate(s) to be multiplexed. Pipette 25uL of the additional lx
bead solution into each well. Add 0.2mL Working wash solution into the wells. Allow the beads
to soak for 15 to 30 seconds, then remove the Working wash solution from the wells by
aspiration with the vacuum manifold. Repeat this washing step. Blot the bottom of the filter plate
on clean paper towels to remove residual liquid. Pipette 50uL incubation buffer into each well.
To the wells designated for the standard curve, pipette 1OOuL of appropriate standard dilution.
To the wells designated for the sample measurement, pipette 50uL assay diluent followed by
50uL sample. Incubate the plate for 2 hours at room temperature on an orbital shaker. Shaking
should be sufficient to keep beads suspended during the incubation (500-600rpm). Ten to fifteen
minutes prior to the end of this incubation, prepare the biotinylated detector antibody. After the 2
hour capture bead incubation, remove the liquid from the wells by aspiration with the vacuum
manifold. Add 0.2mL Working wash solution to the wells. Allow the beads to soak for 15 to 20
seconds, then aspirate with the vacuum manifold. Repeat this washing step. Blot the bottom of
the filter plate on clean paper towels to remove residual liquid. Add 1OOuL of prepared lx
Biotinylated Detector Antibody to each well and incubate the plate for 1 hour at room
temperature on an orbital shaker. Shaking should be sufficient to keep beads suspended during
incubation (500-600rpm). Ten to fifteen minutes prior to the end of the detector incubation step,
                                                 85

prepare the Streptavidin-RPE. Remove the liquid from the wells by aspiration with the vacuum
manifold. Add 0.2mL Working wash solution to the wells. Allow the beads to soak for 15 to 30
seconds, then aspirate with the vacuum manifold. Repeat this washing step. Blot the bottom of
the filter plate with clean paper towels to remove residual liquid. Add 1OOuL of the prepared 1x
Streptavidin-RPE to each well and incubate the plate for 30 minutes at room temperature on an
orbital shaker. Shaking should be sufficient to keep beads suspended during incubation (500
600rpm). Prepare the Luminex instrument during this incubation step. Remove the liquid from
the wells by aspiration with the vacuum manifold. Note that a minimal pressure of 5 inches Hg is
required. Wash the beads by adding 0.2mL working wash solution to the wells, allow the beads
to soak for 10 seconds, then aspirate with the vacuum manifold. Repeat this washing step two
additional times for a total of 3 washes. Add 1OOuL working wash solution to each well. Shake
the plate on an orbital shaker (500-600rpm) for 2-3 minutes to re-suspend the beads. Uncover the
plate; insert plate into the XY platform of the Luminex instrument and analyze the samples.
Determine the concentration of the samples from the standard curve using curve fitting software.
The four parameter algorithm usually provides the best fit. If the plates cannot be read on the day
of the assay, they may be covered and stored in a dark location overnight at 2-8'C for reading the
following day without significant loss of fluorescent intensity. Aspirate working wash solution
from stored plated and add 1OOuL fresh working wash solution. Place the plates on an orbital
shaker for 2-3 minutes prior to analysis. Soluble polypeptides that we measured using the above
mentioned protocol comprise of: BCA-1, TRAIL, Eotaxin, ILla, IP10, MCP and VEGFR2.
Measurements of CRP soluble DETERMINANT
1000351]     CRP concentrations were measured using automated immunoassay machines in the
chemical laboratories of the hospitals in which the patients were enrolled.
DETERMINANT normalization
1000352]     To avoid numerical biases, some multi parametric models (such as SVMs) require
that the numerical DETERMINANTS used in the model be similarly scaled. Thus, when
performing multi-parametric analysis, we used the following linear normalization: the
DETERMINANT levels of each patient were divided by the DETERMINANT mean levels
                                                 86

computed over all the population in the study. To avoid numerical errors due to outliers (> mean
+ 3 x std), such measurements were truncated and assigned the value mean + 3 x std.
Handling of missing values/censoring/discontinuations
1000353]     Missing DETERMINANT values might arise due to technical issues in the
measurement process (e.g. deterioration of an antibody used to measure a specific
DETERMINANT). Furthermore, some of the DETERMINANTS, especially the polypeptide
DETERMINANTS, could only be measured on a subset of the patients, because the amount
clinical sample drawn from any given patient was insufficient in order to measure the entire
panel of DETERMINANTS. Consequentially, some subjects may have missing values for some
of their DETERMINANT measurements. To address this, the accuracy of each
DETERMINANT or multi-DETERMINANT signature is computed only on the patients that do
not have any missing value in the respective signature.
DETERMINANT diagnosis statistical analysis
1000354]     The classification accuracy and statistical significant of individual DETERMINANTS
was measured in terms of sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, MCC, AUC and Wilcoxon rank
sum P-value or t-test P-value. The diagnostic accuracy of the multi- DETERMINANT
signatures was determined using a leave- 100%-out cross-validation scheme for training and
testing a support vector machine (SVM) with a linear (CJC Burges, 1998). Classification
accuracy was measured using the same criteria as in the single DETERMINANT. We also tested
the classification accuracy using other multi-parametric models including: (i) an RBF kernel
SVM, (ii) an artificial neural network (one hidden layer with three nodes, one output node and
tansig transfer functions), (iii) a naive bayes network and (iv) a k-nearest-neighbor classification
algorithm. For most of the tested DETERMINANT combinations the linear SVM yielded
roughly the same classification results in terms of AUC and MCC compared the other models.
We therefore report herein only the results of the linear SVM.
                                                   87

Example 2: To facilitate a diagnostic solution that is broadly applicable we performed a clinical
study on a highly heterogeneous cohort of patients
Summary of the patient cohorts used in this study
1000355]    A total of 655 patients were recruited for this study and 575 patients were eligible for
enrollment. Based on the reference standard process described above, patients were assigned to
five different diagnosis groups: viral infection (42% of patients), bacterial infection (36% of
patients), mixed infection (6% of patients), non-infectious disease (8% of patients), and
undetermined (8% of patients) (Figure 2). In total, 92% of all enrolled patients were assigned a
diagnosis, a rate which approaches the literature-documented limit (Clements et al. 2000;
Johnstone et al. 2008; Hatipoglu et al. 2011).
1000356]    The development and testing of the DETERMINANT signature technology was
performed in a series of patient cohorts with increased confidence levels, as described above
(Creating the reference standard). Of the 575 enrolled patients, 530 had a diagnosis (bacterial,
viral, mixed, or non-infectious) assigned by the majority of the expert panel. Of these 530
patients, 376 had these diagnoses assigned unanimously (i.e., a 'consensus' diagnosis). Of the 376
patients, 170 patients had a clear diagnosis determined as described above.
The various cohorts and the number of bacterial, viral, mixed, and non-infectious patients within
each cohort are depicted in Figure 3.
Age and gender distribution
1000357]    Patients of all ages were recruited to the study. The study population (n = 575)
included more pediatric (<I 8 years) than adult (>18 years) patients (60% vs 40%). The age
distribution was relatively uniform for patients aged 20-80 years and peaked at <4 years of age
for pediatric patients (Figure 4). The observed age distribution for pediatric patients is consistent
with that expected and represents the background distribution in the inpatient setting (Craig et al.
2010) (e.g., the emergency department [ED], pediatrics departments, and internal departments).
Patients of both genders were recruited to the study. The patient population was balanced in
respect to gender distribution (49% females, 510%males).
                                                  88

Isolated pathogens
1000358]       We used a wide panel of microbiological tools in order to maximize pathogen isolation rate.
At least one pathogen was isolated in 53% of patients with an acute infectious disease (49% of all 575
enrolled patients). A total of 33 different pathogens were actively detected using multiplex PCR, antigen
detection, and serological investigation. Additional 11 pathogens were isolated using standard culture
techniques or in-house PCR. Altogether, 44 different pathogens from all major pathogenic subgroups
were isolated (Figure 5A). This rate of pathogen identification is similar to that reported in previously
published studies (Cill6niz et al. 2011; Restrepo et al. 2008; Song et al. 2008; Johansson et al. 2010;
Shibli et al. 2010) and included pathogens from all major pathogenic subgroups (Gram-negative bacteria,
Gram-positive bacteria, atypical bacteria, RNA viruses, and DNA viruses). In nearly 20% of the
patients, pathogens from >1 of the aforementioned pathogenic subgroups were detected (Figure 5A).
1000359]       The pathogenic strains found in this study are responsible for the vast majority of acute
infectious diseases in the Western world and included key pathogens such as Influenza A/B, respiratory
syncytial virus (RSV), Parainfluenza, E. Coli, Group A Streptococcus, etc. Notably, analysis of the
isolated pathogens revealed that none of the pathogens is dominant (Figure 5B). The absence of influenza
A or RSV dominance is attributed to two reasons: year-round sampling (i.e., sampling was not limited to
the winter season) and the non-occurrence of influenza and RSV epidemics in Israel during the study
timeframe (2010-2012).
Involved physiologic systems and clinical syndromes
1000360]       The infectious disease patients (all patients with a final diagnosis excluding those with non
infectious diseases, n = 484) presented with infections in a variety of physiologic systems (Figure 6). The
most frequently involved physiologic system was the respiratory system (45%), followed by systemic
infections (18%). All infections that did not involve the aforementioned systems and were not
gastrointestinal, urinary, cardiovascular, or central nervous system (CNS) infections were categorized as
'Other' (e.g., cellulitis, abscess). The observed distribution of physiologic system involvement represents
the natural distribution and is consistent with that reported for large cohorts of patients sampled year
round (CDC.gov 2012).
The patients in our study (all enrolled patients, n = 575) presented with a variety of clinical syndromes
                                                         89

(Figure 7) that reflects the expected clinical heterogeneity in a cohort of pediatric and adult patients
collected year-round. The most frequent clinical syndrome was LRTI (25%) including mainly pneumonia,
bronchitis, bronchiolitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation, and non-specific
LRTI. The second most frequent clinical syndrome was URTI (20%) including mainly acute tonsillitis,
acute pharyngitis, non-specific URTI, acute sinusitis, and acute otitis media. The third most frequent
syndrome was systemic infection (17%) including mainly fever without a source and occult bacteremia
cases. Systemic infections were primarily detected in children <3 years of age but were also detected in a
few adult patients. Systemic infections constitute a real clinical challenge as balancing between patient
risk and the costs of testing/treatment is unclear. The next most frequent syndromes were gastroenteritis
(11%), UTI (8%), and cellulitis (4%). CNS infections (2%) included septic and aseptic meningitis. All
other clinical syndromes (3%) were classified as 'Other' and included less common infections (e.g.,
peritonsillar abscess, otitis externa, epididymitis, etc.). The observed pattern of clinical syndrome
distribution represents most of the frequent and clinically relevant syndromes and is consistent with
previously published large studies (Craig et al. 2010).
Core body temperature
1000361]      Core body temperature is an important parameter in evaluating infectious disease severity.
We examined the distribution of maximal body temperatures in all enrolled patients (n = 575) using the
highest measured body temperature (per-os or per-rectum). The distribution of the maximal body
temperatures was relatively uniform between 38'C and 40'C with a peak of at 39'C (Figure 8). Body
temperature <37.5'C was reported for 8% of patients (the subgroup of patients with non-infectious
diseases). Body temperature >40.5'C was rare (<3% of patients). Altogether, the observed distribution
represents the normal range of temperatures in the clinical setting (Craig et al. 2010).
Time from symptoms onset
1000362]      'Time from symptoms' was defined as the duration (days) from the appearance of thefirst
presenting symptom (the first presenting symptom could be fever but could also be another symptom such
as nausea or headache preceding the fever). The distribution of 'time from symptoms' in our cohort (all
enrolled patients, n = 575) peaked at 2-4 days after the initiation of symptoms (40% of patients) with
substantial proportions of patients turning to medical assistance either sooner or later (Figure 9). The
observed distribution of time from initiation of symptoms represents a typical pattern in the clinical
setting.
                                                        90

Comorbidities and chronic drug regimens
1000363]     Comorbidities and chronic drug regimens may, theoretically, affect a diagnostic test. Our
patient population (all enrolled patients, n = 575) included patients (70%) that had no comorbidities and
were not treated with chronic medications and patients (30%) that had >1 chronic disease and were
treated with chronic medications. The most frequent chronic diseases in our patient population were
hypertension, lipid abnormalities, lung diseases (e.g., COPD, asthma, etc.) diabetes mellitus (mostly type
2), and ischemic heart disease, mirroring the most common chronic diseases in the Western world
(Figure 10A). All patients with chronic diseases were chronically treated with medications. The
distribution of chronic drugs used by our patient population strongly correlated with the range of reported
chronic diseases (e.g., 42% of the patients with comorbidities had lipid abnormalities and lipid lowering
agents were the most frequently used drugs). Other frequently used drugs included aspirin, blood glucose
control drugs, and beta blockers (Figure 10B).
Patient recruitment sites
1000364]     The recruitment sites in our study included ED (pediatric, adults) and other hospital
departments (pediatric, adults). The pediatric ED was the most common recruitment site (43%) and the
other sites were comparable (17-22%) reflecting a relatively balanced recruitment process. The ratio
between ED patients and hospitalized patients was ~1:1 for adults and ~2:1 for children (Figure 11).
Comparing baseline characteristics of the bacterial and viral groups
1000365]     We compared baseline characteristics of the bacterial and viral groups by age (children vs
adults; Table 4). In both children and adults, lab parameters such as WBC levels, neutrophils (%),
lymphocytes (%) and ANC, differed significantly (P <0.001) between bacterial and viral patients, in
accordance with the well-established differences between these two infection types (Christensen, Bradley,
and Rothstein 1981; Peltola, Mertsola, and Ruuskanen 2006). In children, significant differences were
also observed for age (P <0.001) and maximal body temperature (P <0.007). These findings are
consistent with the increased prevalence of viral infections in younger children and with the higher
temperature often present in bacterial vs. viral infections (Pickering and DuPont 1986). The other
variables (e.g., respiratory rate, urea, and heart rate) did not demonstrate a statistically significant
difference between the bacterial and viral groups indicating a similar clinical appearance in both groups.
Characteristics of excluded patients
1000366]     Of the 655 patients recruited for the study, 80 patients (12%) were excluded. The most
frequent reason for exclusion was having a fever below the study threshold of 37.5'C (n = 40; 50% of all
                                                         91

excluded patients), followed by time from symptom initiation of >10 days (n = 15, 19% of all excluded
patients) and having a recent (in the preceding 14 days) infectious disease (n = 13, 16% of all excluded
patients). Other reasons for exclusion included having a malignancy (hematological [9% of all excluded
patients], solid [5% of all excluded patients]) and being immunocompromised (e.g., due to treatment with
an immunosuppressive drug; 1% of all excluded patients).
Example 3: Measurements of DETERMINANT levels were highly reproducible across day-to
day technical repeats and different measurement platforms
Assay performance and QA
1000367]      Calibration curves were linear within the physiological concentration range
Standard preparations provided by the assay manufacturer served as a reference standard for the
calibration curves. Representative samples of calibration curves for TRAIL, Mac-2BP and SAA
are presented in Figure 12. We found that all the optimal cutoff values between bacterial and
viral infections were in the linear range of the scale and that all standard curves exhibited a
dynamic range of ~2-2.5 log scale.
Intra-assay variability
1000368]     We tested the intra-assay variability on eight independent serum samples of patients within
the same ELISA plate (Figure 13). We found intra-assay CV% of 4.4%, 7.5% and 4.4% for TRAIL,
Mac-2-BP, and SAA respectively. These values are within the range of normal intra-assay variation
compared with other manual ELISA assays. Using automated devices or improving assay format may
lower the intra-assay variability and increase biomarker accuracy.
Inter-assay variability
1000369]     We tested the inter-assay variability for TRAIL, Mac-2BP, and SAA in 20, 8 and 8
independent samples, respectively. We observed variations of 6.6%, 8 .1 %, and 12 .3 %, respectively
(Figure 14).
Analyte levels were similar in serum and plasma
1000370]     We tested the levels of TRAIL, Mac-2-BP, and SAA in a cohort of paired serum and plasma
samples of 32, 35 and 46 individuals, respectively. For all three analytes we observed a strong correlation
                                                       92

(r2 between 0.88 and 0.98) and comparable concentrations (slopes between 0.92 and 1.05) between
plasma and serum concentrations (Figure 15).
Analytes are stable under conditions typical for the clinical setting
1000371]     The utility of a biomarker depends on its stability in real-life clinical settings (e.g., its decay
rate when the sample is stored at room temperature prior to analyte measurement). To address this, we
examined the stability of TRAIL, Mac-2-BP, and SAA in serum samples from four, three, and five
independent individuals during 21 hours at 4'C (refrigeration) and 25'C (room temperature). Aliquots of
100 piL from each plasma sample were pipetted into 0.2 mL tubes and kept at 4'C or 25'C from 0 to 21
hours. Subsequently, we measured the levels of the analytes (different time-points of the same analytes
were measured using the same plate and reagents). The mean levels of all three analytes were roughly
stable over the first 21 hours at 4'C. The analyte half-lives at 25'C were 24  5, >48, and >48 hours for
TRAIL, Mac-2-BP, and SAA, respectively (Figure 16). These half-lives are comparable to those
observed for other biomarkers used in the clinical emergency setting (Rehak and Chiang 1988; Boyanton
and Blick 2002; Guder et al. 2007). Of note, in the real clinical setting, if the samples are stored at room
temperature, the concentrations of TRAIL should be measured within about 24 after the sample is
obtained. Alternatively, the sample should be stored at lower than 12'C, and then TRAIL can be
measured more than 24 after obtaining the sample.
Measurements are reproducible across different platforms
1000372]     The levels of TRAIL in 80 independent samples were tested using two different platforms
(ELISA and Luminex) and the results were correlated and comparable (r 2        = 0.89, P <10-5; Figure 17).
Importantly, the ELISA and Luminex assays differ in some basic aspects. For example, the Luminex
assay is based on direct fluorescence detection, whereas ELISA is based on colorimetric detection.
Furthermore, the set of capture and detection antibodies were different between the assays. Despite these
and other differences, the results were comparable demonstrating adoptability of the DETERMINANT
signature approach to other platforms.
Example 4: Most polypeptide-DETERMINANTS, even those with an immunological role, were
not differentially expressed in patients with different types of infections
                                                      93

1000373]      To screen for potential DETERMINANTS that might be differentially expressed in different
types of infections we performed biochemical measurements of over 500 polypeptides, in samples taken
from the patients enrolled in the clinical study. We found that most DETERMINANTS were not
differentially expressed in subjects with different types of infections. Moreover, we found that even
polypeptide-DETERMINATS that have a well-established mechanistic role in the immune defense
against infections or participate in inflammatory processes often showed poor diagnostic accuracy for
identifying the source of infection. This point is illustrated in Figure 18 and Table 1, which show
examples of polypeptide-DETERMINANTS with an established immunological or inflammatory role that
were not differentially expressed between patients with viral or bacterial infections. For example,
different types of INF-alpha (INF-a) have a well-established role in antiviral cellular processes. They are
mainly produced by leukocytes and may be potentiated by febrile temperatures. We measured the plasma
levels of INF-a in 22 bacterial and 27 viral patients and found no differential response (Wilcoxon rank
sum P = 0.8) (Figure 18). The protein INF-gamma (ING-g) is another cytokine that is critical to the
innate and adaptive immunity against viral and bacterial infections, which showed no differential
response (Wilcoxon rank sum P = 0.9). TNF-alpha (TNF-a) is a cytokine produced mainly by
activated macrophages. It is a major extrinsic mediator of apoptosis and was found to play a role
in viral infections (Gong et al. 1991). Following these observations hypothesize that TNF-a may be used
to diagnose the source of infection. We measured TNF-a levels in patients with bacterial and viral
infected patients and found poor differential response (Wilcoxon rank sum P = 0.9). Yet, another example
is CD95, a Fas ligand receptor that participates in the process of death-inducing-signaling-complex,
during apoptosis. This receptor was found to be involved in the host response to different infections
(Grassm6 et al. 2000). We find that the levels of CD95 on lymphocytes and monocytes were not
differentially expressed between bacterial and viral patients in a statistically significant manner (P = 0.1,
and P = 0.9, respectively). We also measured the levels of many other interleukins, cytokines and their
receptors, chemokines and their receptors, HLAs and other determinants that participate in the immune
response to infection and found that in most cases the levels of the determinants was not differentially
expressed between viral and bacterial infections (for more examples see Figure 18). Thus, an
immunological or inflammatory role of a polypeptide-DETERMINAT does not necessarily imply
diagnostic utility.
Example 5: In-vitro differential response to different types of infections does not necessarily
indicate a corresponding in-vivo differential response
1000374]      We examined whether biomarkers that are differentially expressed during in-vitro infections
are also likely to be accurate diagnostic markers in-vivo. We found that in many cases, an in-vitro
                                                        94

differential expression did not necessarily translate into the corresponding in-vivo differential expression.
The following section presents examples of this comparison.
1000375]      Previous in-vitro studies indicated that the mRNA and protein levels of arginase 1 (ARGI)
are up regulated in viral infections and remain low in bacterial infections. Briefly, the in-vitro transfection
of human hepatoblastoma HepG2 cells and human hepatoma Huh-7 cells with an infectious cDNA clone
of Hepatitis C virus (HCV) resulted in about threefold elevation of ARGI mRNA and protein levels (P <
0.01)(Cao et al. 2009). In contrast, ARGI mRNA expression levels of mouse macrophages, cocultured
with H. pylori SS1, were not elevated (Gobert et al. 2002).
1000376]      Taken together, these two in-vitro studies prompted us to examine whether ARGI may serve
as a reliable in-vivo diagnostic marker that is up-regulated in viral infections while maintaining basal
levels in bacterial infections. We measured the ARGI protein levels of 41 patients with bacterial
infections and compared it to the levels in 46 patients with viral infections. Measurements were
performed on the granulocytes, lymphocytes and total leukocytes. In all cases, we did not observe an
increase of ARGI levels in viral compared to bacterial infected patients (Figure 19). Specifically, ARGI
levels on granulocytes were not differentially expressed (Wilcoxon rank sum P = 0.3), whereas
lymphocytes and total leukocytes showed a slight increase in bacterial compared to viral infected patients
(Wilcoxon rank sum P = 0.09, and 0.003 respectively), an opposite behavior to the one reported in the in
vitro studies.
1000377]      Another example is interleukin-8 (IL-8), whose levels increased in cell culture medium of
human gastric SGC-7901 adenocarcinoma cells after treatment with Helicobacter pyloriSydney strain 1
lipopolysaccharide (Zhou et al. 2008). In contrast, in-vivo IL-8 serum levels of H. pylori-infected patients
were found similar to IL-8 serum levels of H. pylori-negative control group (Bayraktaroglu et al. 2004).
1000378]      Thus, differential expression in different in-vitro infections does not necessarily imply
differential expression in-vivo.
Example 6: DETERMINANTS that differentiate between different types of infections
1000379]      We measured over 570 polypeptides and found that most (over 95%) did not
differentiate between different types of infections. Diverging from this norm were unique subsets
of polypeptides that showed consistent and robust differential response across a wide range of
patient characteristics and pathogens (for details see patient characteristics section). The
following sections describe polypeptides and their combinations, which were useful for
diagnosing different sources of infection.
                                                        95

 DETERMINANTS that differentiate between bacterial versus viral infected subjects
1000380]      We identified a subset of DETERMINANTS that were differentially expressed in subjects
with bacterial versus viral infections in a statistically significant manner (Wilcoxon ranksum P < 0.001).
DETERMINANT names and classification accuracies are listed in Table 2A. The distributions and
individual subject measurements for each of the DETERMINANTS are depicted in Figure 20 (dots
corresponds to DETERMINANTS measurement in individual subjects and bars indicate group medians).
Each subplot corresponds to a different DETERMINANT. The abbreviations mono, lymp, gran, mean
and total are used to denote polypeptide-DETERMINANT measurements on monocytes, lymphocytes,
granulocytes as well as mean and total leukocytes measurements respectively. The abbreviations intra and
membrane are used to denote proteins that were measured in the intra cellular and membrane fraction
respectively.
1000381]      Additionally, we found that using non-specific mouse IgGI and IgG3 isotype controls as a
primary antibody (coupled with the appropriate fluorescent marker) consistently showed an increased
signal in the lymphocytes and monocytes of viral patients compared to bacterial patients (Table 2A). A
similar differential response was observed when measuring the signal of PE conjugated goat IgG (Table
2A). Although the differential signal was weak in terms of absolute levels, compared to the signal
obtained from specific bindings, it was statistically significant (Wilcoxon ranksum P < 0.001). This
phenomenon may be due to non-specific binding of IgG to Fc gamma receptors, or other receptors that
bind Ig like domains, whose levels may be elevated on host cells that respond to a viral infection.
DETERMINANTS that differentiate between mixed versus viral infected subjects
1000382]      Differentiating between a mixed infection (i.e. bacterial and viral co-infection) and a pure
viral infection is important for deciding the appropriate treatment. To address this we identified a set of
DETERMINANTS that were differentially expressed in subjects with mixed infections versus viral
infections in a statistically significant manner (Wilcoxon ranksum P < 0.001). DETERMINANT names
and classification accuracies are listed in Table 2B. The distributions and individual subject
measurements for each of the DETERMINANTS are depicted in Figure 21.

1000384]     We identified a set of DETERMINANTS that were differentially expressed in subjects with

and 2F.
DETERMINANTS that differentiate between subjects with an infectious versus a non
infectious disease
1000385]     We identified a set of DETERMINANTS that were differentially expressed in subjects with
an infectious disease versus subjects with a non-infections disease in a statistically significant manner
(Wilcoxon ranksum P < 0.00 1). DETERMINANT names and classification accuracy are listed in Table
2G. The distributions and individual subject measurements for some of the DETERMINANTS are
depicted in Figure 21B. Note that the diagnostic accuracy reported in Table 2G was obtained despite the
presence of non-pathogenic micro-organisms in the group of patients with a non-infectious disease (for
details see Figure 22). The presence of such non-pathogenic micro-organisms poses a major challenge to
diagnostic methods that seek to identify the pathogen directly, often leading to "false positives". This
challenge is overcome by some methods of the present invention. To further establish the results some
DETERMINANTS were measured on additional non-infectious patients (up to 83 patients) as depicted in
Table 2G.
DETERMINANTS that differentiate between subjects with an infectious disease versus
healthy subjects
1000386]     We identified a set of DETERMINANTS that were differentially expressed in subjects with
an infectious disease versus healthy subjects in a statistically significant manner (Wilcoxon ranksum P <
0.00 1). DETERMINANT names and classification accuracies are listed in Table 2H. The distributions
and individual subject measurements for some of the DETERMINANTS are depicted inFigure 21C.
Note that the diagnostic accuracy reported in Table 2H was obtained despite the presence of non
pathogenic micro-organisms in the healthy subjects (see Figure 22). The presence of such non-pathogenic
micro-organisms in healthy subjects poses a major challenge to diagnostic methods that seek to identify
the pathogen directly, often leading to "false positives". This challenge is overcome by methods of the
present invention.

DETERMINANT signatures for differentiating between bacterial versus viral infected
subj ects
1000387]       We scanned the space of DETERMINANT combinations and identified pairs and triplets of
DETERMINANTS whose combined signature (using multi-parametric models) differentiated between
subjects with bacterial versus viral infections in a way that significantly improved over the classification
accuracy of the corresponding individual DETERMINANTS. For example the diagnostic accuracy of
TRAIL, Mac-2BP and CRP are 0.86, 0.78 and 0.85 AUC respectively. The combination (TRAIL, CRP),
(Mac-2B, CRP) and (TRAIL, Mac-2BP, CRP) show increased diagnostic accuracy of 0.945, 0.939 and
0.954 AUC, respectively. Further examples of the combined classification accuracies of
DETERMINANT pairs, triplets and quadruplets are depicted in Table 3A, B, G and Figure 23.

1000388]       We identified pairs of DETERMINANTS whose combined signature differentiated between

pairs, triplets and quadruplets are depicted in Table 3C, D, G and Figure 24.
DETERMINANT signatures for differentiating between subjects with an infectious disease

1000389]       We identified pairs of DETERMINANTS whose combined signature differentiated between
subjects with an infectious verses a non-infectious disease. The combined classification accuracies of
DETERMINANT pairs and triplets are depicted in Table 3E,F.
Example 8: Performance analysis: mutli-DETERMINAT signatures accurately diagnoses
different sources of infection
DETERMINANT signatures that include measurements of CRP and TRAIL are highly
accurate for differentiating between patients with different types of infections
1000390]       We find that DETERMINANT signatures that include TRAIL and CRP generate particularly
high levels of accuracy. By way of example and not limitation, some the following sections present
results we obtained for the multi-DETERMNINANT signature that combines the measurements of serum
or plasma levels of TRAIL, CRP and Mac-2BP, termed "TCM-signature". Examples of other multi
DETERMNINANT signatures that produce accurate diagnosis include without limitation (TRAIL and
CRP), (TRAIL, CRP and Age), (TRAIL, CRP and SAA), (TRAIL, CRP, SAA and ILiRA) and (TRAIL,
CRP, SAA and IP10). By way of example, we assessed the diagnostic accuracy of TCM-signature in a
                                                      98

series of analyses using the aforementioned patient cohorts, starting with the cohort for which the
confidence of the reference standard was the greatest. The cohort used in the first analysis included
patients whose diagnosis (bacterial, viral) was clear (i.e., the 'Clear [bacterial, viral]' cohort). This cohort
included 170 patients. The cohorts used in the second and third analyses included patients who were
diagnosed as either bacterial or viral patients unanimously (the 'Consensus [bacterial, viral]' cohort; n =
343), or by majority (the 'Majority [bacterial, viral]' cohort; n = 450) of the expert panel. The fourth
analysis evaluated the ability of TCM-signature to differentiate viral from mixed infections in a cohort of
patients whose diagnosis (either viral or mixed) was assigned by the majority of our expert panel (the
'Majority [viral, mixed]' cohort; n = 276). The last analyses in this series evaluated whether the TCM
signature technology could perform an accurate diagnosis even after adding back the patients who were
initially excluded from the study but for whom a viral or bacterial diagnosis was made by the expert panel
(either unanimously or by majority). The cohorts used for these analyses included 368 patients
(unanimously diagnosed by the expert panel) and 504 patients (majority diagnosis).
Accuracy of distinguishing between bacterial vs viral infections in patients whose diagnosis
was clear
1000391]      We began by examining the accuracy of TCM-signature in bacterial and viral patients with a
clear diagnosis (the 'Clear [bacterial, viral]' cohort; for details see previous sections). Briefly, patients
were assigned a bacterial diagnosis if they were diagnosed unanimously by our expert panel and had
bacteremia (with positive blood culture), bacterial meningitis, pyelonephritis, UTI, septic shock, cellulitis,
or peritonsillar abscess. Patients were assigned a viral diagnosis if they were diagnosed unanimously by
our expert panel and had a positive microbiological test for an obligatory virus. The cohort for this
analysis included 170 patients (57 bacterial and 113 viral).
1000392]      We tested the accuracy of the TCM-signature using a leave-100%-out cross-validation scheme
and found a high diagnostic accuracy (AUC of 0.96). Details of different diagnostic measures of accuracy
and their 95% CIs are depicted in Figure 25 and Table 5.
The accuracy of the TCM-signature was also evaluated using a train set consisting of 2/3 of the patients
and an independent test set consisting of the remaining 1/3 of the patients. This evaluation yielded similar
results to those obtained using the cross validation scheme.
                                                         99

Accuracy of distinguishing between bacterial vs viral infections in patients whose diagnosis
was determined by a consensus of experts
1000393]      Next, we examined the accuracy of the TCM-signature in a cohort of 343 patients who were
unanimously diagnosed as bacterial (153 patients) or viral (190 patients) by our expert panel (the
'Consensus [bacterial, viral]' cohort). A leave-10%-out cross-validation scheme yielded a very accurate
diagnosis with an AUC of 0.97. Additional measures of diagnostic accuracy and their 95% CIs are
depicted in Figure 26 and Table 6. Assessment of the performance of the TCM-signature using a train set
(2/3 of the patients) and an independent test set (1/3 of the patients), yielded similar results.
Since the pathogen repertoire found in children and adults often differs, we stratified the patients by age
and repeated the analysis. We found that the TCM-signature performance remained stable across different
age groups (Figure 26).
Accuracy of distinguishing between bacterial vs viral infections in patients whose diagnosis
was determined by majority of the expert panel
1000394]      Next, we examined the accuracy of the TCM-signature in a cohort of patients who were
diagnosed as bacterial or viral by the majority of our expert panel (the 'Majority [bacterial, viral]' cohort).
The cohort consisted of 450 patients (208 bacterial, 242 viral). A leave-10%-out cross-validation scheme
yielded a diagnosis with an AUC of 0.95. Additional measures of diagnostic accuracy and their 95% CIs
are depicted in Figure 27 and Table 7. Assessment of the performance of the TCM-signature using a train
set (2/3 of patients) and an independent test set (1/3 of patients), yielded similar results. Age-based
stratification analysis also produced comparable results (Figure 27 and Table 7).
The slight decrease in performance in this cohort compared with the 'Consensus (bacterial, viral)' cohort
(AUC of 0.95 vs 0.97) may be partially attributed to the higher confidence in the diagnosis of patients in
the latter cohort. Thus, the accuracy measures reported for the 'Majority (bacterial, viral)' cohort probably
represents a lower bound on the true accuracy of the TCM-signature. Consequently, to generate a
conservative estimate of the TCM-signature performance, we report on the 'Majority' cohorts from here
onward, unless otherwise mentioned.

Accuracy of distinguishing between mixed co-infections vs pure viral infections
1000395]     A total of 34 patients (~6% of all patients with an infectious disease) were diagnosed by the
majority of experts in our panel as having a mixed co-infection (i.e., a bacterial infection with a viral co
infection in the background). Clinically, it is important to distinguish between mixed co-infections and
pure viral infections, as only the former should be treated with antibiotics. Correct diagnosis of mixed co
infection is challenging, because the dual response of the host to the bacterial and viral infections may
alter the immune-signature.
1000396]     We tested the ability of the TCM-signature to distinguish between mixed co-infections and
pure viral infections using a leave-10%-out cross-validation scheme in a cohort of patients whose
diagnosis was determined as viral or mixed by the majority of experts in our panel (the 'Majority [viral,
mixed]' cohort). The diagnostic accuracy in terms of AUC was 0.97, 0.93, and 0.95 in children, adults,
and all ages, respectively, demonstrating the ability of the TCM-signature to successfully distinguish
between these two infection types (Figure 28, Table 8).
                                                      101

Diagnostic accuracy remains robust when testing cohorts that include patients that were
initially excluded from the study
The TCM-signature was originally designed to diagnose patients with acute bacterial/viral
infections that adhere to a pre-defined list of inclusion/exclusion criteria.
We tested the ability of the TCM-signature to diagnose the excluded patients (e.g., patients with
fever below 37.5'C) by adding the excluded patients (for whom a diagnosis was determined
unanimously or by majority of our expert panel) to the 'Consensus (bacterial, viral)' cohort and
the 'Majority (bacterial, viral)' cohort, respectively and comparing the diagnostic accuracy before
and after the addition, using the leave- 100%-out cross-validation scheme (Table 9 and Figure 29).
The accuracy in the 'Consensus (bacterial, viral)' cohort with (n = 368) and without (n = 343) the
excluded patients remained the same (AUC of 0.97 in both cases). The accuracy in the 'Majority
(bacterial, viral)' cohort was also similar with (n = 450) and without (n = 504) the excluded
patients (AUC of 0.95 vs 0.94). Thus, the TCM-signature performance remained robust even
after adding the excluded patients to the analysis.
By excluding patients with marginal DETERMINANT-signatures the level of diagnostic
accuracy can be increased
1000397]     By excluding patients with marginal DETERMINANT-signatures (i.e. DETERMINANT
signatures that yield intermediate scores, such as scores that are neither characteristic of viral nor bacterial
behavior), one can further improve the levels of diagnostic accuracy (for example see Table 14-15 and
Figures 39-40).
Example 9. The diagnostics accuracy of DETERMINANT signatures remains robust across
different patient subgroups
1000398] We asked whether the diagnostic accuracy of the DETERMINANT signatures remains robust
across different patient subgroups and clinical settings. To this end, we stratified the patients according to
a wide range of patient characteristics including time from symptom onset, the specific clinical syndrome,
maximal temperature, pathogen subfamily, comorbidities, and treatment with drugs for chronic diseases,
and found that the diagnostic accuracy remained robust. By way of example and not limitation, the
following section that the TCM-signature diagnostic accuracy is robust across different patient subgroups.
                                                      102

We observed robust levels of accuracy in other DETERMINANT signatures including without limitation:
(TRAIL and CRP),      (TRAIL and CRP and SAA), (TRAIL and CRP and Age), _TRAIL and CRP and
SAA and Age) (TRAIL, CRP, SAA, Mac-2BP), (TRAIL and CRP and SAA and ILIRA) as well as
(TRAIL and CRP and SAA and IP-10). These results further demonstrate the diagnostics utility of some
embodiments of the present invention in the context of the real clinical setting and its inherent complexity
that stems from patient heterogeneity.
Stratification based on time from onset of symptoms
1000399]     The levels of molecules that participate in the immune response to an infection usually
exhibit a temporal behavior (e.g., different antibody isotypes such as IgM and IgG show distinct temporal
responses to infection onset). Not surprisingly, we found that many of the analytes tested in the present
study exhibited various temporal dynamics after initial appearance of symptoms. The DETERMINANT
signatures aims to maintain accuracy levels that are invariant to time from symptoms onset (up to 10
days), by considering the levels of multiple analytes with different temporal dynamics, which are used to
compensate one another.
1000400]     To examine the performance of the DETERMINANT signatures as a function of time from
onset of symptoms, we stratified all patients in the 'Majority (bacterial, viral)' cohort according to the time
from the initial appearance of symptoms (0-2, 2-4, 4-6, and 6-10 days) and tested the DETERMINANT
signatures performance in each subgroup. The accuracy remained roughly the same across the evaluated
subgroups (for example, the performance of the TCM-signature is depicted in Figure 30 and Table 10A),
indicating that the performance is generally robust in the first 10 days after symptom onset. Clinical
syndromes stratification
1000401]     We examined the accuracy of the DETERMINANT signatures in infections occurring in
different physiological systems and clinical syndromes (Table 1OB). The TCM-signature demonstrated
very high accuracy in respiratory and systemic infections (AUC of 0.95 and 0.96, respectively) and
slightly lower accuracy in gastrointestinal infections (AUC of 0.89). The TCM-signature performance
was also robust in different clinical syndromes including fever without source, community acquired
pneumonia, and acute tonsillitis (AUCs of 0.96, 0.94, and 0.94, respectively). Other panels, including
panels that measured CRP and TRAIL, showed similar robust results.
                                                      103

Maximal temperature stratification
1000402]     The accuracy of diagnostic assays may depend on disease severity. The severity of an
infectious disease could be assessed using the maximal core body temperature measured during the
infection. We examined whether the DETERMINANT signatures performance depends on patients' fever,
by stratifying the patients in the 'Majority (bacterial, viral)' cohort based on their maximal temperature
and testing the performance in each group. We found that the diagnostic accuracy in patients with high
fever (>39 C) was similar to that observed in patients with low-to-medium fever (38-39 C), (for example
AUC of the TCM-signature was 0.956 and 0.952, respectively) (Figure 31).
1000403]     Since children tend to have higher fevers than adults, we divided the cohort to children (< 18
years) and adults (>18 years) and repeated the analysis. Again, no significant difference in the
DETERMINANT signatures performance was observed for patients with high vs low-to-medium fever
(Figure 30).
Pathogen subfamily stratification
10004041     A total of 44 different pathogens strains were isolated from the patients enrolled in the current
study. We assessed the DETERMINANT signatures performance on different strains. To this end,
patients from the 'Majority (bacterial, viral, mixed)' cohort with a positive isolation were stratified
according to the isolated pathogen. Each bacterial strain was tested against all viral patients and each viral
strain was tested against all bacterial patients (for example see Table 1OC). We observe robust results
across a wide range of pathogens with a mean AUC of 0.94.
Accurately diagnoseing adenoviruses - a viral subgroup that is particularly challenging to
diagnose
10004051     Adenoviruses are a subgroup of viruses that are particularly challenging to diagnose because
they induce clinical symptoms and lab results that often mimic those induced by a bacterial infection.
Consequently, adenovirus infections are often treated as a bacterial infection (Kunze, Beier, and Groeger
2010). Furthermore, this subgroup is particularly important because of their wide prevalence in children
(5-15% of the respiratory and gastrointestinal infections in children) (Kunze, Beier, and Groeger 2010).
We tested DETERMINANT signatures accuracy in children (age <1 8 years) with any bacterial infection
vs children with viral infections and a positive isolation of an adenovirus (79 and 27 children,
respectively). The DETERMINANT signatures achieved significantly higher accuracy levels compared
with standard clinical and laboratory parameters (for example see Table 1OD).
                                                       104

Accurately diagnosing atypical bacteria
1000406]     Atypical bacterial infections often cause clinical symptoms resembling those of a viral
infection, thus posing a clinical diagnostic challenge (Principi and Esposito 2001). Patients infected with
atypical bacteria could benefit from macrolides antibiotics; yet, they are often left untreated (Marc et al.
2000). Additionally, patients with viral infections are often suspected of having atypical bacteria leading
to erroneous administration of antibiotics (Hersh et al. 2011). We tested the DETERMINANT signatures
accuracy in 23 patients that were infected with atypical bacterial (16 Mycoplasma pneumonia, 4
Chlamydia pneumonia, 2 Legionella pneumophila, and 1 Rickettsia corona) vs 242 viral patients. The
same test was performed using standard clinical and laboratory parameters. Results are summarized in
Table 10E. For example, the performance of the TCM-signature was significantly better than that of any
of the clinical and lab parameters (P <0.001 when comparing any of the clinical or lab parameter AUCs to
that the TCM-signature).
Comorbidity-based stratification
1000407]     In real-world clinical practice, patients often have background comorbidities, which could,
potentially, affect the level of analytes measured by the DETERMINANT signatures. We therefore
examined whether particular comorbidities impact the performance of the DETERMINANT signatures.
To this end, we analyzed the most prevalent comorbidities in our patient cohort: hypertension,
hyperlipidemia, obesity, asthma, atherosclerosis-related diseases (e.g., ischemic heart disease, myocardial
infarction and cerebrovascularaccident), diabetes mellitus 2, and inflammatory diseases (e.g.,
rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis, Behcet's disease, Crohn's disease, diabetes mellitus 1,
fibromyalgia, and familial Mediterranean fever [FMF]). For each of these comorbidities, we examined the
concentrations of the analytes building some of the DETERMINANT signatures and searched for
differences in analyte levels between patients with and without the comorbidity. Specifically, patients
were first divided by disease type (bacterial or mixed, viral, and non-infectious disease). For each of the
comorbidities, patients were further divided according to whether they had it (target group) or not
(backgroundgroup). Since some comorbidities are age dependent, we controlled for age differences in
the target and background groups by computing a characteristic age interval in the target group (mean 
2xSD) and excluded any patients that fell outside this interval in both the target and background groups.
Next, we tested whether the concentrations of the analytes building some of the DETERMINANT
signatures were different in the target vs the background groups using WS P-values (Table 1OF). None of
the evaluated comorbidities were associated with significant alterations in the levels of signature analytes
                                                       105

(target vs background groups), indicating that the analytes building the DETERMINANT signatures are
by and large insensitive to the evaluated comorbidities.
Stratification by chronic drug regimens
1000408]      In real-world clinical practice, patients are often under various chronic drug regimens, which
could, potentially, affect the level of analytes included in the DETERMINANT signatures. We therefore
examined whether specific drugs impact the performance of the DETERMINANT signatures by
performing the same analysis as for the comorbidities (see above). We examined the following drugs:
statins (Simvastatin, Pravastatin, Lipitor, and Crestor), diabetes-related drugs (insulin, Metformin,
Glyburide, Repaglinide, Sitagliptin, and Acarbose), beta blockers (Atenolol, Carvedilol, Metoprolol,
Normalol, Propranolol, and Bisprolol), Aspirin, antacids (Omeprazole, Ranitidine, and Famotidine),
inhaled corticosteroids (Budesonide, Salmeterol, Budesonide in combination with formoterol, and
Hydrocortisone), bronchodilators (Ipratropium, Salbutamol , and Montelukast) and diuretics (Furosemide,
Disothiazide, and Spironolactone). Table 1OG depicts the WS P-values for comparing analyte
concentrations measured in patients who were under a specific drug regimen vs those who were not. None
of the evaluated drug groups were associated with significant alterations in the levels of the
DETERMINANT signatures analytes.
Sepsis based stratification
1000409]      Sepsis is a potentially fatal medical condition characterized by a whole-body inflammatory
state (called systemic inflammatory response syndrome [SIRS]) and the presence of a known or suspected
infection (Levy et al. 2003). Patients with a bacterial sepsis benefit from early antibiotic therapy; delayed
or misdiagnosis can have serious or even fatal consequences (Bone et al. 1992; Rivers et al. 2001). We
focused on adult patients for whom the definition of SIRS is clear and examined the ability of the
DETERMINANT signatures to distinguish between adult patients with bacterial sepsis and those with
viral infections as well as between adult patients with bacterial sepsis and those with viral sepsis.
1000410]      Adult patients with bacterial sepsis were defined according to the American College of Chest
Physicians and the Society of Critical Care Medicine (Bone et al. 1992). SIRS was defined by the
presence of at least two of the following findings: (i) body temperature <36'C or >38'C, (ii) heart rate
>90 beats per minute, (iii) respiratory rate >20 breaths per minute or, on blood gas, a PaCO 2 <32 mm Hg
(4.3 kPa), and (iv) WBC <4,000 cells/mm3 or >12,000 cells/mm3 or >10% band forms. We found that the
DETERMINANT signatures achieved very high levels of accuracy in distinguishing between adult
patients with bacterial sepsis and those with viral infections (for example the TCM-signature showed an
                                                        106

AUC of 0.98 and 0.96 for the 'Consensus [adult bacterial sepsis, adult viral]' and the 'Majority [adult
bacterial sepsis, adult viral]' cohorts, respectively, Table 1OH). We observed similar results for
distinguishing between patients with bacterial sepsis and those with viral sepsis (AUC of 0.97 and 0.95
for the 'Consensus [adult bacterial sepsis, adult viral sepsis]' and the 'Majority [adult bacterial sepsis, adult
viral sepsis]' cohorts, respectively). These results demonstrate the utility of the DETERMINANT
signatures in differentiating adult patients with bacterial sepsis from adult patients with viral infections.
Example 10: The DETERMINANT signatures Performance Remains Robust Across Different
Clinical Sites and Settings
Clinical-setting based stratification
1000411]      We compared the DETERMINANT signatures performance in the following clinical settings:
Emergency setting (i.e., pediatric ED [PED] and ED) and non-emergency setting (i.e., pediatrics and
internal departments) (Table 11). Performances in the emergency and non-emergency settings were
similar (for example TCM-signature had an AUC of 0.95 vs 0.96 in the 'Consensus [bacterial, viral]'
cohort, and 0.92 vs 0.91 in the 'Majority [bacterial, vital, mixed]' cohort, respectively).
In addition, we compared the DETERMINANT signatures performance in patients enrolled in
two different hospitals and found that the performance was similar across sites (Table 12).
Example 11: determinant levels change as a function of age
1000412]      We examined the DETERMINAT levels of viral and bacterial patients as a function of age.
We found that the levels of many DETERMINANTS are age dependent. For example, the levels of viral
induced DETERMINANTS RSAD2, MX1, TRAIL and Mac-2BP show relatively high levels in young
children, followed by a gradual decrease with age. In contrast the DETERMINANT levels of CHI3L1
increases with age. Figure 32 shows examples of DETERMINANT levels in different infections as a
function of Age. This finding can be used to improve the accuracy of DETERMINANTS for
differentiating between different types of infections by performing age dependent normalization or
stratification (i.e. age dependent normalization or stratification). For example, one skilled in the art can
generate a function that fits the population mean levels of each DETERMINANT as function of age and
uses it to normalize the DETERMINANT of individual subjects levels across different ages. Another way
to improve diagnostic accuracy is to stratify subjects according to their age and determine thresholds or
index values for each age group independently. For example, when testing the DETERMINANT accuracy
only on young children (age 0 -5 years) the following DETERMINANTS improved their accuracy:
TRAIL (0.9 to 0.93 AUC), RSAD2 (0.81 to 0.83 AUC) and Mac-2BP (0.78 to 0.85 AUC).

Example 12: performance is robust to the presence of bacteria and viruses that are part of the
natural flora
1000413] Many disease-causing pathogens are also part of the natural flora, and are frequently found in
healthy individuals and in patients with non-infectious diseases (Vaneechoutte et al. 1990; Regev-Yochay
et al. 2004; Shaikh, Leonard, and Martin 2010). These non-pathogenic bacteria and viruses, termed
colonizers, pose a considerable diagnostic challenge because their presence does not necessarily imply
pathogenicity. In other words, merely isolating these bacterial/viral strains from a patient does not
necessarily indicate that they are the disease-causing agents; therefore, the appropriate treatment may
remain unclear.
1000414]      We investigated whether the DETERMINANT signatures performance is influenced by
colonization, focusing on the most prevalent bacterial strains in our patient cohort, Streptococcus
pneumoniae (SP) and Haemophilus influenzae (HI), and the viral strain Rhinovirus A/B/C. To detect
these strains, we applied multiplex-PCR to the nasopharyngeal wash of the 'Majority (bacterial, viral,
mixed, non-infectious)' cohort. First, we examined the prevalence of these strains in patients with non
infectious diseases (n = 46) (Figure 33.A). Isolation rate was higher (about 5-fold) in children (<18 years)
then in adults (>18 years), in accordance with previous studies (Regev-Yochay et al. 2012). Next, we
examined the prevalence of these strains in patients with bacterial (n = 208), viral (n = 242), and mixed (n
= 34) infections as determined by the majority of our expert panel (Figure 33.B and Table 13). The
bacterial strains SP and HI were highly prevalent in viral patients (510% and 36%, respectively) and
rhinovirus A/B/C was detected in 4% of the bacterial patients. Thus, bacterial or viral etiologies cannot be
inferred merely based on isolation of a specific strain.
1000415]      To test whether the DETERMINANT signatures performance is influenced by SP
colonization, we stratified the patients based on SP colonization and examined the accuracy of the
DETERMINANT signatures (viral vs bacterial) in each group separately. For example, we found that the
TCM-signature performed similarly in both groups (AUC of 0.95  0.03 vs 0.94  0.04 in the groups with
and without SP colonization, respectively). We used the same approach to evaluate the impact of HI and
rhinovirus A/B/C colonization and the findings were comparable (Figure 34). Thus, our findings
indicate that the DETERMINANT signatures performance is robust to the colonization of patients by SP,
HI, or rhinovirus A/B/C.
Example 13: Trail is an effective polypeptide for Diagnosing Viral Infections
                                                     108

1000416]      In a setting where resources are limited (e.g., a family physician's office), it may be
advantageous to have a rapid, easy-to-perform assay, even at the cost of a reduced diagnostic accuracy. In
this section, we explore the accuracy of TRAIL as a single polypeptide, to detect viral infections.
Although the accuracy of TRAIL is lower than that of some DETERMINANT signatures, it requires the
measurement of a single polypeptide and is thus readily measurable on a wide range of machines
including lateral flow immunoassay analyzers that are widely spread at the point-of-care setting.
We examined the diagnostic utility of TRAIL using the 'Consensus (bacterial, viral)' cohort (n             =
343, 153 bacterial and 190 viral) and found that TRAIL concentrations were substantially higher
in viral vs bacterial patients (t-test P<10-23 ) (Figure 35) and that the AUC was 0.9 (Figure 36).
1000417]      One application of the TRAIL-based assay is to rule out bacterial infections (e.g., using a
cutoff that produces a sensitivity of 97% and specificity of 55%; Figure 36). In an outpatient setting
where the ratio between bacterial and viral infections is ~1:4, this would translate to an NPV of 99% and
PPV of 35%. Thus, antibiotics can be withheld in case of a negative test result, whereas a positive test
result would require an additional workup to facilitate an informed treatment decision.
Excluding patients with marginal TRAIL calls (i.e., patients that fall near the cutoff), can further
increase the level of accuracy. The balance between the number of patients diagnosed and the
accuracy of the assay is depicted in Figure 37.
1000418]      Interestingly, when comparing TRAIL levels across different patient subgroups we found that
its concentrations were highest in viral patients (median of 121  132 pg/ml), lower in healthy and non
infectious patients (median of 88  41 pg/ml), and lowest in bacterial patients (52  65 pg/ml). These
results suggest that not only does viral infections up-regulate TRAIL levels, but also that bacterial
infections down-regulate them. The finding that bacterial infections down regulate TRAIL is further
supported by our observation that in viral and bacterial co-infections (i.e. mixed infections) TRAIL levels
are low (which may be due to bacterial response dominance). Altogether, in addition to TRAIL's up
regulation in viral infections, its down regulation in bacterial infections, contribute to its ability to
accurately distinguish between viral and bacterial infections. This point is further illustrated in Figure 41.
1000419]      Of note, TRAIL dynamics is correlated with the disease stage (Figure 41). Thus TRAIL can
be used not only for diagnosis of infection, but also for identifying disease stage and prognosis.
