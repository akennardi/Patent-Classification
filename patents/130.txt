                                    DESCRIPTION
              A  SYSTEM FOR SETTING A DELIVERY COUNT RANK
Technical Field
 [0001]
         The present invention relates to a delivery count rank
setting     system for liquid         petroleum      (LP) gas cylinders.      More
particularly, the present invention relates to a                       system for
setting      a   delivery      count rank to deliverymen            working  for a
delivery base.
Background Art
 [0002]
         The supply of LP gas is divided into importation from
industrial gas-producing countries, and domestic production
obtained as a by-product of the production process for petroleum
products.        Import terminals that       store     LPgas carried    by tankers
from industrial         gas-producing countries,           as well as petroleum
refining      bases,   are respectively       called    primary terminals.      LP
gas is    loaded onto coastal vessels           and tank trucks,      and shipped
fromprimary terminals to secondary terminals, which are transit
stations      located along the coast or inland for LP gas shipping.
Additionally, LP gas carried             to secondary terminals is         shipped
to local LP gas filling stations, filled in LP gas cylinders
at   the filling     stations,      and delivered to individual homes and
factories.
                                        - 1-

 [0003]
        A delivery area is    defined for each filling             station,     which
acts   as a delivery base.      In the past, a delivery base supervisor
divided the delivery area into fixed sub-areas, and assigned
to each sub-area a deliveryman in charge of that sub-area.
 [0004]
        A fixed number of deliverymen work for each delivery base.
As discussed above,       in  the past,        the delivery base supervisor
divided the delivery area into fixed sub-areas, and assigned
to each sub-area a deliveryman in              charge of that      sub-area.       For
example,      if deliverymen 1,      2,  3,    4,   and 5,   for a total      of five
deliverymen, work for a delivery base A, the supervisor divided
the delivery area into five sub-areas a, b, c, d, and e, and
assigned deliveryman 1 to sub-area a,                deliveryman 2 to sub-area
b,   and so on, up to deliveryman 5 assigned to sub-area e.
 [0005]
        When managing a delivery area in             this   way, a problem arises
in   which customers whose delivery is               scheduled on the same day
become clustered       in a specific        sub-area.        This occurs because
the timing for delivering          an LP gas cylinder, although decided
by predicting      the remaining gas amount for each customer,                     has
a consumption cycle that         differs        for each customer.          Also,    if
a    temporary     substitute       deliveryman           is  needed      because       a
deliveryman takes a leave,          there is      a problem of how to allocate
the sub-area handled by the deliveryman on leave.                     In this   case,
there is also the problem of reduced delivery efficiency due
to allocating      the sub-area handled by the deliveryman on leave
                                       - 2   -

to a substitute deliveryman who is unfamiliar with the area.
Furthermore, every time there is a                          change in the number of
associated           deliverymen       due      to    a   decrease       or    increase        in
deliveryman,             or   every  time      a   reevaluation         of   the    sub-area
definition         is    required because of factors               such as an increase
in new customers in a specific sub-area, the supervisor must
redefine the sub-areas and reassign deliverymen into                               the newly
defined sub-areas.
 [0006]
           In order to solve such problems, the inventor has succeeded
in providing means to conduct area management in accordance with
thedeliverycapabilityof                 adeliverymanbydividingthedelivery
area of a delivery base into                sub-areas according to "a delivery
count       rank"      expressing      the number          of   gas   cylinders         that     a
deliveryman is              able to deliver in a              single day.         With this
technology,           if    a  delivery base A           employing a        deliveryman A
 (delivery count rank 30) , B (delivery count rank 20) , C (delivery
count rank 20),           D (delivery count rank 20),            andE (delivery count
rank 10)      has 100 gas cylinders to be delivered in                       a single        day,
the      delivery         area   is  divided        into     sub-areas        so   that       the
deliverymen are assigned 30,                      20,    20,   20,   and 10      cylinders,
respectively.
 [0007]
           Patent Literature          1 discloses         a delivery vehicle driver
employee management system intended to manage delivery vehicle
driver       employees         who  are   responsible          for   shipping.           Patent
Literature 1 was devised in light of the demand for not only
                                             -   3  -

driving services and driving-related services, and various
associated            services     such   as    sales,    marketing,    and
proposal-making in transportation business, and the objective
thereof       is    to support    efficient  and appropriate assignment
decisions             by     comprehensively       grasping    both     the
capability/suitabilityof            each deliveryvehicle driver employee
as well as customer demands.
 [0008]
         With the above technology that divides the delivery area
of a delivery base into sub-areas according to delivery count
rank, an appropriate setting of delivery count rank provides
a stable supply of gas cylinders.            If a deliveryman is   assigned
a delivery count rank that is above that deliveryman' s capability,
there is an increased risk of being unable to deliver to customers
on the delivery due date.            On the other hand, if   a deliveryman
isassignedadeliverycount rank that isbelowthatdeliveryman' s
capability,          extra deliverymen who are not actually needed are
judged to be necessary, and excess costs are incurred.
 [0009]
         Also, if       a deliveryman is  assigned a delivery count rank
that is inappropriate for that deliveryman's capability, it
becomes       difficult      to appropriately    judge  the deliveryman's
capability that should be ensured for the delivery base overall.
 [0010]
         Consequently, there is demand for a system for setting
an appropriate delivery count rank expressing the delivery
capability of a deliveryman.

           Patent    Literature           1    grasps     the    capability        of   driver
employees         and     supports          appropriate        assignment         decisions,
particularlywith            the obj ective of suitable             personnel assignment
based on a performance evaluation of employees who carry out
service work demanded in association with driving work, but
differs         from    the     present          invention,       which       sets   delivery
capability        for the purpose of a stable                supply of gas cylinders.

           In order to solve the above problems, a delivery count
ranksettingsystemaccordingtothepresentinventioncomprises:
a storage device that                stores a delivery count rank for each
deliveryman, a progress flag indicating whether or not each
deliveryman is           subject to a progress check,                   and a performance
of each deliveryman in a designated period, the performance
including a total transmitted count, a total actual count, a
stipulated         number       of   attendances,          and     an actual       number      of
attendances;          and rank         setting      unit    that     calculates       a  total
undelivered task count and an undelivered task rate                              on the basis
of the       total    transmitted count and the                     total     actual count,
                                                -  5 -

number of attendances and the actual number of attendances,                              and
sets a delivery count rank for each deliveryman on the basis
of the total         undelivered task count,              the undelivered task rate,
theworkattendancerate,                andtheprogressflag.              Theranksetting
unit     specifies      a deliveryman in          a blue zone on the basis            of the
total undelivered task count, the undelivered task rate, and
the work attendance rate,                  sets the delivery count rank of a
deliveryman in the blue zone included in the storage device,
specifies a deliveryman in a yellow zone on the basis of the
undeliveredtaskrate,              anddetermines the settingof               theprogress
flag    of a deliveryman in           the yellow zone included in            the storage
device.          If the progress flag indicates that the deliveryman
is   not subject to a progress check,                     the rank setting      unit    sets
the progress flag of the deliveryman in the yellow zone to a
value indicating            that  the deliveryman is             subject to a progress
check.        If   the progress flag         indicates       that   the deliveryman is
subject to a progress check, the rank setting unit sets the
progress flag          of the deliveryman in              the yellow zone to a value
indicating that the deliveryman is not subject to a progress
check, and in addition, sets the delivery count rank of the
deliveryman in          the yellow zone included in                the storage device.
The rank setting            unit   sets    the progress flag          of a deliveryman
other than the specified deliveryman in the yellow zone to a
value indicating          that   the deliveryman is not subj ect to a progress
check, specifies a deliveryman in a red zone on the basis of
                                            -   6   -

a deliveryman in           the red zone included in             the storage device.
 [0014]
        By   appropriately           setting         the   delivery    count       rank of
deliverymen, delivery volume may be controlled according to
delivery count rank,             and gas cylinders may be supplied stably.
Additionally,          in  the management of personnel to be assigned to
a   delivery      area,      it   is   possible        to   achieve   an appropriate
personnel configuration that                   is   based on delivery count rank.
Furthermore,         by varying wages according to the delivery count
rank that     reflects       the delivery capability             of the deliverymen,
it    is possible to           pay wages        commensurate with the             delivery
capability of the deliverymen.

Description of Embodiments
 [0016]
        Hereinafter, a delivery system according to an embodiment
of the invention will     be described in           detail     and with reference
to the attached drawings.
 [0017]
        (Overview of delivery system)
        First,   an overview of an LP gas cylinder delivery system
will   be described.     FIG.   1 is     a diagram illustrating            a network
topology according to an embodiment of the present invention.
In   FIG.   1, a delivery server 101 installed                in  a head office       is
configured to communicate, via a network 102,                        with multiple
client    computers 103a,   103b,       ...   , 103n (hereinafter        called      the
client     computers   103)   installed          in  a     delivery    center       that
centrallymanages deliveries           at eachdeliverybase.              Inaddition,
the delivery server 101 is configured to communicate, via a
network 104, with multiple mobile terminals 105a, 105b,
105n    (hereinafter called the mobile terminals                     105).
 [0018]
        The delivery server 101 generates delivery data for each
deliverybasebyaggregatingdata ongas cylinders tobe delivered
from the delivery base the next day,                and data on gas cylinders
that were      scheduled to be delivered today but could not be
                                      -     9 -

delivered.         After that,     the delivery server 101 assigns the
generated       delivery     data   to each        deliveryman       working        at  the
delivery       base,     and    generates       delivery      schedule           data   per
deliveryman.
 [0019]
          In response to a delivery data request from a deliveryman' s
mobile terminal 105,          the delivery server 101 also transmits the
delivery schedule data per deliveryman corresponding to that
deliveryman via the network 104.                    Additionally, the delivery
server 101 receives delivery operation data                       (that      is,   data on
gas cylinders that were delivered today) or undelivered task
data      (that is, data on gas cylinders that were not delivered
today) by deliverymen from the mobile terminals 105,                              and uses
the received data to update a storage unit              included in the delivery
server 101.
 [0020]
          The client     computer     103 is     a terminal used by a user at
a delivery center.           The user connects to the delivery server
101 via the client computer 103                  to perform work specific to
delivery       services,       such    as   checking      delivery           status     and
transmitting         a  delivery    data     creation     instruction.              In  the
present embodiment,          the client     computer 103 is         installed        in the
delivery center,          but may also be installed            in    the head office
like    the delivery server 101,          or installed     in   the delivery base.
 [0021]
          The mobile terminal 105           is a terminal provided to each
deliveryman at         the delivery base.           The deliveryman connects to
                                        -  10   -

the deliveryserver       101via themobile terminal 105, andtransmits
a delivery data request.        Also, the deliveryman connects to the
delivery server 101 via the mobile terminal 105,                  and transmits
information such as each deliveryman's delivery operation data
and undelivered task data.
 [0022]
         (Daily processes)
        Next, the flowchart in FIG. 2 will be used to describe
a series of        daily processes conducted by a delivery system
according to an embodiment.

        Suppose that     a user at     a delivery center connects to the
delivery server 101 via a client computer 103, and transmits
a delivery data creation       instruction.           The delivery server 101
receives the delivery data creation              instruction,       predicts    the
remaining amount of the LP gas in           the gas cylinder for customers
under the jurisdiction of each delivery base on the basis of
data for each customer (past gas usage history,                  meter data, and
cylinder delivery history),             and determines        the next delivery
due date      (S201).   The delivery server 101 generates delivery
data for each delivery base by aggregating the data for customers
whose delivery due date is        the next day (such as a customer ID,
a number of gas cylinders,        and address data) , and each delivery
base's    undelivered task data that           could not be delivered from
among the delivery data tobe         delivered today (such as a customer
ID, a number of gas cylinders,            and address data)        (S202).    Note
that   the generated delivery data is          stored in the delivery server
                                     -   11  -

101 for a fixed period, and the completion of deliveries by
deliverymen may be managed on the basis of delivery operation
data transmitted from the mobile terminals 105.
 [0024]
        Next,     the delivery server 101 assigns                 the delivery data
generated for each delivery base to deliverymen working at                       that
delivery       base,      and      generates       delivery     schedule    data  per
deliveryman (S203) .              The delivery server 101 extracts           the data
of deliverymen working at                a base,      and assigns delivery data on
the   basis      of   a   predetermined           standard.      By  completing   the
generation         of     delivery         schedule       data   per    deliveryman,
preparations are complete for responding to a delivery data
request from the mobile terminal                       105.  After generating the
delivery schedule data per deliveryman, the delivery server 101
may transmit a message notifying                  the mobile terminal 105 of this
state.
 [0025]
        When a deliveryman connects to the delivery server 101
via their mobile terminal                  105 and transmits a delivery data
request, the delivery server 101 conducts an authentication
process        that      checks       identification          information     of  the
deliveryman,          and    transmits        the    delivery    schedule   data  per
deliveryman corresponding to the authenticated                        deliveryman to
the mobile terminal               105   (S204).
 [0026]
        The deliveryman makes deliveries                  to customers on the basis
of thedeliveryscheduledataperdeliveryman.                           Duringdelivery,
                                            -  12   -

the deliveryman generates delivery operation data via the mobile
terminal 105,     and transmits the delivery operation data to the
delivery      server   101   (S205).      The  delivery    operation        data
includes a customer ID and the container barcodes of the exchanged
gas cylinders.       Note that a container barcode may be scanned
by using a barcode reader function of the mobile terminal 105.
At this    point, during delivery, the deliveryman may perform work
in addition to exchanging gas cylinders, such as reading the
gas meter and inspecting the gas supply equipment.             In thiscase,
the    deliveryman     may  generate    delivery    operation     data      that
includes additional       work data via the mobile terminal 105,              and
transmit the delivery operation data to the delivery server 101.
 [0027]
         The delivery server 101 receives the delivery operation
data, and on the basis      of the received delivery operation data,
sets    a delivered state    for the delivery data in       which delivery
was    completed    by  the   deliveryman     (S206) .  If    the    delivery
operationdata includes additionalworkdata, the deliveryserver
101 uses the additional work data to update the storage unit
included in the delivery server 101.
 [0028]
         Hypothetically, if    delivery could not be completed on that
day for a portion of customers included in         the delivery schedule
data per deliveryman, the deliveryman generates              deliveryman's
undelivered task data via the mobile terminal 105,            and transmits
the     deliveryman's undelivered task data to the delivery server
101    (S207).   In  an embodiment,      the deliveryman's undelivered
                                   -  13   -

task data may be configured to include a customer ID for which
a delivery could not be completed.
 [0029]
          The  delivery    server    101      receives      each       deliveryman's
undelivered task data, and on the basis of the received each
deliveryman's undelivered task data, updates the delivery data
that    was stored in     S202   (S208) .      If   deliveryman's undelivered
task data includes a customer ID for which a delivery could not
be completed, the customer ID is           used to set      anundelivered state
for the customer ID included in              the deliveryman's undelivered
task data from among the delivery data.                    The updated delivery
data may be used to create each delivery base's                   undelivered task
data in S202 the following day.
 [0030]
          (Periodic processes)
          Next, the flowchart in FIG. 3 will be used to describe
a series      of periodic processes conducted by a delivery system
according to an embodiment.
 [0031]
          Suppose that   a user at     a delivery center connects to the
delivery server 101 via a client computer 103, and transmits
a delivery count rank setting          instruction.           The delivery server
101 receives the delivery count rank setting                      instruction,       and
for each deliveryman,         obtains a total         transmitted           count and a
total actual count within a designated period from a storage
unit     included in the delivery server 101                   (S301).         The total
transmitted      count is  a total   of the number of cylinders included
                                     -   14    -

in    the    delivery    schedule      data     per  deliveryman    within      the
designated period.           The total actual count is a total of the
number of cylinders that were delivered on the scheduled day
from among the number of cylinders                  included in the delivery
schedule data per deliveryman within the designated period.
 [0032]
          After the total transmitted count and the total actual
count are obtained, the undelivered task rate                in  the designated
period is calculated             (S302).
undelivere d task rate = total transmitte d count - total actual count x 100
                                       total transmitte d count
 [0033]
          Next, the delivery server 101 obtains for each deliveryman
a stipulated number of             attendances and an actual number of
attendances from a storage unit             included in    the delivery server
101 (S303).       The stipulated       number of attendances is       the number
of days after subtracting public holidays from the number of
days within the designated period, while the actual number of
attendances is       the number of days that          the deliveryman worked
within the designated period.               After the stipulated       number of
attendances and the actual number of attendances are obtained,
the work attendance rate           in the designated period is       calculated
(S304).
work attendance rate           actual number of attendance s x 100
                            stipulated number of attendance s
 [0 0 34]
                                       -  15   -

       The delivery server 101 sets            the delivery count rank of
each deliveryman on the basis        of the calculated      undelivered task
rate and work attendance rate             (S305).
 [0035]
        (Configuration of delivery server)
       Next, a configuration of the delivery server 101 discussed
above will   be described in      detail      with reference to the block
diagram in   FIG. 4.    Note that    although FIG. 4 envisions a single
computer system and illustrates            only the necessary functional
configuration,     the delivery server 101 may also be configured
as part of a multi-functional distributed system made up of
multiple computer systems.
 [0036]
       The delivery server 101 includes a configuration in                which
RAM   403,  an   input     device    404,     and   output    device   405,     a
communication     control    device      406,   and a    storage   device     407
provided with a non-volatile          storage medium (such as ROM or an
HDD) are connected to a CPU 401 via a systembus 402.              The storage
device 407 is   provided with a program storage area that               stores
software programs forperforming the above functions, and a data
storage area that     stores    information such as data obtained as
needed and data as a processing result.                The respective units
of the program storage area described hereinafter                are actually
independent software programs,            or sub-routines or components
thereof.    Additionally,       the    respective      unit   above  performs
respective functions by being called from the storage device
407 and loaded into      a work area of the RAM 403 by the CPU 401,
                                   -   16   -

and       by     being       sequentially      executed         while       appropriately
referencing information such as a database.
 [0037]
           The data storage area is           provided with a deliveryman data
storage unit            408,  a delivery performance storage unit                  409, and
a delivery performance history                 storage unit        410.      All are fixed
storage areas reserved inside the storage device 407.
 [0038]
           The deliveryman data storage unit                 408 stores        information
related        to deliverymen.         In an embodiment,         the deliveryman data
storage unit 408 stores a delivery base code identifying the
deliverybase towhich the deliveryman is assigned, adeliveryman
code       identifying         the   deliveryman,       a    name,      and     a rank,  as
illustrated            in FIGS.   5A and 5B.     The rank expresses the number
of gas cylinders that              the deliveryman is         able to deliver        in one
day.
 [0039]
           The      delivery      performance        storage        unit       409   stores
informationrelated              todeliveryperformance.                Inanembodiment,
the delivery performance storage unit                   409 stores        a delivery base
code, a deliveryman code, a total transmitted count, a total
actual count, a stipulated number of attendances, an actual
number of attendances,               and a progress flag           indicating       whether
or not progress is             being checked,       as illustrated           from FIGS.  6A
to 6C, and manages the performance of each deliveryman in a
designated period.                In the present embodiment,                  the periodic
processes            are    assumed     to   be   executed         monthly,        and  the
                                           -  17  -

are accumulated in             the delivery performance storage unit               409.
 [0040]
         The      delivery        base    code        and   the   deliveryman      code
respectively          include corresponding codes in the deliveryman data
storage unit          408.   The total      transmitted       count includes a total
of the number of cylinders included in the delivery schedule
data per deliveryman from the first                      day to the last   day of the
month.       The total      actual count includes a total              of the number
of cylinders that          were delivered on the scheduled day from among
the number of cylinders included in                     the delivery schedule data
per deliveryman from the first                  day to the last     day of the month.
The stipulated          number of attendances includes the number of days
after     subtracting       public holidays from the number of days from
the first        day to the last       day of the month.          The actual number
of attendances includes the number of days that                      the deliveryman
attended work from the first                  day to the last      day of the month.
The progress flag           is   off "0" if      progress is     not being checked,
and is on "1"           if progress is being checked.
 [0041]
         The delivery performance history                   storage unit   410 stores
information related              to a history        of delivery performance.         In
an embodiment, the delivery performance history storage unit
410 stores a delivery base code, a deliveryman code, a total
transmitted count, a total actual count, a total undelivered
task count, an undelivered task rate, a stipulated number of
attendances,          an actual number of attendances,             a work attendance

         Lastly, the rank setting         unit     413 sets       the delivery count
rank of each deliveryman on the basis of the undelivered task

rate.       In an embodiment, if the total undelivered task count
is   a single-digit        number,   the undelivered task rate             is  less than
1%,    and the work attendance rate           is   100%,   the rank setting         unit

relevant deliveryman in             the deliveryman data storage unit               408.
Also, if the undelivered task rate is from 5.0% to 9.9%, the
rank setting         unit   413 determines that       the relevant deliveryman
is   to be subjected to a progress check.                   In     an embodiment,     if
the progress check continues for two months,                      the delivery count
rank is        set by subtracting 5 from the rank of the                        relevant
deliveryman           in    the   deliveryman        data     storage         unit  408.
Furthermore,          if  the undelivered task rate            is    10% or more,    the
rank setting        unit   413 sets  the delivery count rank by subtracting
5 from the rank of the relevant deliveryman in                         the deliveryman

 [0059]
         In    the present embodiment,              for the deliveryman with the
deliveryman code 3, the progress flag setting is 0, and thus
the process proceeds to                S810,       and the progress             flag of    the
deliveryman with the deliveryman code 3 is set                      to 1, as illustrated
in   FIG.    6C.    For the deliveryman with the deliveryman code 4,
the progress flag          setting       is    1,  and thus the process proceeds
to S811,        and the progress flag of the deliveryman with the
deliveryman code          4 is       set to 0,        as  illustrated in FIG. 6C.

         In other words, the deliveryman code 3 with a progress
flag   setting     of 0 in S809 was not in the yellow zone in the delivery
count rank setting        process performed last               month (June 30,         2012),
and thus the progress flag              is    set to 1,   indicating         that    progress
is being checked.            On the other hand, the deliveryman code 4
with a progress flag           setting        of 1 in   S809 was in      the yellow zone
in   the delivery count rank setting                  process performed last             month
 (June 30,       2012),  and thus a progress check has continued for
two months.         As a result,       the delivery rank is              set      to low,  and
the progress flag is initialized to 0.

via a client        computer 103,       and transmits a delivery performance
output instruction.
 [0066]
          The   delivery        performance       outputting      unit    414      of   the
delivery server 101 receives the delivery performance output
instruction,         and uses the deliveryman data storage unit                   408 and
the delivery performance history                  storage unit       410 to transmit
a delivery performance display to the client                      computer 103.           In
an embodiment, as illustrated               in FIG. 9, the deliveryperformance
outputting unit           414 may highlight         the total      undelivered        task
count, undelivered task rate,               and work attendance rate         that    cause
achangeinthedeliverycountranksetting.                          Also, asillustrated
in   the same drawing,            the delivery performance outputting unit
414 may highlight           the new rank of a deliveryman that            has changed
from the old rank 1.

          Although the present embodiment illustrates                    only a single
deliverybase as an example,            the deliveryperformance outputting
unit      414  may also output         delivery performance              for multiple
delivery bases.
 [0068]
          As above, according to the present invention, by outputting
the delivery performance of a delivery base,                     it   is    possible to
support decision-making regarding the deliveryman's capability
that    shouldbeensuredfor thedeliverybaseoverall,                        while taking
into    account appropriate delivery count ranks.                    In other words,
in the management of personnel to assign to a delivery area,
it     is    possible   to    strive        for     an    appropriate          personnel
configuration that is based on delivery count rank.
 [0069]
          Throughout this   specification           and the claims which follow,
unless the context requires otherwise,                   the word "comprise",          and
variations       such  as    "comprises"          and     "comprising",          will   be
understood to imply the inclusion                  of a stated      integer       or step
or group of integers       or steps but not the exclusion of any other
integer or step or group of integers or steps.
