                                      Background
[1002]      Some embodiments described herein relate generally to wireless sensor
systems, methods and apparatus with switch and outlet control.
[1003]      Known systems exist for remotely controlling power to switches and outlets.
Such system, however, may use long cabling runs to control an individual switch or
outlet. Other known system may frequently use battery power, causing rapid depletion of
onboard batteries and/or may use additional cabling to provide power to local switch and
outlet controllers.
[1004]      Thus, a need exists for a wireless sensor systems, methods and apparatus with
switch and outlet control.

                                  Detailed Description
[1028]      In some embodiments, an apparatus includes a wireless sensor configured to
be operatively coupled to a network gateway device that is configured to receive one of a
first data packet or a second packet from the wireless sensor.       The wireless sensor is
configured to send the first data packet at a first time on a first frequency, the first data
packet including a payload associated with a value of a measurement that was measured
by the wireless sensor. The wireless sensor is configured to send the second data packet
                                               3

at a second time on a second frequency, the second data packet includes a payload
associated with the value.
[1029]       In some embodiments, the wireless sensor is further configured to be
operatively coupled to a wireless repeater that is configured to receive the first data
packet or the second data packet.        In some embodiments, the wireless repeater has a
buffer to store at least one of the first data packet or the second data packet for an amount
of time. In some embodiments, the wireless repeater is a first wireless repeater, and the
first wireless repeater discards the first data packet based on the payload of the first data
packet being the same as the payload of the second data packet when the second data
packet has been sent from a second wireless repeater and the first data packet is stored in
a buffer of the wireless repeater.
[1030]       In some embodiments, the wireless repeater adds a received signal strength
value to the first data packet or the second data packet when the first data packet or the
second data packet is received. In some embodiments the second time is after the first
time, substantially no delay occurs after the first time and before the second time. In
some embodiments the wireless sensor is configured to send the first data packet and the
second data packet independent of an instruction from the network gateway device. In
some embodiments, the wireless sensor is configured to be operatively coupled to a
wireless repeater that (1) receives the first data packet via a first antenna associated with a
first transceiver and (2) receives the second data packet via a second antenna associated
with a second transceiver. In some embodiments the wireless sensor is configured to be
coupled to the network gateway device that (1) selects a first antenna or a second antenna,
based on received signal strength, to receive the first data packet, and (2) selects a third
antenna or a fourth antenna, based on received signal strength, to receive the second data
packet.
[1031]       In some embodiments, an apparatus includes a wireless sensor configured to
be operatively coupled to a network gateway device. The wireless sensor transmits a first
data packet at a first time on a first frequency and a second data packet at a second time
on a second frequency. The apparatus includes at least one wireless repeater configured
to retransmit the first data packet and the second data packet. The wireless repeater has a
first antenna associated with a first transceiver and a second antenna associated with a
second transceiver. The first antenna and first transceiver are configured to receive the
                                                4

first data packet, and the second antenna and second transceiver are configured to receive
the second data packet. The apparatus includes a network gateway device configured to
receive one of the first data packet or the second data packet.
[1032]       In some embodiments at least one wireless repeater including a buffer to store
at least one of the first data packet or the second data packet for an amount of time. In
some embodiments at least one wireless repeater is configured to add a received signal
strength value to the first data packet or the second data packet when the first data packet
or the second data packet is received. In some embodiments the second time is after the
first time, substantially no delay occurs after the first time and before the second time. In
some embodiments the wireless sensor is configured to send the first data packet and the
second data packet independent of an instruction from the network gateway device.
[1033]       In some embodiments, an apparatus includes a wireless sensor including an
antenna portion and configured to be operatively coupled, via the antenna portion, to a
network gateway device. The wireless sensor includes a housing configured to be at least
partially disposed within an electrical enclosure.      The wireless sensor is configured to
send, to the network gateway device a signal indicative of a value of a characteristic of
the wireless sensor.
[1034] In some embodiments the wireless sensor is configured to send the signal using a
dipole antenna. In such embodiments the antenna portion is a first half of the dipole
antenna and a metal portion of the electrical enclosure is a second half of the dipole
antenna. In some embodiments the wireless sensor is configured to send the signal using
an antenna. In such embodiments, the antenna portion is a monopole element of the
antenna and a metal portion of the electrical enclosure is a ground plane for the monopole
element.    In some embodiments a ground of the wireless sensor is isolated from the
electrical enclosure by a dielectric.    In some embodiments the antenna portion of the
wireless sensor is configured to be operatively coupled to a metal portion of the junction
box that is an antenna ground plane.         In some embodiments the wireless sensor is
configured to be operatively coupled to a battery disposed within the housing. In some
embodiments the wireless sensor includes an energy harvester device separate from an
energy source associated with the junction box. In some embodiments the characteristic
is an energy usage. In some embodiments the wireless sensor includes an alternating
                                               5

current outlet. In some embodiments the wireless sensor includes an alternating current
switch. In some embodiments the characteristic is a status of the switch.
[1035]       A wireless sensor system can be used to measure and monitor environmental
characteristics of, for example, a room of a building, characteristics of a wireless sensor
itself, for example, whether a plug is in use, and/or to effect a characteristic of a room or
the wireless sensor. By way of example, a wireless sensor can include a light or outlet
switch configured to sense and/or control whether an electrical switch controlling a light
or outlet is opened or closed. In another example, a wireless sensor can include carbon
monoxide sensor configured to measure a level of carbon monoxide in an area. In some
embodiments, aspects of a wireless sensor system can be retrofitted into an existing
system without the need to make additional changes to the existing system. For example,
a light switch type wireless sensor described herein can replace an existing light switch
without the need to add additional wiring, replace junction boxes, etc.
[1036]       As used in this specification, the singular forms "a," "an" and "the" include
plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Thus, for example, the term
"a data packet" is intended to mean a data packet or a combination of data packets.
[1037]       FIG. I is a schematic illustration of a wireless sensor system ("system") 100
according to an embodiment, system 100 includes a wireless sensor 110. In some
embodiments, at least a portion of the wireless sensor 110 may be disposed within an
electrical enclosure (not shown). System 100 includes a wireless repeater 130, a wireless
repeater 130', and a network gateway device 140.
[1038]       System 100 includes a wireless sensor 110 that is configured to measure a
characteristic of wireless sensor 110 and/or of a room with which wireless sensor 110 is
located. In some embodiments, wireless sensor 110 can include an environmental sensor,
for example, to measure a temperature, pressure, carbon gas levels, humidity etc. In some
embodiments, wireless sensor 110 can include an area sensor, for example, to measure
motion, light level, proximity, touch, etc. In some embodiments, wireless sensor 110 can
include an electrical sensor, for example, to measure and/or control an energy usage,
switch state, outlet state, etc. In some embodiments, at least a portion of wireless sensor
110 can be disposed within the electrical enclosure. In some embodiments, an electrical
enclosure can be a standard electrical junction box, for example, a metal and/or plastic
                                               6

box that is configured to be disposed in and/or on a wall and/or other support, and that is
configured to house one or more electrical connections and/or associated components, for
example, switches, outlets, etc.      In some embodiments, the electrical enclosure can
generally be any enclosure normally used to house AC or DC wiring electrical
connections, such as grounded enclosures (e.g. light fixtures, breaker boxes, distribution
panels, etc.). In some embodiments, wireless sensor 110 can include a sensor module
(not shown in FIG. 1), processor module (not shown in FIG. 1), a first radio module (not
shown in FIG. 1), a second radio module (not shown in FIG. 1), a first antenna (not
shown in FIG. 1), a second antenna (not shown in FIG. 1).          In some embodiments,
wireless sensor 110 can include a battery (not shown), a switch (not shown), an analog-to
digital converter (not shown), ports (not shown), interfaces (not shown), etc. In some
embodiments, wireless sensor 110 can operate as a wireless repeater, for example, similar
to wireless repeater 130 described below, for other wireless sensors.
[1039]      Wireless sensor 110 can include the sensor module to measure a value of a
characteristic of wireless sensor 110 and/or an environment within which wireless sensor
110 is located. For example, the sensor module can measure an environmental value
(temperature, pressure, motion etc), a motion and/or occupancy value, and/or a
characteristic and/or state of an electrical component associated with wireless sensor 110
(open or closed light switch, electrical outlet plugged in or in use, etc).       In some
embodiments, the sensor module can be included in the processor module. The sensor
module can measure the value at a predetermined time and/or on a predetermined
schedule, in response to an event, etc. The sensor module can provide the value of a
measurement to the processor module. In some embodiments, sensor module 110 can
include a clock module (not shown) to prompt a measurement based on the predetermined
time and/or schedule.     In such embodiments, the clock module can include a "loose
tolerance" of between about 5-10%.         In such an embodiment, the clock module can
include an RC based oscillator to implement the loose tolerance. In such embodiments,
the RC based oscillator can be included in the processor module.        In this manner, a
system 100 that includes more than one wireless sensor 110 that each includes a clock
module having substantially the same setting can, via radio/antenna sets, send signals at
different times to reduce communication collisions. In some such embodiments, the
clock can determine when a measurement is taken and/or when a data packet including
the value of the measurement is sent. The predetermined time for measuring a value
                                               7

and/or transmitting an associated packet can be programmed, user adjustable via an input
device, event driven, randomly derived, or set by network gateway device 140.
[1040]       Wireless sensor 110 can include a processor module to define at least one data
packet including values associated with measurements of the sensor module. The sensor
module can define one or more copies of the one or more data packets. A data packet can
include sensor data (e.g. value of measurement taken by the sensor module), control data
(e.g. a switch has been opened or closed), control requests (e.g. should a switch be opened
or closed), network identification information (e.g. node identification number, network
identification number), security information (e.g. data encryption key), etc.           The
processor module can include a computer processor or microprocessor and/or memory,
for example a random access memory (RAM), a memory buffer, a hard drive, a database,
an erasable programmable read-only memory (EPROM), an electrically erasable read
only memory (EEPROM), and/or so forth. Memory can be used to hold data such as, but
not limited to, schedules, set points, instructions, etc. for use to control or communicate
data to wireless sensor 110, repeaters 130, 131', or network gateway device 140. In this
manner, the processor module stores and sends the at least one data packet and the one or
more copies of the at least one data packet to the first radio and/or to the second radio at
different times. In this manner, wireless sensor 110 can send a data packet, which may
include the value of the measurement, control data, control requests etc, at more than one
time and from more than one antenna.
[1041]       Wireless sensor 110 can include one or more transmitter sets, for example a
first transmitter set (e.g, the first radio and the associated first antenna), and a second
transmitter set (e.g., the second radio and associated second antenna), to transmit data
packets including a value of a measurement, control data, control requests etc from
wireless sensor 110 to, for example, wireless repeaters 130, 130'. A transmitter set can
transmit a data packet using any modulation type, for example Direct Sequence Spread
Spectrum (DSSS)        or Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum (FHSS).                In some
embodiments, a hybrid DSSS and FSSS system, frequency hopping direct sequence
spread spectrum (FHDSSS), can be used spreading data packets across both frequency
and time to reduce the probability of interference from other transmitter sets (e.g., within
wireless sensor 110, another wireless sensor, or another device including a transmitter
set). In a hybrid system, the data packet can be transmitted using a DSSS signal that can
                                               8

be hopped from channel to channel to increase robustness. In some embodiments, the
first antenna and/or the second antenna can be a dipole (e.g., onmidirectional) antenna or
can be a patch (e.g., directional) antenna.
[1042]       In some embodiments, each transmitter set of wireless sensor 110 can operate
on a different channel substantially simultaneously. In some embodiments, a transmitter
set of wireless sensor 110 can operate on two or more different channel sequentially. In
this manner, wireless sensor 110 may not need to verify that other components of system
100 are operating on a particular channel. In other words, by sending a copy of a data
packet on multiple channels of system 100, the other components of system 100 should
receive at least one of the data packet and/or the copies of the data packet. In some such
embodiments, and as discussed below, other components of system 100 can include
multiple transmitter sets, such that those components can receive at least one of the data
packet and/or copies of the data packet. In such embodiments, an amount of energy used
to send a data packet and/or copies of a data packet at multiple times and/or on multiple
channels can be lower than the energy used to verify a component is operating on a
particular channel. In such embodiments, a first channel and a second channel can be
substantially opposite ends of the frequency band to maximize the probability that any
source of potential interference is avoided by the other channel. As an example wireless
sensor 110 can transmit, substantially simultaneously or sequentially, on a first channel at
903MHz and on a second channel at 927MHz in the 902-928MHz band.
[1043]       In some embodiments, and as described above, wireless sensor 110 can send a
data packet and/or copies of the data packet on two or more channels and at two or more
times. In such embodiments, wireless sensor 110 can be in a sleep mode (or other low
power or zero power mode of operation) for a portion of the time to conserve the power
of a power supply (e.g., battery). At the predetermined interval and/or schedule, wireless
sensor 110 can awake from the sleep mode and can be in an active mode. Wireless sensor
110 can measure a value of a characteristic and define a data packet including the value.
Wireless sensor 110 can define a data packet including control data or control requests.
In such embodiments, as discussed above, wireless sensor 110 can send a data packet via
a first transmitter set at a first time, and then send a first copy of the data packet from the
first transmitter set at a second time, after the first time. In such embodiments, wireless
sensor 110 can send a second copy of the data packet via a second transmitter set at a
                                                 9

third time, and then send a third copy of the data packet from the second transmitter set at
a fourth time, after the third time.
[1044]      In some embodiments, wireless sensor 110 can receive data for setup of
system 100, including a network ID, security features, and a wireless sensor identification
numbers. In some embodiments, after the setup of system 100, wireless sensor 110 can
be designated as a transmit-only wireless sensor. In some embodiments, wireless sensor
110 can periodically send a status request data packet to network gateway device 140, via
wireless repeater 130 and wireless repeater 130' if necessary, and can be designated as a
transmit/receive device to receive commends.
[1045]      System 100 includes wireless repeater 130 configured to receive data packets
from wireless sensor 110 and/or wireless repeater 130', and to send data packets to
network gateway device 140.         System 100 includes wireless repeater 130', similar to
wireless repeater 130, and configured to receive data packets from wireless sensor 110
and to send data packets to wireless repeater 130.         Wireless repeaters 130,130' can
include a computer/micro processor or microprocessor and/or memory, for example a
random access memory (RAM), a memory buffer, a hard drive, a database, an erasable
programmable read-only memory (EPROM), an electrically erasable read-only memory
(EEPROM), and/or so forth. Memory may be used to hold data such as, but not limited
to, schedules, set points, instructions, etc. for use to control or communicate data to
wireless sensor 110, repeaters 130, 131', or network gateway device 140. In this manner,
wireless repeaters 130, 130' can store received data packets for a predetermined period of
time in a buffer. In some embodiments, the buffer of a wireless repeater can store a
received data packet and can compare the data packet to other data packets in the buffer
and/or data packets that have been recently received and/or forwarded.              In such
embodiments, the wireless repeater can discard duplicate data packets.           By way of
example, wireless repeater 130 can receive a first data packet from wireless sensor 110,
and can receive a second data packet, identical to the first data packet, from wireless
sensor 110 via wireless repeater 130'. In such embodiments, wireless repeater 130 can
discard either the first data packet or the second data packet, for example, based on which
was received first (e.g., first in first out, "FIFO"), which has a stronger received signal
strength, and/or another metric. In some embodiments, wireless repeater 130 can discard
packets after a period of time, for example 5 seconds.
                                               10

[10461      Wireless repeaters 130,130' can include at least one transmitter set to receive
and/or send signals, including data packets.     In some embodiments, wireless repeaters
130,130' can include at least the same number of transmitter sets as wireless sensor 110.
In this manner, wireless repeaters 130,130' can send and receive any data packet sent
from wireless sensor 110. By way of example, wireless sensor 110 can include a first
transmitter set sending data packets on a first channel and at a first time and a second
time, and can include a second transmitter set sending data packets on a second channel
and at a third time and a fourth time. In such an example, wireless repeaters 130,130' can
include a first transmitter set operating on the first channel and a second transmitter set
operating on the second channel such that either of wireless repeaters 130,130' can
receive four copies of a data packet. By way of example, wireless sensor 110 can include
a first transmitter set sending data packets on a first channel at a first time and second
channel at a second time.      In such an example, wireless repeaters 130,130' can each
include a first transmitter set operating on the first channel and a second transmitter set
operating on the second channel such that either of wireless repeaters 130,130' can
receive two copies of a data packet without a need to switch between the channels. In
such an example, the system 100 can include multiple frequencies, multiple times,
multiple data paths, and multiple antennas, i.e. the system 100 has frequency diversity,
time diversity, spatial diversity, and antenna diversity. Said another way, the system 100
has concurrent frequency, time, spatial, and antenna diversity.         By way of another
example, wireless repeaters 130,130' can each include a first transmitter set sending or
receiving data packets on a first channel at a first time and a second transmitter set
sending or receiving data packets on a second channel at a second time.         In such an
example, the first time and the second time may overlap.
[1047]      In some embodiments, wireless repeaters 130,130' can calculate a received
signal strength indication (RSSI) upon receipt of a data packet. In such embodiments,
wireless repeaters 130,130' can add this data to the data packet, for example, at the end of
a data packet payload. In this manner, network gateway device 140 can examine the
RSSI data for each hop between wireless sensor 110 and network gateway device 140. In
some such embodiments, network gateway device 140 can use the added data to
determine a number of hops between wireless sensor 110 and network gateway device
140. In such embodiments, network gateway device 140 can compare the number of hops
                                             11

actually used to an expected number of hops, for example, to determine an efficiency
and/or health of system 100.
[1048]       System 100 includes network gateway device 140 configured to receive data
packets from wireless repeater 130,130' or directly from wireless sensor 110. Network
gateway device 140 can receive data packets using a wireless protocol, for example, with
one or more transmitter sets, and can convert the data packets to a wired protocol for
further transmission via a wired network (not shown) coupled to the network gateway
device 140. By way of example, network gateway device 140 can transform data packets
received in a wireless format, for example 802.15.4, WiFi, cellular (GSM, CDMA, etc.),
or satellite, and convert them into a different wireless protocol and/or a wired protocol
such as 1) Ethernet: BACnet/IP, BACnet/Ethernet, Modbus TCP, Ethenet/IP, Omron
FINS, DNP3, SNMP, XML             2) RS-485: BACnet/MSTP, Metasys N2, Modbus RTU,
JBus, DNP, YorkTalk, Allen Bradley DF1, and 3) FTT-10: LonWorks.                   In some
embodiments, network gateway device 140 can convert the data packets to a wireless
protocol for further transmission via a wireless network (not shown) such as for example
802.15.4, WiFi, cellular (GSM, CDMA, etc.), or satellite wireless networks.         In such
embodiments, network gateway device or wireless repeaters can have one or more
input/outputs, each input/output configured to operate using a different protocol. By way
of example, with respect to a building, network gateway device 140 can include a first
input/output operating using the BACnet/IP protocol for communication with a building
heating, ventilation, and air conditioning system, can include a second input/output
operating using the TCP/IP protocol for communication via a network, such as the
internet, for viewing on a browser based page, and can include a third input/output
operating using a serial bus connection (e.g., universal serial bus) for local (e.g., at
network gateway device 140) communication, configuration, etc. The input/outputs can
be used, for example, for monitoring, graphing, alarming (via email, text message, or
other method), setup of the wireless network, etc.
[1049]       Similar to wireless repeaters 130,130' described above, in some embodiments,
network gateway device 140 can include the same number of transmitter sets as wireless
sensor 110 and/or wireless repeaters 130,130'. In this manner, network gateway device
140 can send and/or receive any data packet sent from wireless sensor 110 and/or from
wireless repeaters 130,130'.     Similar to wireless repeaters 130,130' and wireless sensor
                                              12

110, network gateway device 140 can include a computer/micro processor and/or
memory, for example a random access memory (RAM), a memory buffer, a hard drive, a
database, an erasable programmable read-only memory (EPROM), an electrically
erasable read-only memory (EEPROM), and/or so forth. Memory can be used to hold
data such as, but not limited to, schedules, set points, instructions, etc. for use to control
or communicate data to wireless sensor 110, repeaters 130, 131', or network gateway
device 140.    In this manner, the network gateway device 140 can store and send data
packets, for example prior to and/or after conversion from a first protocol to a second
protocol, as described above, or in response to data received from the one or more
input/outputs.
[1050]      In some embodiments, network gateway device 140 can coordinate the
frequency of the channel (or channels for multiple transmission set embodiments) at
which wireless      sensor   110 and wireless repeaters       130,130'   operate.     In such
embodiments, network gateway device can transmit a periodic instruction to switch
channel(s) and/or network ID. In such an embodiment, network gateway device 140 can
send such an instruction, for example, every ten seconds. In some embodiments, whether
an instruction is sent, for example to change channel(s), and what the instruction includes,
can be based on the health of the network, for example the number of hops a data packet
takes, the RSSI of data packet transmissions, etc.         In some embodiments, network
gateway device 140 can coordinate the security of the wireless system 100 by transferring
security data, wirelessly or via a wired connection, such as a security key, to the wireless
sensor 110 and wireless repeaters 130,130'.
[1051]      FIG. 2 is a schematic illustration of a wireless sensor 210 at least partially
disposed within an electrical enclosure 220. Wireless sensor 210 can be similar to and
can include similar components to wireless sensor described above.              For example,
wireless sensor 210 can include a processor 216 that can be similar to the processor
described above with respect to wireless sensor 110.        Wireless sensor 210 includes a
sensor module 214, the processor 216, a radio 262, a radio 262', an antenna 264, and an
antenna 264'. In some embodiments, radio 262, 262' can include more than one antenna,
for example, radio 262 includes antenna 264 and can include a second antenna (not
shown).   In such an embodiment, wireless sensor 210 can select whichever of antenna
264 or the second antenna has a stonger RSSI for use by radio 262.

[1052]      FIG. 3 is a schematic illustration of a wireless sensor system ("system") 300
according to an embodiment, system 300 can be similar to system 100 and can include
similar components.     For example, system 300 includes a wireless sensor 310 that is
similar to wireless sensor 110 and at least a portion of which can be disposed within an
electrical enclosure (not shown). System 300 includes a wireless repeater 330, a wireless
repeater 330', and a network gateway device 340. Unlike wireless sensor 110 as shown
in FIG. 1, wireless sensor 310 includes an energy source 312 configured to supply
wireless sensor 310 with energy independent of an energy supply (not shown) of the
electrical enclosure 320. In some embodiments, energy source 312 can include a battery,
for example battery using stable battery chemistry, such as Lithium Thionyl Chloride or
Lithium Iron Disulfide, that can chemically last up to and beyond 25 years.         In some
embodiments,     energy source 312 can include an energy harvester, alone or in
combination with a battery. In some embodiments, an energy harvesting device can be,
for example, similar to an energy harvesting device described in U.S. Patent No.
7,868,482,    entitled  "METHOD       AND    APPARATUS        FOR HIGH EFFICIENCY
RECTIFICATION FOR VARIOUS LOADS," which is incorporated by reference herein.
[1053]      FIG. 4 is a schematic illustration of a wireless sensor system ("system") 400
according to an embodiment. System 400 can be similar to system 100 and can include
similar components.     For example, system 400 includes a wireless sensor 410 that is
similar to wireless sensor 110 and at least a portion of which can be disposed within an
electrical enclosure (not shown). System 400 includes a wireless repeater 430, a wireless
repeater 430', and a network gateway device 440. Unlike system 100 as shown in FIG. 1,
system 400 includes a network gateway device 440'.          In such embodiments, network
gateway devices 440, 441' can be configured to receive data packets from wireless sensor
410 and wireless repeaters 430,430'. In this manner, if one of network gateway devices
440, 440' should fail, the other of network gateway devices 440, 440' can continue to
operate. In some embodiments network gateway device 440 can be associated with a first
wired network and network gateway device 440' can be associated with a second wired
network, at least a portion of which can be different from the first wired network. In
some embodiments, network gateway device 440 can be in communication with a portion
of a set of wireless repeaters and/or wireless sensors (not shown in its entirety) of system
400, and network gateway device 440' can be in communication with a different portion
of the set of wireless repeaters and/or wireless sensors of system 400.             In such
                                             14

embodiments, either of wireless repeaters 430,430' can be included in the portion of the
plurality of wireless repeaters and/or in the different portion of the set of wireless
repeaters.
[1054]      In some embodiments, it may be necessary to install a new network gateway
device (not shown) or a second network gateway device (not shown) within the wireless
sensor system. This can be performed using a listen mode initiated by a button press on
the network gateway device 440,440' or by using a computer interface on the network
gateway device 440,440' and graphical user interface. As an example, the wireless sensor
410 can be connected to the network gateway device 440,440' by connecting a mini-USB
cable between the wireless sensor 410 and the network gateway device 440,440'. At this
time, the network gateway device 440,440' will instruct the wireless sensor 410 via the
cable to set the appropriate channel and network ID and assign the wireless sensor 410 a
unique wireless sensor ID. If a network gateway device 440,440' ceases to operate, a
new network gateway device 440,440' can be deployed by enabling listen mode to listen
to the network for a predetermined period of time and store the IDs of all wireless sensors
410 and map the wireless sensor 410 data to the appropriate memory location.
[1055]      FIG. 5 is a schematic illustration of a wireless sensor system ("system") 500
according to an embodiment. System 500 can be similar to system 100 and can include
similar components.     For example, system 500 includes a wireless sensor 510 that is
similar to wireless sensor 110 and at least a portion of which can be disposed within an
electrical enclosure (not shown). System 500 includes a wireless repeater 530, a wireless
repeater 530', and a network gateway device 540. As shown in FIG. 5, wireless sensor
510 can send a data packet C at a time t, shown as C(t). Wireless repeater 530 can
receive the data packet C from wireless sensor 510 and can determine by comparison to
its buffer in memory that the data packet C has not been sent by wireless repeater 530.
Wireless repeater 530 can randomly delay between about 25ms to 100ms and can then
broadcast the data packet C packet at time (t+y), shown as C(t+y). In some embodiments,
because data packet C is broadcast, wireless sensor 510 can receive data packet C, the
receipt of which can be an acknowledgement of a successful transmission.             In the
example, wireless repeater 530' can receive data packet C and can determine by
comparison to its buffer in memory that the packet has not been sent by wireless repeater
530'. Wireless repeater 530' can randomly delay between about 25ms to 100ms and can
                                             15

then broadcast the packet at time (t+x), shown as C(t+x).        The packet C(t+x) can be
received by wireless repeater 530. Wireless repeater 530 can compare data packet C(t+x)
to its buffer in memory, can determined that data packet C(t+y), equivalent to data packet
C(t+x) has already been sent, and can discard and/or otherwise ignore data packet C(t+x).
[1056]       FIG. 6 is a schematic illustration of a wireless sensor 610 and a network
gateway device 640 operatively coupled by a cable 650.            Wireless sensor 610 and
network gateway device 640 can be similar to wireless sensor 110 and network gateway
device 140, respectively.      FIG. 6 depicts a temporary hardwire connection between
wireless sensor 610 and network gateway device 640, for example, during an initial setup
process. Network gateway device 640 can assign network ID, channels, data encryption,
security keys, and/or any other security feature.
[1057]       FIG. 7 is an illustration of wireless sensor 710, specifically, a rocker type
switch. FIG. 8 is an illustration of a front view of a wireless sensor 810, and FIG. 9 is an
illustration of a side view of wireless sensor 810, specifically toggle (e.g., momentary)
type switch.     Wireless sensors 710, 810 can be similar to and can include similar
components to wireless sensor 110 described above. Wireless sensors 710, 810 can be
configured to be disposed within a standard junction box. In some such embodiments,
wireless sensors 710, 810 can include three terminals, and/or wires, to be coupled to a
load line, a hot line, and a ground without the need for a neutral wire.           In such
embodiments, power for operation of the wireless sensor 710, 810 can be obtained by a
battery (not shown) contained within the wireless sensor 710,810 that can be mounted at
least partially in the junction box. In some embodiments, wireless sensors 710, 810 can
harvest energy by trickling a small amount of current from the load line to the ground
connection.
[1058]       FIGS. 10-15 are schematic illustrations of wireless sensors according to
embodiments described herein. Specifically, FIG. 10 illustrates a wireless sensor 1010
including an antenna 1064 disposed within a junction box 1020; FIG. 11 illustrates a
wireless sensor 1110 including an antenna 1164 disposed outside a junction box 1120;
FIG. 12 illustrates a wireless sensor 1210 including an energy harvester 1212 in a first
configuration; FIG. 13 illustrates a wireless sensor 1310 including an energy harvester
1312 in a second configuration; FIG. 14 illustrates a wireless sensor 1410 including an
energy harvester 1412 in a third configuration; and FIG. 15 illustrates a wireless sensor
                                              16

1510 including a power supply 1513 operatively coupled to a junction box 1520. By way
of example, a wireless sensor, for example, wireless sensors 1010, 1110, 1210, 1310,
1410, 1510 can include a light or outlet switch configured to sense and/or control whether
an electrical switch controlling a light or outlet is opened or closed.
[1059]       Referring to FIG. 10, wireless sensor 1010 can be at least partially disposed
within electrical enclosure 1020, and can include a processor module 1016, a radio 1062,
an antenna 1064, a button 1066, a current transformer 1072, a switch 1074 (as an example
a relay or TRIAC), a DC/DC converter 1076, and a regulator 1078. Wireless sensor 1010
can operate as a light switch. For example, when button 1066 is pressed, lights associated
with wireless sensor 1010 would turn ON or OFF by connecting or disconnecting the load
to the AC mains 1022, 1024 (preferably at 120-277VAC, 50 or 60Hz). Wireless sensor
1010 can be configured such that, when button 1066 is pressed on, an interrupt is
generated within the processor 1016, which can bring wireless sensor 1010 out of a sleep
mode. The processor 1016 can toggle a state of switch 1074 to power or de-power a load
(e.g. lights) coupled to wireless sensor 1010. Processor 1016 can send, using radio 1062
and antenna 1064, a change of state of wireless sensor 1010, based on, for example, a
state of switch 1074, to, for example, a building automation system (BAS) via a wireless
sensor system, for example, as described above. In some embodiments, processor 1016
can store the state of the switch and go back to sleep. In such embodiments, processor
1016 can transmit data packets associated with the state on a predetermined schedule
and/or at a predetermined interval. Current transformer 1072 can measure an amount of
current provided to the load and can send a value if the current provided to the data
processor 1016, such that the data processor 1016 can define and send a data packet can
to, for example, the BAS, via a wireless sensor system. In some embodiments, antenna
1064 can use at least a portion of electrical enclosure 1020 as part of the antenna 1064. In
such embodiments, a radio frequency (RF) current can flow on the exterior of the
electrical enclosure 1020 in support of radiation of the wireless (RF) data signal.
[1060]       In some embodiments, the BAS can monitor the energy usage of the load. In
such embodiments, a building having many standard (e.g., not wireless sensors) switches,
outlets, and sensors, can be retrofitted with wireless sensors described herein to allow the
BAS to wirelessly control the loads on all switches and outlets, in addition to local control
by a user.     In some embodiments, a BAS may have a schedule of when a room is
                                              17

occupied and unoccupied and use that data to switch ON and OFF wireless sensors within
that room. In such embodiments, a user can be in a room labeled unoccupied, and can
manually operate the switch to enable the load. In some embodiments, a wireless sensor
can include a timer to maintain an ON state a predetermined or programmable time such
as one hour. In such embodiments, the wireless sensor can listen for data from the BAS
as to whether the room is still labeled unoccupied based on the schedule. When the room
is still labeled as unoccupied, the wire sensor can electronically remove power from the
load.
[1061]       Referring to FIG. 11, wireless sensor 1110 can be at least partially disposed
within electrical enclosure 1120, and can include a processor module 1116, a radio 1162,
an antenna 1164, a button 1166, a current transformer 1172, a switch 1174, a DC/DC
converter 1176, and a regulator 1178. Electrical enclosure 1120 can include AC mains
1122, 1124. Wireless sensor 1110 can be similar to and include similar components as
wireless sensor 1010. For example, wireless sensor can include a processor module 1116
similar to processor module 1016.       Unlike wireless sensor 1010 depicted in FIG. 10,
antenna 1164 of wireless sensor 1110 is at least partially disposed outside of electrical
enclosure 1120.
[1062]       Referring to FIG. 12, wireless sensor 1210 can be at least partially disposed
within electrical enclosure 1220, and can include the energy harvester 1212, a processor
module 1216, a radio 1262, an antenna 1264, a button (not shown in FIG. 12), a current
transformer 1272, a switch 1274, a DC/DC converter 1276, and a regulator 1278.
Electrical enclosure 1220 can include AC mains 1222, 1224. Wireless sensor 1210 can
be similar to and include similar components as wireless sensor 1010.          For example,
wireless sensor 1210 can include a processor module 1216 similar to processor module
1016. Unlike wireless sensor 1010 depicted in FIG. 10, wireless sensor 1210 includes an
energy harvester 1212, which can be similar to the energy harvesters described above.
Specifically, when energy harvester 1212 is in the first configuration, for example, energy
harvest 1212 can harvest energy from the current flowing through wireless sensor 1210.
Energy harvester 1212 can transform a small portion of the current to a usable voltage.
The voltage can be rectified to DC and can be used to recharge a battery or another
storage device such as a supercapacitor. As shown in FIG. 12, energy harvester 1212 can
only harvest energy when the switch 1274is closed, connecting the line 1222 to the load
                                             18

1224. In some embodiments, energy harvester 1212 can trickle a small current through a
ground wire (not shown) which can enable the wireless sensor 1210 to harvest energy
from the line 1222 when the load 1224 is disconnected by the switch 1274.          In such
embodiments, the trickle current can be less than 6mA, specifically, less than 3mA.
[1063]      Referring to FIG. 13, wireless sensor 1310 can be at least partially disposed
within electrical enclosure 1320, and can include the energy harvester 1312, a processor
module 1316, a radio 1362, an antenna 1364, a button (not shown in FIG. 13), a current
transformer 1372, a switch 1374, a DC/DC converter 1376, and a regulator 1378.
Electrical enclosure 1320 can include AC mains 1322, 1324. Wireless sensor 1310 can
be similar to and include similar components as wireless sensor 1010.         For example,
wireless sensor 1310 can include a processor module 1316 similar to processor module
1016. Unlike wireless sensor 1010 depicted in FIG. 10, wireless sensor 1310 includes an
energy harvester 1312, which can be similar to the energy harvesters described above.
Specifically, when energy harvester 1312 is in the second configuration, for example the
energy harvester 1312 can be independent from the AC circuit. More specifically, in
some embodiments, energy harvester 1312 can be a solar cell. In such embodiments, the
solar cell can be designed to be exposed to the outside of wireless sensor 1310 through a
face plate. The face plate can be a standard design or may be custom and integrated in
the wireless sensor 1310.
[1064]      Referring to FIG. 14, wireless sensor 1410 can be at least partially disposed
within electrical enclosure 1420, and can include the energy harvester 1412, a processor
module 1416, a radio 1462, an antenna 1464, a button (not shown in FIG. 14), a current
transformer 1472, a switch 1474, a DC/DC converter 1476, and a regulator 1478.
Electrical enclosure 1420 can include AC mains 1422, 1424. Wireless sensor 1410 can
be similar to and include similar components as wireless sensor 1010.         For example,
wireless sensor can include a processor module 1416 similar to processor module 1016.
Unlike wireless sensor 1010 depicted in FIG. 10, wireless sensor 1410 includes an energy
harvester 1412, which can be similar to the energy harvesters described above.
Specifically, when energy harvester 1412 is in the third configuration, for example,
energy harvester 1412 can be designed to provide power to wireless sensor 1410
independent of a battery. In such embodiments, energy harvester 1412 and the battery
may be diode OR-ed.        In some embodiments, when the source of energy used for
                                            19

harvesting is not present (i.e. no light) a battery can be the primary source of energy to
power the wireless sensor 1410. In such embodiments, as the source of energy used for
harvesting increases, e.g., as the ambient light in a room increases, energy harvester 1412
can augment the battery.      In such embodiments, when the source of energy used for
harvesting reached a large enough value, energy harvester 1412 can be the primary source
of energy to power wireless sensor 1410.        In some embodiments, all energy may be
provided by energy harvester 1412 and no energy may be provided to the battery to
power the wireless sensor 1410.       In such embodiments, if energy harvester 1412 has
sufficient energy, it can power wireless sensor 1410 and maintain the battery energy. In
some embodiments, energy harvester 1412 can charge a supercapacitor or rechargeable
battery.
[1065]       Referring to FIG. 15, wireless sensor 1510 can be at least partially disposed
within electrical enclosure 1520, and can include the power supply 1513, a processor
module 1516, a radio 1562, an antenna 1564, a button (not shown in FIG. 15), a current
transformer 1572, a switch 1574, a DC/DC converter 1576, and a regulator 1578.
Electrical enclosure 1520 can include AC mains 1522, 1524 and neutral 1526. Wireless
sensor 1510 can be similar to and include similar components as wireless sensor 1010.
For example, wireless sensor can include a processor module 1516 similar to processor
module 1016. Unlike wireless sensor 1010 depicted in FIG. 10, wireless sensor 1510
includes a power supply 1513. Specifically, because electrical enclosure 1520 includes a
neutral line 1026, wireless sensor 1510 can receive power from, for example, building
electricity. Power supply 1513 can include an AC/DC converter.
[1066]       As described herein, with reference to FIGS. 10-15, a wireless sensor may
adjust or dim the electrical connection on the load wire via any method such as chopping
the AC input from the line wire or by a 0-1 OV signal to an external dimming device (not
shown).
[1067]       FIG. 16 is an illustration of a portion of a wireless sensor 1610 disposed
within a electrical enclosure 1620. Specifically, wireless sensor 1610 includes an antenna
1664, a faceplate 1668, a button 1666, a battery compartment door 1682 and a battery
compartment door securing device 1684.        As shown in FIG. 16, antenna 1664 can be
disposed within and/or adjacent to faceplate 1668. Battery compartment door 1682 can
provide access for installing and/or replacing a battery (not shown). Battery compartment
                                             20

door securing device 1684 secures batter compartment door 1682 in a closed position and
can include, for example, a screw or snapping mechanism. In some embodiments, button
 1666 may be implemented using capacitive touch technology using one or more sensing
locations. In some embodiments, button 1666 may give the ability to control the switch
and also dim the electrical connection between a line wire and a load wire.
 [1068]      As described herein, with reference to FIGS. 1-16, a wireless sensor can be, at
least partially disposed within an electrical enclosure, specifically a junction box, and one
or more antennas can be disposed internal, external, partially internal, or integral to the
junction box. In some embodiments, a characteristic of the junction box can determine a
positioning of an antenna. In some embodiments, the junction box can include metal or
can include plastic. In some embodiments, a faceplate associated with the junction box
and/or wireless sensor can include plastic and allow the antenna mounting within the
junction box and RF energy can exit the box through the plastic face plate when the
junction box is metal. Alternatively, when the junction box is plastic, RF energy can exit
through both the face plate and junction box. In some embodiments, the antenna can exit
the junction box to maximize performance by minimizing the influence of the metal
junction box. In some embodiments, the antenna may be cabled to the junction box or
may be panel mounted on the side or top of the junction box, a stud, or a wall.
 [1069]      In some embodiments, the antenna may use the junction box as a ground plane
or as part of the antenna's radiating structure. In some embodiments, the antenna can also
be formed by using a metal junction box and face plate and using a slot within the face
plate. By way of example, a junction box can be metal. The metal of the junction box
can prevent a standard antenna from working properly because the junction box can
shield radiation and/or detune the antenna.
 [1070]      In some embodiments, the antenna may use the junction box as a ground plane
for the antenna without a physical connection of the RF ground of the radio to the earth
ground of the junction box. Isolation between the grounds is performed using a dielectric.
The RF signal establishes a virtual ground connection using the capacitance formed
between the RF ground and earth ground through the dielectric.
 [1071]      In some embodiments, an antenna can use metal of a junction box as part of
the antenna to improve performance. In such embodiments, the antenna can use a plastic
                                              21

junction box cover. In such embodiments, the antenna structure includes a metal plane,
orthogonal metal wings, and a point fed plane. The point fed plane can be constructed on
a dielectric such as FR4 and can also have a superstrate that can cover the plane, and can
be made of a second dielectric, for example, plastic. In such embodiments, the antenna is
a hybrid between a patch antenna, an inverted-F antenna, and a dipole antenna.
Additionally, the metal plane includes orthogonal wings to ensure resonance in a multi
gang or plastic junction box. In such an embodiment, the junction box acts as half of a
dipole antenna while the point fed plane acts as the other half. The metal plane under the
point fed plane can force the current associated with an RF wave to flow on the outside of
the junction box to form a dipole type antenna (the point fed plane can be the positive
side of the dipole and the metal plane combined with the junction box metal and
orthogonal wings can be the negative side of the dipole).          In another example, the
junction box is a plastic junction box, and orthogonal wings allow the current associate
with an RF wave to flow rearwards as is the case in a metal junction box. This can allow
the resonance of the antenna to be maintained (return loss less then -7dB). Said another
way, the resonant frequency of an antenna occurs when the impedance of the antenna is
the complex conjugate for the source or load impedance. In an example, an antenna can
be designed to be 50 ohms to match the 50 impedance of the connected radio transceiver.
In such an example, return loss can be a measure of how close to 50 ohms (or other
impedance for non-50ohm systems) the antenna is. In the example, a return loss of less
than -10dB can be a good match, e.g. the antenna is resonant at that frequency or over
that frequency range. Additionally, the orthogonal wings can allow the antenna to stay in
resonance when mounted in a multi-gang metal junction box. In some embodiments, the
metal plane and metal orthogonal wings can be formed from a single piece of bent metal.
The orthogonal wings can be spaced, for example, at least 1mm from the junction box
walls. In some embodiments, the antenna can be used as part of a button in a wireless
sensor. In some embodiments, the point fed point can be used as part of the antenna and
as a capacitive touch button to eliminate the mechanical motion of the antenna.
