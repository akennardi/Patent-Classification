          STEEL CORING DRILLING MACHINE AND GREEN NEW
   CONSTRUCTION METHOD CAPABLE OF REPLACING TRENCH
                                   WELL EXPLORATION
5 TECHNICAL FIELD
  [0001] The present invention relates to the field of exploration technology, and in particular, to
  a steel coring drilling machine and a green new construction method capable of replacing trench
  well exploration.
o BACKGROUND
  [0002] Geological trench exploration is one of the most commonly used methods for
  geological exploration. The method is to use manpower or machinery to excavate a long trench
  of 0.3m which has a certain length and passes through the cover to reach the bedrock in a
  certain direction on the surface. The depth of the long trench is generally not more than 3m, the
5 width of the surface is generally measured by the depth of the trench at 1:1 of slopes, and rock
  samples are carved at the bedrock. Geological exploration or mineral anomaly inspection is then
  performed after the work such as catalog description and sample testing analysis from geology
  technicians.
  [0003] Geological shallow well exploration is also one of the more commonly used methods
0 for geological exploration. The method is to use manpower or machinery to excavate a circular
  or square shallow well on the surface and the depth is generally not more than 20m. Rock
  samples are obtained after reaching the bedrock or designing rock stratum. Geological
  exploration or mineral anomaly inspection is then performed after the work such as catalog
  description and sample testing analysis from geology technicians.
5 [0004] Geological trenches and shallow wells are often collectively referred to as trench well
  exploration. At present, the main issues in trench exploration methods are as follows.
  [0005J 1. The most important issue for construction of trench wells in forest land and
  cultivated land is the destruction of forest land and cultivated land and destruction of the
  ecological environment. Even if backfilling and restoration of vegetation are carried out
0 immediately after completion, environmental restoration will take from several years to several
  decades or longer.
  [0006J 2. In addition to the need to pay for its own construction fees, the trench well
  exploration construction needs to pay a large amount of expenses, such as land use fees, forest

  land and cultivated land occupation fees, tree young crops compensation fees, forest land and
  cultivated land recovery fees, etc., so that the exploration cost continues to increase.
  [0007] 3. There are safety risks in the construction of trench exploration. In recent years, there
  have been accidents of casualties resulted from the collapse of side slopes of trench well
5 exploration.
  [0008] 4. When shallow wells are excavated, wood frames or other measures should be used
  to support according to the conditions of the stratum. When there is groundwater, drainage is
  required. The construction process is complicated, the construction difficulty and safety risks
  are relatively large and the cost is high.
0 [0009] 5. It is difficult or impossible for the trench exploration to be constructed in areas with
  the covering layer of 3m or more, and artificial judgment is needed for entering the bedrock.
  This will result in a relatively complete residual slope or a weathered layer that is mistaken for
  the bedrock. There is an issue of sampling in a wrong location, resulting in exploration errors.
  [0010] In recent years, people have been investigating devices and methods that can replace
5 geological trench well exploration. For example, many types of shallow bedrock drills have
  been used for testing and production, but none of them can replace trench well exploration. The
  main reasons are as follows.
  [0011] 1. Because the drilling machine is basically designed as exploration having a large
  angle of 900 or more than 450, the horizontal projection of the obtained core is much smaller
0 than the vertical projection, and the effect of replacing the trench well exploration cannot be
  achieved.
  [0012] 2. The surface exploration needs to be drilled in the shallow collapsed and fractured
  stratum. Generally, a drilling machine cannot guarantee normal operation in this stratum and
  cannot guarantee the coring rate.
5 [0013] 3. The existing bedrock shallow drilling machines cannot be promoted and applied in a
  larger scale due to poor construction environment conditions, frequent site conversion, low
  efficiency, high cost and difficulty in construction.

  head 56 associated therewith (it needs to be removed if the inner tube fishing head 56 is
5 connected with the inner tube pusher 57) are fed into the inner hole of the inlet drill rod 41
  through the through-hole in the power head 24, and then the coring short drill rod 42 sleeved
  outside of the steel strand 55 and connected with the strand guide tube 53 and the drill rod joint
  54 is inserted into the inner through-hole of the power head 24 and is clamped. The interval
  between the coring short drill rod 42 and the drill rod 41 is adjusted to be about 200mm so as to
0 observe the operation condition of the steel strand 55. The operating valve 73 feeds the oil to the
  strand conveyor 52 through the operation platform 7 so that the steel strand 55 is brought into
  the hole with the inner tube fishing head 56. After the inner tube fishing head 56 reaches the
  bottom of the hole and is clamped with the mushroom head 8 of the inner tube, the inner tube
  fishing head is lifted out by the strand conveyor 52 and stops from being lifted out when the

  inner tube reaches the interval of 200 mm. The inner tube fishing head 56 and the power head
  holder 243 are released, the coring short drill rod 42 is taken out of the power head 24, and the
  inner tube is taken out manually so as to complete the coring operation of the inner tube.
  [0071] 2. The inner tube is pushed: first, the inner tube is manually fed into the inner hole of
5 the inlet drill rod 41. After being connected with a pusher, the inner tube fishing head 56
  becomes the inner tube pusher 57, and then is fed into the inner hole of the inlet drill rod 41
  through the through-hole in the power head 24 by the steel strand 55 and the inner tube fishing
  head 56 associated therewith, and then the coring short drill rod 42 sleeved outside of the steel
  strand 55 and connected with the strand guide tube 53 and the drill rod joint 54 is inserted into
0 the inner through-hole of the power head 24 and is clamped. The interval between the coring
  short drill rod 42 and the drill rod 41 is adjusted to be about 200mm so as to observe the
  operation condition of the steel strand 55. The operating valve 73 feeds the oil to the strand
  conveyor 52 through the operation platform 7 so that the steel strand 55 is brought into the hole
  with the inner tube pusher 57 to push the inner tube forward. After the inner tube pusher 57
5 reaches the bottom of the hole and pushes and clamps the inner tube into the outer tube, the
  inner tube pusher 57 is withdrawn by the strand conveyor 52 and stops when the inner tube
  pusher 57 reaches the interval of 200 mm. The power head holder 243 is released, and the

  [00781 The present invention further provides a green new construction method capable of
0 replacing trench well exploration, i.e., a construction method of horizontally drilling and
  exploring on the surface, comprising the following steps:
  [0079] Si: installing, wherein a base 1 is fixed to the ground, a main machine 2 is installed on
  the base 1, a drill rod 4 is installed on the main machine 2, a drilling tool 3 is installed on the

  front end of the drill rod 4, and the back end of the drill rod 4 is installed together with the steel
  coring system 5;
  [0080] S2: adjusting, wherein the installation angle of the main machine 2 is adjusted through
  the base 1 so that the drilling hole and the ground have an angle of 0-45O;
5 [0081] S3: drilling, wherein the main machine 2 is controlled by the power system 6 and the
  operation platform 7 to drive the drill rod 4 to cause the drilling tool 3 to rotate and advance;
  and
  [0082] S4: coring, wherein a cyclic coring operation without lifting the drill is performed by
  the steel coring system 5.
0 [00831 The operating principle of the above construction method is that drilling is performed
  in a horizontal direction through a main machine 2 of a full hydraulic coring drilling machine, a
  drill rod 4 and a double-pipe drilling tool 3 with a bit installed on the base 1 of a drilling
  machine on the surface to rotate and drill in a horizontal direction. The angle of the drilling hole
  is horizontal or a small angle (generally 0-45o). The depth may be determined according to the
5 geological design and drilling machine capacity. After entering the bedrock, the cores start to be
  continuously extracted, and then geological exploration or mineral anomaly inspection is then
  performed after the work such as catalog description and sample testing analysis from geology
  technicians.
  [0084] The features and advantages of the above exploration construction method are as
0 follows.
  [0085] 1. The problems of protection of forest land and cultivated land are fundamentally
  solved and the contradiction between environmental protection and mineral exploration at the
  current stage is solved.
  [0086J 2. A comparative study of a large number of field experiments shows that social and
5 economic benefits are very significant.
  [0087] Taking the forest area as an example, a horizontal drilling machine site of an
  exploration construction method provided by the present invention temporarily occupies an area
  of about 31m 2 and a deforestation area of about 16m 2 . Taking the horizontal drilling of 100m as
  an example, a site of 100m is drilled in one direction, and is drilled in a forward direction and a
0 reverse direction up to 200m; corresponding to trenches of 200 extended meters (the depth of
  the trench is calculated as 3m at 1:1 of slopes), the deforestation area is (200 extended meters x
  6.6 meters wide) = 1320m 2 , both sides of the trench have mound of about 5m in width and of
  about (200 extended meters x 5 meters wide x 2 sides) 20Gm 2 in occupied area. Therefore, the

  deforestation area of the exploration construction method is about 1/83 of the trench, and the
  temporarily occupied area is 1/65 of the trench, greatly reducing the deforestation area for
  exploration.
  [0088] 3. The exploration construction method of the present invention can greatly reduce a
5 large amount of expenses, land use fees, forest land and cultivated land occupation fees, tree
  young crops compensation fees, forest land and cultivated land recovery fees, etc., so that the
  actual cost of exploration is limitedly increased.
  [0089] 4. The exploration construction method of the present invention is to pass through the
  covering layer into the bedrock for construction and continuously coring, improving the
0 accuracy and effect of geological exploration. After the field is compared with the constructed
  trench, its advantages are as follows.
  [0090] (1) Horizontal drilling has obvious advantages in the division of the stratigraphic
  boundary. It can clearly and accurately divide the lithologic boundary, and can continuously and
  clearly observe the mineralized alteration and zonation of rocks.
5 [0091] (2) Horizontal drilling in the deep bedrock position can better avoid the effect of
  weathering of the surface bedrock on observing the mineralized alteration, and greatly increase
  the possibility of discovering mineralized bodies.
  [0092] (3) In areas where the residual slope of the surface layer is thicker and the bedrock
  cannot be exposed by artificial excavation or mechanical excavation, drilling and exploration in
0 the horizontal direction can more accurately determine the lithologic boundary and better
  observe the phenomenon of mineralized alteration. The possibility of losing or breaking mines
  is reduced.
  [0093] (4) For shallow geophysical and geochemical exploration anomalies on the surface,
  the existing trench exploration methods cannot achieve the geological purpose, and in the case
5 that the theoretical basis for vertical drilling is not enough, shallow geological conditions and
  shallow geophysical exploration anomalies can be verified using horizontal drilling in the early
  period, and the advantage of horizontal drilling is obvious.
  [0094] (5) For the near-vertical mineralized body that has been discovered, horizontal drilling
  can more accurately determine the horizontal width of the mineralized body and match the
0 vertical drilling to accurately obtain mineral resource reserves.
  [0095] In summary, the present invention provides a steel coring drilling machine and a green
  new construction method capable of replacing trench well exploration. Its main features and
  technical breakthroughs are as follows.

  [0096] 1. The development of the steel coring drilling machine in which drilling of trench
  well exploration in the horizontal direction on the surface is replaced with drilling has filled the
  gap in the field of the coring drill in the horizontal direction on the surface in China.
  [0097] 2. The steel coring drilling machine in which drilling of trench well exploration in the
5 horizontal direction on the surface is replaced with drilling has basically achieved the light,
  applicable, efficient and appropriately moderate technical and economical parameters and
  indicators having some functions so as to basically achieve the promotion and use requirements
  in terms of efficiency, cost and quality.
  [0098] 3. The main features of the base design of the steel coring drilling machine in which
0 drilling of trench well exploration in the horizontal direction on the surface is replaced with
  drilling are as follows.
  [0099] (1) The base of the drilling machine basically consists of five sleepers, two drilling
  machine base steel beams, a front set of and a back set of angle-adjustable drilling machine
  supporting frames, and four fixed steel chisels. The structure is simple, firm and reliable.
5 [001001        (2) The drilling machine base 1 on one site can realize four-way porous drilling,
  which can reduce the occupied area, reduce the number of relocations, increase the efficiency
  and reduce the cost, and can also meet the needs of obtaining the occurrence of the geological
  rock stratum.
  [00101]        The same-direction porous drilling is performed in such a way that the base steel
0 beam is translated by 0.5-im on the base sleeper and the drilling angle can be changed. The
  stratum occurrence of the geological rock stratum is obtained through the change of the depth
  and position of the rock marker layer. Reverse drilling is accomplished by turning around the
  drilling machine through the base steel beam.
  [00102]        (3) Stabilization of drilling machines is the basic condition for ensuring normal
5 drilling of drilling machines. The base adopts a drilling machine stabilizing system in which
  "the base 1 is embedded in the ground and driven into the steel chisel for reinforcement",
  basically meeting the construction requirements. There are no problems such as sinking,
  displacement, and tilting.
  [001031        4. The main features and technical breakthroughs of the steel coring system
0 [00104]        (1) In order to ensure that the coring of the stratum is not disturbed, the coring
  accuracy is increased, and the core volume and the coring rate are guaranteed, drilling in the
  horizontal direction on the surface should give priority to the current most common drilling
  process method, i.e., rope coring drilling.

  [00105]       Rope coring is widely used due to its high efficiency, low cost, high coring rate,
  low bending rate of drilling holes, and low labor intensity of workers, but the normal rope
  coring is put into the inner tube by its own weight, and the rope winch 51 takes out the inner
  tube and the core through a steel wire rope and a fisher. The drilling angle is generally required
5 to be greater than 450 to be used, so the rope coring cannot be performed when the surface is
  drilled at 0-45'. If the inner tube is further advanced and extracted by an adapter tube, the sense
  of rope coring is lost to some extent. The horizontal drilling of the bedrock is constructed on the
  shallow layer of the collapsed and broken surface. A general drilling method cannot guarantee
  the coring rate. The main breakthrough of this system is to replace the steel wire rope with a
o steel strand 55 for coring, which fundamentally solves the obstacle that the rope drilling cannot
  be used for the drilling at 0-45'. The steel coring steel strand 55 has some strength in addition to
  the bendability, which can complete the work of fishing and advancing the coring tube.
  [00106]       (2) The steel coring system greatly reduces the frequency of lifting the drill. A hole
  having a depth of 100m has a basic number of lifting the drill of about 1-3 times, so that the
5 borehole wall is more stable. The collapsed stratum can shorten the roundtrip meterage and
  guarantee the coring rate, and has truly achieved the effects of high automation, high efficiency,
  high accuracy, low cost, easy operation, and easy maintenance.
  [00107]       The above description is only the specific embodiment of the present invention,
  but the scope of protection of the present invention is not limited thereto. Any changes or the
0 replacements conceivable to those skilled in the art within the technical scope disclosed by the
  present invention should fall within the scope of protection of the present invention. Therefore,
  the scope of protection of the present invention shall be subject to the scope of protection of the
  claims.
