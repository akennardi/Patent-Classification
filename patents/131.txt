   Description of the Background Art
            For example, Japanese Patent Laying-Open No. 2015-68555 has been known as
   a conventional combustion apparatus.
25          Japanese Patent Laying-Open No. 2015-68555 discloses a combustion
   apparatus of a normal combustion type in which a fan is provided below a burner case.
   In this combustion apparatus, a tip end portion of the fan on a side of an emission port
   is attached to a bottom portion of the burner case with a screw. The fan case is attached
                                               -1-

   to the burner case by screwing the screw from both of a front side and a rear side of the
   fan case.
   SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
 5         Normally, in assembling a combustion apparatus, a burner case is assembled in
   a housing of a combustion apparatus and thereafter a fan case is attached to the burner
   case. In assembly of the combustion apparatus, according to the publication, the screw
   should be screwed from both of the front side and the rear side of the fan case.
   Therefore, an operation for screwing is required on both of the front side and the rear
10 side of the housing of the combustion apparatus and an assembly operation is
   complicated.
            Since an operation on both of the front side and the rear side of the housing of
   the combustion apparatus is required also in a maintenance work for replacement of a
   fan, the maintenance work is also complicated.
15         An orientation of the fan case placed in the housing may be changed in order to
   permit an operation to assemble the combustion apparatus on only one of the front side
   and the rear side of the combustion apparatus. In this case, however, the housing for
   accommodating the fan case may increase in size and the combustion apparatus may
   increase in size.
20         It is therefore desirable to provide a combustion apparatus of which assembly
   and maintenance are facilitated and of which increase in size can be suppressed and a
   method of manufacturing the same.
           A combustion apparatus according to the present invention includes a housing,
   a chamber, and a fan. The housing includes a back plate portion, a pair of side plate
25 portions which extend forward from both side ends of the back plate portion and a front
   opening. The chamber is arranged inside the housing and includes a first attachment
   surface inclined with respect to the back plate portion in a plan view and an intake port
   which opens forward in the first attachment surface. The fan includes a second
   attachment surface provided with an emission port and is attached to the chamber in a
                                                -2-

   state in which the second attachment surface is opposed to the first attachment surface
   to communicate the emission port with the intake port of the chamber.
            According to the combustion apparatus in the present invention, the chamber is
   attached to the housing by being inserted into the housing through the front opening of
 5 the housing. With the chamber being attached to the housing, the intake port of the
   chamber opens forward in the first attachment surface. Therefore, the emission port of
   the fan can communicate with the intake port of the chamber by inserting the fan
   through the front opening of the housing. Therefore, in assembling the combustion
   apparatus, the combustion apparatus can be assembled by inserting both of the chamber
10 and the fan through the front opening of the housing. Since the necessity for an
   operation for assembly on a rear side of the housing is thus obviated, the assembly
   operation is facilitated.
            In maintenance as well, maintenance can be done simply by performing works
   from the front of the housing. Therefore, a maintenance work is also facilitated.
15          The intake port of the chamber opens forward in the first attachment surface.
   Therefore, mixture gas from the fan can be fed to the chamber diagonally rearward
   from diagonal front. A long length of a path for the mixture gas can thus readily be
   secured also in a small-sized combustion apparatus and the gas is well mixed.
   Therefore, it is not necessary to increase a size of the housing for better mixing of the
20 gas. Therefore, increase in size of the combustion apparatus can be suppressed.
            A combustion apparatus of which assembly and maintenance are facilitated and
   of which increase in size can be suppressed can thus be obtained.
            In the combustion apparatus, the chamber includes a first attachment portion
   including the first attachment surface and an engagement portion having an opposing
25 portion which is opposed to the first attachment portion with a gap lying therebetween.
   The fan includes a second attachment portion including the second attachment surface
   and an insertion portion connected to the second attachment portion and inserted in
   between the first attachment portion and the opposing portion while the chamber and
   the fan are fixed to each other.
                                               -3 -

            By thus inserting the insertion portion in between the first attachment portion
   and the engagement portion, the insertion portion can be engaged with both of the first
   attachment portion and the engagement portion. Thus, the fan can be held by the
   chamber as being caught thereby before the fan is fixed to the chamber. Therefore,
 5 drop of the fan from the chamber during an operation to fix the fan to the chamber can
   be suppressed. Therefore, an operation to fix the fan to the chamber is facilitated.
            In the combustion apparatus, the first attachment portion includes an inclined
   surface which continues to the first attachment surface. A portion of joint between the
   first attachment surface and the inclined surface forms a projecting corner portion in the
10 plan view. The insertion portion is opposed to the corner portion with a gap lying
   therebetween in the plan view.
            With the inclined surface, an area where the first attachment surface and the
   second attachment surface are opposed to each other can be decreased. Therefore, a
   high surface pressure between the first attachment surface and the second attachment
15 surface can be secured. Therefore, sealability between the first attachment surface and
   the second attachment surface is improved.
            When the portion of joint between the first attachment surface and the inclined
   surface forms a projecting corner portion in the plan view, burr is likely in the comer
   portion. In the plan view, however, the insertion portion is opposed to the comer
20 portion with a gap lying therebetween. Therefore, the burr does not impair sealability
   between the first attachment surface and the second attachment surface.
            In the combustion apparatus, the chamber further includes a reinforcement
   portion which connects the opposing portion and the first attachment portion to each
   other at a root of the engagement portion.
25          The reinforcement portion reinforces the engagement portion. Therefore, even
   when a weight of the fan is applied to the engagement portion due to engagement of the
   insertion portion with the engagement portion, break or bending of the engagement
   portion can be suppressed.
                                                -4-

           In the combustion apparatus, the second attachment portion includes a first side
   end portion located laterally to the emission port and a second side end portion while
   the emission port lies therebetween. The first side end portion is located closer to a
   position of a center of gravity of the fan than the second side end portion in the plan
 5 view. The insertion portion is provided in the first side end portion.
           Since the insertion portion is provided in the first side end portion close to the
   position of the center of gravity, the fan is well balanced when the insertion portion is
   engaged with the engagement portion. An operation to attach the fan to the chamber is
   thus further facilitated.
10         The combustion apparatus further includes a fixing member which fixes the
   chamber and the fan to each other while the first attachment surface and the second
   attachment surface are opposed to each other.
           The intake port of the chamber opens forward in the first attachment surface.
   Therefore, the fixing member inserted into the housing through the front opening of the
15 housing can fix the chamber and the fan to each other. An operation to fix the chamber
   and the fan to each other with the fixing member can thus also be performed from the
   front of the housing and attachment and maintenance are facilitated.
           In the combustion apparatus, the fixing member includes at least a first screw
   member and a second screw member. The chamber includes a first screw hole in
20 which the first screw member is inserted and a second screw hole in which the second
   screw member is inserted. Both of the first screw hole and the second screw hole are
   arranged at positions higher than the intake port and the first screw hole is arranged at a
   position higher than the second screw hole with respect to the intake port.
           The first screw hole is arranged at a high position. Therefore, even when a
25 motor or the like is attached above the fan, the fixing member can be attached while
   avoiding the motor. The second screw hole is arranged at a position lower than the first
   screw hole, that is, a position close to the intake port. Therefore, the first attachment
   surface provided with the intake port and the second attachment surface provided with
   the emission port can more reliably be sealed.
                                                -5 -

            A method of manufacturing a combustion apparatus according to the present
   invention includes steps below.
            A housing including a back plate portion, a pair of side plate portions which
   extend forward from both side ends of the back plate portion and a front opening is
 5 prepared. A chamber including a first attachment surface provided with an intake port
   is inserted through the opening into the inside of the housing and attached to the
   housing such that the first attachment surface is inclined with respect to the back plate
   portion in a plan view and the intake port opens forward in the first attachment surface.
   A fan including a second attachment surface provided with an emission port is inserted
10 through the opening into the inside of the housing and fixed to the chamber with the
   second attachment surface being opposed to the first attachment surface for
   communication of the emission port with the intake port of the chamber.
            According to the method of manufacturing a combustion apparatus of the
   present invention, the chamber is attached to the housing by being inserted into the
15 housing through the front opening of the housing. With the chamber being attached to
   the housing, the intake port of the chamber opens forward in the first attachment
   surface. Therefore, the emission port of the fan can communicate with the intake port
   of the chamber by inserting the fan through the front opening of the housing.
   Therefore, in assembling the combustion apparatus, the combustion apparatus can be
20 assembled by inserting both of the chamber and the fan through the front opening of the
   housing. Since the necessity for an operation for assembly on the rear side of the
   housing is thus obviated, the assembly operation is facilitated.
            In maintenance as well, maintenance can be done simply by performing works
   from the front of the housing. Therefore, a maintenance work is also facilitated.
25          The intake port of the chamber opens forward in the first attachment surface.
   Therefore, mixture gas from the fan can be fed to the chamber diagonally rearward
   from diagonal front. A long length of a path for the mixture gas can thus readily be
   secured also in a small-sized combustion apparatus and the gas is well mixed.
                                              -6-

   Therefore, it is not necessary to increase a size of the housing for better mixing of the
   gas. Therefore, increase in size of the combustion apparatus can be suppressed.
           A combustion apparatus of which assembly and maintenance are facilitated and
   of which increase in size can be suppressed can thus be obtained.
 5         In the method of manufacturing a combustion apparatus, the chamber is
   prepared to include a first attachment portion including the first attachment surface and
   an engagement portion having an opposing portion which is opposed to the first
   attachment portion with a gap lying therebetween. The fan is prepared to include a
   second attachment portion including the second attachment surface and an insertion
10 portion provided in the second attachment portion. The insertion portion of the fan is
   inserted in between the first attachment portion and the opposing portion of the
   chamber after the fan is inserted into the inside of the housing through the front
   opening and before the fan is fixed to the chamber.
           As the insertion portion is thus inserted in between the first attachment portion
15 and the opposing portion, the insertion portion can be engaged with both of the first
   attachment portion and the engagement portion. Thus, the fan can be held by the
   chamber as being caught thereby before the fan is fixed to the chamber. Therefore,
   drop of the fan from the chamber during an operation to fix the fan to the chamber can
   be suppressed. Therefore, an operation to fix the fan to the chamber is facilitated.
20         In the method of manufacturing a combustion apparatus, after the insertion
   portion is inserted in between the first attachment portion and the engagement portion,
   a fixing member inserted into the inside of the housing through the front opening fixes
   the chamber and the fan to each other.
           The intake port of the chamber opens diagonally forward in the first attachment
25 surface. Therefore, the fixing member inserted into the housing through the front
   opening of the housing can fix the chamber and the fan to each other. An operation to
   fix the chamber and the fan to each other with the fixing member can also be performed
   from the front of the housing and attachment and maintenance are facilitated.
                                                -7-

   DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
            An embodiment of the present invention will be described below with reference
   to the drawings.
            A construction of a combustion apparatus in one embodiment of the present
 5 invention will initially be described with reference to Fig. 1. A plan view in the
   description below means a point of view in a direction orthogonal to an upper surface
   of a flat plate portion 31 a of a chamber 31 or a point of view in a direction orthogonal
   to an upper surface of a top plate portion 50d of a housing 50.
            As shown in Fig. 1, a combustion apparatus 100 in the present embodiment
10 mainly includes a sensible heat recovery heat exchanger (primary heat exchanger) 10, a
   latent heat recovery heat exchanger (secondary heat exchanger) 20, a burner 30, a
   chamber 31, a fan (fan assembly) 32, a duct 33, a venturi 34, an orifice 35, a gas valve
   36, a pipe 40, a bypass pipe 41, a three-way valve 42, a liquid to liquid heat exchanger
   43, a hydronic pipe 44, and a housing 50. All of components except for housing 50
15 among the components above are arranged in housing 50.
            Gas valve 36, orifice 35, and venturi 34 are connected to the pipe in this order.
   Fuel gas can be supplied from the outside of housing 50 to this pipe. The fuel gas
   supplied to this pipe flows to venturi 34 through gas valve 36 and orifice 35.
            Gas valve 36 is configured to control a flow rate of the fuel gas. Venturi 34 is
20 configured to increase a flow velocity of mixture gas by reducing the flow of the
   mixture gas of the fuel gas and air. Venturi 34 is constructed to take in air from the
   outside of housing 50. Venturi 34 is constructed to mix air taken in from the outside of
   housing 50 and the fuel gas supplied through the pipe.
            Venturi 34 is connected to fan 32 through the pipe. The mixture gas mixed in
25 venturi 34 is sent through this pipe to fan 32. Fan 32 is configured to supply the
   mixture gas to burner 30. Fan 32 mainly includes a fan case, an impeller arranged in
   the fan case, and a drive source (such as a motor) for rotating the impeller.
            Fan 32 is connected to chamber 31 and chamber 31 is connected to burner 30.
   The mixture gas sent from fan 32 is sent through chamber 31 to burner 30.
                                               -9-

           Burner 30 is configured to generate combustion gas as heating gas by burning
   the mixture gas. Burner 30 is an inverse combustion type apparatus which supplies
   combustion gas downward. The mixture gas issued from burner 30 is ignited by an
   ignition plug 14 and becomes the combustion gas. Ignition plug 14 is provided, for
 5 example, in sensible heat recovery heat exchanger 10.
           Burner 30, sensible heat recovery heat exchanger 10, and latent heat recovery
   heat exchanger 20 are connected such that the combustion gas sequentially passes
   through sensible heat recovery heat exchanger 10 and latent heat recovery heat
   exchanger 20. Specifically, sensible heat recovery heat exchanger 10 is attached under
10 burner 30 and latent heat recovery heat exchanger 20 is attached under sensible heat
   recovery heat exchanger 10.
           Duct 33 is connected to latent heat recovery heat exchanger 20 and duct 33
   extends to the outside of housing 50. The combustion gas which has passed through
   latent heat recovery heat exchanger 20 is thus emitted to the outside of housing 50
15 through duct 33.
           Each of sensible heat recovery heat exchanger 10 and latent heat recovery heat
   exchanger 20 is configured to heat water and/or hot water by exchanging heat between
   the combustion gas supplied from burner 30 and water and/or hot water.
           Sensible heat recovery heat exchanger 10 is configured to recover sensible heat
20 of the combustion gas generated by burner 30. Latent heat recovery heat exchanger 20
   is configured to recover latent heat of the combustion gas. For example, a plate type
   heat exchanger is employed as latent heat recovery heat exchanger 20.
           When a temperature of incoming water and/or hot water is low in sensible heat
   recovery heat exchanger 10 or when an amount of heating by burner 30 is small, water
25 vapor in the combustion gas is condensed in sensible heat recovery heat exchanger 10
   and condensed water (drainage water) is generated. Drainage water is generated also in
   latent heat recovery heat exchanger 20. Drainage water is drained to the outside of
   housing 50 through a part of duct 33.
                                               - 10 -

            A heat transfer tube of sensible heat recovery heat exchanger 10 and a heat
   transfer portion of latent heat recovery heat exchanger 20 are connected to each other
   through pipe 40. A part of pipe 40 on a water entry side relative to latent heat recovery
   heat exchanger 20 and a part of pipe 40 on a hot water exit side relative to sensible heat
 5 recovery heat exchanger 10 are bypassed by bypass pipe 41.
            The part of pipe 40 on the hot water exit side relative to sensible heat recovery
   heat exchanger 10 and bypass pipe 41 are connected to each other by three-way valve
   42. Three-way valve 42 is constructed to be able to switch between a flow path from
   sensible heat recovery heat exchanger 10 to a hot water outlet of pipe 40 and a flow
10 path from sensible heat recovery heat exchanger 10 to bypass pipe 41.
            Liquid to liquid heat exchanger 43 is connected to bypass pipe 41. Hydronic
   pipe 44 connected to a hydronic terminal is inserted in liquid to liquid heat exchanger
   43. Liquid to liquid heat exchanger 43 is constructed such that warm water warmed as
   a result of passage through sensible heat recovery heat exchanger 10 and latent heat
15 recovery heat exchanger 20 flows in liquid to liquid heat exchanger 43. As warm water
   which flows in liquid to liquid heat exchanger 43 flows outside hydronic pipe 44, heat
   can be exchanged between warm water which flows in liquid to liquid heat exchanger
   43 and warm water which flows in hydronic pipe 44.
            Water supplied to combustion apparatus 100 becomes hot as a result of heat
20 exchange with the combustion gas in sensible heat recovery heat exchanger 10 and
   latent heat recovery heat exchanger 20. Hot water can thus be supplied by combustion
   apparatus 100.
            Warm water which returns from the hydronic terminal passes through hydronic
   pipe 44 to be warmed as a result of heat exchange with warm water warmed by sensible
25 heat recovery heat exchanger 10 and latent heat recovery heat exchanger 20 in liquid to
   liquid heat exchanger 43 and thereafter it is supplied again to the hydronic terminal.
   Warm water can thus be supplied to the hydronic terminal by combustion apparatus
   100.
                                               - 11 -

            A construction of housing 50, chamber 31, and fan 32 included in combustion
   apparatus 100 will now be described with reference to Figs. 2 to 4.
            As shown in Fig. 2, housing 50 includes a back plate portion 50a, a pair of side
   plate portions 50b and 50c, a top plate portion 50d, and a bottom plate portion 50e.
 5 The pair of side plate portions 50b and 50c extend forward from both side ends of back
   plate portion 50a. Top plate portion 50d extends forward from an upper end of back
   plate portion 50a. Bottom plate portion 50e extends forward from a lower end of back
   plate portion 50a.
            The pair of side plate portions 50b and 50c are connected to top plate portion
10 50d and bottom plate portion 50e to form a frame. A front opening is thus provided in
   housing 50. The front opening is closed by a not-shown front lid member after each
   component is accommodated as being assembled in the inside of housing 50.
            As described above, sensible heat recovery heat exchanger 10, latent heat
   recovery heat exchanger 20, burner 30, chamber 31, fan 32, and venturi 34 are arranged
15 inside housing 50. Chamber 31 is arranged, for example, on burner 30. Burner 30 is
   arranged, for example, on sensible heat recovery heat exchanger 10 and sensible heat
   recovery heat exchanger 10 is arranged, for example, on latent heat recovery heat
   exchanger 20.
            Fan 32 is arranged, for example, laterally to chamber 31. Venturi 34 is
20 arranged, for example, under fan 32. Fan 32 and venturi 34 are connected to each other
   through an elbow pipe 34a.
            As shown in Fig. 3, chamber 31 includes a flat plate portion 31a and a first
   attachment portion 3 lb. An outer periphery of flat plate portion 3 1a in the plan view is
   substantially rectangular. First attachment portion 3 lb is located substantially in a
25 central portion of flat plate portion 31 a and projects upward from flat plate portion 31 a.
   Flat plate portion 3 1a surrounds first attachment portion 3 1b in the plan view.
            First attachment portion 3 lb includes a first attachment surface 3 1ba. First
   attachment surface 3 1ba is erected substantially perpendicularly to an upper surface of
   flat plate portion 31a. First attachment surface 31ba is inclined with respect to both of
                                                - 12 -

   one side 31 aa defining the rectangular shape of flat plate portion 31 a and the other side
   31 ab intersecting with one side 31 aa in the plan view.
            An intake port 31d is provided in first attachment surface 31ba. Intake port 31d
   is an opening for supplying mixture gas supplied from fan 32 toward burner 30. Intake
 5 port 3 1d is substantially rectangular in first attachment surface 3 1ba.
            A plurality of (for example, four) screw holes 31 e (fixing member attachment
   portions) are provided in first attachment surface 31ba. Each of four screw holes 31e
   has a female screw portion. Four screw holes 31 e are arranged in the vicinity of four
   respective corner portions of rectangular intake port 31 d.
10          Two screw holes 31 e of four screw holes 31 e are located under intake port 31 d
   (on a side of flat plate portion 31a). Other two screw holes 31e of four screw holes 31e
   are located above intake port 3 1d (opposite to flat plate portion 3 1a).
            One screw hole 31e (a first screw hole) of two screw holes 31e located above
   intake port 31 d is arranged at a position higher than the other screw hole 31 e (a second
15 screw hole) with respect to intake port 31 d. Specifically, a height HI of one screw hole
   31 e from an upper end of intake port 31 d is greater than a height H2 of the other screw
   hole 31 e from the upper end of intake port 31 d.
            First attachment portion 3 lb includes an inclined surface 3 1bb. Inclined surface
   31bb continues to one end portion of first attachment surface 31ba. A portion ofjoint
20 3 1bc between inclined surface 3 1bb and first attachment surface 3 1ba forms a
   projecting corner portion in the plan view. An angle formed between inclined surface
   3 1bb and first attachment surface 3 1ba in the plan view (that is, an angle of corner
   portion 31bc) is smaller than 1800.
            Chamber 31 includes an engagement portion 3 1c. Engagement portion 3 1c
25 includes an opposing portion 3 Ica and a connection portion 3 1cb. Opposing portion
   3 Ica is opposed to first attachment portion 3 1b with a gap lying therebetween.
   Opposing portion 3 Ica is opposed to inclined surface 3 1bb with a gap lying
   therebetween. Connection portion 31 cb connects opposing portion 31 ca and inclined
                                                - 13  -

   surface 31bb to each other. Opposing portion 3 Ica and connection portion 3 1cb are
   connected to each other to form substantially an L shape in the plan view.
           A reinforcement portion 31 f is provided at a root portion of engagement portion
   31c. Reinforcement portion 31f projects upward from a surface where engagement
 5 portion 31 c is provided. Reinforcement portion 31 f connects first attachment portion
   31b and opposing portion 31ca to each other.
           As shown in Fig. 4, fan 32 includes a fan case 32a, a motor 32b, and an impeller
   (not shown). The impeller is rotatably arranged in the inside of fan case 32a. Motor
   32b is attached to an upper portion of fan case 32a. Motor 32b provides driving force
10 for rotation to the impeller in fan case 32a.
           Fan case 32a includes a second attachment portion 32c. Second attachment
   portion 32c includes a second attachment surface 32ca. An emission port 32d is
   provided in second attachment surface 32ca. Emission port 32d communicates with an
   internal space in fan case 32a where the impeller is arranged.
15         Emission port 32d is an opening for emission of mixture gas mixed in venturi
   34 from fan 32 toward chamber 31 owing to rotation of the impeller. Emission port
   32d is substantially rectangular in second attachment surface 32ca.
           A plurality of (for example, four) through holes 32e (fixing member insertion
   portions) are provided in second attachment surface 32ca. Four through holes 32e are
20 arranged in the vicinity of four respective corner portions of rectangular emission port
   32d.
           Two through holes 32e of four through holes 32e are located under emission
   port 32d. Other two through holes 32e of four through holes 32e are located above
   emission port 32d.
25         One through hole 32e (a first through hole) of two through holes 32e located
   above emission port 32d is arranged at a position higher than the other through hole 32e
   (a second through hole) with respect to emission port 32d. Specifically, a height H3 of
   one through hole 32e from an upper end of emission port 32d is greater than a height
   H4 of the other through hole 32e from the upper end of emission port 32d.
                                               - 14 -

            One through hole 32e is arranged at a position higher than a highest portion of
   the upper surface of fan case 32a. The other through hole 32e is arranged at a position
   lower than the highest portion of the upper surface of fan case 32a.
            Fan case 32a includes an insertion portion 32f. Insertion portion 32f is
 5 connected to second attachment portion 32c and projects laterally from second
   attachment portion 32c. Second attachment portion 32c is arranged at a position which
   retracts toward motor 32b relative to second attachment surface 32ca of second
   attachment portion 32c.
            A cut portion 32h is provided in a central portion of a lower end of second
10 attachment portion 32c. Opposing end portions of the lower end of second attachment
   portion 32c where no cut portion 32h is provided extend downward as being lower than
   the central portion where cut portion 32h is provided.
            Second attachment portion 32c includes a first side end portion 32cb located
   laterally to emission port 32d and a second side end portion 32cc with emission port
15 32d lying therebetween.
            A state that chamber 31 and fan 32 are fixed will now be described with
   reference to Figs. 5 to 9.
            As shown in Fig. 5, chamber 31 and fan 32 are fixed by a fixing member 37
   with first attachment surface 3 1ba (Fig. 3) of chamber 31 and second attachment
20 surface 32ca (Fig. 4) of fan 32 being opposed to each other. For example, a screw is
   employed for fixing member 37, however, a pin may be employed.
            Fixing member 37 passes through through hole 32e in fan 32 and is screwed
   into the female screw portion of screw hole 31e of chamber 31. Fan 32 is thus fixed to
   chamber 31.
25          As shown in Fig. 6, with fan 32 being fixed to chamber 31, emission port 32d
   (Fig. 4) of fan 32 communicates with intake port 31d (Fig. 3) of chamber 31. In this
   fixed state, a sealing member (not shown) is arranged between first attachment surface
   3 1ba and second attachment surface 32ca of fan 32. This sealing member is arranged
                                               - 15 -

   to surround emission port 32d and intake port 31 d. The sealing member prevents the
   mixture gas from leaking from emission port 32d and intake port 31 d.
            As shown in Figs. 6 and 7, in the fixed state, insertion portion 32f of fan 32 is
   inserted in a gap between opposing portion 31 ca of engagement portion 31 c and first
 5 attachment portion 3 1b.
            In this fixed state, insertion portion 32f is located away from first attachment
   portion 3 lb relative to second attachment surface 32ca. Insertion portion 32f is thus
   opposed to the comer portion formed in portion of joint 3 1bc (Fig. 7) between first
   attachment surface 3 1ba of chamber 31 and inclined surface 3 1bb, with a gap lying
10 therebetween.
            As shown in Figs. 7 and 8, in the fixed state, insertion portion 32f is arranged to
   avoid reinforcement portion 31 f of chamber 31. Specifically, insertion portion 32f does
   not extend as far as reinforcement portion 31 f and there is a gap between the insertion
   portion and reinforcement portion 31f. Insertion portion 32f may ride over an upper
15 surface of reinforcement portion 31f in the fixed state.
            As shown in Fig. 9, chamber 31 and fan 32 are arranged inside housing 50.
   Inside of housing 50 refers to a space surrounded by back plate portion 50a, the pair of
   side plate portions 50b and 50c, top plate portion 50d, bottom plate portion 50e, and the
   front lid member (not shown) described above of housing 50. Fig. 9 shows a dashed
20 line A instead of the front lid member for the sake of brevity.
            With chamber 31 and fan 32 being arranged inside housing 50, first attachment
   surface 3 1ba of chamber 31 is inclined with respect to back plate portion 50a in the
   plan view. Specifically, in the plan view, a virtual extension B of first attachment
   surface 3 1ba intersects with back plate portion 50a at an angle 0 which is greater than
25 0' and smaller than 900. More preferably, such an angle that a line which is an
   extension of a central axis of through hole 32e on a side of first side end portion 32cb
   (a chain dotted line close to first side end portion 32cb in Fig. 11) does not intersect
   with a front end portion of side plate portion 50b of housing 50 in the plan view is
   desirable.
                                                 - 16 -

            Intake port 3 1d provided in first attachment surface 31ba thus opens diagonally
   forward (in a direction shown with an arrow C in the figure) in first attachment surface
   3 1ba in the plan view. Emission port 32d provided in second attachment surface 32ca
   opens diagonally rearward (a direction shown with an arrow D in the figure) in second
 5 attachment surface 32ca in the plan view.
            As described above, second attachment portion 32c includes first side end
   portion 32cb located laterally to emission port 32d and second side end portion 32cc
   with emission port 32d lying therebetween. In the plan view, first side end portion
   32cb is located closer to a position of a center of gravity G of fan 32 than second side
10 end portion 32cc. Insertion portion 32f is provided in first side end portion 32cb.
            For the sake of brevity of illustration, Fig. 9 shows the position of center of
   gravity G of fan 32 at the center of rotation of motor 32b, however, the position of
   center of gravity G is not necessarily located at the center of rotation of motor 32b.
   Whichever portion of fan 32 the position of center of gravity G of fan 32 may be
15 located in the plan view, insertion portion 32f is preferably arranged in a side end
   portion of two side end portions 32cb and 32cc of second attachment portion 32c,
   which is closer to the position of center of gravity G.
            In the plan view, engagement portion 31 c is preferably arranged at a position
   closer to back plate portion 50a than intake port 31d. A gap between opposing portion
20 31 ca of engagement portion 31 c and first attachment portion 3 lb preferably opens
   diagonally forward in a direction of extension of first attachment surface 31 ba in the
   plan view.
            One screw hole 31 e arranged at the higher position with respect to intake port
   31 d, of two screw holes 31 e arranged above intake port 31 d described with reference to
25 Fig. 3, is preferably arranged at a position closer to back plate portion 50a than the
   other screw hole 31 e arranged at the position lower with respect to intake port 31 d.
            A method of manufacturing a combustion apparatus will now be described with
   reference to Figs. 10 to 13.
                                                 - 17 -

            As shown in Fig. 10, housing 50 as described above is initially prepared.
   Specifically, housing 50 including back plate portion 50a, the pair of side plate portions
   50b and 50c, top plate portion 50d, and bottom plate portion 50e and including the front
   opening is prepared.
 5          The pair of side plate portions 50b and 50c extend forward from both side ends
   of back plate portion 50a. Top plate portion 50d extends forward from the upper end of
   back plate portion 50a. Bottom plate portion 50e extends forward from the lower end
   of back plate portion 50a. The pair of side plate portions 50b and 50c are connected to
   top plate portion 50d and bottom plate portion 50e to form a frame. The front opening
10 is thus provided in housing 50.
            Chamber 31 as described above is prepared. Specifically, chamber 31 including
   flat plate portion 3 la, first attachment portion 3 1b, and engagement portion 3 Ic is
   prepared. First attachment portion 31b includes first attachment surface 31ba provided
   with intake port 31 d. Engagement portion 31 c is arranged laterally to first attachment
15 surface 31ba. Engagement portion 3 Ic includes opposing portion 3 Ica opposed to first
   attachment portion 3 lb.
            Fan 32 as described above is prepared. Specifically, fan 32 including fan case
   32a, motor 32b, and the impeller is prepared. Fan case 32a includes second attachment
   portion 32c. Second attachment portion 32c includes second attachment surface 32ca
20 provided with emission port 32d. Insertion portion 32f is provided in second
   attachment portion 32c as projecting from second attachment portion 32c. Venturi 34
   is attached to fan 32 with elbow pipe 34a being interposed.
            Then, chamber 31 connected to burner 30 and sensible heat recovery heat
   exchanger 10 is inserted into the inside of housing 50 through the front opening of
25 housing 50. Thereafter, chamber 31 is attached and fixed to housing 50. Chamber 31
   is fixed to housing 50 such that first attachment surface 3 1ba of chamber 31 is inclined
   with respect to back plate portion 5Oa and intake port 3 1d opens diagonally forward in
   first attachment surface 3 1ba in the plan view.
                                                - 18 -

            Chamber 31 is attached and fixed to housing 50, for example, with an
   attachment member 61 being interposed.
            Then, fan 32 to which venturi 34 is attached is inserted into the inside of
   housing 50 through the front opening of housing 50. Thereafter, fan 32 is arranged
 5 with respect to chamber 31 such that second attachment surface 32ca of fan 32 is
   opposed to first attachment surface 3 1ba of chamber 31. Insertion portion 32f of fan 32
   is inserted in a gap between engagement portion 3 1c and first attachment portion 3 1b of
   chamber 31.
            As shown in Fig. 12, with insertion portion 32f being inserted in between
10 engagement portion 3 1c and first attachment portion 3 1b, fan 32 and venturi 34 tend to
   drop due to a self weight of fan 32 and venturi 34. As insertion portion 32f is inclined
   with respect to chamber 31, it is engaged with (abuts on) each of engagement portion
   3 1c and first attachment portion 3lb. Fan 32 is thus caught by chamber 31 so that fan
   32 and venturi 34 are prevented from dropping.
15          As shown in Fig. 11, thereafter, fan 32 is attached and fixed to chamber 31. Fan
   32 is fixed to chamber 31 with second attachment surface 32ca being opposed to first
   attachment surface 3 1ba for communication of emission port 32d of fan 32 with intake
   port 31d of chamber 31.
            Fixing is achieved by fixing member 37 (for example, a screw member) inserted
20 into the inside of housing 50 through the front opening of housing 50. Specifically,
   fixing member 37 passes through through hole 32e (Fig. 4) of fan 32 and is fixed (for
   example, screwed) to screw hole 31e (Fig. 3) of chamber 31. A state shown in Fig. 9 in
   the plan view and in Fig. 13 in a front view is thus achieved. Since such an angle that
   the line which is the extension of the central axis of through hole 32e on the side of first
25 side end portion 32cb (the chain dotted line close to first side end portion 32cb in Fig.
   11) does not intersect with the front end portion of side plate portion 50b is set, side
   plate portions 50b and 50c do not interfere with screwing of fixing member 37.
                                               - 19 -

            Thereafter, combustion apparatus 100 in the present embodiment is
   manufactured by assembling other members such as a pipe in housing 50 and attaching
   the front lid member to housing 50.
            A function and effect of the present embodiment will now be described.
 5          According to the present embodiment, chamber 31 is attached to housing 50 by
   being inserted into housing 50 through the front opening of housing 50. With chamber
   31 being attached to housing 50, intake port 31 d of chamber 31 opens diagonally
   forward in first attachment surface 3 1ba. Therefore, emission port 32d of fan 32 can
   communicate with intake port 31 d of chamber 31 by inserting fan 32 through the front
10 opening of housing 50. Therefore, in assembly of combustion apparatus 100,
   combustion apparatus 100 can be assembled by inserting both of chamber 31 and fan
   32 through the front opening of housing 50. Since the necessity for an operation for
   assembly on the rear side of housing 50 is thus obviated, the assembly operation is
   facilitated.
15          In maintenance as well, maintenance can be done simply by performing works
   from the front of housing 50. Therefore, a maintenance work is also facilitated.
            Intake port 31 d of chamber 31 opens diagonally forward in first attachment
   surface 3 1ba. Therefore, mixture gas from fan 32 can be fed to chamber 31 diagonally
   rearward from diagonal front. A long length of a path for the mixture gas can thus
20 readily be secured also in small-sized combustion apparatus 100 and the gas is well
   mixed. Therefore, it is not necessary to increase a size of housing 50 for better mixing
   of the gas. Therefore, increase in size can be suppressed.
            Combustion apparatus 100 of which assembly and maintenance are facilitated
   and of which increase in size can be suppressed can thus be obtained.
25          If a suction port of the chamber opens rearward in the housing with the chamber
   being attached to the housing, it is difficult to directly connect the fan case to the
   chamber with a screw after the chamber is arranged in the housing. Therefore, another
   member such as a caulking member is required, the number of components is greater,
   and assemblability and maintenability are deteriorated.
                                               - 20  -

            In the present embodiment, intake port 31 d of chamber 31 opens toward the
   front of housing 50. Therefore, direct connection of fan 32 to chamber 31 with screw
   member 37 from the front of housing 50 is facilitated, another component for
   connection therebetween is not required, the number of components can be decreased,
 5 and assemblability and maintenability are improved.
            In a combustion apparatus of a totally primary combustion type, air and fuel gas
   should be mixed inside a fan. Therefore, sealability and pressure resistance of a fan
   case are required, and consequently a weight of the fan increases. When such a fan is
   mounted on a combustion apparatus of an inverse combustion type, the fan tends to
10 drop due to the weight of the fan in attachment and removal of the fan.
            In contrast, in the present embodiment, as shown in Fig. 3, chamber 31 includes
   engagement portion 3 1c. Engagement portion 3 1c includes opposing portion 3 1ca
   which is opposed to first attachment portion 3 lb with a gap lying therebetween. As
   shown in Fig. 4, fan 32 includes insertion portion 32f. As shown in Figs. 6 and 7,
15 insertion portion 32f is inserted in between first attachment portion 3 lb and opposing
   portion 31ca with chamber 31 and fan 32 being fixed to each other.
            By thus inserting insertion portion 32f in between first attachment portion 3lb
   and opposing portion 31 ca of engagement portion 31 c, insertion portion 32f can be
   engaged with both of first attachment portion 3 lb and opposing portion 31 ca. Thus, as
20 shown in Fig. 12, fan 32 can be held by chamber 31 as being caught thereby before fan
   32 is fixed to chamber 31. Therefore, drop of fan 32 from chamber 31 during an
   operation to fix fan 32 to chamber 31 can be suppressed. Therefore, an operation to fix
   fan 32 to chamber 31 is facilitated.
            In the present embodiment, as shown in Fig. 7, chamber 31 includes inclined
25 surface 3 1bb which continues to first attachment surface 3 1ba in the rear of first
   attachment surface 31ba. With inclined surface 31bb, an area where first attachment
   surface 3 1ba and second attachment surface 32ca are opposed to each other can be
   decreased. Therefore, a high surface pressure between first attachment surface 3 1ba
                                               - 21 -

   and second attachment surface 32ca can be secured. Therefore, sealability between
   first attachment surface 3 1ba and second attachment surface 32ca is improved.
            Portion of joint 3 1bc between first attachment surface 3 1ba and inclined surface
   3 1bb forms a projecting corner portion in the plan view. Therefore, burr is likely in
 5 portion of joint 3 1bc forming the corner portion. In the plan view, however, insertion
   portion 32f is opposed to corner portion 3 1bc with a gap lying therebetween.
   Therefore, burr does not impair sealability between first attachment surface 3 1ba and
   second attachment surface 32ca.
            In the present embodiment, as shown in Figs. 7 and 8, chamber 31 includes
10 reinforcement portion 31 f which connects engagement portion 31 c and first attachment
   surface 31ba to each other at the root of engagement portion 31c. Reinforcement
   portion 31 f reinforces engagement portion 31 c. Therefore, even when a weight of fan
   32 is applied to engagement portion 31 c due to engagement of insertion portion 32f
   with engagement portion 31 c, break or bending of engagement portion 31 c can be
15 suppressed.
            In the present embodiment, as shown in Fig. 9, insertion portion 32f is provided
   in first side end portion 32cb closer to the position of center of gravity G of fan 32 than
   second side end portion 32cc. By thus providing insertion portion 32f in first side end
   portion 32cb close to the position of center of gravity G, fan 32 is well balanced when
20 insertion portion 32f is engaged with engagement portion 31 c. An operation to attach
   fan 32 to chamber 31 is thus further facilitated.
            In the present embodiment, as shown in Fig. 9, intake port 31 d of chamber 31
   opens diagonally forward in first attachment surface 3 1ba. Therefore, fixing member
   37 inserted into housing 50 through the front opening of housing 50 can fix chamber 31
25 and fan 32 to each other. An operation to fix chamber 31 and fan 32 to each other with
   the use of fixing member 37 can also be performed from the front of housing 50 and
   attachment and maintenance are facilitated. In particular, when such an angle that the
   line which is the extension of the central axis of through hole 32e on the side of first
   side end portion 32cb (the chain dotted line close to first side end portion 32cb in Fig.
                                                - 22 -

   11) does not intersect with the front end portion of side plate portion 50b of housing 50
   in the plan view is set, workability for fixing a screw is further improved.
            In the present embodiment, as shown in Fig. 3, height HI from intake port 31 d,
   of one screw member 37 of two screw members 37 located above intake port 31d of
 5 chamber 31 is greater than height H2 of the other screw member from intake port 31 d.
   Even when motor 32b is attached to the upper portion of fan 32, one screw member 37
   can be attached above intake port 3 1d while avoiding motor 32b.
            Height HI from intake port 31d of one screw member 37 of two screw members
   37 located above intake port 31 d of chamber 31 is greater than height H2 of the other
10 screw member from intake port 31d. The other screw member 37 is arranged closer to
   intake port 31d than one screw member 37. Therefore, first attachment surface 31ba
   provided with intake port 31 d and second attachment surface 32ca provided with
   emission port 32d can more reliably be sealed.
            In the present embodiment, as shown in Fig. 4, cut portion 32h is provided in
15 the central portion of the lower end of second attachment portion 32c. Thus, in
   attachment of fan 32 to chamber 31, a projecting portion on the upper surface of
   chamber 31 can be avoided owing to cut portion 32h and attachment of fan 32 to
   chamber 31 is facilitated. A height of second attachment portion 32c can be maintained
   low. Therefore, a large gap between top plate portion 50d of housing 50 and fan 32 can
20 be secured and attachment of fan 32 to chamber 31 is facilitated also in this regard.
