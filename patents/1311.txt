CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION
[0001] This is a divisional application of Australian Patent Application No. 2015230721, the
disclosure of which is incorporated by reference in its entirety herein.
FIELD
[0002] Many systems have been utilized to treat spinal deformities such as scoliosis,
spondylolisthesis, and a variety of others. Primary surgical methods for correcting a spinal
deformity utilize instrumentation to correct the deformity as much as possible, as well as
implantable hardware systems to rigidly stabilize and maintain the correction. Presently, most
of these implantable hardware systems rigidly fix the spinal column or allow limited growth
and/or other movement of the spinal column, to help facilitate fusion after the column has been
moved to a corrected position.

DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS
[0033] Some embodiments relate to a system for correcting spinal deformities, as well as
associated methods and devices. In general terms, the system provides for lateral translational

                                                    9
corrective force(s) and/or derotational corrective force(s) on a spinal column. Some features of
the system include highly adaptive hardware for connecting the system to the spinal column,
where the hardware facilitates a more natural range of motion within pre-selected limits and
application of such lateral translational and/or derotational corrective force(s).
[0034] Various planes and associated directions are referenced in the following description,
including a sagittal plane defined by two axes, one drawn between a head (superior) and tail
(inferior) of the body and one drawn between a back (posterior) and front (anterior) of the body;
a coronal plane defined by two axes, one drawn between a center (medial) to side (lateral) of the
body and one drawn between a head (superior) and tail (inferior) of the body; and a transverse
plane defined by two axes, one drawn between a back and front of the body and one drawing
between a center and side of the body. The terms pitch, roll, and yaw are also used, where roll
generally refers to angulation, or rotation, in a first plane through which a longitudinal axis of a
body orthogonally passes (e.g., rotation about a longitudinal axis corresponding to the spinal
column), pitch refers to angulation, or rotation, in a second plane orthogonal to the first plane,
and yaw refers to angulation, or rotation, in a third plane orthogonal to the first and second
planes. In some embodiments, pitch is angulation in the sagittal plane, yaw is angulation in the
coronal plane, and roll is angulation in the transverse plane.
[0035] In various embodiments, changes in pitch, yaw, and/or roll occur concurrently or
separately as desired. Moreover, as used herein, "lateral translation" is not limited to translation
in the medial-lateral direction unless specified as such.
[0036] FIG. 1 is a perspective view of a system 10 for correcting a spinal deformity, according
to some embodiments. The system 10 includes a rod 12, a plurality of rod anchors 14, including
a first rod anchor 14A and a second rod anchor 14B, a plurality of vertebral anchors 18
including a first vertebral anchor 18A and a second vertebral anchor 18B, a plurality of
adjustment mechanisms 20 including a first adjustment mechanism 20A and a second
adjustment mechanism 20B, and a plurality of force directing members 22 including a first force
directing member 22A and a second force directing member 22B. As shown, the system 10 is
secured to a spinal column 24 formed of a plurality of vertebrae 26, including a first vertebra
26A, a second vertebra 26B, a third vertebra 26C, and a fourth vertebra 26D.

                                                   10
[0037] Although the system 10 is shown with two rod anchors 14, two vertebral anchors 18, two
adjustment mechanisms 20, and two force directing members 22, more or fewer are
implemented as appropriate. For example, in some embodiments a single vertebral anchor 18 is
secured to a vertebra 26 at an apex of a spinal deformation or other location, with a
corresponding force directing member 22 and adjustment mechanism 20 coupled to such
vertebral anchor 18.
[0038] As shown in FIG. 1, however, the first and second vertebral anchors 18A, 18B are fixed
to a portion of the spinal column 24 having an abnormal curvature (e.g., scoliosis) in need of
correction. The system 10 is optionally used to incrementally bring the spinal column 24 to a
more natural curvature, or a single adjustment is made to the system 10 to accomplish the
desired curvature. In other embodiments, an abnormal curvature in the spinal column 24 has
been adjusted to a more natural curvature using other hardware, prior to or in conjunction with
securing the system 10 to the spinal column 24.
[0039] FIG. 2 shows the system 10 from a transverse plane view, with portions of the spinal
column 24 and system 10 not shown for illustrative purposes. For reference, the rod 12, the first
vertebral anchor 18A, the first adjustment mechanism 20A, and the first force directing member
22A are shown along with the first vertebra 26A and third vertebra 26C.
[0040] In some embodiments, the rod 12, also described as an elongate member, is secured to
the spinal column 24 at a pre-selected offset from a longitudinal axis of the spinal column 24.
For example, the rod 12 is optionally secured at an offset along a medial-lateral axis ML, or
right-left axis, and anterior-posterior axis AP, or back-front axis. In some embodiments, the rod
12 is secured on the left side of the spinal column 24. As subsequently described, the offset is
optionally selected to cause at least a relative lateral translation (e.g., central or medial
movement) and derotational shift (e.g., clockwise rotation from the bottom view of FIG. 2) of
selected vertebrae 26 of the spinal column 24 (relative anterior-posterior movement of selected
vertebrae 26 can also be accomplished) such that the spinal column 24 exhibits a more natural
position.
[0041] FIG. 3 shows the rod 12 having a bend according to some embodiments. In some
embodiments, the rod 12 is substantially rigid, defining a substantially round cross-section with
a mean diameter of about 6mm and being formed of a suitable biocompatible material, such as

                                                   11
titanium alloy ASTM F136. The rod 12 is adapted, or otherwise structured, to extend along the
spinal column 24. In FIG. 1, the bend of the rod 12 is generally shown for illustrative purposes.
In various embodiments, the rod 12 is bent in one or more of the sagittal and coronal planes. If
desired, the rod 12 incorporates some flex, or springiness while substantially rigidly retaining its
shape. The rod 12 is optionally formed of a variety of materials, including stainless steel or
suitable polymeric materials. Moreover, as subsequently described, the cross-sectional shape of
the rod 12, including various portions thereof, is not limited to circular cross-sections.
[0042] As shown in FIG. 3, in some embodiments the rod 12 is contoured or angled to at least
partially mimic a curvature (e.g., sagittal plane kyphosis or lordosis or, alternatively, an existing,
defective curvature, e.g., kyphosis or lordosis) of a portion of a spinal column. Although shown
with a single bend, such that the rod 12 is substantially non-linear, in other embodiments the rod
12 includes substantially curved, non-linear sections, or incorporates combinations of
substantially bent, straight, and/or curved sections.
[0043] The rod 12 has a longitudinal axis X, as well as a first section 30, a second section 32,
and an intermediate section 34 between the first and second sections 30, 32. Where the rod 12 is
substantially straight, the longitudinal axis X is substantially straight. Where the rod 12 is
substantially curved or angled, the longitudinal axis X is similarly curved or angled. The
sections 30, 32, 34 of the rod 12 are optionally continuously formed or are formed as separate,
connected parts as desired. In some embodiments, the second section 32 and intermediate
section 34 define an inner angle Ia less than 180 degrees, for example a bend angle from about
135 to about 170 degrees, although a variety of bend angles are contemplated.
[0044] In some embodiments, at least one or both of the first and second sections 30, 32 are
generally non-round or otherwise define chase features. For example, as shown in FIGS. 3 and
4, the second section 32 forms at least one flat 36, the second section 32 having a substantially
D-shaped cross-section along at least a portion thereof. In turn, the first section 30 and
intermediate section 34 have substantially circular cross-sections, although any of the sections
30, 32, 34 optionally have non-circular, cross-sectional shapes as desired (e.g., star-, oval-, or
square-shaped cross-sections). As will be subsequently described, a cross-sectional shape of a
particular section is optionally used to limit rotation of the rod 12, although cross-sectional
modifications to selectively enhance bending performance and other characteristics of the rod 12
are also contemplated (e.g. I-beam, hexagonal, or other shapes).

                                                  12
[0045] At least some of the intermediate section 34 optionally includes a surface treatment, such
as surface roughening 38 (e.g., knurling or dimpling), or other treatment (e.g., coatings, plasma
treatments, or others) for enhancing friction and/or performance. In turn, portions of the first
and second sections 30, 32 optionally include mirror finishes, surface coatings (e.g., PTFE), or
other materials or surface treatments. Though some examples have been provided, various
combinations of surface treatments for portions of each of the sections 30, 32, 34 are
contemplated.
[0046] FIG. 4 shows a rod 12A according to some other embodiments. The rod 12A is
substantially straight, or linear, and includes any of the features described in association with the
rod 12 as appropriate. In FIG. 4 features of the rod 12A similar to those of the rod 12 are
designated with the same reference number as the rod 12 followed by an "A."
[0047] In some embodiments, the rod 12A is of a two-piece design and includes a rod
adjustment mechanism 39 which provides means for increasing an effective length of the rod
12A. The rod adjustment mechanism 39 is optionally a female threaded sleeve adapted to
extend or contract (lengthen or shorten) a gap between pieces of the rod 12A by turning the
adjustment mechanism 39 to engaging threads 37 on the sleeve. The adjustment mechanism 39
optionally has flats or other surface features for receiving a tool (e.g., an open ended wrench).
One example of another female, sleeve-type adjustment mechanism generally suitable for use
with some embodiments described herein is shown in U.S. Patent 4,078,559, issued March 14,
1978.
[0048] Additional examples of rods in accordance with some embodiments of the system 10 are
set forth in U.S. Application No. 11/196,952, filed on August 3, 2005 and entitled DEVICE
AND METHOD FOR CORRECTING A SPINAL DEFORMITY, as well as 12/134,058, filed
on June 5, 2008 and entitled MEDICAL DEVICE AND METHOD TO CORRECT
DEFORMITY, the entire contents of both of which are hereby incorporated by reference.
[0049] FIGS. 5a and 5b show features of the first rod anchor 14A, according to some
embodiments. As shown in FIG. 5a, the first rod anchor 14A is adapted, or otherwise
structured, to be mounted, or fixed to one or more vertebrae, such as the first vertebra 26A (FIG.
1). The first rod anchor 14A is further adapted to receive, and includes means for receiving, the
rod 12 such that the rod 12 is secured laterally, against lateral translation relative to the first rod

                                                   13
anchor 14A. In some embodiments, the rod 12 is substantially prevented from translating in a
direction substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal axis X at the first point Pl. In turn, the
rod 12 (shown in cut-away) is able to slide axially, or translate axially, along the longitudinal
axis X, relative to the first rod anchor 14A through a first pivot point P1. The rod 12 is also able
to change in pitch, yaw, and roll about the first pivot point P1.
[0050] The first rod anchor 14A is optionally formed of biocompatible metallic materials, such
as titanium, stainless steel, and/or biocompatible polymeric materials, such as PEEK and/or
composite materials. In some embodiments, and as shown in FIGS. 5a, the first rod anchor 14A
includes a single-piece housing 40 having receptacle portion 48 adapted, or otherwise
structured, to receive the rod 12. The first rod anchor 14A further includes a mounting portion
50 adapted to secure the first rod anchor 14A to one or more vertebrae, such as the first vertebra
26A and an additional vertebra 26 above or below the first vertebra. In other embodiments, the
mounting portion 50 is secured to a single vertebra, such as the first vertebra 26A (e.g., laterally
across the first vertebra 26A at the pedicles, or at a single point - such as a single pedicle - on
the first vertebra 26A.
[0051] As subsequently described, in some embodiments, the housing 40 is of a multi-piece
design (e.g., as shown in FIGS. 7 - 11).
[0052] In some embodiments, the mounting portion 50, also described as a plate, is adapted to
be secured at two or more points, for example spanning between two vertebrae (e.g., the L3-L4
vertebrae) or spanning across a portion of a single vertebra (e.g., pedicle-to-pedicle on a single
vertebra).
[0053] FIG. 5b shows the receptacle portion 48 in cross-section. According to various
embodiments, the receptacle portion 48 is generally ring-shaped and forms a passage 52 having
a revolute, convex surface 54 having an upper curve 56 and a lower curve 58. The receptacle
portion 48 is adapted to allow the rod 12 to pass through the passage 52 at the first pivot point
P1, where the passage 52 defines a minimum effective diameter (e.g., providing appropriate
clearance between the rod 12 and receptacle portion 48) that allows the rod 12 to slide through
passage 52. The passage 52 also allows the rod 12 to rotate and angulate about the longitudinal
axis X at the first pivot point P1 while minimizing lateral translation or inhibiting substantial
lateral translation. In at least this manner, the rod 12 is able to rotate and angulate about the

                                                  14
longitudinal axis X at the first pivot point while lateral translation of the rod 12 with respect to
the receptacle portion 28 is substantially limited in all planes. In alternate terms, the rod 12 is
able to slide within the passage 52 and change in yaw, pitch, and roll at the first pivot point P1,
while being constrained from side-to-side movement within the passage 52 at the first pivot
point P1.
[0054] In some embodiments, the mounting portion 50 includes a stem 60 and a pedestal 62, the
pedestal 62 having an central portion 64, a first anchor point 66, and a second anchor point 68,
the central portion 64 extending between the first and second anchor points 66, 68 and each of
the anchor points 66, 68 defining a surface suitable for mounting the first rod anchor 14A to one
or more vertebrae 26. The first and second anchor points 66, 68 optionally include through
holes 70, 72, respectively, for receiving a fastener (not shown), such as a pedicle screw or
similar device to secure the mounting portion 50 to one or more vertebra 26, such as the first
vertebra 26A (FIG. 1).
[0055] In some embodiments, the first rod anchor 14A is adapted, or otherwise structured, to
limit pitch and yaw of the rod 12 to a predefined range. For example, the rod 12 is able to
angulate within a range until opposing surfaces of the rod 12, contact, or bind with the upper and
lower curves 56, 58 of the convex surface 54. In other words, a radius of curvature of the
convex surface 54 is optionally selected to control a range of motion of the rod 12. In some
embodiments, pitch and yaw of the rod 12 is limited to within an angular range Ra of about 60
degrees, for example. As subsequently described in association with the second rod anchor 14B,
various means of limiting roll and/or sliding of the rod 12 within a predefined range are also
contemplated.
[0056] Although in some embodiments the mounting portion 50 is adapted to receive one or
more fasteners as shown in FIGS. 5a and 5b, FIG. 6 shows the first rod anchor 14A with the
mounting portion 50 being adapted to act as a fastener, similar to that of a pedicle screw. Thus,
the first rod anchor 14a optionally includes fastener means for securing the first anchor 14A to
one of the vertebra 26.
[0057] Although FIGS. 5a, 5b, and 6 are illustrative of some potential features the system 10,
FIGS. 7 and 8 show a first rod anchor 114A according to some other embodiments, where FIG.
7 is a perspective view with the rod 12 received by the first rod anchor 1 14A and FIG. 8 is a

                                                   15
cross-sectional view of the first rod anchor 114A with the rod 12 removed. The first rod anchor
1 14A is substantially similar to the first rod anchor 14A, although a housing 140 of the first rod
anchor 114A includes a receptacle portion 148A and a sleeve portion 148B. In some
embodiments, the sleeve portion 148B is substantially spherical in shape and the receptacle
portion 148A forms a substantially spherical mating race for the sleeve portion 148B.
[0058] As shown in FIG. 8, the receptacle portion 148A has a revolute, substantially concave
surface 154A and the sleeve portion 148B has a revolute, substantially convex surface 154B.
The surfaces 154A, 154B are adapted, or otherwise structured, to form a substantially
complementary fit with one another, such that the sleeve portion 148B is captured by the
receptacle portion 148A and is allowed relative rotational and angular movement with respect to
the receptacle portion 148A.
[0059] The sleeve portion 148B has a passage 152 defining a pivot point P11 through which the
rod 12 is able to be slidably received. As with other embodiments, the complementary
relationship between the sleeve portion 148B and the receptacle portion 148A is optionally
designed to restrict, or limit, certain relative movement of the rod 12 with respect to the first rod
anchor 114A. For example, in some embodiments, pitch and yaw of the rod 12 about the pivot
point P11 is limited when opposing surfaces of the rod 12 contact the receptacle portion 148A
proximate a front 156 and/or a back 158 of the receptacle portion 148A.
[0060] FIG. 9 is a perspective view of the second rod anchor 14B and FIGS. 10 and 11 are
perspective views of portions thereof. The second rod anchor 14B is adapted to be fixed, and
provides means for fixation to a second vertebra, such as a second vertebra 26B (FIG. 1). The
second rod anchor 14B is further adapted to receive, and provides means for receiving the rod
12 (FIG. 1) such that the second rod anchor 14B limits translational movement of the rod 12
except along the longitudinal axis X and allows the rod 12 to change in at least pitch and yaw
about a second pivot point P2. The second rod anchor 14B is optionally substantially similar to
the first rod anchor 14A or first rod anchor 114A, including any desired combination of
previously-described features.
[0061] The second rod anchor 14B is optionally formed of biocompatible metallic materials,
such as titanium or stainless steel and/or biocompatible polymeric materials, such as PEEK. In
some embodiments, and as shown in FIG. 9, the second rod anchor 14B includes a housing 200

                                                    16
having receptacle portion 202 and a sleeve portion 204 adapted to receive the rod 12, the second
rod anchor 14B further including a mounting portion (e.g., similar to the mounting portion 50 of
the first rod anchor 14A) adapted to secure the second rod anchor 14B to the second vertebra
26B.
[0062] The second rod anchor 14B is optionally adapted, or otherwise structured, to limit
rotation, or roll, of the rod 12 about the longitudinal axis X of the rod 12 (FIG. 3). In particular,
the second rod anchor 14B provides means for allowing the rod 12 to angulate without
substantial lateral translation relative to the second rod anchor 14B or substantial rotation about
the longitudinal axis X. The sleeve portion 204 is optionally spherical in shape and the
receptacle portion 202 forms a substantially spherical mating race, where rotation of the sleeve
portion 204 relative to the receptacle portion 202 is substantially inhibited in at least one plane.
[0063] FIG. 10 shows the receptacle portion 202 and FIG. 11 shows the sleeve portion 204,
where the receptacle portion 202 has a revolute, substantially concave inner surface 210 and the
sleeve portion 204 has a revolute, substantially convex outer surface 212. The surfaces 210, 212
are adapted to form a substantially complementary fit with one another, such that the sleeve
portion 204 is captured by the receptacle portion 202 and is allowed relative angular movement
with respect to the receptacle portion 202.
[0064] As shown in FIG. 10, the receptacle portion 202 also includes a pair of protrusions 216
(e.g., pins), extending inwardly from and at opposite sides of the inner surface 210. In turn, as
shown in FIG. 11, the sleeve portion 204 has a circumferential groove 218 adapted to slidably
receive the protrusions 216 and an internal passage 220 through which the rod 12 is able to be
slidably received. A pivot point P2 is also defined in the passage 220, the rod 12 passing
through the pivot point P2.
[0065] The passage 220 optionally has a non-circular cross-section (e.g., a substantially D
shaped cross-section corresponding to the second section 32 of the rod 12). Upon mating the
non-circular cross-sections of the rod 12 and the passage 220, rotation of the rod 12 relative to
the sleeve portion 204 is substantially inhibited.
[0066] Upon slidably receiving the protrusions 216 in the circumferential groove 218 the pitch
and yaw of the rod 12 are able to change. Relative rotation between the sleeve portion 204 and
the receptacle portion 202, however, is substantially inhibited. Thus, as relative rotation

                                                    17
between the sleeve portion 204 and the receptacle portion 202 is also substantially inhibited,
relative rotation between the rod 12 and the second rod anchor 14B is substantially inhibited or
limited, allowing the rod 12 to be maintained at a pre-selected rotational position relative to the
second rod anchor 14B. It also should be understood that other cross-sectional shapes for each
of the passage 220 and rod 12 can be selected to allow some degree of rotation about the
longitudinal axis X within a predefined range, including, for example, that shown in FIG. 12,
where the rod 12 is shown with features allowing rotation up to a stop 220A formed by the
sleeve 204. The cross-sectional shape of the rod 12 is also optionally selected to limit axial
translation of the rod 12 as desired.
[0067] As with other embodiments, the second rod anchor 14B is also optionally adapted to
restrict, or limit angulation of the rod 12 (e.g., pitch and yaw) with respect to the second rod
anchor 14B. For example, pitch and yaw of the rod 12 about the pivot point P2 is limited when
the rod 12 contacts the receptacle portion 202 proximate a front 222 and/or a back 224 of the
receptacle portion 202. A size and shape of the receptacle and/or sleeve portions 202, 204 is
selected to define such limit(s) as desired.
[0068] FIG. 13 shows the first vertebral anchor 18A and first force directing member 22A from
a front elevation view. The first vertebral anchor 18A, also described as an anchor arm, is
adapted to be fixed, and provides means for fixation, to a third vertebra 26C (FIG. 1). As
previously described, the first vertebral anchor 18A is fixed to a portion of the spinal column 24
(FIG. 1) having an abnormal curvature in need of correction.
[0069] The first and second vertebral anchors 18A, 18B are optionally substantially similar, and
thus various features of both the first and second vertebral anchors 18A, 18B are described in
association with the first vertebral anchor 18A, where when referenced, features of the first
vertebral anchor 18A are designated with reference numbers followed by an "A" and similar
features of the second vertebral anchor 18B are designated with similar reference numbers
followed by a "B."
[0070] The first vertebral anchor 18A includes an arm 250A and a head 252A. In some
embodiments, the arm 250A extends from the head 252A to a terminal end 254A and is
disposed generally perpendicular to the head 252A. The arm 250A is optionally rotatable
relative to the head 252B and is adapted to extend across a portion of the third vertebra 26C, for

                                                 18
example, from one side of the spinal column 24 to an opposite side of the spinal column 24. For
example, the first vertebral anchor 18A is secured to the third vertebra 26C such that the arm
250A extends across the third vertebra 26C through a hole or hollowed portion in the spinous
processes (not shown) of the third vertebra 26C.
[0071] The head 252A is adapted, or is otherwise structured, to be fixed to a portion of the third
vertebra 26C, such as a pedicle of the third vertebra 26C. The head 252A optionally includes
and/or is adapted to work in conjunction with any of a variety of structures capable of engaging
the third vertebra 26C. For example, the first vertebral anchor 18A optionally includes a pedicle
screw 256A secured through the head 252A to a pedicle of the third vertebra 26C.
[0072] The first force directing member 22A is secured to the first vertebral anchor 18A at an
appropriate location on the first vertebral anchor 18A. For example, in some embodiments the
first force directing member 22A is secured to the first vertebral anchor 18A at least at the
terminal end 254A of the arm 250A such that the first force directing member 22A extends from
the terminal end 254A of the arm 250A.
[0073] Additional examples of vertebral anchors (also described as "implants") in accordance
with some embodiments of the system 10 are set forth in U.S. Application No. 11/196,952, filed
on August 3, 2005 and entitled DEVICE AND METHOD FOR CORRECTING A SPINAL
DEFORMITY, as well as 12/134,058, filed on June 5, 2008 and entitled MEDICAL DEVICE
AND METHOD TO CORRECT DEFORMITY, the entire contents of both of which are hereby
incorporated by reference.
[0074] FIGS. 14a and 14b show the first adjustment mechanism 20A, where FIG. 14b shows the
first adjustment mechanism 20A with a portion removed to illustrate inner features thereof. In
some embodiments, the first adjustment mechanism 20A provides means for securing the first
force directing member 22A to the rod 12. In some embodiments, the first adjustment
mechanism 20A, also described as a tensioner or coupler, is further adapted to adjust, and
provides means for adjusting a length of the first force directing member 22A. The first and
second adjustment mechanisms 20A, 20B are optionally substantially similar. Thus, various
features of both the first and second adjustment mechanisms 20A, 20B are described in
association with the first adjustment mechanism 20A, where features of the first adjustment
mechanism 20A are designated with reference numbers followed by an "A" and similar features

                                                  19
of the second adjustment mechanism 20B are designated with the same reference numbers
followed by a "B."
[0075] In some embodiments, the first adjustment mechanism 20A includes a reel 260A, a
circumferential gear 262A surrounding the reel 260A, a vertical gear 264A in contact with the
circumferential gear 262A, an actuation head 268A, and a housing 270A.
[0076] The reel 260A, as well as the circumferential gear 260A and vertical gear 264A are
maintained at least partially within the housing 270A. In turn, the housing 270A is adapted to
be secured to the rod 12. For example, the housing 270A optionally forms a central lumen
through which the rod 12 is receivable. Upon inserting the rod 12 through the central lumen, the
housing 270A is adapted to be clamped onto the rod 12.
[0077] In some embodiments, the housing 270A incorporates a clamshell design (e.g., a first
portion adjustably secured to a second portion) adapted to be tightened onto the rod 12 (e.g.,
using one or more fasteners). Thus, in some embodiments, the first adjustment mechanism 20A
is substantially fixed with respect to the rod 12. In other embodiments, however, the first
adjustment mechanism 20A is movable with respect to the rod 12, for example being able to
rotate about the rod 12.
[0078] The first force directing member 22A is attached or secured to the reel 260A and passes
out of the housing 270A through an appropriately sized opening in the housing 270A. Actuation
of the vertical gear 264A via the actuation head 266A turns the circumferential gear 262A,
which turns the reel 260A, thus winding (or unwinding, depending on the direction in which the
reel 260A is turned) the first force directing member 22A about the reel 260A. Rotation of the
reel 260A in the appropriate direction draws the first force directing member 22A in toward the
first adjustment mechanism 20A, pulling the first vertebral anchor 18A (FIG. 13) toward the
first adjustment mechanism 20A according to some methods of correcting a spinal defect.
[0079] Additional examples of adjustment members (also described as "adjustment
mechanisms"), in accordance with some embodiments of the system 10 are set forth in U.S.
Application No. 11/196,952, filed on August 3, 2005 and entitled DEVICE AND METHOD
FOR CORRECTING A SPINAL DEFORMITY, as well as 12/134,058, filed on June 5, 2008
and entitled MEDICAL DEVICE AND METHOD TO CORRECT DEFORMITY, the entire
contents of both of which are hereby incorporated by reference.

                                                  20
[0080] As shown in FIGS. 13 and 14, the first and second force directing members 22A, 22B
are optionally substantially similar, and thus various features of both the first and second force
directing members 22A, 22B are described in association with the first force directing member
22A, where features of the first force directing member 22A are designated with reference
numbers followed by an "A" and similar features of the second force directing member 22B are
designated with similar reference numbers followed by a "B."
[0081] In some embodiments, the first force directing member 22A is substantially flexible such
that the first force directing member 22A is able to be pivoted in a multiple directions and/or be
spooled or wound, for example. Suitable flexible materials for forming the first force directing
member 22A include wire and stranded cables, monofilament polymer materials, multifilament
polymer materials, multifilament carbon or ceramic fibers, and others. In some embodiments,
the first force directing member 22A is formed of stainless steel or titanium wire or cable,
although a variety of materials are contemplated.
[0082] The first force directing member 22A, also described as a connector or cable, is adapted
to be secured to the first vertebral anchor 18A and the first adjustment member 20A, the force
directing member 22A defining an effective length between the first adjustment mechanism 20A
and the first vertebral anchor 18A, and thus the rod 12 (although, in some embodiments, the first
force directing member 22A is secured directly to the rod 12). As described, in some
embodiments, the first adjustment mechanism 20A is adapted to modify, and provides means for
modifying, the effective length of the force directing member 22A. The first force directing
member 22A has a body 280A and extends from a first end 282A to a second end 284A.
[0083] FIG. 1 shows the assembled system 10. In some embodiments, assembly of the system
10 includes securing the first and second force directing members 22A, 22B to the first and
second vertebral anchors 18A, 18B, respectively. The first and second force directing members
22A, 22B are also secured to the first and second adjustment mechanisms 20A, 20B. The first
and second adjustment mechanisms 20A, 20B are secured to the rod 12. The first and second
rod anchors 14A, 14B are secured to the first and second vertebrae 26A, 26B, respectively. The
rod 12 is received in the first and second rod anchors 14A, 14B to secure the rod 12 against
lateral translation relative to the spinal column 24. The first and second vertebral anchors 18A,
18B are secured to the third and fourth vertebrae 26C, 26D. Upon assembly of the system 10,
the first and second adjustment mechanisms 20A, 20B are adjusted as desired to pull the first

                                                    21
and second vertebral anchors 18A, 18B toward the first and second adjustment mechanisms
20A, 20B, and thus the rod 12.
[0084] The first force directing member 22A is assembled to the first vertebral anchor 18A by
securing the first end 282A of the first force directing member 22A to the first vertebral anchor
18A proximate the terminal end 254A thereof. In some embodiments, the first force directing
member 22A is secured at the terminal end 254A of the first vertebral anchor 18A, and extends
along at least a portion of the arm 250A to the head 252A, although the first force directing
member 22A is attached at any location along the arm 250A and/or the head 252A of the first
vertebral anchor 18A as appropriate. The first force directing member 22A is securable to the
first vertebral anchor 18A via a variety of methods, including welding, adhesives, tying, and/or
screw fixation, for example.
[0085] The second force directing member 22B and the second vertebral anchor 18B are
optionally secured or connected together using similar approaches.
[0086] As previously described, the first force directing member 22A extends to the first
adjustment mechanism 20A, enters the housing 250A, and is wound about the reel 260A,
thereby coupling the first adjustment mechanism 20A to the first vertebral anchor 18A as well as
the rod 12. In some embodiments, the first force directing member 22A is secured to the reel
260A via welding, screw fixation, adhesives, and/or is sufficiently wound about the reel 260A
for frictional retention of the first force directing member 22A on the reel 260A.
[0087] The second force directing member 22A and the second adjustment mechanism 20B are
optionally secured or connected together using similar approaches.
[0088] The rod 12 is received by the housings 40, 200 of the first and second rod anchors 14A,
14B, respectively. Features of the first and second rod anchors 14A, 14B are selected to limit
pitch, yaw, roll, and axial sliding of the rod 12 as desired.
[0089] The rod 12 is secured against lateral translation relative to the longitudinal axis of the
spinal column 14 by securing the first and second rod anchors 14A, 14B to at least the first and
second vertebra 26A, 26B, respectively. The first rod anchor 14A is secured to at least the first
vertebra 26A, for example by screwing the first rod anchor 14A to the first vertebra 26A (e.g., at
or near the transverse processes) using one or more pedicle screws. The second rod anchor 14B

                                                   22
is similarly secured to at least the second vertebra 26B. The first rod anchor 14A and/or the
second rod anchor 14B are optionally secured to multiple vertebrae 26 for enhanced stability.
[0090] In some embodiments, the rod 12 is attached by the rod anchors 14A, 14B to transverse
processes on the left side of the spinal column 24 and is able to slide axially relative to the first
and/or second rod anchors 14A, 14B. In other embodiments, the rod 12 is attached by the rod
anchors 14A, 14B to the right side of the spinal column 24, on different sides of the spinal
column 24 (e.g., the first rod anchor 14A on the left side and the second rod anchor 14B on the
right side), or along the mid-line of the spinal column 24. In other embodiments, the rod 12 is
adjustable length to compensate for changes in length of the spinal column 24. Regardless, the
interaction between the rod 12 and the first and second rod anchors 14A, 14B helps facilitate
growth and more natural movement of the spinal column 24.
[0091] FIGS. 15a, 15b, and 15c show various stop features 286 for limiting axial sliding, or
translation of the rod 12 relative to a rod anchor, such as the first rod anchor 14A. Generally,
sliding of the rod 12 in a particular axial direction is substantially limited, or arrested, when a
stop feature 286 engages, or abuts an adjacent rod anchor 14.
[0092] As shown in FIG. 15a, the rod 12 optionally includes a narrowed portion 286a received
in the first rod anchor 14A with wider, adjacent portions 286b of the rod 12 limiting axial
sliding of the rod 12. As shown, although axial sliding of the rod 12 is substantially prevented
by locating the stop features 286 adjacent the first rod anchor 14A, there is still some tolerance
allowed, or play, as appropriate in the fit between the wider portions 286b of the rod 12 and the
first rod anchor 14A.
[0093] As shown in FIG. 15b, the system 10 optionally includes stops 286c, or collars, that are
fit onto the rod 12 adjacent the first rod anchor 14A to substantially limit axial sliding of the rod
12 within the first rod anchor 14A. In some embodiments, the stops 286c are metal or
polymeric collars crimped onto the rod 12, although a variety of designs and methods of
securing are employed as desired. As shown, although axial sliding of the rod 12 is
substantially prevented with respect to the first rod anchor 14A, there is still some limited play
or slop as appropriate in the fit between the rod 12 and the stops 286c.
[0094] As shown in FIG. 15c, the system 10 optionally utilizes both a stop 286c and a narrowed
portion 286a with a wider portion 286b to limit axial sliding of the rod 12 relative to the first rod

                                                  23
anchor 14A within a desired range of motion. For example, as shown in FIG. 15c, the stop 286c
is located toward an end of the rod 12 on one side of the first rod anchor 14A and the wider
portion 286b is located on the other side of the first rod anchor 14A with a desired spacing
between the stop 286c and the wider portion 286b. Any combination of stop features 286 and
spacing are implemented as appropriate.
[0095] FIG. 16 is a diagrammatical view of a system 10A similar to that of FIG. 1, where FIG.
16 illustrates various degrees of freedom of the rod 12 at the first and second rod anchors 14A,
14B, according to some embodiments. As shown, the system 10A further includes a third
vertebral anchor 18C secured to a fifth vertebra 26D. The third vertebral anchor is substantially
similar to the first and/or second vertebral anchors 18A, 18B. The system 10 also optionally
includes a corresponding third force directing member 22C, e.g., a cable or wire, and a third
adjustment mechanism 20C. Although adjustment mechanisms 20 including means for
adjusting the effective length of the force directing members 22 have been described, in some
embodiments one or more of the adjustment mechanisms 20 acts as a means for coupling a
corresponding force directing member to the rod 12 without incorporating such adjustment
features. For example, the third adjustment mechanism 20C, or any of the adjustment
mechanisms described herein, is optionally a crimp or fastener means for securing the force
directing member 22C to the rod 12 (e.g., a clamp or crimp).
[0096] The rod 12 is bent (e.g., as shown in FIG. 3) and, as designated by the directional
arrows, is free to change in pitch, yaw, and roll, as well as to slide axially along the longitudinal
axis X at the first rod anchor 14A (and thus, at the first pivot point P1) and is free to change in
pitch and yaw at the second rod anchor 14B while relative changes in roll and axial sliding are
substantially limited or substantially prevented at the second rod anchor 14B (and thus, at the
second pivot point P2). In some embodiments, collars 288A or other stop features (such as
those previously described) are located on the rod 12 (e.g., crimped onto the rod 12) on either
side of the second rod anchor 14B in order to inhibit sliding movement of the rod 12. In turn, a
stop feature 288B (such as one of those previously described) is located proximate a terminus of
the rod 12 in order to help prevent the rod 12 from slipping off the first rod anchor 14A.
[0097] The interaction between the vertebral anchors 18A, 18B, adjustment mechanisms 20A,
20B, and in particular the flexible nature of their respective coupling through use of the force
directing members 22A, 22B allows the system 10 to move dynamically with the spinal column

                                                  24
24, while exerting and/or maintaining a corrective force (e.g., lateral and derotational forces) on
the third and fourth vertebrae 26C, 26D. In other words, the system 10 is semi-constrained,
providing a lateral and derotational anchor point while facilitating at least some degree of
natural movement in the spinal column 24.
[0098] Moreover, by limiting rotation, or roll, of the rod 12, the bend in the rod 12 is oriented
and maintained in a desired rotational position. Maintaining the rotational orientation at one end
(i.e., at the second rod anchor 14B) is useful, for example, to help ensure that the bend or shape
of the rod 12 consistently follows or otherwise appropriately tracks a desired curvature of a
spinal column 24. Freedom of rotation at the other end of the rod 12 (i.e., at the first rod anchor
14A), however, still permits the spinal column 24 to have more natural movement while the
corrective forces are being applied.
[0099] Thus, according to various embodiments, the spinal column 24 (and thus, the person) is
able to twist, bend side-to-side, and bend forward-and-backward in a more natural manner while
corrective forces are being applied to the spinal column 24. In some embodiments, the effective
lengths of the force directing members 22A, 22B are adjusted (e.g., periodically or all at one
time), bringing the spinal column into natural alignment, while the system 10 still facilitates a
more natural movement of the spinal column 24 (e.g., twisting and bending forward-and
backward and side-to-side) due to the freedom of movement afforded by the system 10.
[0100] FIG. 17 is a diagrammatical view of a system 1OB illustrating various degrees of
freedom of the rod 112 at the first rod anchor 14A and a second rod anchor 290 substantially
similar to the first rod anchor 14A, according to some other embodiments of the system 10.
With the system 1OB, the rod 112 is substantially straight (FIG. 4) and, as designated by the
directional arrows, is free to change in pitch, yaw, and roll, as well as to slide axially along the
longitudinal axis X, at each of the first and second rod anchors 14A, 290.
[0101] In some embodiments, each of the first and second rod anchors 14A, 290 shown
generally in FIG. 16 are substantially the same as the first rod anchor 14A shown in FIGS. 5a
and 5b, for example. In other embodiments, each of the first and second rod anchors 14A, 290
are substantially the same as the first rod anchor 1 14A shown in FIGS. 7 and 8, although any
combination of the previously-described anchor features described in association with any of the
rod anchors 14A, 114A, 14B are contemplated.

                                                  25
[0102] The rod 112 also optionally includes stop features 300, such as the stop features 286
previously described, to help prevent the rod 112 from slipping out of the first and second rod
anchors 14A, 290. In this manner, the rod 112 is able to slide axially, along the longitudinal
axis X (FIG. 4) until one of the stop features 300 contacts one of the first and second rod
anchors 14A, 290. Once again, the system 1OB provides dynamic adjustment and movement
with the spine, while exerting a corrective force (e.g., translational and derotational forces) on
the vertebrae 26 (e.g., the third and fourth vertebrae 24C, 24D).
[0103] FIGS. 18 and 19 show systems 10C, 1OD, respectively, demonstrating variations in axial
rod constraint according to some embodiments. The systems 1OC, 1OD are each shown
including a first rod anchor 360 and a second rod anchor 370 which incorporate features of any
of the anchors previously described. The axial arrows indicate freedom of movement of the
associated rods, although a designation of degrees of freedom in pitch, yaw, and roll at the
anchors 360, 370 are left from FIGS. 18 and 19 for ease of illustration. Various degrees of
freedom at the anchors 360, 370 are incorporated as appropriate.
[0104] As shown in FIG. 18, the system 1OC includes a rod 375 (e.g., similar to the rod 12A)
including a rod adjustment mechanism 376 (e.g., similar to the rod adjustment mechanism 39), a
first stop feature 380A, a second stop feature 380B, and a third stop feature 380C, the stop
features 380A, 380B, 380C being secured to and/or formed with the rod 375 (e.g., similar to the
stop features being similar to any of the stop features 286 previously described).
[0105] The rod 375 is substantially constrained against axial sliding by the second and third stop
features 380B, 380C at the second rod anchor 370 and is allowed some axial sliding, or axial
translation, outwardly away from the first stop feature 380A. In some embodiments, the stop
features 286 and the first and second rod anchors 360, 370 provide means for imposing a
distraction force on the spinal column 24 and/or for limiting compression of the spinal column
24 along one or more sides of the spinal column 24 (e.g., left, right, anterior, and/or posterior
sides).
[0106] In some embodiments, the rod adjustment mechanism 376 is used to apply a distraction
force by expanding an effective length of the rod 375 such that the first and second stop features
380A, 380B engage the first and second rod anchors 360, 370 resulting in a compressive force
on the rod 375 that the rod 375 substantially rigidly resists. The compressive force on the rod

                                                     26
375, in turn, results in a distraction, or elongation force on a side of the spinal column 24 to
which the anchors 360, 370 of the system 1OC are coupled. Moreover, the stop features
additionally or alternatively provide a limit on compression of the spinal column 24 at the first
side of the spinal column 24 by limiting relative movement of the anchors 36, 370 toward one
another on the rod 375.
[0107] Although the rod 375 of the system 1OC is placed under a compressive load, the rod 375
is able to move axially in a first direction, e.g., to allow further distraction and/or natural
movement - e.g., such that the spinal column 24 (and thus, the person) is able to twist, bend
side-to-side, and bend forward-and-backward in a more natural manner while distractive forces
are being applied to the spinal column 24. In turn, axial movement of the rod 375 in a second
direction generally opposite the first direction is limited (e.g., thereby limiting compression of
the spinal column 24 beyond the axial limit set by the stop features 286). Moreover, although
the system 1 OC is described as applying a distraction force and/or compressive limit to one side
of the spinal column 24, in other embodiments a distraction force is applied to both sides of the
spinal column 24, to an anterior side of the spinal column 24, to a posterior side of the spinal
column 24, or combinations thereof.
[0108] As shown in FIG. 19, the system 1OD includes a rod 400 (e.g., similar to the rod 12A)
including a rod adjustment mechanism 402 (e.g., similar to rod adjustment mechanism 39), a
first stop feature 41 0A and a second stop feature 41 OB, the stop features 41 0A, 41 OB being
secured to and/or formed with the rod 400 (e.g., similar to any of the stop features 286
previously described). The rod 400 is substantially constrained against axial sliding and/or
outward expansion by the first and second stop features 410A, 4 1OB, the stop features 41A,
41 OB providing means for imposing a compressive force on the spinal column 24 and/or for
limiting distraction of the spinal column 24 along one or more sides of the spinal column 24
(e.g., left, right, anterior, and/or posterior sides). In some embodiments, the rod adjustment
mechanism 402 is used to apply a contraction or tensioning force on the spinal column to which
the system 1 OD is coupled by contracting or shortening the rod 400 using the adjustment
mechanism 402 such that the first and second stop features 41 OA, 41 OB engage the first and
second rod anchors 360, 370 to apply a compressive force to the spinal column (not shown).
[0109] Although the rod 400 of the system 1OD is placed under a tensile load, the rod 400 is
able to move axially in a first direction, for example, to allow further compression of the spinal

                                                  27
column 24 (and thus, the person) is able to twist, bend side-to-side, and bend forward-and
backward in a more natural manner while compressive forces are being applied to the spinal
column 24. Axial movement of the rod 400 is still substantially limited in a second direction
generally opposite the first direction, for example, limiting distraction of the spinal column 24
beyond the axial limit set by the stop features 286. Moreover, although the system 1OD is
described as applying a compressive force and/or distraction limit to one side of the spinal
column 24, in other embodiments a tensile, or compressive force is applied to both sides of the
spinal column 24, to an anterior side of the spinal column 24, to a posterior side of the spinal
column 24, or combinations thereof. In further embodiments, the system 1OD can apply a
compressive force and/or distraction limit to one side of the spinal column 24, while the system
1OC applies a distraction force and/or compression limit to the opposite side of the spinal
column 24.
[0110] In view of the foregoing, systems, methods, and devices according to the various
embodiments provided herein help minimize a number of anchor points utilized for correction,
facilitate use of straight or contoured rods, and/or help promote a more natural, physiologic
motion of the spinal column 24 during or after correction of the deformity.
[0111] Various modifications and additions can be made to the exemplary embodiments
discussed without departing from the scope of the present invention. For example, while the
embodiments described above refer to particular features, the scope of this invention also
includes embodiments having different combinations of features and embodiments that do not
include all of the described features. Accordingly, the scope of the present invention is intended
to embrace all such alternatives, modifications, and variations as fall within the disclosure
herein, together with all equivalents thereof.
