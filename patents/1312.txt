   [0001]
   The present disclosure relates to a device and a method.
   [Background Art]
20 [0002]
   Device-to-device communication (D2D communication) is communication in which
   two or more terminal devices transmit and receive signals directly, unlike typical
   cellular communication in which a base station and a terminal device transmit and
   receive signals.               For this reason, it is anticipated that D2D communication will be
25 used to create new usage scenarios for terminal devices that differ from the typical
   cellular communication above.                  For example, various applications are conceivable,
   such as information sharing by data communication between nearby terminal devices
   or among a group of nearby terminal devices, distribution of information from an
   installed terminal device, and autonomous communication between machines, called
30 machine-to-machine (M2M) communication.

                                                     2
   Additionally, it is conceivable that D2D communication will be put to effective use
   in data offloading in response to the significant increase in data traffic due to the
   recent increase in smartphones.          For example, in recent years, there has been a sharp
   rise in the necessity to transmit and receive video image streaming data.           However,
 5 since video images typically have large data sizes, there is a problem of consuming
   many resources on a radio access network (RAN).                    Consequently, if terminal
   devices are in a state suitable for D2D communication with each other, such as when
   the terminal devices are a short distance away from each other, video image data may
   be offloaded to D2D communication, thereby moderating the resource consumption
10 and processing load on a RAN.            In this way, D2D communication provides value to
   both telecommunications carriers and users.            For this reason, D2D communication
   is currently recognized as one crucial technology area for Long Term Evolution
   (LTE), and is receiving attention from the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP)
   standards committee.
15 [0004]
   For example, Non Patent Literature 1 discloses a case in which D2D communication
   is performed in an uplink subframe within a network coverage area in the case of
   time division duplex (TDD).

25 [0006]
   For example, as radio resources available for D2D communication, periodic radio
   resources are allocated.          For example, at periods of an integer multiple of a radio
   frame, radio resources of a specific subframe are allocated as the radio resources
   available for D2D communication.             Therefore, D2D communication is performed in
30 the specific subframe.
   [0007]
   10324969_1(GHMatters)P103669.AU.1

                                                        3
   For example, when D2D communication is performed in a TDD carrier, radio
   resources of an uplink subframe of an uplink/downlink configuration (UL/DL
   configuration) of the TDD carrier are allocated as the radio resources available for
   D2D         communication            within a network     coverage    area.  Therefore,  D2D
 5 communication is performed in the uplink subframe.
   [0008]
   However, when the UL/DL configuration of the TDD carrier is dynamically changed,
   the uplink subframe in which D2D communication is performed may be changed to a
   downlink subframe or a special subframe.                As a result, D2D communication may be
10 performed in the downlink subframe or the special subframe.                    That is, D2D
   communication that does not comply with cellular communication standards may be
   performed.
   [0009]
   Accordingly, it is preferable to provide a mechanism in which a terminal device can
15 appropriately perform D2D communication under a TDD environment.

   [0019]
   <<1. Introduction>>
   First, technology related to D2D communication will be described with reference to
10 FIGS. 1 to 7.
   [0020]
   (Use case of D2D communication)
   In general LTE systems, an evolved Node B (eNB) and a user equipment (UE)
   perform radio communication, but UEs do not perform radio communication to each
15 other. However, a method in which the UEs directly perform radio communication
   to each other is necessary for an application for public safety (for example, an
   application such as collision avoidance) or data offloading.
   [0021]
   Use cases of D2D communication are discussed in 3GPP service and systems aspects
20 (SA) 1 and the like, and are described in TR 22.803.              Also, in TR 22.803, use cases
   are disclosed, but specific implementation methods are not disclosed.              Hereinafter,
   specific examples of the use case will be described with reference to FIGS. 1 and 2.
   [0022]
   FIG. 1 is a first explanatory diagram illustrating a specific example of a use case of
25 D2D communication.                   Referring to FIG. 1, multiple UEs 10 and an eNB 20 are
   illustrated.          As a first use case, for example, an UE 10A and an UE 1OB positioned
   within a network coverage area (for example, inside a cell 21 of the eNB 20) perform
   D2D communication.                   Such D2D communication is referred to as in-coverage D2D
   communication.                  As a second use case, for example, an UE 1OC and an UE 1OD
30 positioned outside of the network coverage area perform D2D communication.
   Such D2D communication is referred to as out-of-coverage D2D communication.
   10324969_1(GHMatters)P103669.AU.1

                                                         9
   As a third use case, for example, an UE 1OE positioned within the network coverage
   area and an UE 10F positioned outside of the network coverage area perform D2D
   communication.                  Such D2D communication is referred to as partial-coverage D2D
   communication.                    From the viewpoint of public safety, out-of-coverage D2D
 5 communication and partial-coverage D2D communication are also important.                     Also,
   the network coverage area refers to a coverage area of a cellular network.               That is, a
   set of cells builds the network coverage area.
   [0023]
   FIG. 2 is a second explanatory diagram illustrating a specific example of a use case
10 of D2D communication.                   Referring to FIG. 2, an UE 10A and an UE 10B, and an
   eNB 20A and an eNB 20B are illustrated.                 In this example, the eNB 20A is operated
   by a first mobile network operator (MNO) and the eNB 20B is operated by a second
   MNO.          Then, the UE 10A positioned within a first network coverage area (for
   example, inside a cell 21A of the eNB 20A) and the UE 10B positioned within a
15 second network coverage area (for example, inside a cell 21B of the eNB 20B)
   perform D2D communication.                     From the viewpoint of public safety, such D2D
   communication is also important.
   [0024]
   (Flow up to D2D communication)
20 For example,                 synchronization, discovery, and connection        establishment   are
   sequentially performed, and then D2D communication is performed.                       Hereinafter,
   considerations of steps of synchronization, discovery, and connection establishment
   will be described.
   [0025]
25 (a) Synchronization
   When two UEs are positioned within the network coverage area, the two UEs obtain
   synchronization with the eNB using a downlink signal from the eNB and thus are
   able to be synchronized to each other to some extent.
   [0026]
30 On the other hand, when at least one of two UEs attempting to perform D2D
   communication is positioned outside of the network coverage area, at least one of the
   10324969_1(GHMatters)P103669.AU.1

                                                            10
   two UEs is necessary to transmit a synchronization signal for synchronization in
   D2D communication.
   [0027]
   (b) Discovery of other UEs
 5 Discovery of other UEs is performed by, for example, transmitting and receiving a
   discovery signal.                 More specifically, for example, one UE of the two UEs transmits
   the discovery signal, and the other UE of the two UEs receives the discovery signal
   and attempts to communicate with the one UE.
   [0028]
10 The discovery signal is preferably transmitted at a predetermined timing in a time
   direction.           Accordingly, it is possible to restrict a timing at which the UE of a
   reception side attempts to receive the discovery signal.                   Also, as the assumption,
   two UEs attempting to perform D2D communication may obtain synchronization in
   advance before the discovery signal is received.
15 [0029]
   (c) Connection establishment
   The two UEs attempting to perform D2D communication may establish a connection,
   for example, as follows.                First, a first UE transmits a discovery signal and a second
   UE receives the discovery signal.                  Then, the second UE transmits a request message
20 requesting connection establishment to the first UE.                  Then, the first UE transmits a
   completion message indicating completion of connection establishment to the second
   UE in response to the request message.
   [0030]
   (Synchronization signal transmitted by eNB)
25 In LTE, the eNB transmits a primary synchronization signal (PSS) and a secondary
   synchronization signal (SSS) as a synchronization signal.                  The PSS and the SSS are
   transmitted at a predetermined timing in a frame structure of a radio frame.
   Hereinafter, a specific example of timings of the PSS and the SSS in frequency
   division duplex (FDD) and time division duplex (TDD) will be described with
30 reference to FIGS. 3 and 4.
   [0031]
   10324969_1(GHMatters)P103669.AU.1

                                                    11
   FIG. 3 is an explanatory diagram illustrating exemplary timings of a PSS and an SSS
   in FDD.             Referring to FIG. 3, 10 subframes included in the radio frame are
   illustrated.           In FDD, in subframes (that is, a first subframe and a sixth subframe)
   having subframe numbers 0 and 5, the PSS and the SSS are transmitted.                     More
 5 specifically, the SSS is transmitted in a sixth symbol of a first slot included in each of
   the subframes, and the PSS is transmitted in a seventh symbol of the first slot.
   [0032]
   FIG. 4 is an explanatory diagram illustrating exemplary timings of a PSS and an SSS
   in TDD.             Referring to FIG. 4, 10 subframes included in the radio frame are
10 illustrated.           In TDD, in subframes (that is, a second subframe and a seventh
   subframe) of subframe numbers 1 and 6, the PSS is transmitted.              More specifically,
   in a third symbol of a first slot included in each subframe, the PSS is transmitted.
   In addition, in TDD, in subframes (that is, a first subframe and a sixth subframe) of
   subframe numbers 0 and 5, the SSS is transmitted.               More specifically, in a seventh
15 symbol of a second slot included in each subframe, the SSS is transmitted.
   [0033]
   When the PSS is detected, the UE can recognize a timing of each subframe.                    In
   addition, when the SSS is detected, the UE can recognize which subframe is a
   subframe #0.
20 [0034]
   Furthermore, the UE can identify a cell group to which a cell formed by the eNB that
   transmits the PSS belongs among three cell groups based on a sequence of the PSS.
   In addition, the UE can identify a cell formed by the eNB that transmits the SSS
   among 168 cell candidates that belong to one cell group based on a sequence of the
25 SSS.        That is, the UE can identify a cell formed by the eNB that transmits the PSS
   and the SSS among 504 cell candidates based on the sequence of the PSS and the
   sequence of the SSS.
   [0035]
   (Synchronization signal of D2D communication)
30 For example, when the UE is positioned within the network coverage area,
   synchronization for D2D communication is performed based on the synchronization
   10324969_1(GHMatters)P103669.AU.1

                                                      12
   signal transmitted by the eNB.             For example, when the UE is positioned outside of
   the network coverage area, synchronization for D2D communication is performed
   based on the synchronization signal transmitted by another UE.                       Also, the
   synchronization signal may be a relayed signal.
 5 [0036]
   The synchronization signal used by a terminal device for D2D communication may
   have various attributes.             For example, the synchronization signal may have an
   attribute of a transmission source.           The transmission source may be the eNB or the
   UE.        For example, the synchronization signal may have an attribute of presence or
10 absence of relay.
   [0037]
   When the synchronization signal is wirelessly relayed, deterioration of precision of a
   center frequency is concerned.              Accordingly, it is preferable that the number of
   relays (the number of hops) be smaller.
15 [0038]
   The eNB is more preferable than the UE as the transmission source of the
   synchronization signal.            This is because precision of an oscillator of the eNB is
   higher than precision of an oscillator of the UE.
   [0039]
20 (Radio resources available for D2D communication)
   (a) Resource pool
   As radio resources available for D2D communication, radio resources called a
   resource pool are prepared.              As the resource pool, periodic radio resources are
   considered.             For example, the resource pool is represented by a period and an offset
25 (in a time direction).
   [0040]
   As a method of using the resource pool, two methods may be provided.                In the first
   method, a management node (for example, the eNB or the UE) allocates radio
   resources among the resource pool to the UE and notifies the UE of the radio
30 resources.             The UE can perform D2D communication in the allocated radio
   resources.            In the second method, the UE selects radio resources from among the
   10324969_1(GHMatters)P103669.AU.1

                                                          13
   resource pool, and performs D2D communication in the radio resources.                    The first
   method is a non-contention-based method and there is no collision.                  On the other
   hand, the second method is a contention-based method, and collision may occur.
   [0041]
 5 (b) Multiple resource pools
   It is considered natural that multiple resource pools are prepared.              In this case, the
   period and the offset of the resource pool may be different from periods and offsets
   of other resource pools.               Also, the period of the resource pool may be the same as
   periods of other resource pools while the offset of the resource pool is different from
10 offsets of the other resource pools.
   [0042]
   Hereinafter, the radio frame and the subframe serving as a unit of time in a cellular
   system will be described with reference to FIG. 5. A specific example of the
   resource pool will be described with reference to FIG. 6.
15 [0043]
   FIG. 5 is an explanatory diagram illustrating a radio frame and subframes in a
   cellular system.               Referring to FIG. 5, the radio frame and 10 subframes included in
   one radio frame are illustrated.              Each radio frame is 10 ms, and each subframe is 1
   ms.       Each radio frame has a system frame number (SFN) of any of 0 to 1023, and
20 1024 radio frames are repeatedly presented.
   [0044]
   FIG. 6 is an explanatory diagram illustrating an exemplary resource pool.               Referring
   to FIG. 6, two resource pools (that is, a resource pool #1 and a resource pool #2) are
   illustrated.           The radio resources available for D2D communication are considered to
25 be periodically arranged in the subframe.                    For example, the resource pool #1
   includes radio resources of subframes 31 that are repeated at a period 33, and the
   resource pool #2 includes radio resources of subframes 35 that are repeated at a
   period 37.            For example, the period 33 is 200 ms, and the period 37 is 400 ms.
   Also, in this example, the resource pool #1 and the resource pool #2 have different
30 offsets.

   (c) Signal/information transmitted in resource pool
   For example, in the resource pool, a synchronization signal and synchronization
   information (information of synchronization) are transmitted by a representative UE.
   In addition, the UE performs D2D communication in radio resources other than the
 5 radio resources in which the synchronization signal and the synchronization
   information are transmitted among the resource pool.                 Hereinafter, a specific
   example thereof will be described with reference to FIG. 7.
   [0046]
   FIG. 7 is an explanatory diagram illustrating an example of a signal and information
10 transmitted in a resource pool.             Referring to FIG. 7, N resource pools (that is,
   resource pools #1 to #N) are illustrated.             In each of the N resource pools, the
   synchronization signal and the synchronization information are transmitted.               In
   addition, in each of the N resource pools, D2D communication may be performed in
   radio resources other than the radio resources in which the synchronization signal
15 and the            information    are  transmitted.    Also,  one UE     may transmit    the
   synchronization signal and the synchronization information in two or more resource
   pools.

   <<2. Technical problems according to embodiments of present disclosure >>
20 First, technical problems according to embodiments of the present disclosure will be
   described with reference to FIG. 8.
   [0048]
   (Premises)
   For example, as radio resources available for D2D communication, periodic radio
25 resources are allocated.           For example, at periods of an integer multiple of a radio
   frame, radio resources of a specific subframe are allocated as the radio resources
   available for D2D communication.             Therefore, D2D communication is performed in
   the specific subframe.
   [0049]
30 For example, when D2D communication is performed in a TDD carrier, radio
   resources of an uplink subframe of a UL/DL configuration of the TDD carrier are
   10324969_1(GHMatters)P103669.AU.1

                                                       15
   allocated as the radio resources available for D2D communication within a network
   coverage area.               Therefore, D2D communication is performed in the uplink subframe.
   A specific example thereof will be described below with reference to FIG. 8.
   [0050]
 5 FIG. 8 is an explanatory diagram illustrating a UL/DL configuration.              Referring to
   FIG. 8, seven configurations (configurations 0 to 6) that may be selected as the
   UL/DL configuration of the TDD carrier are illustrated.                      In each of the
   configurations, each of 10 subframes included in a radio frame is determined as a
   downlink subframe, an uplink subframe or a special subframe.                  As an example,
10 when the UL/DL configuration of the TDD carrier is the configuration 2, radio
   resources of any of subframes having subframe numbers 2 and 7 are allocated as the
   radio resources available for D2D communication.               As another example, when the
   UL/DL configuration of the TDD carrier is the configuration 3, radio resources of
   any of subframes having subframe numbers 2, 3, and 4 are allocated as the radio
15 resources available for D2D communication.
   [0051]
   (First technical problem)
   In the case of in-coverage, the base station may notify the terminal device of the
   radio resources available for D2D communication.              However, when the base station
20 freely selects the radio resources available for D2D communication without
   constraints, the base station may use many radio resources in order to notify the radio
   resources available for D2D communication.              As a result, from the viewpoint of the
   radio resources, a load on the base station may become large.
   [0052]
25 Referring again to FIG. 8, for example, when the UL/DL configuration of the TDD
   carrier is the configuration 2, radio resources of a subframe having a subframe
   number 7 are allocated as the radio resources available for D2D communication.
   Then, the UL/DL configuration is changed from the configuration 2 to the
   configuration 3. Therefore, the subframe having a subframe number 7 becomes the
30 downlink subframe.                 As a result, D2D communication may be performed in the
   downlink subframe.
   10324969_1(GHMatters)P103669.AU.1

                                                    16
   [0053]
   Accordingly, it is preferable to provide a mechanism in which the terminal device
   can appropriately perform D2D communication under a TDD environment.                   More
   specifically, for example, it is preferable to provide a mechanism in which the
 5 terminal device can continuously perform D2D communication in the uplink
   subframe under the TDD environment.
   [0054]
   (Second technical problem)
   In addition, when radio resources of the uplink subframe of the UL/DL configuration
10 of the TDD carrier are freely allocated as the radio resources available for D2D
   communication, a negative influence may occur in TDD radio communication
   between the base station and the terminal device.
   [0055]
   For example, when the uplink subframe is allocated for D2D communication, the
15 terminal device transmits no uplink signal in the uplink subframe.           Therefore, for
   example, communication quality in an uplink of the terminal device may decrease.
   As an example, when a user of the terminal device makes a call, a transmission
   interval of audio data by the terminal device may be longer.         Therefore, a delay may
   occur when audio data is transmitted.             As a result, communication quality may
20 decrease.           As another example, transmission of ACK/NACK (that is, ACK/NACK
   of downlink data) by the terminal device in an uplink at an appropriate timing is
   considered to be difficult.         Specifically, errors or delays are considered to occur
   when ACK/NACK is transmitted in the uplink.
   [0056]
25 Accordingly, it is preferable to provide a mechanism in which the terminal device
   can appropriately perform D2D communication under the TDD environment.                 More
   specifically, for example, it is preferable to provide a mechanism in which a negative
   influence occurring in TDD radio communication between the base station and the
   terminal device due to D2D communication can be reduced.

   Next, a schematic configuration of a communication system 1 according to an
   embodiment of the present disclosure will be described with reference to FIG. 9.
   FIG. 9 is an explanatory diagram illustrating an example of a schematic
   configuration of the communication system 1 according to the embodiment of the
 5 present disclosure.               Referring to FIG. 9, the communication system 1 includes a
   base station 100 and a terminal device 200.                   The communication system 1 is, for
   example, a cellular system, and is a system compliant with, for example, LTE, LTE
   Advanced, or communication standards conforming thereto.
   [0058]
10 (The base station 100)
   The base station 100 performs radio communication with the terminal device.                     For
   example, the base station 100 performs radio communication with the terminal
   device 200 which is positioned inside a cell 101 of the base station 100.
   [0059]
15 Especially, in the embodiment of the present disclosure, the base station 100
   performs radio communication in TDD.                    Specifically, for example, the base station
   100 uses the TDD carrier, transmits a downlink signal in the downlink subframe, and
   receives an uplink signal in the uplink subframe.                 The TDD carrier is a carrier for
   TDD radio communication, for example, a component carrier.
20 [0060]
   Also, in FIG. 9, only one base station (that is, the base station 100) included in the
   communication system 1 is illustrated.                It is needless to say that the communication
   system 1 may include multiple base stations.                  Then, a set of multiple base stations
   builds the network coverage area (that is, a coverage area of the cellular network).
25 [0061]
   (The terminal device 200)
   The terminal device 200 performs radio communication with the base station.                     For
   example, when the terminal device 200 is positioned inside the cell 101 of the base
   station 100, the terminal device 200 performs radio communication with the base
30 station 100.             For example, the terminal device 200 performs radio communication
   with the base station in TDD.                 Specifically, for example, the terminal device 200
   10324969_1(GHMatters)P103669.AU.1

                                              18
   uses the TDD carrier, receives a downlink signal in the downlink subframe, and
   transmits an uplink signal in the uplink subframe.
   [0062]
   Especially, in the embodiment of the present disclosure, the terminal device 200
 5 performs D2D communication.         For example, the terminal device 200 performs
   D2D communication with another terminal device 200.
   [0063]
   <<4. Configuration of Respective Devices>>

15 [0071]
   <4.2. Terminal Device Configuration >>
   FIG. 11 is a block diagram illustrating an exemplary configuration of the terminal
   device 200 according to the embodiment of the present disclosure.                      Referring to
   FIG. 11,            the terminal device 200 includes an antenna unit 210, a radio
20 communication unit 220, a storage unit 230 and a processing unit 240.
   [0072]
   (The antenna unit 210)
   The antenna unit 210 receives a radio signal and outputs the received radio signal to

25 [0079]
   (Dynamic change of UL/DL configuration)
   The base station 100 (the control unit 153) dynamically changes the UL/DL
   configuration of the TDD carrier.
   [0080]
30 (a) Multiple configurations
   For example, the base station 100 (the control unit 153) changes the UL/DL
   10324969_1(GHMatters)P103669.AU.1

                                                         21
   configuration from one configuration among multiple configurations to another
   configuration among the multiple configurations.
   [0081]
   For        example,            the  multiple    configurations   include    seven   configurations
 5 (configurations 0 to 6) illustrated in FIG. 8. That is, the base station 100 (the
   control unit 153) changes the UL/DL configuration from one configuration among
   the seven configurations to another configuration.
   [0082]
   As a specific process, for example, the control unit 153 changes the UL/DL
10 configuration              by changing      an operation parameter       designating the UL/DL
   configuration.              Also, this is only an example of a specific process, and it is needless
   to say that the control unit 153 may perform another process according to mounting.
   [0083]
   (b) Notification of UL/DL configuration
15 For example, the base station 100 (the control unit 153) notifies the terminal device
   of the UL/DL configuration of the TDD carrier.
   [0084]
   (b-1) Notification method
   - Reporting system information
20 For example, the base station 100 (the control unit 153) notifies the terminal device
   of the UL/DL configuration by reporting system information indicating the UL/DL
   configuration.              For example, the system information is a system information block
   (SIB) 1.
   [0085]
25 Accordingly, for example, not only the terminal device in a connection mode but also
   the terminal device in an idle mode can recognize the UL/DL configuration.
   [0086]
   - Separate signaling
   The base station 100 (the control unit 153) may notify the terminal device in a
30 connection mode of the UL/DL configuration using separate signaling in addition to
   reporting the system information.                 The separate signaling may be radio resource
   10324969_1(GHMatters)P103669.AU.1

                                                  22
   control (RRC) signaling.          The terminal device in a connection mode may be, for
   example, the terminal device 200.
   [0087]
   Accordingly, for example, it is possible to notify of a change in the UL/DL
 5 configuration quickly.
   [0088]
   (b-2) Operation of the terminal device 200
   For example, the terminal device 200 (the information acquisition unit 241) acquires
   the UL/DL configuration.          Therefore, the terminal device 200 (the control unit 243)
10 performs radio communication with the base station using the TDD carrier according
   to the UL/DL configuration.
   [0089]
   (Notification of radio resources for D2D communication)
   The base station 100 (the control unit 153) notifies the terminal device of the radio
15 resources for D2D communication appropriate for the UL/DL configuration.                The
   radio resources are radio resources of the TDD carrier.          Also, "radio resources for
   D2D communication" may be simply referred to as "D2D resources" below.
   [0090]
   On the other hand, the terminal device 200 (the information acquisition unit 241)
20 acquires information indicating the D2D resources appropriate for the UL/DL
   configuration (that is, the UL/DL configuration of the TDD carrier that is
   dynamically changed by the base station 100).           Therefore, the terminal device 200
   performs D2D communication using the D2D resources.                The control unit 243 of
   the terminal device 200 controls D2D communication using the D2D resources.
25 [0091]
   (a) D2D resources appropriate for UL/DL configuration
   The D2D resources appropriate for the UL/DL configuration are radio resources of at
   least one uplink subframe of the UL/DL configuration.
   [0092]
30 Referring again to FIG. 8, as an example, when the UL/DL configuration is the
   configuration 1, the D2D resources appropriate for the UL/DL configuration are
   10324969_1(GHMatters)P103669.AU.1

                                                       23
   radio resources of at least one subframe among subframes having subframe numbers
   2, 3, 7, and 8.                   As another example, when the UL/DL configuration is the
   configuration 4, the D2D resources appropriate for the UL/DL configuration are
   radio resources of at least one subframe among subframes having subframe numbers
 5 2 and 3.
   [0093]
   Also, for example, the D2D resources are periodic radio resources.                         More
   specifically, for example, the D2D resources are radio resources that are repeated at
   periods of an integer multiple of a radio frame.           In this case, as long as the period is
10 not one radio frame, the D2D resources are radio resources of a specific subframe of
   a limited radio frame.               The D2D resources may be referred to as a resource pool.
   Multiple resource pools each having a period (and an offset) may be prepared.                The
   D2D resources may be indicated by a period (and an offset) of a radio frame and a
   subframe.
15 [0094]
   (b) Notification method
   For example, the base station 100 (the control unit 153) notifies the terminal device
   of the D2D resources by reporting system information indicating the D2D resources
   appropriate for the UL/DL configuration.               Accordingly, for example, not only the
20 terminal device in a connection mode but also the terminal device in an idle mode
   can recognize the D2D resources.
   [0095]
   Also, the base station 100 (the control unit 153) may notify the terminal device 200
   of the D2D resources using separate signaling.            The separate signaling may be RRC
25 signaling.
   [0096]
   (c) Notification form
   (c-1) Notification of D2D resources according to change of the UL/DL configuration
   As described above, the base station 100 (the control unit 153) changes the UL/DL
30 configuration from one configuration among the multiple configurations to another
   configuration among the multiple configurations.
   10324969_1(GHMatters)P103669.AU.1

                                              24
   [0097]
   As a first notification form, for example, the base station 100 (the control unit 153)
   notifies the terminal device of the D2D resources appropriate for the other
   configuration according to a change of the UL/DL configuration.               The D2D
 5 resources appropriate for the other configuration are radio resources of at least one
   uplink subframe of the other configuration.
   [0098]
   On the other hand, the terminal device 200 (the information acquisition unit 241)
   acquires information indicating the D2D resources of which the base station 100 has
10 notified the terminal device 200.    Therefore, the terminal device 200 uses the D2D
   resources of which the base station 100 has notified the terminal device 200, and
   performs D2D communication.        That is, the control unit 243 of the terminal device
   200 controls D2D communication using the D2D resources of which the base station
   100 has notified the terminal device 200.
15 [0099]
   A specific example of the D2D resources of which the base station 100 has notified
   the terminal device will be described below with reference to FIGS. 12 and 13.
   [0100]
   FIG. 12 is an explanatory diagram illustrating a first example of D2D resources.
20 Referring to FIG. 12, configurations 0 to 6 are illustrated.      In this example, one
   uplink subframe is prepared as the D2D resources for each configuration.            For
   example, the D2D resources appropriate for each of the configurations 0, 1, 3, 4 and
   6 are radio resources of an uplink subframe having a subframe number 3.              In
   addition, for example, the D2D resources appropriate for each of the configurations 2
25 and 5 are radio resources of an uplink subframe having a subframe number 2.
   [0101]
   FIG. 13 is an explanatory diagram illustrating a notification example of the D2D
   resources according to the change of the UL/DL configuration.         Referring to FIG.
   13, for example, the UL/DL configuration of the TDD carrier is changed from the
30 configuration 0 to the configuration 2.       The D2D resources appropriate for the
   configuration 0 are radio resources of a subframe having a subframe number 3. The
   10324969_1(GHMatters)P103669.AU.1

                                                        25
   D2D resources appropriate for the configuration 2 are radio resources of a subframe
   having a subframe number 2.               In this case, the base station 100 (the control unit 153)
   notifies the terminal device of radio resources of an uplink subframe having a
   subframe number 2 as the D2D resources according to the change of the UL/DL
 5 configuration.               As a result, the terminal device 200 does not perform D2D
   communication in a subframe having a subframe number 3 after the change of the
   UL/DL configuration, but performs D2D communication in a subframe having a
   subframe number 2.
   [0102]
10 In this manner, for example, when the UL/DL configuration is changed to any of the
   configurations 0, 1, 3, 4 and 6, the base station 100 (the control unit 153) notifies the
   terminal device of radio resources of an uplink subframe having a subframe number
   3 as the D2D resources.             In addition, for example, when the UL/DL configuration is
   changed to any of the configurations 2 and 5, the base station 100 (the control unit
15 153) notifies the terminal device of radio resources of an uplink subframe having a
   subframe number 2 as the D2D resources.
   [0103]
   Also, in the example of FIG. 12, the D2D resources are radio resources of one
   subframe within a radio frame.                 However, it is needless to say that the D2D
20 resources may be radio resources of two or more subframes within a radio frame.
   [0104]
   In addition, for example, the D2D resources are periodic radio resources and have a
   period (and an offset).            In this case, for example, the base station 100 (the control
   unit 153) notifies of not only the subframe but also the period (and the offset) when
25 the D2D resources are notified of               For example, the period is a period of an integer
   multiple of a radio frame.
   [0105]
   As described above, for example, the base station 100 (the control unit 153) notifies
   the terminal device of the D2D resources appropriate for the other configuration (that
30 is, the changed configuration) according to the change of the UL/DL configuration.
   Accordingly, for example, the terminal device can continuously perform D2D
   10324969_1(GHMatters)P103669.AU.1

                                                     26
   communication in the uplink subframe under the TDD environment.                 That is, even
   when a UL/DL subframe of the TDD carrier is changed, the base station 100 notifies
   the terminal device 200 of the D2D resources (the radio resources of the uplink
   subframe) appropriate for the changed configuration, and the terminal device 200 can
 5 perform D2D communication in the uplink subframe.
   [0106]
   Also, for example, the base station 100 reports system information indicating the
   other configuration (that is, the changed configuration) from immediately before the
   change of the UL/DL configuration to immediately before the following change of
10 the UL/DL configuration.             The base station 100 may notify the terminal device 200
   of the other configuration (that is, the changed configuration) using separate
   signaling immediately before the change of the UL/DL configuration.
   [0107]
   (c-2) Notification of D2D resources appropriate for each of the multiple
15 configurations
   As described above, the base station 100 (the control unit 153) changes the UL/DL
   configuration from one configuration among the multiple configurations to another
   configuration among the multiple configurations.
   [0108]
20 As a second notification form, for example, the base station 100 (the control unit 153)
   notifies the terminal device of the D2D resources appropriate for each of the multiple
   configurations.
   [0109]
   - First example: D2D resources for each configuration
25 As a first example, the radio resources appropriate for each of the multiple
   configurations include the D2D resources for each configuration.            That is, the base
   station 100 (the control unit 153) notifies the terminal device of the D2D resources
   for each configuration included in the multiple configurations.
   [0110]
30 Referring again to FIG. 12, for example, the multiple configurations are the
   configurations 0 to 6.            The D2D resources for each configuration are illustrated.
   10324969_1(GHMatters)P103669.AU.1

                                                         27
   For example, the base station 100 (the control unit 153) notifies the terminal device
   of the D2D resources for each of these configurations.
   [0111]
   On the other hand, the terminal device 200 (the information acquisition unit 241)
 5 acquires information indicating the D2D resources appropriate for the UL/DL
   configuration among the D2D resources appropriate for each of the multiple
   configurations based on the UL/DL configuration of which the base station 100 has
   notified the terminal device.                Therefore, the terminal device 200 performs D2D
   communication using the D2D resources.
10 [0112]
   Referring again to FIG. 13, for example, the UL/DL configuration of the TDD carrier
   is changed from the configuration 0 to the configuration 2.                 In this case, the base
   station 100 notifies the terminal device of the configuration 2, and the terminal
   device 200 (the information acquisition unit 241) acquires information indicating the
15 D2D resources appropriate for the configuration 2 among the D2D resources
   appropriate for each of the configurations 0 to 6.                Therefore, the terminal device
   200 performs D2D communication in the D2D resources appropriate for the
   configuration 2.
   [0113]
20 In addition, for example, the D2D resources are periodic radio resources and have a
   period (and an offset).              In this case, for example, the base station 100 (the control
   unit 153) notifies of not only the subframe but also the period (and the offset) when
   the D2D resources are notified of                For example, the period is a period of an integer
   multiple of a radio frame.
25 [0114]
   As described above, the base station 100 (the control unit 153) notifies the terminal
   device of the D2D resources for each configuration included in the multiple
   configurations.               Accordingly, for example, the terminal device can continuously
   perform D2D communication in the uplink subframe under the TDD environment.
30 That is, even when the UL/DL subframe of the TDD carrier is changed, the terminal
   device 200 can specify the D2D resources (the radio resources of the uplink
   10324969_1(GHMatters)P103669.AU.1

                                                         28
   subframe)             appropriate      for   the  changed    configuration,   and    perform    D2D
   communication in the uplink subframe.
   [0115]
   - Second example: D2D resources common among multiple configurations
 5 As a second example, the radio resources appropriate for each of the multiple
   configurations may be radio resources of at least one uplink subframe common
   among the multiple configurations.                 That is, the base station 100 (the control unit
   153) may notify the terminal device of radio resources of at least one uplink
   subframe common among the multiple configurations as the D2D resources.
10 [0116]
   On the other hand, the terminal device 200 (the information acquisition unit 241)
   may acquire information indicating the D2D resources (that is, radio resources of at
   least one uplink subframe common among the multiple configurations) of which the
   base station 100 has notified the terminal device.                 Therefore, the terminal device
15 200 may use the D2D resources of which the base station 100 has notified the
   terminal device 200 and perform D2D communication.                     That is, the control unit 243
   of the terminal device 200 may control D2D communication using the D2D
   resources of which the base station 100 has notified the terminal device 200.
   [0117]
20 A specific example of the D2D resources will be described below with reference to
   FIG. 14.
   [0118]
   FIG. 14 is an explanatory diagram illustrating a second example of the D2D
   resources.            Referring to FIG. 14, configurations 0 to 6 are illustrated.           In this
25 example, radio resources of an uplink subframe (that is, a subframe having a
   subframe number 2) common among the configurations 0 to 6 are prepared as the
   D2D resources.                 In this case, the base station 100 notifies the terminal device of
   radio resources of an uplink subframe having a subframe number 2 as the D2D
   resources.            Accordingly, either before the change or after the change of the UL/DL
30 subframe of the TDD carrier, the terminal device 200 can perform D2D
   communication in the uplink subframe having the subframe number 2.
   10324969_1(GHMatters)P103669.AU.1

                                                       29
   [0119]
   While the example in which a subframe common among the multiple configurations
   is a subframe having a subframe number 2 has been described, the subframe
   common among the multiple configurations is not limited thereto.                For example, the
 5 multiple configurations may not be seven configurations (that is, the configurations 0
   to 6), but may be some of the seven configurations.                    Therefore, the subframe
   common among the multiple configurations may be a subframe other than the
   subframe having a subframe number 2.                     A specific example thereof will be
   described below with reference to FIG. 15.
10 [0120]
   FIG. 15 is an explanatory diagram illustrating a third example of the D2D resources.
   Referring to FIG. 15, the configurations 0, 1, 3, 4 and 6 are illustrated.                 In this
   example, the multiple configurations are the configurations 0, 1, 3, 4 and 6.
   Therefore, radio resources of an uplink subframe (for example, a subframe having a
15 subframe number 3) common among the configurations 0, 1, 3, 4 and 6 are prepared
   as the D2D resources.             In this case, the base station 100 notifies the terminal device
   of radio resources of an uplink subframe having a subframe number 3 as the D2D
   resources.            Accordingly, either before the change or after the change of the UL/DL
   subframe of the TDD carrier, the terminal device 200 can perform D2D
20 communication in the uplink subframe having the subframe number 3.
   [0121]
   In addition, for example, the D2D resources are periodic radio resources and have a
   period (and an offset).            In this case, for example, the base station 100 (the control
   unit 153) notifies of not only the subframe but also the period (and the offset) when
25 the D2D resources are notified of               For example, the period is a period of an integer
   multiple of a radio frame.
   [0122]
   As described above, the base station 100 (the control unit 153) may notify the
   terminal device of radio resources of at least one uplink subframe common among
30 the multiple configurations as the D2D resources.                Accordingly, for example, the
   terminal device can continuously perform D2D communication in the uplink
   10324969_1(GHMatters)P103669.AU.1

                                             30
   subframe under the TDD environment.       That is, either before the change or after the
   change of the UL/DL subframe of the TDD carrier, the terminal device 200 can
   perform D2D communication in the uplink subframe.
   [0123]
 5 Also, for example, a period (and an offset) of the D2D resources may be common
   among the multiple configurations.    That is, the D2D resources common among the
   multiple configurations may also be prepared.    Accordingly, for example, regardless
   of the change of UL/DL configuration, the terminal device can perform D2D
   communication in the D2D resources.
10 [0124]
   As described above, the base station 100 (the control unit 153) notifies the terminal
   device of the D2D resources appropriate for the UL/DL configuration.          Also, for
   example, the D2D resources refer to a resource pool having a period (and an offset),
   and the base station 100 (the control unit 153) may notify the terminal device of the
15 resource pool (the D2D resources) appropriate for the UL/DL configuration in each
   of multiple resource pools.
   [0125]
   <5.1. Second technical features>
   Next, the second technical features according to the embodiment of the present
20 disclosure will be described with reference to FIGS. 16 to 19.     The second technical
   features are, for example, features that correspond to the second technical problem
   according to the embodiment of the present disclosure described above.
   [0126]
   (D2D resources appropriate for UL/DL configuration)
25 As described above, the base station 100 (the control unit 153) notifies the terminal
   device of the radio resources for D2D communication appropriate for the UL/DL
   configuration (the D2D resources).     In addition, the D2D resources appropriate for
   the UL/DL configuration are the radio resources of at least one uplink subframe of
   the UL/DL configuration.
30 [0127]
   (a) Features of subframe
   10324969_1(GHMatters)P103669.AU.1

                                                    31
   (a-i) Some of two or more successive uplink subframes
   For example, each of the at least one uplink subframe is included in two or more
   successive uplink subframes of the UL/DL configuration.                  That is, the D2D
   resources appropriate for the UL/DL configuration are radio resources of at least one
 5 uplink subframe included in each of the two or more successive uplink subframes of
   the UL/DL configuration.            Also, one or more uplink subframes among the two or
   more successive uplink subframes are not included in the at least one uplink
   subframe.            A specific example of the D2D resources will be described below with
   reference to FIG. 16.
10 [0128]
   FIG. 16 is an explanatory diagram illustrating a fourth example of the D2D resources.
   Referring to FIG. 16, configurations 0 to 6 are illustrated.          For example, the D2D
   resources appropriate for the configuration 0 are radio resources of subframes having
   subframe numbers 3 and 8.             In the configuration 0, a subframe having a subframe
15 number 3 is included in three successive uplink subframes, and a subframe having a
   subframe number 8 is also included in three successive uplink subframes.           The D2D
   resources appropriate for the configuration 1 are radio resources of subframes having
   subframe numbers 3 and 8.            The D2D resources appropriate for the configurations 3
   and 4 are radio resources of a subframe having a subframe number 3. The D2D
20 resources appropriate for the configuration 6 are radio resources of subframes having
   subframe numbers 3 and 7.
   [0129]
   Accordingly, for example, it is possible to decrease a negative influence occurring in
   TDD radio communication between the base station and the terminal device due to
25 D2D communication.                More specifically, for example, even when the uplink
   subframe is unable to be used in TDD radio communication due to D2D
   communication, a maximum interval between the uplink subframes used in TDD
   radio communication hardly becomes longer.                 Therefore, a decrease in uplink
   communication quality due to an increase in the interval of the uplink subframe is
30 suppressed.

                                                    32
   - Limitation of D2D communication
   For example, when the UL/DL configuration includes two or more successive uplink
   subframes, the base station 100 (the control unit 153) notifies the terminal device of
   the D2D resources appropriate for the UL/DL configuration.           On the other hand,
 5 when the UL/DL configuration does not include two or more successive uplink
   subframes, the base station 100 (the control unit 153) does not notify the terminal
   device of the D2D resources appropriate for the UL/DL configuration.
   [0131]
   That is, when the UL/DL configuration includes two or more successive uplink
10 subframes, D2D communication is performed, and when the UL/DL configuration
   does not include two or more successive uplink subframes, no D2D communication
   is performed.
   [0132]
   Referring again to FIG. 16, for example, when the UL/DL configuration of the TDD
15 carrier is any of the configurations 0, 1, 3, 4 and 6, the base station 100 (the control
   unit 153) notifies the terminal device of the D2D resources appropriate for the
   UL/DL configuration.              On the other hand, when the UL/DL configuration of the
   TDD carrier is any of the configurations 2 and 5, the base station 100 (the control
   unit 153) does not notify the terminal device of the D2D resources appropriate for
20 the UL/DL configuration.             That is, when the UL/DL configuration is any of the
   configurations 0, 1, 3, 4 and 6, D2D communication is performed, and when the
   UL/DL configuration is any of the configurations 2 and 5, no D2D communication is
   performed.
   [0133]
25 Accordingly, for example, radio resources of at least one uplink subframe included in
   each of the two or more successive uplink subframes may be used as the D2D
   resources.
   [0134]
   - Limitation of configuration
30 Alternatively, the UL/DL configuration of the TDD carrier may be a configuration
   including two or more successive uplink subframes.

                                                       33
   [0135]
   Referring again to FIG. 16, for example, the UL/DL configuration of the TDD carrier
   may be any of the configurations 0, 1, 3, 4 and 6.            That is, the configurations 2 and
   5 that do not include two or more successive uplink subframes may be excluded.
 5 [0136]
   Accordingly, for example, radio resources of at least one uplink subframe included in
   each of the two or more successive uplink subframes may be used as the D2D
   resources.
   [0137]
10 (a-2) Number of uplink subframes
   As described above, the D2D resources appropriate for the UL/DL configuration are
   radio resources of at least one uplink subframe of the UL/DL configuration.
   [0138]
   The number of uplink subframes included in the at least one uplink subframe may be
15 different according to the number of uplink subframes of the UL/DL configuration.
   [0139]
   For example, when the number of uplink subframes of the UL/DL configuration is
   greater, the D2D resources appropriate for the UL/DL configuration may be radio
   resources of a greater number of uplink subframes.             A specific example of the D2D
20 resources will be described below with reference to FIG. 17.
   [0140]
   FIG. 17 is an explanatory diagram illustrating a fifth example of the D2D resources.
   Referring to FIG. 17, configurations 0 to 6 are illustrated.                 For example, the
   configuration 0 includes six uplink subframes.              The configuration 1 includes four
25 uplink subframes.                 The configuration 2 includes two uplink subframes.        The
   configuration 3 includes three uplink subframes.             The configuration 4 includes two
   uplink subframes.                 The configuration 5 includes one uplink subframe.         The
   configuration 6 includes five uplink subframes.            Since the configurations 0, 1, and 6
   include great numbers of uplink subframes (for example, four or more uplink
30 subframes), the D2D resources appropriate for each of the configurations 0, 1, and 6
   are radio resources of two uplink subframes.                  On the other hand, since the
   10324969_1(GHMatters)P103669.AU.1

                                                      34
   configurations 2, 3, 4, and 5 include small numbers of uplink subframes (for example,
   three or fewer uplink subframes), the D2D resources appropriate for each of the
   configurations 2, 3, 4, and 5 are radio resources of one uplink subframe.
   [0141]
 5 Accordingly, for example, it is possible to decrease a negative influence occurring in
   TDD radio communication between the base station and the terminal device due to
   D2D communication.                   More specifically, for example, even when the uplink
   subframe is unable to be used in TDD radio communication due to D2D
   communication, the uplink subframe used in TDD radio communication may be
10 ensured to some extent in any configuration.                   Therefore, according to the
   configuration, a situation in which the uplink subframe is absent or the number of
   uplink subframes significantly decreases may be avoided.              Therefore, a decrease in
   uplink communication quality due to a decrease of the number of uplink subframes
   may be suppressed.
15 [0142]
   - Limitation of D2D communication
   When the number of uplink subframes of the UL/DL configuration is equal to or
   greater than a predetermined number, the base station 100 (the control unit 153) may
   notify the terminal device of the D2D resources appropriate for the UL/DL
20 configuration.               On the other hand, when the number of uplink subframes of the
   UL/DL configuration is less than the predetermined number, the base station 100 (the
   control unit 153) may not notify the terminal device of the D2D resources
   appropriate for the UL/DL configuration.
   [0143]
25 That is, when the number of uplink subframes of the UL/DL configuration is equal to
   or greater than the predetermined number, D2D communication may be performed,
   and when the number of uplink subframes is less than the predetermined number, no
   D2D communication may be performed.
   [0144]
30 As an example, the predetermined number may be 3.               In this case, when the UL/DL
   configuration is any of the configurations 0, 1, 3, and 6, the base station 100 (the
   10324969_1(GHMatters)P103669.AU.1

                                                       35
   control unit 153) may notify the terminal device of the D2D resources appropriate for
   the UL/DL configuration.               On the other hand, when the UL/DL configuration is any
   of the configurations 2, 4, and 5, the base station 100 (the control unit 153) may not
   notify the terminal device of the D2D resources appropriate for the UL/DL
 5 configuration.              That is, when the UL/DL configuration is any of the configurations
   0, 1, 3, and 6, D2D communication may be performed, and when the UL/DL
   configuration is any of the configurations 2, 4, and 5, no D2D communication may
   be performed.
   [0145]
10 As another example, the predetermined number may be 2.                  In this case, when the
   UL/DL configuration is any of the configurations 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6, the base station
   100 (the control unit 153) may notify the terminal device of the D2D resources
   appropriate for the UL/DL configuration.                On the other hand, when the UL/DL
   configuration is the configuration 5, the base station 100 (the control unit 153) may
15 not notify the terminal device of the D2D resources appropriate for the UL/DL
   configuration.              That is, when the UL/DL configuration is any of the configurations
   0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6, D2D communication may be performed, and when the UL/DL
   configuration is the configuration 5, no D2D communication may be performed.
   [0146]
20 Accordingly, for example, although the number of uplink subframes of the
   configuration is small, it is possible to prevent the uplink subframe from not being
   used in TDD radio communication due to D2D communication.
   [0147]
   - Limitation of configuration
25 Alternatively, the UL/DL configuration may also be a configuration including a
   predetermined number or more of uplink subframes.
   [0148]
   As an example, the predetermined number may be 3. In this case, the UL/DL
   configuration of the TDD carrier may be any of the configurations 0, 1, 3, and 6.
30 That is, the configurations 2, 4, and 5 in which the number of uplink subframes is
   less than 3 may be excluded.
   10324969_1(GHMatters)P103669.AU.1

                                                        36
   [0149]
   As another example, the predetermined number may be 2.                  In this case, the UL/DL
   configuration of the TDD carrier may be any of the configurations 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6.
   That is, the configuration 5 in which the number of uplink subframes is less than 2
 5 may be excluded.
   [0150]
   Accordingly, for example, although the number of uplink subframes of the
   configuration is small, it is possible to prevent the uplink subframe from not being
   used in TDD radio communication due to D2D communication.
10 [0151]
   (b) Features of period
   The D2D resources appropriate for the UL/DL configuration may be periodic radio
   resources that are repeated at periods corresponding to the number of uplink
   subframes of the UL/DL configuration.
15 [0152]
   (b-1) First example
   When the number of uplink subframes of the UL/DL configuration is greater, a
   period of the D2D resources appropriate for the UL/DL configuration may be shorter.
   A specific example of the period for each configuration will be described below with
20 reference to FIG. 18.
   [0153]
   FIG. 18 is an explanatory diagram illustrating a first example of the period for each
   configuration.              Referring to FIG. 18, periods and subframes of seven configurations
   (configurations 0 to 6) are illustrated.              In this example, similar to the example
25 illustrated in FIG. 12, the D2D resources appropriate for each of the configurations
   are radio resources of one uplink subframe.                For example, the configurations 0, 1,
   and 6 include four or more uplink subframes, and a period of the D2D resources
   appropriate for the configurations 0, 1, and 6 is 100 ms (that is, 10 radio frames).
   The configurations 2, 3, and 4 include two or three uplink subframes, and a period of
30 the D2D resources appropriate for the configurations 0, 1, and 6 is 200 ms (that is, 20
   radio frames).               The configuration 5 includes one uplink subframe, and a period of
   10324969_1(GHMatters)P103669.AU.1

                                                      37
   the D2D resources appropriate for the configuration 5 is 400 ms (that is, 40 radio
   frames).
   [0154]
   Accordingly, for example, as the number of uplink subframes of the configuration is
 5 great, a greater number of D2D resources (the D2D resources having a shorter period)
   are ensured.              Therefore, an influence of TDD radio communication between the
   base station and the terminal device may be suppressed and as many D2D resources
   as possible may be ensured.
   [0155]
10 (b-2) Second example
   When the UL/DL configuration is a first configuration, the D2D resources
   appropriate for the UL/DL configuration may be radio resources of an uplink
   subframe of a first number and may be periodic radio resources that are repeated at a
   first period.             On the other hand, when the UL/DL configuration is a second
15 configuration, the D2D resources appropriate for the UL/DL configuration may be
   radio resources of an uplink subframe of a second number that is less than the first
   number and may be periodic radio resources that are repeated at a second period that
   is shorter than the first period.
   [0156]
20 That is, the D2D resources have a longer period when the radio resources have a
   greater number of uplink subframes, and have a shorter period when the radio
   resources have a smaller number of uplink subframes.               A specific example of the
   period for each configuration will be described below with reference to FIG. 19.
   [0157]
25 FIG. 19 is an explanatory diagram illustrating a second example of the period for
   each configuration.                 Referring to FIG. 19, periods and subframes of seven
   configurations               (configurations  0 to 6) are illustrated.   For example,    the
   configurations 0, 1, and 6 include four or more uplink subframes, and the D2D
   resources appropriate for each of the configurations 0, 1, and 6 are radio resources of
30 two uplink subframes and have a period of 400 ms (that is, 40 radio frames).              In
   addition, the configurations 2, 3, 4, and 5 include three or fewer uplink subframes,
   10324969_1(GHMatters)P103669.AU.1

                                              38
   and the D2D resources appropriate for each of the configurations 2, 3, 4, and 5 are
   radio resources of one uplink subframe and have a period of 200 ms (that is, 20 radio
   frames).
   [0158]
 5 Accordingly, for example, when the number of uplink subframes of the configuration
   is small, the D2D resources are radio resources in which a small number of uplink
   subframes are included in the radio frame and that have a shorter period.   Therefore,
   in an individual radio frame, an influence of TDD radio communication between the
   base station and the terminal device may be suppressed and a difference of amounts
10 of the D2D resources between configurations may decrease.
   [0159]
   <<6. Process Flow>>
   Next, process examples of embodiments of the present disclosure will be described
   with reference to FIGS. 20 to 22.
15 [0160]
   (First example)
   FIG. 20 is a sequence diagram schematically illustrating a first example of a process
   flow according to the embodiment of the present disclosure.
   [0161]
20 The base station 100 reports system information indicating the first configuration as
   the UL/DL configuration of the TDD carrier (S401).        In addition, the base station
   100 reports system information indicating the D2D resources appropriate for the first
   configuration (S403).
   [0162]
25 The terminal device 200 uses the D2D resources (that is, the D2D resources
   appropriate for the first configuration) of which the base station 100 has notified the
   terminal device 200, and performs D2D communication (S405).
   [0163]
   Then, the base station 100 determines changing of the UL/DL configuration of the
30 TDD carrier from the first configuration to the second configuration, and reports
   system information indicating the second configuration as the UL/DL configuration
   10324969_1(GHMatters)P103669.AU.1

                                                   39
   (S407).         In addition, the base station 100 reports system information indicating the
   D2D resources appropriate for the second configuration (S409).
   [0164]
   The terminal device 200 uses the D2D resources (that is, the D2D resources
 5 appropriate for the second configuration) of which the base station 100 has notified
   the terminal device 200, and performs D2D communication (S411).
   [0165]
   (Second example)
   FIG. 21 is a sequence diagram schematically illustrating a second example of a
10 process flow according to the embodiment of the present disclosure.
   [0166]
   The base station 100 reports system information indicating the first configuration as
   the UL/DL configuration of the TDD carrier (S421).                In addition, the base station
   100 reports system information indicating the D2D resources appropriate for each of
15 the multiple configurations (S423).          Especially, in this example, the base station 100
   reports system information indicating the D2D resources for each configuration
   included in the multiple configurations.
   [0167]
   The terminal device 200 uses the D2D resources appropriate for the first
20 configuration among the D2D resources appropriate for each of the multiple
   configurations and performs D2D communication (S425).
   [0168]
   Then, the base station 100 determines changing of the UL/DL configuration of the
   TDD carrier from the first configuration to the second configuration, and reports
25 system information indicating the second configuration as the UL/DL configuration
   (S427).
   [0169]
   The terminal device 200 uses the D2D resources appropriate for the second
   configuration among the D2D resources appropriate for each of the multiple
30 configurations and performs D2D communication (S429).

   (Third example)
   FIG. 22 is a sequence diagram schematically illustrating a third example of a process
   flow according to the embodiment of the present disclosure.
   [0171]
 5 The base station 100 reports system information indicating the first configuration as
   the UL/DL configuration of the TDD carrier (S441).           In addition, the base station
   100 reports system information indicating the D2D resources appropriate for each of
   the multiple configurations (S443).     Especially, in this example, the base station 100
   reports system information indicating the radio resources of the uplink subframe
10 common among the multiple configurations.             Further, for example, the radio
   resources may be the D2D resources (that is, the D2D resources whose subframe,
   period and offset are common among the multiple configurations) common among
   the multiple configurations.
   [0172]
15 The terminal device 200 uses the D2D resources (that is, the D2D resources common
   among the multiple configurations) of which the base station 100 has notified the
   terminal device 200 and performs D2D communication (S445).
   [0173]
   Also, for example, the base station 100 then changes the UL/DL configuration of the
20 TDD carrier from the first configuration to the second configuration.       Regardless of
   this change, the terminal device 200 continuously uses the D2D resources (that is, the
   D2D resources common among the multiple configurations) and performs D2D
   communication.
   [0174]
25 <<7. Applications>>
   Technology according to one or more of the embodiments of the present disclosure is
   applicable to various products.     A base station 100 may be realized as any type of
   evolved Node B (eNB) such as a macro eNB, and a small eNB.              A small eNB may
   be an eNB that covers a cell smaller than a macro cell, such as a pico eNB, micro
30 eNB, or home (femto) eNB.         Instead, the base station 100 may be realized as any
   other types of base stations such as a NodeB and a base transceiver station (BTS).
   10324969_1(GHMatters)P103669.AU.1

                                                      41
   The base station 100 may include a main body (that is also referred to as a base
   station device) configured to control radio communication, and one or more remote
   radio heads (RRH) disposed in a different place from the main body.             Additionally,
   various types of terminals to be discussed later may also operate as the base station
 5 100 by temporarily or semi-permanently executing a base station function.           Further,
   at least some of structural elements of the base station 100 may be realized in the
   base station device or in a module for the base station device.
   [0175]
   For example, the terminal device 200 may be realized as a mobile terminal such as a
10 smartphone, a tablet personal computer (PC), a notebook PC, a portable game
   terminal, a portable/dongle type mobile router, and a digital camera, or an in-vehicle
   terminal such as a car navigation device.               The terminal device 200 may also be
   realized as a terminal (that is also referred to as a machine type communication
   (MTC) terminal)                   that performs machine-to-machine   (M2M)   communication.
15 Furthermore, at least some of structural elements of the terminal device 200 may be a
   module (such as an integrated circuit module including a single die) mounted on each
   of the terminals.
   [0176]
   <7.1. Application related to Base Station>
20 (First Application)
   FIG. 23 is a block diagram illustrating a first example of a schematic configuration of
   an eNB to which an embodiment of the technology of the present disclosure may be
   applied.         An eNB 800 includes one or more antennas 810 and a base station device
   820.       Each antenna 810 and the base station device 820 may be connected to each
25 other via an RF cable.
   [0177]
   Each of the antennas 810 includes a single or multiple antenna elements (such as
   multiple antenna elements included in an MIMO antenna), and is used for the base
   station device 820 to transmit and receive radio signals.           The eNB 800 may include
30 the multiple antennas 810, as illustrated in FIG. 23.              For example, the multiple
   antennas 810 may be compatible with multiple frequency bands used by the eNB 800.
   10324969_1(GHMatters)P103669.AU.1

                                                      42
   Although FIG. 23 illustrates the example in which the eNB 800 includes the multiple
   antennas 810, the eNB 800 may also include a single antenna 810.
   [0178]
   The base station device 820 includes a controller 821, a memory 822, a network
 5 interface 823, and a radio communication interface 825.
   [0179]
   The controller 821 may be, for example, a CPU or a DSP, and operates various
   functions of a higher layer of the base station device 820.                  For example, the
   controller 821 generates a data packet from data in signals processed by the radio
10 communication interface 825, and transfers the generated packet via the network
   interface 823.                The controller 821 may bundle data from multiple base band
   processors to generate the bundled packet, and transfer the generated bundled packet.
   The controller 821 may have logical functions of performing control such as radio
   resource control, radio bearer control, mobility management, admission control, and
15 scheduling.             The control may be performed in corporation with an eNB or a core
   network node in the vicinity.              The memory 822 includes RAM and ROM, and stores
   a program that is executed by the controller 821, and various types of control data
   (such as a terminal list, transmission power data, and scheduling data).
   [0180]
20 The network interface 823 is a communication interface for connecting the base
   station device 820 to a core network 824.              The controller 821 may communicate
   with a core network node or another eNB via the network interface 823.                  In that
   case, the eNB 800, and the core network node or the other eNB may be connected to
   each other through a logical interface (such as an SI interface and an X2 interface).
25 The network interface 823 may also be a wired communication interface or a radio
   communication interface for radio backhaul.             If the network interface 823 is a radio
   communication interface, the network interface 823 may use a higher frequency band
   for radio communication than a frequency band used by the radio communication
   interface 825.
30 [0181]
   The radio communication interface 825 supports any cellular communication scheme
   10324969_1(GHMatters)P103669.AU.1

                                                      43
   such as Long Term Evolution (LTE) and LTE-Advanced, and provides radio
   connection to a terminal positioned in a cell of the eNB 800 via the antenna 810.
   The radio communication interface 825 may typically include, for example, a
   baseband (BB) processor 826 and an RF circuit 827.                 The BB processor 826 may
 5 perform,            for       example,  encoding/decoding,     modulating/demodulating,      and
   multiplexing/demultiplexing, and performs various types of signal processing of
   layers (such as LI, medium access control (MAC), radio link control (RLC), and a
   packet data convergence protocol (PDCP)).               The BB processor 826 may have a part
   or all of the above-described logical functions instead of the controller 821.               The
10 BB processor 826 may be a memory that stores a communication control program, or
   a module that includes a processor and a related circuit configured to execute the
   program.            Updating the program may allow the functions of the BB processor 826
   to be changed.                The module may be a card or a blade that is inserted into a slot of
   the base station device 820.             Alternatively, the module may also be a chip that is
15 mounted on the card or the blade.             Meanwhile, the RF circuit 827 may include, for
   example, a mixer, a filter, and an amplifier, and transmits and receives radio signals
   via the antenna 810.
   [0182]
   The radio communication interface 825 may include the multiple BB processors 826,
20 as illustrated in FIG. 23.             For example, the multiple BB processors 826 may be
   compatible with multiple frequency bands used by the eNB 800.                         The radio
   communication interface 825 may include the multiple RF circuits 827, as illustrated
   in FIG. 23.              For example, the multiple RF circuits 827 may be compatible with
   multiple antenna elements.              Although FIG. 23 illustrates the example in which the
25 radio communication interface 825 includes the multiple BB processors 826 and the
   multiple RF circuits 827, the radio communication interface 825 may also include a
   single BB processor 826 or a single RF circuit 827.

   or the entire radio communication interface 825 and/or the controller 821, and the
   control unit 153 (and the information acquisition unit 151) may be implemented in

   program causing the processor to execute operations of the control unit 153 (and the
   information acquisition unit 151)) causing the processor to function as the control
   unit 153 (and the information acquisition unit 151), and execute the program.                As
   another example, a program causing the processor to function as the control unit 153
10 (and the information acquisition unit 151) may be installed in the eNB 800, and the
   radio communication interface 825 (for example, the BB processor 826) and/or the
   controller 821 may execute the program.               As described above, as a device including
   the control unit 153 (and the information acquisition unit 151), the eNB 800, the base
   station device 820 or the module may be provided.                      A program causing the

20 described with reference to FIG. 10 may be implemented in the radio communication
   interface 825 (for example, the RF circuit 827).              In addition, the antenna unit 110
   may be implemented in the antenna 810.                 In addition, the network communication
   unit 130 may be implemented in the controller 821 and/or the network interface 823.

   FIG. 24 is a block diagram illustrating a second example of a schematic
   configuration of an eNB to which an embodiment of the technology of the present
   disclosure may be applied.             An eNB 830 includes one or more antennas 840, a base
   station device 850, and an RRH 860.                Each antenna 840 and the RRH 860 may be

   Each of the antennas 840 includes a single or multiple antenna elements (such as
   multiple antenna elements included in an MIMO antenna), and is used for the RRH
 5 860 to transmit and receive radio signals.            The eNB 830 may include the multiple
   antennas 840, as illustrated in FIG. 24.             For example, the multiple antennas 840
   may be compatible with multiple frequency bands used by the eNB 830.               Although
   FIG. 24 illustrates the example in which the eNB 830 includes the multiple antennas
   840, the eNB 830 may also include a single antenna 840.
10 [0187]
   The base station device 850 includes a controller 851, a memory 852, a network
   interface 853, a radio communication interface 855, and a connection interface 857.

   the controller 821, the memory 822, and the network interface 823 described with
15 reference to FIG. 23.
   [0188]
   The radio communication interface 855 supports any cellular communication scheme
   such as LTE and LTE-Advanced, and provides radio communication to a terminal
   positioned in a sector corresponding to the RRH 860 via the RRH 860 and the
20 antenna 840.               The radio communication interface 855 may typically include, for
   example, a BB processor 856.                 The BB processor 856 is the same as the BB
   processor 826 described with reference to FIG. 23, except the BB processor 856 is
   connected to the RF circuit 864 of the RRH 860 via the connection interface 857.
   The radio communication interface 855 may include the multiple BB processors 856,
25 as illustrated in FIG. 24.             For example, the multiple BB processors 856 may be
   compatible with multiple frequency bands used by the eNB 830.              Although FIG. 24
   illustrates the example in which the radio communication interface 855 includes the
   multiple BB processors 856, the radio communication interface 855 may also include
   a single BB processor 856.

   illustrated in FIG. 24.               For example, the multiple RF circuits 864 may support
20 multiple antenna elements.               Although FIG. 24 illustrates the example in which the

   controls functions of an application layer and another layer of the smartphone 900.
   The memory 902 includes RAM and ROM, and stores a program that is executed by
   the processor 901, and data.                 The storage 903 may include a storage medium such
   as a semiconductor memory and a hard disk.                  The external connection interface 904
 5 is an interface for connecting an external device such as a memory card and a
   universal serial bus (USB) device to the smartphone 900.
   [0197]
   The camera 906 includes an image sensor such as a charge coupled device (CCD)
   and a complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS), and generates a captured
10 image.        The sensor 907 may include a group of sensors such as a measurement

   smartphone 900.                   The speaker 911 converts audio signals that are output from the
   smartphone 900 to sounds.

   The radio communication interface 912 supports any cellular communication scheme
   such as LTE and LTE-Advanced, and performs radio communication.                         The radio
   communication interface 912 may typically include, for example, a BB processor

   communication interface 933 may typically include, for example, a BB processor
   934 and an RF circuit 935.               The BB processor 934 may perform, for example,
   encoding/decoding, modulating/demodulating, and multiplexing/demultiplexing, and
   performs various types of signal processing for radio communication.            Meanwhile,
 5 the RF circuit 935 may include, for example, a mixer, a filter, and an amplifier, and
   transmits and receives radio signals via the antenna 937.         The radio communication
   interface 933 may be a one chip module having the BB processor 934 and the RF
   circuit 935 integrated thereon.           The radio communication interface 933 may include
   the multiple BB processors 934 and the multiple RF circuits 935, as illustrated in FIG.
10 26.      Although FIG. 26 illustrates the example in which the radio communication
   interface 933 includes the multiple BB processors 934 and the multiple RF circuits
   935, the radio communication interface 933 may also include a single BB processor
   934 or a single RF circuit 935.
   [0211]
15 Furthermore,              in addition to   a cellular  communication    scheme,  the  radio
   communication interface 933 may support another type of radio communication
   scheme such as a short-distance wireless communication scheme, a near field
   communication scheme, and a radio LAN scheme.                      In that case, the radio
   communication interface 933 may include the BB processor 934 and the RF circuit
20 935 for each radio communication scheme.
   [0212]
   Each of the antenna switches 936 switches connection destinations of the antennas
   937 among multiple circuits (such as circuits for different radio communication
   schemes) included in the radio communication interface 933.
25 [0213]
   Each of the antennas 937 includes a single or multiple antenna elements (such as
   multiple antenna elements included in an MIMO antenna), and is used for the radio
   communication interface 933 to transmit and receive radio signals.                 The car
   navigation device 920 may include the multiple antennas 937, as illustrated in FIG.
30 26.      Although FIG. 26 illustrates the example in which the car navigation device
   920 includes the multiple antennas 937, the car navigation device 920 may also

   include a single antenna 937.
   [0214]
   Furthermore, the car navigation device 920 may include the antenna 937 for each
   radio communication scheme.               In that case, the antenna switches 936 may be
 5 omitted from the configuration of the car navigation device 920.
   [0215]
   The battery 938 supplies power to blocks of the car navigation device 920 illustrated
   in FIG. 26 via feeder lines that are partially shown as dashed lines in the figure.
   The battery 938 accumulates power supplied form the vehicle.
10 [0216]

   unit 241 and the control unit 243 described with reference to FIG. 11 may be
   implemented in the radio communication interface 933.             Alternatively, at least some
   of these components may also be implemented in the processor 921.              As an example,
15 the car navigation device 920 may mount a module including a part (for example, the
   BB processor 934) or the entire radio communication interface 933 and/or the
   processor 921, and the information acquisition unit 241 and the control unit 243 may
   be implemented in the module.              In this case, the module may store a program (in
   other words, a program causing the processor to execute operations of the
20 information acquisition unit 241 and the control unit 243) causing the processor to
   function as the information acquisition unit 241 and the control unit 243, and execute
   the program.              As another example, a program causing the processor to function as
   the information acquisition unit 241 and the control unit 243 may be installed in the
   car navigation device 920, and the radio communication interface 933 (for example,
25 the BB processor 934) and/or the processor 921 may execute the program.                     As
   described above, as a device including the information acquisition unit 241 and the
   control unit 243, the car navigation device 920 or the module may be provided.               A

   <<8. Conclusion>>
   Respective devices and respective processes according to the embodiments of the
15 present disclosure have been described above with reference to FIGS. 1 to 26.
   [0220]
   According to the embodiment of the present disclosure, the base station 100 includes
   the control unit 153 configured to dynamically change the UL/DL configuration of
   the TDD carrier.                  The control unit 153 notifies the terminal device of the radio
20 resources for D2D communication appropriate for the UL/DL configuration.                    The
   radio resources are the radio resources of at least one uplink subframe of the UL/DL
   configuration.
   [0221]
   In addition, according to the embodiment of the present disclosure, the information
25 acquisition unit 241 configured to acquire information indicating the radio resources
   for D2D communication appropriate for the UL/DL configuration of the TDD carrier
   that is dynamically changed by the base station 100 and the control unit 243
   configured to control D2D communication using the radio resources are included.
   The radio resources are radio resources of at least one uplink subframe of the UL/DL
30 configuration.

                                                          55
   Accordingly, for example, the terminal device can appropriately perform D2D
   communication under the TDD environment.
   [0223]
   It should be understood by those skilled in the art that various modifications,
 5 combinations, sub-combinations and alterations may occur depending on design
   requirements and other factors insofar as they are within the scope of the appended
   claims or the equivalents thereof.
   [0224]
   For example, while the first technical features and the second technical features have
10 been described, the first technical features and the second technical features not have
   to be used in conjunction.
   [0225]
   For example, the first technical features may be used without using the second
   technical features.
15 [0226]
   For example, the second technical features may be used without using the first
   technical features.               In this case, the UL/DL configuration of the TDD carrier may
   not be dynamically changed.                    As an example, the base station (the information
   acquisition unit) may acquire information indicating the D2D resources appropriate
20 for the UL/DL configuration (it is not dynamically changed).                  Therefore, the base
   station (the control unit) may notify the terminal device of the D2D resources.                The
   D2D resources may be the radio resources of at least one uplink subframe of the
   UL/DL configuration.                  Therefore, the second technical features (that is, any of the
   second technical features) may be applied to the D2D resources.
25 [0227]
   For example, the example in which the communication system is a system compliant
   with LTE, LTE-Advanced, or communication standards conforming thereto has been
   described, but the present disclosure is not limited to the example.              For example, the
   communication system may be a system compliant with other communication
30 standards.

   Also, the processing steps in a process in this specification are not strictly limited to
   being executed in a time series following the sequence described in a flowchart.
   For example, the processing steps in a process may be executed in a sequence that
   differs from a sequence described herein as a flowchart, and furthermore may be
 5 executed in parallel.

   In addition, a computer program (in other words, a computer program causing the
   processor to execute operations of components of the device) causing the processor
   (for example, the CPU and the DSP) included in devices (for example, the base
10 station, the base station device for the base station, or a module for the base station
   device, or the terminal device or the module for the terminal device) of this
   specification to function as components (for example, the information acquisition
   unit and/or the control unit) of the device can be created.     In addition, a recording
   medium in which the computer program is recorded may be provided.            In addition,
15 a device (for example, a finished product or a module (for example, a component, a
   processing circuit or a chip) for the finished product) including a memory in which
   the computer program is stored and one or more processors capable of executing the
   computer program may be provided.         In addition, a method including operations of
   components (for example, the information acquisition unit and/or the control unit) of
20 the device may be included in the embodiments of the technology according to the
   present disclosure.
   [0230]
   In addition, the effects described in the present specification are merely illustrative
   and demonstrative, and not limitative.      In other words, the technology according to
25 the present disclosure can exhibit other effects that are evident to those skilled in the
   art along with or instead of the effects based on the present specification.
