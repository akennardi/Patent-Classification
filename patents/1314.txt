                                             ABSTRACT
5         In the present embodiments, offering credits for gaming machine play in excess of the cash
  used to purchase the credits may incentivize various player behaviors. Such behaviors may include
  remote enrollment in the player-tracking system-and payment for the credits-via a web browser;
  wagering a minimum amount; and wagering within a predefined time period.

                                             BACKGROUND
  0         This disclosure relates generally to gaming devices and more particularly to incentives
    offered by a proprietor of a gaming establishment to induce enrolment in a player-tracking
    system and play of the gaming devices.
            Throughout this specification, unless the context requires otherwise, the word "comprise"
    and variations such as "comprises", "comprising" and "comprised" are to be understood to imply
  5 the presence of a stated integer or group of integers but not the exclusion of any other integer or
    group of integers.
    Throughout this specification, unless the context requires otherwise, the word "include" and
    variations such as "includes", "including" and "included" are to be understood to imply the
    presence of a stated integer or group of integers but not the exclusion of any other integer or
 !0 group of integers.
             The discussion of the background art, any reference to a document and any reference to
    information that is known, which is contained in this specification, is provided only for the
    purpose of facilitating an understanding of the background art to the present invention, and is not
    an acknowledgement or admission that any of that material forms part of the common general
 !5 knowledge in Australia or any other country as at the priority date of the application in relation
    to which this specification has been filed.
            Use of a web browser to permit off-site enrollment of players in a player-tracking system
    via a web browser is known in the prior art. Manual promotions in which players pay, e.g., $20
    cash for $40 credit are also known.
30          In these prior art promotions an attendant oversees a desk associated with a bank of
    gaming machines dedicated to the promotion. The attendant receives cash from the player, and,
    using controls at the desk, applies those credits to a specified machine, which the player must
    play until the session ends-typically either as a result of playing all the credits or hitting a large
    jackpot. This is so because the $40 credit cannot be cashed out, and can be used only to play the
                                                      1

   specified gaming machine. In addition, only the top 3 awards can be cashed out; all smaller
   awards are applied to the gaming machine as non-cashable credits that can only be wagered.

                                       DETAILED DESCRIPTION
           FIGs. 1A and 1B illustrate example gaming devices according to embodiments of the
   invention.
 0         Referring to FIGs. 1A and IB, a gaming device 10 is an electronic gaming machine.
   Although an electronic gaming machine or "slot" machine is illustrated, various other types of
   devices may be used to wager monetarily based credits on a game of chance in accordance with
   principles of the invention. The term "electronic gaming device" is meant to include various
   devices such as electro-mechanical spinning-reel type slot machines, video slot machines, and
25 video poker machines, for instance. Other gaming devices may include computer-based gaming
   machines, wireless gaming devices, multi-player gaming stations, modified personal electronic
   gaming devices (such as cell phones), personal computers, server-based gaming terminals, and
   other similar devices. Although embodiments of the invention will work with all of the gaming
   types mentioned, for ease of illustration the present embodiments will be described in reference to
30 the electronic gaming machine 10 shown in FIGs. 1A and lB.
                                                       1)    ~     Attcnrng'j Dcw1,nf NTc 1.1-%1 _101

            The gaming device 10 includes a cabinet 15 housing components to operate the gaming
   device 10. The cabinet 15 may include a gaming display 20, a base portion 13, a top box 18, and a
   player interface panel 30. The gaming display 20 may include mechanical spinning reels (FIG.
   2A), a video display (FIGs. 2B and 2C), or a combination of both spinning reels and a video
 5 display (not shown). The gaming cabinet 15 may also include a credit meter 27 and a coin-in or
   bet meter 28. The credit meter 27 may indicate the total number of credits remaining on the
   gaming device 10 that are eligible to be wagered. In some embodiments, the credit meter 27 may
   reflect a monetary unit, such as dollars. However, it is often preferable to have the credit meter 27
   reflect a number of 'credits,' rather than a monetary unit. The bet meter 28 may indicate the
 0 amount of credits to be wagered on a particular game. Thus, for each game, the player transfers
   the amount that he or she wants to wager from the credit meter 27 to the bet meter 28. In some
   embodiments, various other meters may be present, such as meters reflecting amounts won,
   amounts paid, or the like. In embodiments where the gaming display 20 is a video monitor, the
   information indicated on the credit meters may be shown on the gaming display itself 20 (FIG.
 5 2B).
            The base portion 13 may include a lighted panel 14, a coin return (not shown), and a
   gaming handle 12 operable on a partially rotating pivot joint 11. The game handle 12 is
   traditionally included on mechanical spinning-reel games, where the handle may be pulled toward
   a player to initiate the spinning of reels 22 after placement of a wager. The top box 18 may include
 0 a lighted panel 17, a video display (such as an LCD monitor), a mechanical bonus device (not
   shown), and a candle light indicator 19. The player interface panel 30 may include various devices
   so that a player can interact with the gaming device 10.
            The player interface panel 30 may include one or more game buttons 32 that can be
   actuated by the player to cause the gaming device 10 to perform a specific action. For example,
25 some of the game buttons 32 may cause the gaming device 10 to bet a credit to be wagered during
   the next game, change the number of lines being played on a multi-line game, cash out the credits
   remaining on the gaming device (as indicated on the credit meter 27), or request assistance from
   casino personnel, such as by lighting the candle 19. In addition, the player interface panel 30 may
   include one or more game actuating buttons 33. The game actuating buttons 33 may initiate a
30 game with a pre-specified amount of credits. On some gaming devices 10 a "Max Bet" game
   actuating button 33 may be included that places the maximum credit wager on a game and initiates
                                                                     Attcnrng'j Dcw1,nf NTcn 1.1-%1 _101

    the game. The player interface panel 30 may further include a bill acceptor 37 and a ticket printer
    38. The bill acceptor 37 may accept and validate paper money or previously printed tickets with a
    credit balance. The ticket printer 38 may print out tickets reflecting the balance of the credits that
    remain on the gaming device 10 when a player cashes out by pressing one of the game buttons 32
  5 programmed to cause a 'cashout.' These tickets may be inserted into other gaming machines or
    redeemed at a cashier station or kiosk for cash.
            The gaming device 10 may also include one or more speakers 26 to transmit auditory
    information or sounds to the player. The auditory information may include specific sounds
    associated with particular events that occur during game play on the gaming device 10. For
  0 example, a particularly festive sound may be played during a large win or when a bonus is
    triggered. The speakers 26 may also transmit "attract" sounds to entice nearby players when the
    game is not currently being played.
            The gaming device 10 may further include a secondary display 25.       This secondary display
    25 may be a vacuum fluorescent display (VFD), a liquid crystal display (LCD), a cathode ray tube
  5 (CRT), a plasma screen, or the like. The secondary display 25 may show any combination of
    primary game information and ancillary information to the player. For example, the secondary
    display 25 may show player tracking information, secondary bonus information, advertisements, or
    player selectable game options.
            The gaming device 10 may include a separate information window (not shown) dedicated
 !0 to supplying any combination of information related to primary game play, secondary bonus
    information, player tracking information, secondary bonus information, advertisements or player
    selectable game options. This window may be fixed in size and location or may have its size and
    location vary temporally as communication needs change. One example of such a resizable
    window is International Game Technology's "service window". Another example is Las Vegas
25  Gaming Incorporated's retrofit technology which allows information to be placed over areas of the
    game or the secondary display screen at various times and in various situations.
            The gaming device 10 includes a microprocessor 40 that controls operation of the gaming
    device 10. If the gaming device 10 is a standalone gaming device, the microprocessor 40 may
    control virtually all of the operations of the gaming devices and attached equipment, such as
30  operating game logic stored in memory (not shown) as firmware, controlling the display 20 to
    represent the outcome of a game, communicating with the other peripheral devices (such as the bill
                                                     A               Attcnrng'j Dcw1,nf NTcn  12.'1-%1
                                                                                                     001

   acceptor 37), and orchestrating the lighting and sound emanating from the gaming device 10. In
   other embodiments where the gaming device 10 is coupled to a network 50, as described below,
   the microprocessor 40 may have different tasks depending on the setup and function of the gaming
   device. For example, the microprocessor 40 may be responsible for running the base game of the
 5 gaming device and executing instructions received over the network 50 from a bonus server or
   player tracking server. In a server-based gaming setup, the microprocessor 40 may act as a
   terminal to execute instructions from a remote server that is running game play on the gaming
   device.
            The microprocessor 40 may be coupled to a machine communication interface (MCI) 42
 0 that connects the gaming device 10 to a gaming network 50. The MCI 42 may be coupled to the
   microprocessor 40 through a serial connection, a parallel connection, an optical connection, or in
   some cases a wireless connection. The gaming device 10 may include memory 41 (MEM), such
   as a random access memory (RAM), coupled to the microprocessor 40 and which can be used to
   store gaming information, such as storing total coin-in statistics about a present or past gaming
 5 session, which can be communicated to a remote server or database through the MCI 42. The
   MCI 42 may also facilitate communication between the network 50 and the secondary display 25
   or a player tracking unit 45 housed in the gaming cabinet 15.
            The player tracking unit 45 may include an identification device 46 and one or more
   buttons 47 associated with the player tracking unit 45. The identification device 46 serves to
 0 identify a player, by, for example, reading a player-tracking device, such as a player tracking card
   that is issued by the casino to individual players who choose to have such a card. The
   identification device 46 may instead, or additionally, identify players through other methods.
   Player tracking systems using player tracking cards and card readers 46 are known in the art.
   Briefly summarizing such a system, a player registers with the casino prior to commencing
25 gaming. The casino issues a unique player-tracking card to the player and opens a corresponding
   player account that is stored on a server or host computer, described below with reference to
   FIG. 3. The player account may include the player's name and mailing address and other
   information of interest to the casino in connection with marketing efforts. Prior to playing one of
   the gaming devices in the casino, the player inserts the player tracking card into the identification
30 device 46 thus permitting the casino to track player activity, such as amounts wagered, credits
   won, and rate of play.
                                                                   AAttnrn'j' flnnlrrNT~n  111   0905r

             To induce the player to use the card and be an identified player, the casino may award
    each player points proportional to the money or credits wagered by the player. Players typically
    accrue points at a rate related to the amount wagered, although other factors may cause the
    casino to award the player various amounts. The points may be displayed on the secondary
  5 display 25 or using other methods. In conventional player tracking systems, the player may take
    his or her card to a special desk in the casino where a casino employee scans the card to
    determine how many accrued points are in the player's account. The player may redeem points
    for selected merchandise, meals in casino restaurants, or the like, which each have assigned point
    values. In some player tracking systems, the player may use the secondary display 25 to access
  0 their player tracking account, such as to check a total number of points, redeem points for various
    services, make changes to their account, or download promotional credits to the gaming device 10.
    In other embodiments, the identification device 46 may read other identifying cards (such as driver
    licenses, credit cards, etc.) to identify a player and match them to a corresponding player tracking
    account. Although FIG. 1A shows the player tracking unit 45 with a card reader as the
  5 identification device 46, other embodiments may include a player tracking unit 45 with a biometric
    scanner, PIN code acceptor, or other methods of identifying a player to pair the player with their
    player tracking account.
             During typical play on a gaming device 10, a player plays a game by placing a wager and
    then initiating a gaming session. The player may initially insert monetary bills or previously
 !0 printed tickets with a credit value into the bill acceptor 37. The player may also put coins into a
    coin acceptor (not shown) or a credit, debit or casino account card into a card reader/authorizer
    (not shown). In other embodiments, stored player points or special 'bonus points' awarded to the
    player or accumulated and/or stored in a player account may be able to be substituted at or
    transferred to the gaming device 10 for credits or other value. For example, a player may
25  convert stored loyalty points to credits or transfer funds from his bank account, credit card,
    casino account or other source of funding. The selected source of funding may be selected by the
    player at time of transfer, determined by the casino at the time of transfer or occur automatically
    according to a predefined selection process. One of skill in the art will readily see that this
    invention is useful with all gambling devices, regardless of the manner in which wager value
30  input is accomplished.
                                                      A              Attcnrng'j  Dcw1,nf NTcn 12.'1'-%1
                                                                                                      001

             The credit meter 27 displays the numeric credit value of the money or other value
    inserted, transferred, or stored dependent on the denomination of the gaming device 10. That is,
    if the gaming device 10 is a nickel slot machine and a $20 bill inserted into the bill acceptor 37,
    the credit meter will reflect 400 credits or one credit for each nickel of the inserted twenty
  5 dollars. For gaming devices 10 that support multiple denominations, the credit meter 27 will
    reflect the amount of credits relative to the denomination selected. Thus, in the above example,
    if a penny denomination is selected after the $20 is inserted the credit meter will change from
    400 credits to 2000 credits.
             A wager may be placed by pushing one or more of the game buttons 32, which may be
  0 reflected on the bet meter 28. That is, the player can generally depress a "bet one" button (one of
    the buttons on the player interface panel 30, such as 32), which transfers one credit from the
    credit meter 27 to the bet meter 28. Each time the button 32 is depressed an additional single
    credit transfers to the bet meter 28 up to a maximum bet that can be placed on a single play of
    the electronic gaming device 10. The gaming session may be initiated by pulling the gaming
  5 handle 12 or depressing the spin button 33. On some gaming devices 10, a "max bet" button
    (another one of the buttons 32 on the player interface panel 30) may be depressed to wager the
    maximum number of credits supported by the gaming device 10 and initiate a gaming session.
             If the gaming session does not result in any winning combination, the process of placing
    a wager may be repeated by the player. Alternatively, the player may cash out any remaining
 !0 credits on the credit meter 27 by depressing the "cash-out" button (another button 32 on the
    player interface panel 30), which causes the credits on the credit meter 27 to be paid out in the
    form of a ticket through the ticket printer 38, or may be paid out in the form of returning coins
    from a coin hopper (not shown) to a coin return tray.
             If instead a winning combination (win) appears on the display 20, the award
25  corresponding to the winning combination is immediately applied to the credit meter 27. For
    example, if the gaming device 10 is a slot machine, a winning combination of symbols 23 may
    land on a played payline on reels 22. If any bonus games are initiated, the gaming device 10
    may enter into a bonus mode or simply award the player with a bonus amount of credits that are
    applied to the credit meter 27.
30           FIGs. 2A to 2C illustrate exemplary types of gaming devices according to embodiments of
    the invention. FIG. 2A illustrates an example spinning-reel gaming machine 1OA, FIG. 2B
                                                    7               Attcnrng'j  Dcw1,nf NTcn 1.1-%1 _101

    illustrates an example video slot machine 1OB, and FIG. 2C illustrates an example video poker
    machine 1OC.
             Referring to FIG. 2A, a spinning-reel gaming machine 1OA includes a gaming display 20A
    having a plurality of mechanical spinning reels 22A. Typically, spinning-reel gaming machines
  5 10A have three to five spinning reels 22A. Each of the spinning reels 22A has multiple symbols
    23A that may be separated by blank areas on the spinning reels 22A, although the presence of
    blank areas typically depends on the number of reels 22A present in the gaming device 1OA and
    the number of different symbols 23A that may appear on the spinning reels 22A. Each of the
    symbols 22A or blank areas makes up a "stop" on the spinning reel 22A where the reel 22A comes
  0 to rest after a spin. Although the spinning reels 22A of various games 1OA may have various
    numbers of stops, many conventional spinning-reel gaming devices 1OA have reels 22A with
    twenty two stops.
             During game play, the spinning reels 22A may be controlled by stepper motors (not shown)
    under the direction of the microprocessor 40 (FIG. 1A). Thus, although the spinning-reel gaming
  5 device 10A has mechanical based spinning reels 22A, the movement of the reels themselves is
    electronically controlled to spin and stop. This electronic control is advantageous because it allows
    a virtual reel strip to be stored in the memory 41 of the gaming device 1OA, where various "virtual
    stops" are mapped to each physical stop on the physical reel 22A. This mapping allows the
    gaming device 1OA to establish greater awards and bonuses available to the player because of the
 !0 increased number of possible combinations afforded by the virtual reel strips.
             A gaming session on a spinning reel slot machine 1OA typically includes the player
    pressing the "bet-one" button (one of the game buttons 32A) to wager a desired number of credits
    followed by pulling the gaming handle 12 (FIGs. 1A, IB) or pressing the spin button 33A to spin
    the reels 22A. Alternatively, the player may simply press the "max-bet" button (another one of the
25  game buttons 32A) to both wager the maximum number of credits permitted and initiate the
    spinning of the reels 22A. The spinning reels 22A may all stop at the same time or may
    individually stop one after another (typically from left to right) to build player anticipation.
    Because the display 20A usually cannot be physically modified, some spinning reel slot machines
    1OA include an electronic display screen in the top box 18 (FIG. 1B), a mechanical bonus
30  mechanism in the top box 18, or a secondary display 25 (FIG. 1A) to execute a bonus.
                                                        52     ~     Attcnrng'j   Dcw1,nf NTc  1.1-%1 _101

             Referring to FIG. 2B, a video gaming machine 1OB may include a video display 20B to
    display virtual spinning reels 22B and various other gaming information 21B. The video display
    20B may be a CRT, LCD, plasma screen, or the like. It is usually preferable that the video display
    20B be a touchscreen to accept player input. A number of symbols 23A appear on each of the
  5 virtual spinning reels 22B. Although FIG. 2B shows five virtual spinning reels 22B, the flexibility
    of the video display 20B allows for various reel 22B and game configurations. For example, some
    video slot games 1OB spin reels for each individual symbol position (or stop) that appears on the
    video display 20B. That is, each symbol position on the screen is independent of every other
    position during the gaming sessions. In these types of games, very large numbers of pay lines or
  0 multiple super scatter pays can be utilized since similar symbols could appear at every symbol
    position on the video display 20B. On the other hand, other video slot games 1OB more closely
    resemble the mechanical spinning reel games where symbols that are vertically adjacent to each
    other are part of the same continuous virtual spinning reel 22B.
             Because the virtual spinning reels 22B, by virtue of being computer implemented, can have
  5 almost any number of stops on a reel strip, it is much easier to have a greater variety of displayed
    outcomes as compared to spinning-reel slot machines 1OA (FIG. 2A) that have a fixed number of
    physical stops on each spinning reel 22A.
             With the possible increases in reel 22B numbers and configurations over the mechanical
    gaming device 10A, video gaming devices 1OB often have multiple paylines 24 that may be
 !0 played. By having more paylines 24 available to play, the player may be more likely to have a
    winning combination when the reels 22B stop and the gaming session ends. However, since the
    player typically must wager at least a minimum number of credits to enable each payline 24 to be
    eligible for winning, the overall odds of winning are not much different, if at all, than if the player
    is wagering only on a single payline. For example, in a five line game, the player may bet one
25  credit per payline 24 and be eligible for winning symbol combinations that appear on any of the
    five played paylines 24. This gives a total of five credits wagered and five possible winning
    paylines 24. If, on the other hand, the player only wagers one credit on one payline 24, but plays
    five gaming sessions, the odds of winning would be identical as above: five credits wagered and
    five possible winning paylines 24.
30           Because the video display 20B can easily modify the image output by the video display
    20B, bonuses, such as second screen bonuses are relatively easy to award on the video slot game
                                                    0               Attcnrng'j  Dcw1,nf NTcn  1 '1-%1V001

   1OB. That is, if a bonus is triggered during game play, the video display 20B may simply store the
   resulting screen shot in memory and display a bonus sequence on the video display 20B. After the
   bonus sequence is completed, the video display 20B may then retrieve the previous screen shot and
   information from memory, and re-display that image.
 5          Also, as mentioned above, the video display 20B may allow various other game
   information 21B to be displayed. For example, as shown in FIG. 2B, banner information may be
   displayed above the spinning reels 22B to inform the player, perhaps, which symbol combination
   is needed to trigger a bonus. Also, instead of providing a separate credit meter 27 (FIG. 1A) and
   bet meter 28, the same information can instead be displayed on the video display 20B. In addition,
 0 "soft buttons" 29B such as a "spin" button or "help/see pays" button may be built using the touch
   screen video display 20B. Such customization and ease of changing the image shown on the
   display 20B adds to the flexibility of the game 1OB.
            Even with the improved flexibility afforded by the video display 20B, several physical
   buttons 32B and 33B are usually provided on video slot machines 1OB. These buttons may include
 5 game buttons 32B that allow a player to choose the number of paylines 24 he or she would like to
   play and the number of credits wagered on each payline 24. In addition, a max bet button (one of
   the game buttons 32B) allows a player to place a maximum credit wager on the maximum number
   of available paylines 24 and initiate a gaming session. A repeat bet or spin button 33B may also be
   used to initiate each gaming session when the max bet button is not used.
 0          Referring to FIG. 2C, a video poker gaming device 1OC may include a video display 20C
   that is physically similar to the video display 20B shown in FIG. 2B. The video display 20C may
   show a poker hand of five cards 23C and various other player information 21 C including a
   paytable for various winning hands, as well as a plurality of player selectable soft buttons 29C.
   The video display 20C may present a poker hand of five cards 23C and various other player
25 information 21C including a number of player selectable soft (touch-screen) buttons 29C and a
   paytable for various winning hands. Although the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 3C shows only
   one hand of poker on the video display 20C, various other video poker machines 1OC may show
   several poker hands (multi-hand poker). Typically, video poker machines 1OC play "draw" poker
   in which a player is dealt a hand of five cards, has the opportunity to hold any combination of those
30 five cards, and then draws new cards to replace the discarded ones. All pays are usually given for
   winning combinations resulting from the final hand, although some video poker games 1OC may
                                                    1)             A ++nrno-'e TnAlft No    1 '1 1 _01

    give bonus credits for certain combinations received on the first hand before the draw. In the
    example shown in FIG. 2C a player has been dealt two aces, a three, a six, and a nine. The video
    poker game 1OC may provide a bonus or payout for the player having been dealt the pair of aces,
    even before the player decides what to discard in the draw. Since pairs, three of a kind, etc. are
  5 typically needed for wins, a player would likely hold the two aces that have been dealt and draw
    three cards to replace the three, six, and nine in the hope of receiving additional aces or other cards
    leading to a winning combination with a higher award amount. After the draw and revealing of the
    final hand, the video poker game 1OC typically awards any credits won to the credit meter.
            The player selectable soft buttons 29C appearing on the screen respectively correspond to
  0 each card on the video display 20C. These soft buttons 29C allow players to select specific cards
    on the video display 20C such that the card corresponding to the selected soft button is "held"
    before the draw. Typically, video poker machines 1OC also include physical game buttons 32C
    that correspond to the cards in the hand and may be selected to hold a corresponding card. A
    deal/draw button 33C may also be included to initiate a gaming session after credits have been
  5 wagered (with a bet button 32C, for example) and to draw any cards not held after the first hand is
    displayed.
            Although examples of a spinning reel slot machine 10A, a video slot machine 1OB, and a
    video poker machine 1OC have been illustrated in FIGs. 2A-2C, gaming machines and various
    other types of gaming devices known in the art are contemplated and are within the scope of the
 !0 invention.
            FIG. 3 is a block diagram illustrating networked gaming devices according to embodiments
    of the invention. Referring to FIG. 3, multiple electronic gaming devices (EGMs) 70, 71, 72, 73,
    74, and 75 may be coupled to one another and coupled to a remote server 80 through a network 50.
    For ease of understanding, gaming devices or EGMs 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, and 75 are generically
25  referred to as EGMs 70-75. The term EGMs 70-75, however, may refer to any combination of one
    or more of EGMs 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, and 75. Additionally, the gaming server 80 may be coupled
    to one or more gaming databases 90. These gaming network 50 connections may allow multiple
    gaming devices 70-75 to remain in communication with one another during particular gaming
    modes such as tournament play or remote head-to-head play. Although some of the gaming
30  devices 70-75 coupled on the gaming network 50 may resemble the gaming devices 10, 1OA, 1OB,
    and 1OC shown in FIGs. lA-lB and 2A-2C, other coupled gaming devices 70-75 may include
                                                     11               A ++nrno-'e T~nAlrf No  1 '1 1 _10

    differently configured gaming devices. For example, the gaming devices 70-75 may include
    traditional slot machines 75 directly coupled to the network 50, banks of gaming devices 70
    coupled to the network 50, banks of gaming devices 70 coupled to the network through a bank
    controller 60, wireless handheld gaming machines 72 and cell phones 73 coupled to the gaming
  5 network 50 through one or more wireless routers or antennas 61, personal computers 74 coupled to
    the network 50 through the internet 62, and banks of gaming devices 71 coupled to the network
    through one or more optical connection lines 64. Additionally, some of the traditional gaming
    devices 70, 71, and 75 may include electronic gaming tables, multi-station gaming devices, or
    electronic components operating in conjunction with non-gaming components, such as automatic
  0 card readers, chip readers, and chip counters, for example.
             Gaming devices 71 coupled over an optical line 64 may be remote gaming devices in a
    different location or casino. The optical line 64 may be coupled to the gaming network 50 through
    an electronic to optical signal converter 63 and may be coupled to the gaming devices 71 through
    an optical to electronic signal converter 65. The banks of gaming devices 70 coupled to the
  5 network 50 may be coupled through a bank controller 60 for compatibility purposes, for local
    organization and control, or for signal buffering purposes. The network 50 may include serial or
    parallel signal transmission lines and carry data in accordance with data transfer protocols such as
    Ethernet transmission lines, Rs-232 lines, firewire lines, USB lines, or other communication
    protocols. Although not shown in FIG. 3, substantially the entire network 50 may be made of fiber
 !0 optic lines or may be a wireless network utilizing a wireless protocol such as IEEE 802.11 a, b, g,
    or n, Zigbee, RF protocols, optical transmission, near-field transmission, or the like.
             As mentioned above, each gaming device 70-75 may have an individual processor 40 (FIG.
    1A) and memory 41 to run and control game play on the gaming device 70-75, or some of the
    gaming devices 70-75 may be terminals that are run by a remote server 80 in a server based
25  gaming environment. Server based gaming environments may be advantageous to casinos by
    allowing fast downloading of particular game types or themes based on casino preference or player
    selection. Additionally, tournament based games, linked games, and certain game types, such as
    BINGO or keno may benefit from at least some server 80 based control.
             Thus, in some embodiments, the network 50, server 80, and database 90 may be dedicated
30  to communications regarding specific game or tournament play. In other embodiments, however,
    the network 50, server 80, and database 90 may be part of a player tracking network. For player
                                                    1)              A++fnrno-'e TnAlft No    1' 1'-1_0

    tracking capabilities, when a player inserts a player tracking card in the card reader 46 (FIG. 1A),
    the player tracking unit 45 sends player identification information obtained on the card reader 46
    through the MCI 42 over the network 50 to the player tracking server 80, where the player
    identification information is compared to player information records in the player database 90 to
  5 provide the player with information regarding their player account or other features at the gaming
    device 10 where the player is wagering. Additionally, multiple databases 90 and/or servers 80 may
    be present and coupled to one or more networks 50 to provide a variety of gaming services, such as
    both game/tournament data and player tracking data.
             The various systems described with reference to FIGs 1-3 can be used in a number of ways.
  0 For instance, the systems can be used to track data about various players. The tracked data can be
    used by the casino to provide additional benefits to players, such as extra bonuses or extra benefits
    such as bonus games and other benefits as described above. These added benefits further entice the
    players to play at the casino that provides the benefits.
            As noted above, it is desirable for players to be enrolled in the player-tracking system.
  5 This is typically done at the casino through a casino employee who is responsible for registering
    players in the system. This is typically done at a terminal where the player's identifying
    information is entered and a card is issued to the player. Of course there are other ways to
    identify the player to the system, but a card will be used in this embodiment.
             Cashless play is known in the prior art. One way of implementing cashless play is to
 !0 receive a deposit from a player and open an account reflecting the amount deposited. The
    account may be stored in or associated with the player's player-tracking account. When the
    player is identified at one of the gaming machines, like EGM 70, credits may be transferred via
    network 50 from the player account to the credit meter of the gaming machine. Also known are
    promotional credits, which are typically given to a player as an incentive. These credits can be
25  played but they cannot be cashed out. Using similar techniques, cashing out winnings reflected
    on another meter of the gaming device may be prevented or limited to achieve the objectives of
    this embodiment.
             Description will now be made of an incentive that a casino could offer consistent with the
    present development.
30           One way of inducing off-site enrollment is to offer discounted credits. For example, as
    shown in the first row of the table below, if the player signs up via a browser and commits $100
                                                         ill        Attcnrng'j   DcwnltNTcn  1.1-%1 _101

    via an online payment, e.g., credit card, bank transfer, etc., he or she will receive $110 in
    playable credits. Once the player is enrolled via a web browser, a card or other identifying device
    may be mailed to the player. Or the player may pick it up on arrival to the casino. In any event,
    once the player is identified to the player tracking system, the player is given access to the credits
  5 acquired, in this case, $110. This may be an automatic transfer from the account or in response to
    a command issued by the player at the gaming machine or via an associated player interface with
    network 50.
             Once the credits are so applied to the credit meter, the player can play them or cash them
    out along with whatever winnings might result from the play. This arrangement produces a
  0 newly enrolled player in the casino and at a game ready to play-without requiring casino
    personnel to enroll the player.
             Another embodiment is depicted on row 2 of the table. In this embodiment, the player
    may sign up at the casino or via the browser. The player would typically acquire more credits by
    doing so via a web browser. In any event, in this embodiment, the credits acquired cannot be
  5 cashed out; they can only be played. Any jackpot awards, however, that result from play with
    these credits may be cashed out.
             In the third row, another embodiment is illustrated in which the player receives $140. It is
    higher because in this version, the player cannot cashout any credits until after he or she has
    wagered a total of $300. There is some chance that the player will run out of money before
 !0 wagering the full $300, but most likely the reinvested winnings will see the player through to the
    $300 at which time any remaining funds on the credit meter may be cashed out.
             In the fourth row, the player acquires $300 because the cashout is restricted to the top
    award. In other words, the player will always play until all the money is gone, but if the top
    jackpot is hit before the money is gone, the top jackpot can be cashed out. Lower awards are paid
25  to the credit meter as credits that cannot be cashed out, only played. Alternatively, instead of
    restricting the ability to cash out only the top award, players may cash out the top X number of
    awards. These features are appealing to players who like to play for big jackpots and would be
    willing to receive a substantial discount on credits in exchange for being limited to cashing out
    the top jackpot or the top X number of jackpots.
30           In the fifth row, the player acquires $150 if the credits paid for by the player are played
    within a predefined time period. For example, the paid credits may need to be played within any
                                                     1A               A ++nrno-'e TnAlft No   1 '1 1 _01

    24-hour period, within X hours from purchase, on a specified weekday, between specified hours
    of the day, anytime but a weekend, so long as play does not start until after a predefined date or
    time, or any other defined time frame.
             Receiving the increased credits may further be conditioned on playing any of the paid-for
  5 credits within the predefined time period, playing all of the credits with the predefined time
    period, or playing a minimum amount within the predefined time period.
             In this feature, the player tracking system, which records the date and time of wagers,
    tracks play by the player to determine whether play has occurred within the predefined time
    period, which might be referenced to the time of purchase of credits or only to a calendar and
  0 clock, or to a combination of those. And the player-tracking system also tracks amounts played if
    that is also a criteria to receiving additional credits.
             If and when the player-tracking system determines that the predefined criterion or criteria
    is met, the player-tracking system credits the player account with additional credits that may be
    wagered. As with the other approaches, these credits may not be cashed out, and additional
  5 credits may be awarded if the player created the record and purchase of credits using a kiosk or
    his or her computing device.
             In one embodiment of this feature, the player is notified that credits are added if play is
    achieved within the predefined time period and/or in the amounts required to receive additional
    credits. This provides the gaming establishment where the games are played with incentives to
 !0 spur play during times when play is traditionally slow, and can also be used to provide incentive
    for the purchaser to compress the time in which he or she plays the credits. The player may be
    notified of the rules for increasing credits in the account when the credits are purchased-either
    just before or just after. Such notification can occur via a screen interface or in a poster or the
    like associated with a kiosk or player club desk where the purchase takes place.
25           Alternatively, the additional credits may be added at the time of purchase, but may not be
    cashed out unless play within the predefined time period is met. In a still further variation, the
    purchased credits may not be cashed out, but awards, either all or at specified levels, may be
    cashed out if play within the predefined time period is met.
             The foregoing discount features may also be transferrable from one person to another.
30  For example, one person could access the network, pay for discounted credits, and receive a
    card, bar code, or other indicia usable to access the account in a form that could be sent to
                                                          1  r% ~    Attcnrng'j Dcw1,nf NTc  1 '1r%1 -0)Or%

   someone as a gift electronically or otherwise. In short, given as a gift card for wagering credits
   that are discounted to the purchaser in any of the ways described above.
           Credits purchased according to this embodiment of the invention can be played on any
   game in the casino that is associated with a player-tracking interface and from which cashless
 5 play is implemented. The purchase may be scaled so that each category is provides a specified
   percentage enhancement of credits acquired for however much cash is used to purchase. In other
   words, if the enhancement is 20% and the player pays, e.g., $20, $40, or $45, the credits acquired
   are $24, $48, or $54, respectively.
           Different combinations of commitment levels may be offered to the player. In addition,
 0 some may be combined. For example, if players enroll via a browser for those on the 2 "dthrough
   4th rows, more credits may be acquired than if the player enrolled at the casino. In addition, the
   promotion may be limited to certain games or types of games. This limitation may be placed in
   the player's account. As a result, when the system identifies the player, only the specified games
   may be played. The available games may be in more than one casino.
