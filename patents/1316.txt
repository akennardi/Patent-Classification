                                    Government Support
              This invention was made with government support under NS-50210,
20   HD044093, DK-54759 and NS-592372 awarded by the National Institutes of
     Health. The government has certain rights in the invention.
                                Background of the Invention
              Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) can induce sequence-specific
25   posttranscriptional gene silencing in many organisms by a process known as
     RNA interference (RNAi). However, in mammalian cells, dsRNA that is 30
     base pairs or longer can induce sequence-nonspecific responses that trigger a
     shut-down of protein synthesis. Interference of gene expression by RNAi
     molecules is now recognized as a naturally occurring strategy for silencing genes
30   in the cells of many organisms.
              Cells can contain various small dsRNAs (-21-25 bp). Two types of
     small RNA molecules have a post-transcriptional effect: (1) siRNA molecules
     that induce mRNA degradation, and (2) miRNAs, also called microRNAs, that
                                               1

WO 2008/150897                                                         PCT/US2008/065130
     induce translational inhibition. Other small RNAs work at the transcriptional
     level by affecting DNA and histone methylation. RNAi molecules can be
     generated exogenously (e.g., siRNA molecules), and induce transient gene
     silencing. Alternatively, RNAi molecules can be introduced via a vector that
 5   expresses short-hairpin RNAs (shRNA) in order to exhibit persistent gene
     silencing.
                                     Summary of the Invention
             The present invention provides an isolated miRNA shuttle vector that
10   expresses a therapeutic siRNA with limited off target toxicity. In certain
     embodiments, embedding an siRNA that exhibits off target toxicity in the
     context of an shRNA shuttle vector within the miRNA shuttle vectors of the
     present invention limits the off target toxicity of the siRNA. In certain
     embodiments, the miRNA shuttle vector expresses a therapeutic siRNA in the
15   brain with limited off target toxicity. In certain embodiments, the miRNA shuttle
     vector expresses a therapeutic siRNA in the striatum with limited off target
     toxicity. In certain embodiments, the miRNA shuttle vector expresses a
     therapeutic siRNA in the cerebrum with limited off target toxicity.
             The present invention provides an isolated nucleic acid encoding a
20   primary transcript (pri-miRNA) including, in order of position, a 5'-flanking
     region, a first siRNA region, a loop region, a second siRNA region, and a 3'
     flanking region (Fig. 20A-20F). In certain embodiments, the 5'-flanking region
     is contiguously linked to the first siRNA region, the loop region is positioned
     between the first siRNA region and the second siRNA region, and the second
25   siRNA region is contiguously linked to the 3'-flanking region. In certain
     embodiments, the first siRNA region is a non-guide region and the second
     siRNA region is a guide region, and in other embodiments the first siRNA
     region is a guide region and the second siRNA region is a non-guide region. As
     used herein, the term "siRNA guide region" is a single-stranded sequence of
30   RNA that is complementary to a target sequence. As used herein, the term
     "siRNA non-guide region" is a single-stranded sequence of RNA that is
     complementary to the "siRNA guide region." Thus, under the proper conditions,
     the siRNA guide region and the siRNA non-guide region associate to form an
                                                2

 WO 2008/150897                                                         PCT/US2008/065130
     RNA duplex. As used herein, all nucleic acid sequences are listed, as is
     customary, in a 5' to 3' direction.
             In certain embodiments, the first siRNA region is about 20-30
     nucleotides in length, and is about 70-100% complementary to the second
 5   siRNA region, which is also about 20-30 nucleotides in length.
             In certain embodiments, the 5'-flanking region contains a 5'-joining
     sequence contiguously linked to the first siRNA region (Fig. 20B and 20C). As
     used herein, the term "joining site" or a "joining sequence" is a short nucleic
     acid sequence of less than 60 nucleotides that connects two other nucleic acid
10   sequences. In certain embodiments, the joining site is of a length of any integer
     between 4 and 50, inclusive. In certain embodiments, the 5'-joining sequence
     consists of 5-7 nucleotides (e.g., consists of 6 nucleotides). In certain
     embodiments, the 5'-joining sequence encodes GUGASSS, wherein S is either a
     G or C nucleotide (i.e., the 5'-joining sequence encodes UGACCC, UGACCG,
15   UGACGC, UGAGCC, UGACGG, UGAGGC, UGAGCG, or UGAGGG). In
     certain embodiments, the 5'-joining sequence encodes GUGAGCG.
             In certain embodiments, the 5'-flanking region further comprises a 5'
     bulge sequence positioned upstream from the 5'-joining sequence. As used
     herein, the term "bulge sequence" is a region of nucleic acid that is non
20   complementary to the nucleic acid opposite it in a duplex. For example, a
     duplex will contain a region of complementary nucleic acids, then a region of
     non-complementary nucleic acids, followed by a second region of
     complementary nucleic acids. The regions of complementary nucleic acids will
     bind to each other, whereas the central non-complementary region will not bind,
25   thereby forming a "bulge." In certain embodiments the two strands of nucleic
     acid positioned between the two complementary regions will be of different
     lengths, thereby forming a "bulge." In certain embodiments, the 5'-bulge
     sequence will contain from 2 to 15 nucleotides. In certain embodiments, the 5'
     bulge sequence consists of about 1-10 nucleotides. In certain embodiments, the
30   5'-bulge sequence encodes UAAACUCGA. In certain embodiments, the 5'
     bulge sequence has from 0-50% complementarity to the 3'-bulge sequence. The
     XhoI restriction site is CTCGAG (with "T" being "U" in RNA form in this and
     all other sequences listed herein).
                                                3

 WO 2008/150897                                                         PCT/US2008/065130
              In certain embodiments, the 5'-flanking region further contains a 5'
     spacer sequence positioned upstream from the 5'-bulge sequence. In certain
     embodiments, the 5'-spacer sequence consists of 9-12 nucleotides, such as 10-12
     nucleotides. In certain embodiments, the 5'-spacer sequence has from 60-100%
 5   complementarity to a 3'-spacer sequence. In certain embodiments, the 5'-bulge
     sequence comprises a cloning site, such as an XhoI site. In certain
     embodiments, the 5'-spacer sequence is UGGUACCGUU (SEQ ID NO:180).
              In certain embodiments, the 5'-flanking region further contains a 5'
     upstream sequence positioned upstream from the 5'-spacer sequence. In certain
10   embodiments, the 5'-upstream sequence is about 5-5000 nucleotides in length,
     such as 30-2000 nucleotides in length.
              In certain embodiments, the 3'-flanking region contains a 3'-joining
     sequence contiguously linked to the second siRNA region (Fig. 20D and 20E).
     In certain embodiments, the joining site is of a length of any integer between 4
15   and 50, inclusive. In certain embodiments, the 3'-joining sequence consists of 5
     7 nucleotides, (e.g., consists of 6 nucleotides). In certain embodiments, the 3'
     joining sequence is at least about 85% complementary to a 5'-joining sequence.
     In certain embodiments, the 3'-joining sequence encodes CGCYUAC, wherein Y
      is C or U. In certain embodiments, the 3'-joining sequence encodes CGCCUAC.
20            In certain embodiments, the 3'-flanking region further comprises a 3'
     bulge sequence positioned downstream from the 3'-joining sequence. In certain
      embodiments, the 3'-bulge sequence comprises a cloning site, such as a
      SpeI/XbaI site or a SpeI site. The SpeI/XbaI site is encoded by CTCAGA, and
     the SpeI site is encoded by CTCAGT. In certain embodiments, the 3'-bulge
25    sequence consists of about 1-15 nucleotides (such as 2-15 nucleotides or 1-10
      nucleotides). In certain embodiments, the 3'-bulge sequence encodes UAG. In
      certain embodiments, the 5'-bulge sequence is complementary to the 3'- bulge
      sequence at only one nucleotide at each end of the sequence.
              In certain embodiments, the 3'-flanking region further contains a 3'
30    spacer sequence positioned downstream from the 3'-bulge sequence. In certain
      embodiments, the 3'-spacer sequence consists of 9-12 nucleotides, such as 10-12
      nucleotides. In certain embodiments, the 3'-spacer sequence is
                                                4

     AGCGGCCGCCA (SEQ ID NO:18 1). In certain embodiments, the 3'-spacer
     sequence is at least about 70% complementary to a 5'-spacer sequence.
              In certain embodiments, the 3'-flanking region further contains a 3'
     downstream sequence positioned downstream from the 3'-spacer sequence. In
 5   certain embodiments, a 5'-upstream sequence does not significantly pair with the
     3'-downstream sequence. As used herein, the term "does not significantly pair
     with" means that the two strands are less than 20% homologous. In certain
     embodiments, the 3'-downstream sequence is about 5-5000 nucleotides in length,
     such as 30-2000 nucleotides in length.
10           In certain embodiments, the loop region is from 4-20 nucleotides in
     length, such as 15-19 nucleotides in length. From 0-50% of the loop region can
     be complementary to another portion of the loop region. As used herein, the
     term "loop region" is a sequence that joins two complementary strands of
     nucleic acid. In certain embodiments, 1-3 nucleotides of the loop region are
15   immediately contiguous to the complementary strands of nucleic acid may be
     complementary to the last 1-3 nucleotides of the loop region. For example, the
     first two nucleic acids in the loop region may be complementary to the last two
     nucleotides of the loop region. In certain embodiments, the loop region is 17
     nucleotides in length. In certain embodiments, the loop region encodes
20   CUNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNGG                  (SEQ ID NO:182) or
     CCNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNGG                  (SEQ ID NO:183). In certain embodiments,
     the loop region encodes CUGUGAAGCCACAGAUGGG (SEQ ID NO:184) or
     CCGUGAAGCCACAGAUGGG (SEQ ID NO: 185).
             The present invention further provides an RNA encoded by nucleic acid
25   described herein.
             The present invention further provides an expression cassette containing
     a promoter contiguously linked to the nucleic acid described herein. In certain
     embodiments, the promoter is a pollI or a polIlI promoter, such as a U6
     promoter (e.g., a mouse U6 promoter). In certain embodiments, the expression
30   cassette further contains a marker gene. In certain embodiments, the promoter is
     a pollI promoter. In certain embodiments, the promoter is a tissue-specific
     promoter. In certain embodiments, the promoter is an inducible promoter. In
     certain embodiments, the promoter is a polIll promoter.

             The present invention provides a vector containing a U6 promoter
     operably linked to a nucleic acid encoding an miRNA. The predicted
     transcription start sites of constructs of the present invention are different from
     those used by researchers in the past. In certain embodiments of the present
30   invention, the U6miRNA has an extended 5' end. If the 5' end is truncated to
     resemble the previous CMV-based strategy, silencing efficacy is severely
     reduced. The present invention also provides improved flanking sequences that
     show improved efficacy over natural miR-30 flanking sequences. The use of the

     present miRNA strategy appears to alleviate toxicity associated with traditional
     shRNA approaches. The miRNA strategy does not generally generate excessive
     amounts of RNAi as do U6shRNA approaches.
             As used herein the term "stem sequence" is a sequence that is
 5   complementary to another sequence in the same molecule, where the two
     complementary strands anneal to form a duplex (e.g., the first and second siRNA
     regions). The duplex that is formed maybe fully complementary, or may be less
     than fully complementary, such as 99%, 98%, 97%, 96%, 95,%, 94%, 93%,

10   or 70% complementary to each other. Further, in certain embodiments, one
     strand may contain more nucleotides than the other strand, allowing the
     formation of a side loop.

              This invention relates to compounds, compositions, and methods useful
     for modulating Huntington's Disease (also referred to as huntingtin, htt, or HD)
     gene expression using short interfering nucleic acid (siRNA) molecules. This
     invention also relates to compounds, compositions, and methods useful for
 5   modulating the expression and activity of other genes involved in pathways of
     HD gene expression and/or activity by RNA interference (RNAi) using small
     nucleic acid molecules. In particular, the instant invention features small nucleic
     acid molecules, such as short interfering nucleic acid (siNA), short interfering
     RNA (siRNA), double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), micro-RNA (miRNA), and
10   short hairpin RNA (shRNA) molecules and methods used to modulate the
     expression HD genes. A siRNA molecule of the instant invention can be, e.g.,
     chemically synthesized, expressed from a vector or enzymatically synthesized.
              As used herein when a claim indicates an RNA "corresponding to" it is
     meant the RNA that has the same sequence as the DNA, except that uracil is
15   substituted for thymine.
              In certain embodiments of the present invention, the alleles of the
     targeted gene may differ by seven or fewer nucleotides (e.g., 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 or 1
     nucleotides). For example the alleles may differ by only one nucleotide.
     Examples of targeted gene transcripts include transcripts encoding a beta
20   glucuronidase, TorsinA, Ataxin-3, Tau, or huntingtin. The targeted genes and
     gene products (i.e., a transcript or protein) may be from different species of
     organisms, such as a mouse allele or a human allele of a target gene.
              In one embodiment, the present invention further provides a method of
     performing gene silencing in a mammal or mammalian cell by administering to
25   the mammal an isolated miRNA or shRNA molecule, wherein the miRNA or
      shRNA silences only one, or both, alleles of the targeted gene (for example the
     wild type and mutant alleles of HD gene) in the mammal or mammalian cell. In
      one example, the gene is a beta-glucuronidase gene. The alleles may be murine
      specific and human-specific alleles of beta-glucuronidase. Examples of gene
30    transcripts include an RNA transcript complementary to TorsinA, Ataxin-3,
      huntingtin or Tau. The targeted gene may be a gene associated with a condition
      amenable to siRNA therapy. For example, the condition amenable to siRNA
      therapy could be a disabling neurological disorder.

             "Neurological disease" and "neurological disorder" refer to both
    hereditary and sporadic conditions that are characterized by nervous system
    dysfunction, and which may be associated with atrophy of the affected central or
    peripheral nervous system structures, or loss of function without atrophy. A
 5  neurological disease or disorder that results in atrophy is commonly called a
    "neurodegenerative disease" or "neurodegenerative disorder."
    Neurodegenerative diseases and disorders include, but are not limited to,
    amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), hereditary spastic hemiplegia, primary
    lateral sclerosis, spinal muscular atrophy, Kennedy's disease, Alzheimer's
10  disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and repeat expansion
    neurodegenerative diseases, e.g., diseases associated with expansions of
    trinucleotide repeats such as polyglutamine (polyQ) repeat diseases, e.g.,
    Huntington's disease (HD), spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6,
    SCA7, and SCA17), spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA),
15  dentatorubropallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA). An example of a disabling
    neurological disorder that does not appear to result in atrophy is DYTI dystonia.
    The gene of interest may encode a ligand for a chemokine involved in the
    migration of a cancer cell, or a chemokine receptor.
             The present invention further provides a method of substantially
20   silencing a target gene of interest or targeted allele for the gene of interest in
     order to provide a therapeutic effect. As used herein the term "substantially
     silencing" or "substantially silenced" refers to decreasing, reducing, or inhibiting
     the expression of the target gene or target allele by at least about 5%, 10%, 15%,
     20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%
25   to 100%. As used herein the term "therapeutic effect" refers to a change in the
     associated abnormalities of the disease state, including pathological and
     behavioral deficits; a change in the time to progression of the disease state; a
     reduction, lessening, or alteration of a symptom of the disease; or an
     improvement in the quality of life of the person afflicted with the disease.
30   Therapeutic effects can be measured quantitatively by a physician or
     qualitatively by a patient afflicted with the disease state targeted by the siRNA.
     In certain embodiments wherein both the mutant and wild type allele are
     substantially silenced, the term therapeutic effect defines a condition in which
                                                13

    silencing of the wild type allele's expression does not have a deleterious or
    harmful effect on normal functions such that the patient would not have a
    therapeutic effect.
             In one embodiment, the present invention further provides a method of
 5  substantially silencing both alleles (e.g., both mutant and wild type alleles) of a
    target gene. In certain embodiments, the targeting of both alleles of a gene target
    of interest can confer a therapeutic effect by allowing a certain level of continued
    expression of the wild-type allele while at the same time inhibiting expression of
    the mutant (e.g., disease associated) allele at a level that provides a therapeutic
10  effect. For example, a therapeutic effect can be achieved by conferring on the
    cell the ability to express siRNA as an expression cassette, wherein the
    expression cassette contains a nucleic acid encoding a small interfering RNA
    molecule (siRNA) targeted against both alleles, and wherein the expression of
    the targeted alleles are silenced at a level that inhibits, reduces, or prevents the
15  deleterious gain of function conferred by the mutant allele, but that still allows
    for adequate expression of the wild type allele at a level that maintains the
     function of the wild type allele. Examples of such wild type and mutant alleles
     include without limitation those associated with polyglutamine diseases such as
    Huntington's Disease.
20           In one embodiment, the present invention further provides a method of
     substantially silencing a target allele while allowing expression of a wild-type
     allele by conferring on the cell the ability to express siRNA as an expression
     cassette, wherein the expression cassette contains a nucleic acid encoding a
     small interfering RNA molecule (siRNA) targeted against a target allele, wherein
25   expression from the targeted allele is substantially silenced but wherein
     expression of the wild-type allele is not substantially silenced.
             In one embodiment, the present invention provides a method of treating a
     dominantly inherited disease in an allele-specific manner by administering to a
     patient in need thereof an expression cassette, wherein the expression cassette
30   contains a nucleic acid encoding a small interfering RNA molecule (siRNA)
     targeted against a target allele, wherein expression from the target allele is
     substantially silenced but wherein expression of the wild-type allele is not
     substantially silenced.

     encoding a small interfering RNA molecule (siRNA) targeted against both the
 5   mutant allele and the wild type allele of the target gene, wherein expression from
     the mutant allele is substantially silenced at a level that still allows for
     expression from the wild type allele to maintain its function in the patient.
              In one embodiment, the present invention provides a method of
     performing gene silencing in a mammal by administering to the mammal a
10   vector containing an expression cassette, wherein the expression cassette
     contains a nucleic acid encoding at least one strand of a small interfering RNA
     molecule (siRNA) targeted against a gene of interest, wherein the siRNA
     silences one or both alleles of the gene.
              In one embodiment, the present invention provides a method of screening
15   of allele-specific siRNA duplexes, involving contacting a cell containing a
     predetermined mutant allele with an siRNA with a known sequence, contacting a
     cell containing a wild-type allele with an siRNA with a known sequence, and
     determining if the mutant allele is substantially silenced while the wild-type
     allele retains substantially normal activity.

10   the subject or organism with a siRNA of the invention under conditions suitable
     to modulate the expression of the HD gene in the subject or organism whereby

     comprising a trinucleotide (CAG) repeat expansion). In one embodiment, the
15   HD gene target comprises both HD allele (e.g., an allele comprising a
     trinucleotide (CAG) repeat expansion and a wild type allele). The siRNA
     molecule of the invention can be expressed from vectors as described herein or
     otherwise known in the art to target appropriate tissues or cells in the subject or

20           In one embodiment, the invention features a method for treating or
     preventing Huntington's Disease in a subject or organism comprising, contacting
     the subject or organism with a siRNA molecule of the invention via local
     administration to relevant tissues or cells, such as brain cells and tissues (e.g.,

     methods and devices useful for stereotactic and convection enhanced delivery of
     reagents that can be readily adapted for delivery of siRNAs, vectors, or
     expression cassettes of the invention to a subject or organism, and are
 5   incorporated by reference herein in their entirety. Particular devices that may be
     useful in delivering siRNAs, vectors, or expression cassettes of the invention to a
     subject or organism are for example described in US Patent Application No.
     2004/0162255, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. The
     siRNA molecule of the invention can be expressed from vectors as described
10   herein or otherwise known in the art to target appropriate tissues or cells in the
     subject or organism.
              Methods of delivery of viral vectors include, but are not limited to, intra
     arterial, intra-muscular, intravenous, intranasal and oral routes. Generally, AAV
     virions may be introduced into cells of the CNS using either in vivo or in vitro
15   transduction techniques. If transduced in vitro, the desired recipient cell will be
     removed from the subject, transduced with AAV virions and reintroduced into
     the subject. Alternatively, syngeneic or xenogeneic cells can be used where those
     cells will not generate an inappropriate immune response in the subject.
              Suitable methods for the delivery and introduction of transduced cells
20   into a subject have been described. For example, cells can be transduced in vitro
     by combining recombinant AAV virions with CNS cells e.g., in appropriate
     media, and screening for those cells harboring the DNA of interest can be
     screened using conventional techniques such as Southern blots and/or PCR, or
     by using selectable markers. Transduced cells can then be formulated into
25   pharmaceutical compositions, described more fully below, and the composition
     introduced into the subject by various techniques, such as by grafting,
     intramuscular, intravenous, subcutaneous and intraperitoneal injection.
              In one embodiment, for in vivo delivery, AAV virions are formulated into
     pharmaceutical compositions and will generally be administered parenterally,
30   e.g., by intramuscular injection directly into skeletal or cardiac muscle or by
     injection into the CNS.
              In one embodiment, viral vectors of the invention are delivered to the

WO 2008/150897                                                           PCT/US2008/065130
      deliver viral vectors, e.g., AAV, over large regions of a subject's brain (e.g.,
      striatum and/or cortex). As described in detail and exemplified below, these
      methods are suitable for a variety of viral vectors, for instance AAV vectors
      carrying therapeutic genes (e.g., siRNAs).
  5           Any convection-enhanced delivery device may be appropriate for
      delivery of viral vectors. In one embodiment, the device is an osmotic pump or
      an infusion pump. Both osmotic and infusion pumps are commercially available
      from a variety of suppliers, for example Alzet Corporation, Hamilton
      Corporation, Aiza, Inc., Palo Alto, Calif.). Typically, a viral vector is delivered
 10  via CED devices as follows. A catheter, cannula or other injection device is
     inserted into CNS tissue in the chosen subject. In view of the teachings herein,
     one of skill in the art could readily determine which general area of the CNS is
     an appropriate target. For example, when delivering AAV vector encoding a
     therapeutic gene to treat HD, the striatum is a suitable area of the brain to target.
 15  Stereotactic maps and positioning devices are available, for example from ASI
     Instruments, Warren, Mich. Positioning may also be conducted by using
     anatomical maps obtained by CT and/or MRI imaging of the subject's brain to
     help guide the injection device to the chosen target. Moreover, because the
     methods described herein can be practiced such that relatively large areas of the
20   brain take up the viral vectors, fewer infusion cannula are needed. Since surgical
     complications are related to the number of penetrations, the methods described
     herein also serve to reduce the side effects seen with conventional delivery
     techniques.
             In one embodiment, pharmaceutical compositions will comprise
25   sufficient genetic material to produce a therapeutically effective amount of the
     siRNA of interest, i.e., an amount sufficient to reduce or ameliorate symptoms of
    the disease state in question or an amount sufficient to confer the desired benefit.
    The pharmaceutical compositions may also contain a pharmaceutically
    acceptable excipient. Such excipients include any pharmaceutical agent that
30  does not itself induce the production of antibodies harmful to the individual
    receiving the composition, and which may be administered without undue
    toxicity. Pharmaceutically acceptable excipients include, but are not limited to,
    sorbitol, Tween80, and liquids such as water, saline, glycerol and ethanol.
                                               18

     Pharmaceutically acceptable salts can be included therein, for example, mineral
     acid salts such as hydrochlorides, hydrobromides, phosphates, sulfates, and the
     like; and the salts of organic acids such as acetates, propionates, malonates,
     benzoates, and the like. Additionally, auxiliary substances, such as wetting or
 5   emulsifying agents, pH buffering substances, and the like, may be present in
     such vehicles. A thorough discussion of pharmaceutically acceptable excipients
     is available in REMINGTON'S PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES (Mack Pub.
     Co., N.J. 1991).
             As is apparent to those skilled in the art in view of the teachings of this
10   specification, an effective amount of viral vector which must be added can be
     empirically determined. Administration can be effected in one dose,
     continuously or intermittently throughout the course of treatment. Methods of
     determining the most effective means and dosages of administration are well
     known to those of skill in the art and will vary with the viral vector, the
15   composition of the therapy, the target cells, and the subject being treated. Single
     and multiple administrations can be carried out with the dose level and pattern
     being selected by the treating physician.
              It should be understood that more than one transgene could be expressed
     by the delivered viral vector. Alternatively, separate vectors, each expressing
20   one or more different transgenes, can also be delivered to the CNS as described
     herein. Furthermore, it is also intended that the viral vectors delivered by the
     methods of the present invention be combined with other suitable compositions
     and therapies.
              The present invention further provides an miRNA or shRNA, an
25   expression cassette and/or a vector as described herein for use in medical
     treatment or diagnosis.
              The present invention provides the use of an miRNA or shRNA, an
     expression cassette and/or a vector as described herein to prepare a medicament
     useful for treating a condition amenable to RNAi in an animal, e.g., useful for
30   treating Huntington's Disease.
              The present invention also provides a nucleic acid, expression cassette,
     vector, or composition of the invention for use in therapy.

     samples (n = 3, * = P < 0.05). (Fig. 4C) Strand-biasing of U6-driven HD2.1

     18C). RNAi reporter and RNAi expression plasmids were co-transfected into
     HEK293 cells, and Dual-Glo@ Luciferase assays were performed at 24 h.
     Results are shown as mean ± S.E.M (n = 4) relative to mock-treated controls and
     demonstrate that shHD2.1 preferentially loads the unintended siRNA strand

     cassette for normalization. (Fig. 18D) Silencing activity of miR-30 variants.
     Artificial miSCA1 variants and RNAi reporter expression plasmids were co
     transfected into HEK293 cells, and Dual-Glo@ Luciferase assays were
 5   performed after 24 h. Results of two independent experiments (each n = 3) are
     shown relative to mock-treated (i.e., promoter only) controls and demonstrate
     that variant 2 (miV2) is the most effective artificial miRNA (even more effective
     than human miR-30, ** = P < 0.01).       (Fig. 18E) Small transcript northern blot
     was performed at 48 h post-transfection of miRNA variant expression plasmids
10   into HEK293 cells. Results show that miV2 yields more mature antisense RNA
     (SCAl AS) compared to the other artificial miRNA variants including the
     natural miR-30 shuttle.
             Figure 19 provides additional miRNA sequences that were used to target
     either HD or SCAl. These are the predicted RNA stem loop structures that

     Glo@ Luciferase assays were performed at 24 h. Results are shown as mean
     S.D. (n = 3) relative to mock-treated controls and confirm that sub-optimal
     overhangs decrease silencing efficiency. Notably, each shRNA preferentially
10   silenced the intended target (transfected at 1:20 RNAi:Target) relative to the
     unintended target (transfected at 3:1 RNAi:Target).

                            Detailed Description of the Invention
             RNA interference (RNAi) provides a promising approach for the
    treatment of several human diseases. However, the safety of expressed vector
     based RNAi-based therapies remains a concern. Safety concerns for vector
 5   expressed RNAi therapies arise as a result of off target toxicity.
             The use of RNAi as a therapeutic is dependant upon the elucidation of
     several factors including i) the delivery and persistence of the RNAi construct
     for effective silencing of the target gene sequence; ii) the design of the siRNA in
     order to achieve effective knock down or gene suppression of the target
10   sequence, and iii) the optimal siRNA expression system (shRNA or miRNA) for
     delivery of the therapeutic siRNA. While many studies have evaluated the use
     of RNAi delivered as chemically synthesized oligonucleotide structures, for
     many clinical conditions and disease states such as Huntington's Disease, it is
     believed that to achieve therapeutic benefit there is a need for long term and or
15   persistent high level expression of the therapeutic siRNA as achieved by
     endogenous production of expressed siRNA. To date, shRNA- and artificial
     miRNA-based strategies have been compared with conflicting results (Boden et
     al., 2004, Nucleic Acids Res 32: 1154-1158; Silva et al., 2005, Nat Genet 37:
     1281-1288; Li et al., 2007, RNA 13: 1765-1774). The therapeutic utility of
20   expressed RNAi is unresolved due to safety concerns as a result of off target
     toxicity arising from cellular responses to dsRNA (IFN-b, PKR, OAS 1),
     saturation of RNAi machinery or silencing of off targets via partial
     complementarity with unintended mRNAs. Thus, there is an on-going need for
     optimizing expressed RNAi vectors that are safe and effective.
25           shRNAs are comprised of stem-loop structures which are designed to
     contain a 5' flanking region, siRNA region segments, a loop region, a 3' siRNA
     region and a 3' flanking region. Most RNAi expression strategies have utilized
     short-hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) driven by strong polIl-based promoters. Many
     shRNAs have demonstrated effective knock down of the target sequences in
30   vitro as well as in vivo, however, some shRNAs which demonstrated effective
     knock down of the target gene were also found to have toxicity in vivo. A
     recently discovered alternative approach is the use of artificial miRNAs (pri
     miRNA scaffolds shuttling siRNA sequences) as RNAi vectors. Artificial
                                               31

 WO 2008/150897                                                         PCT/US2008/065130
     miRNAs more naturally resemble endogenous RNAi substrates and are more
     amenable to Pol-II transcription (e.g., allowing tissue-specific expression of
     RNAi) and polycistronic strategies (e.g., allowing delivery of multiple siRNA
     sequences). To date the efficacy of miRNA based vector systems compared to
 5   shRNA has been confounded by conflicting results. Importantly, the question of
     off-target toxicity produced by the two systems has not been evaluated.
             An important consideration for development of expressed siRNA is the
     concept of "dosing" the host cell with the expressed siRNA construct. "Dosing"
     for an expressed siRNA in the context of the present invention refers to and can
10   be dependant on the delivery vehicle (e.g., viral or nonviral), the relative
     amounts or concentration of the delivery vehicle, and the strength and specificity
     of the promoter utilized to drive the expression of the siRNA sequence. In the
     present application the inventors have directly compared the efficacy and off
     target toxicity of the expressed RNAi vectors under conditions where the
15   shRNAs and miRNAs were delivered at equivalent dose by an AAV vector.
             The inventors have developed artificial miRNA shuttle vectors that
     incorporate the stem loop sequences contained in shRNAs within modifications
     of a naturally occurring human microRNA 30 sequence or mi30 sequence that
     serve to shuttle these small interfering RNA (siRNA) sequences. Unlike
20   previously published reports, these miRNA shuttles were subsequently
     compared to optimized shRNA constructs. The shRNA constructs were
     optimized to contain sequences with the weakest base pairing near the 5'end of
     the antisense or guide when compared to the sense or non-guide strand in order
     to allow for efficient processing and loading of the antisense into the RNAi
25   induced silencing complex (RISC). These optimized siRNAs were then
     compared to the artificial miRNA shuttle vectors containing the identical target
     sequences. The inventors found that optimized shRNAs, independent of siRNA
     sequence and target sequence, generate more processed siRNAs and are more
     efficient at mediating gene silencing. However, northern blot analysis showed
30   an overabundance of unprocessed shRNAs as well as mature antisense RNA
     molecules, whereas processing of the miRNA shuttles was highly efficient. The
     inventors hypothesized that the unprocessed shRNAs may arise due to saturation
     of the RNAi machinery and may result in additional safety concerns due to off
                                               32

WO 2008/150897                                                         PCT/US2008/065130
    target toxicity. In addition, while certain shRNAs were demonstrated to be
    potent gene silencers as a result of overabundant or overexpression of shRNAs,
    they were also overly toxic when delivered in vivo to brains. An approach to
    reduce toxicity evaluated by the inventors was to lower the dose of the shRNA
 5  delivered by lowering the viral titer injected, thereby decreasing the copy
    number of the siRNA in the transduced cell, resulting in lower expression of the
     siRNA. However, lowering the dose in terms of viral titer did not reduce off
    target toxicity in the brain until the dose was lowered to levels that were not
    effective in target gene silencing.
10          The inventors evaluated whether generation of artificial miRNAs would
    reduce off target toxicity, thereby improving the relative safety of siRNA as a
    potential therapeutic. The inventors evaluated off target toxicity of shRNA and
    miRNA vectors on the processing and function of artificial miRNAs designed to
    mimic endogenous stem loops. Northern blot analysis showed that shRNAs
15  markedly inhibited processing of artificial miRNAs, while miRNA shuttles had
    relatively no effect even at much higher doses. Similarly, shRNAs at low doses
    drastically reduced silencing mediated by artificial miRNAs, whereas miRNA
    shuttles at high doses only caused slight inhibition. Notably, silencing efficacies
    of miRNA shuttles (high dose) and shRNAs (low dose) were indistinguishable.
20  These results suggest that shRNA-based vectors saturate cellular RNAi
    machinery substantially more than miRNA shuttles. Surprisingly, sequences
    that were found to have off-target toxicity in vivo in the context of a shRNA
    vector, when placed into the artificial miRNA vector of the present invention,
    demonstrated attenuated off-target toxicity yet retained effective target gene
25  silencing. Hence, the miRNA shuttle vector of the present invention provides a
    safer approach to deliver therapeutic RNAi in vivo.
            MicroRNA Shuttles for RNAi
            miRNAs are small cellular RNAs (-22nt) that are processed from
30  precursor stem loop transcripts. Known miRNA stem loops can be modified to
    contain RNAi sequences specific for genes of interest. miRNA molecules can be
    preferable over shRNA molecules because miRNAs are endogenously
    expressed. Therefore, miRNA molecules are unlikely to induce dsRNA
                                              33

     responsive interferon pathways, they are processed more efficiently than
     shRNAs, and they have been shown to silence 80% more effectively.
              Also, the promoter roles are different for miRNA molecules as compared
     to shRNA molecules. Tissue-specific, inducible expression of shRNAs involves
  5  truncation of pollI promoters to the transcription start site. In contrast, miRNAs
     can be expressed from any pollI promoter because the transcription start and
     stop sites can be relatively arbitrary.
              Treatment of Diseases
 10           The dominant polyglutamine expansion diseases, which include
     Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) and Huntington's disease (HD), are
     progressive, untreatable neurodegenerative disorders. In inducible mouse
     models of SCAl and HD, repression of mutant allele expression improves
     disease phenotypes. Thus, therapies designed to inhibit disease gene expression
15   would be beneficial. In studies presented herein, the ability of RNA interference
     (RNAi) to inhibit polyglutamine-induced neurodegeneration caused by mutant
     ataxin-1 was evaluated in a mouse model of SCAL. Upon intracerebellar
     injection, recombinant AAV vectors expressing shRNAs profoundly improved
     motor coordination, restored cerebellar morphology, and resolved characteristic
20   ataxin-1 inclusions in Purkinje cells of SCAl mice. The present invention thus
    provides methods of using RNAi in vivo to treat dominant neurodegenerative
    diseases. "Treating" as used herein refers to ameliorating at least one symptom
    of, curing and/or preventing the development of a disease or a condition.
             In certain embodiment of the invention, siRNAs are employed to inhibit
25  expression of a target gene. By "inhibit expression" is meant to reduce, diminish
    or suppress expression of a target gene. Expression of a target gene may be
    inhibited via "gene silencing." Gene silencing refers to the suppression of gene
    expression, e.g., transgene, heterologous gene and/or endogenous gene
    expression, which may be mediated through processes that affect transcription
30  and/or through processes that affect post-transcriptional mechanisms. In some
    embodiments, gene silencing occurs when siRNA initiates the degradation of the
    mRNA transcribed from a gene of interest in a sequence-specific manner via
    RNA interference, thereby preventing translation of the gene's product.

     targeted alleles via siRNA. Use of this strategy results in markedly diminished
     in vitro and in vivo expression of targeted alleles. This strategy is useful in
     reducing expression of targeted alleles in order to model biological processes or
     to provide therapy for human diseases. For example, this strategy can be applied
10   to a major class of neurodegenerative disorders, the polyglutamine diseases, as is
     demonstrated by the reduction of polyglutamine aggregation in cells following
     application of the strategy. As used herein the term "substantial silencing"
     means that the mRNA of the targeted allele is inhibited and/or degraded by the
     presence of the introduced siRNA, such that expression of the targeted allele is
15   reduced by about 10% to 100% as compared to the level of expression seen
     when the siRNA is not present. Generally, when an allele is substantially
     silenced, it will have at least 40%, 50%, 60%, to 70%, e.g., 71%, 72%, 73%,
     74%, 75%, 76%, 77%, 78%, to 79%, generally at least 80%, e.g., 81%-84%, at
     least 85%, e.g., 86%, 87%, 88%, 89%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%,
20   97%, 98%, 99% or even 100% reduction expression as compared to when the
     siRNA is not present. As used herein the term "substantially normal activity"
     means the level of expression of an allele when an siRNA has not been
     introduced to a cell.
             Dominantly inherited diseases, including polyQ neurodegenerative
25   disorders, are ideal candidates for siRNA-based therapy. The polyQ
     neurodegenerative disorders include at least nine inherited disorders caused by
     CAG repeat expansions that encode polyQ in the disease protein. PolyQ
     expansion confers a dominant toxic property on the mutant protein that is
     associated with aberrant accumulation of the disease protein in neurons. PolyQ
30   diseases are progressive, ultimately fatal disorders that typically begin in
     adulthood. Huntington disease (HD) is the best known polyQ disease, but at
     least seven hereditary ataxias and one motor neuron disease are also due to CAG
     repeat/polyQ expansion. Although the clinical features and patterns of neuronal
                                              35

WO 2008/150897                                                          PCT/US2008/065130
     degeneration differ among the diseases, increasing evidence suggests that polyQ
     diseases share important pathogenic features. In particular, expansion of the
     CAG repeat/polyQ domain confers upon the encoded protein a dominant toxic
     property. Thus, as a therapeutic strategy, efforts to lower expression of the
 5   mutant gene product prior to cell death could be highly beneficial to patients.
              The polyQ neurodegenerative disorders include at least nine diseases
     caused by CAG repeat expansions that encode polyQ in the disease protein.
     PolyQ expansion confers a dominant toxic property on the mutant protein that is
     associated with aberrant accumulation of the disease protein in neurons. In
10   FTDP-17, Tau mutations lead to the formation of neurofibrillary tangles
     accompanied by neuronal dysfunction and degeneration. The precise
     mechanisms by which these mutant proteins cause neuronal injury are unknown,
     but considerable evidence suggests that the abnormal proteins themselves initiate
     the pathogenic process. Accordingly, eliminating expression of the mutant
15   protein by siRNA or other means slows or prevents disease. However, because
     many dominant disease genes also encode essential proteins siRNA-mediated
     approaches were developed that selectively inactivate mutant alleles, while
     allowing continued expression of the wild type proteins ataxin-3 and huntingtin.
20             .     RNA Interference (RNAi) Molecules
              An "RNA interference," "RNAi," "small interfering RNA" or "short
     interfering RNA" or "siRNA" or "short hairpin RNA" or "shRNA" molecule, or
     "miRNA" is a RNA duplex of nucleotides that is targeted to a nucleic acid
     sequence of interest, for example, ataxin-1 or huntingtin (htt). As used herein,
25   the term "siRNA" is a generic term that encompasses the subset of shRNAs and
     miRNAs. An "RNA duplex" refers to the structure formed by the
     complementary pairing between two regions of a RNA molecule. siRNA is
     "targeted" to a gene in that the nucleotide sequence of the duplex portion of the
     siRNA is complementary to a nucleotide sequence of the targeted gene. In
30   certain embodiments, the siRNAs are targeted to the sequence encoding ataxin-1
     or huntingtin. In some embodiments, the length of the duplex of siRNAs is less
     than 30 base pairs. In some embodiments, the duplex can be 29, 28, 27, 26, 25,
     24, 23, 22, 21, 20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11 or 10 base pairs in length. In
                                               36

WO 2008/150897                                                          PCT/US2008/065130
     some embodiments, the length of the duplex is 19 to 25 base pairs in length. In
     certain embodiment, the length of the duplex is 19 or 21 base pairs in length.
     The RNA duplex portion of the siRNA can be part of a hairpin structure. In
     addition to the duplex portion, the hairpin structure may contain a loop portion
 5   positioned between the two sequences that form the duplex. The loop can vary
     in length. In some embodiments the loop is 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15,
      16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24 or 25 nucleotides in length. In certain
     embodiments, the loop is 18 nucleotides in length. The hairpin structure can also
     contain 3' and/or 5' overhang portions. In some embodiments, the overhang is a
10   3' and/or a 5' overhang 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 nucleotides in length.
              The transcriptional unit of a "shRNA" is comprised of sense and
     antisense sequences connected by a loop of unpaired nucleotides. shRNAs are
     exported from the nucleus by Exportin-5, and once in the cytoplasm, are
     processed by Dicer to generate functional siRNAs. "miRNAs" stem-loops are
15   comprised of sense and antisense sequences connected by a loop of unpaired
     nucleotides typically expressed as part of larger primary transcripts (pri
     miRNAs), which are excised by the Drosha-DGCR8 complex generating
     intermediates known as pre-miRNAs, which are subsequently exported from the
     nucleus by Exportin-5, and once in the cytoplasm, are processed by Dicer to
20   generate functional siRNAs. "Artificial miRNA" or an "artificial miRNA shuttle
     vector", as used herein interchangably, refers to a primary miRNA transcript that
     has had a region of the duplex stem loop (at least about 9-20 nucleotides) which
     is excised via Drosha and Dicer processing replaced with the siRNA sequences
     for the target gene while retaining the structural elements within the stem loop
25   necessary for effective Drosha processing. The term "artificial" arises from the
     fact the flanking sequences (~35 nucleotides upstream and -40 nucleotides
     downstream) arise from restriction enzyme sites within the multiple cloning site
     of the siRNA. As used herein the term "miRNA" encompasses both the
     naturally occurring miRNA sequences as well as artificially generated miRNA
30   shuttle vectors.
              The siRNA can be encoded by a nucleic acid sequence, and the nucleic
     acid sequence can also include a promoter. The nucleic acid sequence can also
                                               37

WO 2008/150897                                                           PCT/US2008/065130
     include a polyadenylation signal. In some embodiments, the polyadenylation
     signal is a synthetic minimal polyadenylation signal or a sequence of six Ts.
             "Off-target toxicity" refers to deleterious, undesirable, or unintended
     phenotypic changes of a host cell that expresses or contains an siRNA. Off
 5   target toxicity may result in loss of desirable function, gain of non-desirable
     function, or even death at the cellular or organismal level. Off-target toxicity
     may occur immediately upon expression of the siRNA or may occur gradually
     over time. Off-target toxicity may occur as a direct result of the expression
     siRNA or may occur as a result of induction of host immune response to the cell
10   expressing the siRNA. Without wishing to be bound by theory, off-target
     toxicity is postulated to arise from high levels or overabundance of RNAi
     substrates within the cell. These overabundant or overexpressed RNAi
     substrates, including without limitation pre-or pri RNAi substrates as well as
     overabundant mature antisense-RNAs, may compete for endogenous RNAi
15   machinery, thus disrupting natural miRNA biogenesis and function. Off-target
     toxicity may also arise from an increased likelihood of silencing of unintended
     mRNAs (i.e., off-target) due to partial complementarity of the sequence. Off
     target toxicity may also occur from improper strand biasing of a non-guide
     region such that there is preferential loading of the non-guide region over the
20   targeted or guide region of the RNAi. Off-target toxicity may also arise from
     stimulation of cellular responses to dsRNAs which include dsRNA (IFN-b, PKR,
     OAS 1). "Decreased off target toxicity" refers to a decrease, reduction,
     abrogation or attenuation in off target toxicity such that the therapeutic effect is
     more beneficial to the host than the toxicity is limiting or detrimental as
25   measured by an improved duration or quality of life or an improved sign or
     symptom of a disease or condition being targeted by the siRNA. "Limited off
     target toxicity" or "low off target toxicity" is used to refer to an unintended
     undesirable phenotypic changes to a cell or organism, whether detectable or not,
     that does not preclude or outweigh or limit the therapeutic benefit to the host
30   treated with the siRNA and may be considered a "side effect" of the therapy.
     Decreased or limited off target toxicity may be determined or inferred by
     comparing the in vitro analysis such as Northern blot or QPCR for the levels of
                                               38

WO 2008/150897                                                        PCT/US2008/065130
     siRNA substrates or the in vivo effects comparing an equivalent shRNA vector
    to the miRNA shuttle vector of the present invention.
             "Knock-down," "knock-down technology" refers to a technique of gene
     silencing in which the expression of a target gene is reduced as compared to the
 5   gene expression prior to the introduction of the siRNA, which can lead to the
     inhibition of production of the target gene product. The term "reduced" is used
     herein to indicate that the target gene expression is lowered by 1-100%. In other
     words, the amount of RNA available for translation into a polypeptide or protein
     is minimized. For example, the amount of protein may be reduced by 10, 20, 30,
10   40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 95, or 99%. In some embodiments, the expression is
     reduced by about 90% (i.e., only about 10% of the amount of protein is observed
     a cell as compared to a cell where siRNA molecules have not been
     administered). Knock-down of gene expression can be directed by the use of
     dsRNAs or siRNAs.
15           "RNA interference (RNAi)" is the process of sequence-specific, post
     transcriptional gene silencing initiated by siRNA. During RNAi, siRNA induces
     degradation of target mRNA with consequent sequence-specific inhibition of
     gene expression.
             According to a method of the present invention, the expression of
20   huntingtin or atxain-1 can be modified via RNAi. For example, the
     accumulation of huntingtin or atxain-1 can be suppressed in a cell. The term
     "suppressing" refers to the diminution, reduction or elimination in the number or
     amount of transcripts present in a particular cell. For example, the accumulation
     of mRNA encoding huntingtin or atxain- 1 can be suppressed in a cell by RNA
25   interference (RNAi), e.g., the gene is silenced by sequence-specific double
     stranded RNA (dsRNA), which is also called short interfering RNA (siRNA).
     These siRNAs can be two separate RNA molecules that have hybridized
     together, or they may be a single hairpin wherein two portions of a RNA
     molecule have hybridized together to form a duplex.
30           A mutant protein refers to the protein encoded by a gene having a
     mutation, e.g., a missense or nonsense mutation in one or both alleles of
     huntingtin or atxain- 1. A mutant huntingtin or atxain- 1 may be disease-causing,
                                               39

WO 2008/150897                                                         PCT/US2008/065130
     i.e., may lead to a disease associated with the presence of huntingtin or atxain-1
     in an animal having either one or two mutant allele(s).
              The term "gene" is used broadly to refer to any segment of nucleic acid
     associated with a biological function. Thus, genes include coding sequences
 5   and/or the regulatory sequences required for their expression. For example,
     "gene" refers to a nucleic acid fragment that expresses mRNA, functional RNA,
     or specific protein, including regulatory sequences. "Genes" also include
     nonexpressed DNA segments that, for example, form recognition sequences for
     other proteins. "Genes" can be obtained from a variety of sources, including
10   cloning from a source of interest or synthesizing from known or predicted
     sequence information, and may include sequences designed to have desired
     parameters. An "allele" is one of several alternative forms of a gene occupying a
     given locus on a chromosome.
              The term "nucleic acid" refers to deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) or
15   ribonucleic acid (RNA) and polymers thereof in either single- or double-stranded
     form, composed of monomers (nucleotides) containing a sugar, phosphate and a
     base that is either a purine or pyrimidine. Unless specifically limited, the term
     encompasses nucleic acids containing known analogs of natural nucleotides that
     have similar binding properties as the reference nucleic acid and are metabolized
20   in a manner similar to naturally occurring nucleotides. Unless otherwise
     indicated, a particular nucleic acid sequence also encompasses conservatively
     modified variants thereof (e.g., degenerate codon substitutions) and
     complementary sequences, as well as the sequence explicitly indicated.
     Specifically, degenerate codon substitutions may be achieved by generating
25   sequences in which the third position of one or more selected (or all) codons is
     substituted with mixed-base and/or deoxyinosine residues. A "nucleic acid
     fragment" is a portion of a given nucleic acid molecule.
             A "nucleotide sequence" is a polymer of DNA or RNA that can be
     single- stranded or double-stranded, optionally containing synthetic, non-natural
30   or altered nucleotide bases capable of incorporation into DNA or RNA
    polymers.
              The terms "nucleic acid," "nucleic acid molecule," "nucleic acid
     fragment," "nucleic acid sequence or segment," or "polynucleotide" are used
                                              40

WO 2008/150897                                                            PCT/US2008/065130
     interchangeably and may also be used interchangeably with gene, cDNA, DNA
     and RNA encoded by a gene.
             The invention encompasses isolated or substantially purified nucleic acid
     nucleic acid molecules and compositions containing those molecules. In the
 5   context of the present invention, an "isolated" or "purified" DNA molecule or
     RNA molecule is a DNA molecule or RNA molecule that exists apart from its
     native environment and is therefore not a product of nature. An isolated DNA
     molecule or RNA molecule may exist in a purified form or may exist in a non
     native environment such as, for example, a transgenic host cell. For example, an
10   "isolated" or "purified" nucleic acid molecule or biologically active portion
     thereof, is substantially free of other cellular material, or culture medium when
     produced by recombinant techniques, or substantially free of chemical
     precursors or other chemicals when chemically synthesized. In one
     embodiment, an "isolated" nucleic acid is free of sequences that naturally flank
15   the nucleic acid (i.e., sequences located at the 5' and 3' ends of the nucleic acid)
     in the genomic DNA of the organism from which the nucleic acid is derived.
     For example, in various embodiments, the isolated nucleic acid molecule can
     contain less than about 5 kb, 4 kb, 3 kb, 2 kb, 1 kb, 0.5 kb, or 0.1 kb of
     nucleotide sequences that naturally flank the nucleic acid molecule in genomic
20   DNA of the cell from which the nucleic acid is derived. Fragments and variants
     of the disclosed nucleotide sequences are also encompassed by the present
     invention. By "fragment" or "portion" is meant a full length or less than full
     length of the nucleotide sequence.
             "Naturally occurring," "native," or "wild-type" is used to describe an
25   object that can be found in nature as distinct from being artificially produced.
     For example, a protein or nucleotide sequence present in an organism (including
     a virus), which can be isolated from a source in nature and that has not been
     intentionally modified by a person in the laboratory, is naturally occurring.
             A "variant" of a molecule is a sequence that is substantially similar to the
30   sequence of the native molecule. For nucleotide sequences, variants include
     those sequences that, because of the degeneracy of the genetic code, encode the
     identical amino acid sequence of the native protein. Naturally occurring allelic
     variants such as these can be identified with the use of molecular biology
                                                41

WO 2008/150897                                                        PCT/US2008/065130
    techniques, as, for example, with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and
     hybridization techniques. Variant nucleotide sequences also include
     synthetically derived nucleotide sequences, such as those generated, for
     example, by using site-directed mutagenesis, which encode the native protein, as
 5   well as those that encode a polypeptide having amino acid substitutions.
     Generally, nucleotide sequence variants of the invention will have at least 40%,
     50%, 60%, to 70%, e.g., 71%, 72%, 73%, 74%, 75%, 76%, 77%, 78%, to 79%,
     generally at least 80%, e.g., 81%-84%, at least 85%, e.g., 86%, 87%, 88%, 89%,
     90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, to 98%, sequence identity to the
10   native (endogenous) nucleotide sequence.
             The term "chimeric" refers to a gene or DNA that contains 1) DNA
     sequences, including regulatory and coding sequences that are not found together
     in nature or 2) sequences encoding parts of proteins not naturally adjoined, or 3)
     parts of promoters that are not naturally adjoined. Accordingly, a chimeric gene
15   may include regulatory sequences and coding sequences that are derived from
     different sources, or include regulatory sequences and coding sequences derived
     from the same source, but arranged in a manner different from that found in
     nature.
             A "transgene" refers to a gene that has been introduced into the genome
20   by transformation. Transgenes include, for example, DNA that is either
     heterologous or homologous to the DNA of a particular cell to be transformed.
     Additionally, transgenes may include native genes inserted into a non-native
     organism, or chimeric genes.
             The term "endogenous gene" refers to a native gene in its natural location
25   in the genome of an organism.
             A "foreign" gene refers to a gene not normally found in the host
     organism that has been introduced by gene transfer.
             The terms "protein," "peptide" and "polypeptide" are used
     interchangeably herein.
30           "Conservatively modified variations" of a particular nucleic acid
     sequence refer to those nucleic acid sequences that encode identical or
     essentially identical amino acid sequences. Because of the degeneracy of the
     genetic code, a large number of functionally identical nucleic acids encode any
                                              42

WO 2008/150897                                                           PCT/US2008/065130
    given polypeptide. For instance, the codons CGT, CGC, CGA, CGG, AGA and
    AGG all encode the amino acid arginine. Thus, at every position where an
    arginine is specified by a codon, the codon can be altered to any of the
    corresponding codons described without altering the encoded protein. Such
 5  nucleic acid variations are "silent variations," which are one species of
     "conservatively modified variations." Every nucleic acid sequence described
    herein that encodes a polypeptide also describes every possible silent variation,
     except where otherwise noted. One of skill in the art will recognize that each
     codon in a nucleic acid (except ATG, which is ordinarily the only codon for
10  methionine) can be modified to yield a functionally identical molecule by
     standard techniques. Accordingly, each "silent variation" of a nucleic acid that
     encodes a polypeptide is implicit in each described sequence.
             "Recombinant DNA molecule" is a combination of DNA sequences that
     are joined together using recombinant DNA technology and procedures used to
15  join together DNA sequences as described, for example, in Sambrook and
     Russell (2001).
             The terms "heterologous gene", "heterologous DNA sequence",
     "exogenous DNA sequence", "heterologous RNA sequence", "exogenous RNA
     sequence" or "heterologous nucleic acid" each refer to a sequence that either
20   originates from a source foreign to the particular host cell, or is from the same
     source but is modified from its original or native form. Thus, a heterologous
     gene in a host cell includes a gene that is endogenous to the particular host cell
     but has been modified through, for example, the use of DNA shuffling. The
     terms also include non-naturally occurring multiple copies of a naturally
25   occurring DNA or RNA sequence. Thus, the terms refer to a DNA or RNA
     segment that is foreign or heterologous to the cell, or homologous to the cell but
     in a position within the host cell nucleic acid in which the element is not
     ordinarily found. Exogenous DNA segments are expressed to yield exogenous
     polypeptides.
30           A "homologous" DNA or RNA sequence is a sequence that is naturally
     associated with a host cell into which it is introduced.
             "Wild-type" refers to the normal gene or organism found in nature.
             "Genome" refers to the complete genetic material of an organism.

             A "vector" is defined to include, inter alia, any viral vector, as well as
     any plasmid, cosmid, phage or binary vector in double or single stranded linear
     or circular form that may or may not be self transmissible or mobilizable, and
     that can transform prokaryotic or eukaryotic host either by integration into the
 5   cellular genome or exist extrachromosomally (e.g., autonomous replicating
     plasmid with an origin of replication).
             "Expression cassette" as used herein means a nucleic acid sequence
     capable of directing expression of a particular nucleotide sequence in an
     appropriate host cell, which may include a promoter operably linked to the
10   nucleotide sequence of interest that may be operably linked to termination
     signals. The coding region usually codes for a functional RNA of interest, for
     example an siRNA. The expression cassette including the nucleotide sequence of
     interest may be chimeric. The expression cassette may also be one that is
     naturally occurring but has been obtained in a recombinant form useful for
15   heterologous expression. The expression of the nucleotide sequence in the
     expression cassette may be under the control of a constitutive promoter or of a
     regulatable promoter that initiates transcription only when the host cell is
     exposed to some particular stimulus. In the case of a multicellular organism, the
     promoter can also be specific to a particular tissue or organ or stage of
20   development.
              Such expression cassettes can include a transcriptional initiation region
     linked to a nucleotide sequence of interest. Such an expression cassette is
     provided with a plurality of restriction sites for insertion of the gene of interest to
     be under the transcriptional regulation of the regulatory regions. The expression
25   cassette may additionally contain selectable marker genes.
              "Coding sequence" refers to a DNA or RNA sequence that codes for a
     specific amino acid sequence. It may constitute an "uninterrupted coding
     sequence", i.e., lacking an intron, such as in a cDNA, or it may include one or
     more introns bounded by appropriate splice junctions. An "intron" is a sequence
30   of RNA that is contained in the primary transcript but is removed through
     cleavage and re-ligation of the RNA within the cell to create the mature mRNA
     that can be translated into a protein.

              The term "open reading frame" (ORF) refers to the sequence between
    translation initiation and termination codons of a coding sequence. The terms
     "initiation codon" and "termination codon" refer to a unit of three adjacent
    nucleotides (a 'codon') in a coding sequence that specifies initiation and chain
 5  termination, respectively, of protein synthesis (mRNA translation).
              "Functional RNA" refers to sense RNA, antisense RNA, ribozyme RNA,
    siRNA, or other RNA that may not be translated but yet has an effect on at least
    one cellular process.
              The term "RNA transcript" or "transcript" refers to the product resulting
10  from RNA polymerase catalyzed transcription of a DNA sequence. When the
    RNA transcript is a perfect complementary copy of the DNA sequence, it is
    referred to as the primary transcript or it may be a RNA sequence derived from
    posttranscriptional processing of the primary transcript and is referred to as the
    mature RNA. "Messenger RNA" (mRNA) refers to the RNA that is without
15  introns and that can be translated into protein by the cell.
              "cDNA" refers to a single- or a double-stranded DNA that is
     complementary to and derived from mRNA.
              "Regulatory sequences" are nucleotide sequences located upstream (5'
    non-coding sequences), within, or downstream (3' non-coding sequences) of a
20   coding sequence, and which influence the transcription, RNA processing or
     stability, or translation of the associated coding sequence. Regulatory sequences
     include enhancers, promoters, translation leader sequences, introns, and
    polyadenylation signal sequences. They include natural and synthetic sequences
     as well as sequences that may be a combination of synthetic and natural
25   sequences. As is noted herein, the term "suitable regulatory sequences" is not
     limited to promoters. However, some suitable regulatory sequences useful in the
    present invention will include, but are not limited to constitutive promoters,
    tissue-specific promoters, development-specific promoters, regulatable
    promoters and viral promoters.
30            "5' non-coding sequence" refers to a nucleotide sequence located 5'
     (upstream) to the coding sequence. It is present in the fully processed mRNA
    upstream of the initiation codon and may affect processing of the primary
    transcript to mRNA, mRNA stability or translation efficiency.

             "3' non-coding sequence" refers to nucleotide sequences located 3'
     (downstream) to a coding sequence and may include polyadenylation signal
     sequences and other sequences encoding regulatory signals capable of affecting
     mRNA processing or gene expression. The polyadenylation signal is usually
 5   characterized by affecting the addition of polyadenylic acid tracts to the 3' end of
     the mRNA precursor.
             The term "translation leader sequence" refers to that DNA sequence
     portion of a gene between the promoter and coding sequence that is transcribed
     into RNA and is present in the fully processed mRNA upstream (5') of the
10   translation start codon. The translation leader sequence may affect processing of
     the primary transcript to mRNA, mRNA stability or translation efficiency.
             The term "mature" protein refers to a post-translationally processed
     polypeptide without its signal peptide. "Precursor" protein refers to the primary
     product of translation of an mRNA. "Signal peptide" refers to the amino
15   terminal extension of a polypeptide, which is translated in conjunction with the
     polypeptide forming a precursor peptide and which is required for its entrance
     into the secretory pathway. The term "signal sequence" refers to a nucleotide
     sequence that encodes the signal peptide.
             "Promoter" refers to a nucleotide sequence, usually upstream (5') to its
20   coding sequence, which directs and/or controls the expression of the coding
     sequence by providing the recognition for RNA polymerase and other factors
     required for proper transcription. "Promoter" includes a minimal promoter that is
     a short DNA sequence comprised of a TATA- box and other sequences that
     serve to specify the site of transcription initiation, to which regulatory elements
25   are added for control of expression. "Promoter" also refers to a nucleotide
     sequence that includes a minimal promoter plus regulatory elements that is
     capable of controlling the expression of a coding sequence or functional RNA.
     This type of promoter sequence consists of proximal and more distal upstream
     elements, the latter elements often referred to as enhancers. Accordingly, an
30   "enhancer" is a DNA sequence that can stimulate promoter activity and may be
     an innate element of the promoter or a heterologous element inserted to enhance
     the level or tissue specificity of a promoter. It is capable of operating in both
     orientations (normal or flipped), and is capable of functioning even when moved
                                               46

WO 2008/150897                                                            PCT/US2008/065130
     either upstream or downstream from the promoter. Both enhancers and other
     upstream promoter elements bind sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins that
     mediate their effects. Promoters may be derived in their entirety from a native
     gene, or be composed of different elements derived from different promoters
 5   found in nature, or even be comprised of synthetic DNA segments. A promoter
     may also contain DNA sequences that are involved in the binding of protein
     factors that control the effectiveness of transcription initiation in response to
     physiological or developmental conditions. Examples of promoters that may be
     used in the present invention include the mouse U6 RNA promoters, synthetic
10   human H1RNA promoters, SV40, CMV, RSV, RNA polymerase II and RNA
     polymerase III promoters.
              The "initiation site" is the position surrounding the first nucleotide that is
     part of the transcribed sequence, which is also defined as position +1. With
     respect to this site all other sequences of the gene and its controlling regions are
15   numbered. Downstream sequences (i.e., further protein encoding sequences in
     the 3' direction) are denominated positive, while upstream sequences (mostly of
     the controlling regions in the 5' direction) are denominated negative.
             Promoter elements, particularly a TATA element, that are inactive or that
     have greatly reduced promoter activity in the absence of upstream activation are
20   referred to as "minimal or core promoters." In the presence of a suitable
     transcription factor, the minimal promoter functions to permit transcription. A
     "minimal or core promoter" thus consists only of all basal elements needed for
     transcription initiation, e.g., a TATA box and/or an initiator.
             "Constitutive expression" refers to expression using a constitutive or
25   regulated promoter. "Conditional" and "regulated expression" refer to
     expression controlled by a regulated promoter.
             "Operably-linked" refers to the association of nucleic acid sequences on
     single nucleic acid fragment so that the function of one of the sequences is
     affected by another. For example, a regulatory DNA sequence is said to be
30   "operably linked to" or "associated with" a DNA sequence that codes for an
     RNA or a polypeptide if the two sequences are situated such that the regulatory
     DNA sequence affects expression of the coding DNA sequence (i.e., that the
     coding sequence or functional RNA is under the transcriptional control of the
                                                 47

 WO 2008/150897                                                          PCT/US2008/065130
      promoter). Coding sequences can be operably-linked to regulatory sequences in
      sense or antisense orientation.
              "Expression" refers to the transcription and/or translation of an
      endogenous gene, heterologous gene or nucleic acid segment, or a transgene in
  5   cells. For example, in the case of siRNA constructs, expression may refer to the
      transcription of the siRNA only. In addition, expression refers to the
      transcription and stable accumulation of sense (mRNA) or functional RNA.
      Expression may also refer to the production of protein.
              "Altered levels" refers to the level of expression in transgenic cells or
 10   organisms that differs from that of normal or untransformed cells or organisms.
              "Overexpression" refers to the level of expression in transgenic cells or
      organisms that exceeds levels of expression in normal or untransformed cells or
      organisms.
              "Antisense inhibition" refers to the production of antisense RNA
 15  transcripts capable of suppressing the expression of protein from an endogenous
      gene or a transgene.
              "Transcription stop fragment" refers to nucleotide sequences that contain
      one or more regulatory signals, such as polyadenylation signal sequences,
     capable of terminating transcription. Examples include the 3' non-regulatory
20   regions of genes encoding nopaline synthase and the small subunit of ribulose
     bisphosphate carboxylase.
              "Translation stop fragment" refers to nucleotide sequences that contain
     one or more regulatory signals, such as one or more termination codons in all
     three frames, capable of terminating translation. Insertion of a translation stop
25   fragment adjacent to or near the initiation codon at the 5' end of the coding
     sequence will result in no translation or improper translation. Excision of the
     translation stop fragment by site-specific recombination will leave a site-specific
     sequence in the coding sequence that does not interfere with proper translation
     using the initiation codon.
30            The terms "cis-acting sequence" and "cis-acting element" refer to DNA
     or RNA sequences whose functions require them to be on the same molecule.
     An example of a cis-acting sequence on the replicon is the viral replication
     origin.
                                               48

WO 2008/150897                                                         PCT/US2008/065130
              The terms "trans-actingsequence" and "trans-actingelement" refer to
     DNA or RNA sequences whose function does not require them to be on the same
     molecule.
              "Chromosomally-integrated" refers to the integration of a foreign gene or
 5   nucleic acid construct into the host DNA by covalent bonds. Where genes are
     not "chromosomally integrated" they may be "transiently expressed." Transient
     expression of a gene refers to the expression of a gene that is not integrated into
     the host chromosome but functions independently, either as part of an
     autonomously replicating plasmid or expression cassette, for example, or as part
10   of another biological system such as a virus.
              The following terms are used to describe the sequence relationships
     between two or more nucleic acids or polynucleotides: (a) "reference sequence,"
     (b) "comparison window," (c) "sequence identity," (d) "percentage of sequence
     identity," and (e) "substantial identity."
15            (a) As used herein, "reference sequence" is a defined sequence used as a
     basis for sequence comparison. A reference sequence may be a subset or the
     entirety of a specified sequence; for example, as a segment of a full-length
     cDNA or gene sequence, or the complete cDNA or gene sequence.
              (b) As used herein, "comparison window" makes reference to a
20   contiguous and specified segment of a polynucleotide sequence, wherein the
     polynucleotide sequence in the comparison window may comprise additions or
     deletions (i.e., gaps) compared to the reference sequence (which does not
     comprise additions or deletions) for optimal alignment of the two sequences.
     Generally, the comparison window is at least 20 contiguous nucleotides in
25   length, and optionally can be 30, 40, 50, 100, or longer. Those of skill in the art
     understand that to avoid a high similarity to a reference sequence due to
     inclusion of gaps in the polynucleotide sequence a gap penalty is typically
     introduced and is subtracted from the number of matches.
              Methods of alignment of sequences for comparison are well-known in
30   the art. Thus, the determination of percent identity between any two sequences
     can be accomplished using a mathematical algorithm.
              Computer implementations of these mathematical algorithms can be
     utilized for comparison of sequences to determine sequence identity. Such
                                                49

WO 2008/150897                                                          PCT/US2008/065130
     implementations include, but are not limited to: CLUSTAL in the PC/Gene
     program (available from Intelligenetics, Mountain View, California); the ALIGN
    program (Version 2.0) and GAP, BESTFIT, BLAST, FASTA, and TFASTA in
     the Wisconsin Genetics Software Package, Version 8 (available from Genetics
 5   Computer Group (GCG), 575 Science Drive, Madison, Wisconsin, USA).
     Alignments using these programs can be performed using the default parameters.
             Software for performing BLAST analyses is publicly available through
     the National Center for Biotechnology Information. This algorithm involves first
     identifying high scoring sequence pairs (HSPs) by identifying short words of
10   length W in the query sequence, which either match or satisfy some positive
     valued threshold score T when aligned with a word of the same length in a
     database sequence. T is referred to as the neighborhood word score threshold.
     These initial neighborhood word hits act as seeds for initiating searches to find
     longer HSPs containing them. The word hits are then extended in both directions
15   along each sequence for as far as the cumulative alignment score can be
     increased. Cumulative scores are calculated using, for nucleotide sequences, the
     parameters M (reward score for a pair of matching residues; always > 0) and N
     (penalty score for mismatching residues; always < 0). For amino acid
     sequences, a scoring matrix is used to calculate the cumulative score. Extension
20   of the word hits in each direction are halted when the cumulative alignment
     score falls off by the quantity X from its maximum achieved value, the
     cumulative score goes to zero or below due to the accumulation of one or more
     negative-scoring residue alignments, or the end of either sequence is reached.
             In addition to calculating percent sequence identity, the BLAST
25   algorithm also performs a statistical analysis of the similarity between two
     sequences. One measure of similarity provided by the BLAST algorithm is the
     smallest sum probability (P(N)), which provides an indication of the probability
     by which a match between two nucleotide sequences would occur by chance. For
     example, a test nucleic acid sequence is considered similar to a reference
30   sequence if the smallest sum probability in a comparison of the test nucleic acid
     sequence to the reference nucleic acid sequence is less than about 0.1, more
     preferably less than about 0.01, and most preferably less than about 0.001.

WO 2008/150897                                                          PCT/US2008/065130
             To obtain gapped alignments for comparison purposes, Gapped BLAST
     (in BLAST 2.0) can be utilized. Alternatively, PSI-BLAST (in BLAST 2.0) can
     be used to perform an iterated search that detects distant relationships between
     molecules. When utilizing BLAST, Gapped BLAST, PSI-BLAST, the default
 5  parameters of the respective programs (e.g. BLASTN for nucleotide sequences)
     can be used. The BLASTN program (for nucleotide sequences) uses as defaults
     a wordlength (W) of 11, an expectation (E) of 10, a cutoff of 100, M=5, N=-4,
     and a comparison of both strands. Alignment may also be performed manually
     by inspection.
10           For purposes of the present invention, comparison of nucleotide
     sequences for determination of percent sequence identity to the promoter
     sequences disclosed herein is preferably made using the BlastN program
     (version 1.4.7 or later) with its default parameters or any equivalent program.
     By "equivalent program" is intended any sequence comparison program that, for
15   any two sequences in question, generates an alignment having identical
     nucleotide matches and an identical percent sequence identity when compared to
     the corresponding alignment generated by the preferred program.
             (c) As used herein, "sequence identity" or "identity" in the context of two
     nucleic acid sequences makes reference to a specified percentage of nucleotides
20   in the two sequences that are the same when aligned for maximum
     correspondence over a specified comparison window, as measured by sequence
     comparison algorithms or by visual inspection.
             (d) As used herein, "percentage of sequence identity" means the value
     determined by comparing two optimally aligned sequences over a comparison
25   window, wherein the portion of the polynucleotide sequence in the comparison
     window may comprise additions or deletions (i.e., gaps) as compared to the
    reference sequence (which does not comprise additions or deletions) for optimal
     alignment of the two sequences. The percentage is calculated by determining the
    number of positions at which the identical nucleic acid base or amino acid
30  residue occurs in both sequences to yield the number of matched positions,
     dividing the number of matched positions by the total number of positions in the
    window of comparison, and multiplying the result by 100 to yield the percentage
     of sequence identity.

WO 2008/150897                                                         PCT/US2008/065130
             (e) The term "substantial identity" of polynucleotide sequences means
     that a polynucleotide comprises a sequence that has at least 70%, 71%, 72%,
     73%, 74%, 75%, 76%, 77%, 78%, or 79%, preferably at least 80%, 81%, 82%,
      83%, 84%, 85%, 86%, 87%, 88%, or 89%, more preferably at least 90%, 91%,
 5   92%, 93%, or 94%, and most preferably at least 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99%
     sequence identity, compared to a reference sequence using one of the alignment
     programs described using standard parameters.
             Another indication that nucleotide sequences are substantially identical is
     if two molecules hybridize to each other under stringent conditions. Generally,
10   stringent conditions are selected to be about 50 C lower than the thermal melting
     point (Tm) for the specific sequence at a defined ionic strength and pH.
     However, stringent conditions encompass temperatures in the range of about 10 C
     to about 20'C, depending upon the desired degree of stringency as otherwise
     qualified herein.
15           For sequence comparison, typically one sequence acts as a reference
     sequence to which test sequences are compared. When using a sequence
     comparison algorithm, test and reference sequences are input into a computer,
     subsequence coordinates are designated if necessary, and sequence algorithm
     program parameters are designated. The sequence comparison algorithm then
20   calculates the percent sequence identity for the test sequence(s) relative to the
     reference sequence, based on the designated program parameters.
             As noted herein, another indication that two nucleic acid sequences are
     substantially identical is that the two molecules hybridize to each other under
     stringent conditions. The phrase "hybridizing specifically to" refers to the
25   binding, duplexing, or hybridizing of a molecule only to a particular nucleotide
     sequence under stringent conditions when that sequence is present in a complex
     mixture (e.g., total cellular) DNA or RNA. "Bind(s) substantially" refers to
     complementary hybridization between a probe nucleic acid and a target nucleic
     acid and embraces minor mismatches that can be accommodated by reducing the
30   stringency of the hybridization media to achieve the desired detection of the
     target nucleic acid sequence.
             "Stringent hybridization conditions" and "stringent hybridization wash
     conditions" in the context of nucleic acid hybridization experiments such as
                                              52

WO 2008/150897                                                          PCT/US2008/065130
      Southern and Northern hybridizations are sequence dependent, and are different
     under different environmental parameters. Longer sequences hybridize
      specifically at higher temperatures. The Tm is the temperature (under defined
     ionic strength and pH) at which 50% of the target sequence hybridizes to a
 5   perfectly matched probe. Specificity is typically the function of post
     hybridization washes, the critical factors being the ionic strength and
     temperature of the final wash solution. For DNA-DNA hybrids, the Tm can be
     approximated from the equation of Meinkoth and Wahl (1984); Tm 81.5'C +
      16.6 (log M) +0.41 (%GC) - 0.61 (% form) - 500/L; where M is the molarity of
10   monovalent cations, %GC is the percentage of guanosine and cytosine
     nucleotides in the DNA, % form is the percentage of formamide in the
     hybridization solution, and L is the length of the hybrid in base pairs. Tm is
     reduced by about 1C for each 1%of mismatching; thus, Tm, hybridization,
     and/or wash conditions can be adjusted to hybridize to sequences of the desired
15   identity. For example, if sequences with >90% identity are sought, the Tm can
     be decreased 10 C. Generally, stringent conditions are selected to be about 5*C
     lower than the thermal melting point (Tm) for the specific sequence and its
     complement at a defined ionic strength and pH. However, severely stringent
     conditions can utilize a hybridization and/or wash at 1, 2, 3, or 4'C lower than
20   the thermal melting point (Tm); moderately stringent conditions can utilize a
     hybridization and/or wash at 6, 7, 8, 9, or 100 C lower than the thermal melting
     point (Tm); low stringency conditions can utilize a hybridization and/or wash at
      11, 12, 13, 14, 15, or 20'C lower than the thermal melting point (Tm). Using the
     equation, hybridization and wash compositions, and desired T, those of ordinary
25   skill will understand that variations in the stringency of hybridization and/or
     wash solutions are inherently described. If the desired degree of mismatching
     results in a T of less than 45'C (aqueous solution) or 32'C (formamide
     solution), it is preferred to increase the SSC concentration so that a higher
     temperature can be used. Generally, highly stringent hybridization and wash
30   conditions are selected to be about 5C lower than the thermal melting point
     (Tm) for the specific sequence at a defined ionic strength and pH.
              An example of highly stringent wash conditions is 0.15 M NaCl at 72'C
     for about 15 minutes. An example of stringent wash conditions is a 0.2X SSC
                                                53

WO 2008/150897                                                          PCT/US2008/065130
     wash at 650 C for 15 minutes (see, Sambrook and Russell 2001, for a description
     of SSC buffer). Often, a high stringency wash is preceded by a low stringency
     wash to remove background probe signal. For short nucleic acid sequences (e.g.,
     about 10 to 50 nucleotides), stringent conditions typically involve salt
 5   concentrations of less than about 1.5 M, more preferably about 0.01 to 1.0 M, Na
     ion concentration (or other salts) at pH 7.0 to 8.3, and the temperature is
     typically at least about 30'C. Stringent conditions may also be achieved with the
     addition of destabilizing agents such as formamide. In general, a signal to noise
     ratio of 2X (or higher) than that observed for an unrelated probe in the particular
10   hybridization assay indicates detection of a specific hybridization. Very
     stringent conditions are selected to be equal to the Tm for a particular nucleic
     acid molecule.
              Very stringent conditions are selected to be equal to the Tm for a
     particular probe. An example of stringent conditions for hybridization of
15   complementary nucleic acids which have more than 100 complementary residues
     on a filter in a Southern or Northern blot is 50% formamide, e.g., hybridization
     in 50% formamide, 1 M NaCl, 1%SDS at 370 C, and a wash in 0.1X SSC at 60
     to 65'C. Exemplary low stringency conditions include hybridization with a
     buffer solution of 30 to 35% formamide, IM NaCl, 1%SDS (sodium dodecyl
20   sulfate) at 370 C, and a wash in 1X to 2X SSC (20X SSC = 3.0 M NaCl/0.3 M
     trisodium citrate) at 50 to 55'C. Exemplary moderate stringency conditions
     include hybridization in 40 to 45% formamide, 1.0 M NaCl, 1%SDS at 370 C,
     and a wash in 0.5X to IX SSC at 55 to 60'C.
              The term "transformation" refers to the transfer of a nucleic acid
25   fragment into the genome of a host cell, resulting in genetically stable
     inheritance. A "host cell" is a cell that has been transformed, or is capable of
     transformation, by an exogenous nucleic acid molecule. Host cells containing the
     transformed nucleic acid fragments are referred to as "transgenic" cells.
              "Transformed," "transduced," "transgenic" and "recombinant" refer to a
30   host cell into which a heterologous nucleic acid molecule has been introduced.
     As used herein the term "transfection" refers to the delivery of DNA into
     eukaryotic (e.g., mammalian) cells. The term "transformation" is used herein to
     refer to delivery of DNA into prokaryotic (e.g., E. coli) cells. The term
                                               54

WO 2008/150897                                                           PCT/US2008/065130
      "transduction" is used herein to refer to infecting cells with viral particles. The
     nucleic acid molecule can be stably integrated into the genome generally known
      in the art. Known methods of PCR include, but are not limited to, methods using
     paired primers, nested primers, single specific primers, degenerate primers,
 5    gene-specific primers, vector-specific primers, partially mismatched primers,
      and the like. For example, "transformed," "transformant," and "transgenic" cells
     have been through the transformation process and contain a foreign gene
      integrated into their chromosome. The term "untransformed" refers to normal
     cells that have not been through the transformation process.
10            "Genetically altered cells" denotes cells which have been modified by the
     introduction of recombinant or heterologous nucleic acids (e.g., one or more
     DNA constructs or their RNA counterparts) and further includes the progeny of
      such cells which retain part or all of such genetic modification.
              As used herein, the term "derived" or "directed to" with respect to a
15   nucleotide molecule means that the molecule has complementary sequence
     identity to a particular molecule of interest.
              The siRNAs of the present invention can be generated by any method
     known to the art, for example, by in vitro transcription, recombinantly, or by
     synthetic means. In one example, the siRNAs can be generated in vitro by using
20   a recombinant enzyme, such as T7 RNA polymerase, and DNA oligonucleotide
     templates.
              11.     Nucleic Acid Molecules of the Invention
              The terms "isolated and/or purified" refer to in vitro isolation of a nucleic
25   acid, e.g., a DNA or RNA molecule from its natural cellular environment, and
     from association with other components of the cell, such as nucleic acid or
     polypeptide, so that it can be sequenced, replicated, and/or expressed. The RNA
     or DNA is "isolated" in that it is free from at least one contaminating nucleic
     acid with which it is normally associated in the natural source of the RNA or
30   DNA and is preferably substantially free of any other mammalian RNA or DNA.
     The phrase "free from at least one contaminating source nucleic acid with which
     it is normally associated" includes the case where the nucleic acid is
     reintroduced into the source or natural cell but is in a different chromosomal
                                                55

WO 2008/150897                                                           PCT/US2008/065130
     location or is otherwise flanked by nucleic acid sequences not normally found in
     the source cell, e.g., in a vector or plasmid.
              In addition to a DNA sequence encoding a siRNA, the nucleic acid
     molecules of the invention include double-stranded interfering RNA molecules,
 5   which are also useful to inhibit expression of a target gene.
              As used herein, the term "recombinant nucleic acid", e.g., "recombinant
     DNA sequence or segment" refers to a nucleic acid, e.g., to DNA, that has been
     derived or isolated from any appropriate cellular source, that may be
     subsequently chemically altered in vitro, so that its sequence is not naturally
10   occurring, or corresponds to naturally occurring sequences that are not
     positioned as they would be positioned in a genome which has not been
     transformed with exogenous DNA. An example of preselected DNA "derived"
     from a source would be a DNA sequence that is identified as a useful fragment
     within a given organism, and which is then chemically synthesized in essentially
15   pure form. An example of such DNA "isolated" from a source would be a useful
     DNA sequence that is excised or removed from said source by chemical means,
     e.g., by the use of restriction endonucleases, so that it can be further
     manipulated, e.g., amplified, for use in the invention, by the methodology of
     genetic engineering.
20            Thus, recovery or isolation of a given fragment of DNA from a
     restriction digest can employ separation of the digest on polyacrylamide or
     agarose gel by electrophoresis, identification of the fragment of interest by
     comparison of its mobility versus that of marker DNA fragments of known
     molecular weight, removal of the gel section containing the desired fragment,
25   and separation of the gel from DNA. Therefore, "recombinant DNA" includes
     completely synthetic DNA sequences, semi-synthetic DNA sequences, DNA
     sequences isolated from biological sources, and DNA sequences derived from
     RNA, as well as mixtures thereof.
              Nucleic acid molecules having base substitutions (i.e., variants) are
30   prepared by a variety of methods known in the art. These methods include, but
     are not limited to, isolation from a natural source (in the case of naturally
     occurring sequence variants) or preparation by oligonucleotide-mediated (or
                                                56

WO 2008/150897                                                         PCT/US2008/065130
     site-directed) mutagenesis, PCR mutagenesis, and cassette mutagenesis of an
     earlier prepared variant or a non-variant version of the nucleic acid molecule.
              Oligonucleotide-mediated mutagenesis is a method for preparing
     substitution variants. This technique is known in the art. Briefly, nucleic acid
 5   encoding a siRNA can be altered by hybridizing an oligonucleotide encoding the
     desired mutation to a DNA template, where the template is the single-stranded
     form of a plasmid or bacteriophage containing the unaltered or native gene
     sequence. After hybridization, a DNA polymerase is used to synthesize an entire
     second complementary strand of the template that will thus incorporate the
10   oligonucleotide primer, and will code for the selected alteration in the nucleic
     acid encoding siRNA. The oligonucleotides are readily synthesized using
     techniques known in the art.
              The DNA template can be generated by those vectors that are either
     derived from bacteriophage M13 vectors (the commercially available M13mp18
15   and Ml3mp19 vectors are suitable), or those vectors that contain a
     single-stranded phage origin of replication. Thus, the DNA that is to be mutated
     may be inserted into one of these vectors to generate single-stranded template.
     Production of the single-stranded template is described in Chapter 3 of
     Sambrook and Russell, 2001. Alternatively, single-stranded DNA template may
20   be generated by denaturing double-stranded plasmid (or other) DNA using
     standard techniques.
              For alteration of the native DNA sequence (to generate amino acid
     sequence variants, for example), the oligonucleotide is hybridized to the
     single-stranded template under suitable hybridization conditions. A DNA
25   polymerizing enzyme, usually the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I, is
     then added to synthesize the complementary strand of the template using the
     oligonucleotide as a primer for synthesis. A heteroduplex molecule is thus
     formed such that one strand of DNA encodes the mutated form of the DNA, and
     the other strand (the original template) encodes the native, unaltered sequence of
30   the DNA. This heteroduplex molecule is then transformed into a suitable host
     cell, usually a prokaryote such as E. coli JM101. After the cells are grown, they
     are plated onto agarose plates and screened using the oligonucleotide primer
     radiolabeled with 32-phosphate to identify the bacterial colonies that contain the
                                              57

 WO 2008/150897                                                        PCT/US2008/065130
       mutated DNA. The mutated region is then removed and placed in an appropriate
      vector, generally an expression vector of the type typically employed for
      transformation of an appropriate host.
              The method described immediately above may be modified such that a
  5   homoduplex molecule is created wherein both strands of the plasmid contain the
      mutations(s). The modifications are as follows: The single-stranded
      oligonucleotide is annealed to the single-stranded template as described herein.
      A mixture of three deoxyribonucleotides, deoxyriboadenosine (dATP),
      deoxyriboguanosine (dGTP), and deoxyribothymidine (dTTP), is combined with
 10   a modified thiodeoxyribocytosine called dCTP-(*S) (which can be obtained from
      the Amersham Corporation). This mixture is added to the
      template-oligonucleotide complex. Upon addition of DNA polymerase to this
      mixture, a strand of DNA identical to the template except for the mutated bases
      is generated. In addition, this new strand of DNA will contain dCTP-(*S)
 15   instead of dCTP, which serves to protect it from restriction endonuclease
      digestion.
              After the template strand of the double-stranded heteroduplex is nicked
     with an appropriate restriction enzyme, the template strand can be digested with
     ExoIII nuclease or another appropriate nuclease past the region that contains the
20   site(s) to be mutagenized. The reaction is then stopped to leave a molecule that
     is only partially single-stranded. A complete double-stranded DNA homoduplex
     is then formed using DNA polymerase in the presence of all four
     deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates, ATP, and DNA ligase. This homoduplex
     molecule can then be transformed into a suitable host cell such as E. coli JM 101.

               I1.    Expression Cassettes of the Invention
              To prepare expression cassettes, the recombinant DNA sequence or
     segment may be circular or linear, double-stranded or single-stranded.
     Generally, the DNA sequence or segment is in the form of chimeric DNA, such
30   as plasmid DNA or a vector that can also contain coding regions flanked by
     control sequences that promote the expression of the recombinant DNA present
     in the resultant transformed cell.
                                              58

WO 2008/150897                                                            PCT/US2008/065130
               A "chimeric" vector or expression cassette, as used herein, means a
     vector or cassette including nucleic acid sequences from at least two different
     species, or has a nucleic acid sequence from the same species that is linked or
     associated in a manner that does not occur in the "native" or wild type of the
 5   species.
               Aside from recombinant DNA sequences that serve as transcription units
     for an RNA transcript, or portions thereof, a portion of the recombinant DNA
     may be untranscribed, serving a regulatory or a structural function. For example,
     the recombinant DNA may have a promoter that is active in mammalian cells.
10             Other elements functional in the host cells, such as introns, enhancers,
     polyadenylation sequences and the like, may also be a part of the recombinant
     DNA. Such elements may or may not be necessary for the function of the DNA,
     but may provide improved expression of the DNA by affecting transcription,
     stability of the siRNA, or the like. Such elements may be included in the DNA
15   as desired to obtain the optimal performance of the siRNA in the cell.
               Control sequences are DNA sequences necessary for the expression of an
     operably linked coding sequence in a particular host organism. The control
     sequences that are suitable for prokaryotic cells, for example, include a
     promoter, and optionally an operator sequence, and a ribosome binding site.
20   Eukaryotic cells are known to utilize promoters, polyadenylation signals, and
     enhancers.
               Operably linked nucleic acids are nucleic acids placed in a functional
     relationship with another nucleic acid sequence. For example, a promoter or
     enhancer is operably linked to a coding sequence if it affects the transcription of
25   the sequence; or a ribosome binding site is operably linked to a coding sequence
     if it is positioned so as to facilitate translation. Generally, operably linked DNA
     sequences are DNA sequences that are linked are contiguous. However,
     enhancers do not have to be contiguous. Linking is accomplished by ligation at
     convenient restriction sites. If such sites do not exist, the synthetic
30   oligonucleotide adaptors or linkers are used in accord with conventional practice.
               The recombinant DNA to be introduced into the cells may contain either
     a selectable marker gene or a reporter gene or both to facilitate identification and
     selection of expressing cells from the population of cells sought to be transfected
                                                  59

WO 2008/150897                                                           PCT/US2008/065130
     or infected through viral vectors. In other embodiments, the selectable marker
     may be carried on a separate piece of DNA and used in a co-transfection
     procedure. Both selectable markers and reporter genes may be flanked with
     appropriate regulatory sequences to enable expression in the host cells. Useful
 5   selectable markers are known in the art and include, for example, antibiotic
     resistance genes, such as neo and the like.
             Reporter genes are used for identifying potentially transfected cells and
     for evaluating the functionality of regulatory sequences. Reporter genes that
     encode for easily assayable proteins are well known in the art. In general, a
10   reporter gene is a gene that is not present in or expressed by the recipient
     organism or tissue and that encodes a protein whose expression is manifested by
     some easily detectable property, e.g., enzymatic activity. For example, reporter
     genes include the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase gene (cat) from Tn9 of E.
     coli and the luciferase gene from firefly Photinuspyralis. Expression of the
15   reporter gene is assayed at a suitable time after the DNA has been introduced
     into the recipient cells.
             The general methods for constructing recombinant DNA that can
     transfect target cells are well known to those skilled in the art, and the same
     compositions and methods of construction may be utilized to produce the DNA
20   useful herein.
             The recombinant DNA can be readily introduced into the host cells, e.g.,
     mammalian, bacterial, yeast or insect cells by transfection with an expression
     vector composed of DNA encoding the siRNA by any procedure useful for the
     introduction into a particular cell, e.g., physical or biological methods, to yield a
25   cell having the recombinant DNA stably integrated into its genome or existing as
     a episomal element, so that the DNA molecules, or sequences of the present
     invention are expressed by the host cell. Preferably, the DNA is introduced into
     host cells via a vector. The host cell is preferably of eukaryotic origin, e.g.,
     plant, mammalian, insect, yeast or fungal sources, but host cells of non
30   eukaryotic origin may also be employed.
             Physical methods to introduce a preselected DNA into a host cell include
     calcium phosphate precipitation, lipofection, particle bombardment,
     microinjection, electroporation, and the like. Biological methods to introduce
                                                60

 WO 2008/150897                                                          PCT/US2008/065130
        the DNA of interest into a host cell include the use of DNA and RNA viral
        vectors. For mammalian gene therapy, as described herein below, it is desirable
        to use an efficient means of inserting a copy gene into the host genome. Viral
        vectors, and especially retroviral vectors, have become the most widely used
  5     method for inserting genes into mammalian, e.g., human cells. Other viral
       vectors can be derived from poxviruses, herpes simplex virus I, adenoviruses and
       adeno-associated viruses, and the like. See, for example, U.S. Patent Nos.
        5,350,674 and 5,585,362.
                As discussed herein, a "transfected", "or "transduced" host cell or cell
 10    line is one in which the genome has been altered or augmented by the presence
       of at least one heterologous or recombinant nucleic acid sequence. The host
       cells of the present invention are typically produced by transfection with a DNA
       sequence in a plasmid expression vector, a viral expression vector, or as an
       isolated linear DNA sequence. The transfected DNA can become a
 15    chromosomally integrated recombinant DNA sequence, which is composed of
       sequence encoding the siRNA.
               To confirm the presence of the recombinant DNA sequence in the host
      cell, a variety of assays may be performed. Such assays include, for example,
      "molecular biological" assays well known to those of skill in the art, such as
20    Southern and Northern blotting, RT-PCR and PCR; "biochemical" assays, such
      as detecting the presence or absence of a particular peptide, e.g., by
      immunological means (ELISAs and Western blots) or by assays described herein
      to identify agents falling within the scope of the invention.
               To detect and quantitate RNA produced from introduced recombinant
25    DNA segments, RT-PCR may be employed. In this application of PCR, it is
      first necessary to reverse transcribe RNA into DNA, using enzymes such as
     reverse transcriptase, and then through the use of conventional PCR techniques
     amplify the DNA. In most instances PCR techniques, while useful, will not
     demonstrate integrity of the RNA product. Further information about the nature
30   of the RNA product may be obtained by Northern blotting. This technique
     demonstrates the presence of an RNA species and gives information about the
     integrity of that RNA. The presence or absence of an RNA species can also be
     determined using dot or slot blot Northern hybridizations. These techniques are
                                                61

WO 2008/150897                                                            PCT/US2008/065130
     modifications of Northern blotting and only demonstrate the presence or absence
     of an RNA species.
              While Southern blotting and PCR may be used to detect the recombinant
     DNA segment in question, they do not provide information as to whether the
 5   preselected DNA segment is being expressed. Expression may be evaluated by
     specifically identifying the peptide products of the introduced recombinant DNA
     sequences or evaluating the phenotypic changes brought about by the expression
     of the introduced recombinant DNA segment in the host cell.
              The instant invention provides a cell expression system for expressing
10   exogenous nucleic acid material in a mammalian recipient. The expression
     system, also referred to as a "genetically modified cell," comprises a cell and an
     expression vector for expressing the exogenous nucleic acid material. The
     genetically modified cells are suitable for administration to a mammalian
     recipient, where they replace the endogenous cells of the recipient. Thus, the
15   preferred genetically modified cells are non-immortalized and are non
     tumorigenic.
             According to one embodiment, the cells are transfected or otherwise
     genetically modified ex vivo. The cells are isolated from a mammal (preferably
     a human), nucleic acid introduced (i.e., transduced or transfected in vitro) with a
20   vector for expressing a heterologous (e.g., recombinant) gene encoding the
     therapeutic agent, and then administered to a mammalian recipient for delivery
     of the therapeutic agent in situ. The mammalian recipient may be a human and
     the cells to be modified are autologous cells, i.e., the cells are isolated from the
     mammalian recipient.
25           According to another embodiment, the cells are transfected or transduced
     or otherwise genetically modified in vivo. The cells from the mammalian
     recipient are transduced or transfected in vivo with a vector containing
     exogenous nucleic acid material for expressing a heterologous (e.g.,
    recombinant) gene encoding a therapeutic agent and the therapeutic agent is
30   delivered in situ.
             As used herein, "exogenous nucleic acid material" refers to a nucleic acid
     or an oligonucleotide, either natural or synthetic, which is not naturally found in
    the cells; or if it is naturally found in the cells, is modified from its original or
                                                62

WO 2008/150897                                                          PCT/US2008/065130
      native form. Thus, "exogenous nucleic acid material" includes, for example, a
      non-naturally occurring nucleic acid that can be transcribed into an anti-sense
      RNA, a siRNA, as well as a "heterologous gene" (i.e., a gene encoding a protein
     that is not expressed or is expressed at biologically insignificant levels in a
  5  naturally-occurring cell of the same type). To illustrate, a synthetic or natural
      gene encoding human erythropoietin (EPO) would be considered "exogenous
     nucleic acid material" with respect to human peritoneal mesothelial cells since
     the latter cells do not naturally express EPO. Still another example of
      "exogenous nucleic acid material" is the introduction of only part of a gene to
 10  create a recombinant gene, such as combining an regulatable promoter with an
     endogenous coding sequence via homologous recombination.
              The condition amenable to gene inhibition therapy may be a prophylactic
     process, i.e., a process for preventing disease or an undesired medical condition.
     Thus, the instant invention embraces a system for delivering siRNA that has a
 15  prophylactic function (i.e., a prophylactic agent) to the mammalian recipient.
              IV.     Methods for Introducing the Expression Cassettes of the
                      Invention into Cells
              The inhibitory nucleic acid material (e.g., an expression cassette
20   encoding siRNA directed to a gene of interest) can be introduced into the cell ex
     vivo or in vivo by genetic transfer methods, such as transfection or transduction,
    to provide a genetically modified cell. Various expression vectors (i.e., vehicles
     for facilitating delivery of exogenous nucleic acid into a target cell) are known to
     one of ordinary skill in the art.
25           As used herein, "transfection of cells" refers to the acquisition by a cell
    of new nucleic acid material by incorporation of added DNA. Thus, transfection
    refers to the insertion of nucleic acid into a cell using physical or chemical
    methods. Several transfection techniques are known to those of ordinary skill in
    the art including calcium phosphate DNA co-precipitation, DEAE-dextran,
30  electroporation, cationic liposome-mediated transfection, tungsten particle
    facilitated microparticle bombardment, and strontium phosphate DNA co
    precipitation.
                                               63

WO 2008/150897                                                            PCT/US2008/065130
              In contrast, "transduction of cells" refers to the process of transferring
     nucleic acid into a cell using a DNA or RNA virus. A RNA virus (i.e., a
     retrovirus) for transferring a nucleic acid into a cell is referred to herein as a
     transducing chimeric retrovirus. Exogenous nucleic acid material contained
  5  within the retrovirus is incorporated into the genome of the transduced cell. A
     cell that has been transduced with a chimeric DNA virus (e.g., an adenovirus
     carrying a cDNA encoding a therapeutic agent), will not have the exogenous
     nucleic acid material incorporated into its genome but will be capable of
     expressing the exogenous nucleic acid material that is retained
 10  extrachromosomally within the cell.
              The exogenous nucleic acid material can include the nucleic acid
     encoding the siRNA together with a promoter to control transcription. The
     promoter characteristically has a specific nucleotide sequence necessary to
     initiate transcription. The exogenous nucleic acid material may further include
 15  additional sequences (i.e., enhancers) required to obtain the desired gene
     transcription activity. For the purpose of this discussion an "enhancer" is simply
     any non-translated DNA sequence that works with the coding sequence (in cis)
     to change the basal transcription level dictated by the promoter. The exogenous
     nucleic acid material may be introduced into the cell genome immediately
20   downstream from the promoter so that the promoter and coding sequence are
     operatively linked so as to permit transcription of the coding sequence. An
     expression vector can include an exogenous promoter element to control
     transcription of the inserted exogenous gene. Such exogenous promoters include
     both constitutive and regulatable promoters.
25            Naturally-occurring constitutive promoters control the expression of
     essential cell functions. As a result, a nucleic acid sequence under the control of
     a constitutive promoter is expressed under all conditions of cell growth.
     Constitutive promoters include the promoters for the following genes which
     encode certain constitutive or "housekeeping" functions: hypoxanthine
30   phosphoribosyl transferase (HPRT), dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), adenosine
     deaminase, phosphoglycerol kinase (PGK), pyruvate kinase, phosphoglycerol
     mutase, the beta-actin promoter, and other constitutive promoters known to those
     of skill in the art. In addition, many viral promoters function constitutively in
                                               64

WO 2008/150897                                                          PCT/US2008/065130
      eukaryotic cells. These include: the early and late promoters of SV40; the long
      terminal repeats (LTRs) of Moloney Leukemia Virus and other retroviruses; and
      the thymidine kinase promoter of Herpes Simplex Virus, among many others.
              Nucleic acid sequences that are under the control of regulatable
  5   promoters are expressed only or to a greater or lesser degree in the presence of
      an inducing or repressing agent, (e.g., transcription under control of the
      metallothionein promoter is greatly increased in presence of certain metal ions).
     Regulatable promoters include responsive elements (REs) that stimulate
     transcription when their inducing factors are bound. For example, there are REs
 10  for serum factors, steroid hormones, retinoic acid, cyclic AMP, and tetracycline
     and doxycycline. Promoters containing a particular RE can be chosen in order to
     obtain an regulatable response and in some cases, the RE itself may be attached
     to a different promoter, thereby conferring regulatability to the encoded nucleic
     acid sequence. Thus, by selecting the appropriate promoter (constitutive versus
15   regulatable; strong versus weak), it is possible to control both the existence and
     level of expression of a nucleic acid sequence in the genetically modified cell. If
     the nucleic acid sequence is under the control of an regulatable promoter,
     delivery of the therapeutic agent in situ is triggered by exposing the genetically
     modified cell in situ to conditions for permitting transcription of the nucleic acid
20   sequence, e.g., by intraperitoneal injection of specific inducers of the regulatable
     promoters which control transcription of the agent. For example, in situ
     expression of a nucleic acid sequence under the control of the metallothionein
     promoter in genetically modified cells is enhanced by contacting the genetically
     modified cells with a solution containing the appropriate (i.e., inducing) metal
25   ions in situ.
             Accordingly, the amount of siRNA generated in situ is regulated by
     controlling such factors as the nature of the promoter used to direct transcription
     of the nucleic acid sequence, (i.e., whether the promoter is constitutive or
    regulatable, strong or weak) and the number of copies of the exogenous nucleic
30  acid sequence encoding a siRNA sequence that are in the cell.
             In addition to at least one promoter and at least one heterologous nucleic
    acid sequence encoding the siRNA, the expression vector may include a
                                               65

WO 2008/150897                                                          PCT/US2008/065130
      selection gene, for example, a neomycin resistance gene, for facilitating selection
      of cells that have been transfected or transduced with the expression vector.
               Cells can also be transfected with two or more expression vectors, at least
     one vector containing the nucleic acid sequence(s) encoding the siRNA(s), the
  5  other vector containing a selection gene. The selection of a suitable promoter,
     enhancer, selection gene, and/or signal sequence is deemed to be within the
     scope of one of ordinary skill in the art without undue experimentation.
              The following discussion is directed to various utilities of the instant
     invention. For example, the instant invention has utility as an expression system
 10  suitable for silencing the expression of gene(s) of interest.
              The instant invention also provides methods for genetically modifying
     cells of a mammalian recipient in vivo. According to one embodiment, the
     method comprises introducing an expression vector for expressing a siRNA
     sequence in cells of the mammalian recipient in situ by, for example, injecting
15   the vector into the recipient.
              V.      Delivery Vehicles for the Expression Cassettes of the
     Invention
              Delivery of compounds into tissues and across the blood-brain barrier
20   can be limited by the size and biochemical properties of the compounds.
     Currently, efficient delivery of compounds into cells in vivo can be achieved
     only when the molecules are small (usually less than 600 Daltons). Gene
    transfer for the correction of inborn errors of metabolism and neurodegenerative
     diseases of the central nervous system (CNS), and for the treatment of cancer has
25  been accomplished with recombinant adenoviral vectors.
              The selection and optimization of a particular expression vector for
    expressing a specific siRNA in a cell can be accomplished by obtaining the
    nucleic acid sequence of the siRNA, possibly with one or more appropriate
    control regions (e.g., promoter, insertion sequence); preparing a vector construct
30  comprising the vector into which is inserted the nucleic acid sequence encoding
    the siRNA; transfecting or transducing cultured cells in vitro with the vector
    construct; and determining whether the siRNA is present in the cultured cells.
                                               66

 WO 2008/150897                                                          PCT/US2008/065130
               Vectors for cell gene therapy include viruses, such as replication
       deficient viruses (described in detail below). Exemplary viral vectors are
       derived from Harvey Sarcoma virus, ROUS Sarcoma virus, (MPSV), Moloney
       murine leukemia virus and DNA viruses (e.g., adenovirus).
  5            Replication-deficient retroviruses are capable of directing synthesis of all
       virion proteins, but are incapable of making infectious particles. Accordingly,
      these genetically altered retroviral expression vectors have general utility for
      high-efficiency transduction of nucleic acid sequences in cultured cells, and
       specific utility for use in the method of the present invention. Such retroviruses
 10   further have utility for the efficient transduction of nucleic acid sequences into
      cells in vivo. Retroviruses have been used extensively for transferring nucleic
      acid material into cells. Protocols for producing replication-deficient
      retroviruses (including the steps of incorporation of exogenous nucleic acid
      material into a plasmid, transfection of a packaging cell line with plasmid,
 15   production of recombinant retroviruses by the packaging cell line, collection of
      viral particles from tissue culture media, and infection of the target cells with the
      viral particles) are well known in the art.
               An advantage of using retroviruses for gene therapy is that the viruses
      insert the nucleic acid sequence encoding the siRNA into the host cell genome,
20    thereby permitting the nucleic acid sequence encoding the siRNA to be passed
      on to the progeny of the cell when it divides. Promoter sequences in the LTR
     region have can enhance expression of an inserted coding sequence in a variety
     of cell types. Some disadvantages of using a retrovirus expression vector are (1)
     insertional mutagenesis, i.e., the insertion of the nucleic acid sequence encoding
25   the siRNA into an undesirable position in the target cell genome which, for
     example, leads to unregulated cell growth and (2) the need for target cell
     proliferation in order for the nucleic acid sequence encoding the siRNA carried
     by the vector to be integrated into the target genome.
              Another viral candidate useful as an expression vector for transformation
30   of cells is the adenovirus, a double-stranded DNA virus. The adenovirus is
     infective in a wide range of cell types, including, for example, muscle and
     endothelial cells.
                                                67

WO 2008/150897                                                          PCT/US2008/065130
             Adenoviruses (Ad) are double-stranded linear DNA viruses with a 36 kb
     genome. Several features of adenovirus have made them useful as transgene
     delivery vehicles for therapeutic applications, such as facilitating in vivo gene
     delivery. Recombinant adenovirus vectors have been shown to be capable of
 5   efficient in situ gene transfer to parenchymal cells of various organs, including
    the lung, brain, pancreas, gallbladder, and liver. This has allowed the use of
    these vectors in methods for treating inherited genetic diseases, such as cystic
     fibrosis, where vectors may be delivered to a target organ. In addition, the
     ability of the adenovirus vector to accomplish in situ tumor transduction has
10   allowed the development of a variety of anticancer gene therapy methods for
     non-disseminated disease. In these methods, vector containment favors tumor
     cell-specific transduction.
             Like the retrovirus, the adenovirus genome is adaptable for use as an
     expression vector for gene therapy, i.e., by removing the genetic information that
15   controls production of the virus itself. Because the adenovirus functions in an
     extrachromosomal fashion, the recombinant adenovirus does not have the
     theoretical problem of insertional mutagenesis.
              Several approaches traditionally have been used to generate the
     recombinant adenoviruses. One approach involves direct ligation of restriction
20   endonuclease fragments containing a nucleic acid sequence of interest to
     portions of the adenoviral genome. Alternatively, the nucleic acid sequence of
     interest may be inserted into a defective adenovirus by homologous
     recombination results. The desired recombinants are identified by screening
     individual plaques generated in a lawn of complementation cells.
25           Most adenovirus vectors are based on the adenovirus type 5 (Ad5)
     backbone in which an expression cassette containing the nucleic acid sequence
     of interest has been introduced in place of the early region 1 (El) or early region
     3 (E3). Viruses in which El has been deleted are defective for replication and
     are propagated in human complementation cells (e.g., 293 or 911 cells), which
30   supply the missing gene El and pIX in trans.
             In one embodiment of the present invention, one will desire to generate
     siRNA in a brain cell or brain tissue. A suitable vector for this application is an
                                               68

WO 2008/150897                                                        PCT/US2008/065130
      FIV vector or an AAV vector. For example, one may use AAV5. Also, one may
      apply poliovirus or HSV vectors.
              Application of siRNA is generally accomplished by transfection of
      synthetic siRNAs, in vitro synthesized RNAs, or plasmids expressing shRNAs or
  5  miRNAs. More recently, viruses have been employed for in vitro studies and to
      generate transgenic mouse knock-downs of targeted genes. Recombinant
     adenovirus, adeno-associated virus (AAV) and feline immunodeficiency virus
      (FIV) can be used to deliver genes in vitro and in vivo. Each has its own
     advantages and disadvantages. Adenoviruses are double stranded DNA viruses
 10  with large genomes (36 kb) and have been engineered by my laboratory and
     others to accommodate expression cassettes in distinct regions.
              Adeno-associated viruses have encapsidated genomes, similar to Ad, but
     are smaller in size and packaging capacity (~30 nm vs. ~100 nm; packaging limit
     of-4.5 kb). AAV contain single stranded DNA genomes of the + or the - strand.
 15  Eight serotypes of AAV (1-8) have been studied extensively, three of which
     have been evaluated in the brain. An important consideration for the present
     application is that AAV5 transduces striatal and cortical neurons, and is not
     associated with any known pathologies.
             Adeno associated virus (AAV) is a small nonpathogenic virus of the
20   parvoviridae family. AAV is distinct from the other members of this family by
     its dependence upon a helper virus for replication. In the absence of a helper
     virus, AAV may integrate in a locus specific manner into the q arm of
     chromosome 19. The approximately 5 kb genome of AAV consists of one
     segment of single stranded DNA of either plus or minus polarity. The ends of
25  the genome are short inverted terminal repeats which can fold into hairpin
     structures and serve as the origin of viral DNA replication. Physically, the
    parvovirus virion is non-enveloped and its icosohedral capsid is approximately
    20 nm in diameter.
             Further provided by this invention are chimeric viruses where AAV can
30  be combined with herpes virus, herpes virus amplicons, baculovirus or other
    viruses to achieve a desired tropism associated with another virus. For example,
    the AAV4 ITRs could be inserted in the herpes virus and cells could be infected.
    Post-infection, the ITRs of AAV4 could be acted on by AAV4 rep provided in
                                              69

WO 2008/150897                                                          PCT/US2008/065130
    the system or in a separate vehicle to rescue AAV4 from the genome. Therefore,
    the cellular tropism of the herpes simplex virus can be combined with AAV4 rep
    mediated targeted integration. Other viruses that could be utilized to construct
    chimeric viruses include lentivirus, retrovirus, pseudotyped retroviral vectors,
 5  and adenoviral vectors.
             Also provided by this invention are variant AAV vectors. For example,
    the sequence of a native AAV, such as AAV5, can be modified at individual
    nucleotides. The present invention includes native and mutant AAV vectors.
    The present invention further includes all AAV serotypes.
10           FIV is an enveloped virus with a strong safety profile in humans;
    individuals bitten or scratched by FIV-infected cats do not seroconvert and have
    not been reported to show any signs of disease. Like AAV, FIV provides lasting
    transgene expression in mouse and nonhuman primate neurons, and transduction
    can be directed to different cell types by pseudotyping, the process of
15  exchanging the virus's native envelope for an envelope from another virus.
             Thus, as will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art, a variety of
     suitable viral expression vectors are available for transferring exogenous nucleic
     acid material into cells. The selection of an appropriate expression vector to
     express a therapeutic agent for a particular condition amenable to gene silencing
20  therapy and the optimization of the conditions for insertion of the selected
     expression vector into the cell, are within the scope of one of ordinary skill in the
    art without the need for undue experimentation.
             In another embodiment, the expression vector is in the form of a plasmid,
    which is transferred into the target cells by one of a variety of methods: physical
25   (e.g., microinjection, electroporation, scrape loading, microparticle
    bombardment) or by cellular uptake as a chemical complex (e.g., calcium or
     strontium co-precipitation, complexation with lipid, complexation with ligand).
     Several commercial products are available for cationic liposome complexation
    including LipofectinTM (Gibco-BRL, Gaithersburg, Md.) and TransfectamTM
30  (Promega@, Madison, Wis.). However, the efficiency of transfection by these
    methods is highly dependent on the nature of the target cell and accordingly, the
    conditions for optimal transfection of nucleic acids into cells using the herein

    mentioned procedures must be optimized. Such optimization is within the scope
    of one of ordinary skill in the art without the need for undue experimentation.
             V.      Diseases and Conditions Amendable to the Methods of the
 5                   Invention
             In the certain embodiments of the present invention, a mammalian
    recipient to an expression cassette of the invention has a condition that is
    amenable to gene silencing therapy. As used herein, "gene silencing therapy"
    refers to administration to the recipient exogenous nucleic acid material
10  encoding a therapeutic siRNA and subsequent expression of the administered
    nucleic acid material in situ. Thus, the phrase "condition amenable to siRNA
    therapy" embraces conditions such as genetic diseases (i.e., a disease condition
    that is attributable to one or more gene defects), acquired pathologies (i.e., a
    pathological condition that is not attributable to an inborn defect), cancers,
15  neurodegenerative diseases, e.g., trinucleotide repeat disorders, and prophylactic
    processes (i.e., prevention of a disease or of an undesired medical condition). A
    gene "associated with a condition" is a gene that is either the cause, or is part of
    the cause, of the condition to be treated. Examples of such genes include genes
    associated with a neurodegenerative disease (e.g., a trinucleotide-repeat disease
20  such as a disease associated with polyglutamine repeats, Huntington's disease,
    and several spinocerebellar ataxias), and genes encoding ligands for chemokines
    involved in the migration of a cancer cells, or chemokine receptor. Also siRNA
    expressed from viral vectors may be used for in vivo antiviral therapy using the
    vector systems described.
25           Accordingly, as used herein, the term "therapeutic siRNA" refers to any
     siRNA that has a beneficial effect on the recipient. Thus, "therapeutic siRNA"
    embraces both therapeutic and prophylactic siRNA.
             Differences between alleles that are amenable to targeting by siRNA
    include disease-causing mutations as well as polymorphisms that are not
30  themselves mutations, but may be linked to a mutation or associated with a
    predisposition to a disease state. An example of a targetable polymorphism that
    is not itself a mutation is the polymorphism in exon 58 associated with
    Huntington's disease.

WO 2008/150897                                                         PCT/US2008/065130
              Single nucleotide polymorphisms comprise most of the genetic diversity
     between humans. The major risk factor for developing Alzheimer's disease is
     the presence of a particular polymorphism in the apolipoprotein E gene.
              Single nucleotide polymorphisms comprise most of the genetic diversity
 5   between humans, and that many disease genes, including the HD gene in
     Huntington's disease, contain numerous single nucleotide or multiple nucleotide
     polymorphisms that could be separately targeted in one allele vs. the other. The
     major risk factor for developing Alzheimer's disease is the presence of a
     particular polymorphism in the apolipoprotein E gene.
10            A.      Gene defects
              A number of diseases caused by gene defects have been identified. For
     example, this strategy can be applied to a major class of disabling neurological
     disorders. For example this strategy can be applied to the polyglutamine
     diseases, as is demonstrated by the reduction of polyglutamine aggregation in
15   cells following application of the strategy. The neurodegenerative disease may
     be a trinucleotide-repeat disease, such as a disease associated with polyglutamine
     repeats, including Huntington's disease, and several spinocerebellar ataxias.
     Additionally, this strategy can be applied to a non-degenerative neurological
     disorder, such as DYTI dystonia.
20            B.      Acquired pathologies
             As used herein, "acquired pathology" refers to a disease or syndrome
     manifested by an abnormal physiological, biochemical, cellular, structural, or
     molecular biological state. For example, the disease could be a viral disease,
     such as hepatitis or AIDS.
25            C.      Cancers
              The condition amenable to gene silencing therapy alternatively can be a
     genetic disorder or an acquired pathology that is manifested by abnormal cell
     proliferation, e.g., cancer. According to this embodiment, the instant invention
     is useful for silencing a gene involved in neoplastic activity. The present
30   invention can also be used to inhibit overexpression of one or several genes. The
     present invention can be used to treat neuroblastoma, medulloblastoma, or
     glioblastoma.

             V1I.    Dosages, Formulations and Routes of Administration of the
                     Agents of the Invention
              The agents of the invention are preferably administered so as to result in
     a reduction in at least one symptom associated with a disease. The amount
 5   administered will vary depending on various factors including, but not limited
     to, the composition chosen, the particular disease, the weight, the physical
     condition, and the age of the mammal, and whether prevention or treatment is to
     be achieved. Such factors can be readily determined by the clinician employing
     animal models or other test systems, which are well known to the art.
10           Administration of siRNA may be accomplished through the
     administration of the nucleic acid molecule encoding the siRNA.
     Pharmaceutical formulations, dosages and routes of administration for nucleic
     acids are generally known.
              The present invention envisions treating a disease, for example, a
15   neurodegenerative disease, in a mammal by the administration of an agent, e.g.,
     a nucleic acid composition, an expression vector, or a viral particle of the
     invention. Administration of the therapeutic agents in accordance with the
     present invention may be continuous or intermittent, depending, for example,
     upon the recipient's physiological condition, whether the purpose of the
20   administration is therapeutic or prophylactic, and other factors known to skilled
     practitioners. The administration of the agents of the invention may be
     essentially continuous over a preselected period of time or may be in a series of
     spaced doses. Both local and systemic administration is contemplated.
              One or more suitable unit dosage forms having the therapeutic agent(s) of
25   the invention, which, as discussed below, may optionally be formulated for
     sustained release (for example using microencapsulation, see WO 94/07529, and
     U.S. Patent No. 4,962,091 the disclosures of which are incorporated by reference
     herein), can be administered by a variety of routes including parenteral,
     including by intravenous and intramuscular routes, as well as by direct injection
30   into the diseased tissue. For example, the therapeutic agent may be directly
     injected into the brain. Alternatively the therapeutic agent may be introduced
     intrathecally for brain and spinal cord conditions. In another example, the
     therapeutic agent may be introduced intramuscularly for viruses that traffic back
                                               73

WO 2008/150897                                                            PCT/US2008/065130
      to affected neurons from muscle, such as AAV, lentivirus and adenovirus. The
      formulations may, where appropriate, be conveniently presented in discrete unit
      dosage forms and may be prepared by any of the methods well known to
     pharmacy. Such methods may include the step of bringing into association the
 5   therapeutic agent with liquid carriers, solid matrices, semi-solid carriers, finely
      divided solid carriers or combinations thereof, and then, if necessary, introducing
      or shaping the product into the desired delivery system.
               When the therapeutic agents of the invention are prepared for
      administration, they are preferably combined with a pharmaceutically acceptable
10    carrier, diluent or excipient to form a pharmaceutical formulation, or unit dosage
      form. The total active ingredients in such formulations include from 0.1 to
      99.9% by weight of the formulation. A "pharmaceutically acceptable" is a
      carrier, diluent, excipient, and/or salt that is compatible with the other
      ingredients of the formulation, and not deleterious to the recipient thereof. The
15    active ingredient for administration may be present as a powder or as granules,
      as a solution, a suspension or an emulsion.
               Pharmaceutical formulations containing the therapeutic agents of the
     invention can be prepared by procedures known in the art using well known and
     readily available ingredients. The therapeutic agents of the invention can also be
20   formulated as solutions appropriate for parenteral administration, for instance by
     intramuscular, subcutaneous or intravenous routes.
               The pharmaceutical formulations of the therapeutic agents of the
     invention can also take the form of an aqueous or anhydrous solution or
     dispersion, or alternatively the form of an emulsion or suspension.
25             Thus, the therapeutic agent may be formulated for parenteral
     administration (e.g., by injection, for example, bolus injection or continuous
     infusion) and may be presented in unit dose form in ampules, pre-filled syringes,
     small volume infusion containers or in multi-dose containers with an added
     preservative. The active ingredients may take such forms as suspensions,
30   solutions, or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles, and may contain formulatory
     agents such as suspending, stabilizing and/or dispersing agents. Alternatively,
     the active ingredients may be in powder form, obtained by aseptic isolation of
                                                 74

     vehicle, e.g., sterile, pyrogen-free water, before use.
              It will be appreciated that the unit content of active ingredient or
     ingredients contained in an individual aerosol dose of each dosage form need not
 5   in itself constitute an effective amount for treating the particular indication or
     disease since the necessary effective amount can be reached by administration of
     a plurality of dosage units. Moreover, the effective amount may be achieved
     using less than the dose in the dosage form, either individually, or in a series of
     administrations.
10            The pharmaceutical formulations of the present invention may include, as
     optional ingredients, pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, diluents, solubilizing
     or emulsifying agents, and salts of the type that are well-known in the art.
     Specific non-limiting examples of the carriers and/or diluents that are useful in
     the pharmaceutical formulations of the present invention include water and
15   physiologically acceptable buffered saline solutions such as phosphate buffered
     saline solutions pH 7.0-8.0. saline solutions and water.
              The invention will now be illustrated by the following non-limiting
     Examples.
20                                          Example 1
              RNAi Silencing
              The present inventors modified human mir-30 to contain sequences
     specific for genes of interest (Fig. 1). Stem base and loop sequences were
     conserved.
25            The inventors were able to silence a target gene with miRNA shuttles.
     The target gene (in this case Ataxin-1, also called SCA1) was cloned and the
     SCAl miRNA was also generated, as indicated in Fig. 2. Fluorescence
     microscopy and western blot analyses was performed and the results indicated
     dose-dependent silencing of ataxin-1 48 hours after co-transfection of HEK293
30   cells with RNAi:Target plasmids.
              Next, a comparison study was designed to compare silencing efficiencies
     of various RNAi vectors and to assess strand incorporation into RISC using a
                                                75

WO 2008/150897                                                         PCT/US2008/065130
     highly sensitive, artificial reporter system. The inventors wanted to learn which
     vector is most optimal, and if the results would remain consistent independent of
     target. Since both siRNA strands have the potential to enter the RISC complex,
     artificial RNAi target constructs were generated in both directions (Fig. 3).
 5   Guide antisense-strands target sense targets (e.g., SCAl-Sense), while siRNA
     sense-strands target anti-sense targets (e.g., SCAl-Antisense).
              First, miRNA molecules were compared to " 1 st generation" shRNA
     molecules (Fig. 4).   1s'generation   shRNAs preferentially loaded the unintended
     strand. Also, these shRNAs lack 2-nt 3' overhangs that are optimal substrates for
10   RNAi pathway machinery.
              To fairly compare RNAi strategies, optimized shRNAs ("2       generation"
     shRNA molecules) were designed to mimic pre-miRNAs (i.e., Drosha-cleaved),
     which are indicated as arrows in Fig. 5. Corresponding miRNAs were generated
     to account for the G (U6+1) and UU (polIlI terminator) involved in shRNA
15   transcription. Using the 2 "dgeneration shRNA molecules, RNAi against HD and
     SCA1 showed similar results (northern blot and siChk2 targeting) as the eGFP
     RNAi constructs (Figs. 6 and 7). The compilation of Dual-Glo@ luciferase
     assay results from 10 RNAi comparison experiments (4 eGFP, 4 SCA1 and 2
     HD) using the artificial siChk2 targets were compared relative to mock RNAi
20   (Fig. 8). This trend in silencing efficacy was also observed when targeting
     natural eGFP and endogenous SCA1 or HD (data not shown).
              Simulated Safety of RNAi Vectors
              The inventors also investigated how extensively the RNAi expression
     approaches disrupt endogenous miRNA processing and function. The inventors
25   designed an in vitro simulated RNAi safety experiment. 293 cells were
     transfected with U6.miGFP and siChk2-eGFP Target (1:1). Non-specific RNAi
     "spikes"(U6.shSCA1 or U6.miSCA1) were co-transfected to assess their effect
     on miGFP-mediated silencing. In this experiment, an increase in light was
     evidence of toxicity (i.e., RNAi pathway saturation). The results indicated that
30   in safety studies, shRNAs at low doses inhibit the processing of and silencing
     mediated by artificial miRNAs. The results also indicated that miRNAs at high
     doses only cause minimal inhibition. It is important to note that the silencing
     efficacy of shRNA (low dose) and miRNA (high dose) are similar (Fig. 9).
                                                76

WO 2008/150897                                                      PCT/US2008/065130
             The safety of RNAi in C2C12 cells was also examined (Fig. 10). The
     shRNA-treated cells showed decreased cell viability as compared to the miRNA
     treated cells.
             In vivo Safety of RNAi Vectors in Muscle
 5           The inventors co-electroporated miReporter and GFP:U6.RNAi plasmids
     into the tibialis anterior (shRNA:Left or miRNA:Right) (Fig. 11). IVIS imaging
     was used for Firefly or Renilla Luciferase and GFP. The inventors wanted to
     learn if there was disruption of endogenous miRNA function (i.e., more light)
     between the different vectors. The results show that miRNA vectors were safe
10   in vivo (Fig. 12).
             In conclusion, the inventors found that the miRNA approach is more
     effective than 1s' generation shRNA; that Optimized 2 "dgeneration shRNAs
     silence more effectively than miRNAs; that shRNAs inhibit miRNA-mediated
     silencing substantially more than the corresponding miRNA-shuttle vectors; and
15   that miRNA-based strategies provide safer therapeutics.
                                         Example 2
             Silencing of HD in Mouse Striatum
             AAV vectors for RNAi molecules specific for a target were injected into
     mouse striatum. Four months later, GFP-positive striata was harvested, and
20   RNA was isolated. Q-PCR was performed for mouse HD and CD1 lb, as well as
     Northern blots (Fig. 13). High-level expression from shRNA likely explains the
     observed toxicity.
             miRNA molecules were generated following the strategy set forth in
     Figs. 14 and 15.
25                                       Example 3
             An expression cassette (5NheI-3'BglII) containing the CMV promoter,
     multiple cloning site (MCS) and SV40 polyadenylation signal was cloned into
     TOPObluntIl (XbaI-BamHI, Invitrogen TM ) in reverse orientation. A polIl
     expression cassette containing mouse U6 promoter, MCS and PolIll-terminator
30   (6T's) was cloned into TOPObluntlI with the same strategy. miRNA shuttles
     were generated by polymerase extension of overlapping DNA oligonucleotides
                                              77

     (IDT). Polymerase-extended products were digested with XhoI-SpeI and cloned
     in the MCS of the expression vectors XhoI-SpeI (miVI) or XhoI-XbaI (miV2).
     shHD2.1 production.has been previously described. Other shRNAs were cloned
     using a tailed-PCT strategy. PCR products containing U2-shRNA-6T's were
 5   TOPO cloned into the bluntII vector and positive clones were considered to be in
     reverse orientation to maintain consistency with the other expression vectors.
              RNAi luciferase reporter vectors were constructed using psiCheck2
     (Promega@). Tailed-PR was used to amplify a 3' fragment of Renilla luciferase
     containing a single, perfect complementary RNAi Target site (-25bp: 21bp
10   target + 2 nt 5' and 3') downstream of the stop codon. This PCR product was
     digested with AatII-XhoI and cloned into the same sites within psiCheck2. The
     vector sequences are shown in Fig. 16. Figure 19 shows additional miRNA
     sequences that were used to target either HD or SCAl. These are the predicted
     RNA stem loop structures that contain the active RNAi sequences. The active
15   antisense strand of the embedded siRNA sequence is underlined.
              Figure 17 shows the basic miRNA structure of Variant 2. Variant 1 and
     Variant 3 form unique structures which direct less efficient Drosha processing
     than Variant 2. It was unexpected that Variant 2 would be much more efficient
     than Variants 1 and 3, based on the design algorithm.
20            Variants 1 and 3 may provide alternatives to further de-dose RNAi
     strategies. If one desired a high degree of knock-down, then one would use
     Variant 2. If, however, a lesser degree of knock-down was desired, one would
     use Variant 1 or 3. The boxed region shown in Fig. 17 indicates a region that
     affects silencing efficiency, presumably by influencing Drosha cleavage
25   efficiency or accuracy. The region is located in the stem-base 10-12 base pairs
     away from the Drosha cleavage sites. Silencing efficiency was improved when
     this region was made unstable (i.e., no base pairing or bulged loop). Silencing
     efficiency is reduced when this region is made more stable (i.e., base pairing, no
     or small loop). Variants 1 and 3 contain more stable conformations and, hence,
30   are less efficient than Variant 2.
              To improve the RNAi strategy, the inventors investigated the use of
     artificial miRNAs as siRNA shuttles. The inventors modified the human miR-30
     primary transcript by replacing the mature miR-30 region (-20-bp duplex which
                                              78

WO 2008/150897                                                         PCT/US2008/065130
     is excised via sequential Drosha and Dicer processing) with desired siRNA
     sequences (Fig. 18A). The structure of miR-30 has been well-characterized, and
     the major Drosha and Dicer cleavage sites have been experimentally validated.
     The inventors generated artificial miRNAs containing the structural elements
 5   within the stem-base required for effective Drosha processing but otherwise
     devoid of natural miR-30 flanking sequences. With this strategy, the flanking
     sequences (-35-nt upstream and -40-nt downstream) arise from the vector
     sequence within the multiple cloning site (MCS). Although the minimal
     sequence elements necessary for miR-30 processing are known, the effects of
10   flanking sequences, and consequently the transcript structure within the nearby
     stem-loop base, on processing efficiency has not been evaluated. To test this,
     the inventors generated miR-30 shuttle variants predicted to form unique RNA
     structures proximal to the base of an identical miRNA stem-loop (Fig. 18A,B).
     Luciferase reporters containing a siRNA target site (-25-bp) within the 3'UTR,
15   herein referred to as RNAi luciferase reporters (Fig. 18C), were developed to
     assess silencing efficiencies in co-transfection studies. The variant flanking
     sequences influenced silencing efficacy relative to the same miRNA stem-loop
     flanked by natural human miR-30 sequences (Fig. 18D). Notably, one miRNA
     variant (miV2) yielded 20% more gene knockdown than the natural miR-30
20   structure (P < 0.01). This improved silencing was likely the result of improved
     processing, as miV2 generated the most antisense RNA as determined by small
     transcript northern blot. Interestingly, miV2 exhibits a region of single-stranded
     nature (Fig. 18B, shaded region) that may promote binding of the Drosha
     DGCR8 complex, as supported by models for pri-miRNA processing.

                                          Example 4
          Minimizing variables among hairpin-based RNAi vectors reveals the
                                     potency of shRNAs
             RNA interference (RNAi) is an evolutionarily conserved cellular process
30   regulating gene expression and participating in innate defense against
     transposable elements and viral invasion. RNAi mediates sequence-specific
     gene silencing by double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) which may be processed by
     Dicer into functional small RNAs [small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and
                                               79

WO 2008/150897                                                         PCT/US2008/065130
    microRNAs (miRNAs) among others]. Small RNAs associated with the RNA
    induced silencing complex (RISC) or RISC-like complexes mediate post
    transcriptional gene silencing by targeting transcripts for degradation or
    translational repression. Also, small RNAs in RISC-like complexes may direct
 5  heterochromatin formation to mediate transcriptional gene silencing.
              RNAi has been utilized as a tool to query gene function and is being
     developed as a modality for disease therapy. Exogenous RNAi has been
     expressed in cultured cells and organisms as short-hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) or
     artificial miRNAs (Fig. 18A). The basic transcriptional unit of a shRNA is sense
10   and antisense sequences connected by a loop of unpaired nucleotides. shRNAs
     are exported from the nucleus by Exportin-5, and once in the cytoplasm, are
    processed by Dicer to generate functional siRNAs. miRNA stem-loops are
    typically expressed as part of larger primary transcripts (pri-miRNAs). The
     Drosha-DGCR8 complex excises the stem-loops generating intermediates known
15   as pre-miRNAs, which are subsequently exported to the cytoplasm and diced
     into functional small RNAs.
              Previous studies from several laboratories, including that of the
     inventors, demonstrate the utility and efficacy of shRNAs in vitro and in vivo.
     However, the use of artificial miRNAs (pri-miRNA scaffolds shuttling siRNA
20   sequences) as RNAi vectors has become an attractive alternative. Artificial
     miRNAs more naturally resemble endogenous RNAi substrates and are more
     amenable to Pol-II transcription (allowing tissue-specific expression of RNAi)
     and polycistronic strategies (allowing delivery of multiple siRNA sequences). A
     persistent question in the field, however, is which RNAi expression system is
25   most optimal for achieving gene silencing in particular applications.
              Optimization of RNAi strategies remains important due to the potential
     side-effects caused by exogenously delivered RNAi. RNAi vectors may
     compete for endogenous RNAi machinery, stimulate cellular responses to
     dsRNA, or silence unintended target mRNAs due to partial complementarity.
30   These side effects can produce severe cellular toxicity and even result in
     organismal death. Improved RNAi-based gene silencing strategies may allow
     delivery of lower doses, thus reducing the likelihood of RNAi-related side
     effects.

                To date, shRNA- and artificial miRNA-based strategies have been
       compared with conflicting results. In certain comparisons, the shRNAs tested
       had sub-optimal 5' overhangs due to variable arrangements of transcription start
       and stop sequences, some caused inadvertently by the use of restriction enzyme
  5    sites during vector production. This raises concerns since recent reports have
       demonstrated that 2-nt 3' overhangs, often observed in natural pre-miRNAs, are
       optimal substrates for Exportin-5 and Dicer. Furthermore, none of the prior
      hairpin-based comparisons assessed the equivalency of strand-biasing. Strand
      biasing refers to which strand of the siRNA duplex enters the RISC and mediates
 10   gene silencing. In general, the strand with the weakest base-pairing near the 5'
      end will be incorporated into the RISC. Hence, shRNA and artificial miRNA
      comparisons may be confounded if the vectors, following processing, release
      siRNAs which exhibit differential strand-biasing (i.e., one loading the intended
      antisense strand and the other loading the unintended sense strand). Indeed, a
 15   single base-pair shift during RNAi substrate processing may alter which strand
      of the resulting siRNA preferentially enters the RISC, thus highlighting the
      importance of evaluating strand-biasing in RNAi vector comparison studies.
               The present inventors have demonstrated how early-generation shRNAs
     with poor strand-biasing confound the comparison of hairpin-based RNAi
20    approaches. Minimizing the variables for comparison reveals that, for three
     independent target sequences and in different settings (in vitro and in vivo),
      shRNAs are more potent than artificial miRNAs.
               RESULTS
25             Development of an improved miR-30-based siRNA shuttle
               The inventors have previously demonstrated the therapeutic efficacy of
     shRNAs in mouse models of neurodegenerative diseases [Spinocerebellar Ataxia
     Type I (SCAl) and Huntington's disease (HD)] (Xia et al., Nat Med, 10(8), 816
     820 (2004); Harper et al., 2005, PNAS, 102: 5820-5825). To improve the RNAi
30   strategy, the inventors investigated the use of artificial miRNAs as siRNA
     shuttles. The inventors modified the human miR-30 primary transcript by
     replacing the mature miR-30 region (~20-bp duplex which is excised via
     sequential Drosha and Dicer processing) with desired siRNA sequences (Fig.
                                               81

WO 2008/150897                                                         PCT/US2008/065130
     18A). The structure of miR-30 has been well-characterized, and the major
     Drosha and Dicer cleavage sites have been experimentally validated. The
     inventors generated artificial miRNAs containing the structural elements within
     the stem-base required for effective Drosha processing but otherwise devoid of
 5   natural miR-30 flanking sequences. With this strategy, the flanking sequences
     (-35-nt upstream and -40-nt downstream) arise from the vector sequence within
     the multiple cloning site (MCS). Although the minimal sequence elements
     necessary for miR-30 processing are known, the effects of flanking sequences,
     and consequently the transcript structure within the nearby stem-loop base, on
10   processing efficiency has not been evaluated. To test this, the inventors
     generated miR-30 shuttle variants predicted to form unique RNA structures
     proximal to the base of an identical miRNA stem-loop (Fig. 18A,B). Luciferase
     reporters containing a siRNA target site (-25-bp) within the 3'UTR, herein
     referred to as RNAi luciferase reporters (Fig. 18C), were developed to assess
15   silencing efficiencies in co-transfection studies. The variant flanking sequences
     influenced silencing efficacy relative to the same miRNA stem-loop flanked by
     natural human miR-30 sequences (Fig. 18D). Notably, one miRNA variant
     (miV2) yielded 20% more gene knockdown than the natural miR-30 structure (P
     < 0.01). This improved silencing was likely the result of improved processing,
20   as miV2 generated the most antisense RNA as determined by small transcript
     northern blot (Fig. 18E). Interestingly, miV2 exhibits a region of single-stranded
     nature (Fig. 18B, shaded region) that may promote binding of the Drosha
     DGCR8 complex, as supported by models for pri-miRNA processing.
             Strand-biasing confounds hairpin-based comparisons
25           The inventors next developed miR-30 shuttles (miVI and miV2)
     containing siRNA sequences based on HD2.1 [targets the transcript of the
     human Huntington's disease (HD) gene] to compare to the short-hairpin
     shHD2.1 (a shRNA previously tested in therapeutic efficacy studies in a mouse
     model for HD (Harper et al., 2005, PNAS, USA 102: 5820-5825)). The
30   processing of CMV-driven miHD2.1 variants and U6-driven shHD2.1 was
     assessed by small transcript northern blot analysis (Fig. 4A). The miRNA-based
     shuttles yielded more antisense RNA than the shRNA vector which generated an
     abundance of unprocessed precursor stem-loop RNAs. Also, miV2 generated
                                               82

 WO 2008/150897                                                          PCT/US2008/065130
       more antisense RNA than miV 1 as previously observed in Fig. 18E.
       Importantly, the improvement of the artificial miRNAs over the shRNA was not
       the result of promoter discrepancies since the U6-miRNA vectors were even
       more potent than the CMV-miRNA vectors (Fig. 26; P < 0.01).
  5            The silencing efficiencies of CMV-miHD2. 1(V2) and U6-shHD2.1
       against endogenous HD transcripts were assessed by Q-PCR following
      transfection of RNAi expression vectors into human-derived HEK293 cells.
       Consistent with our northern blot results, miHD2.1 demonstrated approximately
       50% improved silencing of endogenous HD mRNA relative to shHD2.1 (Fig.
 10   4B; P < 0.05). These findings support prior data showing that miRNA-based
      strategies are more potent than first-generation shRNAs. However, because
      recent work has shown that strand-biasing affects siRNA-mediated gene
      silencing, the inventors tested whether shHD2.1 and miHD2.1 (both U6-driven)
      preferentially load the intended antisense strand or unintended sense strand. The
 15   inventors designed RNAi luciferase reporters containing either sense or antisense
      target sites to evaluate the silencing activity of each strand. Co-transfection
      studies revealed that shHD2.1 preferentially silenced the unintended target,
     while miHD2.1 favored silencing of the intended strand (Fig. 4C). These data
     are important as they demonstrate that disparate strand-biasing can confound
20   comparisons of shRNA- and miRNA-based approaches.
              shRNA expression and potency is overhang-dependent
              To more fairly compare shRNA- and miRNA-based silencing strategies,
     the inventors designed shRNAs using the predicted structure of Drosha-cleaved
     miR-30 stem-loops as a design guide. These shRNAs were designed to have
25   minimized 3' overhangs (2-4 Us resulting from Pol-III termination) to resemble
     the 2-nt 3' overhangs which result from Drosha cleavage. Overhangs of this
     length provide optimal substrates for Exportin-5 and Dicer. In addition, target
     sequences were selected to account for the +1-G nucleotide of the mouse U6
     promoter and to contain AU-rich 3' ends, both of which promote loading of the
30   antisense strand. While designing shRNAs in this manner is becoming common
     practice, the initial shRNA - miRNA comparison studies tested shRNAs with
     sub-optimal overhangs. Hence, the inventors revisited testing the effects of
     shRNA overhangs (5' and 3') on processing and silencing efficiency. The
                                                83

WO 2008/150897                                                           PCT/US2008/065130
     inventors developed a series of vectors expressing a common shRNA but with
     altered overhang lengths, in certain cases, resembling those (i.e., 5' variants)
     found in previous shRNA and artificial miRNA comparison studies (Fig. 21A).
     Northern blot and densitometry analyses showed that shRNAs with the minimal
 5   3'-U 24 overhangs yield 3- and 4-fold more pre-shRNA (unprocessed) and
     antisense RNA (processed), respectively, than shRNAs with 5'-overhangs (Fig.
     21B). Unexpectedly, shRNA expression levels appear to decrease with
     lengthening 5' or 3' overhangs. The inventors presume that sub-optimal
     overhangs lower shRNA transcript stability, considering that all variants were
10   expressed by the same mouse U6 promoter and only differ by up to 27-nt in
     length.
               In gene silencing studies targeting a co-transfected RNAi luciferase
     reporter, the inventors found that shRNAs with minimal overhangs (3'-U 2 -4 or 3'
     CU 2 .4 ) overhangs were most effective (P < 0.001), while efficiency is
15   compromised upon increasing 5' or 3' overhangs (Fig. 21C). Northern blot
     analyses and gene silencing studies targeting sense or antisense RNAi luciferase
     reporters demonstrated that each shRNA variant favored loading of the intended
     antisense strand (Fig. 21B,C). While shRNAs with longer overhangs
     demonstrate slightly reduced intended:unintended silencing ratios, their
20   decreased silencing efficiencies likely result from reduced transcript stability and
     processing as supported by our northern blot data.
               Minimizing the variables between artificial miRNA and shRNA
     vectors for comparison
               Next, the inventors sought to compare the improved artificial miRNAs
25   (Fig. 18, miV2) and shRNAs (Fig. 22A, 3'U2       4) for processing and silencing
     efficiency. To test for consistency of results independent of target and sequence,
     the inventors designed shRNA- and miRNA-based vectors targeting SCAl, HD,
     and GFP mRNAs - the former two providing constructs to further test in
     therapeutic development. Importantly, and unique from other shRNA and
30   miRNA comparisons (Boden et al., 2004, Nucleic Acids Res 32: 1154-1158;
     Silva et al., 2005, Nat Genet 37: 1281-1288; Li et al., 2007, RNA 13: 1765
      1774), the inventors' artificial miRNAs were adjusted to account for nucleotide
     restrictions associated with Pol-Ill transcription of shRNAs (Fig. 22A,B).
                                                84

WO 2008/150897                                                         PCT/US2008/065130
     Hence, following Drosha-cleavage, the pre-miRNAs would be comparable to the
     shRNAs and subsequent processing of each stem-loop by Dicer would yield
     similar siRNA species. This is an important consideration since a single base
     pair shift may alter the strand-biasing or potency of the resulting siRNA.
 5            To evaluate the processing of the current vectors, the inventors
     performed 3'-RACE to identify the 3' ends of the sense and antisense strands of
     siRNAs generated by corresponding artificial miRNA and shRNA expression
     vectors (Fig. 27). To date, none of the RNAi vector comparison studies have
     performed this important analysis to test the equivalency of processing between
10   the compared vectors. The inventors' 3'-RACE analyses revealed that both
     RNAi vectors generate at least four siRNA species which were common between
     the vectors. These findings are consistent with a previous report which
     demonstrated flexibility (i.e. base-pair shifting) in dsRNA cleavage by Dicer
     (Vermeulen et al., 2005, RNA 11: 674-682). Notably, the most prevalent species
15   generated by the RNAi vectors was shared, representing approximately 50% of
     the 3'-RACE sequences analyzed (n = 10-12 per vector per strand). These
     results support the integrity of comparing artificial miRNAs and shRNAs
     designed with the present strategy.
              Next, the inventors assessed the strand-biasing of these RNAi vectors by
20   targeting sense or antisense RNAi luciferase reporters, since inconsistent strand
     biasing confounded our original comparison (Fig. 4). In all three RNAi vector
     pairs (SCA1, HD, and GFP), a strong preference for silencing the intended
     strand was observed for both artificial miRNAs and shRNAs (Fig. 23). For the
     SCAl and GFP vectors, neither of the RNAi expression strategies silenced the
25   unintended targets, and only minimal activity of the unintended strand was
     observed with the HD RNAi vectors. These results demonstrate that the desired
     strand-biasing is consistent for each RNAi vector-pair, thus maintaining their
     suitability for further comparison studies.
              shRNAs show improved potency relative to artificial miRNAs
30           As an initial comparison of gene silencing efficacy, the RNAi vectors
    and their respective RNAi luciferase reporters were co-transfected into HEK293
    cells. Luciferase assay data from several experiments (n = 4 SCA1, n = 2 HD
    and n = 4 GFP) were compiled, revealing that optimized shRNAs are more
                                              85

WO 2008/150897                                                         PCT/US2008/065130
     potent than artificial miRNAs independent of the RNAi doses tested and target
     sequence [Fig. 24A; P < 0.001 and P < 0.05 for 1:1 and 3:1 (RNAi:Target) doses
     respectively]. Notably, this improved efficacy of the shRNAs was also observed
     per vector-pair in our previous strand-biasing studies (Fig. 23).
 5             Though targeting RNAi luciferase reporters provides a quantitative and
     facile means for assessing gene silencing, the inventors also wanted to evaluate
     the capacities for these RNAi vectors to silence their natural targets. In HEK293
     cells 'transfected with RNAi expression plasmids, silencing trends of shRNA >
     miRNA were also observed when targeting endogenous SCA1 or HD transcripts
10   (Fig. 24B,C; P < 0.05 and P < 0.001 respectively). Furthermore, the shRNA
     targeting GFP demonstrated improved potency over the corresponding artificial
     miRNA following co-transfection of RNAi and GFP expression plasmids into
     HEK293 cells (Fig. 24D; P < 0.01).
               Next, the inventors compared the processing efficiencies of our artificial
15   miRNA and shRNA vector-pairs in vitro following transfection of RNAi
     expression plasmids. Small transcript northern blots demonstrate that, unlike the
     first-generation shRNAs (Fig. 4A), the optimized shRNAs produce at least 4
     fold more antisense RNA as compared to artificial miRNAs independent of
     target (Fig. 24E). This improved yield likely results from higher expression
20   levels since optimized shRNAs still generate high levels of precursor, whereas
     artificial miRNAs show minimal build-up of pri- or pre- transcripts.
               In vivo applications of RNAi are becoming widely used to study gene
     function or develop therapeutics. As such, the inventors compared one of the
     present vector-pairs (shSCAl and miSCAl) for gene silencing in mice. Since
25   these constructs target human SCAl, and not mouse SCA1, the inventors
     measured in vivo silencing of a co-delivered SCA1 RNAi luciferase reporter.
     RNAi and RNAi luciferase reporter plasmids were co-electroporated into the
     tibialisanteriormuscles of mice, and bioluminescence imaging was performed
     to determine in vivo gene silencing at 4 and 8 days post-treatment. At 1:1 and
30    10:1 (RNAi:Target) ratios, shRNAs show improved potency over artificial
     miRNAs (Fig. 25). These results, together with the in vitro data, demonstrate
     that shRNAs can be more potent than miRNAs independent of target and
     experimental setting (in vitro and in vivo).

WO 2008/150897                                                           PCT/US2008/065130
            DISCUSSION
            The inventors have developed a novel miR-30-based siRNA shuttle
    which shows improved potency over the commonly used miR-30 shuttle which
 5  contains natural miR-30 flanking sequences. miRNA-based approaches provide
    an attractive alternative to classic shRNAs; hence, the inventors compared the
    efficiencies of these systems in mediating gene silencing.
             The inventors present data demonstrating that shRNA and artificial
    miRNA comparison analyses must be carefully controlled, as differential strand
10  biasing between the compared vectors may generate misleading results. This
    possibility, in addition to the use of shRNAs with sub-optimal overhangs, may
    explain the discrepancies among previously published hairpin-based
    comparisons studies. The present analyses provide a fair comparison of shRNA
    and miRNA-based vectors, taking into consideration the transcribed product,
15  processing sites, and strand-biasing. When variables between the two systems
    are minimized, shRNAs demonstrate improved silencing efficacy relative to
    their miRNA-based counterparts. The present experiments are unique in that the
    inventors carefully controlled vector design (e.g., maintained stem-length and
    loop structures between compared vectors), assessed the equivalency of siRNAs
20  generated and strand-biasing, and validated the improved potency of shRNAs in
    vivo. Furthermore, the inventors demonstrate that shRNAs yield abundant levels
    of precursor and fully processed antisense RNA relative to artificial miRNAs,
    thus providing mechanistic insight to explain the increased potency.
             General users of RNAi must carefully consider the balance of efficacy
25   and toxicity when selecting the most suitable RNAi expression strategy. The
     improved potency of optimized shRNAs may be offset by toxicity issues; high
     levels of RNAi substrates (processed and unprocessed) generated from shRNA
     expression vectors may saturate cellular RNAi machinery, thus interfering with
     endogenous miRNA biogenesis and function in cell culture and in vivo.
30           The robust expression of optimized shRNAs may be desirable for certain
     applications. For example, toxicity is likely minimized in low-copy applications
     such as the generation of stable cell lines via retroviral vectors, which typically
     transduce at few to one copy per cell. Hence, shRNAs may be better suited than
                                               87

WO 2008/150897                                                          PCT/US2008/065130
    miRNA-based vectors where low-level expression would preclude sufficient
    silencing. Alternatively, shRNAs may be advantageous when silencing highly
    expressed targets which may outcompete low levels of antisense RNA; for
    example, therapeutic targeting of invasive viruses or cancers, where limiting
 5  toxicity may not be the highest priority.
             For some applications, high vector doses must be delivered to achieve
    efficient transduction of a cell population. Hence, shRNA strategies may be
    undesirable if vector copies per cell cannot be readily limited, as often occurs in
    vivo, and minimizing toxicity is of high priority. In addition to saturation-based
10  toxicity, high levels of siRNAs may promote silencing of unintended targets via
    partial complementarity. Hence, utilizing artificial miRNAs, which exhibit
     lower expression, may provide a unique opportunity to limit RNAi substrate
     levels when large vector doses must be administered to achieve efficient cell
    targeting throughout a given tissue. This concept is particularly relevant to the
15   development of therapeutic RNAi, where transduction efficiency and vector
     safety are of the utmost importance.
             Inevitably, the selection of which hairpin-based RNAi expression system
     is most suitable for a given application relies on several factors: project goals,
     delivery options, target expression levels, and desired silencing efficiency. The
20   approach outlined here, where variables of strand-biasing and processing are
     minimized, can help guide researchers in identifying suitable vectors for their
     RNAi-based applications.
             MATERIAL AND METHODS
25           Vector design
             An expression cassette (5'NheI-3'BglII) containing the CMV promoter,
     multiple cloning site (MCS) and SV40 polyadenylation (polyA) signal was
     cloned into TOPO-BluntlI (XbaI-BamHI, InvitrogenTM) in reverse orientation.
     A Pol-Ill expression cassette containing mouse U6 promoter, MCS and Pol-Ill
30   terminator (6T's) was cloned into TOPO-BluntlI with the same strategy.
     Artificial miRNAs were generated by polymerase extension of overlapping DNA
     oligonucleotides (IDT). Polymerase-extended products were digested with
     XhoI-SpeI and cloned into the MCS of the expression vectors XhoI-SpeI (miV1)
                                               88

WO 2008/150897                                                        PCT/US2008/065130
    or XhoI-XbaI (miV2). miV3 resulted from an unexplained cloning error.
    shHD2.1 has been previously described (Harper et al., 2005, PNAS, USA 102:
     5820-5825). Other shRNAs were cloned using a tailed-PCR strategy. PCR
    products containing U6-shRNA-6T's were TOPO cloned into the BluntlI vector
 5  and positive clones were considered to be in reverse orientation to maintain
    consistency with the other expression vectors.
             For in vivo studies, miRNA or shRNA expression cassettes driven by the
    mouse U6 promoter were cloned in the same orientation upstream of a CMV
    hrGFP-SV40polyA expression cassette.
10           RNAi luciferase reporter vectors were constructed using psiCheck2
     (Promega@). Tailed-PCR was used to amplify a 3' fragment of Renilla
     luciferase containing a single, perfect complementary RNAi target site (-25-bp:
     21-bp target +2-nt 5' and 3') downstream of the stop codon. This PCR product
     was digested with AatII-XhoI and cloned into the same sites within psiCheck2.
15            See Fig. 16 and Fig. 28 for detailed information about vector
     construction.
              3'-RACE analyses
              HEK293 cells grown in 6-well plates were transfected (LipofectamineTM
     2000, InvitrogenTM) with RNAi expression plasmids (200 ng or 2 ptg for shRNA
20   and artificial miRNA plasmids respectively). Total RNA was isolated at 48 h
     post-transfection using 1 ml TRIzol* reagent (InvitrogenTM). Subsequently, 250
     ng of total RNA was treated with A-PlusTM Poly(A) polymerase (Epicentre*),
     and then subjected to first-strand cDNA synthesis using an anchored oligo-dT
     primer containing linker sequence (RLM-RACE, Ambion*; TaqMan* reverse
25   transcription reagents, Applied Biosystems). PCR was performed using the
     following primers: 5'-TTAATACGACTCACTATAGGT-3' (SEQ ID NO: 210)
     (linker primer), 5'-ACTTCAACGCTGACCT-3' (SEQ ID NO: 211) (SCA1
     antisense RACE) and 5'-CCAGGTCAGCGTTGA-3'               (SEQ ID NO: 212) (SCA1
     sense RACE). Products were TOPO cloned into the pCR2.1 vector
30   (InvitrogenTM) and sequenced.
              Northern blot analyses
              HEK293 cells grown in 6-well plates were transfected with 1.5 Rg of

    supplemented to low doses to match total DNA load. Firefly and Renilla

              Animal studies were approved by the University of Iowa Animal Care
     and Use Committee. Eight-week old male C57/BL6 mice (Jackson
     Laboratories) were anesthetized with ketamine-xylazine and injected with 30 l
     of 0.4 U/p1 hyaluronidase (Sigma) into the tibialis anterior(TA) muscle. Two
15   hours later, plasmids in 30 g1 saline were injected into the TA muscle of re
     anesthetized mice were. All groups (n = 4 muscles) received 1p g RNAi
     luciferase reporter plasmid along with 10 ptg empty vector or RNAi plasmid
     (high dose) or 9 pg empty vector and 1 [tg RNAi plasmid (low dose). Plasmids
     were prepared using the EndoFree@ Plasmid Maxi Kit (Qiagen@). Plasmid
20   injected muscles were electroporated as previously described (McMahon et al.,
     2001, Gene Ther 8: 1264-1270) applying 175 V/cm in 10 20 ms pulses at 2 Hz
     (ECM 830 electroporator, BTX). At 4 and 8 days post-treatment, mice were
     sedated with isoflurane, and 30 pl of coelenterazine (0.3 mg/ml, Promega@) was
     injected into the TA muscles. Bioluminescence imaging was performed
25   immediately using an IVIS200 imaging system (Xenogen). Light emissions

                                        hairpin RNAs
             RNA interference (RNAi) is an evolutionarily conserved cellular process
     regulating gene expression and participating in innate defense. RNAi directs
 5   sequence-specific gene silencing by double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) that may
     be processed by Dicer into functional small RNAs, such as small interfering
     RNAs (siRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) among others. Small RNAs
     associated with the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) or RISC-like
     complexes mediate post-transcriptional gene silencing by targeting transcripts
10   for degradation or translational repression.
             RNAi has been utilized as a biological tool to study gene function and is
     being developed as a therapeutic strategy to treat several diseases. Exogenous
     RNAi has been expressed in cell cultures and animals as short-hairpin RNAs
     (shRNAs) or artificial miRNAs, such as primary miRNA (pri-miRNAs)
15   transcripts serving as siRNA shuttles. shRNAs are classically transcribed as
     sense and antisense sequences connected by a loop of unpaired nucleotides.
     Following transcription, shRNAs are exported from the nucleus by Exportin-5,
     and processed by Dicer in the cytoplasm to generate functional siRNAs. miRNA
     stem-loops are typically expressed as part of larger pri-miRNA transcripts.
20   These stem-loops are excised by the Drosha-DGCR8 generating intermediates
     known as pre-miRNAs, which are subsequently exported to the cytoplasm and
     diced into functional small RNAs.
             While several studies from independent laboratories have demonstrated
     therapeutic efficacy of shRNAs in mouse models for neurological disease, few
25   studies have rigorously evaluated the safety of RNAi vectors. To date, most
     expression-based RNAi strategies have utilized shRNAs expressed at high levels
     from strong Pol-III promoters. High levels of exogenously supplied RNAi
     substrates may cause cellular toxicity by various means. RNAi substrates may
     compete for endogenous RNAi machinery, thus disrupting natural miRNA
30   biogenesis and function. Alternatively, shRNA expression can stimulate cellular
     responses to dsRNA, which may result in global gene silencing. Finally, toxicity
     may result from an increased likelihood of off-target silencing of unintended
     mRNAs due to partial complementarity with the seed region (positions 2-8,

     These side-effects can produce severe cellular toxicity and even result in
     organismal death.
              The inventors tested corresponding shRNA- and miRNA-based
 5   expression vectors which, upon processing, yield similar siRNA sequences with
     comparable strand-biasing. The inventors evaluated the safety of these vectors
     in vitro and in vivo and present data further supporting that artificial miRNAs
     show improved safety profiles over shRNAs. In addition, the inventors
     demonstrate that artificial miRNAs are effective in silencing a therapeutic target
10   in a mouse model for neurodegenerative disease.
              RESULTS
              Effects of hairpin-based RNAi vectors on miRNA biogenesis and
     function
15            The inventors previously compared the efficacy of shRNAs and artificial
     miRNAs using a fair comparison scheme by minimizing the variables between
     the vectors (Figure 29). They found shRNAs to be more potent; however, they
     noted that shRNAs are expressed at very high levels and yield an abundance of
     unprocessed precursors, whereas, artificial miRNAs are expressed at lower
20   levels and processed efficiently. The inventors hypothesized that shRNAs
     saturate cellular RNAi processing machinery, and thus, are more prone to
     interfere with miRNA biogenesis and function.
              Initially, the relative safety of U6-driven shRNA- and miRNA-based
     RNAi vectors in vitro were tested by competition assay. The effects of these
25   RNAi strategies on the processing and function of exogenously supplied
     artificial miRNAs were tested. This approach was used to simulate the
     processing of endogenous miRNAs while avoiding the possibility of having pre
     processed mature miRNAs, which may be quite stable, present prior to the
     initiation of the experiment. In these studies, plasmids expressing miGFP and a
30   GFP RNAi luciferase reporter, which contains a perfect target site for the GFP
     RNAi sequence, were co-transfected into HEK293 cells to establish baseline
     silencing mediated by a miRNA-based vector. Next, alleviation of silencing
     upon the co-expression of shSCA1 or miSCA1 competitors was evaluated to
                                                 93

WO 2008/150897                                                          PCT/US2008/065130
    measure the potential interference imparted on miGFP activity. The inventors
    found that shSCA1 significantly decreases the function of miGFP (Figure 30A).
    Notably, miSCA1, at a 10-fold higher dose, only slightly hindered miGFP
    activity. Interestingly, at this high dose, miSCA1 demonstrated similar silencing
 5  efficacy as the low dose of shSCA1 when targeting the SCA1 RNAi luciferase
    reporter in parallel experiments (Figure 30B). These results were supported by
    reciprocal experiments where the effect of GFP RNAi competitors (shGFP or
    miGFP) on miSCA1 activity was evaluated in parallel with GFP RNAi efficacy
     studies (Figure 30C,D).
10            To evaluate whether shRNA expression disrupts miRNA biogenesis
     (e.g., by saturating Exportin-5 or Dicer) or function (e.g., by saturating RISC),
    the inventors performed northern blot analysis to assess the processing of miGFP
     in the presence of shSCA1 or miSCA1 competitors. They found that miGFP
     was appropriately processed to the mature form when co-expressed with
15   miSCA1 competitors (Figure 30E, top panel). Conversely, miGFP biogenesis
     was severely disrupted in the presence of shSCA1 expression vectors at low and
     high doses. This interference likely resulted from the robust shSCA1 expression
     which generated abundant precursor and processed forms relative to miSCAl
     (Figure 30E, bottom panels). These data, together with the inventors' gene
20   silencing studies (Figure 30B), suggest that maximal silencing can be achieved
     with miRNA-based approaches without build-up of undesired precursor and
     processed products which disrupt miRNA biogenesis and function.
              The inventors subsequently tested the effects of the shRNA- and
     miRNA-based RNAi strategies on endogenous miRNA biogenesis and function
25   using mouse muscle-derived C2C12 cells, which upon differentiation induce
     expression of miR-1, a muscle-specific miRNA. This induction was evaluated
     by measuring the activity of a luciferase reporter for miR- 1 function in
     undifferentiated and differentiated C2C 12 cells (Figure 3 1A,B). Next, it was
     tested whether shSCA1 or miSCAl expression disrupts the induction of miR-1
30   activity during differentiation. Consistent with our previous data, shSCA1
     almost entirely inhibited miR-1 activation while miSCAl expression had
     negligible effects (Figure 3 1B).

WO 2008/150897                                                       PCT/US2008/065130
             Inhibiting the function of muscle-specific miRNAs in differentiating
     C2C12 cells has been shown to disrupt the elongation process during myotubes
     formation. The inventors, therefore, measured the elongation of differentiated
     C2C12 cells following transfection with shRNA or artificial miRNA expression
 5   plasmids that co-express CMV-driven hrGFP (Figure 31 C). At 72 h post
     treatment and differentiation, immunocytochemistry was performed to label
     myosin heavy-chain (MHC) to identify differentiating myotubes, and the relative
     lengths of MHC+/GFP+ cells were measured (Figure 31D). The inventors found
     that the elongation process was significantly reduced in C2C 12 cells transfected
10   with shSCA1-expressing plasmids, but not those expressing miSCA1 (Figure
     31E, P < 0.01).
             Effects of hairpin-based RNAi vectors on cell viability
             During the C2C12 studies, the inventors observed less overall hrGFP
     positivity in shSCA1-treated cells at 72h post-transfection. The inventors
15   hypothesized that this loss was the result of shRNA-induced toxicity. Thus, the
     survival of RNAi-transfected C2C12 cells was assessed by monitoring the co
     expression of hrGFP by fluorescence microscopy over a time-course (Figure 32).
     At 24h post-transfection, each treatment (No RNAi, miSCA1, or shSCAl)
     showed similar levels of fluorescence. However, at 72h, the inventors noted a
20   clear loss of hrGFP-positive cells in the shSCA1-treated population and no effect
     in either of the other treatment groups. At 72 hours post-treatment, the inventors
     also performed MTS assay to measure cell viability and found that shRNA
     treated cells had approximately 20% reduced viability relative to No RNAi- or
     miRNA-treated cells (Figure 32). Similar toxicity was observed at a 10-fold
25   lower dose of shSCA1 (data not shown). Of note, the observed toxicity is not
     attributable to silencing endogenous mouse SCA1 in the C2C12 cells, as these
     RNAi sequences are specific for human SCAL.
             Safety of hairpin-based RNAi vectors in mouse cerebellum
             Next, the inventors sought to test whether miRNA-based strategies show
30   improved safety over shRNAs in vivo. The inventors focused their efforts on the
     cerebellum. They generated adeno-associated viral vectors (AAV serotype 2/1
     Figure 33A) expressing U6-driven shSCA1 or miSCAL. The AAV vectors also
     contain a hrGFP expression cassette for observing the distribution and types of
                                              95

WO 2008/150897                                                          PCT/US2008/065130
     cells transduced. Wild-type mice were injected with AAV1-hrGFP, AAV1
     shSCA1, or AAV1-miSCA1 into the cerebellum and sacrificed 10 weeks later.
     Immuno-histochemical analyses were performed for calbindin, which labels
     Purkinje cells within the molecular layer of the cerebellum. The inventors found
 5  that shSCAl caused marked neurotoxicity, as evidenced by a clear loss of
    Purkinje cells in transduced (GFP-positive) regions of the cerebellum (Figure
     33B,C). Conversely, AAV1-hrGFP- and AAV1-miSCAl-treated cerebella
     showed preserved integrity of Purkinje cells in transduced and untransduced
    regions (Figure 33B,C and data not shown). These results support that artificial
10  miRNA expression in mouse cerebellum is well-tolerated, particularly when
     compared to the corresponding toxic shRNA.
              Artificial miRNA-mediated silencing of a therapeutic target in
     Purkinje cells
              Previously the inventors found that shRNAs are more potent than
15   artificial miRNAs when targeting co-transfected luciferase reporters or
     endogenous mRNAs in HEK293 cells. However, the present in vitro and in vivo
     safety analyses support the use of artificial miRNAs for developing vector-based
    RNAi therapeutics. As such, the inventors tested whether the potency of an
     artificial miRNA, miSCA1, is sufficient to silence its therapeutic target in a
20  mouse model of spinocerebellar ataxia type I (SCAl) which expresses a mutant
    human ataxin-1 transgene via a Purkinje-cell specific promoter. SCAl is a
    dominantly-inherited neurological disease which causes degeneration primarily
    in cerebellar Purkinje cells. The mutation responsible for the disease produces a
    toxic, polyglutamine-expanded form of ataxin-1, the SCA1 gene product, which
25  localized to the nucleus.
              Here, the inventors tested the capacities of the corresponding shSCA1
    and miSCAl vectors to silence the mutant human ataxin-1 transgene in SCA1
    mice. Mice were injected with AAV1-shSCA1 or AAV1-miSCAl into the
    cerebellum and histological analyses were performed seven weeks later to
30  evaluate viral transduction (hrGFP), Purkinje cell integrity (calbindin) and gene
    silencing (ataxin-1). These analyses demonstrate that treatment with AAV1
    miSCAl effectively silences the SCA1 therapeutic target in Purkinje cells, as
    evidenced by a loss of nuclear ataxin-1 staining in regions positive for both
                                               96

WO 2008/150897                                                         PCT/US2008/065130
    hrGFP and calbindin. Conversely, shSCA1 expression caused neurotoxicity in
     SCAl mice to a similar extent as previously observed in wild-type mice. The
    resulting loss of calbindin-positive Purkinje cells in shSCA1-treated cerebella
    likely explains the absence of ataxin- 1 staining in these regions. These results
 5  demonstrate that artificial miRNAs are capable of silencing a candidate target for
    RNAi therapy in mouse cerebellum and provide additional support for the
    improved safety profile of artificial miRNAs over shRNAs.
             DISCUSSION
10           Here, the inventors demonstrate how the improved potency of shRNAs
    may be offset by toxicity issues. High levels of RNAi substrates produced by
     shRNA-expression vectors saturate cellular RNAi machinery, thus interfering
    with miRNA biogenesis and function in cell culture and in vivo. The present
     findings show that miRNA-based strategies are less prone to interfering with
15  these processes in vitro, suggesting that artificial miRNAs may be less toxic.
     The inventors extend these findings to show that the shRNA-mediated
     interference occurs primarily at the level of miRNA biogenesis, though
     interference with the RISC is also probable. Furthermore, the inventors
     demonstrate that artificial miRNA expression may not disrupt cellular processes
20   (i.e., myotube elongation) regulated by endogenous miRNAs nor cause cell
     death as compared to their corresponding shRNAs.
             In vivo, shRNAs may cause toxicity in mouse striatum independent of
    HDh mRNA silencing. Similar to our work, others have observed acute liver
    toxicity and mortality in mice following systemic shRNA delivery (Grimm et
25  al., 2006, Nature 441, 537-41). Importantly, this toxicity correlated with
     increased mature antisense RNA levels. However, there are important
     differences between our findings. First, Grimm et al. found that lowering the
    vector dose by approximately 10-fold significantly improved the lethal effects of
     some shRNAs on liver function and animal viability. In the present studies,
30  reducing the dose led to lower transduction throughout the striatum, but did not
     abrogate toxicity. Second, the data by Grimm and colleagues show significant
    build-up of shRNA precursors in liver cells. They attributed the liver toxicity, in
    part, to disruption of endogenous miRNA biogenesis caused by shRNA
                                              97

WO 2008/150897                                                           PCT/US2008/065130
    saturation of RNAi nuclear export machinery. In the present work, the inventors
    detected abundant levels of unprocessed shRNAs in vitro, but interestingly, low
    to undetectable levels in vivo. This suggests that nuclear export was likely not
    limiting in the present studies. Alternatively, the striatal toxicity may be caused
 5  by excessive levels of mature antisense RNAs mediating off-target silencing of
    unintended mRNAs with partial complementarity.
              Although understanding the mechanism of shRNA-induced toxicity in
    mouse striatum is important, the inventors focused on pursuing alternative RNAi
     strategies to alleviate the toxicity. They found that moving the HD2.4 and
10  HD2.4mis sequences, both of which caused toxicity in the context shRNAs, into
    a miRNA scaffold significantly reduced neurotoxicity within the striatum with
    no sacrifice in gene silencing efficacy. The inventors correlated this positive
    effect to lower steady-state levels of mature antisense RNAs processed from the
    artificial mi2.4 relative to sh2.4. Whether this disparity in expression levels
15  results from differences in transcription or stability between shRNAs and
     artificial miRNAs remains to be elucidated.
              The improved safety profiles of miRNA-based RNAi strategies are
     exciting, particularly since in vivo gene silencing efficacy was not compromised
    relative to optimized shRNAs. These results support that we have saturated gene
20   silencing on a per cell basis, as more antisense RNA did not increase silencing
     efficacy. Antisense RNA levels on a per cell basis may be further limited by
     adjusting the RNAi expression and viral delivery strategies. Conveniently,
     miRNA-based vectors are more amenable to Pol-II mediated transcription as
     compared to shRNAs, which have limited spacing flexibility for Pol-II based
25   expression. Artificial miRNAs more naturally resemble endogenous RNAi
     substrates and are more amenable to Pol-Il transcription (allowing tissue-specific
     expression of RNAi) and polycistronic strategies (allowing delivery of multiple
     siRNA sequences). This advantage allows for regulated and cell-specific
     expression of inhibitory RNAs. These versatile expression strategies enhance
30  the application of as biological tools and may further limit potential toxicity in
    therapeutic applications. For these reasons, in addition to the present findings,

             MATERIAL AND METHODS
             Vectors
             Plasmids expressing U6-driven artificial miRNAs or shRNA vectors
 5   targeting SCAl have been previously described along with the SCA1 and GFP
     RNAi luciferase reporter plasmids. The miR- 1 Firefly luciferase reporter was
     cloned using a similar strategy. Briefly, a single site with perfect
     complementarity to miR- 1 was inserted into the 3'UTR of Firefly luciferase
     (psiCheckTM2, Promega@) using a tailed-PCR strategy with the following
10   primers: forward - 5'
     AAAATCTAGATACATACTTCTTTACATTCCACCGCTTCGAGCAGACAT
     G-3' (SEQ ID NO:213), reverse - 5'
     AAAAGGATCCTCGAGCGATTTTACCACATTTGT-AGAGG-3' (SEQ ID
     NO:214). This PCR product was digested with XbaI-BamHI and cloned into the
15   same sites within psiCheckTM2. For C2C12 and AAV vector production,
     miRNA or shRNA expression cassettes driven by the mouse U6 promoter were
     cloned into a derivative of the pFBGR plasmid upstream of a CMV-hrGFP
     SV40 polyA expression cassette.
             In vitro luciferase assays
20           HEK293 cells grown in black 96-well plates (Costar 3603; Corning Inc.)
     were co-transfected in triplicate with RNAi-expressing plasmids (10 to 100 ng)
     and RNAi luciferase target plasmids (10 to 20 ng). In dosing studies, empty
     vector was supplemented to low doses to match total DNA load. Firefly and
     Renilla luciferase activities were assessed 24 h post-transfection using the Dual
25   Glo Luciferase Assay System (Promega@) per manufacturer's instructions, using
     50 [1 per substrate. Luminescent readings were acquired with a 96-well plate
     luminometer (Dynex). Results were calculated as the quotient of Renilla/Firefly
     luciferase activities.
             For C2C12 studies, cells grown in 24-well plates coated with poly-l
30   ornithine (0.1 mg/ml, Sigma) were transfected in quadruplicate with 200 ng of
     endotoxin-free RNAi or empty-vector plasmids along with 40 ng of siCheckTM2
     or miR- 1 luciferase reporter (target site in 3'UTR of Firefly luciferase) plasmids.
     Cells were differentiated by serum-starvation at 4 h post-transfection, and Dual
                                               99

WO 2008/150897                                                         PCT/US2008/065130
    Luciferase assays (Promega@) were performed 48 h later with a 96-well plate
     luminometer (Berthold Technologies). Of note, undifferentiated samples were
    harvested at 24 h post-transfection as cells were nearing 100% confluence.
    Results were calculated as the quotient of Firefly/Renilla luciferase activities.
 5           Northern blot analyses
             HEK293 cells grown in 6-well plates were transfected with RNAi
    plasmids (0.2 or 2 pg SCA1 RNAi with 1.5 pg miGFP for competition studies or
     0.2 or 2 jg HD2.4 RNAi). Empty-vector plasmid was supplemented to low
    doses to match total DNA load. Total RNA was isolated at 48 h post
10  transfection using 1 ml TRIzol@ reagent (InvitrogenTM), and 15-20 pg was
    resolved on a 15% acrylamide gel. Small transcript sizes were determined with
    the Decade Ladder (Ambion@). Loading was assessed by ethidium bromide
     stain. RNA was transferred to HybondTM-XL membrane (Amersham) and UV
    crosslinked. Blots were pre-hybridized using UltraHyb@-Oligo (Ambion@) at
15  35*C, probed with y- 32 P-labeled oligonucleotides (Ready-To-Go T4
    polynucleotide kinase; Amersham) at 30-35'C overnight, washed in 2X SSC,
    0.1% SDS at 30-35-C, and exposed to film.
             For in vivo studies, total RNA from striatal tissue punches was harvested
    using 1 ml TRIzol@ reagent (InvitrogenTM). Northern blots were performed as
20  indicated above using 1-3 jg RNA.
             C2C12 elongation analyses
             C2C12 cells grown in 24-well plates coated with poly-l-ornithine (0.1
    mg/ml) were transfected with 200 ng of empty-vector or RNAi plasmids co
    expressing hrGFP and differentiated after 4 h. At 72 h, cells were washed twice
25  with PBS and fixed in 4% formaldehyde for immunocytochemistry (done at
    room temperature). Alternatively, undifferentiated cells were fixed at 24 h post
    transfection. Fixed cells were incubated in blocking buffer (2% bovine albumin,
    2% horse serum, 0.1% NP-40 in PBS) for 30 min. Anti-myosin heavy-chain
    (MHC) primary antibody (1:1000, MF20 from the University of Iowa
30  Hybridoma Facility) was added with fresh blocking buffer and incubated for 2 h.
    Cells were then washed twice with PBS, incubated with an Alexa-568
    conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:5000, InvitrogenTM) for 30 min, and washed again
    with PBS. Fluorescence microscopy images (red-MHC and green-hrGFP) were
                                             100

    captured at I OX magnification using an Olympus IX70 (microscope) and DP70
    (camera) coupled with Olympus DP Controller software. Corresponding images
    were overlayed, and the lengths of GFP+/MHC+ cells were quantified using
    Image J software (NIH).
 5          C2C12 survival studies
            Cells grown in 24-well plates coated with poly-l-ornithine (0.1 mg/ml)
    were transfected in triplicate with 400 ng of endotoxin-free empty-vector or
    RNAi plasmids co-expressing hrGFP and differentiated after 4 h. At 24 h and
    72 h post-transfection, fluorescence microscopy images were captured at 4X
10  magnification using an Olympus IX70 (microscope) and DP70 (camera) coupled
    with Olympus DP Controller software. At 72 h, cells were trypsinized,
    resuspended in 1 ml of growth media, and 100 pl aliquots (in triplicate) were
    analyzed using the CellTiter-96 AQueous MTS assay (Promega@) per
    manufacturer's instructions. Absorbance was measured with a 96-well
15  microplate reader (Molecular Devices) and normalized to cells treated with
    empty-vector.
            Viral vector production and purification
            Recombinant AAV vectors were produced by a standard calcium
    phosphate transfection method in adherent HEK293 cells, using the Ad helper,
20  trans-packaging and AAV vector plasmids as previously described. Vector titers
    were determined by QPCR, using a Prism 7900 sequence detector (Applied
    Biosystems), and were between 3 and 10 X 1012 DNase-resistant particles
     (DRP)/ml (later referred to as viral genomes/ml). Viral infectivity was assessed
    in a TCID50 assay using the HeLa-based B50 cell line. AAV1.mi2.4,
25  AAV1.mi2.4mis, AAV1.sh2.4 and AAV1.GFP were produced by Targeted
     Genetics Incorporated, and AAV1.miSCAl and AAV1.shSCAl were provided
    by the University of Iowa Vector Core facility.
            AAV injections
            All animal protocols were approved by the University of Iowa Animal
30  Care and Use Committee. Eight-week old C57/BL6 mice (Jackson Laboratories)
    were injected with AAV2/l-expressing shRNAs or miRNAs and sacrificed 16
    weeks later. Mice were anesthetized with xylazine (100 mg/kg) and ketamine
     (10 mg/kg), their heads shaved, sterilized with betadine and placed in a Kopf
                                             101

     stereotaxic frame specially adapted for mouse surgery. A midline incision was
     made and unilateral burr holes were created over the right striatum with a high
     speed dental drill. Subsequently, 5tl of either AAV1.sh2.4, AAV1.mi2.4 or
     AAV1.mi2.4mis (4 X 1012 viral genomes/ml) was injected into the right striatum
 5   (coordinates: 0.86 mm rostral to bregma, 1.8 mm lateral to midline, 3.5 mm
     ventral to the skull surface). All injections were performed through a 10 pl
     Hamilton syringe connected to an infusion pump at a rate of 0.2 l/min with a
     33-gauge, blunt tipped needle. The needle was left in situ for an additional 5
     min to allow the injectate to diffuse from the needle tip. The scalp was closed
10   with 5-0 polyvicryl suture. For cerebellar studies in SCA1 mutant mice, 1 ptl of
     either AAV1.shSCA1 or AAVl.miSCA1 (1 X 10 viral genomes/ml) was
     injected into the cerebellum (coordinates: 6.0 mm caudal to bregma, 2.0 mm
     lateral to midline, 1.0 mm ventral to the skull surface) as described above using a
     Hamilton syringe cemented with a glass micropipette tip.
15             Sacrifice
               Mice used in histological analyses were anesthetized with a
     ketamine/xylazine mix and transcardially perfused with 20 ml of 0.9% cold
      saline, followed by 20 ml of 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1M P0 4 buffer. Mice
     were decapitated, the brains removed and post-fixed overnight. Brains were
20    stored in a 30% sucrose solution at 4*C until cut on a sliding knife microtome at
      40-Rm thickness and stored at -20*C in a cryoprotectant solution. Mice used for
      biochemical analysis were perfused with 20 ml of 0.9% cold saline. Brains were
      removed and sectioned into 1 mm thick coronal slices using a brain matrix
      (Roboz). Tissue punches were taken from the striatum using a tissue core
25    (1.4mm in diameter) and triterated in 50 pl of TRIzol (Invitrogen TM ).
               Quantitative real-time PCR (QPCR)
               For in vitro studies, HEK293 cells grown in 24-well plates were
      transfected with 700 ng of HD2.4 RNAi expression plasmids and cells harvested
      48 h later. RNA was isolated from HEK293 cells or striatal tissue punches using
30     1 ml of TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen TM ). Random-primed first-strand cDNA
      synthesis was performed using 500 ng total RNA (TaqMan@ reverse
      transcription reagents; Applied Biosystems) per manufacturer's protocol.
      Assays were performed on a sequence detection system using primers-probe sets
                                                102

WO 2008/150897                                                         PCT/US2008/065130
     specific for human HD and GAPDH or mouse HDh, CD1 lb (Itgam) and p-actin
     (Prism 7900HT and TaqMan@ 2X Universal Master Mix; Applied Biosystems).
     Relative gene expression was determined by using the AACT method,
     normalizing to either GAPDH or p-actin mRNA levels.
 5           Immunohistochemical analyses
             Free-floating, coronal brain sections (40 pm thick) were processed for
     immunohistochemical visualization of striatal neurons (DARPP-32, 1:100, Cell
     Signaling Technology), microglia (Ibal, 1:1000, WAKO), cerebellar Purkinje
     cells (Calbindin, 1:2000, Cell Signaling Technology), or mutant human ataxin-1
10   (1 1NQ). Sections were first incubated in 0.1 M sodium periodate in Tris
     buffered saline (TBS) for 20 min to remove endogenous peroxidase activity and
     then blocked with 5% normal goat serum for 1 h. After blocking, sections were
     incubated with primary antibody for 24 h, washed, and then incubated with
     biotin- or Cy3-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibodies (1:200, Vector
15   Laboratories and Jackson Immunoresearch) for 1 h. Sections were washed again
     and placed in Vectastain ABC-peroxidase reagent (Vector Laboratories) for 1 h.
     Sections were then washed and incubated in a chromagen solution containing
     0.05% 3,3'-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride and 0.005% hydrogen
     peroxidase for up to 5 min. All staining procedures were carried out at room
20   temperature and deletion of the primary antibody served as a control. Sections
     were mounted onto SuperfrostTM Plus slides (Fisher Scientific) and coverslipped
     with Gelmount (Biomeda). Images were captured using an Olympus BX60 light
     microscope and DP70 digital camera, along with Olympus DP Controller
     software.
25           Statistical analyses
             Student's t-Test was used for all studies, unless indicated otherwise. For
     C2C12 elongation analyses, a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was
     performed followed by Bonferroni post-hoc analyses to assess for significant
     differences between individual groups. In all statistical analyses, P < 0.05 was
30   considered significant.
             Vector design
             An expression cassette (5'NheI-3'BglII) containing the CMV promoter,
     multiple cloning site (MCS) and SV40 polyadenylation (polyA) signal was
                                              103

WO 2008/150897                                                        PCT/US2008/065130
    cloned into TOPO-BluntII (XbaI-BamHI, InvitrogenTM) in reverse orientation.
    A Pol-Ill expression cassette containing mouse U6 promoter, MCS and Pol-III
    terminator (6T's) was cloned into TOPO-BluntIl with the same strategy.
    Artificial miRNAs were generated by polymerase extension of overlapping DNA
 5   oligonucleotides (IDT). Polymerase-extended products were digested with
     XhoI-SpeI and cloned into the MCS of the expression vectors XhoI-SpeI (miV1)
     or XhoI-XbaI (miV2). miV3 resulted from an unexplained cloning error. Other
     shRNAs were cloned using a tailed-PCR strategy. PCR products containing U6
     shRNA-6T's were TOPO cloned into the BluntIl vector and positive clones were
10   considered to be in reverse orientation to maintain consistency with the other
     expression vectors.
              For in vivo studies, miRNA or shRNA expression cassettes driven by the
     mouse U6 promoter were cloned in the same orientation upstream of a CMV
     hrGFP-SV40polyA expression cassette.
15            RNAi luciferase reporter vectors were constructed using psiCheck2 TM
     (Promega@). Tailed-PCR was used to amplify a 3' fragment of Renilla
     luciferase containing a single, perfect complementary RNAi target site (~25-bp:
     21-bp target +2-nt 5' and 3') downstream of the stop codon. This PCR product
     was digested with AatII-XhoI and cloned into the same sites within
20   psiCheck   TM 2.
              See Fig. 31 for detailed information about vector construction.
              Northern blot analyses
              HEK293 cells grown in 6-well plates were transfected with 1.5 Rg of
     RNAi expression plasmid. Total RNA was isolated at 48 h post-transfection
25   using 1 ml TRIzol@ reagent (InvitrogenT M ); alternatively, the small RNA
     fraction was harvested using mirVanaTM Isolation Kit (Ambion@). 15-20 pg
     total RNA or 1-2 pg small RNA fraction was resolved on a 15% acrylamide gel.
     Small transcript sizes were determined with the Decade Ladder (Ambion@).
     Consistent loading and RNA integrity was assessed by ethidium bromide stain.
30   RNA was transferred to Hybond-XL membrane (Amersham Pharmacia) at 200
     400 mA for 1-2 h and UV-crosslinked with the auto-crosslink function on a
      Stratalinker 1800 (Stratagene*). Blots were pre-hybridized using UltraHyb
      Oligo (Ambion@) at 35'C, probed with 32 P-labeled oligonucleotides (Ready-To

     Go T4 polynucleotide kinase; Amersham) at 30-35'C overnight, washed three
     times (5 min each) in 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 30-35'C, and exposed to film.
     Alternatively, blots were probed with biotin-labeled oligonucleotides and
     analyzed using the Bio-Detect Kit (Ambion@). Densitometry analyses were
 5   performed using a bioimaging system (UVP) coupled with LabWorks software
     (UVP).
              Quantitative real-time PCR analyses
              HEK293 cells grown in 24-well plates were transfected with 700 ng
     RNAi-expressing plasmids. At 48 h post-transfection, total RNA was isolated
10   with 0.5 ml TRIzol@ reagent (InvitrogenTM), and random-primed first-strand
     cDNA synthesis was performed using 1 gg total RNA (TaqMan@ reverse
     transcription reagents; Applied Biosystems) per manufacturer's protocol.
     Assays were performed on a sequence detection system using primers-probe sets
     specific for human HD, SCAl, GAPDH or 18S rRNA (Prism 7900HT and
15   TaqMan 2X Universal Master Mix; Applied Biosystems). Relative gene
     expression was determined by using the relative standard curve method.
              GFP silencing analyses
              HEK293 cells grown in 12-well plates were transfected with 1.2 pg and
     300 ng of RNAi (SCA1 or GFP) and eGFP expression plasmids respectively. At
20   48 h post-transfection, fluorescent photomicrographs were captured at 4X
     magnification using an Olympus IX70 (microscope) and DP70 (camera) coupled
     with Olympus DP Controller software. Mean fluorescence in each image was
     determined using the histogram function in Image J software (NIH). Results for
     GFP RNAi-treated cells were normalized to control SCA1 RNAi-treated cells.
25            In vitro luciferase assays
              HEK293 cells grown in black 96-well plates (Costar 3603; Corning Inc.)
     were co-transfected in triplicate with RNAi-expressing plasmids (1-60 ng) and
     RNAi luciferase target plasmids (10-20 ng). In dosing studies, empty-vector was
     supplemented to low doses to match total DNA load. Firefly and Renilla
30   luciferase activities were assessed 24 h post-transfection using the Dual-Glo
     Luciferase Assay System (Promega@) per manufacturer's instructions, using 50
     ptl per substrate. Luminescent readings were acquired with a 96-well plate

     luciferase activities.
              In vivo luciferase assays
              Animal studies were approved by the University of Iowa Animal Care
 5   and Use Committee. Eight-week old male C57/BL6 mice (Jackson
     Laboratories) were anesthetized with ketamine-xylazine and injected with 30 pl
     of 0.4 U/g1 hyaluronidase (Sigma) into the tibialisanterior(TA) muscle. Two
     hours later, plasmids in 30 pl saline were injected into the TA muscle of re
     anesthetized mice were. All groups (n = 4 muscles) received lug RNAi
10   luciferase reporter plasmid along with 10 gg empty vector or RNAi plasmid
     (high dose) or 9 Rg empty vector and 1 pg RNAi plasmid (low dose). Plasmids
     were prepared using the EndoFree@ Plasmid Maxi Kit (Qiagen). Plasmid
     injected muscles were electroporated as previously described applying 175 V/cm
     in 10 20 ms pulses at 2 Hz (ECM 830 electroporator, BTX). At 4 and 8 d days
15   post-treatment, mice were sedated with isoflurane, and 30 Pl of coelenterazine
     (0.3 mg/ml, Promega@) was injected into the TA muscles. Bioluminescence
     imaging was performed immediately using an IVIS200 imaging system
     (Xenogen). Light emissions were analyzed using Living Image software
     (Xenogen) and Igor Pro image analysis software (WaveMetrics Inc.). Data
20   collected at 4 and 8 d revealed similar silencing trends (4 d not shown).
              Statistical analyses
               Student's t-Test was used for all studies where P-values are provided. In
     all statistical analyses, P < 0.05 was considered significant.

                 Artificial miRNAs mitigate shRNA-mediated toxicity in the brain:
            implications for the therapeutic development of RNA interference
              The ability of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) to silence target genes
     was first demonstrated in 1998 and has since emerged as a revolutionary strategy
30   to reduce target gene expression. RNAi occurs naturally in cells as a post
     transcriptional regulatory mechanism mediated by endogenous miRNAs. RNAi
     is hypothesized to have evolved as a cellular coping mechanism providing the
     cell a means to decrease the expression of various deleterious viruses and
                                               106

     transposons. In recent years, scientists have co-opted this biological process to
     reduce expression of target mRNAs using exogenously applied siRNAs,
     shRNAs or artificial miRNAs. Aside from the widespread basic biological
     applications of RNAi, the ability to reduce gene expression marks a major
 5   advance towards the development of disease therapies, particularly for
     dominantly inherited disorders.
             Among the dominant diseases that may benefit from RNAi-based
     therapies is Huntington's disease (HD). Partial reduction of mutant huntingtin
     expression by viral delivery of shRNAs is efficacious in preventing the
10   development of motor deficits and neuropathology in transgenic mouse models
     of HD. In proof-of-principal studies, the therapeutic effect on disease phenotype
     was studied by knocking down a mutant human HD transgene in the setting of
     two normal mouse HDh alleles. While allele-specific targeting of disease
     transcripts for HD therapy would be ideal, to date, no prevalent single nucleotide
15   polymorphism (SNP) residing on the mutant transcript has been identified.
     Therefore, the inventors undertook studies to identify inhibitory RNAs that
     would target both mouse HDh and human HD transcripts, with the intention of
     testing the efficacy of reducing expression of both alleles in a knock-in model of
     HD. This example describes the surprising finding of neurotoxicity in mouse
20   brain caused by some, but not all, shRNA expression vectors screened in vivo,
     and the notable reduction in toxicity after moving those toxic inhibitory RNAs
     into miRNA-based delivery systems.
              RESULTS
              shRNAs cause striatal toxicity in mice
25            First shRNAs (driven by the mouse U6 promoter) that target conserved
     sequences spanning human HD and mouse HDh mRNAs were designed and
     screened (Figs. 34 and 35A). Silencing of HD mRNA measured by quantitative
     real-time PCR (QPCR) and dot blot analysis revealed a decrease in huntingtin
     protein expression following transfection of shRNA expression plasmids into
30   mouse C2C12 and human-derived HEK293 cell lines (data not shown). Of the
     35 shRNAs tested, 3 were chosen for further study based on silencing efficacy.
     The shRNAs target sequences in exons 2, 8 and 30 of HD mRNAs, and are
     henceforth referred to as sh2.4, sh8.2 and sh30.1, respectively (Fig. 35B).

     Western blot analysis demonstrated that these shRNAs, but not mismatch (mis)
     control shRNAs, reduce endogenous huntingtin protein expression in mouse
     C2C12 cells (Fig. 35C). Similar results were seen in human-derived HEK 293
     cells.
 5            To examine the long-term effects of brain-delivered shRNAs in the
     CAG140 knock-in mouse model, U6-shRNA expression cassettes were cloned
     into adeno-associated viral vectors (AAV serotype 2/1- Fig. 36A). AAVs also
     contained a humanized Renilla green fluorescence protein (hrGFP) expression
     cassette to identify the distribution and types of cells transduced. Five-week old
10   CAG140 knock-in mice were injected bilaterally into the striatum with
     AAVsh2.4-GFP, AAVsh8.2-GFP, AAVsh30.1-GFP or AAV-GFP (viral control)
     and sacrificed 15 weeks later. Robust expression of GFP was observed in cells
     throughout the rostral/caudal extent of the striatum and within fibers of the
     globus pallidus (Fig. 36B). Immunofluorescence analyses indicated that GFP
15   positive cells co-localized with a neuronal marker (NeuN) but not with markers
     for astrocytes (GFAP) or oligodendrocytes (RIP1) (Fig. 37). QPCR performed
     on RNA isolated from GFP-positive striatal tissue showed a significant and
     statistically similar reduction of HDh mRNA expression (-60%) among the
     different active shRNA-expressing vectors compared to mice injected with
20   AAV-GFP (Fig. 36C, F(3,1 1) = 32.3, P < 0.001 for post-hoc analyses comparing
     each AAV-shRNA group to the AAV-GFP control). Moreover, western blot
     analysis demonstrated a significant reduction in huntingtin protein levels
     following AAVshRNA-GFP administration compared to controls (Fig. 37,
     t(8)=3.9, P<0.01).
25            Unexpectedly, immunohistochemical analyses for dopamine- and cAMP
     regulated protein (DARPP-32), a marker of medium-sized spiny projection
     neurons in the striatum, revealed striatal toxicity in mice injected with
     AAVsh2.4-GFP and AAVsh30.1-GFP (Fig 36D, top panel). Reduction in
     DARPP-32 immunoreactivity was largely confined to the transduced (GFP
30   positive) regions of the striatum. Interestingly, this toxicity was not seen in mice
     injected with AAVsh8.2-GFP (Fig. 36D, top panel); striata from these mice were
     similar to AAV-GFP-injected control mice.
                                               108

WO 2008/150897                                                            PCT/US2008/065130
              To assess whether the observed loss of DARPP-32 staining was
     associated with microglial activation, tissue sections were stained with an anti
     Ibal antibody to identify both resting and reactive microglia throughout the
     brain. AAVsh2.4-GFP and AAVsh30.1-GFP-injected striata demonstrated high
 5   Ibal expression, whereas AAVsh8.2-GFP-injected striata were similar to control
     mice (Fig. 36D, bottom panel). Moreover, AAVsh2.4-GFP- and AAVsh3O.1
     GFP-injected mice demonstrated dramatic reactive astrogliosis compared to
     AAVsh8.2-GFP and control-injected mice, as evidenced by robust GFAP
     staining in areas of the striatum corresponding to high GFP positivity (data not
10   shown). Notably, a mismatch control for the 2.4 sequence, AAVsh2.4mis-GFP,
     induced toxicity similar to sh2.4 and sh30. 1, without reducing HDh mRNA
     expression. This, in addition to the sh8.2 data, indicates that three (two active,
     one inactive) of four shRNAs were toxic and that toxicity is not caused by
     silencing huntingtin.
15            Although all U6-shRNA expression cassettes were cloned into the same
     viral vector, the inventors tested for the possibility that toxicity correlated with
     steady-state levels of the expressed products. RNA samples harvested from
     shRNA-treated striata were analyzed by small transcript northern blot probing
     for the mature antisense (AS) and sense (S) RNAs generated by the respective
20   shRNAs. Results demonstrate that sh2.4 AS RNA and sh30.1AS RNA are
     expressed more robustly than sh8.2 AS RNA (n=2 per group, Fig. 38), thus
     correlating toxicity with increased expression levels of the shRNAs in vivo. The
     disparity in expression levels is interesting, particularly given the fact that each
     shRNA was designed using the same rules, injected at the same viral dose,
25   driven by the same Pol-III promoter and silenced HDh mRNA to a similar
     degree. Notably, the sense strands and pre-processed products for the shRNAs
     were not detectable in brain lysates, suggesting that the toxicity is due, in part, to
     high levels of inhibitory RNAs rather than inappropriate sense strand loading
     into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC).
30            Artificial miRNAs are expressed at lower levels relative to shRNAs
              Because the toxic shRNAs were expressed at higher levels than the non
     toxic, active hairpin, an approach to reduce toxicity would be to lower the viral
     titer injected. In brain, decreasing the titers by a half log (le ) or a full log
                                               109

WO 2008/150897                                                           PCT/US2008/065130
     (5e") achieved silencing of HDh mRNA (47% and 51%, respectively) but did
     not alleviate striatal toxicity (Fig. 39). Decreasing the titers even further (1eII or
     5e10 ) reduced the silencing efficacy to 15% of controls, making it non-viable as a
     therapeutic (Fig. 39). Thus, the inventors tested if levels of inhibitory RNAs
 5   could be minimized without compromising silencing efficacy using an artificial
     miRNA as a siRNA shuttle (versus a shRNA).
              As shown in Example 4 above, artificial miRNAs effectively silence
     target gene expression relative to shRNAs, without generating excessive levels
     of inhibitory RNAs. Consequently, the inventors cloned two of the toxic
10   sequences (HD2.4 and HD2.4mis) into an artificial miRNA scaffold based on
     human miR-30, thus creating mi2.4 and mi2.4mis (Fig. 40A). Expression levels
     of mi2.4 and sh2.4 were first compared by small transcript northern blot analysis
     at 48 h post-transfection of RNAi-expressing plasmids into HEK 293 cells.
     Probing for the HD2.4 antisense strand revealed that mi2.4 produces
15    substantially lower levels of inhibitory RNAs relative to sh2.4. Notably, sh2.4
     generates an abundance of precursor and processed RNAs, even at a 10-fold
     lower dose (Fig 40B). Despite the dramatic difference in expression levels,
     mi2.4 reduced endogenous HD transcripts almost as effectively as sh2.4 (50%
     and 60% silencing, respectively) in HEK 293 cells (Fig. 40C).
20            Artificial miRNAs mitigate striatal toxicity in mice
              Next AAV2/1-expressing mi2.4 or the mi2.4 mismatch control were
     generated (Fig. 36B, 40A) to test whether the development of striatal toxicity
     could be prevented relative to AAVsh2.4-GFP. Because shRNA-induced
     toxicity was not dependant on the disease model, subsequent studies were
25   performed in wild-type mice. Mice were injected into the right striatum with
     AAVsh2.4-GFP, AAVmi2.4-GFP or AAVmi2.4mis-GFP and sacrificed 4
     months post-injection. The time-course, volume and titer were identical to those
     used in our earlier shRNA studies (Fig. 36). QPCR performed on RNA isolated
      from mouse striata showed a statistically significant reduction of HDh mRNA
30    (~70%) following treatment with either sh2.4- or mi2.4-expressing vectors
      compared to uninjected striata or striata treated with mi2.4mis (Fig. 39A, F(2,8)=
      77.6, P < 0.001 for post hoc analyses comparing sh2.4 and mi2.4 versus
     uninjected and mi2.4mis). Importantly, the degree of HDh mRNA silencing
                                                110

WO 2008/150897                                                           PCT/US2008/065130
     between sh2.4 and mi2.4 was similar and not significantly different (P > 0.05).
     Additional QPCR analyses were performed on these samples to measure CDl 1b
     mRNA, a readout for microglial activation, as an initial assessment for toxicity.
     Striata treated with sh2.4 showed nearly a 4-fold increase of CD1 lb mRNA
 5   relative to uninjected striata, while mi2.4- and mi2.4mis-treated striata showed
     only minimal induction (Fig. 5B, F(2,8)= 23.6, P < 0.001 for post-hoc analyses
     comparing sh2.4 to all other groups). To determine if these differences in
     toxicity could be attributed to levels of HD2.4 inhibitory RNAs, the inventors
     performed northern blot analysis on the same RNA samples used for the QPCR
10   analyses. Although silencing efficacies between the sh2.4- and mi2.4-treated
     groups were comparable, northern blot analysis, probing for the HD2.4 antisense
     strand, demonstrated considerably more mature antisense RNAs in sh2.4-treated
     mice relative to mi2.4-treated mice (Fig. 39C). These results corroborate our in
     vitro findings and correlate the improvement in toxicity with reduced levels of
15   HD2.4 antisense RNA.
              The inventors further assessed striatal toxicity by histological analyses.
     Immunolabeling for DARPP-32 expression revealed significant attenuation of
     striatal toxicity in AAVmi2.4-GFP-injected cohorts relative to AAVsh2.4-GFP
     injected mice (Fig. 39D, middle panel). Moreover, the intense microglial
20   activation (Ibal positive cells) seen in AAVsh2.4-GFP-injected mice was
     scarcely present in AAVmi2.4-GFP-injected mice (Fig. 39D, lowerpanel and
     Fig. 41). Of note, mi2.4mis-treated brains also showed no apparent toxicity by
     these analyses, whereas, 2.4mis was toxic when delivered as a shRNA. Thus,
     sequences encoding HD2.4 and HD2.4mis were toxic in the setting of a shRNA
25   in brain, but not in the context of a miRNA scaffold.
              DISCUSSION
              Here, it has been show that some shRNAs cause toxicity in mouse
     striatum independent of HDh mRNA silencing. Similar to the present work,
     Grimm and colleagues observed acute. liver toxicity and mortality in mice
30   following systemic shRNA delivery, which correlated with increased mature
     antisense RNA levels (Grimm et al., 2006, Nature 441, 537-41). However, there
     are important differences between the present findings. First, Grimm et al.
     found that lowering the vector dose by approximately 10-fold significantly
                                               111

WO 2008/150897                                                            PCT/US2008/065130
      improved the lethal effects of some shRNAs on liver function and animal
      viability. In the present studies, reducing the dose led to lower transduction
      throughout the striatum, but did not abrogate toxicity. Second, the data by
      Grimm and colleagues show significant build-up of shRNA precursors in liver
 5    cells. They attributed the liver toxicity, in part, to saturation of endogenous
      RNAi export machinery. In the present work, the inventors detected abundant
      levels of unprocessed shRNAs in vitro, but interestingly, low to undetectable
      levels in vivo. This suggests that export was likely not limiting in the present
      studies. Alternatively, the striatal toxicity may be caused by the build-up of
10    antisense RNAs and subsequent off-target silencing of unintended mRNAs. The
      present data on sh8.2 is also consistent with this; sh8.2 was not toxic when
      delivered at the same dose as sh2.4 and sh30. 1. And though silencing activity
      was similar between the three shRNAs, levels of mature product for sh8.2 was
      significantly lower.
15            The inventors found that moving the HD2.4 and HD2.4mis sequences,
      both of which caused toxicity in the context of a shRNA, into a miRNA scaffold
      significantly reduced neurotoxicity within the striatum with no sacrifice in gene
      silencing efficacy. The inventors correlated this positive effect to lower steady
      state levels of mature antisense RNAs processed from the artificial mi2.4 relative
20    sh2.4. Whether this disparity in expression levels results from differences in
     transcription or stability between shRNAs and artificial miRNAs remains
     unknown. However, the latter provides a more likely explanation since sh2.4
     and mi2.4 are expressed from the same mouse U6 promoter and only differ in
     size by approximately 100 nucleotides.
25            In addition to improved safety profiles, artificial miRNAs are amenable
     to Pol-II mediated transcription. Conversely, shRNAs have limited spacing
     flexibility for expressing shRNAs from Pol II based promoters. This advantage
     of miRNA-based systems allows for regulated and cell-specific expression of
     inhibitory RNAs. These versatile expression strategies advance the application
30   of artificial miRNAs as biological tools and may further limit potential toxicity
     in therapeutic applications.
              In some diseases, it is possible to specifically target disease-linked SNPs
     that exist on the mutant transcript. For HD however, no prevalent SNP has been
                                                112

WO 2008/150897                                                         PCT/US2008/065130
     reported. Because earlier work showed that a minimum of 50% huntingtin
     expression is required to offset the embryonic lethality noted in huntingtin null
     mice, knowing the consequences of reducing huntingtin expression in adult brain
     is important to moving non-allele specific RNAi forward as a HD therapy. The
 5   present data with sh8.2 and mi2.4 are encouraging, and suggests that the
     mammalian brain can tolerate greater than 50% reduction in HD mRNA for 4
     months, the last time point studied. The long-term safety and efficacy of sh8.2 is
     currently being tested in a study including histochemical, biochemical and
     behavioral readouts in CAG140 HD mice.
10            In summary, the present experiments show that reducing HDh mRNA
     levels in adult mammalian brain is tolerated. The inventors also make the
     important observation that the toxicity of shRNAs following their expression in
     brain is alleviated by moving the inhibitory RNA sequences into an artificial
     miRNA scaffold. Thus, miRNA-based approaches are more suitable for
15   achieving RNAi in brain to address basic research questions or develop disease
     therapies.
              MATERIALS AND METHODS
              Expression vectors and AAV
              shRNA expression cassettes were generated by PCR and cloned into
20   pCR-Blunt-II TOPO vectors (Invitrogen TM). Each candidate shRNA expression
     cassette consisted of a mouse U6 promoter, an shRNA that targets huntingtin
     sequences, mismatch control sequences containing four base-pair changes
     relative to the respective huntingtin shRNAs or E. coli p-galactosidase (shLacZ)
     and an RNA polymerase III termination sequence (six thymidine nucleotides).
25   For artificial miRNAs, siRNAs sequences based on HD2.4 or HD2.4mis were
     embedded into an artificial miRNA scaffold comparable to human miR-30, to
     generate mi2.4 and mi2.4mis (general structure shown in Figure 4A). The
     artificial miRNA stem-loops were cloned into a mouse U6 expression vector so
     that greater than 30 nucleotides (5' and 3') flank the stem-loop in the transcribed
30   product.
              AAV shuttle plasmids pAAVsh2.4-GFP, pAAVsh2.4mis-GFP,
     pAAVsh8.2-GFP, pAAVsh30. 1-GFP, pAAVmi2.4-GFP and pAAVmi2.4mis
     GFP contain the respective RNAi expression cassettes driven by the mouse U6

     promoter. The AAV shuttles also contained a humanized Renilla GFP (hrGFP)
     gene under the control of the human cytomegalovirus immediate-early gene
     enhancer/promoter region, a chimeric human p-globin eGFP expression cassette
     followed by the splice donor/human immunoglobulin splice acceptor site, and a
 5   bovine growth hormone poly (A) signal. These transcriptional units are flanked
     at each end by AAV serotype 2 145-bp inverted terminal repeat sequences. The
     trans-packaging plasmids, pBSHSPR2C1, were constructed as follows: genomic
     DNA was extracted from AAVl (American Type Culture Collection) and the
     cap coding sequence was amplified by PCR using Pfx polymerase
10   (InvitrogenTM). The AAV2 cap gene was excised from the AAV2 helper plasmid
     pBSHSPRC2.3 and replaced with the amplified AAV1 cap sequence using a
     Swa I restriction site in the rep/cap intergenic junction and a BsrG I site
     engineered just upstream of the AAV2 poly(A) signal. The resulting trans
     packaging construct, pBSHSPR2C1, contains the AAV2 rep gene under the
15   control of a minimal eukaryotic promoter, and the AAV1 cap ORF positioned
     between the AAV2 rep/cap intergenic junction and the AAV2 poly(A) signal.
     The plasmid pAd Helper 4.1 expresses the E2a, E4-orf6 and VA genes of
     adenovirus type 5 (Ad5) for AAV amplification.
              Recombinant AAV vectors were produced by a standard calcium
20   phosphate transfection method in HEK 293 cells, using the Ad helper, trans
     packaging and AAV shuttle plasmids. Vector titers were determined by real-time
     PCR and were between 5 and 20 X 1012 DNase-resistant particles (DRP)/mL.
     Vector infectivity was assessed in a TCID50 assay using the HeLa-based B50
     cell line.
25            Animals
              All animal protocols were approved by the ACUCA at the University of
     Iowa. CAG 140 heterozygous knock-in mice and wildtype littermates were bred
     and maintained in the animal vivarium at the University of Iowa. Mice were
     genotyped and repeat length identified by separate PCR reactions using primers
30   flanking the CAG repeat. Mice were housed in groups of either two or three per
     cage and in a controlled temperature environment on a 12 hour light/dark cycle.
     Food and water were provided ad libitum.

              AAV injections
              CAG140 knock-in or wildtype mice were injected with AAVshRNAs or
     AAV-miRNAs (at the indicated titer) at 5 wk of age and sacrificed at 4 months
     post-injection. Procedures were as follows: in the initial study, 5 p1l injections of
 5   either AAVsh2.4GFP, AAV30.1sh-GFP, AAVsh8.2-GFP or AAV-GFP were
     made bilaterally into striata (coordinates: 0.86mm rostral to bregma, +1.8 mm
     lateral to midline, 3.5 mm ventral to the skull surface). For the miRNA/shRNA
     comparison study, 5 pl injections of vector were injected unilaterally. Injection
     rates for all studies were 0.2 pl/min. Mice used in histological analyses were
10   anesthetized with a ketamine/xylazine mix and transcardially perfused with 20
     ml of 0.9% cold saline, followed by 20 ml of 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1M P0 4
     buffer. Brains were removed, post-fixed overnight, and 40-pm thick sections
     collected. Mice used for molecular analyses were perfused with 20 ml of 0.9%
     cold saline, brain removed and blocked into 1 mm thick coronal slices. Tissue
15   punches were taken using a tissue corer (1.4 mm in diameter). All tissue
     punches were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80*C until used.
              Molecular studies
              For in vitro shRNA screening, shRNA expression plasmids were
     transfected (Lipofectamine 2000, InvitrogenTM) into human HEK 293 cells or
20   mouse C2C12 cells, which naturally express full-length human or mouse
     huntingtin, respectively. Huntingtin levels were assessed by protein dot blot
     (anti-huntingtin primary antibody MAB2166, 1:5000; Chemicon) or western blot
     (protein loading control, anti-p Catenin, 1:4,000, AbCam). Knock down was
     also assessed by QPCR using a human huntingtin-specific TaqMan@
25   primer/probe set with normalization to a human GAPDH primer/probe set. This
     QPCR strategy was also used to evaluate HD knockdown mediated by sh2.4 and
     mi2.4 in Fig. 40B.
              For in vivo QPCR analyses, tissue was dissected from GFP-positive

                             RNAi-Mediated Silencing of Genes
             The inventors have previously shown that genes can be silenced in an
     allele-specific manner. They have also demonstrated that viral-mediated
     delivery of siRNA can specifically reduce expression of targeted genes in
15   various cell types, both in vitro and in vivo. This strategy was then applied to
     reduce expression of a neurotoxic polyglutamine disease protein. The ability of
     viral vectors to transduce cells efficiently in vivo, coupled with the efficacy of
     virally expressed siRNA shown here, extends the application of siRNA to viral
     based therapies and in vivo targeting experiments that aim to define the function
20   of specific genes.
             Huntington's disease (HD) is one of several dominant neurodegenerative
     diseases that result from a similar toxic gain of function mutation in the disease
     protein: expansion of a polyglutamine (polyQ)-encoding tract. It is well
     established that for HD and other polyglutamine diseases, the length of the
25   expansion correlates inversely with age of disease onset. Animal models for HD
     have provided important clues as to how mutant huntingtin (htt) induces
     pathogenesis. Currently, no neuroprotective treatment exists for HD. RNA
     interference has emerged as a leading candidate approach to reduce expression
     of disease genes by targeting the encoding mRNA for degradation.
30           Although the effect of partial reduction of wildtype htt in adult neurons is
     unknown, it is advantageous to target only mutant htt for degradation, if
     possible. Disease allele-specific RNAi are designed using approaches that led to
     allele specific silencing for other neurogenetic disease models. This allows
                                               117

WO 2008/150897                                                          PCT/US2008/065130
     directed silencing of the mutant, disease-causing expanded allele, leaving the
     normal allele intact.
              Constitutive expression of shRNA can prevent the neuropathological and
     behavioral phenotypes in a mouse model of Spinocerebellar Ataxia type I, a
  5  related polyQ disease. However, the constitutive expression of shRNA may not
     be necessary, particularly for pathologies that take many years to develop but
     may be cleared in a few weeks or months. For this reason, and to reduce long
     term effects that may arise if nonspecific silencing or activation of interferon
     responses is noted, controlled expression may be very important. In order to
 10  regulate RNAi for disease application, doxycycline-responsive vectors have been
     developed for controlled silencing in vitro.
              Most eukaryotes encode a substantial number of small noncoding RNAs
     termed micro RNAs (miRNAs). mir-30 is a 22-nucleotide human miRNA that
     can be naturally processed from a longer transcript bearing the proposed miR-30
15   stem-loop precursor. mir-30 can translationally inhibit an mRNA-bearing
     artificial target sites. The mir-30 precursor stem can be substituted with a
     heterologous stem, which can be processed to yield novel miRNAs and can
     block the expression of endogenous mRNAs.
              Two strategies are possible to target a particular sequence, such as the
20   gene involved in Huntington's Disease (Figs. 42A and 42B). One can develop
     non-allele specific RNAi molecules, and candidates based on 8.2 inhibitory
     RNAs have been developed. Alternatively, one can develop allele-specific
    RNAi molecules. The inventors have worked to develop RNAi molecules that
    target several key single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). These RNAi
25  molecules, however, may be limited to the treatment of specific
    families/patients.
              Another approach, which is the approach used in the present invention,
    the inventors targeted the expansion region. This approach has the advantage of
    being able to treat entire HD populations, and not just those with specific SNPs.
30  These RNAi molecules are different because instead of targeting a SNP for allele
    specificity, these sequences take advantage of structural integrity at the sites
    flanking the expansion region. The siRNA data shows that they are effective.

 10           The inventors generated constructs to assess allele-specific silencing of
     Htt (Figs. 43A and 43B). Two plasmids were generated expressing full-length
     wild type (Fig. 43A, pCMV-FLHtt 18Q-Flag) or mutant huntingtin (Fig. 43B,
     pCMV-FLHtt 83Q-V5). Wild type and mutant full-length huntingtin are
     expressed under the control of the CMV promoter and each cDNA have distinct
 15  epitope tags to differentiate its expression by western blot. To normalize
     transfection efficiencies either renilla (WT htt) or firefly (mutant htt) luciferase
     were included on the same plasmid. This design allowed assessment of allele
     specificity in the same cell after co-transfection.
              Western blot and Q-PCR results indicate that the candidate siRNAs were
20   allele-specific in targeting mutant Htt, but not wild type Htt (Figs. 44A-44C).
     HEK293 cells were co-transfected with plasmids expressing wild type and
     mutant huntingtin and with different siRNA sequence. Total RNA and protein
     lysates were obtained 24 hours after transfection. After screening by Q-PCR and
    western blot, some of the siRNA design sequences were observed to
25  preferentially silence the mutant allele. Fig. 44A shows wild type Htt and Fig.
    44B shows mutant Htt. As seen in Fig. 44C, siRNA sequence number 7 (S7)
    reduced mutant htt by 40% and the wild type huntingtin by 6%.
              The inventors found that formulated LNP siRNAs were distributed
    broadly following intrastriatal infusion, that formulated LNP siRNA reduced Htt
30  in adult mouse brain at biologically relevant dose, and siRNAs targeting
    sequences targeting the expansion provided for allele specific silencing.
             The inventors also found that miRNA shuttles for allele specific silencing
    of htt could effectively be used (Fig. 45). miRNA shuttles based on the siRNA
                                               120

     sequence 7 (S7) were generated. To assess silence specificity, HEK293 cells
     were co-transfected with wild type and mutant huntingtin plasmids and mi7A1,
     mi7A2, mi7B 1, mi7B2 or miGFP as a control. Cells were harvested 24 hours
     after transfection and wild type and mutant Htt silencing was determined by
 5   western blot. Mi7A1 and mi7A2 had the most preferential silencing profile, the
     latter the most beneficial.
              Sequence mi7A1 silences very efficiently either wild type or mutant
     huntingtin. This is possibly due to an excess of mi7A1 production. The
     specificity of silencing of mi7A1 at high and low doses was compared. HEK293
10   cells were transfected with two different amounts of mi7A1 and protein lysates
     were obtained 24 hours after transfection. Silencing of both wild type and
     mutant huntingtin was determined by western blot with specific antibodies
     against the epitope tags (Figs. 46A and 46B). Data shows that preferential
     silencing for the mutant huntingtin is achieved when mi7A 1 is transfected at a
15   low dose. Fig. 46A shows normal Htt, and Fig. 46B shows mutant Htt.
              The inventors also evaluated the strand biasing of miR shuttles (Fig. 47).
     Different mutations were introduced to the 3' end of the sense strand of the mi7
     sequences (mi7A2 and mi7B2) to promote antisense strand loading into the
     RISC. To determine which strand was preferentially loaded several luciferase
20   reporter constructs based on psicheck2 vector were designed. HEK293 cells
     were cotransfected with both mi7 shuttle and a reporter construct for each strand
     and 24 hours later cell extracts were obtained. Sequences 7A1 and 7A2 showed
     exceptional strand biasing.
