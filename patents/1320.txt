[1]        This application is a divisional of Australian Patent Application No. 2015243575,
the entire contents of which are herein incorporated by reference.
Technical Field
[1A]       The present disclosure relates to stem cells which express high levels of
Angeopoetin-1 (Ang1) and methods for their production. Such stem cells may be used in a
range of therapeutic applications, for example, to promote vascularisation and/or
angiogenesis.
Background
[2]        Angiopoietin is part of a family of vascular growth factors that play a role in
embryonic and postnatal angiogenesis. Ang I promotes migration of endothelial and some
non-endothelial cells such as smooth muscle cells. Angl also induces sprouting and
reorganisation of endothelial cells into tubules. Angl exerts potent anti-inflammatory
effects on endothelial cells, suppressing Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF)
induced upregulation of E-selectin, ICAM- I and VCAM-1, and inhibiting leucocyte
adhesion and transmigration in response to VEGF and TNF-u (Kim et al. 200 l a).
[3]        Many studies have shown that overexpression of Angl, or the addition of
supplemental Angl, leads to beneficial effects in relieving ischemia and restoring the
function of several organs, including limbs, brain, articular joints, kidneys and most
significantly, in the heart. Other beneficial effects include reliving thrombosis (Kim et al.
2001b). Accordingly, AngI exhibits a number of key properties that would suggest its
utility as a therapeutic for cardiovascular disease.
[4]        Amongst the cascade of growth factors required for the development of a
functional vascular system, AngI and VEGF fulfil central roles. Accordingly, for
therapeutic vascularization in the treatment of ischemic myocardium the use of Angl in
combination with VEGF is also viewed as a highly promising candidate.
[5]        Previously, the combined administration of Angl and VEGF-A into myocardial
infract or peri-infarct zones in test animals has been shown to increase neovascularization
and reduce myocardial apoptosis, leading to increased cardiomyocyte regeneration at the
injection sites, as well as improved vascular perfusion and cardiac function. Submaximal
doses of Angl and VEGF at a ratio of about 20:1 enhanced these effects and was more
potent than that of either factor alone

                                             2
(Chae et al. 2000). These results show that combined treatment of AngI and VEGF
could be used to produce therapeutic vascularization.
[6]       Recently, stem cell therapy has emerged as one of the potential treatments for
ischemic heart disease (Huang et al. 2011; Lijie et al. 2007).
[7]       The use of stem cells alone to promote angiogeneisis remains limited because
of insufficient expression of angiogenic factors in many types of stem cells. Genetic
modification of stem cells, involving transfection of stem cells with a nucleic acid
molecule encoding Angl, has been employed to address this limitation. The use of
genetically modified stem cells has its drawbacks, however, due to complexities with
the technology and potentially undesirable effects caused by the genetic modification
process.
Summary of the Invention
[8]       The present disclosure is based on the unexpected production of a population
of stem cells that express Angl at high levels without the need for transfection of the
cells with a nucleic acid expressing Angl. In one example, this population of the stem
cells also expresses VEGF at low levels and the ratio of AngI:VEGF produced was
consistent with the ratio shown by Chae et al. (2000) to be particularly effective in
enhancing vascularization.
[9]       Accordingly, the present disclosure provides a composition comprising
genetically unmodified stem cells, wherein said genetically unmodified stem cells
express Angl in an amount of at least 0.1 pg/10 6 cells.
[10]      In another example, the composition comprises stem cells expressing Angl in
an amount of at least 0.5 pg/106 cells. In another example, the stem cells express Angl
in an amount of at least 0.7 pg/106 cells. In another example, the stem cells express
AngI in an amount of at least 1 pg/106 cells.
[11]      In another example, the stem cells express VEGF in an amount less than about
0.05 pg/10 6 cells. In another example, the stem cells express VEGF in an amount less
than about 0.03 pg/10 6 cells. In another example, the stem cells express VEGF in an
amount less than about 0.02 pg/10 6 cells.

                                              3
[12]      In another example, the genetically unmodified stem cells express
Angle :VEGF at a ratio of at least about 2:1. In another example, the genetically
unmodified stem cells express Angl:VEGF at a ratio of at least about 10:1. In another
example, the stem cells express Angl:VEGF at a ratio of at least about 20:1. In another
example, the stem cells express Angl:VEGF at a ratio of at least about 30:1. In another
example, the stem cells express Angl:VEGF at a ratio of at least about 50:1.
[13]      In another example, the stem cells are mesenchymal stem cells. In another
example, the stem cells are mesenchymal precursor cells. In another example, the stem
cells are derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS cells).
[14]      In another example, the composition further comprising an acceptable
pharmaceutical carrier.
[15]      In another example the composition is produced by culturing genetically
unmodified stem cells according to the method described below.
[16]      The present disclosure also provides an in vitro method for inducing AngI
expression in stem cells, the method comprising: culturing a population of stem cells in
a cell culture media, wherein the cell culture media:
    *   contains a short acting L-ascorbic acid derivative but does not contain a
        substantial amount of a long acting L-ascorbic acid derivative; and/or
    *   is supplemented with less than 10% v/v fetal calf serum.
[17]      The present disclosure also provides an in vitro method for inducing AngI
expression in stem cells, the method comprising: culturing a population of stem cells in
a cell culture media, wherein the cell culture media:
    *   contains a short acting L-ascorbic acid derivative but does not contain a
        substantial amount of a long acting L-ascorbic acid derivative; and/or
    *   is supplemented with less than 10% v/v fetal calf serum; and/or
    *   is supplemented with a non-fetal serum.
[18]      In one example, the above method further comprises measuring the Angl
levels to determine that AngI expression is induced. In another example, AngI
expression is induced when the stem cells express Angl in an amount of at least 0.5
pg/10 6 cells. In another example, Angl expression is induced when the stem cells
express AngI in an amount of at least 0.7 pg/10 6 cells. In another example, Angl

                                              4
expression is induced when the stem cells express Angl in an amount of at least 1
pg/10 6 cells.
[19]      In one example, the above method further comprises selecting cells with
induced Angl expression. In one example, cells which express Angl in an amount of
at least 0.5 pg/106 cells are selected. In another example, cells which express Angl in
an amount of at least 0.7 pg/106 cells are selected. In another example, cells which
express Angl in an amount of at least 1 pg/10 6 cells are selected.
[20]      In one example, the method further comprises measuring the Ang 1 levels to
determine that Angl expression is induced and selecting cells with induced Angl
expression.

salt.
[22]      In one example, the short acting ascorbic acid derivative is a L-ascorbic acid
sodium salt.
[23]      In one example, the cell culture media is supplemented with less than 10% v/v
fetal calf serum (FCS).
[24]      In one example, the cell culture media is supplemented with less than 8% v/v
fetal calf serum (FCS).
[25]      In one example, the cell culture media is supplemented with less than 7% v/v
fetal calf serum (FCS).
[26]      In one example, the cell culture media is supplemented with less than 6% v/v
fetal calf serum (FCS).
[27]      In one example, the cell culture media is supplemented with less than 5% v/v
fetal calf serum.
[28]      In one example, the cell culture media is supplemented with one or more
stimulatory factors selected from the group consisting of la,25- dihydroxyvitamin D3
(1,25D), platelet derived growth factor (PDGF), tumor necrosis factor a (TNF- a),
interleukin -1p (IL-1) and stromal derived factor la (SDF-la).
[29]      In one example, the cell culture media is supplemented with a non-fetal serum.
[30]      In one example, the cell culture media is supplemented with mammalian non
fetal serum.

                                            5
[31]     In one example, the cell culture media is supplemented with human non-fetal
serum.
[32]     In one example, the cell culture media is supplemented with neo-natal serum.
[33]     In one, example, the cell culture medium is supplemented with mammalian
neo-natal serum.
[34]     In one example, the cell culture media is supplemented with new born calf
serum (NBCS).
[35]     In one example, the cell culture media is supplemented with human neo-natal
serum.
[36]     In one example, the cell culture media is supplemented with human neo-natal
serum obtained from umbilical cord blood.
[37]     In another example, the cell culture media is supplemented with adult serum.
[38]     In one example, the cell culture media is supplemented with mammalian adult
serum.
[39]     In one example, the cell culture media is supplemented with adult bovine
serum.
[40]     In one example, the cell culture media is supplemented with human adult
serum.
[41]     In one example, the cell culture media is supplemented with human AB serum.
[42]     In another example, the cell culture media is supplemented with at least about
5% v/v NBCS.
[43]     In another example, the cell culture media is supplemented with at least about
2% v/v NBCS.
[44]     In one example, the cell culture media is supplemented with a mixture of
NBCS and FCS. For example, the ratio of NBCS to FCS may be about 1:1.
[45]     In one example, the cell culture media is supplemented with at least about 5%
v/v FCS and at least about 5% v/v NBCS.
[46]     In one example, the cell culture media is not supplemented with fetal serum.
[47]     The present disclosure also provides a method for obtaining genetically
unmodified stem cells suitable for use in promoting vascularisation and/or
angiogenesis, comprising: obtaining at least one cell population including stem cells

                                                 6

[61]      The present disclosure is not to be limited in scope by the specific
embodiments described herein, which are intended for the purpose of exemplification
only. Functionally-equivalent products, compositions and methods are clearly within
the scope of the disclosure, as described herein.
[62]      Any example disclosed herein shall be taken to apply mutatis mutandis to any
other example unless specifically stated otherwise.
[63]      Unless specifically defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used
herein shall be taken to have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of
ordinary skill in the art (e.g., in cell culture, molecular genetics, stem cell
differentiation, immunology, immunohistochemistry, protein chemistry, and
biochemistry).
[64]      Unless otherwise indicated, the stem cells, cell culture, and immunological
techniques utilized in the present disclosure are standard procedures, well known to
those skilled in the art. Such techniques are described and explained throughout the
literature in sources such as, J. Perbal, A Practical Guide to Molecular Cloning, John
Wiley and Sons (1984), J. Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual,
Cold Spring Harbour Laboratory Press (1989), T.A. Brown (editor), Essential

[65]      The term "and/or", e.g., "X and/or Y" shall be understood to mean either "X
and Y" or "X or Y" and shall be taken to provide explicit support for both meanings or
for either meaning.
[66]      As used herein, the term about, unless stated to the contrary, refers to +/- 10%,
more preferably +/- 5%, of the designated value.
[67]      Volume percent (v/v %) defines [(volume of solute)/(volume of solution)] x
100%. Volume percent is relative to the volume of solution. For example, cell culture

                                                9
media supplemented with 5% v/v FCS means there are about 5 ml FCS for every 100
ml of cell culture media.
[68]      Throughout this specification the word "comprise", or variations such as
"comprises" or "comprising", will be understood to imply the inclusion of a stated
element, integer or step, or group of elements, integers or steps, but not the exclusion of
any other element, integer or step, or group of elements, integers or steps.
Stem cells
[69]      As used herein, the term "stem cell" refers to self-renewing cells that are
capable of giving rise to phenotypically and genotypically identical daughters as well
as at least one other final cell type (e.g., terminally differentiated cells). The term
"stem cells" includes totipotential, pluripotential and multipotential cells, as well as
progenitor and/or precursor cells derived from the differentiation thereof. The stem cell
may be an adult or embryonic stem cell.
[70]      As used herein, the term "totipotent cell" or "totipotential cell" refers to a cell
that is able to form a complete embryo (e.g., a blastocyst).
[71]      As used herein, the term "pluripotent cell" or "pluripotential cell" refers to a
cell that has complete differentiation versatility, i.e., the capacity to grow into any of
the mammalian body's approximately 260 cell types. A pluripotent cell can be self
renewing, and can remain dormant or quiescent within a tissue.
[72]      By "multipotential cell" or "multipotent cell" we mean a cell which is capable
of giving rise to any of several mature cell types. As used herein, this phrase
encompasses adult progenitor cells and multipotential progeny of these cells. Unlike a
pluripotent cell, a multipotent cell does not have the capacity to form all of the cell
types.
[73]      As used herein, the term "mesenchymal lineage precursor or stem cell" refers
to cells that can differentiate into a mesenchymal cell type. For example, mesenchymal
lineage precursor cells and mesenchymal precursor cells can differentiate into bone,
cartilage, muscle and fat cells, and fibrous connective tissue.
[74]      In one example the stem cells of the present disclosure are STRO-1+
mesenchymal precursor cells.

                                               10
[75]       STRO-1+ multipotential cells are cells found in bone marrow, blood, dental
pulp, adipose tissue, skin, spleen, pancreas, brain, kidney, liver, heart, retina, brain, hair
follicles, intestine, lung, lymph node, thymus, bone, ligament, tendon, skeletal muscle,
dermis, and periosteum.          Thus, STRO-1+       multipotential cells are capable of
differentiating into a large number of cell types including, but not limited to, adipose,
osseous, cartilaginous, elastic and fibrous connective tissues.        The specific lineage
commitment and differentiation pathway which these cells enter depends upon various
influences from mechanical influences and/or endogenous bioactive factors, such as
growth factors, cytokines, and/or local microenvironmental conditions established by
host tissues. In one embodiment STRO-1+ multipotential cells are non-hematopoietic
progenitor cells which divide to yield daughter cells that are either stem cells or are
precursor cells which in time will irreversibly differentiate to yield a phenotypic cell.
[76]       In one example, STRO-1+ cells are enriched from a sample obtained from a
subject, e.g., a subject to be treated or a related subject or an unrelated subject (whether
of the same species or different).      The terms "enriched", "enrichment" or variations
thereof are used herein to describe a population of cells in which the proportion of one
particular cell type or the proportion of a number of particular cell types is increased
when compared with an untreated population of the cells (e.g., cells in their native
environment). In one example, a population enriched for STRO-1+ cells comprises at
least about 0.1% or 0.5% or 1% or 2% or 5% or 10% or 15% or 20% or 25% or 30% or
50% or 75% or 85 % or 95% or 99% STRO-1+ cells.                    In this regard, the term
"population of cells enriched for STRO-1+ cells" will be taken to provide explicit
support for the term "population of cells comprising X% STRO-1+ cells", wherein X%
is a percentage as recited herein.      The STRO-1+ cells can, in some examples, form
clonogenic colonies, e.g. CFU-F (fibroblasts) or a subset thereof (e.g., 50% or 60% or
70% or 80% or 90% or 95%) can have this activity.
[77]       In one example, the stem cells of the present disclosure are enriched from a
cell preparation comprising STRO-1+ cells in a selectable form. In this regard, the
term "selectable form" will be understood to mean that the cells express a marker (e.g.,
a cell surface marker) permitting selection of the STRO-1+ cells. The marker can be
STRO-1, but need not be. For example, as described and/or exemplified herein, cells

                                             11
(e.g., MPCs) expressing STRO-2 and/or STRO-3 (TNAP) and/or STRO-4 and/or
VCAM-1 and/or CD146 and/or 3G5 also express STRO-1 (and can be STRO-lbright)
Accordingly, an indication that cells are STRO-1+ does not mean that the cells are
selected by STRO-1 expression. In one example, the cells are selected based on at least
STRO-3 expression, e.g., they are STRO-3+ (TNAP+).           In another example, the cells
are selected based on at least STRO-4 expression, e.g., they are STRO-4+.
[78]      Reference to selection of a cell or population thereof does not necessarily
require selection from a specific tissue source. As described herein STRO- 1+ cells can
be selected from or isolated from or enriched from a large variety of sources. That
said, in some examples, these terms provide support for selection from any tissue
comprising STRO-1+ cells (e.g., MPCs) or vascularized tissue or tissue comprising
pericytes (e.g., STRO-1+ pericytes) or any one or more of the tissues recited herein.
[79]      In one example, the stem cells of the present disclosure express one or more
markers individually or collectively selected from the group consisting of STRO-1+,
TNAP+, VCAM-1+, THY-1+, STRO-2+, STRO-4+ (HSP-90), CD45+, CD146+,
3G5+, CC9 or any combination thereof.
[80]      By "individually" is meant that the disclosure encompasses the recited markers
or groups of markers separately, and that, notwithstanding that individual markers or
groups of markers may not be separately listed herein the accompanying claims may
define such marker or groups of markers separately and divisibly from each other.
[81]      By "collectively" is meant that the disclosure encompasses any number or
combination of the recited markers or groups of peptides, and that, notwithstanding that
such numbers or combinations of markers or groups of markers may not be specifically
listed herein the accompanying claims may define such combinations or sub
combinations separately and divisibly from any other combination of markers or groups
of markers.
[82]      In one example, STRO-1+ cells are STRO-lbriht (syn. STRO-1 bri). In one
example, the STRO-lb cells are preferentially enriched relative to STRO-1'd"' or
STRO- lintermediate cells.
[83]      In one example, STRO-lbright cells are additionally one or more of TNAP+,
VCAM-1+, THY-1+, STRO-2+, STRO-4+ (HSP-90) and/or CD146+. For example,

                                               12
the cells are selected for one or more of the foregoing markers and/or shown to express
one or more of the foregoing markers. In this regard, a cell shown to express a marker
need not be specifically tested, rather previously enriched or isolated cells can be tested
and subsequently used, isolated or enriched cells can be reasonably assumed to also
express the same marker.
[84]      In one example, the STRO-1Might are isolated by immunoselection. In one
example, STRO-lbright cells are isolated by immunoselection of cells expressing TNAP.
As used herein the term "TNAP" is intended to encompass all isoforms of tissue non
specific alkaline phosphatase. For example, the term encompasses the liver isoform
(LAP), the bone isoform (BAP) and the kidney isoform (KAP). In one example, the
TNAP is BAP. In one example, TNAP as used herein refers to a molecule which can
bind the STRO-3 antibody produced by the hybridoma cell line deposited with ATCC
on 19 December 2005 under the provisions of the Budapest Treaty under deposit
accession number PTA-7282.
[85]      In one example, the mesenchymal precursor or stem cells are CD29+, CD54+,
CD73+, CD90+, CD102+, CD105+, CD106+, CD166+, MHC1+ mesenchymal stem
cells (e.g. remestemcel-L).
[86]      In one example, mesenchymal precursor cells are perivascular mesenchymal
precursor cells as defined in WO 2004/85630. For example, the mesenchymal
precursor cells express a marker of a perivascular cell, e.g., the cells are STRO-1+ or
STRO-1bflht and/or 3G5+. In one example, the cells are or were previously or are
progeny of cells that were isolated from vascularized tissue or organs or parts thereof.
[87]      A cell that is referred to as being "positive" for a given marker it may express
either a low (lo or dim) or a high (bright, bri) level of that marker depending on the
degree to which the marker is present on the cell surface, where the terms relate to
intensity of fluorescence or other marker used in the sorting process of the cells. The
distinction of lo (or dim or dull) and bri will be understood in the context of the marker
used on a particular cell population being sorted. A cell that is referred to as being
"negative" for a given marker is not necessarily completely absent from that cell. This
term means that the marker is expressed at a relatively very low level by that cell, and

                                               13
that it generates a very low signal when detectably labelled or is undetectable above
background levels, e.g., levels detected using an isotype control antibody.
[88]      The term "bright", when used herein, refers to a marker on a cell surface that
generates a relatively high signal when detectably labelled. Whilst not wishing to be
limited by theory, it is proposed that "bright" cells express more of the target marker
protein (for example the antigen recognized by STRO-1) than other cells in the sample.
For instance, STRO- 1ri cells produce a greater fluorescent signal, when labelled with a
FITC-conjugated STRO-1 antibody as determined by fluorescence activated cell
sorting (FACS) analysis, than non-bright cells (STRO-laulifdti). In one example,
"bright" cells constitute at least about 0.1% of the most brightly labelled bone marrow
mononuclear cells contained in the starting sample. In other examples, "bright" cells
constitute at least about 0.1%, at least about 0.5%, at least about 1%, at least about
1.5%, or at least about 2%, of the most brightly labelled bone marrow mononuclear
cells contained in the starting sample. In an example, STRO- Iright cells have 2 log
magnitude higher expression of STRO-1 surface expression relative to "background",
namely cells that are STRO-1-. By comparison, STRO-1 "' and/or STRO-linterm'iate
cells have less than 2 log magnitude higher expression of STRO- 1 surface expression,
typically about 1 log or less than "background".
[89]      In one example, a significant proportion of the STRO-1+ multipotential cells
are capable of differentiation into at least two different germ lines. Non-limiting
examples of the lineages to which the multipotential cells may be committed include
bone precursor cells; hepatocyte progenitors, which are multipotent for bile duct
epithelial cells and hepatocytes; neural restricted cells, which can generate glial cell
precursors that progress to oligodendrocytes and astrocytes; neuronal precursors that
progress to neurons; precursors for cardiac muscle and cardiomyocytes, glucose
responsive insulin secreting pancreatic beta cell lines. Other lineages include, but are
not limited to, odontoblasts, dentin-producing cells and chondrocytes, and precursor
cells of the following: retinal pigment epithelial cells, fibroblasts, skin cells such as
keratinocytes, dendritic cells, hair follicle cells, renal duct epithelial cells, smooth and
skeletal muscle cells, testicular progenitors, vascular endothelial cells, tendon,
ligament, cartilage, adipocyte, fibroblast, marrow stroma, cardiac muscle, smooth

                                             14
muscle, skeletal muscle, pericyte, vascular, epithelial, glial, neuronal, astrocyte and
oligodendrocyte cells.
[90]      In another example, the STRO-1+ cells are not capable of giving rise, upon
culturing, to hematopoietic cells.
[91]      In one example, the presently described stem cells are mesenchymal stem
cells. The mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) may be a homogeneous composition or may
be a mixed cell population enriched in MSCs. Homogeneous mesenchymal stem cell
compositions may be obtained by culturing adherent marrow or periosteal cells, and the
mesenchymal stem cells may be identified by specific cell surface markers which are
identified with unique monoclonal antibodies. A method for obtaining a cell
population enriched in mesenchymal stem cells is described, for example, in U.S.
Patent No. 5,486,359. Alternative sources for mesenchymal stem cells include, but are
not limited to, blood, skin, cord blood, muscle, fat, bone, and perichondrium.
[92]      Recognition, selection and purification of stem cells carrying the cell surface
markers described above can be effected by a number of different methods. For
example, application of a binding agent to the marker concerned followed by a
separation of those cells that exhibit binding, being either high level binding, or low
level binding or no binding.
[93]      For example binding agents can include antibodies such as monoclonal
antibodies or antibody based molecules.
[94]      Antibodies and other binding molecules can be used in various techniques to
select and purify stem cells expressing the particular cell surface markers.
[95]      Techniques for selection and purification may include, but are not limited to,
magnetic separation, using antibody-coated magnetic beads, affinity chromatography
and "panning" with antibody attached to a solid matrix, fluorescence-activated cell
sorting faces) .
[96]      Stem cells of the present disclosure expressing particular markers may be
selected or purified from a cell population via positive immunoselection. For example,
mesenchymal precursor cells can be isolated and enriched from a cell population based
on the cell surface expression of the STRO- 1 antibody (see for example Gronthos and
Simmons 1995).

                                              15
[97]       Isolated stem cells according to the present disclosure can be expanded in vitro
by culture. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, the stem cells can be
cryopreserved, thawed and subsequently expanded in vitro by culture. In one example,
the stem cells are seeded in growth medium and allowed to adhere to the culture
vessel overnight at 37 0 C, 20% 02. The growth medium is subsequently replaced and
the cells cultured for a further 68 to 72 hours at 37 0 C, 5% 02.
[98]       In an example, isolated stem cells are seeded at 50,000 cells/cm2 in serum
supplemented growth medium and allowed to adhere to the culture vessel overnight
at 37 0 C, 20% 02. The growth medium is subsequently replaced with Chondrogenic
Basal Medium (CBM; Lonza, Walkersville, MD) supplemented with 0.5% bovine
serum albumin (BSA) and the cells cultured for a further 68 to 72 hours at 37 0 C, 5%
02.
[99]       Various other methods of primary stem cell culture are known in the art. For
example, primary stem cell culture can be carried out using the methods described in
Gronthos and Simmons 1995.
[100]      The cultured stem cells are phenotypically different to cells in vivo. They may
express, for example, CD44.
[101]      In one embodiment the cultured stem cells are biologically different to cells in
vivo, having a higher rate of regeneration.
[102]      The cultured stem cells may be cryopreserved prior to administration to a
subject. For example, mesenchymal lineage precursor cells may be cryopreserved prior
to administration to a subject.
Genetically-Unmodified Cells
[103]      As used herein, the term "genetically unmodified" refers to cells that have not
been modified by transfection with a nucleic acid expressing or encoding Angl. For
the avoidance of doubt, in the context of the present disclosure a stem cell transfected
with a nucleic acid encoding Angl would be considered genetically modified. In the
context of the present disclosure the "genetically unmodified" cell naturally expresses
Angle to some extent without transfection with a nucleic acid encoding Angi.
Expression of Angl and/or VEGF

                                             16
[104]     The stem cells of the present disclosure are genetically unmodified and
express AngI in an amount of at least 0.1 pg/10 6 cells. However, in various
embodiments it is envisaged that the stem cells of the present disclosure may express
Angl in an amount of at least 0.2 pg/106 cells, 0.3 pg/106 cells, 0.4 pg/106 cells, 0.5
pg/106 cells, 0.6 pg/106 cells, 0.7 pg/106 cells, 0.8 pg/106 cells, 0.9 pg/106 cells, 1
pg/106 cells, 1.1 pg/106 cells, 1.2 pg/106 cells, 1.3 pg/106 cells, 1.4 pg/106 cells, 1.5
pg/106 cells.
[105]     In another aspect, the genetically unmodified stem cells of the present
disclosure express VEGF in an amount less than about 0.05 pg/106 cells. However, in
various embodiments it is envisaged that the stem cells of the present disclosure may
express VEGF in an amount less than about 0.05 pg/10 6 cells, 0.04 Pg/10 6 cells, 0.03
pg/106 cells, 0.02 pg/106 cells, 0.01 pg/106 cells, 0.009 pg/106 cells, 0.008 Pg/106 cells,
0.007 pg/106 cells, 0.006 pg/10 6 cells, 0.005 pg/106 cells, 0.004 pg/10 6 cells, 0.003
pg/106 cells, 0.002 pg/10 6 cells, 0.001 pg/106 cells.
[106]     The amount of cellular Angl and/or VEGF that is expressed in a composition
or culture of stem cells may be determined by methods known to those skilled in the
art. Such methods include, but are not limited to, quantitative assays such as
quantitative ELISA assays, for example. It is to be understood, however, that the scope
of the present disclosure is not to be limited to any particular method for determining
the amount or level of AngI or VEGF expressed in the stem cells of the present
disclosure.
[107]     In one example the level of Angl or VEGF expressed by a composition or
culture of stem cells is determined by an ELISA assay. In such an assay, a cell lysate
from a culture of stem cells is added to a well of an ELISA plate. The well may be
coated with a primary antibody, either a monoclonal or a polyclonal antibody(ies),
against the Angl or VEGF. The well then is washed, and then contacted with a
secondary antibody, either a monoclonal or a polyclonal antibody(ies) , against the
primary antibody. The secondary antibody is conjugated to an appropriate enzyme,
such as horseradish peroxidase, for example. The well then may be incubated, and then
is washed after the incubation period. The wells then are contacted with an appropriate
substrate for the enzyme conjugated to the secondary antibody, such as one or more

                                              17
chromogens. Chromogens which may be employed include, but are not limited to,
hydrogen peroxide and tetramethylbenzidine. After the substrate(s) is (are) added, the
well is incubated for an appropriate period of time. Upon completion of the incubation,
a "stop" solution is added to the well in order to stop the reaction of the enzyme with
the substrate(s). The optical density (OD) of the sample is then measured. The optical
density of the sample is correlated to the optical densities of samples containing known
amounts of AngI or VEGF in order to determine the amount of Angl or VEGF
expressed by the culture of stem cells being tested.
[108]     In another aspect, the genetically unmodified stem cells of the present
disclosure express Angl:VEGF at a ratio of at least about 2:1. However, in various
embodiments it is envisaged that the stem cells of the present disclosure may express
Angl:VEGF at a ratio of at least about 10:1, 15:1, 20:1, 21:1, 22:1, 23:1, 24:1, 25:1,
26:1, 27:1, 28:1, 29:1, 30:1, 31:1, 32:1, 33:1, 34:1, 35:1, 50:1.
[109]     Methods for determining the Angl:VEGF expression ratio will be apparent to
one of skill in the art. In an example of a method of determining a ratio of Ang 1 and
VEGF expression, Angi and VEGF expression levels are quantitated via quantitative
ELISA as discussed above. In such an example, after quantifying the levels of Angl
and VEGF, a ratio based on the quantitated levels of AngI and VEGF could be
represented as: (level of AngI / level of VEGF) = Angl :VEGF ratio.
Cellular Compositions
[110]     In one example of the present disclosure stem cells are administered in the
form of a composition. In one example, such a composition comprises a
pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and/or excipient.
[111]     The terms "carrier" and "excipient" refer to compositions of matter that are
conventionally used in the art to facilitate the storage, administration, and/or the
biological activity of an active compound (see, e.g., Remington's Pharmaceutical
Sciences, 16th Ed., Mac Publishing Company (1980). A carrier may also reduce any
undesirable side effects of the active compound. A suitable carrier is, for example,
stable, e.g., incapable of reacting with other ingredients in the carrier. In one example,

                                               18
the carrier does not produce significant local or systemic adverse effect in recipients at
the dosages and concentrations employed for treatment.
[112]      Suitable carriers for the present disclosure include those conventionally used,
e.g., saline, aqueous dextrose, lactose, Ringer's solution, a buffered solution,
hyaluronan and glycols are exemplary liquid carriers, particularly (when isotonic) for
solutions. Suitable pharmaceutical carriers and excipients include starch, cellulose,
glucose, lactose, sucrose, gelatin, malt, rice, flour, chalk, silica gel, magnesium stearate,
sodium stearate, glycerol monostearate, sodium chloride, glycerol, propylene glycol,
water, ethanol, and the like.
[113]      In another example, a carrier is a media composition, e.g., in which a cell is
grown or suspended. For example, such a media composition does not induce any
adverse effects in a subject to whom it is administered.
[114]      Exemplary carriers and excipients do not adversely affect the viability of a cell
and/or the ability of a cell to reduce, prevent or delay metabolic syndrome and/or
obesity.
[115]      In one example, the carrier or excipient provides a buffering activity to
maintain the cells and/or soluble factors at a suitable pH to thereby exert a biological
activity, e.g., the carrier or excipient is phosphate buffered saline (PBS). PBS
represents an attractive carrier or excipient because it interacts with cells and factors
minimally and permits rapid release of the cells and factors, in such a case, the
composition of the disclosure may be produced as a liquid for direct application to the
blood stream or into a tissue or a region surrounding or adjacent to a tissue, e.g., by
injection.
[116]      Stem cells and/or progeny cells thereof can also be incorporated or embedded
within scaffolds that are recipient-compatible and which degrade into products that are
not harmful to the recipient. These scaffolds provide support and protection for cells
that are to be transplanted into the recipient subjects. Natural and/or synthetic
biodegradable scaffolds are examples of such scaffolds.
[117]      A variety of different scaffolds may be used successfully in the practice of the
disclosure. Exemplary scaffolds include, but are not limited to biological, degradable
scaffolds. Natural biodegradable scaffolds include collagen, fibronectin, and laminin

                                              19
scaffolds. Suitable synthetic material for a cell transplantation scaffold should be able
to support extensive cell growth and cell function. Such scaffolds may also be
resorbable. Suitable scaffolds include polyglycolic acid scaffolds, e.g., as described by
Vacanti, et al. J. Ped. Surg. 23:3-9 1988; Cima, et al. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 38:145 1991;
Vacanti, et al. Plast. Reconstr. Surg. 88:753-9 1991; or synthetic polymers such as
polyanhydrides, polyorthoesters, and polylactic acid.
[118]     In another example, the cells may be administered in a gel scaffold (such as
Gelfoam from Upjohn Company).
[119]     The cellular compositions described herein may be administered alone or as
admixtures with other cells. The cells of different types may be admixed with a
composition of the disclosure immediately or shortly prior to administration, or they
may be co-cultured together for a period of time prior to administration.
[120]     In one example, the composition comprises an effective amount or a
therapeutically or prophylactically effective amount of cells. For example, the
composition comprises about 1x10 5 stem cells with elevated Angi levels to about
1x10 7 stem cells with elevated Angi levels or about 1x10 6 stem cells to about 5x10   6
stem cells/kg. The exact amount of cells to be administered is dependent upon a
variety of factors, including the age, weight, and sex of the subject, and the extent and
severity of the disorder being treated.
[121]     In one example, a low dose of cells is administered to the subject. Exemplary
dosages include between about 0.1 x 104 to about 0.5 x 106 cells per kg, for example,
between about 0.1 x 105 to about 0.5 x 106 cells per kg, such as, between about 0.5 x
105 to about 0.5 x 106 cells per kg, for example, between about 0.1 x 106 to about 0.5 x
106 cells per kg, e.g., about 0.2 x 106 or 0.3 x 106 or 0.4 x 106 cells per kg.
[122]     In one example, a high dose of cells is administered to the subject. Exemplary
dosages include at least about 1.5 x 106 cells/kg. For example, a high dose comprises
between about 1.5 x 106 to about 6 x 106 cells/kg, such as between about 1.5 x 106 to
about 5 x 106 cells/kg, for example, between about 1.5 x 106 to about 4 x 106 cells/kg,
for example, between about 1.5 x 106 to about 3 x 106 cells/kg. For example, a high
dose comprises about 1.5 x 106or about 2 x 106 cells/kg.

                                               20
[123]     Other exemplary doses include at least about 1 x 10 cells. For example, a
dose can comprise between about 1.0 x 106 to about lx1010 cells, for example, between
about 1.1 x 106 to about 1x10 9 cells, for example, between about 1.2 x 106 to about 1 x
108 cells, for example, between about 1.3 x 106 to about 1 x 107 cells, for example,
between about 1.4 x 106 to about 9 x 106 cells, for example, between about 1.5 x 106 to
about 8 x 106 cells, for example, between about 1.6 x 106 to about 7 x 106 cells, for
example, between about 1.7 x 106 to about 6 x 106 cells, for example, between about
1.8 x 106 to about 5 x 106 cells, for example, between about 1.9 x 106 to about 4 x 106
cells, for example, between about 2 x 106 to about 3 x 106 cells.
[124]     In one example, the dose comprises between about 5 x 105 to 2 x10 7 cells, for
example, between about 6 x 106 cells to about 1.8 x 107 cells. The dose may be, for
example, about 6 x 10 cells or about 1.8 x 107 cells.
[125]     The mesenchymal lineage precursor or stem cells comprise at least about 5%,
at least about 10%, at least about 15%, at least about 20%, at least about 25%, at least
about 30%, at least about 35%, at least about 40%, at least about 45%, at least about
50%, at least about 55%, at least about 60%, at least about 65%, at least about 70%, at
least about 75%, at least about 80%, at least about 85%, at least about 90%, at least
about 95% of the cell population of the composition.
[126]     In some examples, cells are contained within a chamber that does not permit
the cells to exit into a subject's circulation, however that permits factors secreted by the
cells to enter the circulation. In this manner soluble factors may be administered to a
subject by permitting the cells to secrete the factors into the subject's circulation. Such
a chamber may equally be implanted at a site in a subject to increase local levels of the
soluble factors, e.g., implanted in or near the heart.
[127]     The stem cells of the present disclosure are administered to an animal in an
amount effective to treat a disease or disorder in the animal. The animal may be a
mammal, and the mammal may be a primate, including human and non-human
primates. The stem cells may be administered systemically, such as, for example, by
intravenous, intraarterial, or intraperitoneal administration. The exact dosage of stem
cells to be administered is dependent upon a variety of factors, including, but not

                                             21
limited to, the age, weight, and sex of the patient, the disease(s) or disorder(s) being
treated, and the extent and severity thereof.
[128]     The composition comprising stem cells of the present disclosure may be
cryopreserved. Cryopreservation of stem cells can be carried out using slow-rate
cooling methods or 'fast' freezing protocols known in the art. Preferably, the method of
cryopreservation maintains similar phenotypes, cell surface markers and growth rates
of cryopreserved cells in comparison with unfrozen cells.
[129]     The cryopreserved composition may comprise a cryopreservation solution.
The pH of the cryopreservation solution is typically 6.5 to 8, preferably 7.4.
[130]     The cyropreservation solution may comprise a sterile, non-pyrogenic isotonic
solution such as, for example, PlasmaLyte A@. 100 mL of PlasmaLyte A@ contains
526 mg of sodium chloride, USP (NaCI); 502 mg of sodium gluconate (CH,,NaO7);
368 mg of sodium acetate trihydrate, USP (C2H3NaO 2-3H 2 0); 37 mg of potassium
chloride, USP (KCl); and 30 mg of magnesium chloride, USP (MgCl 2 -6H 2 0). It
contains no antimicrobial agents. The pH is adjusted with sodium hydroxide. The pH is
7.4 (6.5 to 8.0).
[131]     To facilitate freezing, a cryoprotectant such as, for example, dimethylsulfoxide
(DMSO), is usually added to the cryopreservation solution. Ideally, the cryoprotectant
should be nontoxic for cells and patients, nonantigenic, chemically inert, provide high
survival rate after thawing and allow transplantation without washing. However, the
most commonly used cryoprotector, DMSO, shows some cytotoxicity . Hydroxylethyl
starch (HES) may be used as a substitute or in combination with DMSO to reduce
cytotoxicity of the cryopreservation solution.
[132]     The cryopreservation solution may comprise one or more of DMSO,
hydroxyethyl starch, human serum components and other protein bulking agents. In
one example, the cryopreserved solution comprises about 5% human serum albumin
(HSA) and about 10% DMSO. The cryopreservation solution may further comprise one
or more of methycellulose, polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) and trehalose.
[133]     The cryopreserved composition may be thawed and administered directly to
the subject. Alternatively, the cryopreserved composition may be thawed and the

                                             22
mesenchymal lineage precursor or stem cells resuspended in an alternate solution prior
to administration.
Cell Culture Method
[134]     The compositions of the present disclosure can be produced via various cell
culture methods.
[135]     Accordingly, the present disclosure also provides in vitro methods for
inducing Angl expression in stem cells. Surprisingly, the present inventors have
identified cell culture media conditions under which Angl expression is induced in
stem cells. These conditions have also been found to reduce VEGF expression and
induce an elevated ANG1:VEGF ratio.
[136]     For example, these conditions include culturing a population of stem cells in a
cell culture media, wherein the cell culture media contains:
i)        a short acting L-ascorbic acid derivative but does not contain a substantial
          amount of a long acting L-ascorbic acid derivative; and/or
ii)       less than 10% v/v fetal calf serum.
[137]     In another example, these conditions include culturing a population of stem
cells in a cell culture media, wherein the cell culture media contains:
i)        a short acting L-ascorbic acid derivative but does not contain a substantial
          amount of a long acting L-ascorbic acid derivative;
ii)       less than 10% v/v fetal calf serum; and/or
iii)      a non-fetal serum.
[138]     Accordingly, in an embodiment, the present disclosure relates to an in vitro
method for inducing Angl expression in stem cells, the method comprising: culturing a
population of stem cells in a cell culture media, wherein the cell culture media contains
a short acting L-ascorbic acid derivative but does not contain a substantial amount of a
long acting L-ascorbic acid derivative; and/or is supplemented with less than 10% v/v
fetal calf serum.
[139]     In another embodiment, the present disclosure relates to an in vitro method for
inducing Angl expression in stem cells, the method comprising: culturing a population
of stem cells in a cell culture media, wherein the cell culture media contains a short

                                              23
acting L-ascorbic acid derivative but does not contain a substantial amount of a long
acting L-ascorbic acid derivative; and/or is supplemented with a non-fetal serum.
[140]     In another embodiment, the present disclosure relates to an in vitro method for
inducing Angi expression in stem cells, the method comprising: culturing a population
of stem cells in a cell culture media, wherein the cell culture media contains non-fetal
serum in the form of human adult serum (for example, human AB serum) and human
platelet cell lysate in amount sufficient to support growth of cells.
[141]     The term "media" or "medium" as used in reference to cell culture, includes
the components of the environment surrounding the cells. It is envisaged that the
media contributes to and/or provides the conditions sufficient to induce expression of
Angl expression. Media may be solid, liquid, gaseous or a mixture of phases and
materials. Media can include liquid growth media as well as liquid media that do not
sustain cell growth. Media also include gelatinous media such as agar, agarose, gelatin
and collagen matrices. Exemplary gaseous media include the gaseous phase that cells
growing on a petri dish or other solid or semisolid support are exposed to. The term
"medium" also refers to material that is intended for use in a cell culture, even if it has
not yet been contacted with cells.
[142]     The culture media used in the method of the present disclosure can be
prepared by using a culture media used for culturing of stem cells as a basal culture
medium. The basal culture medium includes, for example, Eagles minimal essential
(MEM) culture media, alpha modified MEM culture media, and mixed culture media
thereof, and is not particularly restricted providing it can be used for culturing of stem
cells.
[143]     Further, the culture medium of the present disclosure can contain any
components such as fatty acids or lipids, vitamins, growth factors, cytokines,
antioxidants, buffering agents, inorganic salts and the like.
[144]     The cell culture media used in the present disclosure contains all essential
amino acids and may also contain non-essential amino acids. In general, amino acids
are classified into essential amino acids (Thr, Met, Val, Leu, Ile, Phe, Trp, Lys, His)
and non-essential amino acids (Gly, Ala, Ser, Cys, GIn, Asn, Asp, Tyr, Arg, Pro).

Ascorbic Acid
[145]     Ascorbic acid is an essential supplement for the growth and differentiation of
various kinds of cells in culture. It is now understood that particular ascorbic acid
derivatives are "short acting" because they are not stable in solution, especially under
the normal cell culture conditions of neutral pH and 37 C. These short acting
derivatives rapidly oxidise into oxalic acid or threonic acid. In culture media (pH 7) at
37C, oxidation decreases the level of these short acting ascorbic acid derivatives by
approximately 80 - 90 % in 24 hours. Accordingly, short acting ascorbic acid
derivatives have been replaced with more stable "long acting" ascorbic acid derivatives
in conventional cell culture of various cell types.
[146]     In the context of the present disclosure the term "short acting" encompasses
ascorbic acid derivatives that are oxidised by approximately 80 - 90 %following 24
hours of cell culture under culture conditions of neutral pH and 37 oC. In one example,
the short acting L-ascorbic acid derivative is a L-ascorbic acid salt. For example, in the
context of the present disclosure, L-ascorbic acid sodium salt is a "short acting"
ascorbic acid derivative.
[147]     In contrast, the term "long acting" encompasses ascorbic acid derivatives that
are not oxidised by approximately 80 - 90 %following 24 hours of cell culture under
culture conditions of neutral pH and 37 oC. In one example, in the context of the
present disclosure, L-ascorbic acid-2-phospahte is a "long acting" ascorbic acid
derivative. Other examples of long acting ascorbic acid derivatives include
Tetrahexyldecyl Ascorbate Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate and 2-0-a-D
Glucopyranosyl-L-ascorbic acid.
[148]     The present inventors have surprisingly found that the replacement of a long
acting ascorbic acid derivative with short acting derivative can induce Angl expression
in stem cells. Therefore, in an embodiment of the present disclosure the cell culture
media is supplemented with a short acting ascorbic acid derivative. For example, the
cell culture media may contain at least about 0.005 g/L of a short acting ascorbic acid
derivative. In another example, the cell culture media may contain at least about 0.01
g/L of a short acting ascorbic acid derivative. For example, the cell culture media may
contain at least about 0.02 g/L of a short acting ascorbic acid derivative. In another

                                            25
example, the cell culture media may contain at least about 0.03 g/L of a short acting
ascorbic acid derivative. For example, the cell culture media may contain at least about
0.04 g/L of a short acting ascorbic acid derivative. In another example, the cell culture
media may contain at least about 0.05 g/L of a short acting ascorbic acid derivative. In
another example, the cell culture media may contain at least about 0.06 g/L of a short
acting ascorbic acid derivative. In one example of this embodiment, the cell culture
media is supplemented with sodium salt of L-ascorbate.
[149]    In another example, the cell culture media contains a short acting ascorbic acid
derivative but does not contain a substantial amount of a long acting ascorbic acid
derivative. For example, the cell culture media may contain a short acting ascorbic
acid derivative but not more than 0.04 g/L of a long acting ascorbic acid derivative. In
another example, the cell culture media may contain a short acting ascorbic acid
derivative but not more than 0.03 g/L of a long acting ascorbic acid derivative. In
another example, the cell culture media may contain a short acting ascorbic acid
derivative but not more than 0.02 g/L of a long acting ascorbic acid derivative. In
another example, the cell culture media may contain a short acting ascorbic acid
derivative but not more than 0.01 g/L of a long acting ascorbic acid derivative. In
another example, the cell culture media may contain a short acting ascorbic acid
derivative but not more than 0.005 g/L of a long acting ascorbic acid derivative. In
another example, the cell culture media may contain a short acting ascorbic acid
derivative but not a long acting ascorbic acid derivative.
[150]    In another example, the cell culture media contains L-ascorbate sodium salt
but does not contain a substantial amount of L-ascorbic acid-2-phospahte.
Serum
[151]    The culture media used in the culture method of the present disclosure can be
a serum-containing culture medium or a serum-free culture medium.
[152]    The culture medium of the present disclosure may contain or may not contain
a serum replacement. The serum replacement can be, for example, albumin (for
example, lipid-rich albumin), transferrin, fatty acid, insulin, collagen precursor, trace
element, 2-mercaptoethanol or 3'-thiol glycerol, or those appropriately containing

                                            26
serum equivalents. Such a serum replacement can be prepared, for example, by a
method described in International Publication WO 93/30679, and commercially
available products can also be used.
[153]     Conventionally, stem cells are maintained in cell culture using media
supplemented with at least about 10 - 15% v/v serum, generally fetal calf serum (FCS).
However, the present inventors have found that culturing a population of stem cells in a
cell culture medium supplemented with less than 10% v/v FCS can also induce Angl
expression. In an embodiment, a population of stem cells is cultured in a cell culture
media supplemented with at least about 9% v/v, at least about 8% v/v, at least about 7%
v/v, at least about 6% v/v, at least about 5% v/v, at least about 4% v/v, at least about
3% v/v, at least about 2% v/v, at least about 1%v/v FCS. It also is envisaged that the
term fetal calf serum (FCS) and fetal bovine serum (FBS) can in the context of the
present disclosure be used interchangeably.
[154]     In an embodiment, the cell culture media is supplemented with a non-fetal
serum. It is envisaged that the culture media may be supplemented with at least about
1%v/v, at least about 2% v/v, at least about 3% v/v, at least about 4% v/v, at least
about 5% v/v, at least about 6% v/v, at least about 7% v/v, at least about 8% v/v, at
least about 9%, at least about 10%, at least about 11%, at least about 12%, at least
about 13%, at least about 14%, at least about 15%, at least about 16%, at least about
17%, at least about 18%, at least about 19%, at least about 20%, at least about 21%, at
least about 22%, at least about 23%, at least about 24%, at least about 25% v/v non
fetal serum.
[155]     For example, the culture media can be supplemented with mammalian non
fetal serum.
[156]     For example, the culture media can be supplemented with human non-fetal
serum.
[157]     For example, the culture media can be supplemented with neo-natal serum. It
is envisaged that the culture media may be supplemented with at least about 1% v/v, at
least about 2% v/v, at least about 3% v/v, at least about 4% v/v, at least about 5% v/v,
at least about 6% v/v, at least about 7% v/v, at least about 8% v/v, at least about 9%, at
least about 10%, at least about 11%, at least about 12%, at least about 13%, at least

                                            27
about 14%, at least about 15%, at least about 16%, at least about 17%, at least about
18%, at least about 19%, at least about 20%, at least about 21%, at least about 22%, at
least about 23%, at least about 24%, at least about 25% v/v neo-natal serum.
[158]     In an embodiment, the cell culture media is supplemented with mammalian
neo-natal serum.
[159]     For example, the culture media can be supplemented with new born calf serum
(NBCS). It is envisaged that the culture media may be supplemented with at least
about 1% v/v, at least about 2% v/v, at least about 3% v/v, at least about 4% v/v, at
least about 5% v/v, at least about 6% v/v, at least about 7% v/v, at least about 8% v/v,
at least about 9%, at least about 10%, at least about 11%, at least about 12%, at least
about 13%, at least about 14%, at least about 15%, at least about 16%, at least about
17%, at least about 18%, at least about 19%, at least about 20%, at least about 21%, at
least about 22%, at least about 23%, at least about 24%, at least about 25% v/v NBCS.
[160]     In an embodiment, the cell culture medium is supplemented with human neo
natal serum.
[161]     For example, the cell culture medium can be supplemented with at least about
1% v/v, at least about 2% v/v, at least about 3% v/v, at least about 4% v/v, at least
about 5% v/v, at least about 6% v/v, at least about 7% v/v, at least about 8% v/v, at
least about 9% v/v human neo-natal serum. For example, human neo-natal serum
obtained from umbilical cord blood "cord blood".
[162]     In an embodiment, the culture media is supplemented with adult serum. It is
envisaged that the culture media may be supplemented with at least about 1% v/v, at
least about 2% v/v, at least about 3% v/v, at least about 4% v/v, at least about 5% v/v,
at least about 6% v/v, at least about 7% v/v, at least about 8% v/v, at least about 9%, at
least about 10%, at least about 11%, at least about 12%, at least about 13%, at least
about 14%, at least about 15%, at least about 16%, at least about 17%, at least about
18%, at least about 19%, at least about 20%, at least about 21%, at least about 22%, at
least about 23%, at least about 24%, at least about 25% v/v adult serum.
[163]     In an embodiment, the cell culture media is supplemented with mammalian
adult serum.

                                            28
[164]    For example, the cell culture medium can be supplemented with at least about
1%v/v, at least about 2% v/v, at least about 3% v/v, at least about 4% v/v, at least
about 5% v/v, at least about 6% v/v, at least about 7% v/v, at least about 8% v/v, at
least about 9%, at least about 10%, at least about 11%, at least about 12%, at least
about 13%, at least about 14%, at least about 15%, at least about 16%, at least about
17%, at least about 18%, at least about 19%, at least about 20%, at least about 21%, at
least about 22%, at least about 23%, at least about 24%, at least about 25% v/v
mammalian adult serum.
[165]    For example, the cell culture medium can be supplemented with at least about
1%v/v, at least about 2% v/v, at least about 3% v/v, at least about 4% v/v, at least
about 5% v/v, at least about 6% v/v, at least about 7% v/v, at least about 8% v/v, at
least about 9%, at least about 10%, at least about 11%, at least about 12%, at least
about 13%, at least about 14%, at least about 15%, at least about 16%, at least about
17%, at least about 18%, at least about 19%, at least about 20%, at least about 21%, at
least about 22%, at least about 23%, at least about 24%, at least about 25% v/v adult
bovine serum.
[166]    In an embodiment, the cell culture medium is supplemented with human adult
serum.
[167]    For example, the cell culture medium can be supplemented with at least about
1%v/v, at least about 2% v/v, at least about 3% v/v, at least about 4% v/v, at least
about 5% v/v, at least about 6% v/v, at least about 7% v/v, at least about 8% v/v, at

about 5% v/v, at least about 6% v/v, at least about 7% v/v, at least about 8% v/v, at
least about 9% v/v human AB serum.
[169]    In an example, the cell culture medium is supplemented with at least about 3%
human AB serum.
[170]    In an embodiment the culture media is supplemented with a mixture of FCS
and NBCS.

                                              29
[171]     For example, the culture media can be supplemented with a mixture of FCS
and NBCS so that the FCS:NBCS ratio is at least about 0.4:1, at least about 0.5:1, at
least about 0.6:1, at least about 0.7:1, at least about 0.8:1, at least about 0.9:1, at least
about 1:1, at least about 1.5:1, at least about 2:1.

21%, at least about 22%, at least about 23%, at least about 24%, at least about 25% v/v
of the cell culture media. However, in this example, the cell culture media is

Stimulatory Factors
[177]      In another embodiment the cell culture media is supplemented with one or
more stimulatory factors selected from the group consisting of la,25- dihydroxyvitamin
D3 (1,25D), platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) such as PDGF-BB, tumor necrosis
factor a (TNF- a), interleukin -l4 (IL-1f),stromal derived factor la (SDF-la) and EGF.
[178]      In another embodiment, cells may also be cultured in the presence of at least
one cytokine in an amount sufficient to support growth of the cells.
[179]      In another embodiment, cells are cultured in the presence of platelet cell lysate
in an amount sufficient to support growth of the cells. For example, cells can be
cultured in human platelet cell lysate in an amount sufficient to support growth of the
cells.
[180]      In an example, cells are cultured with human AB serum and human platelet
cell lysate in an amount sufficient to support growth of the cells.
Assaying Therapeutic/Prophylactic Potential of Cells
[181]      Methods for determining the ability of the cells of the present disclosure to
treat or prevent or delay the onset or progression of disorders will be apparent to one of
skill in the art. For example, the present stem cells can be assessed for their ability to
increase Angl levels.
[182]      In one example, genetically unmodified stem cells expressing AngI in an
amount of at least 0.1 pg/10 cells are tested for their ability to increase Angl levels in
vitro and/or in vivo in cardiac tissue. In these examples, Angl levels are assessed in
cell culture medium or tissue after the administration of the presently described stem
cells.
[183]      It will be apparent to the skilled artisan from the foregoing that the present
disclosure also provides a method for identifying or isolating a cell for the treatment,
prevention or delay of a disorder, the method comprising:
           (i)    administering a cell to a test subject suffering from a disorder associated
and assessing a symptom of the disorder in the subject;
           (ii)   comparing the symptom of a disorder of the subject at (i) to the
symptom of the disorder or activity of a control subject suffering from the disorder to

                                            31
which the cell has not been administered, wherein an improvement in the symptom in
the test subject compared to the control subject indicates that the stem cell treats the
disorder. The cell may be any cell described herein according to any example.
[184]     It will be appreciated by persons skilled in the art that numerous variations
and/or modifications may be made to the above-described embodiments, without
departing from the broad general scope of the present disclosure. The present
embodiments are, therefore, to be considered in all respects as illustrative and not
restrictive.
Examples
Example 1: Immunoselection of MPCs by selection of STRO-3* cells
[185]     Bone marrow (BM) is harvested from healthy normal adult volunteers (20-35
years old). Briefly, 40 ml of BM is aspirated from the posterior iliac crest into lithium
heparin anticoagulant-containing tubes.
[186]     BMMNC are prepared by density gradient separation using LymphoprepTM
(Nycomed Pharma, Oslo, Norway) as previously described (Zannettino et al. 1998).
Following centrifugation at 400 x g for 30 minutes at 4*C, the buffy layer is removed
with a transfer pipette and washed three times in "HHF", composed of Hank's balanced
salt solution (HBSS; Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, MID), containing 5% fetal calf
serum (FCS, CSL Limited, Victoria, Australia).
[187]     STRO-3* (or TNAP*) cells were subsequently isolated by magnetic activated
cell sorting as previously described (Gronthos et al. 2003; Gronthos and Simmons
1995). Briefly, approximately 1-3 x 108 BMMNC are incubated in blocking buffer,
consisting of 10% (v/v) normal rabbit serum in HHF for 20 minutes on ice. The cells
are incubated with 200 1 of a 10gg/ml solution of STRO-3 mAb in blocking buffer for
1 hour on ice. The cells are subsequently washed twice in HHF by centrifugation at
400 x g. A 1/50 dilution of goat anti-mouse y-biotin (Southern Biotechnology
Associates, Birmingham, UK) in HHF buffer is added and the cells incubated for 1
hour on ice. Cells are washed twice in MACS buffer (Ca2+- and Mn2+ -free PBS
supplemented with 1%BSA, 5 mM EDTA and 0.0 1%sodium azide) as above and
resuspended in a final volume of 0.9 ml MACS buffer.

                                            32
[188]     One hundred W streptavidin microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec; Bergisch Gladbach,
Germany) are added to the cell suspension and incubated on ice for 15 minutes. The
cell suspension is washed twice and resuspended in 0.5 ml of MACS buffer and
subsequently loaded onto a mini MACS column (MS Columns, Miltenyi Biotec), and
washed three times with 0.5 ml MACS buffer to retrieve the cells which did not bind
the STRO-3 mAb (deposited on 19 December 2005 with American Type Culture
Collection (ATCC) under accession number PTA-7282 - see International Publication
No.WO 2006/108229). After addition of a further 1 ml MACS buffer, the column is
removed from the magnet and the TNAP cells are isolated by positive pressure. An
aliquot of cells from each fraction can be stained with streptavidin-FITC and the purity
assessed by flow cytometry.
[189]     The MPCs isolated in this manner are STRO-Iligh MPCs.
Example 2: Starting culture media - Process A
[190]     The Alpha modification of Eagle's minimum essential media (MEM) with
Earle's balanced salts, commonly referred to as Eagle's Alpha MEM, contains non
essential amino acids, sodium pyruvate, and additional vitamins. These modifications
were first described for use in growing hybrid mouse and hamster cells (Stanners et al.
1971).
[191]     Eagle's Alpha MEM media suitable for culturing primary stem cells can be
obtained from a variety of sources, including Life Technologies and Sigma.
[192]     A detailed method of establishing primary stem cell cultures, including the
required growth factors used in the Exemplified processes is described in Gronthos and
Simmons 1995.
[193]     In Process A, Eagle's Alpha MEM media supplemented with 10% fetal calf
serum, L-ascorbate-2-phosphate (100 pM), dexamethasone (10-7 M) and/or inorganic
phosphate (3 mM) was used for culturing stem cells.
Example 3: Modified culture media - Process B
[194]     In Process B, the Eagle's Alpha MEM culture media used in Process A was
modified (modified Alpha MEM) by:

                                               33
          - replacing the long acting ascorbic acid derivative L-ascorbic acid-2
phosphate with a short acting ascorbic acid derivative Sodium L-ascorbate (50 mg/L);
          - reducing FCS from 10% v/v to 5% v/v;
          - supplementing with non-fetal serum (5% v/v).

Example 4: Cell culture
[196]     Mesenchymal precursor cells (MPCs) were obtained from a single donor and
stored following cryopreservation.
[197]     In general terms, cell culture involved the following steps:
[198]     Cryopreserved MPCs were thawed, seeded at 10,000 cells/cm, and grown in
either starting culture medium (Process A; n=3) or modified culture medium (Process
B; n=3) to 90% confluence at 20% 02, 37'C.
[199]     To generate conditioned medium, growth medium was replaced with EBM-2
basal medium (Lonza) supplemented with FCS at a volume of 200 1 medium/cm2.
Cells were cultured for an additional 3 days after which medium was collected and
centrifuged to remove any cells and the resulting supernatant collected and stored at
80 0C.

                                           34
[200]    Growth factor concentrations were measured using the Luminex platform
using commercially available kits (Millipore).
[201]     Following cell culture, MPC growth dynamics were assessed (see Figures 1
3). No significant changes in cell growth, MPC doubling times or population doubling
times were observed following cell culture Processes A and B.
[202]    MPCs were also characterised in terms of their expression levels of cellular
markers STRO-1, CC9 and STRO-4 as well as pro-angiogenic growth factors Angl and
VEGF.
[203]    STRO-1, CC9 and STRO-4 levels were comparable in MPCs following cell
culture Processes A and B.
[204]    However, culture Process B:
         -   increased AngI levels;

  Example 5: Modified culture conditions - Processes C and D
  [205]    To control for the replacement of the long acting ascorbic acid derivative L
  ascorbic acid-2-phosphate with a short acting ascorbic acid derivative Sodium L
  ascorbate, MPC's from 3 different donors were serially propagated in alpha-MEM +
  10% FCS + 50 mg/L Sodium L-ascorbate (Process C) or alpha-MEM + 3% human AB
  serum +50 mg/L Sodium L-ascorbate (Process D) + growth factors such as PDGF and
  EGF.
  [206]    Angl and VEGF levels were assessed following cell culture in Processes C
  and D. The levels (ug/ml) of Angl and VEGF in the conditioned medium of MPCs
  cultured in Processes C or D are shown in Table 3.
  [207]    Compared with Process C, culture Process D:
           -   increased AngI levels;
           -   reduced VEGF levels;
           -   increased the ratio of Angl:VEGF.
  [208]    Compared with Process A, Processes C and D resulted in progressive
  increases in the expression levels of Angl. This suggests that the presence of a short
  acting ascorbic acid derivative and non-fetal serum each independently result in
  increased Angl expression and together exhibit a synergistic effect in increasing Angl
  expression.
