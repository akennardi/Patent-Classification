[0022]        Figs. 1-2 illustrate a garage door opener system 50 including a garage door opener
100 operatively coupled to a garage door 104. The garage door opener 100 includes a
housing 108 supporting a motor that is operatively coupled to a drive mechanism 116. The
drive mechanism 116 includes a transmission coupling the motor to a drive chain 120 having
a shuttle 124 configured to be displaced along a rail assembly 128 upon actuation of the
motor. The shuttle 124 may be selectively coupled to a trolley 132 that is slidable along the
rail assembly 128 and coupled to the garage door 104 via an arm member.
[0023]        The trolley 132 is releaseably coupled to the shuttle 124 such that the garage door
opener system 50 is operable in a powered mode and a manual mode. In the powered mode,
the trolley 132 is coupled to the shuttle 124 and the motor is selectively driven in response to
actuation by a user (e.g., via a key pad, or wireless remote or smart device in communication
with the garage door opener 100). As the motor is driven, the drive chain 120 is driven by the
motor along the rail assembly 128 to displace the shuttle 124 (and, therefore, the trolley 132),
thereby opening or closing the garage door 104. In the manual mode, the trolley 132 is
decoupled from the shuttle 124 such that a user may manually operate the garage door 104 to
open or close without resistance from the motor. The drive mechanism 116 can be different
for other garage door opener systems 50.
[0024]        The housing 108 is coupled to the rail assembly 128 and a surface above the garage
door (e.g., a garage ceiling or support beam) by, for example, a support bracket 148.
[0025]        The garage door opener 100 further includes an antenna 158 enabling the garage
door opener 100 to communicate wirelessly with other devices.
[0026]        The garage door opener 100 is also configured to receive information (including
control commands) from and /or provide information (including control command) to a
variety of accessory devices (or simply accessories). The accessories may be integrated with,
connected to, interconnected with, or remote from the garage door opener 100. The accessory
devices may include, for example, input accessory devices (or simply input accessories) or
output accessory devices (or simply output accessories). An accessory device may also
provide dual functions of an input accessory and an output accessory. Example accessories
are discussed throughout the document below.
[0027]        The garage door opener 100 includes a light unit 152 including a light (e.g., one or
more light emitting diodes (LEDs)) enclosed by a transparent cover or lens 156. The light
97517251 (GHMalters) P107451.AU

                                                    -5
unit 152 may either be selectively actuated by a user or automatically powered upon actuation
of the garage door opener 100. The light unit 152 is an example of an output accessory
integrated with the garage door opener 100.
[0028]        The garage door opener 100 further includes an obstruction sensor including a
transmitter 198a that emits an infrared beam and a receiver 198b that receives the infrared
beam emitted from the transmitter 198a. The transmitter 198a may be placed on opposite
sides of a garage door opening 199, as illustrated in FIG. 1, and used to detect objects (e.g.,
animals, persons, bicycles) in the path of the garage door. The transmitter 198a and the
receiver 198b may be collectively referred to as an obstruction sensor 198. The obstruction
sensor is an example of a remote input accessory electrically connected to the garage door
opener 100.
[0029]        The garage door opener 100 in Figs. I and 2 shows accessories interconnected with
the garage door opener 100. The accessories are directly connectable and removable from the
garage door opener 100. The shown interconnected accessories are a backup battery unit 190,
a speaker 192, a fan 194, and an extension cord reel 196.
[0030]        Figs. 3A and 3B illustrate a block power diagram of the garage door opener 100.
The garage door opener 100 includes a terminal block 202 configured to receive power from
an external power source 204, such as a standard 120 VAC power outlet. The terminal block
202 directs power, via a transformer 208, to a garage door opener (GDO) board 210 for
supply to components thereof as well as a motor 212 (used to drive the drive mechanism 116),
LEDs 214 (of the light unit 152), and garage door sensors 216. Examples of garage door
sensors 216, which are input accessories, include motion sensors for detecting motion of
objects in a space associated with the garage door, position sensors for detecting garage door
position, and obstruction sensors for detecting objects in the path of the garage door. The
terminal block 202 further directs power via the transformer 208 to a wireless board 220 and
components thereof, as well as a wired keypad 222 (an example condition accessory) and
module ports 223 The terminal block 202 also directs power to a battery charger 224 and AC
ports 228. The module ports 223 are configured to receive various accessory devices, such as
a speaker, a fan, an extension cord reel, a parking assist laser, an environmental sensor, a
flashlight, and a security camera. One or more of the accessory devices are selectively
attachable to and removable from the garage door opener 100, and may be monitored and

[0031]        The wireless board 220 includes a wireless microcontroller 240, among other
components. The GDO board 210 includes, among other components, a garage door opener
(GDO) microcontroller 244 and a radio frequency (RF) receiver 246. The wireless board 220
and the GDO board 210 can be combined as a single board, and the microcontroller 240 and
the microcontroller 244 can be combined as a single microcontroller. The terminology, e.g.,
GDO and wireless, the number of boards, and the number of microcontrollers are exemplary.
[0032]        The microcontrollers 240 and / or 244 can include processors configured to carry out
the functionality described herein attributed thereto via execution of instructions stored on a
compute readable medium (e.g. one of the illustrated memories), can include hardware
circuits (e.g., an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) or field programmable gate
array) configured to perform the functions, or a combination thereof.
[0033]        FIG. 4 illustrates a block communication diagram of the garage door opener 100.
The wireless microcontroller 240 is coupled to the antenna 158 and enables wireless
communication with a server 250 via a network device 252 and network 254, as well as with a
personal wireless device 256, such as a smart phone, tablet, or laptop. The personal wireless
device is an example of an accessory device of the garage door opener system 50 that can
provide dual functions and is remote from the garage door opener. The network device 252
may be, for example, one or more of a router, hub, or modem. The network 254 may be, for
example, the Internet, a local area network (LAN), another wide area network (WAN) or a
combination thereof. In other figures, the network device 252 may be considered part of the
network 254 for simplicity. The wireless microcontroller 240 may include, for example, a
Wi-Fi radio having hardware, software, or a combination thereof enabling wireless
communications according to the Wi-Fi protocol. In embodiments, the wireless
microcontroller 240 is configured to communicate with the server 250 via the network device
252 and network 254 using other wireless communication protocols. The network 254 may
include various wired and wireless connections to communicatively couple the garage door
opener 100 to the server 250. As illustrated, the wireless microcontroller 240 also includes
wired communication capabilities for communicating with the GDO microcontroller 244 via
the multiplexor 260. In some embodiments, the wireless microcontroller 240 and the GDO
microcontroller 244 are directly coupled for communication. As already stated for some
embodiments, the wireless microcontroller 240 and the GDO microcontroller 244 can be
combined into a single controller.

[0034]        The RF receiver 246 wirelessly communicates to various user actuation devices,
including one or more wireless remotes 262 and wireless keypads 264, each of which provide
input accessories, to receive and provide to the GDO microcontroller 244 user actuation
commands (e.g., to open and close the garage door 104). The personal wireless device 256
may also receive user input and, in response, provide (directly or via the network 254) to the
wireless microcontroller 240 user actuation commands for the garage door opener 100 or
commands to control one or more of the accessory devices. Similarly, the garage door opener
100 may provide information to the personal wireless device 256. The multiplexor 260
enables communication between and among the wireless microcontroller 240, the GDO
microcontroller 244, and the accessory microcontrollers 266 (of the accessory devices
previously noted). One of the accessory microcontrollers includes a microcontroller 266B of
a user interface 270. The user interface 270 includes a microphone 275 and speaker 280 for
interfacing with a user. More specifically, in one implementation, a user can provide voice
commands to the garage door opener 100 and receive audible responses from the garage door
opener 100. The microphone 275 and the speaker 280 can be directly connected to the
wireless MCU 240 and the functionality of the microcontroller 266B can be integrated with
the microcontroller of the wireless MCU 240. It is also envisioned that the user interface 270
can be disposed remote from the garage door opener and in communication with the garage
door opener 100 either wired or wirelessly.
[0035]        FIG. 5 illustrates a diagram of select components of a garage door opener system 50
including the garage door opener 100. The garage door opener 100 includes an intelligent
automated assistant (IAA) controller 330. Only select components of the IAA controller 330
are illustrated including a processor (e.g., an electronic processor) 350, and a memory 355.
The IAA controller 330 may be part of the wireless microcontroller 240 and / or part of the
GDO microcontroller 244 (FIG. 4) and /or include its own microcontroller. The processor
350 and memory 355 are in communication with the user interface 270 via a communication
bus 360, which may include the multiplexor 260 (FIG. 4). The memory 355 includes a first
nonvolatile memory block 365 storing instructions 370 and a second nonvolatile memory
block 375 storing operation information 380.
[0036]        The garage door opener system 50 further includes accessories 382 including input
accessories 382A and output accessories 382B. Some accessories (e.g., accessories 382C)
can be both input and output; i.e., input / output accessories 382C. Also, some accessories
97517251 (GHMalters) P107451.AU

                                                  -8
382 can be located remote from the garage door opener 100 and wired to the garage door
opener 100, some accessories can be located remote from the garage door opener 100 and
communicate wirelessly to the wireless controller 330 directly, and some accessories 382 can
be located remote from the garage door opener 100 and communicate wirelessly to a wireless
transceiver 345 through the network 254. The wireless transceiver 345 may be part of or
coupled to the wireless microcontroller 240 within the garage door opener 100.
[0037]        One example of an input accessory 382A is the obstruction sensor 198 of Fig. 1. The
obstruction sensor 198 may be configured to output a first signal to the processor 350 when
the beam from the transmitter 198a is received by the receiver 198b and not obstructed (e.g.,
by an object), and to output a second signal to the processor 350 when the beam is obstructed.
[0038]        Another example of an input accessory 382A is one or more condition sensing
components configured to sense a condition associated with the garage door opener 100 or an
associated space thereof, and output an indication of the sensed condition to the garage door
opener 100. In some embodiments, the condition sensing component is hardwired to or
integrated into the garage door opener 100. The condition sensing component may include
one or more motion sensors for detecting motion of objects in a space associated with the
garage door opener 100, position sensors for detecting a position of the garage door 104, door
sensors for detecting a position (e.g., open or closed) of a hinged door or lid (independent of
the garage door 104), or a combination thereof. Each motion sensor provides an indication to
garage opener 100 upon detecting motion in a sensing region covered by the motion sensor.
The space associated with a garage door opener 100 in which the motion sensors are detecting
motion may be, for example, an area within the garage in which the garage door opener 100 is
located or an area within infrared line-of-sight of the garage in which the garage door opener
100 is located. In other words, in some embodiments, the motion sensors may be attached to
the garage in which the garage door opener 100 is located, on an internal portion of the garage
or on an external portion of the garage. In some embodiments, the space associated with the
garage door opener 100 includes a path associated with the garage, such as along a driveway.
In some embodiments, multiple motion sensors are aimed at different spaces associated with
the garage door opener 100, and the garage door opener 100 is, therefore, configured to
determine whether motion is occurring in any of multiple different spaces associated with the
garage door opener 100.

                                                   -9
[0039]        In some embodiments, the position sensors for detecting a position of the garage
door 104 include an optical sensor aimed at the garage door 104 that outputs data to the
processor 350 indicative of the position and movement of the garage door 104. In some
embodiments, the position sensors are configured to track movement of the motor 212 or
another component mechanically coupled to the garage door 104, and to output data
indicative of the position and movement of the garage door 104. Based on the output data of
the one or more position sensors, the processor 350 is operable to determine the position of
the garage door 104.
[0040]        In some embodiments, the door sensors detect whether a hinged door (e.g., providing
access for individuals to the garage in which the garage door opener 100 is located) is open or
closed. In some embodiments, the door sensors detect whether a hinged lid or door of a safe,
cabinet, trunk, or the like, is open or closed. The door sensors provide an indication of
whether the hinged door is open or closed to the processor 350. Each of the condition sensing
components. in addition to the indicators provided to the processor 350, may provide an
identifier to the processor 350 such that the processor 350 is operable to determine which of
the condition sensing components is providing the indication.
[0041]        One example of an output accessory 382B is a lock for the garage door, a hinged lid,
or an entry door. In some embodiments, the garage door opener 100 can send an output to the
lock for locking or unlocking the lid or door. In some embodiments, the garage door opener
100 can send an output to the lock for locking or unlocking the lid or door. In addition to
door sensors and locks, similar accessories are provided for locking or unlocking one or more
windows.
[0042]        Another example of an output accessory 382B is a tracker device. The tracker device
can include visual and / or audible output for communication with a user. For example, the
tracker device can provide an audible beep and /or illumination in response to a commanded
stimulus from the garage door opener 100.
[0043]        While only a finite number of accessories 382 are illustrated in FIG. 5, the garage
door opener system 50 may include many more accessories and is only limited based on the
systems capabilities. Additionally, as can be appreciated based on the below description, a
particular accessory device 382 of the garage door opener 100 may, in a first moment in time,
97517251 (GHMalters) P107451.AU

                                                    - 10
be considered an input accessory 382A and, in a second moment in time, be an output
accessory 382B, or dual input / output accessory 382C.
[0044]        FIG. 6 illustrates a block diagram of the accessory (e.g., an electronic accessory)
382. The block diagram is applicable to each of the types of accessories 382A-C. As
illustrated, the accessory 382 includes a controller 405 having a memory 410 and an accessory
processor (e.g., an electronic accessory processor) 415, one or more sensors 420, and one or
more loads 425 coupled by a bus 430. The accessory 382 further includes a power supply 435
that conditions and filters input power, and provides the power to the other components of the
accessory 382. The controller 405 executes software, which may be stored in memory 410, to
carry out the functions of the accessory 382 described herein. The particular sensors 420,
loads 425, and functions of the controller 405 vary depending on the type of accessory 382.
For example, in some embodiments, the accessory 382 does not include one of the sensors
420; and, in other embodiments, the accessory 382 does not include one of the loads 425. The
controller 405 may be, for example, the microcontroller 266 for each accessory noted above
with respect to FIG. 4.
[0045]        The accessory 382 is coupled to the garage door opener 100 via an interface 440 to
enable data communications between the controller 405 and the garage door opener 100 and
to provide power to the accessory 382 from the garage door opener 100. In some
embodiments, the accessory 382 is selectively attachable to and removable from the garage
door opener 100. In such embodiments, the interface 440 includes an electro-mechanical
connector enabling the physical mounting of the accessory 382 to the garage door opener 100
and an electrical connection for power and data transmission between the accessory 382 and
the garage door opener 100.
[0046]        In some embodiments, the accessory 382 is wirelessly connected to and physically
disconnected from the garage door opener 100. In such instances, the accessory 382 includes
a wireless transceiver 445 for communicating with the garage door opener 100, and the power
supply 435 includes a separate power source (e.g., a replaceable battery, photovoltaic cells,
and the like). Accordingly, the interface 440 includes a wireless connection for
communication (e.g., between the wireless transceiver 445 and the wireless transceiver 345
(FIG. 5)), and is without a physical communication connection and power connection to the
garage door opener 100. In some embodiments, the accessory 382 includes the wireless
transceiver 445 for communicating with the garage door opener 100 and a physical power
97517251 (GHMalters) P107451.AU

                                                    - 11
connection to the garage door opener 100, but is without a physical communication
connection. In further embodiments, the accessory 382 does not include the wireless
transceiver 445 and, rather, uses a physical communication connection and power connection
of the interface 440.
[0047]        In certain embodiments, the garage door opener 100 includes an intelligent
automated assistant (IAA) supported by the IAA controller 330. For example, in one
embodiment, the memory 355 stores IAA software instructions that are retrieved and executed
by the processor 350 to implement the IAA. The user interface 270, which was described in
one embodiment as including a microphone 275 and speaker 280, can include an alternative
input such as a keyboard, touchscreen, mouse, touch pad, trackball, joystick, motion sensors,
and combinations thereof and an alternative output such as a screen, display, or printer. In
some embodiments, the IAA is located in other accessory devices in communication with the
garage door opener 100, or even standalone components, such as a jobsite radio 700, a battery
charger 705, an energy storage system 710, and a standalone home hub 715, examples of
which are shown in FIG. 7A. Each standalone component includes, in addition to elements
typical of each type of device (e.g., for the jobsite radio 700, a radio tuner, radio and volume
settings buttons, and a power source, among other elements), one or more of the IAA
controller 330, the user interface 270, and the wireless transceiver 345, and may also be
coupled to one or more of the accessory devices 382A-C.
[0048]        FIG. 7B illustrates a flowchart 750 for controlling the garage door opener system 50
having the IAA controller 330. In step 755, the processor 350 (i.e., an electronic processor of
the garage door opener 100) controls the motor 212 of the garage door opener 100 to move
the garage door 104. For example, a user may enter a command to open or close the garage
door. The command may be entered via an indoor or outdoor keypad (e.g., the keypads 222,
264), a car remote control (e.g., the car remote 262), a microphone as a voice command (e.g.,
the microphone 275), or a wireless remote or smart device (e.g., phone 256) in
communication with the garage door opener 100. The IAA controller 330 may receive and
interpret the garage door open or close command and activate the motor 212 to open or close
the garage door as described further with respect to FIGS. 1-2.
[0049]        In step 760, the processor 350 detects a command from a user via the microphone
275 of the user communication interface 270 of the garage door opener 100. The microphone
275 may be located in or near the garage door opener 100, for example, installed in a garage
97517251 (GHMalters) P107451.AU

                                                   - 12
or in a vehicle. The microphone 275 may be wired to the garage door 100 or may be
wirelessly connected via the wireless transceiver 345. The microphone 275 captures user
audio data, for example, commands or requests that activate one or more of the accessories
382, and the audio data is transmitted to the processor 350. The processor 350 may have
voice recognition software to identify commands in the audio data, or may send the audio data
via the wireless transceiver 345 and the network 254 to a server that executes voice
recognition software, and the server returns command identifiers to the processor 350. In one
embodiment, the voice recognition software of the garage door opener 100 may compare the
captured audio data, in whole or parsed into segments, to stored audio data of known voice
commands to identify a match, or the processor 350 may be operable to use other methods of
voice recognition such as natural language recognition techniques. In some embodiments, the
server may have more advanced voice recognition software than the garage door opener 100,
and the processor 350 may forward audio data to the server when it is not able to recognize a
command in the audio data. For example, the server may utilize grammar based or natural
language recognition to interpret the captured audio data and may recognize one or more
commands for the processor 350. The server may respond to the processor 350 with an
identified voice command recognized from the audio data.
[0050]        In step 765, the processor 350 generates a responsive control action to control one or
more of the garage door opener accessories (i.e., accessory devices 382A-C) of the garage
door opener to implement the user command. Once the IAA software of the processor 350
has determined or identified the user command, the processor 350 may identify which
accessory 382 to activate, and which accessory commands to issue to the identified accessory
382. For example, the user command may indicate which accessory 382 to activate and an
operation. Accessory commands associated with the identified accessory and operation may
be retrieved from the memory 380. An accessory command may comprise data or code that
indicates steps for the accessory 382 to take, for example, activate a load 425 or read a sensor
420. The accessory commands may be wirelessly transmitted to an accessory 382 via the
transceivers 345 and 445, and software executed by the accessory processor 415 within the
accessory 382 may identify the accessory command and carry out any instructions identified
within the accessory command. In some embodiments, the accessory command may indicate
to the accessory processor 415 to activate a load 425 in the accessory, for example, open a
lock, or turn on a radio.
97517251 (GHMalters) P107451.AU

                                                   - 13
[0051]        In some embodiments, the responsive action includes the processor 350 reading or
retrieving information, and then conveying the received information to respond to the user
command. For example, the users command may have requested a battery charge level of a
power tool battery (an example accessory). The processor 350 may wirelessly send an
accessory command to the power tool battery, via the wireless transceivers 345 and 445, to
read the battery charge level from the sensor 420 or memory 410, and report the charge level
in an audible notification via a speaker load 425 in the power tool battery. Alternatively, the
processor 350 may wirelessly request the battery charge level information from the power tool
accessory 382. The power tool accessory 382 may read the battery charge level from the
sensor 420 or memory 410 and wirelessly transmit the charge level to the garage door opener
100 via the transceivers 445 and 345. The processor 350 may then respond to the user by
sending an audible notification of the power tool battery charge level via a speaker of the
garage door opener 100, or by sending a message to the user's wireless device via the wireless
transceiver 345 and the network 254.
[0052]        In some embodiments, the command in step 760 is an operational command received
when the processor 350 is in an operational command listening mode, which was entered
because of a previously received wake-up command. More particularly, a user may initiate
the IAA through a wake-up command, such as an initial verbal input or gesture input. The
wake-up command can be detected by the user interface 270, such as by the microphone 275
or motion sensors 280. An example verbal wake-up command may be "hey system."
Example operational commands include the example user commands discussed above.
[0053]        In response to detecting the wake-up command., the processor 350 enters into the
operational command listening mode. The processor 350 may remain in the operational
command listening mode for the shorter of a predetermined length of time (a listening time
period) and the detection of an operational command. In the operational command listening
mode, the user can then provide more focused operation command(s) to the garage door
opener system 50 using the user interface 270. With the operational command, the user can
cause the processor 350 to control a particular output accessory 382B or input-output
accessory 382C to perform an output function, as described above.
[0054]        The wake-up command can be combined with various operational commands. For
example, the user may command a particular light of the garage door opener system 50 to
illuminate through a voice command (e.g., "hey system, turn on garage light to 75%
97517251 (GHMalters) P107451.AU

                                                  - 14
brightness"). As another example command, a user can verbally instruct the garage door to
open (e.g., "hey system, open garage door"). Yet alternatively, a user can locate an accessory
382, such as a battery or a small tracker device, via a voice command (e.g., "hey system, find
holiday lights"). The command can cause the battery or the small tracker to provide audible
(beep) or visual (light flashing) clues, for example, to indicate its location.
[0055]        Fig. 8 shows an example of a user communicating with the personal wireless device
256 to locate an accessory 382, in the form of the small tracker device, via the IAA of the
garage door opener 100. The personal wireless device 256 may receive the user command via
a GUI or voice input, for example, and communicate the user command to the garage door
opener 100 via the network 254, or directly via a wireless link with the transceiver 345, such
as a Bluetooth connection. As described above in step 760, the processor 350 of the garage
door opener 100 may identify the user command and determine an accessory command to
wirelessly communicate to the small tracker device, for example, via the transceivers 345 and
445. The small tracker device may receive the accessory command comprising data or code
that indicates an action, and determine that the command indicates that an audible or visual
alert be communicated via a speaker load 425 or a light load 425. The audible or visual alert
by the tracker device may indicate to the user the location of an object to be found that may be
located near or attached to the small tracker device. In another embodiment, the user
command to locate the tracker device is provided via the microphone 275 to the garage door
opener 100 and interpreted by voice recognition software as noted above with respect to step
760.
[0056]        In another embodiment, the processor 330 issues a command to cause the accessory
382, in the form of a lock, e.g., of a tool box, paint cabinet, or door, to lock or unlock (e.g.,
"hey system, unlock paint cabinet" or "hey system, lock back door"). The locking accessory
382 may comprise a load 425 that may be a solenoid that controls a locking element of the
lock in response to the command from the processor 330. The locking accessory 382 may
receive and identify the command, and provide power from the power supply 435 to actuate
the solenoid load 425 to engage or disengage a locking mechanism in accessory 382.
[0057]        In some embodiments, push commands are provided to the user through the IAA.
The garage door opener 100, via the speaker 192 or 280, can provide notification to the user
when a door or winding is opened as detected by a contact sensor (e.g., a sensor 420 of the
accessory 382A). Another push notification is for motion happening in the garage (from the
97517251 (GHMalters) P107451.AU

                                                   - 15
GDO's built in motion sensor) or get notification for motion happening outside the garage
(from a motion sensor in a separate housing that is not physically connected to the GDO).
[0058]        In some embodiments, further intelligence can be added to the IAA controller 330
via firmware updates periodically or on-the-fly upon receiving a user command that is not
known on the local IAA controller 330. For example, the IAA controller 330 can be coupled
to the server 250 (Fig. 4) via the network 254 (Fig. 4) allowing for greater sophistication with
the IAA. A user can ask the IAA to provide detailed information to the user not normally
available from a garage door opener.
[0059]        Fig. 9 shows a user communicating with a personal wireless device 256 to acquire
information from the vehicle having the accessory 382C, via the IAA controller 330 of the
garage door opener 100. The user may input a command that requests vehicle status via a
GUI or voice command in the personal wireless device 256, and the personal wireless device
256 communicates the command to the garage door opener 100 via then network 254, or
directly via a Bluetooth connection. Alternatively, the user may directly express a voice
command for vehicle status to the garage door opener 110 via a microphone 275. As
described above with respect to steps 760 and 765, the processor 330 interprets the user
command for vehicle status and transmits an accessory command to the accessory 382C in the
vehicle. In response to the request for vehicle status, the accessory 382C reads one or more
vehicle sensors 420 or the memory 410 to access the vehicle status information, for example,
the accessory 382C reads odometer and oil status information. The accessory processor 415
communicates the vehicle status information to the garage door opener 100 via the wireless
transceivers 445 and the transceiver 345. The garage door opener controller 330 responds to
the personal wireless device 256 by communicating the vehicle status via the transceiver 345
and the network 254 to the wireless device 256. The wireless device 256 may then present
the vehicle status information to the user.
[0060]        Fig. 10 shows a user directly communicating with the IAA controller 330 of the
garage door opener 100 to acquire information from a server 250 with the assistance of the
IAA controller 330. The user may speak to the microphone 275 and request information (e.g.,
"hey system, what was step 3 for replacing these plugs?"). Voice recognition software in the
controller 330 may recognize the user's request in audio data received from the microphone
275, and forward the request to the server 250 via the transceiver 345 and the network 254.
The server 250 may return a response to the user's request and the controller 330 may use text
97517251 (GHMalters) P107451.AU

                                                   - 16
to speech software to generate a voice response and communicate the response to the user via
the speaker 280. In another embodiment, the controller 330 may receive the user request
audio data from the microphone 175 and may forward the audio data to the server 250 to for
voice recognition of the user's request, and to determine the response to the user's request.
[0061]        The IAA controller 330 can intelligently control accessory devices 382 coupled to
the garage door opener 100. For example, a user may control the functionality of a job site
radio 700 via the IAA controller 330. The user may voice a request or command to the
microphone 275 to activate the radio, change radio volume or change a radio station (e.g.,
"hey system, turn up the radio"). Voice recognition software in the controller 330 may
receive the audio data from the microphone 275 and recognize the user's request to raise the
volume using voice recognition software. The controller 330 may generate and transmit a
volume control command to the radio 700 via the transceivers 345 and 445 and, in response,
the controller 405 in the radio 700 increases the volume of the radio 700. Fig. 11 shows
various interactions with accessories 382 via the IAA controller 330 of the garage door opener
100. A user may communicate via the phone 256 to the garage door opener 100 to configure
the IAA controller 330, to control operation of accessories 382 such as a cabinet door lock, a
tracker device's audible or illuminating alert, a radio or music player, a side door lock, and/or
a drawer lock, at a specified time or in response to a command. For example, the user may
enter a request to "play Porter's jams" via the personal wireless device 256 using a voice
command into a microphone in the device 256, or by inputting the command via a user
interface, for example, a touch screen and a GUI. The personal wireless device 256 may
communicate the user request to the garage door opener 100 via the network 254 or via a
Bluetooth connection with the garage door opener 100, for example. The controller 330 may
detect the user's command to play Porter's jams from the personal wireless device 256, and
generate and wirelessly transmit a command to a music player via the transceivers 345 and
445. In response, the controller 405 in the music player selects a play list identified as
Porter's jams and outputs a song from the playlist via a speaker in the music player. In
another embodiment, the user may request that the command take effect a specified time. In
this regard, the controller 330 may wait to deliver the command to the music player until the
specified time is detected, for example, based on an internal clock, GPS, or from the server
254.
