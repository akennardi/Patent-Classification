 5 FIELD OF THE INVENTION
   The present invention relates to compositions and methods for preparing splice variants of
   TNFalpha receptor (TNFR) in vivo or in vitro, and the resulting TNFR protein variants. Such
   variants may be prepared by controlling the splicing of pre-mRNA molecules and regulating
   protein expression with splice switching oligonucleotides or splice switching oligomers
10 (SSOs).    The preferred SSOs according to the invention target exon 7 or 8 of TNFR1
   (TNFRSF1A) or TNFR2 (TNFRSF1A) pre-mRNA, typically resulting in the production of TNFR
   variants which comprise a deletion in part or the entire exon 7 or 8 respectfully. SSOs
   targeting exon 7 are found to result in a soluble form of the TNFR, which has thereputic
   benefit for treatment of inflammatory diseases. The SSO's are characterized in that they are
15 substantially incapable or incapable of recruiting RNaseH.
   BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
   W02007/05889, hereby incorporated by reference, provides a description of the background
   art relating to pre-mRNA splicing, the role of TNF-alpha in inflammation and inflammatory
   disorders, and the mediation of TNF-alpha activity via TNF1 and TNF2.
20 TNF-alpha is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that exists as a membrane-bound homotrimer and
   is released into the circulation by the protease TNF-alpha converting enzyme (TACE). TNF
   alpha is introduced into the circulation as a mediator of the inflammatory response to injury
   and infection. TNF-alpha activity is implicated in the progression of inflammatory diseases
   such as rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, psoriasis and psoriatic
25 arthritis (Palladino, M.A., et al., 2003, Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2:736-46). The acute exposure
   to high levels of TNF-alpha, as experienced during a massive infection, results in sepsis; its
   symptoms include shock, hypoxia, multiple organ failure, and death. Chronic low doses of
   TNF-alpha can cause cachexia, a disease characterized by weight loss, dehydration and fat
   loss, and is associated with malignancies.
30 TNF-alpha activity is mediated primarily through two receptors coded by two different genes,
   TNFR1 and TNFR2. TNFR1 is a membrane-bound protein with a molecular weight of
   approximately 55 kilodaltons (kDa), while TNFR2 is a membrane-bound protein with a
   molecular weight of 75 kDa. The soluble extracellular domains of both receptors are shed to
   some extent from the cell membrane by the action of metalloproteases. Moreover, the pre-

     WO 2008/131807                                   2                     PCT/EP2007/061211
   mRNA of TNFR2 undergoes alternative splicing, creating either a full length, active
   membrane-bound receptor (mTNFR2), or a secreted decoy receptor (sTNFR2) that lacks
   exons 7 and 8 which encompasses the coding sequences for the transmembrane (Lainez et
   al, 2004, Int. Immunol, 16:169). The sTNFR2 binds TNF-alpha but does not elicit a
 5 physiological response, thus reducing TNF-alpha activity. Although an endogenous, secreted
   splice variant of TNFR1 has not yet been identified, the similar gene structures of the two
   receptors strongly suggest the potential to produce this TNFR1 isoform.
   Because of the role played by excessive activity by TNF superfamily members, it is useful to
   control the alternative splicing of TNFR receptors so that the amount of the secreted form is
10 increased and the amount of the integral membrane form is decreased. The present invention
   provides splice switching oligonucleotides or splice switching oligomers (SSOs) to achieve this
   goal. SSOs are similar to antisense oligonucleotides (ASONs). However, in contrast to ASON,
   SSOs are able to hybridize to a target RNA without causing degradation of the target by
   RNase H.
15 SSOs have been used to modify the aberrant splicing found in certain thalassemias (U.S. Pat.
   No. 5,976,879 to KoIe; Lacerra, G., et al., 2000, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 97:9591). Studies
   with the IL-5 receptor alpha-chain (IL-5Ralpha) demonstrated that SSOs directed against the
   membrane-spanning exon increased synthesis of the secreted form and inhibited synthesis of
   the integral membrane form (U.S. Pat. No. 6,210,892 to Bennett; Karras, J.G., et al., 2000,
20 MoL Pharm, 58:380). WOOO/58512 also discloses examples of redirecting the splicing of IL
   5R to soluble forms (examples 25 and 30).
   SSOs have been used to produce the major CD40 splice variant detected in Tone, in which
   deletion of exon 6, which is upstream of the transmembrane region, resulted in an altered
   reading frame of the protein. While the SSO resulted in the expected mRNA splice variant,
25 the translation product of the variant mRNA appeared to be unstable because the secreted
   receptor could not be detected (Siwkowski, A.M., et al., 2004, Nucleic Acids Res. 32; 2695).
   Tone et al., PNAS, 2001, 98(4):1751-1756 predicts that the mouse splice variant lacking
   exon 6 would not be a stable, secreted form of CD40 (see page 1756, right hand column.
   W002/088393 discloses gapmer oligonucleotides having 2'MOE wings and a deoxy gap,,
30 which are targeted to mouse TNFR2 - these oligonucleotides are designed to recruit RNAseH
   to degrade the TNFR2 mRNA (mRNA down-regulation). The SSO oligonucleotides of the
   present invention are designed not to recruit RNaseH, but to disrupt the processing of the
   TNFR pre-mRNA, resulting in stable, secreted, ligand-binding TNFR splice variants.
   US2005/202531 teaches that antisense oligonucleotides may be used to alter the alternative
35 splicing pattern of CD40, however, it does not teach or provide any guidance as to splice

   elements or regions of CD40 that should be targeted by SSOs or any guidance as to which
   sequences should be used.

   integral membrane form is decreased.

   represented by boxes and lines, respectively. The signal sequence and the transmembrane
   region are shaded. Residues that form the boundaries of the signal sequence, the
   transmembrane region, and the final residue are indicated below the diagram. Exon
   boundaries are indicated above the diagram; if the 3' end of an exon and the 5' end of the
15 following exon have the same residue number, then the splice junction is located within the
   codon encoding that residue.

20 DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
   The present invention provides compositions and methods for controlling expression of TNF
   receptors (TNFR1 and TNFR2) and of other cytokine receptors from the TNFR superfamily by
   controlling the splicing of pre-mRNA that code for the said receptors. More specifically, the
   invention causes the increased expression of the secreted form and the decreased expression
25 of the integral-membrane form. Furthermore, the invention can be used in the treatment of
   diseases associated with excessive cytokine activity.
   The exon or exons that are present in the integral membrane form mRNA but are removed
   from the primary transcript (the "pre-mRNA") to make a secreted form mRNA are termed the
   "transmembrane exons." The invention involves nucleic acids and nucleic acid analogs that
30 are complementary to either of the transmembrane exons and/or adjacent introns of a
   receptor pre-mRNA. Complementarity can be based on sequences in the sequence of pre
   mRNA that spans the splice site, which would include, but is not limited to, complementarity
   based on sequences that span the exon-intron junction, or complementarity can be based
   solely on the sequence of the intron, or complementarity can be based solely on the
35 sequence of the exon.

   There are several alternative chemistries available and known to those skilled in the art. One
   important feature is the ability to hybridize to a target RNA without causing degradation of
   the target by RNase H as do 2'-deoxy oligonucleotides ("antisense oligonucleotides" hereafter
   "ASON"). For clarity, such compounds will be termed splice- switching oligomers (SSOs).
 5 Those skilled in the art appreciate that SSO include, but are not limited to, 2' O-modified
   oligonucleotides and ribonucleosidephosphorothioates as well as peptide nucleic acids and
   other polymers lacking ribofuranosyl-based linkages.
   One embodiment of the invention is a method of treating an inflammatory disease or
   condition by administering SSOs to a patient or a live subject. The SSOs that are
10 administered alter the splicing of a pre-mRNA to produce a splice variant that encodes a
   stable, secreted, ligand-binding form of a receptor of the TNFR superfamily, thereby
   decreasing the activity of the ligand for that receptor. In another embodiment, the invention
   is a method of producing a stable, secreted, ligand-binding form of a receptor of the TNFR
   superfamily in a cell by administering SSOs to the cell.
15 One embodiment of the invention is a protein, either full length or mature, which can bind
   TNF, is encoded by a cDNA derived from a mammalian TNFR gene, and in the cDNA exon 6 is
   followed directly by exon 8 and as a result lacks exon 7 ("TNFR 67"). In another
   embodiment, the invention is a pharmaceutical composition comprising a TNFR 67. In a
   further embodiment, the invention is a method of treating an inflammatory disease or
20 condition by administering a pharmaceutical composition comprising a TNFR 67.
   In yet another embodiment, the invention is a nucleic acid that encodes a TNFR 67. In a
   further embodiment, the invention is a pharmaceutical composition comprising a nucleic acid
   that encodes a TNFR 67.
   In another embodiment, the invention is an expression vector comprising a nucleic acid that
25 encodes a TNFR 67. In a further embodiment, the invention is a method of increasing the
   level of a soluble TNFR in the serum of a mammal by transforming cells of the mammal with
   an expression vector comprising a nucleic acid that encodes a TNFR 67.
   In another embodiment, the invention is a cell transformed with an expression vector
   comprising a nucleic acid that encodes a TNFR 67. In a further embodiment, the invention is
30 a method of producing a TNFR 67 by culturing, under conditions suitable to express the TNFR
   67, a cell transformed with an expression vector comprising a nucleic acid that encodes a
   TNFR 67. In yet another embodiment, the invention is a method of treating an inflammatory
   disease or condition by administering an expression vector comprising a nucleic acid that
   encodes a TNFR 67.

     WO 2008/131807                                  12                    PCT/EP2007/061211
   In yet another embodiment, splice-switching oligomers (SSOs) are disclosed that alter the
   splicing of a mammalian TNFR2 pre-mRNA to produce a mammalian TNFR2 protein, which
   can bind TNF and where exon 6 is followed directly by exon 8 and as a result lacks exon 7
   ("TNFR2 67"). One embodiment of the invention is a method of treating an inflammatory
 5 disease or condition by administering SSOs to a patient or a live subject. The SSOs that are
   administered alter the splicing of a mammalian TNFR2 pre-mRNA to produce a TNFR2 67. In
   another embodiment, the invention is a method of producing a TNFR2 67 in a cell by
   administering SSOs to the cell.
   The foregoing and other objects and aspects of the present invention are discussed in detail
10 in the drawings herein and the specification set forth below.

   may be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 nucleobases in length. DNA or RNA nucleobases which are at the
   termini of the oligomer of the invention are expected to be cleaved from the oligomer when
   used in vivo by endogenous exo-nucleases - as such the includion of flanking DNA or RNA
   units may not affect the in vivo performance of the oligomer.
20 In one embodiment, the 3' end of the contiguous nucleobase sequence is flanked by 1, 2 or 3
   DNA or RNA units. 3', DNA units are frequently used during solid state synthesis of

   corresponding region of contiguous nucleotides present in SEQ ID NO 1 or SEQ ID NO 2, SEQ
   ID NO 3, or SEQ ID NO 4 ( i.e. said contiguous nucleobase sequence is present in a region

   sequence does not comprise 5 or more contiguous DNA (2'-deoxyribosnucleoside) monomer
   units.

   Splice-switchingoligomers (SSOs):
25 In another aspect, the present invention employs splice switching oligonucleotides or splice
   switching oligomers (SSOs) to control the alternative splicing of TNFR2 so that the amount of
   a soluble, ligand-binding form that lacks exon 7 is increased and the amount of the integral
   membrane form is decreased. The methods and compositions of the present invention can
   be used in the treatment of diseases associated with excessive tnf activity.
30 Accordingly, one embodiment of the invention is a method of treating an inflammatory
   disease or condition by administering SSOs to a patient. The SSOs that are administered
   alter the splicing of a pre-mRNA to produce a mammalian TNFR2 protein that lacks exon 7.

     WO 2008/131807                                   17                    PCT/EP2007/061211
   In another embodiment, the invention is a method of producing a mammalian TNFR2 protein
   that lacks exon 7 in a cell by administering SSOs to the cell.
   The length of the SSO (i.e. The number of monomers in the oligomer) is similar to an
   antisense oligonucleotide (ASON), typically between about 8 and 30 nucleotides. In
 5 preferred embodiments, the SSO will be between about 10 to 16 nucleotides. The invention
   can be practiced with SSOs of several chemistries that hybridize to RNA, but that do not
   activate the destruction of the RNA by RNAseH, as do conventional antisense 2'-deoxy
   oligonucleotides. The invention can be practiced using 2'o modified nucleic acid oligomers,
   such as where the 2'O is replaced with -O-CH 3, -O-CH 2-CH2-O-CH 3, -O-CH 2-CH2 -CH2-NH 2, -0
10 CH2-CH2-CH2-OH or -F, where 2'O-methyl or 2'O-methyloxyethyl is preferred. The
   nucleobases do not need to be linked to sugars; so-called peptide nucleic acid oligomers or
   morpholine-based oligomers can be used. A comparison of these different linking chemistries
   is found in Sazani, p. et a., 2001, nucleic acids res. 29:3695. The term splice-switching
   oligonucleotide is intended to cover the above forms. Those skilled in the art will appreciate
15 the relationship between antisense oligonucleotide gapmers and SSOs. Gapmers are ASON
   that contain an RNAse H activating region (typically a 2'-deoxyribonucleoside
   phosphorothioate) which is flanked by non-activating nuclease resistant oligomers. In
   general, any chemistry suitable for the flanking sequences in a gapmer ASON can be used in
   an SSO.
20 The SSOs of this invention may be made through the well-known technique of solid phase
   synthesis. Any other means for such synthesis known in the art may additionally or
   alternatively be used. It is well known to use similar techniques to prepare oligonucleotides
   such as the phosphorothioates and alkylated derivatives.
   The bases of the SSO may be the conventional cytosine, guanine, adenine and uracil or
25 thymidine. Alternatively, modified bases can be used. Of particular interest are modified
   bases that increase binding affinity. One non-limiting example of preferred modified bases
   are the so-called g-clamp or 9-(aminoethoxy)phenoxazine nucleotides, cytosine analogues
   that form 4 hydrogen bonds with guanosine. (Flanagan, W.M., et al., 1999, proc. Natl. Acad.
   Sci. 96:3513; Holmes, S.C., 2003, Nucleic Acids Res. 31:2759). Specific examples of other
30 bases include, but are not limited to, 5-methylcytosine (meC,  isocytosine, pseudoisocytosine,
   5-bromouracil, 5-propynyluracil, 5-propyny-6, 5-methylthiazoleuracil, 6-aminopurine, 2
   aminopurine, inosine, 2,6-diaminopurine, 7-propyne-7-deazaadenine, 7-propyne-7
   deazaguanine and 2-chloro-6-aminopurine.
   When LNA nucleotides are employed in an SSO it is preferred that non-LNA nucleotides also
35 be present. LNA nucleotides have such high affinities of hybridization that there can be
   significant non-specific binding, which may reduce the effective concentration of the free
   SSO. When LNA nucleotides are used they may be alternated conveniently with 2'-

     WO 2008/131807                                     18                      PCT/EP2007/061211
   deoxynucleotides. Alternating nucleotides, alternating dinucleotides or mixed patterns, e.g.,
   LDLDLD or LLDLLD or LDDLDD can be used. For example in one embodiment, contains a
   sequence of nucleotides selected from the group consisting of: LDLDDLLDDLDLDLL,
   LDLDLLLDDLLLDLL, LMLMMLLMMLMLMLL, LMLMLLLMMLLLMLL, LFLFFLLFFLFLFLL,
 5 LFLFLLLFFLLLFLL, LDDLDDLDDL, DLDDLDDLDD, DDLDDLDDLD, LMMLMMLMML,
   MLMMLMMLMM, MMLMMLMMLM, LFFLFFLFFL, FLFFLFFLFF, FFLFFLFFLF, DLDLDLDLDL,
   LDLDLDLDL, MLMLMLMLML, LMLMLMLML, FLFLFLFLFL, LFLFLFLFL, where L is a LNA unit, D is
   a DNA unit, M is 2'Moe, F is 2'fluoro.
   When 2'-deoxynucleotides or 2'-deoxynucleoside phosphorothioates are mixed with LNA
10 nucleotides it is important to avoid RNAse H activation. It is expected that between about
   one third and two thirds of the LNA nucleotides of an SSO will be suitable. When affinity
   enhancing modifications are used, including but not limited to LNA or g-clamp nucleotides,
   the skilled person recognizes it can be necessary to increase the proportion of such affinity
   enhancing modifications.
15 Numerous alternative chemistries which do not activate RNAse H are available. For example,
   suitable SSOs can be oligonucleotides wherein at least one of the internucleotide bridging
   phosphate residues is a modified phosphate, such as methyl phosphonate, methyl
   phosphonothioate, phosphoromorpholidate, phosphoropiperazidate, and phosphoroamidate.
   For example, every other one of the internucleotide bridging phosphate residues may be
20 modified as described. In another non-limiting example, such SSO are oligonucleotides
   wherein at least one of the nucleotides contains a 2' lower alkyl moiety (e.g., c1-c4 , linear or
   branched, saturated or unsaturated alkyl, such as methyl, ethyl, ethenyl, propyl, 1-propenyl,
   2-propenyl, and isopropyl). For example, every other one of the nucleotides may be
   modified as described. (see references in u.s. pat. 5,976,879 col. 4). For in vivo use,
25 phosphorothioate linkages are preferred.
   The length of the SSO will be from about 8 to about 30 bases in length. Those skilled in the
   art appreciate that when affinity-increasing chemical modifications are used, the SSO can be
   shorter and still retain specificity. Those skilled in the art will further appreciate that an
   upper limit on the size of the SSO is imposed by the need to maintain specific recognition of
30 the target sequence, and to avoid secondary-structure forming self hybridization of the SSO
   and by the limitations of gaining cell entry. These limitations imply that an SSO of increasing
   length (above and beyond a certain length which will depend on the affinity of the SSO) will
   be more frequently found to be less specific, inactive or poorly active.
   SSOs of the invention include, but are not limited to, modifications of the SSO involving
35 chemically linking to the SSO one or more moieties or conjugates which enhance the activity,
   cellular distribution or cellular uptake of the SSO. Such moieties include, but are not limited
   to, lipid moieties such as a cholesterol moiety, cholic acid, a thioether, e.g. Hexyl-s-tritylthiol,

     WO 2008/131807                                     19                     PCT/EP2007/061211
   a thiocholesterol, an aliphatic chain, e.g., dodecandiol or undecyl residues, a phospholipids,
   e.g., di-hexadecyl-rac-glycerol or triethylammonium 1,2-di-o-hexadecyl-rac-glycero-3-h
   phosphonate, a polyamine or a polyethylene glycol chain, an adamantane acetic acid, a
   palmityl moiety, an octadecylamine or hexylamino-carbonyl-oxycholesterol moiety.
 5 It is not necessary for all positions in a given SSO to be uniformly modified, and in fact more
   than one of the aforementioned modifications may be incorporated in a single compound or
   even at a single nucleoside within an SSO.
   The SSOs may be admixed, encapsulated, conjugated, or otherwise associated with other
   molecules, molecule structures, or mixtures of compounds, as for example liposomes,
10 receptor targeted molecules, oral, rectal, topical or other formulation, for assisting in uptake,
   distribution, and/or absorption.
   Those skilled in the art appreciate that cellular differentiation includes, but is not limited to,
   differentiation of the spliceosome. Accordingly, the activity of any particular SSO can depend
   upon the cell type into which they are introduced. For example, SSOs which are effective in
15 one cell type may be ineffective in another cell type.
   The methods, oligonucleotides, and formulations of the present invention are also useful as in
   vitro or in vivo tools to examine splicing in human or animal genes. Such methods can be
   carried out by the procedures described herein, or modifications thereof which will be
   apparent to skilled persons.
20 The SSOs disclosed herein can be used to treat any condition in which the medical
   practitioner intends to limit the effect of tnf or the signalling pathway activated by tnf. In
   particular, the invention can be used to treat an inflammatory disease. In one embodiment,
   the condition is an inflammatory systemic disease, e.g., rheumatoid arthritis or psoriatic
   arthritis. In another embodiment, the disease is an inflammatory liver disease. Examples of
25 inflammatory liver diseases include, but are not limited to, hepatitis associated with the
   hepatitis a, b, or c viruses, alcoholic liver disease, and non-alcoholic steatosis. In yet another
   embodiment, the inflammatory disease is a skin condition such as psoriasis.
   RNAseH Recruitment
   The oligomer according to the invention does not mediate RNAseH based cleavage of a
30 complementary single stranded RNA molecule. A stretch of at least 5 consecutive DNA
   nucleobases are required for an oligonucleotide to be effective in recruitment of RNAseH.
   EP 1 222 309 provides in vitro methods for determining RNaseH activity, which may be used
   to determine the ability to recruit RNaseH. A compound is deemed capable of recruiting
   RNase H if, when provided with the complementary RNA target, it has an initial rate, as

     WO 2008/131807                                   20                    PCT/EP2007/061211
   measured in pmol/l/min, of at least 1 %, such as at least 5%, such as at least 10% or less
   than 20% of the equivalent DNA only oligonucleotide, with no 2' substitutions, with
   phosphorothiote linkage groups between all nucleotides in the oligonucleotide, using the
   methodology provided by Example 91 - 95 of EP 1 222 309.
 5 A compound is deemed essentially incapable of recruiting RNaseH if, when provided with the
   complementary RNA target, and RNaseH, the RNaseH initial rate, as measured in pmol/l/min,
   is less than 20% such as less than 10% such as less than 5%, or preferably less than 1%,
   (or even less than 0.1%) of the initial rate determined using the equivalent DNA only
   oligonucleotide, with no 2' substitutions, with phosphorothiote linkage groups between all
10 nucleotides in the oligonucleotide, using the methodology provided by Example 91 - 95 of EP
    1 222 309.
   Nucleotide Analogues
   It will be recognised that when referring to a preferred nucleotide sequence motif or
   nucleotide sequence, which consists of only nucleotides, the oligomers of the invention which
15 are defined by that sequence may comprise a corresponding nucleotide analogues in place of
   one or more of the nucleotides present in said sequence, such as LNA units or other
   nucleotide analogues, which raise the duplex stability/Tm of the oligomer/target duplex (i.e.
   affinity enhancing nucleotide analogues).
   Furthermore, the nucleotide analogues may enhance the stability of the oligomer in vivo.
20 In one embodiment, the nucleotide analogues (X) are independently selected form the group
   consisting of: 2'-O-alkyl-RNA unit, 2'-OMe-RNA unit, 2' MOE RNA unit, 2'-amino-DNA unit,
   2'-fluoro-DNA unit, LNA unit, PNA unit, HNA unit, INA unit.
   In one embodiment, the contiguous nucleobases sequence does not comprise 2'OMe
   ribonucleotide analogues or 2'-MOE ribonucleotide analogues. .
25 In one embodiment the nucleotide analogue is 2'-MOE, i.e. 2'O-2methoxyethyl RNA.
   Therefore in one embodiment X 2 or M as referred to in nucleobases motifsherein may be 2'
   MOE.
   Incorporation of affinity-enhancing nucleotide analogues in the oligomer, such as LNA or 2'
   substituted sugars, can allow the size of the specifically binding oligomer to be reduced, and
30 may also reduce the upper limit to the size of the oligomer before non-specific or aberrant
   binding takes place.

     WO 2008/131807                                      21                   PCT/EP2007/061211
   Suitably, when the nucleobase sequence of the oligomer, or the contiguous nucleobase
   sequence, is not fully complementary to the corresponding region of the TNFR target
   sequence, in one embodiment, when the oligomer comprises affinity enhancing nucleotide
   analogues, such nucleotide analogues form a complement with their corresponding nucleotide
 5 in the TNFR target.
   The oligomer may thus comprise or consist of a simple sequence of natural nucleotides
   preferably 2'-deoxynucleotides (referred to here generally as "DNA"), but also possibly
   ribonucleotides (referred to here generally as "RNA") - or it could comprise one or more (and
   possibly consist completely of) nucleotide "analogues".
10 Nucleotide "analogues" are variants of natural DNA or RNA nucleotides by virtue of
   modifications in the sugar and/or base and/or phosphate portions. The term "nucleobase"
   will be used to encompass natural (DNA- or RNA-type) nucleotides as well as such
   "analogues" thereof. Analogues could in principle be merely "silent" or "equivalent" to the
   natural nucleotides in the context of the oligonucleotide, i.e. have no functional effect on the
15 way the oligonucleotide works to inhibit beta-catenin expression. Such "equivalent"
   analogues may nevertheless be useful if, for example, they are easier or cheaper to
   manufacture, or are more stable to storage or manufacturing conditions, or represent a tag
   or label. Preferably, however, the analogues will have a functional effect on the way in which
   the oligomer works to inhibit expression; for example by producing increased binding affinity
20 to the target and/or increased resistance to intracellular nucleases and/or increased ease of
   transport into the cell.
   Examples of such modification of the nucleotide include modifying the sugar moiety to
   provide a 2'-substituent group or to produce a bridged (locked nucleic acid) structure which
   enhances binding affinity and probably also provides some increased nuclease resistance;
25 modifying the internucleotide linkage from its normal phosphodiester to one that is more
   resistant to nuclease attack, such as phosphorothioate or boranophosphate.
   A preferred nucleotide analogue is LNA, such as beta-D-oxy-LNA, alpha-L-oxy-LNA, beta-D
   amino-LNA and beta-D-thio-LNA, most preferred beta-D-oxy-LNA.
   In some embodiments, the oligomer comprises from 3-8 nucleotide analogues, e.g. 6 or 7
30 nucleotide analogues. In the by far most preferred embodiments, at least one of said
   nucleotide analogues is a locked nucleic acid (LNA); for example at least 3 or at least 4, or at
   least 5, or at least 6, or at least 7, or 8, of the nucleotide analogues may be LNA. In some
   embodiments all the nucleotides analogues may be LNA.
   In some embodiments the nucleotide analogues present within the oligomer of the invention
35 are independently selected from, for example: 2'-O-alkyl-RNA units, 2'-amino-DNA units, 2'-

     WO 2008/131807                                    22                    PCT/EP2007/061211
   fluoro-DNA units, LNA units, arabino nucleic acid (ANA) units, 2'-fluoro-ANA units, HNA units,
   INA (intercalating nucleic acid) units and 2'MOE units.
   2'-O-methoxyethyl-RNA (2'MOE), 2'-fluoro-DNA monomers and LNA are preferred nucleotide
   analogues, and as such the oligonucleotide of the invention may comprise nucleotide
 5 analogues which are independently selected from these three types of analogue, or may
   comprise only one type of analogue selected from the three types.
   Preferably, the oligomer according to the invention comprises at least one Locked Nucleic
   Acid (LNA) unit, such as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 LNA units, preferably between 4 to 8 LNA
   units, most preferably 4, 5 or 6 LNA units. Suitably, the oligomer may comprise both beta-D
10 oxy-LNA, and one or more of the following LNA units: thio-LNA, amino-LNA, oxy-LNA, ena
   LNA and/or alpha-LNA in either the D-beta or L-alpha configurations or combinations thereof.
   In one embodiment of the invention, the oligomer may comprise both LNA and DNA units.
   Preferably the combined total of LNA and DNA units is 8 - 24, such as 8 - 15 or 10-25, or
   10-20, or 12-16.
15 In one embodiment of the invention, the nucleobase sequence of the oligomer, such as the
   contiguous nucleobase sequence consists of at least one LNA and the remaining nucleobase
   units are DNA units.
   In some embodiments of oligomer according to the invention, such as an antisense
   oligonucleotide which comprises LNA, all LNA C units are 5'methyl-Cytosine. In some
20 embodiments, all the nucleotide analogues are LNA.
   In most preferred embodiments the oligomer comprises only LNA nucleotide analogues and
   nucleotides (RNA or DNA, most preferably DNA nucleotides, optionally with modified
   internucleobase linkages such as phosphorothioate).
   In some embodiments at least one of said nucleotide analogues is 2'-MOE-RNA, such as 2, 3,
25 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8 2'-MOE-RNA nucleobase units.
   In some embodiments at least one of said nucleotide analogues is 2'-fluoro DNA, such as 2,
   3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8 2'-fluoro-DNA nucleobase units.

   The term "LNA" refers to a bicyclic nucleotide analogue, known as "Locked Nucleic Acid". It
   may refer to an LNA monomer, or, when used in the context of an "LNA oligonucleotide"
 5 refers to an oligonucleotide containing one or more such bicyclic nucleotide analogues.
   A particularly preferred chemistry is provided by locked nucleic acids (LNA) (Koshkin, A.A., et
   al., 1998, Tetrahedron 54:3607; Obika, S., et al., 1998, Tetrahedron Lett. 39:5401). As
   used herein, the terms "LNA unit", "LNA monomer", "LNA residue", "locked nucleic acid unit",
   "locked nucleic acid monomer" or "locked nucleic acid residue", refer to a bicyclic nucleoside

   High affintiy nucleotide analogues are nucleotide analogues which result in oligonucleotide
   which has a higher thermal duplex stability with a complementary RNA nucleotide than the
   binding affinity of an equivalent DNA nucleotide. This is typically determined by measuring
25 the Tm.
   Nucleotide analogues which increase the Tm of the oligomer/target nucleic acid target, as
   compared to the equivalent nucleotide are preferred (affinity enhancing nucleotide
   analogues). The oligomers may suitably be capable of hybridising against the target nucleic
   acid, such as a TNFR mRNA, to form a duplex with a Tm of at least 30 0 C, such as 37 0 C, such
30 as at least 40 0 C, at least 50 0 C, at least 55 0 C, or at least 60 0 C. In one aspect, for example,
   the Tm is between 30 0 C and 80 0 C, such as between 40 0 C and 70 0 C.

   TNFR1 (SEQ ID No: 118) which includes the signal sequence or 30-208 of wild type human
   TNFR1 for mature huTNFR1 A7 which lacks the signal sequence, and in either case is followed
   immediately by amino acids 247-455 of wild type human TNFR1.
   In another preferred embodiment, the mammalian TNFR is a mammalian TNFR2, most
35 preferably a human TNFR2. For human TNFR2 two non-limiting examples of this

     WO 2008/131807                                   36                     PCT/EP2007/061211
   embodiment are given by huTNFR2 A7 which includes the signal sequence as shown in SEQ
   ID No: 126 or mature huTNFR2 A7 (amino acids 23-435 of SEQ ID No: 126) which lacks the
   signal sequence. The sequences of these huTNFR2 A7 proteins are either amino acids 1-262
   of wild type human TNFR2 (SEQ ID No: 120) which includes the signal sequence or 23-262 of
 5 wild type human TNFR2 for mature huTNFR2 A7 which lacks the signal sequence, followed in
   either case by the amino acid glutamate, because of the creation of a unique codon at the
   exon 6-8 junction, which is followed by amino acids 290-461 of wild type human TNFR2.
   The proteins of the present invention also include those proteins that are chemically
   modified. Chemical modification of a protein refers to a protein where at least one of its
10 amino acid residues is modified by either natural processes, such as processing or other post
   translational modifications, or by chemical modification techniques known in the art. Such
   modifications include, but are not limited to, acetylation, acylation, amidation, ADP
   ribosylation, glycosylation, methylation, pegylation, prenylation, phosphorylation, or
   cholesterol conjugation.
15 The proteins of the present invention may, in one embodiment, also include variants,
   fragments and homolgoues of the proteins of the invention. However, such proteins
   comprise a deletion in the amino acid sequence which is encoded by exon 7 or exon 8, as
   explained herein.
   Nucleic Acids
20 The invention further provides a nucleic acid encoding the soluble form of TNFalpha receptor
   according to the invention.
   In one embodiment, the nucleic acid is selected from the group consisting of: nucleotides 1
   1251 of SEQ ID NO 121, 88-1251 of SEQ ID NO 121, 1-1305 of SEQ ID NO 125 and 67-1305
   of SEQ ID NO 125, or variant, homologue or fragment thereof, including a nucleic acid which
25 encodes the same primary amino acid sequence as the nucleic acid, i.e. due to the
   degeneracy of the genetic code.
   One embodiment of the present invention is a nucleic acid that encodes a protein, either full
   length or mature, which is encoded by a cDNA derived from a mammalian TNFR gene, and in
   the cDNA exon 6 is followed directly by exon 8 and as a result lacks exon 7.
30 Such sequences are preferably provided in the form of an open reading frame uninterrupted
   by internal nontranslated sequences, or introns, which are typically present in eukaryotic
   genes. Genomic DNA containing the relevant sequences can also be used. In one
   embodiment, the nucleic acid is either an mRNA or a cDNA. In another embodiment, it is
   genomic DNA.

     WO 2008/131807                                   37                       PCT/EP2007/061211
   In one embodiment, the mammalian TNFR is a mammalian TNFR1.            For this embodiment, the
   mammalian TNFR1 is preferably a human TNFR1. For human TNFR1, two non-limiting
   examples of this embodiment are nucleic acids which encode the huTNFR1 A7 which includes
   the signal sequence as shown in SEQ ID No: 122 and mature huTNFR1 A7 (amino acids 30

   signal sequence and nucleotides 88-1251 of SEQ ID No: 121 which lacks the signal sequence.
   The sequences of these huTNFR1 A7 nucleic acids are either nucleotides 1-625 of wild type
   human TNFR1 (SEQ ID No: 117) which includes the signal sequence or 88-625 of wild type
10 human TNFR1 for mature huTNFR2 A7 which lacks the signal sequence, and in either case is
   followed immediately by amino acids 740-1368 of wild type human TNFR1.
   In another preferred embodiment, the mammalian TNFR is a mammalian TNFR2, most
   preferably a human TNFR2. For human TNFR2, two non-limiting examples of this
   embodiment are nucleic acids which encode the huTNFR2 A7 which includes the signal
15 sequence as shown in SEQ ID No: 126 or mature huTNFR2 A7 (amino acids 23-435 of SEQ
   ID No: 126) which lacks the signal sequence. Preferably, the sequences of these huTNFR2
   A7 nucleic acids are nucleotides 1-1305 of SEQ ID No: 115 which includes the signal
   sequence and nucleotides 67-1305 of SEQ ID No: 115 which lacks the signal sequence. The
   sequences of these huTNFR2 A7 nucleic acids are either nucleotides 1-787 of wild type
20 human TNFR2 (SEQ ID No: 119) which includes the signal sequence or 67-787 of wild type
   human TNFR2 for mature huTNFR2 A7 which lacks the signal sequence, and in either case is
   followed immediately by amino acids 866-1386 of wild type human TNFR2.
   The bases of the nucleic acids of the present invention can be the conventional bases
   cytosine, guanine, adenine and uracil or thymidine. Alternatively, modified bases can be
25 used. Other suitable bases include, but are not limited to, 5-methylcytosine      (MeC),
   isocytosine, pseudoisocytosine, 5-bromouracil, 5-propynyluracil, 5-propyny-6, 5
   methylthiazoleuracil, 6-aminopurine, 2-aminopurine, inosine, 2,6-diaminopurine, 7-propyne

   (aminoethoxy)phenoxazine.
30 Suitable nucleic acids of the present invention include numerous alternative chemistries. For
   example, suitable nucleic acids of the present invention include, but are not limited to, those
   wherein at least one of the internucleotide bridging phosphate residues is a modified
   phosphate, such as phosphorothioate, methyl phosphonate, methyl phosphonothioate,
   phosphoromorpholidate, phosphoropiperazidate, and phosphoroamidate. In another non
35 limiting example, suitable nucleic acids of the present invention include those wherein at
   least one of the nucleotides contain a 2' lower alkyl moiety (e.g., C1-C 4 , linear or branched,
   saturated or unsaturated alkyl, such as methyl, ethyl, ethenyl, propyl, 1-propenyl, 2
   propenyl, and isopropyl).

   Nucleic acids of the present invention also include, but are not limited to, those wherein at
   least one, of the nucleotides is a nucleic acid analogue. Examples of such analogues include,
   but are not limited to, hexitol (HNA) nucleotides, 2'O-4'C-linked bicyclic ribofuranosyl (LNA)
   nucleotides, peptide nucleic acid (PNA) analogues, N3'->P5' phosphoramidate analogues,
 5 phosphorodiamidate morpholino nucleotide analogues, and combinations thereof.
   Nucleic acids of the present invention include, but are not limited to, modifications of the
   nucleic acids involving chemically linking to the nucleic acids one or more moieties or
   conjugates. Such moieties include, but are not limited to, lipid moieties such as a cholesterol
   moiety, cholic acid, a thioether, e.g. hexyl-S-tritylthiol, a thiocholesterol, an aliphatic chain,
10 e.g., dodecandiol or undecyl residues, a phospholipids, e.g., di-hexadecyl-rac-glycerol or
   triethylammonium 1,2-di-0-hexadecyl-rac-glycero-3-H-phosphonate, a polyamine or a
   polyethylene glycol chain, an adamantane acetic acid, a palmityl moiety, an octadecylamine
   or hexylamino-carbonyl-oxycholesterol moiety.
   Expression Vectors and Host Cells
15 The invention also provides for a vector comprising the nucleic acid of the invention.
   In one embodiment, the vector comprises an expression cassette capable of driving the
   expression of said nucleic acid in a host cell.
   The invention also provides for a host cell comprising the nucleic acid or the vector according
   to the invention.
20 The invention also provides for a method for the preparation of a soluble form of TNFalpha
   receptor, said method comprising the step of culturing the host cell according to the
   invention under conditions which allow the expression of said nucleic acid, and subsequently
   isolating said soluble form of TNFalpha receptor from said host cells.
   The present invention provides expression vectors to amplify or express DNA encoding
25 mammalian TNFR of the current invention. The present invention also provides host cells
   transformed with the foregoing expression vectors. Expression vectors are replicable DNA
   constructs which have synthetic or cDNA-derived DNA fragments encoding mammalian TNFR
   or bioequivalent analogues operably linked to suitable transcriptional or translational
   regulatory elements derived from mammalian, microbial, viral, or insect genes. A
30 transcriptional unit generally comprises an assembly of (a) a genetic element or elements
   having a regulatory role in gene expression, such as, transcriptional promoters or enhancers,
   (b) a structural or coding sequence which is transcribed into mRNA and translated into
   protein, and (c) appropriate transcription and translation initiation and termination
   sequences. Such regulatory elements can include an operator sequence to control
35 transcription, and a sequence encoding suitable mRNA ribosomal binding sites. The ability to

     WO 2008/131807                                   39                      PCT/EP2007/061211
   replicate in a host, usually conferred by an origin of replication, and a selection gene to
   facilitate recognition of transformants, can additionally be incorporated.
   DNA regions are operably linked when they are functionally related to each other. For
   example, DNA for a signal peptide (secretory leader) is operably linked to DNA for a
 5 polypeptide if it is expressed as a precursor which participates in the secretion of the
   polypeptide; a promoter is operably linked to a coding sequence if it controls the transcription
   of the sequence; or a ribosome binding site is operably linked to a coding sequence if it is
   positioned so as to permit translation. Generally, operably linked means contiguous and, in
   the case of secretory leaders, contiguous and in reading frame. Structural elements intended
10 for use in yeast expression systems preferably include a leader sequence enabling
   extracellular secretion of translated protein by a host cell. Alternatively, where recombinant
   protein is expressed without a leader or transport sequence, it may include an N-terminal
   methionine residue. This residue may optionally be subsequently cleaved from the expressed
   protein to provide a final product.
15 Mammalian TNFR DNA is expressed or amplified in a recombinant expression system
   comprising a substantially homogeneous monoculture of suitable host microorganisms, for
   example, bacteria such as E. coli or yeast such as S. cerevisiae, which have stably integrated
   (by transformation or transfection) a recombinant transcriptional unit into chromosomal DNA
   or carry the recombinant transcriptional unit as a component of a resident plasmid.
20 Recombinant expression systems as defined herein will express heterologous protein either
   constitutively or upon induction of the regulatory elements linked to the DNA sequence or
   synthetic gene to be expressed.
   Transformed host cells are cells which have been transformed or transfected with mammalian
   TNFR vectors constructed using recombinant DNA techniques. Transformed host cells
25 ordinarily express TNFR, but host cells transformed for purposes of cloning or amplifying
   TNFR DNA do not need to express TNFR. Suitable host cells for expression of mammalian
   TNFR include prokaryotes, yeast, fungi, or higher eukaryotic cells. Prokaryotes include gram
   negative or gram positive organisms, for example E. coli or bacilli. Higher eukaryotic cells
   include, but are not limited to, established insect and mammalian cell lines. Cell-free
30 translation systems can also be employed to produce mammalian TNFR using RNAs derived
   from the DNA constructs of the present invention. Appropriate cloning and expression
   vectors for use with bacterial, fungal, yeast, and mammalian cellular hosts are well known in
   the art.
   Prokaryotic expression hosts may be used for expression of TNFR that do not require
35 extensive proteolytic and disulfide processing. Prokaryotic expression vectors generally
   comprise one or more phenotypic selectable markers, for example a gene encoding proteins
   conferring antibiotic resistance or supplying an autotrophic requirement, and an origin of

     WO 2008/131807                                    40                      PCT/EP2007/061211
   replication recognized by the host to ensure amplification within the host. Suitable
   prokaryotic hosts for transformation include E. coli, Bacillus subtilis, Salmonella typhimurium,
   and various species within the genera Pseudomonas, Streptomyces, and Staphyolococcus,
   although others can also be employed as a matter of choice.
 5 Useful expression vectors for bacterial use can comprise a selectable marker and bacterial
   origin of replication derived from commercially available plasmids comprising genetic
   elements of the well known cloning vector pBR322 (ATCC 37017). These pBR322 "backbone"
   sections are combined with an appropriate promoter and the structural sequence to be
   expressed. pBR322 contains genes for ampicillin and tetracycline resistance and thus
10 provides simple means for identifying transformed cells. Such commercial vectors include,
   for example, the series of Novagen® pET vectors (EMD Biosciences, Inc., Madison, Wis.).
   Promoters commonly used in recombinant microbial expression vectors include the lactose
   promoter system, and the X PL promoter, the T7 promoter, and the T7 lac promoter. A
   particularly useful bacterial expression system, Novagen® pET system (EMD Biosciences,
15 Inc., Madison, Wis.) employs a T7 or T7 lac promoter and E. coli strain, such as BL21(DE3)
   which contain a chromosomal copy of the T7 RNA polymerase gene.
   TNFR proteins can also be expressed in yeast and fungal hosts, preferably from the genus
   Saccharomyces, such as S. cerevisiae. Yeast of other genera, such as Pichia or
   Kluyveromyces can also be employed. Yeast vectors will generally contain an origin of
                          2
20 replication from the     p yeast plasmid or an autonomously replicating sequence (ARS),
   promoter, DNA encoding TNFR, sequences for polyadenylation and transcription termination
   and a selection gene. Preferably, yeast vectors will include an origin of replication and
   selectable marker permitting transformation of both yeast and E. coli, e.g., the ampicillin
   resistance gene of E. coli and S. cerevisiae TRP1 or URA3 gene, which provides a selection
25 marker for a mutant strain of yeast lacking the ability to grow in tryptophan or uracil,
   respectively, and a promoter derived from a highly expressed yeast gene to induce
   transcription of a structural sequence downstream. The presence of the TRP1 or URA3 lesion
   in the yeast host cell genome then provides an effective environment for detecting
   transformation by growth in the absence of tryptophan or uracil, respectively.
30 Suitable promoter sequences in yeast vectors include the promoters for metallothionein, 3
   phosphoglycerate kinase or other glycolytic enzymes , such as enolase, glyceraldehyde-3
   phosphate dehydrogenase, hexokinase, pyruvate decarboxylase, phosphofructokinase,
   glucose-6-phosphate isomerase, 3-phosphoglycerate mutase, pyruvate kinase,
   triosephosphate isomerase, phosphoglucose isomerase, and glucokinase. Suitable vectors
35 and promoters for use in yeast expression are well known in the art.

     WO 2008/131807                                   41                       PCT/EP2007/061211
   Preferred yeast vectors can be assembled using DNA sequences from pUC18 for selection and
   replication in E. coli (Amp' gene and origin of replication) and yeast DNA sequences including
   a glucose-repressible ADH2 promoter and a-factor secretion leader. The yeast a-factor
   leader, which directs secretion of heterologous proteins, can be inserted between the
 5 promoter and the structural gene to be expressed. The leader sequence can be modified to
   contain, near its 3' end, one or more useful restriction sites to facilitate fusion of the leader
   sequence to foreign genes. Suitable yeast transformation protocols are known to those of
   skill in the art.
   Host strains transformed by vectors comprising the ADH2 promoter may be grown for
10 expression in a rich medium consisting of 1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 1% or 4%
   glucose supplemented with 80 mg/ml adenine and 80 mg/ml uracil. Derepression of the
   ADH2 promoter occurs upon exhaustion of medium glucose. Crude yeast supernatants are
   harvested by filtration and held at 40C. prior to further purification.
   Various mammalian or insect cell culture systems are also advantageously employed to
15 express TNFR protein. Expression of recombinant proteins in mammalian cells is particularly
   preferred because such proteins are generally correctly folded, appropriately modified and
   completely functional. Examples of suitable mammalian host cell lines include the COS-7
   lines of monkey kidney cells, and other cell lines capable of expressing an appropriate vector
   including, for example, L cells, such as L929, C127, 3T3, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO), HeLa
20 and BHK cell lines. Mammalian expression vectors can comprise nontranscribed elements
   such as an origin of replication, a suitable promoter, for example, the CMVie promoter, the
   chicken beta-actin promoter, or the composite hEF1-HTLV promoter, and enhancer linked to
   the gene to be expressed, and other 5' or 3' flanking nontranscribed sequences, and 5' or 3'
   nontranslated sequences, such as necessary ribosome binding sites, a polyadenylation site,
25 splice donor and acceptor sites, and transcriptional termination sequences. Baculovirus
   systems for production of heterologous proteins in insect cells are known to those of skill in
   the art.
   The transcriptional and translational control sequences in expression vectors to be used in
   transforming vertebrate cells can be provided by viral sources. For example, commonly used
30 promoters and enhancers are derived from Polyoma, Adenovirus 2, Simian Virus 40 (SV40),
   human cytomegalovirus, such as the CMVie promoter, HTLV, such as the composite hEF1
   HTLV promoter. DNA sequences derived from the SV40 viral genome, for example, SV40
   origin, early and late promoter, enhancer, splice, and polyadenylation sites can be used to
   provide the other genetic elements required for expression of a heterologous DNA sequence.
35 Further, mammalian genomic TNFR promoter, such as control and/or signal sequences can be
   utilized, provided such control sequences are compatible with the host cell chosen.

      WO 2008/131807                                   42                     PCT/EP2007/061211
   In preferred aspects of the present invention, recombinant expression vectors comprising
   TNFR cDNAs are stably integrated into a host cell's DNA.
   Protein Expression and Purification:
   When mammalian or insect cells are used, properly expressed TNFR protein will be secreted
 5 into the extracellular media. The protein is recovered from the media, and is concentrated
   and is purified using standard biochemical techniques. After expression in mammalian cells
   by lentiviral or AAV transduction, plasmid transfection, or any similar procedure, or in insect
   cells after baculoviral transduction, the extracellular media of these cells is concentrated
   using concentration filters with an appropriate molecular weight cutoff, such as Amicon®
10 filtration units. To avoid loss of TNFR protein, the filter should allow proteins to flow through
   that are at or below 50 kDal.
   When TNFR protein is expressed in bacterial culture it can be purified by standard
   biochemical techniques. Bacteria are lysed, and the cellular extract containing the TNFR is
   desalted and is concentrated.
15 In either case, the TNFR protein is preferably purified by affinity chromatography. The use of
   column chromatography with an affinity matrix comprising TNF-a is preferred. Alternatively,
   an affinity purification tag can be added to either the N- or the C-terminus of the TNFR
   protein. For example, a polyhistidine-tag (His-tag), which is an amino acid motif with at least
   six histidines, can be used for this purpose (Hengen, P., 1995, Trends Biochem. Sci. 20:285
20 86). The addition of a His-tag can be achieved by the in-frame addition of a nucleotide
   sequence encoding the His-tag directly to either the 5' or 3' end of the TNFR open reading
   frame in an expression vector. One such nucleotide sequence for the addition of a C-terminal
   His-tag is given in SEQ ID No: 126. When a His-tag is incorporated into the protein, a nickel
   or cobalt affinity column is employed to purify the tagged TNFR, and the His-tag can
25 optionally then be cleaved. Other suitable affinity purification tags and methods of
   purification of proteins with those tags are well known in the art.
   Alternatively, a non-affinity based purification scheme can be used, involving fractionation of
   the TNFR extracts on a series of columns that separate the protein based on size (size
   exclusion chromatography), charge (anion and cation exchange chromatography) and
30 hydrophobicity (reverse phase chromatography). High performance liquid chromatography
   can be used to facilitate these steps.
   Other methods for the expression and purification of TNFR proteins are well known (See,
   e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,605,690 to Jacobs).

   Definitions
   The term "internucleoside linkage group" is intended to mean a group capable of covalently
   coupling together two nucleobases, such as between DNA units, between DNA units and
   nucleotide analogues, between two non-LNA units, between a non-LNA unit and an LNA unit,
 5 and between two LNA units, etc. Preferred examples include phosphate, phpshodiester
   groups and phosphorothioate groups.
   Herein, the term "nitrogenous base" is intended to cover purines and pyrimidines, such as
   the DNA nucleobases A, C, T and G, the RNA nucleobases A, C, U and G, as well as non
10 DNA/RNA nucleobases, such as 5-methylcytosine       (MeC), isocytosine, pseudoisocytosine, 5
   bromouracil, 5-propynyluracil, 5-propyny-6-fluoroluracil, 5-methylthiazoleuracil, 6
   aminopurine, 2-aminopurine, inosine, 2,6-diaminopurine, 7-propyne-7-deazaadenine, 7
   propyne-7-deazaguanine and 2-chloro-6-aminopurine, in particular       MeC.  It will be understood
   that the actual selection of the non-DNA/RNA nucleobase will depend on the corresponding
15 (or matching) nucleotide present in the microRNA strand which the oligonucleotide is
   intended to target. For example, in case the corresponding nucleotide is G it will normally be
   necessary to select a non-DNA/RNA nucleobase which is capable of establishing hydrogen
   bonds to G. In this specific case, where the corresponding nucleotide is G, a typical example
   of a preferred non-DNA/RNA nucleobase is MeC.
20
   As used herein, the terms "tumor necrosis factor receptor", "TNF receptor", and "TNFR" refer
   to proteins having amino acid sequences of or which are substantially similar to native
   mammalian TNF receptor sequences, and which are capable of binding TNF molecules. In
   this context, a "native" receptor or gene for such a receptor, means a receptor or gene that
25 occurs in nature, as well as the naturally-occurring allelic variations of such receptors and
   genes.
   The term "mature" as used in connection with a TNFR means a protein expressed in a form
   lacking a leader or signal sequence as may be present in full-length transcripts of a native
   gene.
30 The nomenclature for TNFR proteins as used herein follows the convention of naming the
   protein (e.g., TNFR2) preceded by a species designation, e.g., hu (for human) or mu (for
   murine), followed by a A (to designate a deletion) and the number of the exon(s) deleted.
   For example, huTNFR2 A7 refers to human TNFR2 lacking exon 7. In the absence of any
   species designation, TNFR refers generically to mammalian TNFR.
35 The term "secreted" means that the protein is soluble, i.e., that it is not bound to the cell
   membrane. In this context, a form will be soluble if using conventional assays known to one

     WO 2008/131807                                     44                      PCT/EP2007/061211
   of skill in the art most of this form can be detected in fractions that are not associated with
   the membrane, e.g., in cellular supernatants or serum.
   The term "stable" means that the secreted TNFR form is detectable using conventional assays
   by one of skill in the art, such as, western blots, ELISA assays in harvested cells, cellular
 5 supernatants, or serum.
   As used herein, the terms "tumor necrosis factor" and "TNF" refer to the naturally-occuring
   protein ligands that bind to TNF receptors. TNF includes, but is not limited to, TNF-a and
   TNF-.
   As used herein, the term "an inflammatory disease or condition" refers to a disease, disorder,
10 or other medical condition that at least in part results from or is aggravated by the binding of
   TNF to its receptor. Such diseases or conditions include, but are not limited to, those
   associated with increased levels of TNF, increased levels of TNF receptor, or increased
   sensitization or deregulation of the corresponding signaling pathway. The term also
   encompasses diseases and conditions for which known TNF antagonists have been shown
15 useful. Examples of inflammatory diseases or conditions include, but are not limited to,
   rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing
   spondylitis, inflammatory bowel disease (including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis),
   hepatitis, sepsis, alcoholic liver disease, and non-alcoholic steatosis.
   As used herein, the term "hepatitis" refers to a gastroenterological disease, condition, or
20 disorder that is characterized, at least in part, by inflammation of the liver. Examples of
   hepatitis include, but are not limited to, hepatitis associated with hepatitis A virus, hepatitis B
   virus, hepatitis C virus, or liver inflammation associated with ischemia/reperfusion.
   As used herein, the term "TNF antagonist" means that the protein is capable of measurable
   inhibition of TNF-mediated cytotoxicity using standard assays as are well known in the art .
25 (See, e.g L929 cytotoxicity assay as described in the Examples below).
   The term "binds TNF" means that the protein can bind detectable levels of TNF, preferably
   TNF-a, as measured by standard binding assays as are well known in the art (See, e.g., U.S.
   Pat. No. 5,945,397 to Smith, cols. 16-17). Preferably, receptors of the present invention are
   capable of binding greater than 0.1 nmoles TNF-a/nmole receptor, and more preferably,
30 greater than 0.5 nmoles TNF-a/nmole receptor using standard binding assays.
   As used herein, the term "regulatory element" refers to a nucleotide sequence involved in an
   interaction of molecules that contributes to the functional regulation of a nucleic acid,
   including but not limited to, replication, duplication, transcription, splicing, translation, or
   degradation of the nucleic acid. The regulation may be enhancing or inhibitory in nature.
35 Regulatory elements known in the art include, for example, transcriptional regulatory

     WO 2008/131807                                   45                       PCT/EP2007/061211
   sequences such as promoters and enhancers. A promoter is a DNA region that is capable
   under certain conditions of aiding the initiation of transcription of a coding region usually
   located downstream (in the 3' direction) from the promoter. An expression vector typically
   comprises such regulatory elements operably linked to the nucleic acid of the invention.
 5 The terms "oligomer" and "splice switching oligomer" and "oligonucleotide" are used
   interchangeably herein.
   As used herein, the term "operably linked" refers to a juxtaposition of genetic elements,
   wherein the elements are in a relationship permitting them to operate in the expected
   manner. For example, a promoter is operably linked to a coding region if the promoter helps
10 initiate transcription of the coding sequence (such as in an expression vector). As long as
   this functional relationship is maintained, there can be intervening residues between the
   promoter and the coding region.
   As used herein, the terms "transformation" or "transfection" refer to the insertion of an
   exogenous nucleic acid into a cell, irrespective of the method used for the insertion, for
15 example, lipofection, transduction, infection or electroporation. The exogenous nucleic acid
   can be maintained as a non-integrated vector, for example, a plasmid, or alternatively, can
   be integrated into the cell's genome.
   As used herein, the term "vector" refers to a nucleic acid molecule capable of transporting
   another nucleic acid to which it has been linked. One type of vector is a "plasmid", which
20 refers to a circular double stranded DNA loop into which additional DNA segments can be
   ligated. Another type of vector is a viral vector, wherein additional DNA segments can be
   ligated into the viral genome. Certain vectors are capable of autonomous replication in a
   host cell into which they are introduced (e.g., bacterial vectors having a bacterial origin of
   replication and episomal mammalian vectors). Other vectors (e.g., non-episomal mammalian
25 vectors) are integrated into the genome of a host cell upon introduction into the host cell,
   and thereby are replicated along with the host genome. Moreover, certain vectors,
   expression vectors, are capable of directing the expression of genes to which they are
   operably linked. In general, expression vectors of utility in recombinant DNA techniques are
   often in the form of plasmids. or viral vectors (e.g., replication defective retroviruses,
30 adenoviruses and adeno-associated viruses).
   As used herein, the term "isolated protein" refers to a protein or polypeptide that is not
   naturally-occurring and/or is separated from one or more components that are naturally
   associated with it.
   As used herein, the term "isolated nucleic acid" refers to a nucleic acid that is not naturally
35 occurring and/or is in the form of a separate fragment or as a component of a larger

     WO 2008/131807                                    46                     PCT/EP2007/061211
   construct, which has been derived from a nucleic acid isolated at least once in substantially
   pure form, i.e., free of contaminating endogenous materials, and in a quantity or
   concentration enabling identification and manipulation by standard biochemical methods, for
   example, using a cloning vector.
 5 As used herein the term "purified protein" refers to a protein that is present in the substantial
   absence of other protein. However, such purified proteins can contain other proteins added
   as stabilizers, carriers, excipients, or co-therapeutics. The term "purified" as used herein
   preferably means at least 50% such as at least 80% by dry weight, more preferably in the
   range of 95-99% by weight, and most preferably at least 99.8% by weight, of protein
10 present, excluding proteins added as stabilizers, carriers, excipients, or co-therapeutics.
   As used herein, the term "altering the splicing of a pre-mRNA" refers to altering the splicing
   of a cellular pre-mRNA target resulting in an altered ratio of splice products. Such an
   alteration of splicing can be detected by a variety of techniques well known to one of skill in
   the art. For example, RT-PCR on total cellular RNA can be used to detect the ratio of splice
15 products in the presence and the absence of an SSO.
   As used herein, the term "complementary" is used to indicate a sufficient degree of
   complementarity or precise pairing such that stable and specific binding occurs between an
   oligonucleotide and a DNA or RNA containing the target sequence. It is understood in the art
   that the sequence of an oligonucleotide need not be 100% complementary to that of its
20 target. For example, for an SSO there is a sufficient degree of complementarity when, under
   conditions which permit splicing, binding to the target will occur and non-specific binding will
   be avoided." However, it is preferred that the oligonucloeitde or contiguous nucleobase
   sequence is fully (i.e. perfectly) complementary to the target sequence (such as the region of
   SEQ ID NO 1 - 4, refered to herein).
25 The terms "corresponding to" and "corresponds to" as used in the context of oligonucleotides
   refers to the comparison between either a nucleobase sequence of the compound of the
   invention, and the reverse complement thereof, or in one embodiment between a nucleobase
   sequence and an equivalent (identical) nucleobase sequence which may for example
   comprise other nucleobases but retains the same base sequence, or complement thereof.
30 Nucleotide analogues are compared directly to their equivalent or corresponding natural
   nucleotides. Sequences which form the reverse complement of a sequence are referred to as
   the complement sequence of the sequence.
   When referring to the length of a nucleotide molecule as referred to herein, the length
35 corresponds to the number of monomer units, i.e. nucleobases, irrespective as to whether
   those monomer units are nucleotides or nucleotide analogues. With respect to nucleobases,
   the terms monomer and unit are used interchangeably herein.

     WO 2008/131807                                  47                     PCT/EP2007/061211
   It should be understood that when the term "about" is used in the context of specific values
   or ranges of values, the disclosure should be read as to include the specific value or range
   referred to.
 5
   The term "variant" as used in herein in the context of a protein or polypeptide (sequence),
   refers to a polypeptide which is prepared from the original (parent) polypeptide, or using the
   sequence information from the polypeptide, by insertion, deletion or substitution of one or
   more amino acids in said sequence, i.e. at least one amino acids, but preferably less than 50
10 amino acids, such as less than 40, less than 30, less than 20, or less than 10 amino acids,
   such as 1 amino acid, 1-2 amino acids, 1-3 amino acids, 1-4 amino acids, 1-5 amino acids.
   The term "homologue" as used herein in the context of a protein or polypeptide (sequence),
   refers to a polypeptide which is at least 70% homologous, such as at least 80% homologous,
   such as at least 85% homologous, or at least 90% homologous, such as at least 95%, 96%,
15 97%, 98% or 99% homologous to said polypeptide sequence. Homology between two
   polypeptide sequences may be determined using ClustalW alignment algorithm using the
   Blosum 62 algorithm, with Gap Extent = 0.5, Gap open = 10 (see
   http://www.ebi.ac.uk/emboss/aian/index.html). The alignment may, in one embodiment be
   a local alignment (water) or a separate embodiment be a global alignment (needle).      As the
20 homolgoues of the exon deletion TNFR proteins referred to herein also comprise deletion in
   the respective exon, a global alignment may be preferred.
   The term "fragment" as used herein in the context of a protein or polypeptide (sequence),
   refers to a polypeptide which consists of only a part of the polypeptide sequence. A fragment
   may therefore comprise at least 5% such as at least 10% of said polypeptide sequence,
25 including at least 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90% or 95% of said polypeptide
   sequence.
   The above definitions of variant, fragment and homologue also apply to nucleic acid
   sequences, although the homology algorithm used is DNAfull. Obviously, when referring to
   nucleic acid variant, fragment or homologue, the terms protein, polypeptide and amino acid
30 should be replaced with nucleic acid, polynucleotide or nucleobase/nucleotide accordingly.
   As used herein, the terms "membrane bound form" or "integral membrane form" refer to
   proteins having amino acid sequences that span a cell membrane, with amino acid sequences
   on each side of the membrane.
   As used herein, the term "stable, secreted, ligand-binding form" or as it is sometimes known
35 "stable, soluble, ligand-binding form." (where the terms "secreted" and "soluble" are
   synonymous and interchangeable herein) refer to proteins that are related to the native

     WO 2008/131807                                    48                      PCT/EP2007/061211
   membrane bound form receptors, in such a way that they are secreted and stable and still
   capable of binding to the corresponding ligand. It should be noted that these forms are not
   defined by whether or not such secreted forms are physiological, only that the products of
   such splice variants would be secreted, stable, and still capable of ligand-binding when
 5 produced.
   The term "secreted" means that the form is soluble, i.e., that it is no longer bound to the cell
   membrane. In this context, a form will be soluble if using conventional assays known to one
   of skill in the art most of this form can be detected in fractions that are not associated with
   the membrane, e.g., in cellular supernatants or serum.
10 The term "stable" means that the secreted form is detectable using conventional assays by
   one of skill in the art. For example, western blots, ELISA assays can be used to detect the
   form from harvested cells, cellular supernatants, or serum from patients.
   The term "ligand-binding" means that the form retains at least some significant level,
   although not necessarily all, of the specific ligand-binding activity of the corresponding
15 integral membrane form.
   As used herein, the term "to reduce the activity of a ligand" refers to any action that leads to
   a decrease in transmission of an intracellular signal resulting from the ligand binding to or
   interaction with the receptor. For example, activity can be reduced by binding of the ligand to
   a soluble form of its receptor or by decreasing the quantity of the membrane form of its
20 receptor available to bind the ligand.
   Pharmaceutical Compositions and Preparations
   Other embodiments of the invention are pharmaceutical compositions comprising the
   oligomers, proteins and nucleic acids according to the invention.
   The oligomers, nucleic acids and proteins of the present invention may be admixed,

   nebulizer, intratracheal, and intranasal delivery). The formulations may conveniently be
   presented in unit dosage form and may be prepared by any of the methods well known in the
   art. The most suitable route of administration in any given case may depend upon the
   subject, the nature and severity of the condition being treated, and the particular active
 5 compound which is being used.
   Pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention include, but are not limited to,
   physiologically and pharmaceutically acceptable salts, i.e., salts that retain the desired
   biological activity of the parent compound and do not impart undesired toxicological
   properties. Examples of such salts are (a) salts formed with cations such as sodium,
10 potassium, NH4 ', magnesium, calcium, polyamines such as spermine and spermidine, etc.;
   (b) acid addition salts formed with inorganic acids, for example, hydrochloric acid,
   hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, nitric acid and the like; and (c) salts formed

   The present invention provides for the use of the oligomers, proteins and nucleic acids as set
   forth above for the preparation of a medicament for treating a patient afflicted with an
20 inflammatory disorder involving excessive activity of TNF, as discussed below. In the
   manufacture of a medicament according to the invention, the oligomers, nucleic acids and
   proteins of the present invention are typically admixed with, inter alia, an acceptable carrier.
   The carrier must, of course, be acceptable in the sense of being compatible with other
   ingredients in the formulation and must not be deleterious to the patient. The carrier may be
25 a solid or liquid. Oligomers, nucleic acids and proteins of the present invention are
   incorporated in formulations, which may be prepared by any of the well known techniques of
   pharmacy consisting essentially of admixing the components, optionally including one or
   more accessory therapeutic ingredients.
   Formulations of the present invention may comprise sterile aqueous and non-aqueous
30 injection solutions of the active compounds, which preparations are preferably isotonic with
   the blood of the intended recipient and essentially pyrogen free. These preparations may
   contain anti-oxidants, buffers, bacteriostats, and solutes which render the formulation
   isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient. Aqueous and non-aqueous sterile
   suspensions can include, but are not limited to, suspending agents and thickening agents.
35 The formulations may be presented in unit dose or multi-dose containers, for example,
   sealed ampoules and vials, and may be stored in freeze-dried (lyophilized) condition requiring
   only the addition of the sterile liquid carrier, for example, saline or water-for-injection
   immediately prior to use.

   In the formulation the oligomers, nucleic acids and proteins of the present invention may be
   contained within a particle or vesicle, such as a liposome or microcrystal, which may be
   suitable for parenteral administration. The particles may be of any suitable structure, such
   as unilamellar or plurilameller, so long as the oloigomers, nucleic acids and proteins of the
 5 present invention are contained therein. Positively charged lipids such as N-[1-(2,3
   dioleoyloxy)propyl]-N,N,N-trimethyl-ammoniummethylsulfate, or "DOTAP," are particularly
   preferred for such particles and vesicles. The preparation of such lipid particles is well known
   (See references in U.S. Pat. No. 5,976,879 col. 6).
   Accordingly one embodiment of the invention is a method of treating an inflammatory
10 disease or condition by administering a stable, secreted, ligand-binding form of a TNF
   receptor, thereby decreasing the activity of TNF for the receptor. In another embodiment,
   the invention is a method of treating an inflammatory disease or condition by administering
   an oligonucleotide that encodes a stable, secreted, ligand-binding form of a TNF receptor,
   thereby decreasing the activity of TNF for the receptor. In another embodiment, the
15 invention is a method of producing a stable, secreted, ligand-binding form of a TNF receptor.
   The following aspects of the present invention discussed below apply to the foregoing
   embodiments.
   The methods, nucleic acids, proteins, and formulations of the present invention are also
   useful as in vitro or in vivo tools.
20 Embodiments of the invention can be used to treat any condition in which the medical
   practitioner intends to limit the effect of TNF or a signalling pathway activated by it. In
   particular, the invention can be used to treat an inflammatory disease. In one embodiment,
   the condition is an inflammatory systemic disease, e.g., rheumatoid arthritis or psoriatic
   arthritis. In another embodiment, the disease is an inflammatory liver disease. Examples of
25 inflammatory liver diseases include, but are not limited to, hepatitis associated with the
   hepatitis A, B, or C viruses, alcoholic liver disease, and non-alcoholic steatosis. In yet
   another embodiment, the inflammatory disease is a skin condition such as psoriasis.
   The uses of the present invention include, but are not limited to, treatment of diseases for
   which known TNF antagonists have been shown useful. Three specific TNF antagonists are
30 currently FDA-approved. The drugs are etanercept (Enbrel@), infliximab (Remicade®) and
   adalimumab (Humira®). One or more of these drugs is approved for the treatment of
   rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing
   spondylitis, and inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis).

     WO 2008/131807                                   51                     PCT/EP2007/061211
   Use of proteins for the treatment of inflammatory diseases:
   Accordingly one embodiment of the invention is a method of treating an inflammatory
   disease or condition by administering SSOs to a patient, The SSOs that are administered
   alter the splicing of a pre-mRNA to produce a splice variant that encodes a stable, secreted,
 5 ligand-binding form of a receptor of the TNFR superfamily, thereby decreasing the activity of
   the ligand for that receptor. In another embodiment, the invention is a method of producing
   a stable, secreted, ligand-binding form of a receptor of the TNFR superfamily in a cell by
   administering SSOs to the cell.
   For therapeutic use, purified TNFR proteins of the present invention are administered to a
10 patient, preferably a human, for treating TNF-dependent inflammatory diseases, such as
   arthritis. In the treatment of humans, the use of huTNFRs is preferred. The TNFR proteins of
   the present invention can be administered by bolus injection, continuous infusion, sustained
   release from implants, or other suitable techniques. Typically, TNFR therapeutic proteins will
   be administered in the form of a composition comprising purified protein in conjunction with
15 physiologically acceptable carriers, excipients or diluents. Such carriers will be nontoxic to
   recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed. Ordinarily, the preparation of such
   compositions entails combining the TNFR with buffers, antioxidants such as ascorbic acid,
   polypeptides, proteins, amino acids, carbohydrates including glucose, sucrose or dextrins,
   chelating agents such as EDTA, glutathione and other stabilizers and excipients. Neutral
20 buffered saline or saline mixed with conspecific serum albumin are exemplary appropriate
   diluents. Preferably, product is formulated as a lyophilizate using appropriate excipient
   solutions, for example, sucrose, as diluents. Preservatives, such as benzyl alcohol may also
   be added. The amount and frequency of administration will depend of course, on such
   factors as the nature and the severity of the indication being treated, the desired response,
25 the condition of the patient and so forth.
   TNFR proteins of the present invention are administered systemically in therapeutically
   effective amounts preferably ranging from about 0.1 mg/kg/week to about 100 mg/kg/week.
   In preferred embodiments, TNFR is administered in amounts ranging from about 0.5
   mg/kg/week to about 50 mg/kg/week. For local administration, dosages preferably range
30 from about 0.01 mg/kg to about 1.0 mg/kg per injection.
   Use of expression vectors to increase the levels of a TNF antagonist in a mammal
   The present invention provides a process of increasing the levels of a TNF antagonist in a
   mammal. The process includes the step of transforming cells of the mammal with an
   expression vector described herein, which drives expression of a TNFR as described herein.

     WO 2008/131807                                    52                     PCT/EP2007/061211
   The process is particularly useful in large mammals such as domestic pets, those used for
   food production, and primates. Exemplary large mammals are dogs, cats, horses cows,
   sheep, deer, and pigs. Exemplary primates are monkeys, apes, and humans.
   The mammalian cells can be transformed either in vivo or ex vivo. When transformed in
 5 vivo, the expression vector are administered directly to the mammal, such as by injection.
   Means for transforming cells in vivo are well known in the art. When transformed ex vivo,
   cells are removed from the mammal, transformed ex vivo, and the transformed cells are
   reimplanted into the mammal.
   The uses of the present invention include, but are not limited to, treatment of diseases for
10 which known TNF antagonists have been shown useful. Three specific TNF antagonists are
   currently FDA-approved. The drugs are etanercept (Enbrel@), infliximab (Remicade®) and
   adalimumab (Humira®). One or more of these drugs is approved for the treatment of
   rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing
   spondylitis, and inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis).
15 The administration of the SSO to subjects can be accomplished using procedures developed
   for ASON. ASON have been successfully administered to experimental animals and human
   subjects by intravenous administration in saline in doses as high as 6 mg/kg three times a
   week (Yacysyhn, B.R., et al., 2002, Gut 51:30 (anti-ICAM-1 ASON for treatment of Crohn's
   disease); Stevenson, J., et al., 1999, J. Clinical Oncology 17:2227 (anti-RAF-1 ASON
20 targeted to PBMC)).     The pharmacokinetics of 2'O-MOE phosphorothioate ASON, directed
   towards TNF-a has been reported (Geary, R.S., et al., 2003, Drug Metabolism and Disposition
   31:1419). The systemic efficacy of mixed LNA/DNA molecules has also been reported
   (Fluiter, K., et al., 2003, Nucleic Acids Res. 31:953).
   The systemic activity of SSO in a mouse model system was investigated using 2'O-MOE
25 phosphorothioates and PNA chemistries. Significant activity was observed in all tissues
   investigated except brain, stomach and dermis (Sazani, P., et al., 2002, Nature
   Biotechnology 20, 1228).
   In general any method of administration that is useful in conventional antisense treatments
   can be used to administer the SSO of the invention. For testing of the SSO in cultured cells,
30 any of the techniques that have been developed to test ASON or SSO may be used.
   Formulations of the present invention comprise SSOs in a physiologically or pharmaceutically
   acceptable carrier, such as an aqueous carrier. Thus formulations for use in the present
   invention include, but are not limited to, those suitable for parenteral administration including
   intraperitoneal, intraarticular, intravenous, intraarterial, subcutaneous, or intramuscular
35 injection or infusion, as well as those suitable for topical, ophthalmic, vaginal, oral, rectal or

   pulmonary (including inhalation or insufflation of powders or aerosols, including by nebulizer,
   intratracheal, intranasal delivery) administration. The formulations may conveniently be
   presented in unit dosage form and may be prepared by any of the methods well known in the
   art. The most suitable route of administration in any given case may depend upon the
 5 subject, the nature and severity of the condition being treated, and the particular active
   compound which is being used.
   Pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention include, but are not limited to,
   physiologically and pharmaceutically acceptable salts ,i.e, salts that retain the desired
   biological activity of the parent compound and do not impart undesired toxicological
10 properties. Examples of such salts are (a) salts formed with cations such as sodium,
   potassium, NH4 , magnesium, calcium, polyamines such as spermine and spermidine, etc.;
   (b) acid addition salts formed with inorganic acids, for example, hydrochloric acid,
   hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, nitric acid and the like; and (c) salts formed
   with organic acids such as, for example, acetic acid, oxalic acid, tartaric acid, succinic acid,

   methanesulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, napthalenedisulfonic acid, polygalacturonic acid,
   and the like.
   The present invention provides for the use of SSOs having the characteristics set forth above
20 for the preparation of a medicament for increasing the ratio of a mammalian TNFR2 protein
   that lacks exon 7 to its corresponding membrane bound form, in a patient afflicted with an
   inflammatory disorder involving TNF-a, as discussed above. In the manufacture of a
   medicament according to the invention, the SSOs are typically admixed with, inter alia, an
   acceptable carrier. The carrier must, of course, be acceptable in the sense of being
25 compatible with any other ingredients in the formulation and must not be deleterious to the
   patient. The carrier may be a solid or liquid. SSOs are incorporated in the formulations of
   the invention, which may be prepared by any of the well known techniques of pharmacy
   consisting essentially of admixing the components, optionally including one or more
   accessory therapeutic ingredients.
30 Formulations of the present invention may comprise sterile aqueous and non-aqueous
   injection solutions of the active compounds, which preparations are preferably isotonic with
   the blood of the intended recipient and essentially pyrogen free. These preparations may
   contain anti-oxidants, buffers, bacteriostats, and solutes which render the formulation
   isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient. Aqueous and non-aqueous sterile
35 suspensions can include, but are not limited to, suspending agents and thickening agents.
   The formulations may be presented in unit dose or multi-dose containers, for example,
   sealed ampoules and vials, and may be stored in freeze-dried (lyophilized) condition requiring

   only the addition of the sterile liquid carrier, for example, saline or water-for-injection
   immediately prior to use.
   In the formulation the SSOs may be contained within a particle or vesicle, such as a
   liposome, or microcrystal, which may be suitable for parenteral administration. The particles
 5 may be of any suitable structure, such as unilamellar or plurilameller, so long as the SSOs
   are contained therein. Positively charged lipids such as N-[1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)propyl]-N,N,N
   trimethyl-ammoniummethylsulfate, or "DOTAP," are particularly preferred for such particles
   and vesicles. The preparation of such lipid particles is well known.       [See references in U.S.

10 The SSO can be targeted to any element or combination of elements that regulate splicing,
   including the 3'splice site, the 5' splice site, the branch point, the polypyrimidine tract, exonic
   splicing ehancers, exonic splicing silencers, intronic splicing enhancers, and intronic splicing
   silencers.
   Those skilled in the art can appreciate that the invention as directed toward human TNFR2
15 can be practiced using SSO having a sequence that is complementary to at least 8, to at least
   9, to at least 10, to at least 11, to at least 12, to at least 13, to at least 14, to at least 15,
   preferably between 10 and 16 nucleotides of the portions of the TNFR1 or TNFR2 gene
   comprising exons 7 and its adjacent introns.
   SEQ ID No: 3 contains the sequence of exon 7 of TNFR2 and 50 adjacent nucleotides of the
20 flanking introns. For example, SSO targeted to human TNFR2 can have a nucleobase
   sequence selected from the sequences listed in Table 4. When affinity-enhancing
   modifications are used, including but not limited to LNA or G-clamp nucleotides, the skilled
   person recognizes the length of the SSO can be correspondingly reduced.
   Those skilled in the art will also recognize that the selection of SSO sequences must be made
25 with care to avoid a self-complementary SSO, which may lead to the formation of partial
   "hairpin" duplex structures. In addition, high GC content should be avoided to minimize the
   possibility of non-specific base pairing. Furthermore, SSOs matching off-target genes, as
   revealed for example by BLAST, should also be avoided.
   In some situations, it may be preferred to select an SSO sequence that can target a human
30 and at least one other species. These SSOs can be used to test and to optimize the invention
   in said other species before being used in humans, thereby being useful for regulatory
   approval and drug development purposes. For example, SSOs with sequences selected from
   SEQ ID Nos: 14, 30, 46, 70 and 71 which target human TNFR2 are also 100%
   complementary to the corresponding Macaca Mullata sequences. As a result these sequences
35 can be used to test treatments in monkeys, before being used in humans.

     WO 2008/131807                                   55                      PCT/EP2007/061211
   The following aspects of the present invention discussed below apply to the foregoing
   embodiments.
   The length of the SSO is similar to an antisense oligonucleotide (ASON), typically between
   about 10 and 24 nucleotides. The invention can be practiced with SSOs of several chemistries
 5 that hybridize to RNA, but that do not activate the destruction of the RNA by RNase H, as do
   conventional antisense 2r-deoxy oligonucleotides. The invention can be practiced using 2'O
   modified nucleic acid oligomers, such as 2'O-methyl or 2'O- methyloxyethyl
   phosphorothioate. The nucleobases do not need to be linked to sugars; so- called peptide
   nucleic acid oligomers or morpholine-based oligomers can be used. A comparison of these
10 different linking chemistries is found in Sazani, P. et al, 2001, Nucleic Acids Res. 29:3695.
   The term splice-switching oligonucleotide is intended to cover the above forms. Those skilled
   in the art will appreciate the relationship between antisense oligonucleotide gapmers and
   SSOs. Gapmers are ASON that contain an RNase H activating region (typically a 2'
   deoxyribonucleoside phosphorothioate) which is flanked by non- activating nuclease resistant
15 oligomers. In general, any chemistry suitable for the flanking sequences in a gapmer ASON
   can be used in an SSO.
   The SSOs of this invention may be made through the well-known technique of solid phase
   synthesis. Any other means for such synthesis known in the art may additionally or
   alternatively be used. It is well known to use similar techniques to prepare oligonucleotides
20 such as the phosphorothioates and alkylated derivatives.
   A particularly preferred chemistry is provided by locked nucleic acids (LNA) (Koshkin, A. A.,
   et al., 1998, Tetrahedron 54:3607; Obika, S., et al., 1998, Tetrahedron Lett. 39:5401). LNA
   are conventional phosphodiester-linked ribonucleotides, except the ribofuranosyl moiety is
   made bicyclic by a bridge between the 2'O and the 41C. This bridge constrains the
25 conformation of ribofuranosyl ring into the conformation, the V-endo conformation, which is
   adopted when a oligonucleotide hybridizes to a complementary RNA. Recent advances in the
   synthesis of LNA are described in WO 03/095467. The bridge is most typically a methylene or
   an ethylene. The synthesis of 2'0,4'C-ethylene-bridged nucleic acids (ENA), as well as other
   LNA, is described in Morita, et al., 2003, Bioorg. and Med. Chem. 11:2211. However,
30 alternative chemistries can be used and the 2'O may be replaced by a 2'N. LNA and
   conventional nucleotides can be mixed to form a chimeric SSO. For example, chimeric SSO of
   alternating LNA and 2'deoxynucleotides or alternating LNA and 2'O-Me or 2'O-MOE can be
   employed. An alternative to any of these chemistries, not merely the 2'-deoxynucleotides, is
   a phosphorothioatediester linkage replacing phosphodiester. For in vivo use,
35 phosphorothioate linkages are preferred.
   When LNA nucleotides are employed in an SSO it is preferred that non-LNA nucleotides also
   be present. LNA nucleotides have such high affinities of hybridization that there can be

     WO 2008/131807                                    56                     PCT/EP2007/061211
   significant non-specific binding, which may reduce the effective concentration of the free
   SSO. When LNA nucleotides are used they may be alternated conveniently with 2'
   deoxynucleotides. Alternating nucleotides, alternating dinucleotides or mixed patterns, e.g.,
   LDLDLD or LLDLLD or LDDLDD can be used, When 2'-deoxynucleotides or 2'-deoxynucleoside
 5 phosphorothioates are mixed with LNA nucleotides it is important to avoid RNase H
   activation. It is expected that between about one third and two thirds of the LNA nucleotides
   of an SSO will be suitable. For example if the SSO is a 12-mer, then at least four LNA
   nucleotides and four conventional nucleotides will be present.
   The bases of the SSO may be the conventional cytosine, guanine, adenine and uracil or
10 thymidine. Alternatively modified bases can also be used. Of particular interest are modified
   bases that increase binding affinity. One non-limiting example of preferred modified bases
   are the so-called G-clamp or 9-(aminoethoxy)phenoxazine nucleotides, cytosine analogs that
   form 4 hydrogen bonds with guanosine. (Flanagan, W.M., et al., 1999, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.
   96:3513; Holmes, S.C., 2003, Nucleic Acids Res. 31:2759).
15 Numerous alternative chemistries which do not activate RNase H are available. For example,
   suitable SSOs may be oligonucleotides wherein at least one, or all, of the internucleotide
   bridging phosphate residues are modified phosphates, such as methyl phosphonates, methyl
   phosphonothioates, phosphoromorpholidates, phosphoropiperazidates, and
   phosphoroamidates. For example, every other one of the internucleotide bridging phosphate
20 residues may be modified as described. In another non-limiting example, such SSO are
   oligonucleotides wherein at least one, or all, of the nucleotides contain a 2' loweralkyl moiety
   (e.g., C1-C4, linear or branched, saturated or unsaturated alkyl, such as methyl, ethyl,
   ethenyl, propyl, 1-propenyl, 2-propenyl, and isopropyl). For example, every other one of the
   nucleotides may be modified as described. [See references in U.S. Pat. 5,976,879 col. 4].
25 The length of the SSO (i.e. the number of monomers in the oligomer) will be from about 10
   to about 30 bases in length. In one embodiment, 20 bases of 2'O-Me-ribonucleosides
   phosphorothioates are effective. Those skilled in the art appreciate that when affinity
   increasing chemical modifications are used, the SSO can be shorter and still retain specificity.
   Those skilled in the art will further appreciate that an upper limit on the size of the SSO is
30 imposed by the need to maintain specific recognition of the target sequence, and to avoid
   secondary-structure forming self hybridization of the SSO and by the limitations of gaining
   cell entry. These limitations imply that an SSO of increasing length (above and beyond a
   certain length which will depend on the affinity of the SSO) will be more frequently found to
   be less specific, inactive or poorly active.
35 SSOs of the invention include, but are not limited to, modifications of the SSO involving
   chemically linking to the SSO one or more moieties or conjugates which enhance the activity,
   cellular distribution or cellular uptake of the SSO. Such moieties include, but are not limited

     WO 2008/131807                                      57                    PCT/EP2007/061211
   to, lipid moieties such as a cholesterol moiety, cholic acid, a thioether, e.g. hexyl- S
   tritylthiol, a thiocholesterol, an aliphatic chain, e.g., dodecandiol or undecyl residues, a
   phospholipids, e.g., di-hexadecyl-rac-glycerol or triethylammonium 1,2-di-0-hexadecyl-rac
   glycero-3-H-phosphonate, a polyamine or a polyethylene glycol chain, an adamantane acetic
 5 acid, a palmityl moiety, an octadecylamine or hexylamino-carbonyl-oxycholesterol moiety.
   It is not necessary for all positions in a given SSO to be uniformly modified, and in fact more
   than one of the aforementioned modifications may be incorporated in a single compound or
   even at a single nucleoside within an SSO.
   The SSOs may be admixed, encapsulated, conjugated, or otherwise associated with other
10 molecules, molecule structures, or mixtures of compounds, as for example liposomes,
   receptor targeted molecules, oral, rectal, topical or other formulation, for assisting in uptake,
   distribution, and/or absorption.
   Those skilled in the art appreciate that cellular differentiation includes, but is not limited to,
   differentiation of the spliceosome. Accordingly, the activity of any particular SSO of the
15 invention can depend upon the cell type into which they are introduced. For example, SSOs
   which are effective in cell type may be ineffective in another cell type.
   The methods, oligonucleotides, and formulations of the present invention are also useful as in
   vitro or in vivo tools to examine splicing in human or animal genes. Such methods can be
   carried out by the procedures described herein, or modifications thereof which will be
20 apparent to skilled persons.
   The invention can be used to treat any condition in which the medical practitioner intends to
   limit the effect of a TNF superfamily ligand or the signalling pathway activated by such
   ligand. In particular, the invention can be used to treat an inflammatory disease. In one
   embodiment, the condition is an inflammatory systemic disease, e.g., rheumatoid arthritis or
25 psoriatic arthritis. In another embodiment, the disease is an inflammatory liver disease.
   Examples of inflammatory liver diseases include, but are not limited to, hepatitis associated
   with the hepatitis A, B, or C viruses, alcoholic liver disease, and non-alcoholic steatosis. In
   yet another embodiment, the inflammatory disease is a skin condition such as psoriasis.
   The uses of the present invention include, but are not limited to, treatment of diseases for
30 which known TNF antagonists have been shown useful. Three specific TNF antagonists are
   currently FDA-approved. The drugs are etanercept (Enbrel@), infliximab (Remicade®) and
   adalimumab (Humira®). One or more of these drugs is approved for the treatment of
   rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing
   spondylitis, and inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis).

   In a preferred embodiment, the receptor is either the TNFR1 or TNFR2 receptors. In other
   embodiments, the receptor is a member of the TNFR superfamily that is sufficiently
   homologous to TNFR1 and TNFR2, e.g., TNFRSF3, TNFRSF5, or TNFRSFI IA, so that deletion
   of either or both exons homologous to exons 7 and 8 results in a secreted form. Those skilled
 5 in the art appreciate that the operability of the invention is not determined by whether or not
   such secreted forms are physiological, only that the products of such splice variants are
   secreted, stable, and capable of ligand-binding.
   The administration of the SSO to subjects can be accomplished using procedures developed
   for ASON. ASON have been successfully administered to experimental animals and human
10 subjects by intravenous administration in saline in doses as high as 6 mg/kg three times a
   week (Yacysyhn, B.R., et al, 2002, Gut 51:30 (anti-ICAM-1 ASON for treatment of Crohn's
   disease); Stevenson, J., et al., 1999, J. Clinical Oncology 17:2227 (anti-RAF-1 ASON
   targeted to PBMC)). The pharmacokinetics of 2'0-MOE phosphorothioate ASON, directed
   towards TNF-alpha has been reported (Geary, R.S., et al., 2003, Drug Metabolism and
15 Disposition 31:1419). The systemic efficacy of mixed LNA/DNA molecules has also been
   reported (Fluiter, K., et al., 2003, Nucleic Acids Res. 31:953).
   The systemic activity of SSO in a mouse model system was investigated using 2'0-MOE
   phosphorothioates and PNA chemistries. Significant activity was observed in all tissues
   investigated except brain, stomach and dermis (Sazani, P., et al., 2002, Nature
20 Biotechnology 20, 1228).
   In general any method of administration that is useful in conventional antisense treatments
   can be used to administer the SSO of the invention. For testing of the SSO in cultured cells,
   any of the techniques that have been developed to test ASON or SSO may be used.
   Formulations of the present invention comprise SSOs in a physiologically or pharmaceutically
25 acceptable carrier, such as an aqueous carrier. Thus formulations for use in the present
   invention include, but are not limited to, those suitable for parenteral administration including
   intraperitoneal, intravenous, intraarterial, subcutaneous, or intramuscular injection or
   infusion., as well as those suitable topical (including ophthalmic and to mucous membranes
   including vaginal delivery), oral, rectal or pulmonary (including inhalation or insufflation of
30 powders or aerosols, including by nebulizer, intratracheal, intranasal delivery) administration.
   The formulations may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and may be prepared
   by any of the methods well known in the art. The most suitable route of administration in any
   given case may depend upon the subject, the nature and severity of the condition being
   treated, and the particular active compound which is being used.
35 Pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention include, but are not limited to, the
   physiologically and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof: i.e, salts that retain the desired

     WO 2008/131807                                      59                    PCT/EP2007/061211
   biological activity of the parent compound and do not impart undesired toxicological effects
   thereto. Examples of such salts are (a) salts formed with cations such as sodium, potassium,
   NH4 , magnesium, calcium, polyamines such as spermine and spermidine, etc.; (b) acid
   addition salts formed with inorganic acids, for example, hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid,
 5 sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, nitric acid and the like; (c) salts formed with organic acids such
   as, for example, acetic acid, oxalic acid, tartaric acid, succinic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid,
   gluconic acid, citric acid, malic acid, ascorbic acid, benzoic acid, tannic acid, palmitic acid,
   alginic acid, polyglutamic acid, napthalenesulfonic acid, methanesulfonic acid, p
   toluenesulfonic acid, napthalenedisulfonic acid, polygalacturonic acid, and the like; and (d)
10 salts formed from elemental anions such as chlorine, bromine, and iodine.
   The present invention provides for the use of SSOs having the characteristics set forth above
   for the preparation of a medicament for increasing the ratio of a soluble form of a TNFR
   superfamily member to its corresponding membrane bound form, in a patient afflicted with
   an inflammatory disorder involving excessive activity of a cytokine, such as TNF-a, as
15 discussed above. In the manufacture of a medicament according to the invention, the SSOs
   are typically admixed with, inter alia, an acceptable carrier. The carrier must, of course, be
   acceptable in the sense of being compatible with any other ingredients in the formulation and
   must not be deleterious to the patient. The carrier may be a solid or liquid. SSOs are
   incorporated in the formulations of the invention, which may be prepared by any of the well
20 known techniques of pharmacy consisting essentially of admixing the components, optionally
   including one or more accessory therapeutic ingredients.
   Formulations of the present invention may comprise sterile aqueous and nonaqueous
   injection solutions of the active compounds, which preparations are preferably isotonic with
   the blood of the intended recipient and essentially pyrogen free. These preparations may
25 contain anti-oxidants, buffers, bacteriostats, and solutes which render the formulation
   isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient. Aqueous and non-aqueous sterile
   suspensions can include, but are not limited to, suspending agents and thickening agents.
   The formulations may be presented in unit dose or multi-dose containers, for example,
   sealed ampoules and vials, and may be stored in freeze-dried (lyophilized) condition requiring
30 only the addition of the sterile liquid carrier, for example, saline or water- for-injection
   immediately prior to use.
   In the formulation the SSOs may be contained within a lipid particle or vesicle, such as a
   liposome or microcrystal, which may be suitable for parenteral administration. The particles
   may be of any suitable structure, such as unilamellar or plurilameller, so long as the SSOs
35 are contained therein. Positively charged lipids such as N-[1-(2,3-dioleoyloxi)propyl]- N,N,N
   trimethyl-ammoniummethylsulfate, or "DOTAP," are particularly preferred for such particles

     WO 2008/131807                                      60                     PCT/EP2007/061211
   and vesicles. The preparation of such lipid particles is well known. [See references in U.S.
   Pat. 5,976,879 col. 6]
   The SSO can be targeted to any element or combination of elements that regulate splicing,
   including the 3 'splice site, the 5' splice site, the branch point, the polypyrimidine tract,
 5 exonic splicing ehancers, exonic splicing silencers, intronic splicing enhancers, and intronic
   splicing silencers. The determination of the sequence of the SSO can be guided by the
   following tables that shows the activities of the SSOs whose sequences and locations are
   found as depicted in Figure 20. The person skilled in the art will note that: 1) SSOs
   complementary to the exon need not be complementary to either the splice acceptor or splice
10 donor sites, note SSOs A7-10, B7-7 and B7-9, Table 1; 2) SSOs complementary to
   sequences of the intron and as few as one nucleotide of the exon can be operative, note A8-5
   and B7-6,
   Table 1; 3) SSOs complementary to the intron immediately adjacent to the exon can also be
   effective, note 3312, Table 2; and 4) efficacy of an oligonucleotide alone is usually predictive
15 of the efficacy of the SSO in combination with other SSOs.
   Those skilled in the art can appreciate that the invention as directed toward human TNF
   alpha receptors can be practiced using SSO having a sequence that is complementary to at
   least 10, preferably between 15 and 20 nucleotides of the portions of the TNFR1 or TNFR2
   genes comprising exons 7 or 8 and their adjacent introns. It is further preferred that at least
20 one nucleotide of the exon itself is included within the complementary sequence. SEQ ID
   Nos: 1-4 contain the sequence of Exons 7 and 8 of the TNFR1 (SEQ ID Nos: 1 and 2) and
   TNFR2 (SEQ ID Nos; 3 and 4) and 50 adjacent nucleotides of the flanking introns. When
   affinity-enhancing modifications are used, including but not limited to LNA or G-clamp
   nucleotides, the skilled person recognizes the length of the SSO can be correspondingly
25 reduced. When alternating conventional and LNA nucleotides are used a length of 16 is
   effective.
   Those skilled in the art will also recognize that the selection of SSO sequences must be made
   with care to avoid self-complementary SSO, which may lead to the formation of partial
   "hairpin" duplex structures. In addition, high GC content should be avoided to minimize the
30 possibility of non-specific base pairing. Furthermore, SSOs matching off-target genes, as
   revealed for example by BLAST, should also be avoided.
   In some situations, it may be preferred to select an SSO sequence that can target a human
   and at least one other species. These SSOs can be used to test and to optimize the invention
   in said other species before being used in humans, thereby being useful for regulatory
35 approval and drug development purposes. For example, SEQ ID Nos: 74, 75, 77, 78, 80, and
   89, which target human TNFR2 are also 100% complementary to the corresponding Macaca

   Mullata sequences. As a result these sequences can be used to test treatments in monkeys,
   before being used in humans.
   It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that various omissions, additions and
   modifications may be made to the invention described above without departing from the
 5 scope of the invention, and all such modifications and changes are intended to fall within the
   scope of the invention, as defined by the appended claims. All references, patents, patent
   applications or other documents cited are herein incorporated by reference.

   To analyze the in vitro splice-switching activity of the SSOs listed in Table 7, L929 cells were
   cultured and seeded as described in Example 1. For delivery of each of the SSOs in Table 7
                                                                    TM

   and incubated for 20 minutes. Then 400 mL of serum free media was added to the SSOs and
   applied to the cells in the 24-well plates. The final SSO concentration was either 50 or 100
                                                                      TM
   nM. After 24 hrs, cells were harvested in 800 mL TRI-Reagent          . Total RNA was isolated per
10 the manufacturer's directions and analyzed by RT-PCR (FIG. 3) using the forward primer
   TR045 (SEQ ID No: 228) and the reverse primer TR046 (SEQ ID No: 229).
   To analyze the in vivo splice-switching activity of the SSOs listed in Table 7, mice were
   injected with the SSOs listed in Table 4 intraperitoneal (i.p.) at 25 mg/kg/day for 5 days.
   Mice were bled before injection and again 1, 5 and 10 days after the last injection. The
15 concentration of soluble TNFR2 A7 in the sera taken before the first injection and 10 days
   after the last injection were measured by ELISA (FIG. 4B). The mice were sacrificed on day
   10 and total RNA from 5-10 mg of the liver was analyzed by RT-PCR (FIG. 4A) using the
   forward primer TR045 (SEQ ID No: 228) and the reverse primer TR046 (SEQ ID No: 229).
   Of the 10 nucleotide SSOs subsequences of SSO 3274 tested in vitro, all of them generated
20 at least some muTNFR2 A7 mRNA (FIG. 3). In particular, SSO 3839, 3840 and 3841
   displayed greater splice-switching activity than the longer 16 nucleotide SSO 3274 from
   which they are derived. The three 10 nucleotide SSOs, 3839, 3840, 3841, that demonstrated
   the greatest activity in vitro also were able to generate significant amounts of muTNFR2 A7
   mRNA (FIG. 4A) and soluble muTNFR2 A7 protein (FIG. 4B) in mice in vivo.
25 To assess the effect of SSO length on splice switching activity in human TNFR2, cells were
   treated with SSOs of different lengths. Primary human hepatocytes were transfected with
   the indicated SSOs selected from Table 4. These SSOs were synthesized by Santaris

     WO 2008/131807                                    79                   PCT/EP2007/061211
   Pharma, Denmark with alternating 2'deoxy- and 2'O-4'-(methylene)-bicyclic-ribonucleoside
   phosphorothioates. For each SSO, the 5'-terminal nucleoside was a 2'O-4'-methylene
   ribonucleoside and the 3'-terminal nucleoside was a 2'deoxy-ribonucleoside.These SSOs were
   either 10-, 12-, 14- or 16-mers. The concentration of soluble TNFR2 A7 was measured by
 5 ELISA (FIG. 5, top panel). Total RNA was analyzed by RT-PCR for splice switching activity
   (FIG. 5, bottom panel).
   Example 3 - Analysis of the Splice Junction of SSO-induced TNFR2 Splice Variants
   To confirm that the SSO splice switching, both in mice and in human cells, leads to the
   expected TNFR2 A7 mRNA, SSO-induced TNFR2 A7 mRNA was analyzed by RT-PCR and was
10 sequenced.
   Mice. Mice were injected with SSO 3274 intraperitoneal (i.p.) at 25 mg/kg/day for 10 days.
   The mice were then sacrificed and total RNA from the liver was analyzed by RT-PCR using the
   forward primer TR045 (SEQ ID No: 228) and the reverse primer TR046 (SEQ ID No: 229).
   The products were analyzed on a 1.5% agarose gel (FIG. 6A) and the product for the TNFR2
15 A7 was isolated using standard molecular biology techniques. The isolated TNFR2 A7 product
   was amplified by PCR using the same primers and then sequenced (FIG. 6B). The sequence
   data contained the sequence CTCTCTTCCAATTGAGAAGCCCTCCTGC              (nucleotides 777-804 of
   SEQ ID No: 127), which confirms that the SSO-induced TNFR2 A7 mRNA lacks exon 7 and
   that exon 6 is joined directly to exon 8.
20 Human hepatocytes. Primary human hepatocytes were transfected with SSO 3379 as
   described in Example 1. Total RNA was isolated 48 hrs after transfection. The RNA was
   converted to cDNA with the SuperscriptTM II Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) using random
   hexamer primers according to the manufacturer's directions. PCR was performed on the
   cDNA using the forward primer TR049 (SEQ ID No: 202) and the reverse primer TR050 (SEQ
25 ID No: 203). The products were analyzed on a 1.5% agarose gel (FIG. 7A). The band
   corresponding to TNFR2 A7 was isolated using standard molecular biology techniques and
   then sequenced (FIG. 7B). The sequence data contained the sequence
   CGCTCTTCCAGTTGAGAAGCCCTTGTGC              (nucleotides 774-801 of SEQ ID No: 125), which
   confirms that the SSO-induced TNFR2 A7 mRNA lacks exon 7 and that exon 6 is joined
30 directly to exon 8.
   Example 4 - SSO Dose-Dependent Production of TNFR2 A7 Protein in Primary Human
   Hepatocytes
   The dose response of splice-switching activity of SSOs in primary human hepatocytes was
   tested. Human hepatocytes were obtained in suspension from ADMET technologies. Cells
35 were washed three times and suspended in seeding media (RPMI 1640 supplemented with L-

     WO 2008/131807                                   80                     PCT/EP2007/061211
   Glut, with 10% FBS, penicillin, streptomycin, and 12 nM DexamethASONe). Hepatocytes
   were evaluated for viability and plated in 24-well, collagen-coated plates at 1.0 x 105 cells
   per well. Typically, cell viability was 85-93%. After approximately 24 hrs, the media was
   replaced with maintenance media (seeding media without FBS).
 5 For delivery of each of the SSOs to the hepatocytes, SSOs were diluted into 50 mL of OPTI
        TM
   MEM     , and then 50 mL Lipofectamine TM 2000 mix (1 part Lipofectamine TM 2000 to 25 parts
   OPTI-MEM TM) was added and incubated for 20 minutes. The SSOs were then applied to the
   cells in the 24-well plates. The final SSO concentration ranged from 1 to 150 nM. After 48
   hrs, cells were harvested in 800 mL TRI-Reagent TM.
10 Total RNA from the cells was analyzed by RT-PCR using the forward primer TR047 (SEQ ID
   No: 200) and the reverse primer TR048 (SEQ ID No: 201) (FIG. 8A). The concentration of
   soluble TNFR2 A7 in the serum was measured by ELISA (FIG. 8B). Both huTNFR2 A7 mRNA
   (FIG. 8A) and secreted huTNFR2 A7 protein (FIG. 8B) displayed dose dependent increases.
   Example 5 - Secretion of TNFR2 Splice Variants from Murine Cells
15 The ability of SSOs to induce soluble TNFR2 protein production and secretion into the
   extracellular media was tested. L929 cells were treated with SSOs as described in Example
   1, and extracellular media samples were collected ~48 hrs after transfection. The
   concentration of soluble TNFR2 in the samples was measured by ELISA (FIG. 9). SSOs that
   best induced shifts in RNA splicing, also secreted the most protein into the extracellular
20 media. In particular, SSOs 3305, 3312, and 3274 increased soluble TNFR2 at least 3.5-fold
   over background. Consequently, induction of the splice variant mRNA correlated with
   production and secretion of the soluble TNFR2.
   Example 6 - In Vivo Injection of SSOs Generated muTNFR2 A7 mRNA in Mice
   SSO 3305 in saline was injected intraperitoneal (i.p.) daily for 4 days into mice at doses from
25 3 mg/kg to 25 mg/kg. The mice were sacrificed on day 5 and total RNA from the liver was
   analyzed by RT-PCR. The data show splice switching efficacy similar to that found in cell
   culture. At the maximum dose of 25 mg/kg, SSO 3305 treatment induced almost full
   conversion to A7 mRNA (FIG. 10, bottom panel).
   A similar experiment with SSO 3274 induced about 20% conversion to A7 mRNA. To
30 optimize SSO 3274 induction of A7 mRNA, both the dose regimen and the time from the last
   injection to the sacrifice of the animal were varied. SSO 3274 was injected (i.p.) into mice
   daily for 4 days. SSO treatment induced about 30% conversion to A7 mRNA in mice
   analyzed on day 15, whereas a 20% shift was observed in mice analyzed on day five (FIG.
   10, top panel). Furthermore, mice given A7injections for 10 days, and sacrificed on day 11

     WO 2008/131807                                   81                      PCT/EP2007/061211
   showed a 50% induction of mRNA (FIG. 10, top). These in vivo data suggest that TNFR2
   SSOs can produce muTNFR2 A7 mRNA for at least 10 days after administration.
   Example 7 - Circulatory TNFR2 A7
   Mice were injected with SSO 3274, 3305, or the control 3083 intraperitoneal (i.p.) at 25
 5 mg/kg/day for 10 days. Mice were bled before injection and again 1, 5 and 10 days after the
   last injection. The concentration of soluble TNFR2 A7 in the serum was measured. SSO
   treatment induced soluble TNFR2 A7 protein levels over background for at least 10 days (FIG.
   11).
   To test the effects at longer time points, the experiment was repeated, except that serum
10 samples were collected until day 27 after the last injection. The results show only a slight
   decrease in soluble TNFR2 A7 levels 27 days after the last SSO injection (FIG. 12).
   Example 8 - Anti-TNF-a Activity in Mice Serum
   The anti-TNF-a activity of serum from SSO 3274 treated mice was tested in an L929
   cytotoxicity assay. In this assay, serum is assessed for its ability to protect cultured L929
15 cells from the cytotoxic effects of a fixed concentration of TNF-a as described in Example 1.
   Serum from mice treated with SSO 3274 but not control SSOs (3083 or 3272) increased
   viability of the L929 cells exposed to 0.1 ng/mL TNF-a (FIG. 13). Hence, the SSO 3274
   serum contained TNF-a antagonist sufficient to bind and to inactivate TNF-a, and thereby
   protect the cells from the cytotoxic effects of TNF-a. This anti-TNF-a activity was present in
20 the serum of animals 5 and 27 days after the last injection of SSO 3274.
   Example 9 - Comparison of SSO Generated TNFR2 A7 to other anti-TNF-a antagonists
   L929 cells were seeded as described above. Samples were prepared containing 90 pL of
   serum-free MEM, 0.1 ng/ml TNF-a and 1 pg/ml of actinomycin D, with either (i) recombinant
   soluble protein (0.01-3 mg/mL)) from Sigma® having the 236 amino acid residue
25 extracellular domain of mouse TNFR2, (ii) serum from SSO 3274 or SSO 3305 treated mice
   (1.25-10%, diluted in serum from untreated mice; the concentration of TNFR2 A7 was
   determined by ELISA) or (iii) Enbrel@ (0.45-150 pg/ml) to a final volume of 100 pl with a
   final mouse serum concentration of 10%. The samples were incubated at room temperature
   for 30 minutes. Subsequently, the samples were applied to the plated cells and incubated for
30  ~24 hrs at 370 C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. Cell viability was measured by adding
   20 pL CellTiter 96® AQueous One Solution Reagent (Promega) and measuring absorbance at
   490 nm with a microplate reader. Cell viability was normalized to untreated cells and plotted
   as a function of TNF antagonist concentration (FIG. 14).
   Example 10 - Stability of TNFR2 A7 mRNA and protein

     WO 2008/131807                                  82                     PCT/EP2007/061211
   Mice were treated with either SSO 3274 or 3272 (control) (n=5) by i.p. injection at a dose of
   25 mg/kg/day daily for five days . Mice were bled before injection and again 5, 15, 22, 27,
   and 35 days after the last injection. The concentration of soluble TNFR2 A7 in the serum was
   measured (FIG. 15A). Splice shifting of TNFR2 in the liver was also determined at the time
 5 of sacrifice by RT-PCR of total RNA from the liver (FIG. 15B). Combined with data from
   Example 7 , a time course of TNFR2 mRNA levels after SSO treatment was constructed, and
   compared with the time course of TNFR2 A7 protein in serum (FIG. 16). The data show that
   TNFR2 A7 mRNA in vivo decays at a rate approximately 4 times faster than that of TNFR2 A7
   protein in serum. On day 35, TNFR2 A7 mRNA was only detectable in trace amounts,
10 whereas TNFR2 A7 protein had only decreased by 20% from its peak concentration.
   Example 11 - Generation of Human TNFR2 A7 cDNA
   A plasmid containing the full length human TNFR2 cDNA was obtained commercially from
   OriGene (Cat. No: TC119459, NM_001066.2). The cDNA was obtained by performing PCR on
   the plasmid using reverse primer TRO01 (SEQ ID No: 116) and forward primer TRO02 (SEQ
15 ID No: 117). The PCR product was isolated and was purified using standard molecular
   biology techniques, and contains the 1383 bp TNFR2 open reading frame without a stop
   codon.
   Alternatively, full length human TNFR2 cDNA is obtained by performing RT-PCR on total RNA
   from human mononuclear cells using the TRO01 reverse primer and the TRO02 forward
20 primer. The PCR product is isolated and is purified using standard molecular biology
   techniques.
   To generate human TNFR2 A7 cDNA, two separate PCR reactions were performed on the full
   length human TNFR2 cDNA, thereby creating overlapping segments of the TNFR2 A7 cDNA.
   In one reaction, PCR was performed on full length TNFR2 cDNA using the forward primer
25 TRO03 (SEQ ID No: 190) and the reverse primer TRO04 (SEQ ID No: 191). In the other
   reaction, PCR was performed on full length TNFR2 cDNA using the reverse primer TRO05
   (SEQ ID No: 192) and the TRO02 forward primer. Finally, the 2 overlapping segments were
   combined, and PCR was performed using the TRO02 forward primer and the TRO04 reverse
   primer. The PCR product was isolated and was purified using standard molecular biology
30 techniques, and was expected to contain the 1308 bp TNFR2 A7 open reading frame with a
   stop codon (SEQ ID No: 125).
   Similarly, by using the TRO01 reverse primer instead of the TR004 reverse primer in these
   PCR reactions the 1305 bp human TNFR2 A7 open reading frame without a stop codon was
   generated. This allows for the addition of in-frame C-terminal affinity purification tags, such
35 as His-tag, when the final PCR product is inserted into an appropriate vector.

   A plasmid containing the full length human TNFR2 cDNA is obtained commercially from

   from human mononuclear cells using the TR006 reverse primer and the TR007 forward
   primer. The full length human TNFR1 cDNA PCR product is isolated and is purified using
10 standard molecular biology techniques.
   To generate human TNFR1 A7 cDNA, two separate PCR reactions are performed on the full
   length human TNFR1 cDNA, thereby creating overlapping segments of the TNFR1 A7 cDNA.
   In one reaction, PCR is performed on full length TNFR1 cDNA using the TR008 forward primer
   (SEQ ID No: 206) and the TR006 reverse primer. In the other reaction, PCR is performed on
15 full length TNFR1 cDNA using the TR009 reverse primer (SEQ ID No: 207) and the TRO10
   forward primer (SEQ ID No: 208). Finally, the 2 overlapping segments are combined, and
   PCR is performed using the TRO10 forward primer and the TR006 reverse primer. The PCR
   product is isolated and is purified using standard molecular biology techniques, and contains
   the 1254 bp human TNFR1 A7 open reading frame with a stop codon (SEQ ID No: 121).
20 Alternatively, by using the TRO11 reverse primer (SEQ ID No: 209) instead of the TR006
   reverse primer in these PCR reactions the 1251 bp human TNFR1 A7 open reading frame
   without a stop codon is generated. This allows for the addition of in-frame C-terminal affinity
   purification tags, such as His-tag, when the final PCR product is inserted into an appropriate
   vector.

   the TR016 forward primer. Finally, the 2 overlapping segments were combined, and PCR was
   performed using the TR016 forward primer and the TRO15 reverse primer. The PCR product
10 was isolated and was purified using standard molecular biology techniques, and was expected
   to contain the 1348 bp murine TNFR2 A7 open reading frame with a stop codon (SEQ ID No:
   127).
   Alternatively, by using the TR019 reverse primer (SEQ ID No: 221) instead of the TRO15
   reverse primer in these PCR reactions the 1345 bp murine TNFR2 A7 open reading frame
15 without a stop codon was generated. This allows for the addition of in-frame C-terminal

   Example 15 - Construction of Vectors for the Expression of Human TNFR2 A7 in Mammalian
   Cells
10 For expression of the human TNFR2 A7 protein in mammalian cells, a human TNFR2 A7 cDNA
   PCR product from Example 12 was incorporated into an appropriate mammalian expression
   vector. The TNFR2 A7 cDNA PCR product from Example 12 , both with and without a stop
   codon, and the pcDNA TM3.1D/V5-His TOPO® expression vector (Invitrogen) were blunt-end
   ligated and isolated according to the manufacturer's directions. Plasmids containing inserts
15 encoding human TNFR2 A7 were transformed into OneShot* ToplO competent cells
   (Invitrogen), according to the supplier's directions. Fifty mL of the transformation mix were
   plated on LB media with 100 mg/mL of ampicillin and incubated overnight at 370 C. Single
   colonies were used to inoculate 5 mL cultures of LB media with 100 mg/mL ampicillin and
   incubated overnight at 370 C. The cultures were then used to inoculate 200 mL of LB media
20 with 100 mg/mL of ampicillin and grown overnight at 370 C. The plasmids were isolated using
   GenElute TM Plasmid Maxiprep kit (Sigma) according to manufacturer's directions. Purification
   efficiency ranged from 0.5 to 1.5 mg of plasmid per preparation.
   Three human TNFR2 A7 clones (1319-1, 1138-5 and 1230-1) were generated and sequenced.
   Clone 1319-1 contains the human TNFR2 A7 open reading frame without a stop codon
25 followed directly by an in-frame His-tag from the plasmid; while clones 1138-5 and 1230-1
   contain the TNFR2 A7 open reading frame followed immediately by a stop codon. The
   sequence of the His-tag from the plasmid is given in SEQ ID No: 242. The sequences of the
   TNFR2 A7 open reading frames of clones 1230-1 and 1319-1 were identical to SEQ ID No:
   125 with and without the stop codon, respectively. However relative to SEQ ID No: 125, the
30 sequence (SEQ ID No: 231) of the TNFR2 A7 open reading frames of clone 1138-5 differed by
   a single nucleotide at position 1055 in exon 10, with an A in the former and a G in the later.
   This single nucleotide change causes the amino acid 352 to change from a glutamine to an
   arginine.

   TNFR1 A7
   For in vitro or in vivo delivery to mammalian cells of the murine TNFR1 A7 gene for
   expression in those mammalian cells, a recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) vector is
25 generated using a three plasmid transfection system as described in Grieger, J., et al., 2006,
   Nature Protocols 1:1412. PCR is performed on the purified murine TNFR1 D7 PCR product of
   Example 14 , using forward (TR043)(SEQ ID No: 238) and reverse (TR044)(SEQ ID No: 239)
   primers to introduce unique flanking NotI restriction sites. The resulting PCR product is
   digested with the NotI restriction enzyme, and isolated by standard molecular biology
30 techniques. The NotI-digested fragment is then ligated to NotI-digested pTR-UF2 (University
   of North Carolina (UNC) Vector Core Facility), to create a plasmid that contains the murine
   TNFR1 D7 open reading frame, operably linked to the CMVie promoter, flanked by inverted
   terminal repeats. The resulting plasmid is then transfected with the plasmids pXX680 and
   pHelper (UNC Vector Core Facility) into HEK-293 cells, as described in Grieger, J., et al., to
35 produce rAAV particles containing the murine TNFR1 A7 gene where expression is driven by
   the strong constitutive CMVie promoter. The virus particles are harvested and purified, as

   Example 32 - Expression of TNFR2 A7 in Mammalian Cells
15 The plasmids generated in Examples 26 and 34 were used to express active protein in
   mammalian HeLa cells, and the resulting proteins were tested for anti-TNF-a activity. HeLa
   cells were seeded in at 1.0 x 105 cells per well in 24-well plates in SMEM media containing L
   glutamine, gentamicin, kanamycin, 5% FBS and 5% HS. Cells were grown overnight at 37 0 C
   in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. Approximately 250 ng of plasmid DNA was added to 50
                      TM
20 mL of OPTI-MEM       , and then 50 mL Lipofectamine TM 2000 mix (1 part Lipofectamine TM 2000
                            TM
   to 25 parts OPTI-MEM       ) was added and incubated for 20 minutes. Then 400 mL of serum
   free media was added and then applied to the cells in the 24-well plates. After incubation for
    ~48 hrs at 37 0 C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere, the media was collected and the cells
                                              TM
   were harvested in 800 mL TRI-Reagent          . Total RNA was isolated from the cells per the
25 manufacturer's directions and analyzed by RT-PCR using the forward primer TR047 (SEQ ID
   No: 200) and the reverse primer TR048 (SEQ ID No: 201) for human TNFR2 A7, or the
   forward primer TR045 (SEQ ID No: 228) and the reverse primer TR046 (SEQ ID No: 229) for
   mouse TNFR2 A7. The concentration of soluble TNFR2 in the media was measured by ELISA.
   The anti-TNF-a activity of the above media was tested in an L929 cytotoxicity assay. L929
30 cells were plated in 96-well plates at 2 x    104 cells per well in MEM media containing 10%
   regular FBS, penicillin and streptomycin and grown overnight at 37 0 C in a 5% CO2 humidified
   atmosphere. The media samples were diluted 1, 2, 4, 8 and 16 fold with media from non
   transfected HeLa cells. Ninety pL of each of these samples was added to 10 pL of serum-free
   media, containing 1.0 ng/ml TNF-a and 1 pg/ml of actinomycin D. The media from the cells
35 were removed and replaced with these 100 pL samples. The cells were then grown overnight

   Reagent (Promega) was then added to each well. Cell viability was measured 4 hrs later by
   measuring absorbance at 490 nm with a microplate reader. Cell viability was normalized to
   untreated cells nd plotted as a function of TNF antagonist concentration (FIG. 17).
   The data from this example and from Example 9 were analyzed using the GraphPad Prism®
 5 software to determine the EC50 value for each antagonist. For each antagonist from these
   examples a sigmoidal dose-response curve was fit by non-linear regression with the
   maximum and minimum responses held fixed to 100% and 0%, respectively. The EC50
   values shown in Table 8 correspond to a 95% confidence level, and each curve had an r 2
   value ranging from 0.7 to 0.9.
