                                         ABSTRACT
A system and methods for managing a transformer area in an electrical distribution grid
having at least one substation transformer and one service transformer are presented. At least
one Remote Hub governed by a policy may be provided, which collects data about the
transformer area. The Remote Hub may also execute a discovery procedure to inventory
Remotes in the transformer area. The Remote Hub may use the collected data to detect events,
such as exceptional conditions, configuration changes, or derived results, within the
transformer area. Based on the collected data, the Remote Hub is able to transmit data about
the transformer area via a Substation-to-Edge channel. A method and system for forming and
establishing boundaries of Transformer Area Networks is also presented. Discovery
procedures may be used to form Transformer Area Networks out of Remote Hubs and
Remotes powered by the same phase of the service transformer.

FIELD OF THE INVENTION
[0002] The present invention is directed toward employing the electrical distribution grid as a
short and long-range transmission medium and data-bearing network, and further toward the use
of signals and messages on the network for the purpose of inferring schematic and topological
properties of the distribution grid, which vary over time.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
[0003] The power grid is generally considered to be composed of two logical regions, the
Transmission Grid(s) and the Distribution Grid(s). The Transmission Grid originates at large
generation points such as hydroelectric dams, nuclear reactors, wind farms, and coal-fired or gas
fired power plants. Power from the generation point is transmitted as high- voltage alternating
current (AC) over a loosely connected network of long, high- voltage lines to points where
demand for power exists, such as factories, farms, and population centers. At the edges of the
Transmission Grid there is a collection of
Distribution Substations. Distribution Substations contain one or more Substation Transformers,
which step down the voltage from high transmission line levels (typically 130kV to 700kV) to
the medium voltage levels (typically from 4kV to about 35kV) at which power is distributed to
consumers within a distribution service area. At the edge of the Distribution Grid are a number
of Service Transformers, which transform the medium voltage of the distribution grid to the low
voltages (in the US, typically 120V, 208V, 240V, 277V, or 480V). Other voltages in addition to

                                                    2
some of these can be used elsewhere in the world. In some cases, a tier of one or more
transformers, called step- down transformers, lying schematically between the Substation
Transformers and the
Service Transformers, create intermediate voltage reductions between the Substation and the
Service Transformers. Each Service Transformer powers one or more metered loads. A load can
be a dwelling, a commercial or industrial building, an element of municipal infrastructure such
as a series of street lamps, or agricultural apparatus such as irrigation systems. A typical
distribution grid includes other elements used to balance and regulate the flow of power.
Examples of such elements are capacitor banks, voltage regulators, switches, and reclosers.
Figure 1 illustrates a typical segment of the power grid.
[0004] Distribution grids have been designed and deployed in a variety of topological
configurations. In the United States, distribution grid types are typically characterized as radial,
loop, or networked. Other emerging cases are the campus grid and the microgrid. Additional
topologies, not described, are used elsewhere in the world.
[0005] Figure 2a is a topological schematic of a typical radial grid. In a radial grid, a substation
has one or more substation transformers. Each substation transformer has one or more substation
busses. One or more three-phase feeders "radiate" outward from each substation bus, with single
phase, double-phase, or three-phase lateral lines branching off from the feeders, and tap-off
points (or simply "taps") in turn branching from the laterals. Radial grids are inexpensive to
design and build because they are simple, but they are most vulnerable to outages because they
lack redundant power paths, so that any break causes at least one load to lose power.
[0006] Figure 2b is a topological schematic of a typical loop distribution grid. In a loop grid,
each end of select feeders is attached to a power source such as a bus of a substation transformer.
If the loop is undamaged, then power is available at all loads if either substation transformer is
operational. If there is a break in the loop, then power is available at all loads assuming that both
transformers are operational. In normal circumstances, a system of switches is used to ensure
that only one substation transformer at a time is delivering power to each segment of the grid.
[0007] Figure 2c is a topological schematic of a typical networked grid. This topology has
maximum redundancy. In addition to employing multiple power sources, all the service
transformers are linked to one another on the secondary side in a mesh

                                                   3
arrangement. Multiple breaks in connectivity are required to cause a power outage at any point.
Networked grids are most expensive to build and maintain, and are typically used in major urban
areas such as Manhattan or Washington, DC where high- value, high-criticality loads are
concentrated together.
[0008] Figure 2d shows a microgrid or campus network. Microgrids are not traditional in
electrical distribution technology, but are emerging as a response to increased focus on energy
conservation and on distributed generation of energy from renewable sources. Many variations
are possible. This type of grid is typically attached to, but severable from, a wider distribution
grid, and may contain its own power sources such as windmills, solar panels, or rechargeable
storage batteries as well as loads. The entire network may employ low- voltage lines.
[0009] A distribution substation receives high-voltage power from the transmission grid into one
or more large power transformers. A distribution transformer may incorporate a type of regulator
called a load-tap changer, which alters the voltage the transformer delivers to a power
distribution bus (the substation bus) by including or excluding some turns of the secondary
winding circuit of the transformer, thereby changing the ratio of input to output voltage. One or
more feeders depend from the substation bus. If too many feeders are required, additional
transformers and busses are used.
[0010] In order to monitor and control the components of the grid, current transformers (CTs) or
other current sensors such as Hall-effect sensors are attached to power-bearing conductors within
the substation. The CTs output a low current on a looped conductor which is accurately
proportional to the current delivered at the high voltage conductor being monitored. These low
current outputs are suitable for connecting to data acquisition subsystems associated with
Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCAD A) systems in the substation. Primary
monitoring CTs are designed and built into the substation, because changing or adding CTs to
the high-voltage components is impossible or dangerous while current is flowing. On the other
hand, additional CTs may be safely added to the low-current SCADA loops as needed without
impacting power delivery.
[0011 ] In addition to the power lines themselves, the distribution grid contains numerous other
devices intended to regulate, isolate, stabilize, and divert the flow of power. These devices
include switches, reclosers, capacitor banks (usually for power factor correction), and secondary
voltage regulators. All these devices affect the behavior of the distribution grid when considered

                                                    4
as a data-bearing network, as do the various loads and secondary power sources on the grid.
Devices that have abrupt state changes will introduce impulse noise on the grid, as can loads
turning on and off. Some devices, such as transformers and capacitor banks, filter and attenuate
signals at certain frequencies.
[0012] Other than the wires connecting a consumer load and the associated meter to a service
transformer, the service transformer is the outermost element of the distribution grid before the
power is actually delivered to a consumer. The meter is attached at the point where the power
from the service transformer is delivered to the consumer. Service transformers can be three
phase, dual-phase, or single phase, as can meters.
[0013] Traditionally, reading meters was one of the largest operational costs incurred by
electrical utilities. Original electric meters were analog devices with an optical read-out that had
to be manually examined monthly to drive the utility billing process. Beginning in the 1970s,
mechanisms for digitizing meter data and automating its collection began to be deployed. These
mechanisms evolved from walk-by or drive-by systems where the meter would broadcast its
current reading using a short-range radio signal, which was received by a device carried by the
meter reader. These early systems were known as Automated Meter Reading systems or AMRs.
Later, a variety of purpose-built data collection networks, employing a combination of short
range RF repeaters in a mesh configuration with collection points equipped with broadband
backhaul means for transporting aggregated readings began to be deployed.
[0014] These networks were capable of two-way communication between the "metering head
end" at a utility service center and the meters at the edge of this data collection network, which is
generally called the Advanced Metering Infrastructure or AMI. AMIs can collect and store
readings frequently, typically as often as every 15 minutes, and can report them nearly that often.
They can read any meter on demand provided that this feature is used sparingly, and can connect
or disconnect any meter on demand as well. AMI meters can pass signals to consumer devices
for the purpose of energy conservation, demand management, and variable-rate billing. Because
the AMI network is separate from the power distribution grid, AMI meters are neither aware of
nor sensitive to changes in the grid topology or certain conditions on the grid. Nonetheless, the
introduction of AMI is generally considered to be the beginning of the Smart Grid.
[0015] Many characteristics of the electrical distribution infrastructure have limited the success
of efforts to use the grid itself as a communications medium. First, the grid is a noisy

                                                    5
environment. As already noted, state changes in loads on the grid as well as control and
regulation artifacts on the grid itself cause impulse noise on the power line. Normal operation of
loads like electrical motors, simple variations in the overall load, and ambient RF noise (chiefly
from lightening and other weather-related causes) add up to significant Gaussian noise. The
measured noise floor at a typical substation in the United States sits at about 80-90dB below the
maximum amplitude of the 60 Hz fundamental. The complex impedance of the grid varies across
both the frequency and time domains. This may lead to loss of signal at a receiver sited at a
higher voltage point on the grid when impedance increases, or alternately force the transmitter to
use more energy than would be necessary on the average. Capacitor banks sited at points along
the grid for the purpose of optimizing the power factor can cause signal attenuation. Most
significantly, transformers act as low-pass filters, dramatically attenuating signals above a certain
frequency. The threshold frequency is not the same on every distribution grid, because different
arrangements and types of transformers are employed and because the transformers themselves
are not deliberately tuned to filter at a specified frequency. All these variables impact the
frequency response of the medium.
[0016] Additionally, injecting modulated current signals on the grid may cause interference
between the injected signals themselves. One problematic phenomenon is crosstalk, where a
signal injected on one power line is detectable on another line. When crosstalk occurs on two or
more phases of the same feeder, it can be caused by inductive and capacitive coupling, as the
phase lines run alongside one another for most of the length of the feeder. Crosstalk may also be
due to multiple phase windings on the same transformer core. Feeder-to-feeder crosstalk has also
been measured, and may be caused by reflection of the injected signal off the power bus at the
substation. Given the complexity, diversity, and age of the distribution grids in the United States
and the world, less is known about these phenomena than might be expected.
[0017] Finally, using the distribution grid as a communications medium often has side effects
which interfere with the primary purpose of the grid, which of course is delivering clean, reliable
power to consumers. If devices under power resonate with an injected
current, a phenomenon called flicker results. LED, CFL, incandescent and fluorescent lighting
visibly flickers in response to certain frequencies. This is annoying and sometimes dangerous, as
visual flicker has been demonstrated to cause both seizures and vertigo. Other types of devices,
such as fans and speakers, also resonate at certain frequencies, causing an audible hum.
ANSI/IEEE standard 519 requires any device (whether intended as a communication device or

                                                    6
not) that injects current on the grid to avoid doing so at certain frequencies and amplitudes to
avoid causing flicker.
Specifically, ANSI/IEEE standard 519 requires that no noise be added to the odd harmonics of
the fundamental at or below the eleventh harmonic.
[0018] Despite the many engineering difficulties inherent in using the power grid as a
communications medium, it has remained attractive to electrical utilities because the utility
already owns the infrastructure, and it is present at all the points where the utility needs to collect
data. Further, the regulatory and cost structure of publicly owned utilities (POUs) strongly favors
them using owned assets (which can be profitably purchased and maintained via service rate
increases) as opposed to paying operating expenses to a third-party communications provider
such as a telephone or cable provider.
[0019] High-frequency transmissions (above IMHz) are attractive because theoretically high data
rates can be achieved. Such schemes, called BPL for Broadband over Power Lines, offer a
potential theoretical bandwidth sufficient to deliver intemet access to consumers via a gateway
located in their electrical meter. In the early years of the twenty- first century, the Federal
Communications Commission (FCC) in the U.S.
actively promoted the concept of "Access BPL" as a means of delivering high-speed Internet
access to rural American families. Long-range transmission of BPL signals, however, is
impractical and expensive, because every transformer between the transmitter and the receiver
must be fitted with a bypass or repeater mechanism, or the low-pass filtering characteristics of
the transformer will block the signal. In the United States, where the number of consumers per
service transformer tends to be very small - in rural areas often only one - the cost to implement
BPL becomes prohibitive. Additionally, RF interference caused by BPL transmission has created
opposition from aviation, commercial radio, amateur radio, and other sectors. The FCC has
attempted to be supportive of BPL technology, but new compromise rules requiring BPL
installations to
be capable of notching out (avoiding) frequencies where interference is reported have increased
the complexity of managing a BPL service. Several attempts at deploying BPL consumer
services have been abandoned.

                                                  7
[0020] Under the umbrella name Power Line Communication or PLC, some medium-frequency
power line protocols have been used with success for Smart Grid applications, especially in
Europe (and other locales with European-style grid architectures), where the number of
consumers per service transformer is much larger than in the United States. The two most
commonly used medium-frequency PLC initiatives are PRIME and G3, both promoted by
commercial alliances based in Europe. PRIME uses orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing
(OFDM) at the physical layer, with 512 differential phase-shift keyed channels (DPSK). PRIME
achieves data rates as high as 128.6kbps, but is most reliable at 21.4kbps. Its frequency range is
42-89 kHz. G3 uses a similar physical-layer combination of OFDM and DPSK, offering 256
channels between 35 and 91k Hz with a data rate of 33.4kbps. Both G3 and PRIME are still
sharply attenuated by transformers, though in most cases a receiver located on the medium
voltage side of a service transformer can successfully read meter transmissions from low-voltage
sites served by that transformer, provided that the receiver is sited close enough to the service
transformer. For these reasons, Smart Grid technologies based on these protocols are common in
Europe and Asia. PLC protocols are also well-adapted to short-range power-line applications
such as arbitrating the charging of electric vehicles.
[0021 ] At the other end of the spectrum are ultra-low frequency systems, chiefly used for
control systems because they have little data-bearing capacity. Audio Frequency Ripple Control
(AFRC) systems are used mostly in rural areas for load management: to turn off high
consumption devices such as electric heaters and air conditioners during peak load times, or to
control use of other constrained resources, such as automated farm irrigation systems. An AFRC
transmitter sits on the high-voltage side of a substation or transmission transformer and may
service multiple substations. AFRC data rates vary from 2 to 10 bits per second, and the
maximum message length is about 100 bits. After such a transmission, the transmitter requires a
long idle period before it can transmit again, with a maximum duty cycle on the order of 10%.
AFRC systems cause obvious flicker, but not at a dangerous frequency. Because they are
typically used in areas of low population density and transmissions are infrequent, the side
effects are tolerated. AFRC is a broadcast technology operable from high voltage to low voltage
and thus cannot be used for collecting meter data or other data about edge conditions, because
that requires transmitting from low voltage to higher voltage.
[0022] Aclara®'s TWACS® technology operates by injecting pulses onto the power line when
the fundamental power carrier crosses the zero point - twice per 50Hz or 60Hz cycle. This
method operates either from substation to edge or edge to substation, and uses a polling protocol

                                                    8
to avoid having one edge transmission interfere with another. It is slow because it is tied to the
fundamental, and because of the polling architecture. It has been criticized by consumer groups
for the amount of impulse and broadband noise it introduces onto the grid.
[0023] Landis+Gyr employs a low-cost, low-frequency edge transmitter originally developed by
Hunt technologies, intended to operate in conjunction with AFRC to provide two-way
communication over long distances on the grid. The data transmission method using this
transmitter is cheap and reliable, but limited. It induces sympathetic current oscillations by
connecting variable impedance to the power line. The data rate is low because the transmitter is
dependent on a voltage relative to the power carrier, so that only a few pulses can be injected per
50Hz or 60Hz cycle. To achieve enough redundancy for detection at the receiver, the same signal
must be repeated for several cycles, resulting in a data rate measurable in cycles per bit rather
than bits per cycle. The method is also very noisy, in that each pulse resonates across a broad
frequency band.
[0024] Despite their limitations, low-frequency systems such as those from Aclara and
Landis+Gyr have achieved market penetration in rural areas where wireless systems are cost
prohibitive.
[0025] The problems with, and limitations of, the high, medium, and low-frequency PLC
methods as discussed above have led in the 21" century to rapid development of custom built
wireless networks for AMI data collection in the U.S. High-frequency on-grid methods have
proven to be too expensive, not sufficiently reliable, and too fraught with error and uncertainty to
be commercially viable. Low-frequency methods can be implemented with low-cost edge-to
substation transmitters, but these lack the data-bearing capacity required by modem AMI, and
on-grid low-frequency substation-to-edge
transmitters like AFRC are large, expensive, and have undesirable side effects which limit their
use in urban settings. One possible option would be to use high-frequency substation-to-edge
transmitters in conjunction with low-frequency edge-to -sub station transmitters. However, in the
U.S. market forces have led to the rapid penetration of wireless AMI systems, especially in urban
and suburban areas.
[0026] Cost constraints and availability of unregulated spectrum have dictated the use of mesh
architectures at the edge of the AMI networks, with neighborhood concentrators that collect data

                                                     9
from the meters and use traditional infrastructure (fiber or cellular) for backhaul to data centers.
Mesh architecture means that although the RF transceivers used have individually high data
rates, the edge networks are easily saturated. Most of the available data bearing capacity in these
networks is used just for reporting meter interval data, with limited capacity reserved for
firmware updates and control packets for applications such as demand management.
[0027] There are two major factors that limit the utility of the existing AMI
infrastructures. The first is, of course, the capacity limitations of the mesh. The second, and more
significant, is the fact that the AMI network is not congruent with the electrical grid. It is capable
of providing little information about the operational state of the grid. This is unnecessary for
meter reading, but more sophisticated Smart Grid applications for energy conservation, asset
protection, load balancing, fault isolation, and recovery management require accurate
information about the schematic relationship of grid assets, load and conditions on the several
segments of the grid, and the current state of bi-modal and multi-modal assets. This information,
together with the geospatial locations of the same assets, is called the Grid Map.
[0028] Utilities typically maintain two maps or models of the Grid. A Physical Network Model
(PNM) aggregates the geospatial location of the assets on the grid. PNMs, thanks to modern GPS
technology, are reasonably accurate with respect to point assets such as substations, capacitor
banks, transformers, and even individual meters. Inaccuracies stem from failure to update the
maps when repairs or changes are made. For example, a service transformer may move from one
side of a street to the other as a result of street widening. Longitudinal assets, especially buried
cables, are less well represented in the PNM. The PNM can contain as-designed data, but since
in many places the cable was
laid before global positioning technology had matured, the designs were based on ground-level
survey, and the original maps may or may not have been updated to reflect changes. Subsequent
surface changes complicate the problem of verifying the geographic path taken by medium
voltage distribution lines.
[0029] The second model is the Logical Network Model, or LNM. LNMs describe how grid
components are connected, without reference to their geospatial location. The LNM changes
frequently. During the course of repairs, the way transformers attach to taps and laterals, and
meters attach to transformers, may be altered. Such changes affect both the LNM and the PNM.

                                                   10
In many utilities, such changes are recorded manually by field agents. The manual reports may
or may not be updated in the LNM and PNM, and when updates are made the time lag between
maintenance occurring and its being recorded is variable. Additionally, many grid components,
especially regulators, switches and reclosers, change state automatically. Unless these
components are instrumented with communications back to a data center rather than simply
being subject to local control systems, such dynamic changes are not reflected in the LNM. They
do, however, affect the power path, the load and environmental stress on other components of
the distribution grid, and the service level to consumers.
[0030] Examples of significant but not reliably known aspects of the (actual) Grid Map are the
feeder and phase by which each meter is currently powered, the relative load on each phase of
each feeder, especially on subordinate branches (laterals) of the grid, the actual voltage supplied
to each meter, the power factor along the edges of the grid, whether all the power drawn at a
transformer is metered, and the state of switch sets, especially after a weather event that has
caused outages. If this information were reliably known, utilities could conserve energy, much of
the savings from which would pass on to consumers, save maintenance costs, prolong the life of
equipment in the field, improve the efficiency and life of utility and consumer equipment, avoid
outages, and reduce recovery times after unavoidable outages.
[0031 ] The problem of automated, dynamic grid mapping is not solved by wireless Smart
Meters. Smart meters can measure and record current, voltage and power factor (or phase angle)
at the meter, but because they have limitations on how much data they can store and how much
data capacity is available for transmission, utilities may choose not to program the meters to
report these data. The other data elements described cannot be detected by most modern AMI
systems. U.S Patent 7,948,255 to Coolidge, et al.
discloses instruments for phase detection. However, the instruments in Coolidge are intended to
be used by field engineers rather than incorporated into the Smart Grid.
[0032] The consensus among utilities is that the volatility of the LNM is such that using field
engineers to measure and monitor changing attributes of the grid map is not a cost effective or
workable solution. For example, conservation voltage regulation efforts were undertaken in the
1990s based on static measurements, and subsequently abandoned because the measurements
became outdated too quickly. Today, utilities habitually oversupply consumers, delivering an
average effective voltage of 122vAC to a 15 or 20 amp-rated circuit in a residence to ensure that

                                                  11
fluctuations in load, power losses in the home wiring, etc. do not result in some consumers'
service falling below 1 lOvAC effective at individual outlets inside the building, which is
generally the optimum for home appliances and the like. The goal of a well-instrumented fine
grained conservation voltage regulation system might be to reduce the typical effective voltage at
a single-phase meter to 114vAC as measured from one leg of the typical 240vAC service to
neutral. 114vAC effective at the meter is as low as it is reasonable to go without risking under
powering some outlets in the building, (i.e. not less than HOvAC at any outlet) due to additional
losses which are typical inside the home or office.
[0033] Since electrical devices consume more energy when powered at the high end of their
rated range, this practice of over-delivering impacts consumers' electric bills directly, as well as
forcing generation-poor utilities to buy power, increasing their costs. Ultimately, the practice
results in more fossil fuel being consumed than necessary.
[0034] Cost constraints also dictate that placing SCADA instrumentation at every medium
voltage field asset is impractical. The "touch points" on the distribution grid are, for better or
worse, largely the meters at the edge and the instrumentation in the substations. This dictates that
techniques for power line communication be revisited, because signals traveling on the power
line can be used both to infer and to report grid mapping information not detectable by means of
wireless AMI. The ubiquitous presence of wireless AMI for reporting meter data can be
considered as a benefit in the search for effective grid-mapping technology, in that it frees the
limited data-bearing capacity of low-frequency on-grid transmission methods to support grid
mapping systems instead. It is, however, needful to identify a transmission method that is low
cost at the edge, coexists with the AMR or AMI, and does not trigger any of the above-noted
pitfalls of on-grid transmission: requirements for intermediate devices such as repeaters between
the edge and the substation; unacceptable flicker; RF interference; impulse noise; etc.
Finally, the transmission must require very little power, because the energy expended driving the
transmitters reduces the energy conservation benefits obtained.
[0035] As discussed above, some existing PLC methods have adapted radio modulation
techniques and channel access methods to the medium of the electrical distribution grid. For
example, PRIME uses FDMA with DPSK.

                                                  12
[0036] In addition, Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) is a channel access method most
famously used in cellular telephony standards cdmaOne, WCDMA, and
CDMA2000. CDMA spreads its signal across a range or band of frequencies, as do other similar
technologies; hence the term broadband. Multiple access means that more than one transmitter
can use the same channel (here, a power line) without the signal from one transmitter
destructively interfering with the signal of another transmitter. In CDMA, each transmitter which
uses the same band is assigned a distinct reference code or chip. The transmitted signal equals
the exclusive OR (XOR) of the chip with the data signal. If the chips (treated as binary vectors)
are mathematically orthogonal, then the receiver can separate out the several data signals from
the additive received waveform. A requirement of standard CDMA as used in a wireless
application is that there is a dynamic feedback loop from receiver to transmitter to ensure that the
power of the several signals received from the different transmitters is the same or nearly the
same at the receiver. The feedback loop permits the transmitters to rapidly and dynamically
adjust their
transmission power to maintain the balance.
[0037] Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA) means that multiple channels in a medium
are created by having different transmitters use different frequencies (or different frequency
bands). A signal injected on the power line creates harmonic signals of different amplitudes. If
the frequency-division bands are incorrectly chosen, then the harmonics from different bands can
coincide and create false signals that interfere destructively with the intended signals. The
obvious means of eliminating this effect is to place the channels far apart on the frequency
spectrum. This, however, reduces the overall data bearing capability of the medium by "wasting"
spectrum.
[0038] A third channel access method is Time Division Multiple Access, or TDMA. In TDMA,
the channel is divided cyclically over time, with each transmitter sharing the channel assigned a
specific time slot in the cycle where that transmitter uniquely has permission to transmit. TDMA
requires that all the transmitters have system clocks which are synchronized with one another
within a close enough tolerance that one channel accessor does not overlap its transmission with
that of another channel accessor.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

                                                    13
[0039] The present invention includes a system comprising at least one intelligent edge
transmitter called a Remote Hub Edge Transmitter, each small enough to reside inside a Smart
Meter. A Smart Meter that contains a Remote Hub Edge Transmitter is called a Remote Hub
GLA Smart Meter, or simply a Remote Hub. The Remote Hub transmits by injecting a
modulated current into a power main that supplies an electric meter. The system also includes at
least one receiver sited at at least one electrical distribution substation operable to receive
transmissions from the intelligent transmitters. No additions or alterations to the distribution grid
between the Smart Meters and the substation are required to allow the receiver to reliably detect
and decode transmissions from the edge transmitters. The system further comprises one
Computing Platform for each substation that contains at least one receiver, the Computing
Platform having access to a conventional high speed network such as the Internet for
transmitting data acquired from the at least one receivers to a data center at which the received
data is used by a Concentrating Computer System, or Concentrator, to update other utility
systems such as, but not limited to, the LNM and PNM. In some microgrid deployments the
Computing Platform and the Concentrator may be the same server, with the data center sited
inside the service area of the microgrid. The system may additionally comprise Smart Meters or
other devices, such as field-deployed switches and voltage regulators, which are not Remote
Hubs, augmented by intelligent platforms operable to employ short-range PLC transmissions
using a well-known protocol such as G3 or PRIME to communicate with at least one Remote
Hub. Such augmented devices which are not Remote Hubs are designated as Subordinate
Remotes, and any augmented device, without regard for
whether it is a Subordinate Remote or a Remote Hub, may be referred to generally as a Remote.
Each Remote Hub manages only Remotes powered by the same service transformer as the
Remote Hub. A short range on-grid network consisting of a collection of Remotes comprising at
least one Remote Hub and zero or more Subordinate Remotes is called a Transformer Area
Network or TAN. A Remote is any device that can communicate in a TAN. Subordinate
Remotes and Remote Hubs are classes of Remotes. All Remotes have TAN transceivers and all
Remote Hubs have Edge Transmitters.
[0040] Subordinate Remotes, Remote Hubs, the Substation Receiver, and the associated
Computing Platform and Concentrator all contain stored programs on non- volatile computer
readable memory on which are stored instructions for operating a Grid

                                                   14
Location AwareTM (GLA) network. The Subordinate Remotes, Remote Hubs, the Substation
Receiver, and the associated Computing Platform and Concentrator also contain processing units
(CPUs) that execute the stored instructions allowing each node in the network to implement
methods for organizing the on-grid network and transmitting and receiving messages on the
network in order to permit other methods embodied as stored programs and executing on the at
least one Substation Receiver, Computing Platform and Concentrator to detect and infer
schematic grid location attributes of the network and publish the detected and inferred attributes
to other application systems including geospatial information systems maintaining the logical
and physical network model.
[0041 ] One method implemented by the Remote Hubs and the Substation Receiver provides for
channelizing and modulating current signals transmitted from the at least one Remote Hub in the
service area of an electrical distribution substation such that the signals are received at the
Substation Receiver and the Substation Receiver is able to infer the electrical phase of the
specific feeder upon which the signal was transmitted. The signal is transmitted on a broad band
of the frequency spectrum called a channel, but the frequency bands of channels are selected so
that the frequency is lower than the low-pass threshold of the service transformer that powers the
Edge Transmitter. Several modulation techniques have been used in this context, including
frequency spread modulation, Binary Phase-Shift Keying (BPSK), and Quadrature Phase-Shift
Keying (QPSK). Higher-order modes of phase-shift keying (mPSK) may be used. However,
BPSK and QPSK may be preferred embodiments along with frequency spreading, because
higher-order PSKs require more power at the transmitter in order to achieve the same signal
strength at the receiver. According to some embodiments of the methods, an Edge Transmitter is
capable of encoding at least 80 bits per second of post-FEC (forward error correction) data in a
burst transmission at low but adequate current so that the signal is not so significantly attenuated
by intermediate transformers, capacitors, long lines, underground wiring, and the like to prevent
reception by the Substation Receiver. In other embodiments, an Edge Transmitter may be
capable of encoding at lower bit rates. Encoding at lower bit rates improves reliability, but limits
the amount of data transmitted. In order to obtain the same post-FEC message success rate while
transmitting at at least 80 bps, different modulation types may require different Forward Error
Correction rates. The method requires little power to inject the signal, so that the signals as
modulated do not radiate energy in the RF spectrum or cause flicker or hum on devices in
proximity to the transmissions or exhibit any of the other undesirable characteristics of prior art
methods of on-grid messaging. The method works on all the grid topologies described herein

                                                 15
above, and can support a sufficient number of Remote Hubs per substation transformer that even
the largest substations can be fully covered by the resulting Grid Location AwareTM network.
[0042] The Substation Receiver may also implement a variety of methods of sampling the
ambient waveforms at a multiplicity of frequency bands on the power lines, filtering out the
high-energy harmonics of the fundamental power wave, detecting the signal on one or more of a
plurality of power lines (comprising each of the three phase lines of each feeder emanating from
each bus of a given substation transformer), inferring the phase and feeder combination on which
the signal was transmitted based upon a comparative analysis of each of the power lines, ranking
them based on the signal quality, error performance, and/or amplitude versus frequency at a
multiplicity of points throughout the spectrum of interest. When the Substation Receiver has
completely processed a transmission, it packages the decoded transmission together with any
additional information about the message inferred by the receiver logic, such as the phase and
feeder on which the message was transmitted, the channel on which the message was
transmitted, and an indication of the parameters of the modulation method used for that
transmission. The Substation Receiver forwards the entire message package to the substation
Computing Platform using a normal TCP/IP -based protocol such as HTTP.
[0043] Another aspect of the invention is a method of identifying which frequency bands are the
best data carriers at each substation transformer, defining at least one data-bearing channel on the
candidate frequency bands, optionally defining a series of time slots on each channel in which
edge devices may transmit, selecting a modulation technique, and, if frequency spreading is the
chosen modulation technique, defining a set of at least one orthogonal codes or "chips" per
channel to be used for modulating transmissions. The combined channelization model is then
employed by the method to provision the collection of GLA Smart Meters, including both
Remote Hubs and
Subordinate Remotes, supplied with power by a substation to assign to each of the at least one
Remote Hubs a policy describing on which frequency-based data-bearing channel(s) the Remote
Hub may transmit, and under what circumstances the Remote Hub must transmit. The policy
describes multiple aspects of the channels, including modulation method, frequency bands, chip
selection algorithm if chips are used, and message preamble pattern. Frequency-based channels
and chips must be assigned in such a way that transmissions are not destructive when segments
of the grid are, for example, switched from one substation transformer to another. The
provisioning scheme anticipates and minimizes the problem of crosstalk, and provides means for

                                                   16
logic on the Substation Receivers, the substation Computing Platforms and the Concentrator to
hierarchically process the messages received from each Remote Hub and use them to infer the
state of stateful non-edge features of the grid, such as switches, reclosers, and breaks in the
power lines. Other properties of the transmission are determined
dynamically by firmware and instrumentation on the Remote Hub. For example, the power used
when transmitting may be related to the impedance of the line as measured immediately prior to
transmitting.
[0044] In some embodiments of the invention, a number of techniques may be employed for
managing channel quality, depending on the availability of Substation-to-Edge broadcast
capability from adjacent networks, such as an AMI, AMR, and/or radio broadcast transmitter.
Software on the Substation Receivers and Computing Platform may monitor aspects of the
channel quality and take measures to ensure that messages
from the Remote Hubs experience an acceptably high success rate. According to one aspect of
the invention, an acceptably high success rate may be ensured by rotating the responsibilities of
the several channels, except that at least one non- structured channel is not rotated but remains
dedicated to provisioning and alerting. For example, if two data bearing channels have been
identified, and one data bearing channel demonstrates a higher success rate than the other, then
the network may be provisioned to have Remote Hubs alternate between transmitting on the
better channel and the other channel. This reduces the overall probability of a given Remote Hub
experiencing an unacceptably high message failure rate.
[0045] Other options for channel management may be to alter the definition of a channel so that
the channel has a wider frequency spread, and/or uses more FEC bits per burst. Still another
option is to move a channel to a different place in the spectrum, either permanently, or at
different times of the day based on an observed cycle in impedance, impulse noise, or some other
characteristic of the channel relevant to message success rate. None of these mechanisms require
a fast feedback loop between the Edge
Transmitters and the substations, as is the rule with some modulation techniques such as CDMA.
Rather, the apparatus at the substation conducts a time-duration analysis of the behavior of the
network, and then broadcasts new provisioning policy based on the analysis. Many
characteristics of the network may be taken into account when making a policy change, such as

                                                  17
observed patterns of crosstalk, variations in impedance, harmonic mixing, and the like. A policy
change may impact multiple substations, which may be interconnected by switching systems or
other forms of redundancy.
[0046] Yet another aspect of the invention is a method employed by the stored programs at each
of the at least one Remote Hubs to integrate the Edge-to-Substation GLA network with adjacent
networks, such as the AMI (regardless of the AMI architecture) and the higher-frequency PLC
based Transformer Area Network, as well as with the native intelligence of the Smart Meter
platforms themselves. In this method, the Remote Hub, whose high-frequency PLC protocol
stack (e.g. PRIME) enables it to act as the master node in the TAN, carries out the TAN
management activities. TAN management activities include, but are not limited to, polling the
PLC protocol stack to detect newly discovered Subordinate Remotes. The Remote Hub also polls
the local native Smart
Meter intelligence to obtain local data such as current, voltage, and phase angle, and polls the
reachable population of Subordinate Remotes to obtain similar data from the native Smart Meter
intelligence at the Subordinate Remotes. The Remote Hub then derives the results from the
collected data points. The Remote Hub stores, compresses, and/or processes the gathered data
according to the policies and application algorithms on the Remote Hub until the operable policy
dictates that the gathered data and/or derived results of the gathered data may be transmitted to
the Substation Receiver by the Edge Transmitter module of the Remote Hub. By way of
example, the Remote Hub might sample RMS voltages from each Remote including itself for a
period of one hour, storing and/or summing the samples, then compose a message containing the
highest and lowest voltage measured, the identity of the Remotes where these outlying values
were measured, and the average voltage over all the Remotes for the interval. Such "derived
results" are useful in providing a characterization of conditions in the TAN without requiring that
a large amount of data be transmitted to the substation. These policy-based "derived results" can
be thought as "apps" for Remotes and can be altered or changed from time to time.
[0047] The Remote Hub is further responsible for using its provisioned policy and discovered
TAN configuration data to determine when it is appropriate to format, encode, and transmit an
alert message on an edge-to-substation channel. Such messages may include pairing messages,
which report the discovery of a new Subordinate Remote, pairing alerts, which report the loss of
communication with a known Subordinate

                                                   18
Remote, other alerts which report changes in the TAN or at meters (such as power surges, sags,
and spikes), and scheduled data reports which transmit the data collected and derived from the
native Smart Meter intelligence in the TAN to the apparatus at the substation. In some
embodiments of the invention, channels are not time-slotted, and Remote Hubs may transmit
only exception reports or computed data reports on a randomized posting schedule in which an
adequate number of transmissions are performed to provide an acceptable probability of
achieving at least one successful transmission at the desired rate. All conditions which ultimately
trigger an Edge
Transmitter message, from a detected failure in a Remote to achieving the conditions required
for computing and reporting a derived result, can be described as events.
[0048] If slotted channels and/or time- scheduled transmission policies are used, the Remote Hub
may require a method of synchronizing its system clock to a known tolerance with other Remote
Hubs in the same service area. Each Remote Hub may poll the local meter or AMI network to
obtain the AMI network time, which the Remote Hub uses to determine when scheduled
transmissions must occur, and to obtain data blocks received via the AMI, which are intended for
the Grid Location AwareTM intelligence on the Remote Hub or on the Subordinate Hubs. Such
data blocks may include firmware updates and changes in network policy or provisioning that
will affect the subsequent behavior of the Subordinate Remote. The Remote Hub distributes
firmware updates and policy changes to the Subordinate Remotes as necessary via the local PLC
channel of the TAN. Additionally, Remote Hubs may synchronize based on a wireless broadcast
signal. If no synchronization method is available, channel access may not be based on time slots
at all. This reduces the data-bearing capability of the network but does not impact the ability of
the system to provide grid-location data. In some embodiments, Remote Hubs and/or
Subordinate Remotes may contain a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver. The GPS signal
may be used for synchronizing the Remote Hubs in addition to providing means to associate the
logical network model with the physical network model.
[0049] In still another aspect of the invention, the Computing Platforms and the
Concentrator maintain two master data tables that can be initially extracted from the utility's
PNM and/or LNM, or which can be entirely accumulated from reports from the Remote Hubs.
These data tables are the Inventory, which is a table of all the Remote Hubs and Subordinate
Remotes that have been detected, and the Grid Map, which is a schematic representation of the

                                                   19
grid's topology and state, similar to an LNM. The Grid Map and Inventory at substation
Computing Platforms may be partial, representing only the portion of the grid accessible to the
substation at least at certain times. The Grid Map and Inventory at the Concentrator generally
represent the entire utility service area, although gaps in the Grid Map may exist if
instrumentation of the service area with Remote Hubs and Subordinate Remotes is incomplete.
When the Computing Platform at a substation receives any message from a Subordinate Remote,
it compares the data in the message and the message enhancements inferred by the Substation
Receiver with the data in the Inventory and Grid Map. The logic and policy on the Computing
Platform are
used to determine if the local copy of the Grid Map and Inventory need to be updated, and
whether the update must be sent on to the Concentrator to update the master Grid Map and
Inventory. If the policy in effect at the Computing Platform so dictates, the data collected from
the edge is also forwarded to the Concentrator. The Concentrator in turn carries out policies
dictating which events and scheduled reports must be published out to other data center
applications.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
[0074] The present invention comprises a system and methods for constructing and operating an
on-grid data collection network in such a way as to integrate the network with other adjacent

                                                     22
networks and devices present at the edge, substations, and features of an electrical distribution
network, wherein the other networks and devices may include Smart Meters and the AMI and a
conventional network such as the Internet. The system and methods further integrate the data
collected by the on-grid data collection network at a data center and may publish the collected
data to other applications. The system and methods may also employ the capabilities of the
integrated networks to infer otherwise unknown static and transient attributes of the electrical
distribution grid and report them via the integrated networks for the purpose of improving the
physical and logical network models of the Smart Grid. This leads to the ability of the models to
support Smart Grid applications such as conservation voltage reduction, volt/Var optimization,
load balancing, fault isolation, and recovery management.
[0075] Figure 3 is a logical block diagram of the intelligent platforms of one embodiment of the
invention showing where the different intelligence resides with respect to a converged network
comprising a conventional wide area network such as the Internet, an Advanced Metering
Infrastructure, the medium voltage electrical distribution grid, and the at least one Transformer
Area Network connected at the edge of the medium voltage electrical distribution grid via at
least one service transformer. Figure 3 shows that the system may be divided into three regions
or tiers. The edge tier 301 comprises at least one Transformer Area Network (TAN) 302. Each
TAN comprises a Service Transformer 303, at least one Remote Hub 304, and zero or more
Subordinate Hubs 305. When Subordinate Hubs 305 are present, the Remote Hub communicates
with the Subordinate Hubs via a standard short range, PLC protocol, such as PRIME. The
Remote Hubs 305 may be operable to transmit current-modulated signals. To avoid having
multiple Remote Hubs unintentionally installed on a TAN, the installation procedure may
provide a mechanism to allow a newly installed Remote of either type to detect whether Remote
Hub is already present on the local TAN. The invention does not require the installation of
communication devices or other modifications between the edge tier and the substation tier.
However, if it is desirable to collect data from a feature of the medium- voltage grid such as a
capacitor bank, a variation of the Remote Hub device may be installed there. Such a Remote Hub
is technically still at the Edge Tier, since it is powered by a low-voltage outlet located at the
feature, and not directly from the medium- voltage line(s) upon which the grid feature is
installed.
[0076] Still referring to Figure 3, the substation tier 306 comprises at least one Substation
Receiver 307 operable to receive transmissions from the Remote Hubs in the edge tier without

                                                   23
recourse to any signal amplifiers, bypass mechanisms, or bridges installed on the medium
voltage infrastructure of the electrical distribution grid. The Substation
Receiver(s) connect via a local area network to a Computing Platform 308 containing non
volatile computer-readable memory and a CPU for storing and executing the software 309 which
maintains the Inventory and Grid Map databases and carries out the tasks of provisioning and
managing the converged data network. Additionally the Computing Platform stores and executes
software 310 which processes the Inventory and Grid Map data in combination with messages
received from the Substation Receiver 307 to infer information about the state of the Grid over
and above what the Substation Receiver alone can detect based only on incoming transmissions.
In some embodiments of the invention, the computer-based components of the Substation
Receiver and the Computing Platform components are hosted on the same server. In such
embodiments, the communications protocol (such as HTTP) used to transfer data between the
Substation Receiver and the Computing Platform software components need not change, even
though there is no physical local area network required. Computing Platform 308
connects to a conventional wide area network 311, such as the Internet, for the purpose of
communicating with a Concentrator 312 in the data center tier 313. In some
embodiments of the invention, and regardless of whether the Computing Platform and Substation
Receiver are the same server or separate servers, the servers may be configured in a redundant
cluster to ensure continuous operation of the system.
[0077] Referring again to Figure 3, the Concentrator 312 hosts software with an analogous
architecture to the software in the substation(s), comprising a network and data management
component 314 providing software services to one or more applications 315 for Grid Location
Awareness (GLA). The applications use conventional network-based messaging protocols such
as but not limited to JMS, SOAP, and REST to publish information to subscriber applications
such as a Geospatial Information System (GIS) 316. The data and network management
component 314 may integrate with AMI headend 317 for the purpose of causing the AMI
network to broadcast data blocks to the Remote Hubs in the edge tier 301. Data and network
management component 314 may integrate with AMI head end 317 using a standard protocol
and/or a proprietary interface defined by the AMI vendor.

                                                 24
[0078] Other embodiments of the invention may include the convergence of alternative ancillary
network components. For example, Substation-to-Edge broadcast capability and/or time
synchronization from the substations to the Remote Hubs may be provided by medium-voltage
PLC transmitters attached to the feeders at the substation rather than using an AMI for this
purpose. Likewise, a separate radio transmitter broadcasting messages originating at the
substation may be employed. The radio transmitter does not need to be physically located at the
substation as long as there is a low-latency network connection from the Computing Platform at
the substation to the transmitter. The same radio transmitter may serve as the Substation-to-Edge
channel for a multiplicity of substations. When the Substation-to-Edge channel is not an AMI,
synchronization of the Remote Hub clocks may be provided as described in US Patent
Application No.
13/566,481, titled System and Methods for Synchronizing Edge Devices on Channels without
Carrier Sense, which is incorporated herein by reference. In embodiments of the invention where
channels are not slotted, clock synchronization is unnecessary.
[0079] Figure 4 details how in one embodiment the Substation Receiver 401, here shown co
hosted on a single server with the other software components of the Computing Platform,
monitors the feeder lines 402 on the low- voltage side of the substation transformer 403 by
attaching secondary current sensors 404 to the SCADA loops 405 already in place. The
secondary current sensors provide inputs to the Substation Receiver. This coupling method
allows a Substation Receiver to be installed on a substation transformer without disrupting the
operation of the substation. Other coupling methods such as hot-stick clamp-on current
transformers are well known in the art, and may be equivalently employed in lieu of the
secondary coupling to SCADA loops method described herein. Some substations may lack
SCADA loops, or they may be inaccessible due to physical placement or due to utility
regulations.
[0080] Figure 5 details the software architecture and method used by one embodiment of
Substation Receiver logic 501 to capture, detect, differentiate, and decode the multiplicity of
signals being received from the Remote Hubs at the edge of the portion of the distribution grid
supplied by the substation transformer associated with this Substation Receiver. Inputs from the
GLA CT lines 504 arrive at data acquisition module (DAQ) 502 in real-time as raw digitized
signals where they are then buffered and recorded on ramdisk 503. Operating in parallel with the
DAQ process, Channelizer 505 reads the raw signals and reorganizes them by frequency band of

                                                 25
interest into channelized signals stored on ramdisk 506. Operating in parallel with the
Channelizer, Preamble Detector 507 samples the channelized signals received on every feeder
phase attempting to recognize the one or more preamble patterns which precede every
transmission. In one embodiment, the Preamble Detector looks for all legitimate preambles,
thereby allowing for the receipt of transmissions that are outside their allocated time slots or
which were transmitted on a non-slotted channel. The Preamble Detector may also use its
knowledge of the channel time slots in order to minimize the amount of channelized recordings it
must sample. In one embodiment, when the Preamble Detector finds a preamble, it determines
and marks the point or points in the data stream at which the Demodulator 509 should start
processing. Multiple copies of the same message may be detected due to crosstalk. All copies are
retained for demodulation. Preamble Detector 507 provides the marker information and
Channelized signal data to the Demodulator through ramdisk
508. Operating in parallel with the Preamble Detector, Demodulator 509 reads all copies of the
messages from ramdisk 506, uses the frequency bands and possibly time slots in which the
messages were found and the known policies of the Remote Hubs to determine how to decode
the message. Policy elements may include the modulation technique in use on the channel, the
time based access policy in use, and, if frequency- spread modulation is used, which chips could
have been used in modulation. Sometimes there may be more than one possible choice of chip. If
the demodulator attempts to apply the wrong chip, this will be indicated by a demodulation error
and/or FEC failure. This parallelized embodiment of the receiver logic permits multiple
processor cores to operate on each message stream, with the modules early in the data flow
operating on later transmissions, while modules late in the data flow operate on earlier
transmissions.
[0081 ] Still referring to Figure 5, Data Manager 514 may be responsible for
synchronizing the several processes' access to the data stored on the ramdisks 503, 506, 508, and
510, so that each process at a given time is operating on completed data that was output by its
predecessor process rather than attempting to access stale or volatile buffers. The Data Manager
also can copy data from the ramdisks to a large archive disk 513 for later study and post
processing. By the time the messages have been demodulated and written to ramdisk 510, they
have been enhanced with enough information to identify the transmitter and infer the feeder and
phase on which the message was transmitted, as described in more detail below. The message
bundle for each feeder-phase on which the message was received may include, but is not limited

                                                  26
to, the signal amplitude at characteristic frequencies within the frequency band, the signal quality
as determined by Demodulator figure of merit measurements, the time the signal was received,
and the chip, if any, with which the message was encoded. These message bundles are passed to
the Network Management and Grid Location Awareness software via interface 511. These
software components, not shown in Figure 5, but shown as 309 and 310
respectively in Figure 3, use the provisioning policies of the edge transmitters together with the
message properties and the message content to determine which Remote Hub edge transmitter
sent the message, and compare the signal characteristics of the copies of the message received on
each different feeder-phase input where it was detectable in order to establish on which feeder
and phase the message was actually transmitted. This conclusion is compared with the
information in the grid map to determine if a change in grid topology or state has occurred. This
allows the Grid Location Awareness (GLA) algorithm to infer not only the phase of a meter
where the phase was previously unknown, but also changes in switch states in loop or networked
configurations and schematic alterations in any type of grid resulting from repairs and
maintenance.
[0082] Referring once again to Figure 3, the software components 309 and 310 on the
Computing Platform 308 decode the demodulated, error-corrected message received from the
Substation Receiver at the semantic level. The semantic decoding may include decryption and a
CRC check on the decrypted message. This helps preclude the introduction of false data, for
example due to tampering with the firmware on the Remote Hubs, or installation of a meter from
a different service area on the network for malicious purposes. Once the message has passed this
level of decoding, the data payload in the message may yield additional grid awareness
information. A pairing message indicates that a new meter has been installed successfully, or that
a known meter is now connected to a different service transformer or a different phase of a
multi-phase transformer.
Scheduled data messages may provide information about voltage levels, demand, and power
factor at the edge, as well as any other data or results computed from data available from the
instruments at the Remotes, limited only by the data-bearing capacity of the channels. Even the
failure of a scheduled message to arrive is informative, indicating that there may be an outage.
Any copy of the message may be used to extract data, not only the copy from the feeder and
phase on which the message was determined to have been transmitted. Sometimes the main copy
may contain bit errors while crossover copies do not.

                                                  27
[0083] When all the information has been extracted from a message bundle at the substation, the
software components on the Computing Platform apply a policy to determine what data to
forward to the Concentrator 312 via conventional network 311 for further processing and
publication. In addition to carrying out data management policies, Computing Platform 308 may
analyze the archived raw and enhanced signal quality data in order to determine whether
beneficial changes in channel management ought to be made. When such changes are identified,
Computing Platform 308 may forward recommendations to the Concentrator to ensure that the
impact of all contemplated policy changes is understood at every substation that may be affected
before the policy is put into effect.
[0084] Considering now the devices at the edge of the network, Figure 6 shows an elevation of a
single-phase form 2s GLA Smart Meter 601 which is operable to act as a Remote Hub in a Grid
Location Aware (GLA) network. Form 2s is standard format for a residential single -phase meter
in the United States. Other embodiments of the Remote Hub device may integrate with three
phase meters, or may not be associated with a meter at all, but plug into a 120V or 240V or other
voltage outlet located at a building, especially in a microgrid setting where the edge of the
network is defined with a higher resolution than in a typical utility service area. In still other
embodiments, the Remote Hub device may be integrated with other devices and instruments on
the distribution grid, such as voltage regulators, capacitor banks, step-down transformers, and the
like.
[0085] A typical Smart Meter has a layered design of circuit boards conformal to the meter
housing, such as a cylindrical transparent dome constructed of glass or Lucite. In the depicted
embodiment, the dome may be approximately 1.5" taller than usual to accommodate the height
of the Edge Transmitter module 604. However, the height of the meter housing varies from one
manufacturer and model to another and does not place the meter in violation of the form
standard. Nearest the top of the housing is the Calculation and Display Board 602, which is part
of every Smart Meter. Typically, the display features on the Calculation and Display board such
as indicator lights and a digital readout may be accessed by other components in the housing via
interface 606. The Communications module 603 contains the AMI transceiver circuitry and
intelligence. In some Smart Meters the components of the Communications module 603 are
contained on the Calculation and Display Board, but other smart meters can accommodate
multiple types of Communications Modules by placing the communication components on a
separate board as shown. Both configurations are common. If on a separate board,
Communications Module 603 communicates with logic on the Calculation and Display board

                                                   28
602 via an interface and cable 606. Other types of component- to-component interfaces are
possible internal to the Smart Meter. The Edge Transmitter module 604 contains the long-range
GLA edge transmitter and also the short-range PLC transceiver for the TAN communications.
Module 604 also has a CPU/microcontroller with
nonvolatile memory that hosts and executes the stored programs of the Remote Hub control
logic, controlling the Edge Transmitter and the PLC transceiver, and the interface 606 to the
other logic boards 602 and 603.
[0086] Figures 7a, 7b, and 7c show top, bottom, and schematic views of one embodiment of the
Edge Transmitter module. Referring primarily to Figure 7c, the Edge Transmitter Module
communicates with other components of the meter 701 via UART (Universal Asynchronous
Receiver/Transmitter) 712. Power is delivered to power supply 703 from AC mains 702. Power
supply 703 provides appropriate low voltage DC power to computing unit 717, Amplifier Circuit
705, and Class D Amplifier 707. Computing unit 717 is a microcontroller processing unit with
on-board volatile and non-volatile memory, and is used for both short range and long range
digital signal processing and protocols 704, scaling and filtering 713, and to drive amplifiers 707
and 705. PLC Amplifier Circuit 705 and PLC Coupling Circuit 706 are adjusted so that the
medium-frequency signal emitted does not propagate outside the TAN, relying on the service
transformer' s filtering properties at this frequency, as described in more detail below. The
coupling circuit 708 for long range transmissions is much more powerful, requiring a special
isolation circuit 711 that prevents coupling circuit 708 from resonating with other long-range
transmissions and grid noise at the frequencies to which it is sensitive, when the Remote Hub is
not transmitting on a long-range channel. The main components of the coupling circuit 708 are
transformer 709 and capacitor 710. According to some embodiments, the Edge Transmitter
module may contain a GPS receiver, such as GPS receiver 718 shown in Figure 7c. Alternately,
the Edge Transmitter module may have access to the GPS signal from a GPS receiver located on
another component of the Remote Hub, such as the Calculation and Display board, or on a
mobile computing device used by an Installer. The Remote Hub may use the GPS signal to
record its geospatial coordinates, and/or for synchronizing transmissions on a slotted channel so
as not to collide with transmissions from other Remote Hubs. Additionally, a Remote Hub may
be programmed to report its geospatial coordinates, or a function of its geospatial coordinates,
such as the area of the TAN, on an Edge-to-Substation channel or to permit them to be read by a
mobile computing device. Remotes whose geospatial coordinates

                                                  29
were recorded in a geospatial database (e.g. a PNM) at the time of installation may also receive
their coordinates in a data block.
[0087] Figures 7a and 7b illustrate how the components of Figure 7a may be arranged to
conform to the shape of a form 2S electrical meter. As is apparent from Figure 7b, transformer
709 and capacitor 710 may be large components. Shown here removed from the assembly to
reveal the transformer, flux shield 715 normally covers transformer 709 to prevent magnetic flux
from the large transformer from interfering with the metrology unit below it. Referring to Figure
7 a, the components of Power Supply 703 occupy a region of the Remote Hub module at the
upper left, and the components of Class D amplifier 707 are shown at the upper right. In this
embodiment, a single microcontroller 717 contains circuitry, a processor, and nonvolatile
memory for firmware protocol stacks and network management logic 704, 705, and 713 (from
Figure 7c). The large components at the lower right are PLC coupling circuit 706, isolation
circuit 711, and an amplifier capacitor 716 for the long-range edge transmitter. Connector 712 is
the connector for interfacing with the other logic boards in the meter housing.
[0088] Figure 7d details the isolation circuit 711. This circuit provides the ability to disconnect
the coupling circuit of the Edge-to-Sub station transmitter from the power line. It is desirable that
the Remote Hub be isolated from the power line except when it is transmitting. This is because
the coupling circuit represents a substantial load when connected to the power line. The isolation
circuit consists of a Triac 718 and a relay 719. The purpose of the Triac is to allow connection to
the power line at the time of a zero crossing of the line voltage. This prevents the generation of
large transients that can damage components in the Remote Hub. Additionally, making the
connection with the Triac removes the concern of arcing on the relay contacts that reduces the
life of the relay. The sequence of events when a Remote Hub interacts with the power line is:
a. The Triac is closed at a zero crossing of the power line;
b. The relay is closed;
c. The desired action (generally a transmission) is performed;
d. The relay is opened;
e. The Triac is opened at a zero crossing of the power line.

                                                  30
[0089] Figure 8 is an elevation of a standard Smart Meter 801 with a standard Calculation and
Display Board 802 and a standard metrology unit 804. Meter 801 becomes a Subordinate
Remote GLA Smart Meter with the addition of PLC communication capabilities on the
Communications Module 803. The PLC communications components are small enough that they
can share space on Calculation and Display Board 802 with the AMI communications circuitry if
preferred. All three modules (if three are present) communicate via an interface, here, a serial
interface or UART 805. Other embodiments may employ a different, functionally equivalent
internal inter-component interface.
[0090] Figure 9 is a schematic diagram of the PLC communications components on the
Communications Module of one embodiment of a Subordinate Remote. By analogy with similar
components on the Edge Transmitter Model in Figure 7c, the communications module of a
Subordinate Remote comprises the basic meter 901, power input from AC mains 902, interface
to the basic meter 907, power supply 903, microcontroller unit 904, amplifier circuit 905, and
PLC coupling circuit 906. The transmitter may be tuned to ensure that the signals are sufficiently
attenuated by the service transformer not to be received above the service transformer or below
adjacent service transformers. A Subordinate Remote may also contain a GPS receiver.
Alternately, a Subordinate Remote may be programmed with its geospatial coordinates by means
of a GPS receiver in a mobile device used by an Installer. A Subordinate Remote which knows
its geospatial coordinates may report them over a Transformer Area Network to a Remote Hub.
This allows the Remote Hub to compute extended geospatial information such as the area and
extent of the TAN. The Remote Hub may report this extended geospatial information on an
Edge-to-Substation channel, or the information may be read from the Remote Hub by a mobile
device used by an Installer or other field engineer.
[0091] Figure 10a illustrates both the characteristics of the low end of the frequency spectrum on
a feeder-phase line of a typical distribution grid and the method employed by a Remote Hub's
Edge Transmitter to inject current modulated signals onto the grid in such a way to allow all the
TANs served by one substation transformer to be able to transmit scheduled Grid Location
Awareness reports at least twice in each 24 hour period, and to additionally transmit alerts as
necessary, without creating any of the difficulties described herein above which have been
observed with prior art methods of on-grid transmissions. Important characteristics of the
spectrum are the 50Hz or 60Hz power fundamental 1001, its harmonics 1002, and the noise floor
1003. It should be noted that from time to time a spike of impulse noise may exceed the usual
noise floor. The defined channel or channels for modulated signals transmitted by an Edge

                                                   31
Transmitter occupy a broad candidate spectrum lying between the 50 or 60 Hz power
fundamental and the low-pass threshold of the service transmitters on the host power grid. The
candidate spectrum for a particular substation is determined by measurement and set by policy
and subject to regulatory constraints. Measurements determine which band or bands of the
candidate spectrum are reliably received at each substation transformer. If a usable band is wider
than the bandwidth needed for a reliable transmission, then the channel band may be defined to
be variable. In such cases, the Remote Hub conducts measurements, described herein below,
prior to transmitting to determine at present conditions which part of the wider channel is
currently most favorable for transmitting. Conversely, at the Substation Receiver, the preamble
detector samples the entire wide usable band, determining the actual band used by the transmitter
based on where the preamble was detected.
[0092] Figure 1Oa shows three frequency bands 1004, 1005, and 1006, which have been defined
as channels for the long range Edge Transmitters. The number of bands used as channels is not
limited to three, nor are three channels always required. Transmissions on each channel are
spread across a defined frequency band as shown using a broadband modulation technique, such
as the ones identified herein above. Additionally, transmission bursts may be constrained to
occur in time slots such as 1007. Details of the slotting protocols are explained herein below.
[0093] Still referring to figure 10a, a typical frequency based channel of the present invention
may span a wide enough area of the spectrum that several harmonics of the power fundamental
occur within the channel. Because it is important to keep the amplitude of the injected,
modulated current as near as possible to the noise floor and to minimize the amount of power
used to transmit, in some embodiments of the present invention no signal is added to the
spectrum at harmonics of the power fundamental. A shaping filter may be beneficially applied by
the Edge Transmitter to avoid injecting current over the harmonics. This technique is also
beneficial at the Substation Receiver, which may apply comb filtering so that the preamble
detector and demodulator are not required to process the signal on the harmonics. This saves
valuable processor capacity in the compute-intensive demodulation process.
[0094] When the modulation technique used is frequency spreading, each frequency band (such
as 1004, 1005, and 1006), which is used as a channel, is assigned at least one patterned code, or
chip. The rate of frequency variation of the chip is much higher than the rate of variation of the
data signal. The actual frequency- spread transmission injected as current on the channel is the
exclusive or (XOR) of the channel's chip and the data signal. Adjacent and nearby channels are

                                                    32
assigned mathematically orthogonal chips. The amplitude of the frequency spread current signals
is as close as possible to the noise floor of the power line. This is beneficial in eliminating the
problems associated with prior PLC methods. For example, if a transmission on one channel is
"folded over" into another channel due to crosstalk, using the different encoding chips causes the
receiver to interpret the "stray" signal as noise, allowing the receiver to still extract the correct
signal. Additionally, and regardless of the modulation technique, any harmonics from one
channel which extend into adjacent channels will also be interpreted as noise. The result of this
combination of channel access restrictions and modulation techniques is one or more low
frequency, high-quality current-modulated channels that can bear (in individual bursts) a raw
data rate of 120 bits per second or more, or, by example, 80 bps after forward error correction,
using interleaving techniques to distribute data bits and FEC bits to minimize the probability of
loss of related bits due to impulse noise. Time-duration testing on a radial distribution grid,
transmitting an average distance of 3.5 miles line of sight from the substation, yielded a frame
error rate of 1.6e-6 using an FEC rate of 2/3 with frequency spread modulation. It is recognized
that the method and apparatus described may additionally be operated at lower data rates than
cited.
[0095] Figure 10b illustrates one method of organizing a group of three reliable channels to
support grid mapping. All three channels are organized into time slots 1007, within which
Remote Hubs are provisioned to transmit around a 5-second burst 1008 with around 1 second of
silence prior to the burst and around 1 second of silence after the burst. This yields an inter-burst
interval 1009 averaging 2 seconds long. Different time intervals may also be used. The reason
for the long inter-burst interval in the illustrated embodiment is that the mechanism for
synchronizing the transmitter clocks may be an AMI network, and the AMI synchronization
mechanism, being typically based on a mesh or cellular wireless architecture, is no more precise
than plus or minus one second. Collisions (overlapping transmissions) on the same channel must
be prevented because they will destructively interfere with one another if they were modulated
using phase-shift keying or the same chip. In one embodiment of the invention, each data
bearing frequency- spread channel is assigned a plurality of chips instead of one. For example, if
the number of chips per channel is two, then transmissions on even-numbered time slots use one
chip, and transmissions on odd-numbered time slots use another, mathematically orthogonal
chip. Using multiple chips may allow data-bearing capacity of the channel to be increased by
reducing the inter-burst interval, as overlaps of adjacent transmissions may still be decoded. The
ordinal number of a time slot is determined with respect to a Master Frame Origin, which may be

                                                   33
defined as beginning at midnight local time of each day, or may be established by a variety of
methods as described in US Patent Application No. 13/566,481 already referenced and
incorporated herein.
[0096] Two of the channels 1011 in Figure 1Ob have a scheduled organization. This means that
each Remote Hub is assigned specific time slots in which it may transmit on the channel. A third
channel 1012 is still organized into slots, but any Remote Hub with an exceptional condition to
report may attempt to transmit in any time slot, provided that it has not alerted recently.
Specifically, channel 1012 is organized by the method known as slotted aloha. Alerts, when
received at the substation, are typically acknowledged via a Substation-to-Edge channel such as
a wireless AMI network. If available, other methods for acknowledging alerts may be employed.
If no mechanism for acknowledging alerts is available, then each alert can simply be transmitted
multiple times, with a randomly selected number of slots having elapsed between the
transmissions. This, however, reduces the data bearing capacity of the alerting channel 1012,
because in standard slotted aloha, alerts are retransmitted only if they are not acknowledged. The
rate of message failure will be the frame error rate of the channel (already disclosed to be very
low) plus the rate of collisions. The rate of collisions in turn depends on the offered load, which
is based on the probability that more than one Remote Hub will attempt to transmit in a given
slot. The optimum number of unacknowledged retransmissions to maximize message success
rate is likely to be a small number such as two or three, because with higher transmission rates
channel saturation may occur.
[0097] The organization of an unscheduled channel may also use an un-slotted protocol similar
to pure aloha, wherein the channel is not divided into time slots, but wherein a transmitter may
attempt to transmit at any time, given that it has not already transmitted within a predefined
recent interval. In this organization, alerts may preferably be retransmitted only if not
acknowledged within a predetermined period of elapsed time, or they may routinely be
transmitted a multiplicity of times if acknowledging alerts is impossible or undesirable.
[0098] The number and organization of channels described is by example only. On some
substations, only one reliable channel may be available. When only one channel is used, either
because of conditions or by design, a plurality of time slots may be reserved for alerting, while
other time slots are scheduled. On some substations, a plurality of reliable channels will be
identifiable. The number of scheduled channels needed depends on the number of Remote Hubs
and the number of scheduled messages each Remote Hub must send in a 24-hour period. In one

                                                 34
embodiment, two channels are sufficient to permit 12,000 hubs to transmit twice daily. If (as is
usual) the substation transformer supplies many fewer than 12,000 hubs, fewer channels than are
available are required for scheduled messages, alert thresholds may be lowered, and more than
one channel may be dedicated to alerts to accommodate the higher offered load. Figure 10b
shows four alerts transmitted in the time interval shown. Two of the alerts 1010 have a high
probability of being detected at the substation receiver. The alerts 1013 have collided in Figure
10b and will not be received correctly. Figure lOe, conversely, illustrates how the use of chips
selected by means of the modulus of the time slot prevents some collisions. Here, because of
poor synchronization of clocks, message 1014, transmitted in an even-numbered slot of random
slotted channel 1012, has overlapped with message 1015, transmitted on the same channel in the
subsequent odd-numbered slot. Both messages are decipherable at the substation because they
were encoded using orthogonal chips. In yet another embodiment of the invention, an
unscheduled, unslotted channel might use frequency spread modulation and be assigned a
plurality of orthogonal chips. A transmitter offering a message would select a chip from the
plurality of chips at random, thereby reducing the probability that the message would collide
with another transmission on the same channel at an overlapping time.
[0099] Figure 10c illustrates the detailed organization of a typical single transmission burst,
whether it occurs on a scheduled channel or a slotted alerting channel according to one
embodiment. Within Time Slot 1007 and burst 1008, the message is comprised of preamble
1014, interleaved data bits 1015 and FEC bits 1016. The preamble is the same for all messages
on the channel. The FEC rate is not drawn to scale, and may be varied as needed from substation
to substation based on the quality of the available channels. In some grid locations and/or with
some modulations, FEC may not be required. Figure 10c without further elaboration may appear
to imply that the bandwidth is the same for all transmissions in the same channel, and that the
pattern used for preamble detection is also suitable for use by a Substation Receiver when
sampling and comparing signals on several inputs representing different phases of different
feeders to infer the line on which the signal was actually transmitted. Some embodiments of the
invention may require greater bandwidth for preamble detection than the data-bearing segment
of a message requires. Additionally, in some embodiments, the grid location of a Remote Hub
transmitter may be better inferred from a special transmission, called a probe transmission, again
measured at the substation on all phases of all feeders monitored by a Substation Receiver. The
probe transmission may consist of known modulated signal, or it may consist of pure tones. The
pure tones may be transmitted as a sequence of single tones, or one or more groups of pure tones

                                                35
may be transmitted simultaneously. The frequency range of the probe transmission may be
different from that of the other message sections. Figure lOd illustrates this bandwidth variation,
showing one bandwidth for the preamble 1018, another bandwidth for data-bearing message
1019, and a third bandwidth for GLA trailer 1020. GLA trailer 1020 is not present in all
embodiments of the invention, because the probe transmission may be present within preamble
1018. In another embodiment, the probe transmission may precede the preamble rather than
following the message. Generally, the segments of a message may be transmitted in any order as
long as the order is known by the receiver.
[00100] Figure 11 shows a Remote Hub 1101 and a Subordinate Remote 1102 illustrating the
local communication paths within a TAN according to one aspect of the invention. This figure
shows an embodiment where the Communications Module is not separate from the Calculation
and Display Module. The Remote Hub 1101 may poll each known Subordinate Remote, via a
PLC protocol such as PRIME or G3 using request path 1103. (To allow for the use of different
PLC protocols, the specific language of these standards is not used herein. By way of example, if
the PLC protocol in an embodiment of the invention were PRIME, then the Remote Hub would
be a PRIME base node and all other nodes would be service nodes.) A polled Subordinate
Remote 1102 retrieves the requested data from the Smart Meter and formats it into a response
which is transmitted as a response 1104. The Remote Hub's Edge Transmitter Module
communicates with the Communications Module and Calculation and Display Board
components via UART 1107, using a simple request/response protocol 1105 that may vary from
one Smart Meter vendor to another. Data path 1106 illustrates that both the Remote Hub and the
Subordinate Remote are members of the AMI and will be transmitting meter data to the AMI
head end in addition to performing TAN-related activities. The Remote Hub, in its role as TAN
manager, may make use of the AMI or other alternative, integrated channels in ways that
Subordinate Remotes may not. Only the Remote Hub is capable of sending out messages on the
Edge-to-Substation channel. A Remote Hub may also send messages on alternative, integrated
outgoing channels such as the AMI. The Remote Hub may additionally receive data blocks from
a Substation-to-Edge channel, whether the Substation-to-Edge channel is provided by the AMI
or other means. Such data blocks may contain, but are not limited to, alert acknowledgements,
firmware update broadcasts, and policy changes. Meter clock synchronization messages are part
of the native AMI protocol, but the Remote Hub may obtain the synchronized clock time from
the Calculation and Display module when an AMI is present.

                                                  36
[00101] Remote Hub 1101 has the capability to function in multiple operating modes. The
Remote Hub may function as a Subordinate Remote. The Remote Hub may also function as a
hybrid of Remote Hub and Subordinate Remote, called a Proxy Hub. When a Remote Hub 1101
is first installed, it monitors the PLC frequencies on the TAN for a period of time sufficient to
determine whether another Remote Hub is already present. The wait time consists of a fixed
period of time plus an additional period of time computed by a randomization function when the
device is powered on. The fixed period of time is sufficient to ensure that a Remote Hub
operating in the master mode would have executed its discovery algorithm, which would be
detected by the newly installed Remote Hub if another Remote Hub is operating within range.
Typically, "within range" means powered by the same service transformer, but exceptions occur.
The means of handling the exceptions are described herein below.
[00102] If a first Remote Hub is already present, Remote Hub 1101 indicates by means of a light
or digital display on the face of the Smart Meter that another Remote Hub is present. At this
point, an installer may elect to leave redundant Remote Hub 1101 in place, or replace it with a
Subordinate Remote unit. If left in place as a "spare," Remote Hub 1101 continues to function as
a Subordinate Remote, and the first Remote Hub continues to act as the Remote Hub and master
node in the TAN. If no other Remote Hub is present, Remote Hub 1101 begins to operate as a
master PLC node on the TAN, discovering and storing a list of any Subordinate Remotes 1102 in
the same TAN. A Remote Hub may also enter a third mode, Proxy Hub, as described below. As
soon as it takes on the master or hub role, Remote Hub 1101 obtains the network system time if
available, for example by querying the AMI logic in the Smart Meter, and formats, encodes, and
transmits a provisioning request on an Edge-to-Substation channel reserved for provisioning
requests and alerts. When a Substation Receiver detects the provisioning request, it may cause a
provisioning response to be sent, either via the AMI, or via an available on-grid or wireless
Substation-to-Edge channel. Provisioning data may also be supplied to a Remote Hub by means
of a handheld device or drive-by transmitter employed by the installer. The handheld device uses
a personal-area wired or wireless protocol, such as Bluetooth, infrared, USB, or RS232 to
program the Remote Hub. In embodiments of the invention where the Substation-to-Edge
channel is absent or very constrained, the Remote Hub may be provisioned via handheld without
knowledge of the inferred grid location of the Remote Hub. The same short-range protocol, in a
handheld or drive-by device, may be used to distribute firmware or policy updates to Remote
Hubs that lack a permanent Substation-to-Edge channel. It is sometimes desirable to activate a
policy or program change simultaneously on a collection of Remote Hubs. If the Remote

                                                   37
Hubs must be updated by means of a personal-area protocol, the programming device converts
the desired future activation time to a relative wait time as each Remote Hub is programmed, so
that even though the Remote Hubs were programmed at different times, they will activate the
updated programming at approximately the same future time. Remote Hubs may be
manufactured with a default policy, or pre-loaded with a default policy after manufacturing but
before installation, so that if no policy is provided at or subsequent to installation, the Remote
Hub still has a rule for operating.
[00103] The provisioning data provides the Remote Hub with the information it needs to manage
the TAN, including the location of, and organization of, other channels on the Edge-to
Substation network, and the ordinal or sequence number of slots on scheduled channels on which
this Remote Hub has permission to transmit. When the Remote Hub discovers Subordinate
Remotes, it transmits pairing messages on the Edge-to-Substation channel to inform the
Computing Platform that it is in communication with the newly discovered Subordinate
Remotes. Pairing messages may be transmitted on an alerting channel or on a scheduled channel
depending on a policy established by the network. When a Remote Hub acting in the master role
has discovered another Remote Hub on the same transformer and phase operating in the
subordinate role, the resulting pairing message indicates this. Including the presence of "spare"
Remote Hubs in the Grid Map may provide a cost savings and more rapid recovery, in that if the
master Remote Hub should fail, the TAN may be reconstructed by allowing the spare Remote
Hub to assume the master role. The master Remote Hub may cache its policy information on a
spare Remote Hub, if present, in order to allow the failover to occur even without re
provisioning the TAN.
[00104] Hereinafter are disclosed methods for properly partitioning Remote devices into TAN
groupings. PLC transmission power is controlled in order to keep the signal that gets through the
Service Transformer low enough to avoid interference with other TANs. Specifically, unless
special accommodations in configuration are made as described herein below, a Remote Hub
must poll and collect data from only Subordinate Remotes on the same phase of the same service
transformer as the Remote Hub. However, at certain sites on some grids, it may happen that at
PLC standard power and frequencies, the PLC transceivers in the Remotes may be able to
discover Subordinate Remotes and Remote Hubs on other phases of the same service
transformer, or even on adjacent or nearby service transformers. In this aspect of the invention,
the detectable remotes may be partitioned wherever possible so that each TAN comprises exactly
one master Remote Hub and all Subordinate Remotes, or Remote Hubs acting as Subordinate

                                                   38
Remotes, on the same phase of the same service transformer, and no Remotes of any type which
are on a different phase or a different service transformer.
[00105] In one embodiment of the invention, a Remote Hub's PLC protocol stack executes its
discovery process, which involves transmitting a beacon tone or message that causes other nodes
in the vicinity to respond. The first time this is executed, a standard initial power level is used.
The TAN management layer of the Remote Hub, operating above the PLC protocol stack,
obtains the list of discovered Remotes of any type. The Edge Transmitter of the Remote Hub is
then employed to send a pilot signal at sufficiently low amplitude and high frequency that the
pilot signal will not be detectable on the high- voltage side of the service transformer. (This pilot
tone is not the same as a PLC discovery beacon.) The pilot signal begins on a zero crossing of
the power fundamental of the phase on which the transmitter resides. Other Remotes (of any
type) that detect the pilot signal test to determine if the received signal began on the zero
crossing of the phase on which the receiving Remote resides. If so, the receiving Remote sends a
positive response on the PLC channel and records the identity of the Hub Remote that sent the
pilot tone. Another Remote Hub on the same phase as the pilot transmitter enters Subordinate
Remote mode and will be considered a spare. Subordinate Remotes on other phases do not
respond to the pilot tone. A Remote Hub that detects the pilot tone but is on a different phase
sends a negative response. The transmitting Remote Hub uses the responses to update its
inventory of TAN devices discovered automatically by the PLC discovery process, recording the
list of Subordinate Remotes and spares on its home phase, and the list of Remote Hubs on other
phases of the same service transformer. Remote Hubs that sent neither a negative nor a positive
response are presumed to be on another service transformer. If this case exists, the value of the
"initial" power level (amplitude) for the PLC discovery beacon is reduced, so that next time the
full discovery process is executed, it will be less likely that any Remotes on other service
transformers will respond.
[00106] Next, the first Remote Hub that transmitted the pilot tone examines the list of negative
responders, that is, of Remote Hubs on a different phase. It selects one such second Remote Hub
and orders it via the PLC protocol to transmit a pilot tone of its own. The first Remote Hub, still
the master node of at least all the nodes on the service transformer, collects the resulting positive
and negative responses and updates its inventory and partitioning data. At this point, any spare
Remote Hubs on the same phase as the second Remote Hub have also entered Subordinate
Remote mode, and the first Remote Hub now has a complete partitioning of Remote Hubs
according to phases, the Remote Hubs on the third phase, if present, being the intersection of the

                                                  39
Remote Hubs sending negative responses to the first Remote Hub with the Remote Hubs sending
negative responses to the second Remote Hub.
[00107] If a third phase is present, the first Remote Hub now selects a third Remote Hub from
the third phase, and orders it via the PLC protocol to transmit a pilot tone and return the list of
negative and positive responses it received. At this point, a positive response will have been
received from every Subordinate Remote on the service transformer, the phase and mode of
every device on the service transformer is known, and a potential master Remote Hub for each
single-phase TAN has been identified. Additionally, any node that responded to the original PLC
discovery process from outside the transformer area has been identified.
[00108] Now the first Remote Hub sets its PLC transmission amplitude to a very low level and
polls each remote. This first amplitude should be so low that no remotes respond. The first
Remote Hub increases its transmission amplitude until, ideally, all remotes on the same phase
and no remotes on another phase respond. The first Remote Hub records this low threshold level
and then continues to increase the amplitude until a remote on another phase responds. The first
Remote Hub records this as its high threshold level.
[00109] Now the first Remote Hub commands the second Remote Hub via PLC to attempt to
take on the role of PLC master node for its phase, sending in the command the low and high
threshold amplitudes. This is called the partitioning command. The second Remote Hub sets the
PLC transmission amplitude to the low threshold amplitude, and restarts its PLC stack as a
master node, conducting a PLC discovery process of its own. If the second Remote Hub
discovers all the Subordinate Remotes and spares on its own phase and no nodes on any other
phase, then has become the master of a single-phase TAN and the partitioning step has
succeeded. Otherwise, it raises its PLC transmission amplitude and repeats the process until the
partitioning step succeeds. If the second Remote Hub reaches the High Threshold amplitude
without having discovered all the Remotes on its phase, or if at any amplitude a Remote from a
different phase is discovered when no lower amplitude discovers all the Remotes on the same
phase, then the partitioning command has failed. The second Remote Hub signals the failure of
the partitioning command to the first Remote Hub by using its Edge Transmitter to transmit a
status beacon detectable by the First Remote Hub, since the first and second Remote Hubs can
no longer communicate via PLC.

                                                  40
[00110] If the first Remote Hub detects no failure beacon from the second Remote Hub, and a
third phase is present, the first Remote Hub sends a partitioning command to the third Remote
Hub, which carries out the partitioning step as described.
[00111 ] When the first Remote Hub has partitioned the other phases present without having
received a failure beacon, then it carries out the partitioning step itself. If the first Remote Hub's
partitioning step succeeds, then the service transformer is successfully partitioned into three
single-phase TANs, as shown in Figure 12a. In another embodiment of the invention, the second
and third Remote Hubs may employ a failure beacon and a success beacon. Use of the success
beacon may shorten the time required to complete the partitioning steps.
[00112] Referring now to Figure 12a, which is a simplified schematic drawing of a three-phase
service transformer and the meters that it supplies with power. This service area contains three
TANs 1204, 1205, and 1206, one for each phase of the service transformer. Each TAN contains
a Remote Hub 1202 and zero or more Subordinate Remotes 1203. Any Subordinate Remote may
actually be a spare Remote Hub. Figure 12a illustrates a proper partitioning of the Remotes
powered by a three-phase transformer following the discovery and partitioning algorithm
described herein above.
[00113] As is clear from the above description of a discovery and partitioning algorithm, it is
possible that for some multi-phase transformers there is no set of PLC transmission frequencies
that will yield a clean partitioning of the Remotes on the service transformer into single-phase
TANs. When the partitioning algorithm fails at any step, the first Remote Hub attempts to form a
multi-phase TAN which includes all Remotes on all phases of the service transformer, but no
Remotes which are not on the service transformer. Refer now to Figure 12b, which illustrates a
multi-phase TAN. Recall that the first Remote Hub already has an inventory of all Remotes on
any phase of the service transformer, and that it further is aware which nodes on each phase are
Remote Hubs. Beginning with the previously recorded "initial" PLC transmission amplitude, the
first Remote Hub initiates a PLC discovery process. If any Remotes are discovered which are on
a different service transformer, the first Remote Hub lowers the PLC transmission amplitude,
superseding the old value of the "initial" amplitude, and restarts the discovery process, repeating
this until all and only the Remotes known to be on the service transformer are discovered. If a
new Remote never before detected is found, the pilot beacon method above is used to determine
the phase of the new Remote and whether it is on the same service transformer as the first
Remote. If no transmission amplitude can be found that discovers all and only Remotes on the

                                                41
same service transformer as the first Remote Hub, the first Remote Hub transmits a distress alert
on an Edge-to-Substation channel and organizes the TAN at the highest amplitude which does
not discover any nodes outside the service transformer, even if some nodes on the service
transformer are unresponsive.
[00114] For Grid Location Awareness and the energy management applications that depend on
the Grid Map to be effective, probe transmissions must originate from each phase of the Service
Transformer. To accomplish this, the first Remote Hub, Master 1202 in Figure 12b, sends
commands to the second (and third, if present) Remote Hubs 1208, causing them to operate as
Proxy Hubs. A Proxy Hub behaves like a Subordinate Remote on the TAN, except that it is
responsive to certain commands from its master Remote Hub that allows the Remote Hub to
control the Proxy Hub's Edge Transmitter. Remote Hub 1202 stores the Edge-to-Substation
provisioning policies that would normally be carried out by the Proxy Hubs 1208. Remote Hub
1202 carries out all the TAN management activities, such as polling the Subordinate Remotes,
distributing updates, and computing derived results, for the Remotes, including Proxy Hubs, on
all phases present. When it is time for a Proxy Hub to send an Edge-to-Substation transmission,
the first Remote Hub 1202 formats the appropriate message and sends it to the Proxy Hub over
the TAN. The Proxy Hub then retransmits the message on the Edge-to-Substation channel. In
this way, Edge-to-Substation transmissions are always transmitted on the correct phase, even
though the TAN master is on a different phase.
[00115] The partitioning and discovery methods disclosed above are designed to accommodate a
standards-based PLC protocol stack such as PRIME. Use of alternative short-range PLC protocol
stacks may require minor modifications to the methods. More straightforward methods may also
be used in cases where customizations to the lower layers of the protocol stack are allowable.
[00116] In some embodiments of the invention, a Subordinate Remote rather than a Remote Hub
may take on the role of the TAN master. In such embodiments, Remote Hubs behave like Proxy
Hubs at all times, including during the discovery and partitioning process. Proxy Hubs must
include functions to allow the TAN Master to control its Edge Transmitter to send pilot signals
during the discovery and partitioning process. This is not fundamentally different from allowing
a first Remote Hub to control the Edge Transmitter of a second Remote Hub to send pilot
signals. Similarly, any Subordinate Remote must be able to accept a command from its current
TAN Master to become a TAN Master itself and attempt to form a TAN within a local PLC
frequency range indicated within the TAN. The TAN Master can transmit its own beacon

                                                  42
signals, because the local PLC transmitter is used for that purpose. Using this division of
function requires modifications to the partitioning and discovery methods so that the TAN
Master related functions are assigned to a first Subordinate Remote, and, in cases of multi-phase
transformers, a second and possibly a third Subordinate Remote, while leaving the Edge
Transmitter related functions with the first, second, and third Remote Hubs. A Remote Hub that
is the only Remote in a transformer area will implement its policy regarding Edge-to-Substation
transmissions by sampling only its local instruments. It will additionally continue to monitor the
PLC frequency for an invitation to join a TAN in case a Subordinate Remote is subsequently
installed in the transformer area.
[00117] Another aspect of a Remote Hub's channel management capability is that the Remote
hub may pre-modulate and store certain messages that do not contain variable data and may be
sent repeatedly. Examples of pre -recordable messages include messages sent on the
provisioning channel, such as the provisioning request and standard alerts on conditions such as
sags, over- voltages, and the like. This strategy saves computing power at the Remote Hub.
When policy changes such as changes in chip, channel placement, baud rate, FEC rate, and
bandwidth occur, pre-modulated recordings may need to be discarded and re-computed. This
may be done during idle periods when the Edge Transmitter's microcontroller CPU is not busy
with preparing scheduled messages. To accommodate this, such policy changes may be
announced in advance to take effect at a known future time as opposed to becoming effective
immediately.
[00118] In some embodiments, a Remote Hub may not be integrated into a GLA Smart Meter,
but instead may be associated with another feature of a medium voltage distribution grid, such as
a capacitor bank, step-down transformer, voltage regulator, storage battery, local generator, or
switch set. The Remote Hub may be integrated with local or remotely controlled SCADA
systems associated with the feature. The SCADA system may provide an Edge-to-Substation
channel for provisioning Remote Hubs used in this manner, or the Edge-to-Substation channel
associated with Remote Hubs in Smart Meters may also be operable to communicate with such
feature-based Remote Hubs. Such Remote Hubs may incorporate a version of a Substation
Receiver and be operable to send Pairing Messages associating the grid feature with other
Remote Hubs electrically and schematically subordinate to the grid feature. A Remote Hub may
also be embodied as a standalone device plugged into an electrical outlet. A form of Substation
Receiver may additionally be associated with such medium voltage grid features, or any
intermediate point on the medium voltage distribution grid. Such an intermediate Receiver may

                                                  43
collect information regarding which Transformer Area Networks are impacted by an associated
medium-voltage grid feature. The combination of such a secondary Receiver and Remote Hub
may be employed to control intermediate grid features, such as using a switch or relay to isolate
a microgrid or balance the load on a plurality of substations, or to alter the set-point on a voltage
regulator.
[00119] In a further aspect of the invention, a Remote Hub may carry out line measurements to
determine locally optimum conditions for transmitting. The Remote Hub always has the option
to vary the amplitude of the injected signal, and may additionally have the option to vary the
frequency band of the data bearing segment of the transmission.
[00120] To conduct the measurements, the Remote Hub transmits a sequence or simultaneous
combination of pure tones. These tones may be independent of an actual message transmission,
or they may be incorporated in the message preamble. Recall that the bandwidth of the preamble
may be different than the bandwidth of the data-bearing segment of the transmission. If there is
an opportunity to choose the frequency band of the data bearing segment, then the tones must
span the entire available spectrum. When the tones are transmitted, the current generated at the
requested voltage is measured. The relationship between the requested voltage and the generated
current is calculated at each frequency. The result will be proportional to the line impedance of
the grid at the Remote Hub for each frequency. This allows the Remote Hub to determine both
how much drive voltage is required to generate the desired current at each frequency in the
available frequency band, and, if there is a choice of frequency bands to use, to select the
frequency range that requires the least voltage to achieve the desired current. In some
embodiments where a Substation-to-Edge channel is available and has sufficient capacity, the
Computing Platform may from time to time send feedback from the Substation Receiver about
the messages as received. This may allow the Remote Hub to refine and calibrate its
measurement process. Outcomes of this feedback may include changing the slot assignments
and/or modulation methods of individual Remote Hubs and/or an entire channel to improve
message success rate.
