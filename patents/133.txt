                  DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
[0016]        Catheter ablation techniques (e.g., radio frequency (RF) ablation)
include ablating portions of dysfunctional tissue, such as tissue of a heart, stomach,
lung, ear, nose, throat and other organs. Some catheter ablation techniques are
used for treating cardiac arrhythmia, such as atrial fibrillation (AFib), in which the
heart tissue is ablated to terminate electrical pathways and block faulty electrical
impulses that can cause heart rhythm disorders. For example, a catheter may be
inserted through an incision in the skin and guided to the heart where the catheter
is used to create ablation lesions on the heart tissue.
[0017]        Before ablation of heart tissue is performed, catheters may also be
used to detect electrical activity of the heart for generating maps (e.g., high
resolution maps) of the heart. For example, intra-cardiac (IC) electrocardiogram
(ECG) signals of the heart are acquired (i.e., recorded for a period of time, such as
20 to 30 seconds) via a plurality of catheter electrodes placed at different areas of
the heart. The acquired signals are monitored and used, along with location
information indicating locations of the electrodes in a three dimensional (3D) space,
to create the dynamic maps of the heart. Based on a visual assessment of the maps,
a region of interest (ROI) of the heart may be determined, which may include an
area of the heart causing an irregular heart rhythm to be targeted for ablation.
                                            3
4915686-1

[0018]         Conventional catheters used to generate the heart maps and ablate
organ tissue include basket catheters and balloon catheters. Basket catheters
typically place a number of electrodes in contact with the surface of the heart such
that the electrode coverage of the cardiac chamber is sufficient for providing
accurate mapping of the electrical activity of the heart. The electrodes of these
basket catheters may not, however, conform well to the wall of the cardiac chamber.
The non-conformity is substantial in the left atrium which has a complex shape.
Accordingly, some basket electrodes suffer from poor contact (e.g., partial or no
contact) with the cardiac chamber such that electrical signals are not acquired via
these electrodes.
[0019]         Balloon catheters are placed within a cardiac chamber and include
portions which inflate to enlarge an opening or passage of the heart. The electrodes
of these balloon catheters typically provide better contact with the cardiac chamber
than basket catheters. The dimensions of balloon catheters are typically much
smaller than the dimensions of the mapped cardiac cavity, however, to prevent
physiological    fluid  (e.g.,   blood)  flow restriction  (i.e., blocking blood   flow).
Accordingly, balloon catheters provide less electrode coverage of the cardiac
chamber than basket catheters, which may result in a less accurate representation
of the electrical activity of the heart.
[0020]         The    present     application   discloses catheters   having  inflatable
components      configured     to prevent physiological fluid flow restriction while
maintaining electrode coverage of the cardiac chamber sufficient for providing
accurate mapping of the electrical activity of the heart. Embodiments include
catheters used for mapping of the heart as well as for both mapping of the heart and
ablating cardiac tissue.
[0021]          Embodiments described herein obtain accurate electrical activity
measurements to map the cardiac chamber in a single heartbeat and over a period
of time. Embodiments enable high density mapping in accordance with the cavity
mapping capability, such that the catheter does not need to be moved to different
                                              4
4915686-1

locations within the heart cavity to acquire the electrical activity data to map the
heart cavity.
[0022]        Systems, apparatuses and methods which facilitate ablation contour
control are also disclosed herein. For example, embodiments include electrode
arrays, having a plurality of individual electrodes, configured on catheter surfaces,
to provide high resolution mapping as well as being combinable into one or more
electrode groups, each acting as a larger electrode, facilitating the creation of
ablation outlines for ablation.
[0023]        Referring now to FIG. 1, an illustration of an example medical system
20 is shown that may be used to generate and display information 52 (e.g.,
anatomical models of a portion of a patient and signal information). Tools, such as
tool 22 can be any tool used for diagnostic or therapeutic treatment, such as for
example, a catheter having a plurality of electrodes for mapping electrical
potentials in a heart 26 of a patient 28. Alternatively, tools may be used, mutatis
mutandis, for other therapeutic and/or diagnostic purposes of different portions of
anatomy, such as in the heart, stomach, or other body organs.
[0024]        An operator 30 may insert the tool 22 into a portion of patient
anatomy, such as the vascular system of the patient 28 so that a tip 56 of the tool 22
enters a chamber of the heart 26. The control console 24 may use magnetic position
sensing to determine 3-D position coordinates of the tool (e.g., coordinates of the tip
56) inside the heart 26. To determine the position coordinates, a driver circuit 34 in
the control console 24 may drive, via connector, 44, field generators 36 to generate
magnetic fields within the anatomy of the patient 28.
[0025]        The field generators 36 include one or more emitter coils (not shown in
FIG. 1), placed at known positions external to the patient 28, which are configured
to generate magnetic fields in a predefined working volume that contains a portion
of interest of the patient anatomy. Each of the emitting coils may be driven by a
different frequency to emit a constant magnetic field. For example, in the example
medical system 20 shown in FIG. 1, one or more emitter coils can be placed below
                                           5
4915686-1

the torso of the patient 28 and each configured to generate magnetic fields in a
predefined working volume that contains the heart 26 of the patient.
[0026]        As shown in FIG. 1, a magnetic field location sensor 38 may be
disposed at the tip 56 of tool 22. The magnetic field location sensor 38 generates
electrical  signals, based on the amplitude and phase of the magnetic fields,
indicating the 3-D position coordinates of the tool (e.g., position coordinates of the
tip 56). The electrical signals may be communicated to the control console 24 to
determine the position coordinates of the tool. The electrical signals may be
communicated to the control console 24 via wire 45.
[0027]        Alternatively, or in addition to wired communication, the electrical
signals may be wirelessly communicated to the control console 24, for example, via a
wireless communication interface (not shown) at the tool 22 that may communicate
with input/output (I/0) interface 42 in the control console 24. For example, U.S. Pat.
No. 6,266,551, whose disclosure is incorporated herein by reference, describes, inter
alia, a wireless catheter, which is not physically connected to signal processing
and/or computing apparatus and is incorporated herein by reference. Rather, a
transmitter/receiver   is  attached    to  the  proximal end of the    catheter.  The
transmitter/receiver   communicates       with a signal processing and/or    computer
apparatus using wireless communication methods, such as IR, RF, Bluetooth, or
acoustic transmissions. The wireless digital interface and the I/O interface 42 may
operate in accordance with any suitable wireless communication standard that is
known in the art, such as for example, IR, RF, Bluetooth, one of the IEEE 802.11
family of standards (e.g., Wi-Fi), or the HiperLAN standard.
[0028]        Although FIG. 1 shows a single magnetic field location sensor 38
disposed at the tip 56 of tool 22, tools may include one or more magnetic field
location sensors each disposed at any tool portion. The tools (e.g., catheters)
described herein may also be used without a 3-D mapping system. The magnetic
field location sensor 38 may include one or more miniature coils (not shown). For
example, a magnetic field location sensor may include multiple miniature coils
                                              6
4915686-1

oriented along different axes. Alternatively, the magnetic field location sensor may
comprise either another type of magnetic sensor or position transducers of other
types, such as impedance-based or ultrasonic location sensors.
[0029]        The signal processor 40 is configured to process the signals to
determine the position coordinates of the tool 22, including both location and
orientation coordinates. The method of position sensing described hereinabove is
implemented in the CARTO mapping system produced by Biosense Webster Inc., of
Diamond Bar, Calif., and is described in detail in the patents and the patent
applications cited herein.
[0030]        The tool 22 may also include a force sensor 54 contained within the tip
56. The force sensor 54 may measure a force applied by the tool 22 (e.g., the tip 56 of
the tool) to the endocardial tissue of the heart 26 and generate a signal that is sent
to the control console 24. The force sensor 54 may include a magnetic field
transmitter and a receiver connected by a spring in the tip 56, and may generate an
indication of the force based on measuring a deflection of the spring. Further details
of this sort of probe and force sensor are described in U.S. Patent Application
Publications 2009/0093806 and 2009/0138007, whose disclosures are incorporated
herein by reference. Alternatively, the tip 56 may include another type of force
sensor that may use, for example, fiber optics or impedance measurements.
[0031]         The tool 22 may also include an electrode 48 coupled to the tip 56 and
configured to function as an impedance-based position transducer. Additionally or
alternatively, the electrode 48 may be configured to measure a certain physiological
property, for example the local surface electrical potential (e.g., of cardiac tissue) at
one or more locations. The electrode 48 may be configured to apply RF energy to
ablate endocardial tissue in the heart 26.
[0032]        Although the example medical system 20 may be configured to
measure the position of the tool 22 using magnetic-based sensors, other position
tracking techniques may be used (e.g., impedance-based sensors). Magnetic position
tracking techniques are described, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,391,199,
                                            7

which are incorporated herein by reference. Impedance-based position tracking
techniques are described, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,983,126, 6,456,828 and
5,944,022, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.
[0033]         The I/O interface 42 may enable the control console 24 to interact with
the tool 22, the body surface electrodes 46 and any other sensors (not shown). Based
on the electrical impulses received from the body surface electrodes 46 and the
electrical signals received from the tool 22 via the I/O interface 42 and other
components of medical system 20, the signal processor 40 may determine the
location of the tool in a 3-D space and generate the display information 52, which
may be shown on a display 50.
[0034]         The signal processor    40 may be included      in  a general-purpose
computer, with a suitable front end and interface circuits for receiving signals from
the tool 22 and controlling the other components of the control console 24. The
signal processor 40 may be programmed, using software, to perform the functions
that are described herein. The software may be downloaded to the control console 24
in electronic form, over a network, for example, or it may be provided on non
transitory tangible media, such as optical, magnetic or electronic memory media.
Alternatively, some or all of the functions of the signal processor 40 may be
performed by dedicated or programmable digital hardware components.
[0035]         In the example shown at FIG. 1, the control console 24 is connected,
via cable 44, to body surface electrodes 46, each of which are attached to patient 28
using patches (e.g., indicated in FIG. 1 as circles around the electrodes 46) that
adhere to the skin of the patient. Body surface electrodes 46 may include one or
more wireless sensor nodes integrated on a flexible substrate. The one or more
wireless   sensor nodes may include a wireless transmit/receive         unit (WTRU)
enabling    local  digital  signal processing, a radio   link,   and  a  miniaturized
rechargeable     battery. In addition or alternative to the patches, body surface
electrodes 46 may also be positioned on the patient using articles worn by patient
                                           8
4915686-1

28 which include the body surface electrodes 46 and may also include one or more
position sensors (not shown) indicating the location of the worn article. For
example, body surface electrodes 46 can be embedded in a vest that is configured to
be worn by the patient 28. During operation, the body surface electrodes 46 assist in
providing a location of the tool (e.g., catheter) in 3-D space by detecting electrical
impulses generated by the polarization and depolarization of cardiac tissue and
transmitting information to the control console 24, via the cable 44. The body
surface electrodes 46 can be equipped with magnetic location tracking and can help
identify and track the respiration cycle of the patient 28. In addition to or
alternative   to  wired   communication,    the body    surface  electrodes 46   may
communicate with the control console 24 and one another via a wireless interface
(not shown).
[0036]        During the diagnostic treatment, the signal processor 40 may present
the display information 52 and may store data representing the information 52 in a
memory 58. The memory 58 may include any suitable volatile and/or non-volatile
memory, such as random access memory or a hard disk drive. The operator 30 may
be able to manipulate the display information 52 using one or more input devices
59. Alternatively, the medical system 20 may include a second operator that
manipulates the control console 24 while the operator 30 manipulates the tool 22. It
should be noted that the configuration shown in FIG. 1 is exemplary. Any suitable
configuration of the medical system 20 may be used and implemented.
[0037]        FIG. 2 is a block diagram illustrating example components of a medical
system 200 in which features described herein can be implemented. As shown in
FIG. 2, the system 200 includes catheter 202, processing device 204, display device
206 and memory 212. As shown in FIG. 2, the processing device 204, display device
206 and memory 212 are a part of computing device 214. In some embodiments, the
display device 206 may be separate from computing device 214. Computing device
214 may also include an I/O interface, such as I/O interface 42 shown in FIG. 1.
                                           9
4915686-1

[0038]        As shown in FIG. 2, catheter 202 includes a plurality of catheter
electrodes 208 for detecting the electrical activity of the heart over time. Catheter
202 may also include one or more sensors 216, which include, for example, sensors
(e.g., a magnetic field location sensor) for providing location signals to indicate the
location of the catheter 202 in a 3-D space as well as sensors (e.g., position sensors,
pressure or force sensors, temperature sensors, impedance sensors) for providing
ablation parameter signals during the ablation of the heart tissue. The example
system 200 also includes one or more additional sensors 210, separate from the
catheter 202, used to provide location signals indicating the location of the catheter
202 in a 3D space.
[0039]        The system 202 shown in example system 200 also includes an RF
generator 218, which supplies high-frequency electrical energy, via catheter 202, for
ablating tissue at locations engaged by the catheter 202. Accordingly, catheter 202
may be used to acquire electrical activity for generating mapping of the heart as
well ablating cardiac tissue. As described above, however, embodiments may
include catheters used to acquire the electrical activity for generating mapping of
the heart while not used to ablate cardiac tissue.
[0040]        Processing device 204 may include one or more processors each
configured to process the ECG signals, record ECG signals over time, filter ECG
signals, fractionate ECG signals into signal components (e.g., slopes, waves,
complexes) and generate and combine ECG signal information for displaying the
plurality of electrical signals on display device 206. Processing device 204 may also
generate and interpolate mapping information for displaying maps of the heart on
display device 206. Processing device 204 may include one or more processors (e.g.,
signal processor 40) configured to process the location information acquired from
sensors (e.g., additional sensor(s) 210 and catheter sensor(s) 216) to determine
location and orientation coordinates.
[0041]        Processing device 204 is also configured to drive display device 206 to
display dynamic maps (i.e., spatio-temporal maps) of the heart and the electrical
                                           10
4915686-1

activity of the heart using the mapping information and the ECG data. Display
device 206 may include one or more displays each configured to display maps of the
heart representing spatio-temporal manifestations of the electrical activity of the
heart over time and display the ECG signals acquired from the heart over time.
[0042]        The catheter electrodes 208, catheter sensor(s) 216 and additional
sensor(s) 210 may be in wired or wireless communication with processing device
204. Display device 206 may also be in wired or wireless communication with
processing device 204.
[0043]         The processing device 204 may be guided by operator 30 to connect
one or more electrodes 208 of catheter 202 to the RF generator 218 for creating a
lesion with a guided shape on the inner surface of heart 26 (e.g. a curve).
[0044]        FIGS. 3 and 4 illustrate different states of an example tulip balloon
portion 300 of a tool, such as catheter 202. The tulip balloon portion 300 is located,
for example, at a tip of catheter body portion 302 in the form of an elongated shaft.
As shown in FIG. 3, the tulip balloon portion 300 includes four inflatable sections
304, each shaped similar to the shape of a tulip petal. The number of inflatable
sections shown in FIGS. 3 and 4 is merely exemplary. Tulip balloon portions may
include a different number of inflatable sections (e.g., less than or more than four
sections). In addition, the shape of the inflatable sections 304 shown in FIGS. 3 and
4 is exemplary. Tulip inflatable sections may be shaped differently from than the
inflatable sections 304 shown in FIGS. 3 and 4. Inflatable sections 304 can be
configured using polyurethane.
[0045]        As shown in FIG. 3, the four inflatable sections 304 include a pair of
opposing first inflatable sections 304 (i.e., left and right sections in FIG. 3) and a
pair of opposing second inflatable sections 304 (i.e., top and bottom sections in FIG.
3). Each of the inflatable sections 304 include a hole 306, located at each inflatable
section 304 such that a center of an inflatable section 306 is within a corresponding
hole 306. The shapes, locations and number of holes 306 shown in FIGS. 3 and 4
                                           11
4915686-1

are, however, merely exemplary. For example, numerous holes may be disposed at
different locations at each inflatable section 304.
[0046]        In some embodiments, one or more inflatable sections may include
protrusions for providing a pathway for the physiological fluid to flow through the
holes 306. For example, as shown in FIG. 3, each of the pair of opposing second
inflatable sections 304 include protrusions, in the form of two ridges 308, protruding
from an inner surface of a balloons section 304 and extending between opposing
ends of an inflatable section 304. The shapes, locations and number of ridges 308
shown in FIGS. 3 and 4 are also exemplary. Inflatable section 304 may include any
number of protrusions, such as ridges, configured to provide a pathway for the
physiological fluid to flow through the holes 306.        In some embodiments, tulip
balloon portions do not include any protrusions.
[0047]         Each of the inflatable sections 304 includes a plurality of electrodes
(e.g., 200 electrodes) disposed on its outer surface 310, which are used, for example,
to acquire electrical signals at different areas of an organ (e.g., heart 26) over time.
Electrodes are not shown in FIGS. 3 and 4 to better illustrate other features of the
tulip balloon portion 300 (e.g., features of the inflatable section 304). It can be
appreciated, however, that electrodes may be disposed at different locations of the
tulip balloon portion 300. For example, electrodes may be disposed on both an outer
surface 310 of an inflatable section 304, as well as disposed on both the outer
surface and an inner surface of the inflatable section 304 (e.g., an electrode disposed
on an inner surface can be used as reference to an electrode on the outer surface for
measuring unipolar IC ECG signals).
[0048]        The inflatable sections 304 are configured such that, when inflated, the
electrodes 208 disposed on the outer surfaces 310 of the inflatable sections 304,
contact inner surfaces (e.g., inner surface 402 shown in FIG. 4) of the heart chamber
walls to detect the electrical activity of the heart 26. Although not shown in FIGS. 3
and 4, electrodes 208 may also be disposed on the inner surface of inflatable section
304. These electrodes may be used as IC ECG reference electrodes.
                                             12

[0049]        Tulip balloon portion 300 may also include one or more location
sensors (e.g., magnetic field location sensor 38 shown in FIG. 1) in a tip of catheter
body portion 302. Location sensors are omitted from FIGS. 3 and 4 to better
illustrate the features of the tulip balloon portion 300 (e.g., features of the inflatable
section 304). It can be appreciated, however, that one or more location sensors may
be disposed at different locations at the tulip balloon portion 300. For example, one
or more of the inflated sections 304 may include a location sensor. The location
sensor may be embedded within an inflated section 304 or disposed on its inner
surface or its outer surface).
[0050]         One or more inflatable sections of a tulip balloon portion may overlap
with one or more other inflatable sections. For example, FIG. 3 illustrates each one
of the pair of opposing second inflatable sections 304 of the tulip balloon portion 300
overlapping adjacent first inflatable sections 304. As shown in FIG. 3, a first end
portion 312 of the second inflatable section 304 (the top inflatable section in FIG. 4)
overlaps the first inflatable section 304 (the left inflatable section in FIG. 4) and a
second end portion 314 of the second inflatable section 304 overlaps the first
inflatable section 304 (the right inflatable section in FIG. 4).
[0051]        In the first open state shown in FIG. 3, the first inflatable sections 304
are in contact with the ridges 308 of adjacent second inflatable sections 304. For
example, as shown in FIG. 3, the first inflatable section 304 (the left inflatable
section in FIG. 4) contacts the ridges 308 of the first end portion 312 of the second
inflatable section 304 (the top inflatable section in FIG. 4) and the first inflatable
section 304 (the right inflatable section in FIG. 4) contacts the ridges 308 of the
second end portion 314 of the second inflatable section 304.
[0052]        The inflatable sections 304 are configured with a flexible material.
Accordingly, when the first inflatable sections 304 inflate and contact the ridges 308
of the second inflatable section 304, the first inflatable sections 304 flex such that
middle portions (i.e., portions which include the holes 306 in FIG. 3) extend out
further from the interior of the tulip balloon portion 300 than end portions of the
                                            13
4915686-1

first inflatable sections 304. If the dimensions of the heart chamber are similar (e.g.,
axis of the atria and the balloon are of similar length) to the dimensions of the tulip
balloon portion 300 shown in the state at FIG. 3, the flexed shape of the first
inflatable sections 304 cause the electrodes 208, disposed on the outer surfaces 310
of the first inflatable sections 304 at portions 314, to contact inner surfaces of the
heart chamber walls. The flexed shape of the first inflatable sections 304 also cause
portions 316 of the outer surfaces 310 to be spaced from the inner surfaces of the
heart chamber and provide additional pathways for the physiological fluid to flow.
[0053]         Dimensions for the left atrium are, for example, 50mm to 80 mm on
the longitudinal axis (from septum to ridge) and 30mm to 50mm on the orthogonal
axis. Dimensions for the right atriums are narrower and of similar length. In one
embodiment the direction of deployment of the balloon in the left and right atria is
the longest axis of the corresponding atria. The dimensions of the inflated balloon
can be compliant with a full atrial size.
[0054]         FIG. 4 illustrates the tulip balloon portion 300 in a second open state
within a chamber of heart 26. A section of the chamber of heart 26 is not shown in
FIG. 4 to illustrate the positions of the inflatable sections 304 in the second open
state within the chamber of heart 26. In the second open state, the inflatable
sections 304 of the tulip balloon portion 300 further open to their positions shown in
FIG. 4 because the dimensions of the heart chamber are greater than the
dimensions of the heart chamber described above with regard to FIG. 3. As shown
in FIG. 4, when the tulip balloon portion 300 is in the second open state, the
inflatable sections 304 are in contact with the inner surface 402 of the heart
chamber. The inflatable sections 304 do not overlap adjacent balloons sections 304
and are spaced from each other forming gaps 404 between adjacent inflatable
sections 304. Accordingly, in the second open state shown in FIG. 4, electrodes 208
(not shown in FIG. 4) disposed on the outer surfaces 310 of the inflatable sections
304 contact the inner surface 402 of the heart chamber to acquire the electrical
                                            14

signals of the heart 26, while the gaps 404 between the inflatable sections 304
provide additional pathways for the physiological fluid to flow.
[0055]        FIGS. 5 and 6 illustrate different states of an example spring-like tip
portion 500 of a tool, such as catheter 202.       The spring balloon portion 500 is
located, for example, at a tip of catheter body portion 302. As shown in FIGS. 5 and
6, the spring balloon portion 500 includes an outer shell 502. The outer shell 502 is
an inflatable strip which includes a concentrically wound inflatable section 504 (i.e.,
including a series of concentric bands). The example spring balloon portion 500
shown in FIGS. 5 and 6 illustrate a single concentrically wound inflatable section
504 (i.e., single helix).    Embodiments may, however, include any number of
concentrically wound inflatable sections (e.g., double helix, triple helix, etc.)
Portions of the heart 26 are not shown in FIGS. 5 and 6 to illustrate the positions of
the inflatable sections 504 within the chamber of heart 26.
[0056]        The concentrically wound inflatable section 504 includes a plurality of
electrodes disposed on its outer surface to acquire electrical signals at different
areas of the heart 26 over time. Electrodes are not shown in FIGS. 5 and 6 to better
illustrate the features of the spring balloon portion 500. It can be appreciated,
however, that electrodes may be disposed at different locations at the spring balloon
portion 500. For example, electrodes may be disposed on the outer surface of the
concentrically wound inflatable section 504 as well as disposed on both the outer
surface and the inner surface of the concentrically wound inflatable section 504. The
inflatable section 504 is configured such that, when inflated, the electrodes disposed
on the outer surface of the inflatable section 504, contact an inner surface 402 of the
heart chamber to detect the electrical activity of the heart 26. Electrodes 208, when
positioned on the outer surface of section 504 may be used for delivering RF energy
to heart 26.
[0057]        FIG. 5 illustrates the spring balloon portion 500 in a first state. As
shown, the outer shell 502 forms a spheroid (egg-like) shape similar to the shape of
the chamber of the heart 26.        The outer surfaces of the concentrically wound
                                           15

inflatable section 504 and electrodes (not shown in FIG. 5) disposed on the outer
surfaces of the concentrically wound inflatable sections 504, contact inner walls of
an organ (e.g., a heart chamber). The concentrically wound inflatable section 504
separates, similar to a spring uncoiling, to form a gap 506 (e.g., continuous gap
between the concentric bands) which provides pathways for the physiological fluid
to flow. Accordingly, the spring balloon portion 500 provides electrode coverage
sufficient for providing accurate mapping of the electrical activity of the heart (e.g.,
accurate electrical activity measurements are obtained to map the cardiac chamber
in one heartbeat) without blocking the physiological fluid flow.
[0058]         FIG. 6 illustrates the portion inflatable section 500 in a second state.
In the second state, the concentrically wound inflatable sections 504 open to their
positions shown in FIG. 6 because the dimensions of the heart chamber are greater
than the dimensions of the heart chamber described above with regard to FIG. 5. In
the second state, the outer surface of the concentrically wound inflatable section 504
contacts the inner surface 402 of the heart chamber, causing electrodes, disposed on
the outer surface, to contact the inner surface 402 of the heart chamber and acquire
the electrical signals. In addition, the concentric bands of the concentrically wound
inflatable section 504 are further spaced from each other than in the first open
state, causing the gap 506 to become larger and provide a larger pathway for the
physiological fluid to flow.
[0059]         FIGS.    7-10   illustrate  different  examples    of  electrode  array
configurations in which electrodes are combined into one or more electrode groups,
each acting as a larger electrode for ablation procedures. FIG. 7 illustrates a top
view of an ablation contour of electrode array 700, in which individual electrode sets
702, used to provide high resolution mapping, are combined to simulate an ablation
macro-electrode for ablation. One or more electrodes can be selected and combined
(e.g., via a processor) with one or more electrodes to provide a larger ablation
electrode.

[0060]         The electrode array 700 shown in FIG. 7 includes a matrix of electrode
sets 702 each including six individual electrodes. As shown in FIG. 7, different
electrodes from the electrode sets 702 are grouped (e.g., selected via a processor) to
form an ablation macro-electrode 704 represented by the ellipse shown in FIG. 7. As
shown, the ablation macro-electrode 704 includes two electrode sets 702a having six
electrodes, and two electrode sets 702b having four electrodes. Each of the
electrodes in the macro-electrode 704 (i.e., in the ellipse) can be combined to behave
as a single, large ablation electrode, or as a series of ablation electrodes.
[0061]         FIG. 8 illustrates a side perspective view of the ablation contour of the
electrodes array 700 shown in FIG. 7. FIG. 8 also shows an estimated lesion 802
resulting from ablation (e.g., at 60 degrees Celsius) of tissue using the electrode
array 700.
[0062]         FIG. 9 is an illustration of another configuration of an electrode array
900, which includes seven electrodes 902 grouped in a circle to form a macro
electrode 904. The macro-electrode 904 simulates an ablation electrode in which the
small electrodes 902 combine and obtain a combined power to be used during an
ablation. The number of electrodes, and the circle shape of the electrode group
shown in FIG. 9, is merely exemplary. Electrode arrays can include any number of
electrodes grouped in configurations different from the configuration shown in FIG.
9 to provide a macro-electrode having power to be used during an ablation.
[0063]         The electrode array configurations (e.g., number of electrodes, shapes
of electrode groups) shown in FIGS. 7-9 are merely exemplary. Embodiments may
include electrode arrays having any number of electrodes grouped in configurations
different from the configurations shown in FIGS. 7-9 to provide a macro-electrode
having power to be used during an ablation. During the ablation procedure, any
number of electrodes, forming any shape, may be grouped (e.g., selected via a
processor) to form a macro-electrode for ablation.
[0064]         FIG. 10 is an illustration of another configuration of an electrode array
1000. As shown in FIG. 10, electrode array 1000 includes a matrix of electrodes

1002 equidistant from each other. As shown in FIG. 10, a portion of the electrodes
1002 are grouped together to form macro-electrode 1004 or as a group of macro
electrodes used to form a contingent ablation curve.
