   SPECIAL FILM-COATED CONTROLLED RELEASE FERTILIZER FOR PEANUT IN
                      ACID SOIL AND PREPARATION PROCESS THEREOF
TECHNICAL FIELD
[0001] The invention relates to the field of controlled release fertilizer technology, in particular to a
special film-coated controlled release fertilizer for peanut in acid soil, and further to a preparation
process of the special film-coated controlled release fertilizer for peanut in acid soil.
BACKGROUND
[0002] As one of the widely cultivated industrial oil crops in the world, peanut is characterized by
wide adaptability, drought resistance, barren resistance and symbiosis with nitrogen-fixing rhizobia,
contributes to development of water-saving agriculture, improves soil fertility and protects
agroecological environment. Peanut is a crop requiring a large amount of calcium, and needs to
assimilate 2.0-2.5 kg of calcium to form every 100 kg of pod. Calcium deficiency will lead to
hollow pod and rotten fruit of peanut. Peanut is mainly planted in dry sandy soil in the southeast
coastal areas of China, where there is low base saturation, high acidity, and huge calcium losses in
soil, thereby seriously impacting kernel growth and yield of peanut, and even resulting in total crop
failure. It is a research topic for peanut researchers to improve the peanut pod plumpness to increase
the pod yield and seed kernel quality when planting peanut in this area.
[0003] 18 elements are required for peanut growth, where nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and
calcium are most required, and sulfur, boron, molybdenum, zinc, manganese, iron and other trace
elements are also indispensable. Throughout the growth period of peanut, the nutrient requirements
are as follows: in the early stage, nitrogen fertilizer is mainly required, and application of proper
amount of nitrogen fertilizer can promote peanut growth and root nodule formation in the seedling
stage; in the intermediate stage, calcium fertilizer is mainly required, and is supplemented to
contribute to ideotype formation and promote fruit plumpness; and in the later stage, nitrogen and
potassium are mainly required, nitrogen fertilizer is supplemented to prevent later fertilizer
deficiency, and potassium fertilizer promotes the transport of photosynthate to pod. Nitrogen
fertilizer is volatile, phosphate fertilizer has weak ability to permeate upward and downward and
migrate or diffuse leftward and rightward in soil, potassium fertilizer antagonizes calcium ions, and
the peanut root mass most actively assimilating nutrients is below the fruiting layer. Therefore,

peanut fertilizer is most preferably applied into different layers or released by stages. At present,
fertilizers are mainly applied by rationally arranging fertilizer application opportunities, types,
quantity and method based on the principle of giving priority to base fertilizer, supplemented by top
application, according to the characteristics of peanut's demand for fertilizer and based on the soil
fertility. In order to achieve high yield, top application shall be arranged in the middle and later
growth stages of peanut, but top application will affect pegging downward and growth. Some
fertilizers shall be topdressed under strict conditions, thereby resulting in great difficulties in
production. Therefore, top application is labor-consuming and time-consuming.
[0004] The prior art provides many solutions for this circumstance. For example, CN103265350A
discloses a special fertilizer for peanut in acid soil, the raw materials of which include potassium
feldspar, borax, forsterite, phosphate rock powder, limestone, gypsum, urea and attapulgite clay
powder. Once-through fertilizer application can not only adjust the soil pH, but also meet the
nutritional requirements of peanut in different growth stages. Attapulgite clay powder is used as a
fast dissolving fertilizer adhesive, is rich in trace elements, and enriches soil nutrients. With
inorganic fertilizers commonly used in production as raw materials, the fertilizer does not pollute
the environment or crops, is characterized by reasonable formula, balanced nutrients and better use
effects, can significantly improve the fertilizer utilization rate and improve the peanut yield and
quality. However, the fertilizer release cannot be synchronous with the peanut demand in growth.
Use of controlled release fertilizers has become an inevitable research trend. However, at present,
there are few researches on special controlled release fertilizers for peanut in acid soil, and still
fewer controlled release fertilizers integrating release of nutrient elements by stages, disease and
pest control (nematodes, damping off, stem rot and leaf spot), improvement of stress resistance,
increase of exchangeable calcium content, etc.
SUMMARY
[0005] In order to solve the problems, such as seriously insufficient soil calcium ions, different
disease and pest control, easy occurrence of fertilizer deficiency in later stage, and labor-consuming
and time-consuming top application, in peanut cultivation in acid soil, the application provides a
special film-coated controlled release fertilizer for peanut in acid soil that integrates the ingredients
for enhancing stress resistance, increasing exchangeable calcium content, controlling diseases and
pests, promoting pod plumpness, etc., and can control the release period.

[0006] The application further provides a preparation process of the special film-coated controlled
release fertilizer for peanut in acid soil.
[0007] The invention is implemented using the following measures:
[0008] A special film-coated controlled release fertilizer for peanut in acid soil comprises an outer
layer, an intermediate layer and an inner layer, wherein the raw materials in each layer and the
proportions thereof are as follows:
[0009] the outer layer includes: 30-50 parts of urea formaldehyde powder, 20-40 parts of fermented
livestock and poultry manure, 30-50 parts of urea, 10-15 parts of hyperbranched polyamide,
0.01-0.05 part of chitosan oligosaccharide, and 0.3-0.5 part of celest,
[0010] the intermediate layer includes: 65-85 parts of lime nitrogen, 15-30 parts of humic acid,
0.3-0.5 part of celest, 0.3-0.5 part of chlorpyrifos, and 62-80 parts of urea formaldehyde powder,
and
[0011] the inner layer includes: 60-80 parts of potassium dihydrogen phosphate, 30-50 parts of urea,
10-20 parts of seaweed extract, and 20-50 parts of adhesive.
[0012] In the special film-coated controlled release fertilizer for peanut in acid soil, the raw
materials in each layer and the proportions thereof are preferably as follows:
[0013] the outer layer includes: 40 parts of urea formaldehyde powder, 30 parts of fermented
livestock and poultry manure, 40 parts of urea, 13 parts of hyperbranched polyamide, 0.04 part of
chitosan oligosaccharide, and 0.4 part of celest,
[0014] the intermediate layer includes: 75 parts of lime nitrogen, 25 parts of humic acid, 0.4 part of
celest, 0.4 part of chlorpyrifos, and 75 parts of urea formaldehyde powder, and
[0015] the inner layer includes: 70 parts of potassium dihydrogen phosphate, 40 parts of urea, 15
parts of seaweed extract, and 30 parts of adhesive.
[0016] In the special film-coated controlled release fertilizer for peanut in acid soil, the
hyperbranched polyamide is preferably an aliphatic hyperbranched polyamide of 2.0, 3.0 or 4.0
branching generation.
[0017] In the special film-coated controlled release fertilizer for peanut in acid soil, the fermented
livestock and poultry manure is preferably obtained from the following steps:
[0019] mixing 2-5 parts of chicken manure, 2-5 parts of sheep manure and 2-5 parts of cow dung at
a weight ratio to obtain a blended manure, chopping crop stalks into 5-8 cm small fragments, fully

mixing the crop stalks with the blended manure at a weight ratio of 2:8, stacking them in a 1.5-2 m
wide and 0.8-1.2 m tall pile, inserting a temperature gauge into the pile to measure the temperature;
then adding a fermentation agent (0.2% of the total mass) in a manner of adding 1/6-1/4
fermentation agent to a layer of 20-25 cm height piled in the process of piling until piling up to
0.8-1.2 m, adding water to reach       5 0 -6 0 % moisture content, fermenting, turning over the pile when
the temperature rises to more than 60 C until the pile temperature no longer rises, drying, and
pulverizing; and
[0020] 1 mL of the fermentation agent contains 1-1.5x10 9 Streptococcus thermophilus, 0.3-0.5x10 8
IU neutral protease, 0.1-0.2x10 6 IU cellulase, 3-4x105 IU triacylglycerol acylhydrolase, 1-2x10 5 IU
beer yeast and 3-4x 106 IU Bacillus subtilis.
[0021] A preparation process of the special film-coated controlled release fertilizer for peanut in
acid soil includes the following steps:
[0022] (1) mixing the raw materials potassium dihydrogen phosphate, urea, seaweed extract and
adhesive in the inner layer, granulating and drying to obtain granules in the inner layer;
[0023] (2) mixing the raw materials lime nitrogen, humic acid, celest, chlorpyrifos and urea
formaldehyde powder in the intermediate layer, adding the granules in the inner layer obtained in
step (1), granulating and drying to obtain granules in the intermediate layer; and
[0024] (3) mixing the raw materials urea formaldehyde powder, fermented livestock and poultry
manure, urea, hyperbranched polyamide, chitosan oligosaccharide and celest in the outer layer,
adding the granules in the intermediate layer obtained in step (2), granulating and drying.
[0025] In an application of the special film-coated controlled release fertilizer for peanut in acid
soil, the soil conditions for planting peanut are as follows: organic matter content: 8-12 g/kg,
alkali-hydrolyzable nitrogen content: 40-80 mg/kg, rapidly available phosphorus content: 30-60
mg/kg, rapidly available potassium content: 60-80 mg/kg, exchangeable calcium content: 0.1-2
mg/kg, pH: 4.5-6.5, moisture content from seeding time to seedling stage: 50-60%, moisture
content from flowering stage to pod-bearing stage: 60-70%, moisture content from fruit expansion
stage to maturation stage:  5 0 - 6 0 %.
[0026] In the application, the film-coated controlled release fertilizer is preferably applied at a rate
of 75±2 kg/Mu along with seeding or rotary tillage before seeding.
[0027] Celest is a suspension seed coating agent containing 2.5% fludioxonil (international generic

name), and can be used for controlling a plurality of seed-borne and soil-borne fungal diseases of
crops.
[0028] Repeated trials show that when urea formaldehyde powder is used together with fermented
livestock and poultry manure and urea, and the use levels of fermented livestock and poultry
manure and urea are more than a certain proportion, the release rate in early stage is increased,
which does not contribute to realization of the controlled release effect. Therefore, a small amount
of hyperbranched polyamide, if mixed therewith, can guarantee low release rate in early stage and
improve the controlled release effect whilst improving the proportions of fermented livestock and
poultry manure and urea.
[0029] The invention has the following beneficial effects:
[0030] (1) the fertilizer is applied as a seed fertilizer. Attention is paid to the effects of humic acid
and other organic fertilizers. In about 10 days (seedling stage) after seeding, the fertilizer releases
chitosan oligosaccharide, urea and bactericide (celest) to improve stress resistance of seedling,
promote seedling growth and prevent stem rot and damping off. In about 50 days (pegging stage)
after seeding, by sustained release of calcium fertilizer and humic acid, where humic acid plays a
role in activation of lime nitrogen and long-acting release of calcium ions, and by sustained release
of bactericides and insecticides, the fertilizer controls leaf spot and nematodes. In about 90 days
(fruit expansion stage) after seeding, by sustained release of potassium dihydrogen phosphate, urea
and seaweed extract, the fertilizer prevents fertilizer deficiency and premature senescence, and
promotes accumulation of photosynthate.
[0031] (2) The fertilizer integrates the ingredients for improving stress resistance, controlling
diseases and pests, activating calcium ions, and promoting pod plumpness, controls the release
period, improves fertilization efficiency without the need of top application throughout the growth
period, and saves labor cost.

  Example 1
[0095] In Examples 1, 2 and 3, the fertilizer is fast released in the early stage, and slowly released in
the later stage, thereby resulting in insufficient fertilizer efficiency and pesticidal effect in the later
stage. In Examples 4, 5, and 6, the fertilizer is slowly released in the early growth stage, thereby
failing to very well meet the nutrient requirements of peanut in the early stage, and the fertilizer is
fast released in the later stage, thereby resulting in the problem of wasting fertilizer efficiency. In
Examples 7, 8 and 9, the release rate well complies with the peanut requirements in various growth
stages. In the early stage, the fertilizer provides nitrogen to promote growth and nodule formation,
and releases chitosan oligosaccharide and celest to effectively prevent and control diseases and
pests in the seedling stage and improve resistance. In the intermediate stage, the fertilizer releases

calcium and humic acid to improve exchangeable calcium content in soil, and releases pesticide and
bactericide to prevent and control diseases and pests. In the later stage, the fertilizer releases
potassium dihydrogen phosphate and urea to provide nutrients for the later stage, and releases
seaweed extract to improve protective enzyme activities and prevent premature senescence. The
utilization rate of the active ingredients in Example 7 is higher than that in Examples 7, 8 and 9.
Compared with Example 1, in Comparison Example 1, in the raw materials in the outer layer,
hyperbranched polyamide was not added, and the fertilizer was fast released in the early stage, so
that the release of the active components in each layer cannot well comply with the demand for
active ingredients of peanut in various growth stages.
Effects on Pod Yield and Seed Kernel Quality
[0096] A field experiment was carried out in a hilly area of Xilou Community in Wendeng City of
Weihai (9.2 g/kg organic matter, 68.6 mg/kg alkali-hydrolyzable nitrogen, 52.3 mg/kg readily
available phosphorus, 69.4mg/kg readily available potassium, 0.25 g/kg exchangeable calcium, 0.11
g/kg exchangeable magnesium, pH 4.65) by applying the controlled release fertilizer in the
examples to an experimental material Huayu No. 22 along with seeding at a rate of 75kg/Mu, and a
common NPK compound fertilizer (15-15-15) was used as a control at a rate of 75kg/Mu. The
experiment was carried out by seeding on April 28 in an area of 33.3         in 2 ,  mulched ridge-furrow
cultivation, and harvesting on September 19, and was repeated 3 times.

       Example 1
[0097] Compared with the control sample, the peanut yield in the examples was significantly
increased by 27.1%-42.6%, because the number of fruits on single plants was significantly
increased, the wormy fruit rate was decreased, the number of plump fruits was increased, and the
pod kernel rate was improved. In the examples, both the protein and fat contents in kernels are
higher, and the O/L is significantly improved, compared with those of the control sample. In
Example 7 with the optimal proportion, the yield was increased by 42.6%, the protein content was
increased by 1.8%, the fat content was increased by 1.6%, and the O/L was increased by 9.2%,
compared with those of the control sample. Both the pod yield and quality in the Comparison
Example 1 are slightly worse than those in Examples 1-9.
[0098] As can be seen from the comparison of the cumulative release rate of active ingredients, pod
yield and seed kernel quality in the above two tables, the controlled release fertilizer according to
the application enables the active ingredient release to comply with element demand in the peanut
growth period by selection and optimization of controlled release ingredients according to the acid
soil characteristics,     integrates  the   ingredients    for enhancing     stress resistance,   improving
exchangeable calcium content, controlling diseases and pests, promoting pod plumpness, etc.,
improves the fertilizer efficiency without the need of top application throughout the growth period,
and saves labor cost. The fertilizer can significantly improve the pod yield and seed kernel quality,
and overcome the adverse effects of calcium deficiency and serious diseases and pests in acid soil
on peanut growth. The fertilizer is an efficient special controlled release fertilizer for planting
peanut in acid soil, contributes to high yield and high quality, and has very high popularization and
application values.
