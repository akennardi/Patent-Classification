                                         TECHNICAL FIELD
[0001A]          This disclosure relates generally to designating applications for public access or
private access on a computing device.
                                           BACKGROUND
[0002]           Computing devices often implement security measures to prevent unwanted or
accidental access to applications, features, or information provided by the computing devices.
Computing devices frequently store sensitive information that a user may not want other users to
view. Users may also generally want to restrict access to their computing devices by other users
as a matter of personal preference.        Example security measures implemented on computing
devices to prevent unwanted access include enforcing a security wall to prevent access to
applications on the computing device unless a particular security input is received. Typically, a
security code, password, or particular sequence of other inputs is required as a security input to
access applications on a computing device when a security wall is implemented on the device.
[0003]           Although enforcement       of the security wall restricts unwanted access to
applications on a computing device, the security wall also prevents the owner of the computing
device from easily accessing applications on the computing device. In most instances, the user
attempting to access the computing device is the owner of the computing device or an authorized
user.    Further, some applications on the computing device may be associated with private
information while other applications have little or no private aspect.

programming interface (API) of an operating system of the mobile device; means for allowing a
user to interact with the first functionality of the application in the public mode of operation
without receiving a security input from the user; and means for enforcing a security wall with
respect to the second functionality of the application, wherein enforcing the security wall
includes switching from the public mode of the mobile device to the private mode of the mobile
device in response to receiving the security input and only allowing to the user to interact with
the second functionality of the application when in the private mode of the mobile device.
[0003D]         According to a third aspect of the invention there is provided a system for
accessing applications on a computer system, comprising: means for designating an application
on a computer system for public functionality or private functionality, where the computer
system has a public mode and a private mode of operation, and where the designating is by the
application through an application programming interface (API) of an operating system of the
computer device; means for enforcing a security wall with respect to the application when the
application is designated for private functionality, wherein enforcing the security wall includes
presenting only objects that are selectable in the public mode to invoke public applications until
a security input is received; and means for, in response to receiving the security input, switching
from the public mode to the private mode of the computer system and presenting objects that are

[0004]          Also described herein is a method for designating applications for public access or
private access on a computing device is disclosed. An application on the computing device is
designated for private functionality or public functionality.    A security wall is enforced with
respect to the application if the application is designated for private functionality, wherein
enforcing the security wall includes preventing access to the application until a security input is
                                                  3

received.   Access to the application is provided if the application is designated for public
functionality, wherein providing access to the application includes allowing a user to access the
application without receiving the security input from the user.
[0005]          Implementations can include any or all of the following features.        Providing
access to the application includes requiring a second input from the user before allowing the user
to access the application, the second input different from the security input. The second input
includes a predefined sequence of multiple inputs associated with a tactile button on the
computer system, the tactile button associated with receiving input for a functionality of the
computer system different from functionality provided by the application.      The application is
designated based on a request received from the user.           The application is automatically
designated based on at least one of an application type associated with the application, a time
since the application was previously accessed, or a frequency of use of the application.
[0006]          Providing access to the application includes generating for display a visual
indicator of availability of the application in a public mode of the computer system. Generating
the visual indicator for display includes displaying a particular visual indicator for each
application in a group of applications, wherein each application in the group of applications is
designated for public functionality.     The group of applications is a subset of all applications
designated for public functionality and the displayed group of applications is displayed based on
at least one of a geographic location of the computer system, a current date or time of day, a
context associated with the user, a recent action performed by the user, or a level of importance
of information associated with a particular application.
[00071          Designating    the  application   for public  or private   functionality  includes
designating at least one of a plurality of functions of the application for public functionality
                                                   4

1002000765
while designating a remaining portion of the plurality of functions of the application for private
functionality. Enforcing the security wall includes preventing access to the remaining portion of
the plurality of functions designated for private functionality until the security input is received
and allowing the user to access the at least one function of the application designated for public
functionality without receiving the security input. The method further comprises automatically
designating a particular application for private functionality after a certain time period has
elapsed since a previous use of the particular application.
[0008]          Also described herein is a computer program product is tangibly embodied in a
computer-readable storage medium and includes instructions that, when executed, determine that
a first functionality of an application is designated for public functionality and a second
functionality of the application is designated for private functionality. Access is provided to the
first functionality of the application, wherein providing access to the first functionality of the
application includes allowing a user to access the first functionality of the application without
receiving a security input from the user. A security wall is enforced with respect to the second
functionality of the application, wherein enforcing the security wall includes preventing access to
the second functionality of the application until the security input is received.
[0009]          Implementations can include any or all of the following features.          Providing
access to the first functionality of the application includes requiring a second input from the user
before allowing the user to access the application, the second input different from the security
input. The second functionality of the application includes a purchasing functionality allowing
the user to conduct a purchase through the application. The first functionality of the application
is automatically determined as designated for public functionality based on a type of
functionality associated with the first functionality and the second functionality of the application
                                                   5

                                    DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0022]          A computing device can implement a security wall to prohibit unwanted users
from accessing functionality provided by the computing device. Instead of applying the security
wall to all functionality of the computing device, the computing device can apply the security
wall only to functionality designated as private while allowing user access to functionality
designated as public.    Accordingly, a security input that is normally required to bypass the
security wall is not required for access to public functionality on the computing device.      The
determination of whether particular functionality in the computing device is public or private can
be based on various factors including a designation received from a user or a context of the
computing device. Further, other inputs different from the security input may still be required
for access to public functionality.
[0023]          FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an example mobile device 100. The mobile device
100 can be, for example, a handheld computer, a personal digital assistant, a cellular telephone, a
network appliance, a camera, a smart phone, an enhanced general packet radio service (EGPRS)
mobile phone, a network base station, a media player, a navigation device, an email device, a
game console, or other electronic device or a combination of any two or more of these data
processing devices or other data processing devices.      Although the description below refers
generally to mobile device 100, any computing device, including a personal computer, laptop, or
tablet, may be used in accordance with the features described in the present disclosure.
                                     Mobile Device Overview
[0024]          In some implementations, the mobile device 100 includes a touch-sensitive
display 102.     The touch-sensitive display 102 can implement liquid crystal display (LCD)
                                                 8

1002000765
technology, light emitting polymer display (LPD) technology, or some other display technology.
The touch-sensitive display 102 can be sensitive to haptic and/or tactile contact with a user.
[0025]          In some implementations, the touch-sensitive display 102 can comprise a multi
touch-sensitive display 102.     A multi-touch-sensitive display 102 can, for example, process
multiple simultaneous touch points, including processing data related to the pressure, degree
and/or position of each touch point. Such processing facilitates gestures and interactions with
multiple fingers, chording, and other interactions. Other touch-sensitive display technologies can
also be used, e.g., a display in which contact is made using a stylus or other pointing device. An
example of a multi-touch-sensitive display technology is described in U.S. Patent Nos.
6,323,846; 6,570,557; 6,677,932; and U.S. Patent Publication No. 2002/0015024A1, each of
which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.
[0026]          In some implementations, the mobile device 100 can display one or more
graphical user interfaces on the touch-sensitive display 102 for providing the user access to
various system objects and for conveying information to the user. In some implementations, the
graphical user interface can include one or more display objects 104, 106. Each of the display
objects 104, 106 can be a graphic representation of a system object. Some examples of system
objects include device functions, applications, windows, files, alerts, events, or other identifiable
system objects.
                                Example Mobile Device Functionality
[00271          In some implementations, the mobile device 100 can implement multiple device
functionalities, such as a telephony device, as indicated by a phone object 110; an e-mail device,
as indicated by the e-mail object 112; a network data communication device, as indicated by the
Web object 114; a Wi-Fi base station device (not shown); and a media processing device, as
                                                  9

1002000765
indicated by the media player object 116. In some implementations, particular device objects
104, e.g., the phone object 110, the e-mail object 112, the Web object 114, and the media player
object 116, can be displayed in a menu bar 118. In some implementations, each of the device
functionalities can be accessed from a top-level graphical user interface, such as the graphical
user interface illustrated in FIG. 1. The objects 110, 112, 114 and 116 represent visual indicators
of applications on the mobile device 100. Touching one of the objects 110, 112, 114 or 116 can,
for example, invoke the corresponding functionality.
[0028]          In some implementations, the mobile device           100 can implement network
distribution functionality. For example, the functionality can enable the user to take the mobile
device 100 and its associated network while traveling. In particular, the mobile device 100 can
extend Internet access (e.g., via Wi-Fi) to other wireless devices in the vicinity. For example,
mobile device 100 can be configured as a base station for one or more devices. As such, mobile
device 100 can grant or deny network access to other wireless devices.
[0029]          In some implementations, upon invocation of particular device functionality, the
graphical user interface of the mobile device 100 changes, or is augmented or replaced with
another user interface or user interface elements, to facilitate user access to particular functions
associated with the corresponding device functionality.       For example, in response to a user
touching the phone object 110, the graphical user interface of the touch-sensitive display 102
may present display objects related to various phone functions; likewise, touching of the email
object 112 may cause the graphical user interface to present display objects related to various e
mail functions; touching the Web object 114 may cause the graphical user interface to present
display objects related to various Web-surfing functions; and touching the media player object
                                                 10

1002000765
116 may cause the graphical user interface to present display objects related to various media
processing functions.
[0030]         In some implementations, the top-level graphical user interface environment or
state of FIG. 1 can be restored by pressing a button 120 located near the bottom of the mobile
device 100.    In some implementations, each corresponding device functionality may have
corresponding "home" display objects displayed on the touch-sensitive display 102, and the
graphical user interface environment of FIG. 1 can be restored by pressing the "home" display
object.
[00311         In some implementations, the top-level graphical user interface can include
additional display objects 106, such as a short messaging service (SMS) object 130, a calendar
object 132, a photos object 134, a camera object 136, a calculator object 138, a stocks object 140,
a weather object 142, a maps object 144, a notes object 146, a clock object 148, an address book
object 150, and a settings object 152. Touching the SMS display object 130 can, for example,
invoke an SMS messaging environment and supporting functionality. Likewise, each selection
of a display object 132, 134, 136, 138, 140, 142, 144, 146, 148, 150 and 152 can invoke a
corresponding object environment and functionality.
[0032]         Additional and/or different display objects can also be displayed in the graphical
user interface of FIG. 1. For example, if the device 100 is functioning as a base station for other
devices, one or more "connection" objects may appear in the graphical user interface to indicate
the connection. In some implementations, the display objects 106 can be configured by a user,
e.g., a user may specify which display objects 106 are displayed, and/or may download
additional applications or other software that provides other functionalities and corresponding
display objects.

1002000765
[00331          In some implementations, the mobile device 100 can include one or more
input/output (1/0) devices and/or sensor devices. For example, a speaker 160 and a microphone
162 can be included to facilitate voice-enabled functionalities, such as phone and voice mail
functions. In some implementations, a loud speaker 164 can be included to facilitate hands-free
voice functionalities, such as speaker phone functions. An audio jack 166 can also be included
for use of headphones and/or a microphone.
[0034]          In some implementations, a proximity sensor 168 can be included to facilitate the
detection of the user positioning the mobile device 100 proximate to the user's ear and, in
response, to disengage the touch-sensitive display 102 to prevent accidental function invocations.
In some implementations, the touch-sensitive display 102 can be turned off to conserve
additional power when the mobile device 100 is proximate to the user's ear.
[00351          Other sensors can also be used.       For example, in some implementations, an
ambient light sensor 170 can be utilized to facilitate adjusting the brightness of the touch
sensitive display 102. In some implementations, an accelerometer 172 can be utilized to detect
movement of the mobile device 100, as indicated by the directional arrow 174. Accordingly,
display objects and/or media can be presented according to a detected orientation, e.g., portrait or
landscape. In some implementations, the mobile device 100 may include circuitry and sensors
for supporting a location determining capability, such as that provided by the global positioning
system (GPS) or other positioning system (e.g., systems using Wi-Fi access points, television
signals, cellular grids, Uniform Resource Locators (URLs)).           In some implementations, a
positioning system (e.g., a GPS receiver) can be integrated into the mobile device 100 or
provided as a separate device that can be coupled to the mobile device 100 through an interface
(e.g., port device 190) to provide access to location-based services.
                                                  12

1002000765
[00361          The mobile device 100 can also include a camera lens and sensor 180. In some
implementations, the camera lens and sensor 180 can be located on the back surface of the
mobile device 100. The camera can capture still images and/or video.
[00371          The mobile device 100 can also include one or more wireless communication
subsystems,    such as a 802.llb/g       communication    device  186, and/or a BluetoothTM
communication device 188. Other communication protocols can also be supported, including
other 802.x communication protocols (e.g., WiMax, Wi-Fi), code division multiple access
(CDMA), global system for mobile communications (GSM), Enhanced Data GSM Environment
(EDGE), 3G (e.g., EV-DO, UMTS, HSDPA), etc.
[00381          In some implementations, a port device 190, e.g., a Universal Serial Bus (USB)
port, or a docking port, or some other wired port connection, can be included. The port device
190 can, for example, be utilized to establish a wired connection to other computing devices,
such as other communication devices 100, a personal computer, a printer, or other processing
devices capable of receiving and/or transmitting data. In some implementations, the port device
190 allows the mobile device 100 to synchronize with a host device using one or more protocols.
                                 Network OperatingEnvironment
[00391          FIG. 2 is a block diagram of an example network operating environment 200 for
the mobile device 100 of FIG. 1.        The mobile device 100 of FIG. 1 can, for example,
communicate over one or more wired and/or wireless networks 210 in data communication. For
example, a wireless network 212, e.g., a cellular network, can communicate with a wide area
network (WAN) 214, such as the Internet, by use of a gateway 216. Likewise, an access point
218, such as an 802.11 g wireless access point, can provide communication access to the wide
                                                13

1002000765
area network 214.     In some implementations, both voice and data communications can be
established over the wireless network 212 and the access point 218. For example, the mobile
device 100a can place and receive phone calls (e.g., using VoIP protocols), send and receive e
mail messages (e.g., using POP3 protocol), and retrieve electronic documents and/or streams,
such as web pages, photographs, and videos, over the wireless network 212, gateway 216, and
wide area network 214 (e.g., using TCP/IP or UDP protocols). Likewise, the mobile device 100b
can place and receive phone calls, send and receive e-mail messages, and retrieve electronic
documents over the access point 218 and the wide area network 214. In some implementations,
the mobile device 100 can be physically connected to the access point 218 using one or more
cables and the access point 218 can be a personal computer. In this configuration, the mobile
device 100 can be referred to as a "tethered" device.
[0040]          The mobile devices 100a and 100b can also establish communications by other
means. For example, the wireless device 100a can communicate with other wireless devices,
e.g., other wireless devices 100, cell phones, etc., over the wireless network 212. Likewise, the
mobile devices 100a and 100b can establish peer-to-peer communications 220, e.g., a personal
area network, by use of one or more communication subsystems, such as the BluetoothTM
communication device 188 shown in FIG. 1. Other communication protocols and topologies can
also be implemented.
[0041]          The mobile device 100 can, for example, communicate with one or more services
230, 240, 250, 255, and 260 and/or one or more content publishers 270 over the one or more
wired and/or wireless networks 210.        For example, a navigation service 230 can provide
navigation information, e.g., map information, location information, route information, and other
information, to the mobile device 100. In the example shown, a user of the mobile device 100b
                                                 14

1002000765
has invoked a map functionality, e.g., by touching the maps object 144 on the top-level graphical
user interface shown in FIG. 1, and has requested and received a map for the location "1 Infinite
Loop, Cupertino, CA."
[0042]          A messaging service 240 can, for example, provide e-mail and/or other messaging
services. A media service 250 can, for example, provide access to media files, such as song files,
movie files, video clips, and other media data. A location-based service 255 can, for example,
provide data or content based on a current location of the mobile device 100. One or more other
services 260 can also be utilized by the mobile device 100, including a syncing service, an
activation service and a software update service that automatically determines whether software
updates are available for software on the mobile device 100, then downloads the software
updates to the mobile device 100 where the updates can be manually or automatically unpacked
and/or installed.
[0043]          The mobile device 100 can also access other data over the one or more wired
and/or wireless networks 210. For example, content publishers 270, such as news sites, RSS
feeds, web sites, blogs, social networking sites, developer networks, etc., can be accessed by the
mobile device 100. Such access can be provided by invocation of a web browsing function or
application (e.g., a browser) in response to a user touching the Web object 114.
                       Exemplary Display of Public and Private Applications
[0044]          FIGS. 3A-3E depict example displays of providing different levels of access to
different applications on a computing device. Computing devices generally can be configured to
implement a security wall to restrict unwanted or accidental access to functionality provided by
the computing devices. FIG. 3A illustrates implementation of an example security measure for
                                                 15

1002000765
restricting access to applications on a mobile device 300. The mobile device 300 can enter a
"stand-by" or "locked" mode as depicted in FIG. 3A. In a stand-by mode, mobile device 300 can
enforce a security wall to prohibit access to functionality, applications, and information usually
provided by the mobile device 300. In some instances, limited features can be presented during a
stand-by mode of the mobile device 300, such as a current time and date, an indicator of
remaining battery life, or a cellular reception signal strength.      The remaining functionality
provided by mobile device 300, however, can be restricted until a security input is received by
the mobile device 300.
[0045]          Mobile device 300 can require different security inputs before a user is given
access to functionality of the mobile device 300. In FIG. 3A, a sliding motion performed by a
user in contact with the touch-sensitive display 302 can trigger unlocking of the mobile device
300. In general, the sliding motion input prevents accidental unlocking of the mobile device 300.
A different input can also be required to unlock the mobile device 300, such as entering a
security code, as depicted in FIG. 3B. This prevents users who do not have permission to access
applications on the mobile device 300 from gaining access to applications.
[00461          In some instances, an owner of the mobile device 300 may be indifferent to
unwanted access to certain applications on the mobile device 300.            For example, certain
applications may not contain any personal information that the owner wishes to keep private. In
addition, the owner may prefer easy access to some applications and may be willing to risk
unwanted access to those applications even if personal information is accessible through the
applications.  Universal application of a security wall as depicted in FIGS. 3A and 3B to all
applications on the mobile device 300, however, may slow the owner from accessing certain
applications due to the additional security inputs required.
                                                 16

1002000765
[00471          FIG. 3C illustrates a display of applications available to a user on the mobile
device 300 without requiring a security input from the user. The applications available to the
user are represented in the display 302 as display objects 330, 332, 338, 340, 342, 344, 346, and
348. The display objects in FIG. 3C are presented in a "public mode" of the mobile device 300.
In public mode, the mobile device 300 may present only objects of applications designated as
public and allow access to those applications without enforcing a security wall with respect to
those applications.   In contrast, in private mode, the mobile device 300 may require security
inputs such as those depicted in FIGS. 3A and 3B before allowing access to applications
designated for private functionality.      In some instances, applications designated for public
functionality are accessible in both a public mode and a private mode. Further, during public
mode, the mobile device 300 may present only a subset of all applications designated for public
access at a time.     Different groups of public applications may be presented in the display
depending on the context. Touching one of the objects 330, 332, 338, 340, 342, 344, 346, or 348
displayed in public mode can invoke the corresponding functionality associated with the display
object without first entering a security input such as described in relation to FIGS. 3A or 3B.
[0048]           Various inputs can trigger a public mode of the mobile device 300 and switch the
mobile device 300 from standby mode to public mode. For example, a predefined sequence of
multiple inputs associated with a tactile button 384 on the mobile device 300 may trigger the
public mode of the mobile device 300, such as two presses of the button 384 in quick succession
or pressing the button 384 in a particular pattern.
[0049]          In some implementations, the tactile button 384 may be associated with receiving
input for a functionality of the mobile device 300 other than triggering a public mode of the
mobile device 300. For example, tactile button 384 can be associated with receiving input for
                                                  17

1002000765
changing a volume of a speaker on the mobile device 300 or for switching the mobile device 300
into a standby mode. In other words, tactile button 384 can be used to enter particular inputs to
trigger a public mode of the mobile device 300 as well as other functions of the mobile device
300.    In some examples, dual buttons used for increasing and decreasing the volume of the
mobile device 300 can also be used to trigger a public mode of the mobile device 300. For
example, a particular combination of inputs for increasing and/or decreasing the volume may
trigger the public mode such as two presses of the "volume up" button followed immediately by
one press of the "volume down" button. In other instances, specific inputs on the touch-sensitive
display 302 of mobile device 300 may switch the mobile device 300 into public mode. Other
inputs for triggering activation of the public mode of mobile device 300 are also within the scope
of the present disclosure.
[0050]          In some implementations, the applications are designated for public access based
on user selection. For example, the user can select individual applications for public access by
designating certain applications provided by the mobile device 300 as public applications.
Selected applications can then be made available to the user in a public mode of the mobile
device 300 without entering a security code. In certain instances, an application developer can
designate applications for private or public functionality. For example, the application developer
can tag a particular application as public or private during development of the application, or the
developer or a user may specify the application as public or private through an application
programming interface (API) of the operating system on mobile device 300.                 In some
implementations, the developer can create an application for distribution through an online store,
for example, and the designation of the application as public or private can be published in the
online store to notify potential users of the developer's designation. Different aspects of the
                                                  18

1002000765
same application can be designated as public or private, such as described below in relation to
FIG. 3E.
[0051]          In some instances, the mobile device 300 may support different modes in which
some modes automatically designate certain applications as public based on a particular context
associated with the mobile device 300 or a user of the mobile device 300.              For example,
applications may be automatically designated as public based on how recently an application was
used. Further, among public applications, the public applications displayed in the display area
302 of the mobile device 300 may be determined based on when the application was previously
used. The designation or display of applications in public mode can also be based on other
factors such as frequency of use of a particular application or a type of application. For example,
applications having personal information, such as an address book application or an online
banking application, may be designated for private access to protect against unwanted access
whereas certain applications, such as a music player or a computer game, may be designated for
public access because a user is likely to be indifferent to public access to those types of
applications.
[0052]          Designation of applications can also be based on a context associated with the
mobile device. In some implementations, applications associated with a particular context are
grouped and displayed together in a public mode of the mobile device 300. FIG. 3D illustrates
an example implementation in which certain applications are grouped together and displayed to a
user based on a geographic location of the mobile device 300. For example, the mobile device
may include a navigation system or other feature that can determine a particular current location
of the mobile device. In some implementations, the mobile device 300 determines its current
location using GPS or any other positioning system. In some implementations, the current
                                                 19

1002000765
location, as determined using GPS, can be expressed in latitude/longitude.                In some
implementations, the mobile device 300 can, optionally, convert the latitude/longitude of the
current location to an address (e.g., street, city, country) by referencing a database of
latitudes/longitudes and locations that is stored in memory, for example. The mobile device 300
can obtain its geographic position by other means as well. For example, a mobile device 300 can
obtain its position using cellular phone tower triangulation, Wi-Fi positioning, a combination of
GPS and other signals, differential GPS, and any other suitable technologies and techniques.
[0053]          The mobile device can automatically designate applications that are likely to be
used given the particular current location. For example, if a navigation system of the mobile
device 300 determines that the user is located in a particular foreign country based on the
location of the mobile device 300, applications that are helpful to the user may be automatically
designated as public applications and displayed in a public mode of the mobile device 300, as
illustrated in FIG. 3D.      In the illustrated example, objects associated with a translation
application 346, a currency converter application 348, and a weather application 330 are
displayed in a public mode of the mobile device 300.            The user may view and access
functionality associated with the displayed applications without entering a security code.
[0054]          In another example, the mobile device 300 may determine a particular activity
currently performed by the user based on relative motion of the mobile device at a particular
time. The accelerometer 372 of the mobile device 300 may be used to detect movement of the
mobile device 300, allowing determination of the current activity of the user based on
distinguishing characteristics of the movement. If the motion of the mobile device 300 indicates
that the user is running, for example, applications related to recreational running may be
                                                 20

1002000765
automatically designated as public applications and displayed in the mobile device 300 in public
mode.
[0055]          Applications can be grouped based on other contexts associated with certain
applications or with the mobile device 300. For example, applications may be designated for
public functionality and grouped together for display in a public mode of the mobile device 300
based on a current date or time of day.      Applications associated with tasks performed in the
morning, such as daily news, weather, traffic, or radio, are automatically grouped together and
displayed in a public mode of the mobile device 300 during morning hours. Other applications
may be designated for public functionality during other times of the day depending on the
application function. In some implementations, the designation and grouping of applications can
be connected with a calendar application on the mobile device 300. Accordingly, applications
associated with imminent deadlines, events, or holidays, for example, can be automatically
designated for public functionality as a particular calendar date draws near.
[0056]          The automatic designations of applications can be dynamic. In certain instances,
an application can be designated for public functionality, but the designation of the application
may automatically change over time or as a particular context changes. For example, frequent
use of a particular application may automatically trigger designation of the application for public
functionality. After a period of time, the application may be used less frequently, and after a
certain time has passed, the application may automatically be designated for private
functionality.
[00571          FIG. 3E illustrates display of a particular function of an application that has been
designated for public access.     In some implementations, particular features or portions of an
application may be designated for public access while remaining portions remain designated for
                                                  21

1002000765
private access.   For example, an e-mail application may be designated for private access in
general, but a specific function in the e-mail application, such as a calendar feature associated
with the e-mail application or the ability to read e-mails, may be available for public access. In
some instances, certain less-sensitive features in an application can be designated for public
functionality.   Features that are generally regarded as more important can be designated for
public functionality. As illustrated in FIG. 3E, in an address book 330 of the mobile device 300,
certain contacts may be publicly accessible, such as an emergency number 334 or a personal
home number 332. The remaining contacts in the address book 330, however, remain designated
for private functionality and are only accessible after input of a security code.
[0058]          In another example, a camera application on the mobile device 300 can generally
take pictures and present photos taken using the camera application to a user.         The camera
application can have certain functionality designated for public access, such as permitting a user
to take pictures in public mode but only allowing review of pictures that were taken in public
mode. The review of other pictures in the camera application can be restricted to private access.
In some implementations, functionality associated with purchases within an application can be
automatically designated for private access.      For example, a video game application on the
mobile device 300 can allow a user to make in-game purchases, such as purchases for additional
lives or coins within the game. The in-game purchasing functionality can be restricted to private
access such that a user of mobile device 300 in public mode can play the video game application
but is prohibited from making purchases within the game unless the user enters a private mode of
the mobile device 300.

       Exemplary Processesfor Designatingand DisplayingPublic and PrivateApplications
[0059]         FIG. 4 is a flow diagram of an exemplary process 400 for designating and
displaying public and private applications.     In the exemplary process 400, an application is
designated for private or public functionality (402). The designation of an application for public
or private functionality may be based on user input or automatically determined based on a
context or application type associated with the application. Certain types of applications may be
designated for public functionality.   In some instances, certain applications are designated for
public functionality based on frequency of use. A security wall is enforced for the application if
the application is designated as private (404). Users may be required to input a security code in
order to access the functionality of applications designated as private. Access to the application
is provided if the application is designated as public (406).      Users may be given access to
applications designated as public without entering the security code.
[0060]         FIG. 5 is a flow diagram of an exemplary process 500 for determining a group of
applications for display on a device. In the exemplary process 500, public applications on the
device are identified (502).    The public applications are grouped based on association with
different contexts (504). A context may be any factor associated with the applications or with
the device executing the applications that is shared among certain applications.     Examples of
contexts may be geographic location, type of application, current activity associated with a user
of the device executing the applications, demographic or personal information associated with
the user, or other attributes that may be associated with different applications on a device.
Accordingly, applications that are associated with the same context may be grouped together.
                                                 23

1002000765
[00611          A request for display of public applications is received (506).          A context
associated with a user of the device is determined (508).         The determination of the context
associated with the user may include determining a geographic location of the user or a current
activity of the user based on various signals received on the device. A particular group of public
applications is generated for display based on the context (510).
[0062]          The above processes are merely examples. Various combinations of the above
processes are possible.
                                    Exemplary Device Architecture
[0063]          FIG. 6 is a block diagram 600 of an example implementation of the mobile device
100 of FIG. 1. The mobile device 100 can include a memory interface 602 one or more data
processors, image processors and/or central processing units 604, and a peripherals interface 606.
The memory interface 602, the one or more processors 604 and/or the peripherals interface 606
can be separate components or can be integrated in one or more integrated circuits. The various
components in the mobile device 100 can be coupled by one or more communication buses or
signal lines.
[0064]           Sensors, devices and subsystems can be coupled to the peripherals interface 606
to facilitate multiple functionalities. For example, a motion sensor 610, a light sensor 612, and a
proximity sensor 614 can be coupled to the peripherals interface 606 to facilitate the orientation,
lighting and proximity functions described with respect to FIG. 1. Other sensors 616 can also be
connected to the peripherals interface 606, such as a GPS receiver, a temperature sensor, a
biometric sensor, or other sensing device, to facilitate related functionalities.
                                                 24

1002000765
[00651           A camera subsystem 620 and an optical sensor 622, e.g., a charged coupled
device (CCD) or a complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) optical sensor, can be
utilized to facilitate camera functions, such as recording photographs and video clips.
[0066]           Communication functions can be facilitated through one or more wireless
communication subsystems 624, which can include radio frequency receivers and transmitters
and/or optical (e.g., infrared) receivers and transmitters. The specific design and implementation
of the communication subsystem 624 can depend on the communication network(s) over which
the mobile device 100 is intended to operate. For example, a mobile device 100 may include
communication subsystems 624 designed to operate over a GSM network, a GPRS network, an
EDGE network, a 3G or 4G network, a Wi-Fi or WiMax network, and a BluetoothTM network.
In particular, the wireless communication subsystems 624 may include hosting protocols such
that the device 100 may be configured as a base station for other wireless devices.
[00671           An audio subsystem 626 can be coupled to a speaker 628 and a microphone 630
to facilitate voice-enabled functions, such as voice recognition, voice replication, digital
recording, and telephony functions.
[00681           The I/O subsystem 640 can include a touch screen controller 642 and/or other
input controller(s) 644. The touch-screen controller 642 can be coupled to a touch screen 646.
The touch screen 646 and touch screen controller 642 can, for example, detect contact and
movement or break thereof using any of a plurality of touch sensitivity technologies, including
but not limited to capacitive, resistive, infrared, and surface acoustic wave technologies, as well
as other proximity sensor arrays or other elements for determining one or more points of contact
with the touch screen 646.
                                                  25

1002000765
[00691          The other input controller(s) 644 can be coupled to other input/control devices
648, such as one or more buttons, rocker switches, thumb-wheel, infrared port, USB port, and/or
a pointer device such as a stylus. The one or more buttons (not shown) can include an up/down
button for volume control of the speaker 628 and/or the microphone 630.
[00701          In one implementation, a pressing of the button for a first duration may disengage
a lock of the touch screen 646; and a pressing of the button for a second duration that is longer
than the first duration may turn power to the mobile device 100 on or off. The user may be able
to customize a functionality of one or more of the buttons.       The touch screen 646 can, for
example, also be used to implement virtual or soft buttons and/or a keyboard.
[00711          In some implementations, the mobile device 100 can present recorded audio
and/or video files, such as MP3, AAC, and MPEG files. In some implementations, the mobile
device 100 can include the functionality of an MP3 player, such as an iPodTM.          The mobile
device 100 may, therefore, include a 36-pin connector that is compatible with the iPod. Other
input/output and control devices can also be used.
[0072]          The memory interface 602 can be coupled to memory 650. The memory 650 can
include high-speed random access memory and/or non-volatile memory, such as one or more
magnetic disk storage devices, one or more optical storage devices, and/or flash memory (e.g.,
NAND, NOR). The memory 650 can store an operating system 652, such as Darwin, RTXC,
LINUX, UNIX, OS X, WINDOWS, or an embedded operating system such as VxWorks. The
operating system 652 may include instructions for handling basic system services and for
performing hardware dependent tasks.       In some implementations, the operating system 652
handles timekeeping tasks, including maintaining the date and time (e.g., a clock) on the mobile
                                                26

1002000765
device 100. In some implementations, the operating system 652 can be a kernel (e.g., UNIX
kernel).
[0073]          The memory 650 may also store communication instructions 654 to facilitate
communicating with one or more additional devices, one or more computers and/or one or more
servers.   The memory 650 may include graphical user interface instructions 656 to facilitate
graphic user interface processing; sensor processing instructions 658 to facilitate sensor-related
processing and functions; phone instructions 660 to facilitate phone-related processes and
functions; electronic messaging instructions 662 to facilitate electronic-messaging related
processes and functions; web browsing instructions 664 to facilitate web browsing-related
processes and functions; media processing instructions 666 to facilitate media processing-related
processes and functions; GPS/Navigation instructions 668 to facilitate GPS and navigation
related processes and instructions; camera instructions 670 to facilitate camera-related processes
and functions; other software instructions 672 to facilitate other related processes and functions;
and/or security instructions 674, together with graphical user interface instructions 656, to
implement the features and processes of FIGS. 1-5.
[0074]          The memory 650 can also store data, including but not limited to documents,
images, video files, audio files, and other data.
[00751          In some implementations, the mobile device 100 includes a positioning system
618.    In various implementations, the positioning system 618 can be provided by a separate
device coupled to the mobile device 100, or can be provided internal to the mobile device. In
some implementations, the positioning system 618 can employ positioning technology including
a GPS, a cellular grid, URIs or any other technology for determining the geographic location of a
device. In some implementations, the positioning system 618 can employ a service provided by
                                                  27

a positioning service such as, for example, SkyHook Wireless of Boston, MA, or Rosum
Corporation of Mountain View, CA. In other implementations, the positioning system 618 can
be provided by an accelerometer and a compass using dead reckoning techniques.               In such
implementations, the user can occasionally reset the positioning system by marking the mobile
device's presence at a known location (e.g., a landmark or intersection).             In still other
implementations, the user can enter a set of position coordinates (e.g., latitude, longitude) for the
mobile device. For example, the position coordinates can be typed into the phone (e.g., using a
virtual keyboard) or selected by touching a point on a map. Position coordinates can also be
acquired from another device (e.g., a car navigation system) by syncing or linking with the other
device. In other implementations, the positioning system 618 can be provided by using wireless
signal strength and one or more locations of known wireless signal sources to provide the current
location.   Wireless signal sources can include access points and/or cellular towers.          Other
techniques to determine a current location of the mobile device 100 can be used and other
configurations of the positioning system 618 are possible.
[00761          Each of the above identified instructions and applications can correspond to a set
of instructions for performing one or more functions described above. These instructions need
not be implemented as separate software programs, procedures or modules. The memory 650
can include additional instructions or fewer instructions. Furthermore, various functions of the
mobile device 100 may be implemented in hardware and/or in software, including in one or more
signal processing and/or application specific integrated circuits.
[00771          The disclosed and other embodiments and the functional operations described in
this specification can be implemented in digital electronic circuitry, or in computer software,
firmware, or hardware, including the structures disclosed in this specification and their structural
                                                 28

equivalents, or in combinations of one or more of them. The disclosed and other embodiments
can be implemented as one or more computer program products, i.e., one or more modules of
computer program instructions encoded on a computer-readable medium for execution by, or to
control the operation of, data processing apparatus. The computer-readable medium can be a
machine-readable storage device, a machine-readable storage substrate, a memory device, a
composition of matter effecting a machine-readable propagated signal, or a combination of one
or more them. The term "data processing apparatus" encompasses all apparatus, devices, and
machines for processing data, including by way of example a programmable processor, a
computer, or multiple processors or computers.         The apparatus can include, in addition to
hardware, code that creates an execution environment for the computer program in question, e.g.,
code that constitutes processor firmware, a protocol stack, a database management system, an
operating system, or a combination of one or more of them. A propagated signal is an artificially
generated signal, e.g., a machine-generated electrical, optical, or electromagnetic signal, that is
generated to encode information for transmission to suitable receiver apparatus.
[0078]          A computer program (also known as a program, software, software application,
script, or code) can be written in any form of programming language, including compiled or
interpreted languages, and it can be deployed in any form, including as a stand-alone program or
as a module, component, subroutine, or other unit suitable for use in a computing environment.
A computer program does not necessarily correspond to a file in a file system. A program can be
stored in a portion of a file that holds other programs or data (e.g., one or more scripts stored in a
markup language document), in a single file dedicated to the program in question, or in multiple
coordinated files (e.g., files that store one or more modules, sub-programs, or portions of code).
A computer program can be deployed to be executed on one computer or on multiple computers
                                                  29

that are located at one site or distributed across multiple sites and interconnected by a
communication network.
[00791          The processes and logic flows described in this specification can be performed by
one or more programmable processors executing one or more computer programs to perform
functions by operating on input data and generating output. The processes and logic flows can
also be performed by, and apparatus can also be implemented as, special purpose logic circuitry,
e.g., an FPGA (field programmable gate array) or an ASIC (application-specific integrated
circuit).
[0080]          Processors suitable for the execution of a computer program include, by way of
example, both general and special purpose microprocessors, and any one or more processors of
any kind of digital computer. Generally, a processor will receive instructions and data from a
read-only memory or a random access memory or both. The essential elements of a computer
are a processor for performing instructions and one or more memory devices for storing
instructions and data. Generally, a computer will also include, or be operatively coupled to
receive data from or transfer data to, or both, one or more mass storage devices for storing data,
e.g., magnetic, magneto-optical disks, or optical disks. However, a computer need not have such
devices. Computer-readable media suitable for storing computer program instructions and data
include all forms of non-volatile memory, media and memory devices, including by way of
example semiconductor memory devices, e.g., EPROM, EEPROM, and flash memory devices;
magnetic disks, e.g., internal hard disks or removable disks; magneto-optical disks; and
CD-ROM and DVD-ROM disks. The processor and the memory can be supplemented by, or
incorporated in, special purpose logic circuitry.

[00811          To provide for interaction with a user, the disclosed embodiments can be
implemented on a computer having a display device, e.g., a CRT (cathode ray tube) or LCD
(liquid crystal display) monitor, for displaying information to the user and a keyboard and a
pointing device, e.g., a mouse or a trackball, by which the user can provide input to the
computer. Other kinds of devices can be used to provide for interaction with a user as well; for
example, feedback provided to the user can be any form of sensory feedback, e.g., visual
feedback, auditory feedback, or tactile feedback; and input from the user can be received in any
form, including acoustic, speech, or tactile input.
[0082]          The disclosed embodiments can be implemented in a computing system that
includes a back-end component, e.g., as a data server, or that includes a middleware component,
e.g., an application server, or that includes a front-end component, e.g., a client computer having
a graphical user interface or a Web browser through which a user can interact with an
implementation of what is disclosed here, or any combination of one or more such back-end,
middleware, or front-end components. The components of the system can be interconnected by
any form or medium of digital data communication, e.g., a communication network. Examples
of communication networks include a local area network ("LAN") and a wide area network
("WAN"), e.g., the Internet.
[0083]          The computing system can include clients and servers. A client and server are
generally remote from each other and typically interact through a communication network. The
relationship of client and server arises by virtue of computer programs running on the respective
computers and having a client-server relationship to each other.
