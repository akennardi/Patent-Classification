Abstract
An overhead rolling door is disclosed, including a curtain and a roller. The curtain has an
upper edge attached to the roller and two side edges configured to move along vertical
guides. The door can move between a closed configuration and an open configuration,
where the curtain is rolled about the roller when the door is in the open configuration. The
curtain includes a sheet with a plurality of substantially planar sections separated by lateral
ridges that run from one side edge to the other side edge, wherein the width of the ridges is
less than the width of the planar sections. A spacing device is fitted to at least one of the
planar sections at each of the side edges, so that when the door is in the open configuration
the planar section to which the spacing devices are fitted does not contact any other
overlapping planar section.

TECHNICAL FIELD
[0001]                  The present invention generally relates to overhead rolling doors and methods
of manufacture thereof.
BACKGROUND
[0002]                  Overhead rolling doors are commonly used in residential and industrial
settings. They typically have a door curtain made from corrugated sheet metal which is
configured to be raised and lowered, the edges being constrained by guides.
[0003]                  As the curtain is raised towards an open position, it is rolled about a roller
located above the door opening. The corrugations in the door curtain run horizontally, so
that they provide strength to the door curtain while still allowing a degree of bending only
about a horizontal axis to permit the rolling.
[0004]                  Protective strips are provided along each edge of the curtain to provide smooth
travel within the guide. These strips also aid with rolling the curtain so as to avoid wear
over time from contact between overlapping portions of the curtain.
[0005]                  The reference in this specification to any prior publication (or information
derived from it), or to any matter which is known, is not, and should not be taken as, an
acknowledgement or admission or any form of suggestion that prior publication (or
information derived from it) or known matter forms part of the common general
knowledge in the field of endeavour to which this specification relates.
SUMMARY
[0006]                  According to one example aspect, there is provided an overhead rolling door,
comprising a curtain and a roller, the curtain having an upper edge attached to the roller
and two side edges configured to move along vertical guides so that the door can move
between a closed configuration and an open configuration, wherein the curtain is rolled

about the roller when the door is in the open configuration, the curtain comprising a sheet
with a plurality of substantially planar sections separated by lateral ridges that run from
one side edge to the other side edge, wherein the width of the ridges is less than the width
of the planar sections, and wherein a spacing device is fitted to at least one of the planar
sections at each of the side edges, so that when the door is in the open configuration the
planar section to which the spacing devices are fitted does not contact any other
overlapping planar section.
[00071                  In one form, an edge strip is attached to the sheet proximal to each edge of the
curtain and the spacing devices include a groove through which the edge strip is
positioned. Preferably, each spacing device comprises a body with two leg portions, the
groove being formed between the body and each leg portion.
[00081                  In another form, each leg portion comprises a tab projecting from an end
opposite the body, such that the spacing device is fitted to the edge of the sheet by
inserting the sheet to a space between the tab and the leg portion. In one example form, the
body, leg portion and tab together are substantially S-shaped when viewed in a direction
parallel to the edge of the curtain, such that the groove has an opening facing in a
substantially opposite direction to an opening of the space between the tab and the leg
portion.
[0009]                  In other particular, but non-limiting, example forms: the edge strip is attached
to the sheet at a location between the leg portions of at least some of the spacing devices;
and the edge strip is attached to the sheet at a location on either side of at least some of the
spacing devices.
[0010]                  In accordance with another optional embodiment, provided by way of example
only, an upper portion of the curtain has two spacing devices between each ridge at each
edge and a lower portion of the curtain has only one spacing device between each ridge at
each edge.
[0011]                  In other particular, but non-limiting, example forms: the spacing devices are
sized so that they are substantially hidden by the guides when the door is in the closed

equal to or less than 1:3; the ratio of the width of the ridges to the width of the planar
sections is equal to or less than 1:4; the ratio of the width of the ridges to the width of the
planar sections is equal to or less than 1:5; and each of the spacing devices is formed as a
single piece.
[0012]                  According to another example aspect, there is provided a method of
manufacturing a curtain for an overhead rolling door, comprising the steps of: forming
ridges in a sheet of material; fixing an edge strip along two edges of the sheet using staples
or other fasteners; and attaching a plurality of spacing devices to each of the edges by
inserting a leg of the spacing device between the edge strip and the sheet. Preferably, the
curtain is substantially as defined herein.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[00371                  The following modes, given by way of example only, are described in order to
provide a more precise understanding of the subject matter of a preferred embodiment or
embodiments.
[0038]                  In the Figures, incorporated to illustrate features of an example embodiment,
like reference numerals are used to identify like parts throughout the Figures.
[0039]                  Referring to Figure 1, a curtain 10 is shown from an overhead rolling door
according to an embodiment of the invention. The curtain 10 has an upper edge 12
attached to a roller 13. Two vertical side edges 14 are configured to move along vertical
guides so that the door can move between a closed configuration as shown, where a
majority of the curtain is substantially flat, and an open configuration. When the curtain 10
is in the open configuration, it is rolled about the roller 13.
[0040]                  Figure 2 shows the curtain 10 in a closed configuration. Typically, a seal 15 is
provided along a lower edge that abuts the ground when the door is in the closed
configuration.
[0041]                  Referring to Figure 3, the curtain 10 is made from a sheet 18 with a plurality of
substantially planar sections 20 separated by lateral ridges 21. The ridges 21 run from one
side edge 14 to the other side edge 14. A seam 22 may be visible also extending across the
curtain 10, however this primarily a visibly line only and does not affect the shape of the
curtain 10 to any important extent.
[0042]                  Figure 10 shows the profile of the sheet 18 in more detail. The ratio of the
width 25 of the ridges 21 to the width 26 of the planar sections 20 in the embodiment
shown is in the order of 1:4. In alternative embodiments of the invention, the planar
sections 20 may be narrower, so that the ratio is only about 1:3, but in yet other
embodiments the planar sections 20 may be even wider, so that the ratio is equal to or even
less than 1:5.
[0043]                  In contrast, prior art doors are typically manufactured with a relatively equal
width of planar sections and ridges, depending on the precise shape of the ridges and how

C:\Intrwoven\NRPortbl\DCC\KMII\5757043_Ldocx-8 06/2018
                                                        -6
the width is measured. That is, for prior art doors the width of the ridges is similar to the
width of the planar sections, as a result of the planar sections being far narrower. So the
embodiment shown in the Figures has planar sections that are at least double the width of
typical prior art doors, with similar sized ridges. Described in another way, prior art doors
have corrugations where the troughs are similar in size to the raised sections, while the
door curtain of the present invention has corrugations where the troughs are much wider
than the raised sections.
[0044]                  While such a change may appear minor, there are a number of practical reasons
why doors of such configuration have not been made before. Firstly, a common
manufacturing process for making the sheets is "roll forming". This process involves
passing a blank sheet through a series of sequential rollers, which gradually form the blank
sheet into the finished configuration. The rollers are shaped according to the desired final
profile of the door curtain. In such a process, adjusting the shape and/or spacing of the
ridges is not practical, due to the need to change the shape or move the position of the
rollers.
[0045]                  Overhead rolling doors are typically not bulk produced to a particular
specification, but rather involve specific production to customer requirements due to the
extensive options made available, such as colour, width and material. Most customers will
only require single or small numbers of doors, so providing options such as ridge shape or
ridge width may require continuously stopping the manufacturing process to adjust the
rolls used in the roll forming process.
[00461                  By changing the process to a continuous process, whereby a single ridge is
stamped at a time, this allows the spacing between ridges to be readily adjusted. This may
not appear to be a particular advantage, however by removing the issues described above it
makes the process practical in a mass production scenario where the specification for ridge
separation distance is changing regularly.
[00471                  During development of the present invention, however, it was found that
increasing the width of the planar sections too far can introduce problems with the
operation of the door. In particular, when the door is rolled on the roller when in the open

C:\Interwovn\NRPortbl\DCC\KMII\5757043_Ldocx-8 06 2018
                                                         -7
position, the greatly increased width of the planar sections can change the way the sheet
curves. In particular, the planar sections may not curve sufficiently and/or may deform
under the weight of subsequent wraps around the roller. As such, this may result in contact
between sections of the sheet that are laying over one another when rolled on the roller. In
such a case, protective strips provided along the edges of the curtain may not be enough to
prevent such contact.
[00481                  This may not immediately cause problems with operation of the door, however
after many cycles of opening and closing the door it can result in wear on the sections that
touch one another. Initially, this may cause visible signs of wear, such as discolouration,
and eventually this wear may increase to a more detrimental failure.
[0049]                  To ensure the curtain 10 rolls effectively despite being manufactured with
wider planar sections 20, spacing devices 30 are fitted to the planar sections 20 at each of
the side edges 14. This ensures that when the door is in the open configuration, the planar
section 20 to which the spacing devices 30 are fitted does not contact any other
overlapping planar section 20.
[0050]                  Referring to Figures 13 to 19, a spacing device 30 is shown in more detail. The
spacing device includes a body 32 with two leg portions 33. Together, the body 32 and leg
portions 33 are shaped to form a groove 35 between them, where this groove is in two
separate sections.
[0051]                  Each leg portion 33 also includes a tab 36 projecting from an end opposite the
body 32, so that when viewed from the end, as shown in Figure 16, the body 32, legs 33
and tabs 36 together are substantially S-shaped. This means that the groove 35 faces in a
substantially opposite direction to a space 37 between the tab 36 and the leg portion 33.
[0052]                  Preferably, each of the spacing devices 30 is formed as a single piece, such as
being moulded from plastic, for example. It will be appreciated, however, that many
different methods and/or alternative materials could be used for manufacturing the spacing
devices 30.

C:\Interwovn\NRPortbl\DCC\KMII\5757043_Ldocx-8 06 2018
                                                         -8
 [00531                 Referring to Figure 20, an edge strip 42 is attached to the sheet 18 proximal to
the edge 14 of the curtain 10. This edge strip 42 is fixed to the side of the sheet 18 from
which the ridges 21 protrude. Two staples 44 in each of the planar sections 20 fixes the
edge strip 42 to the sheet 18. Figure 21 shows that another edge strip 45 and metal strip 46
are also attached to the opposite side of the sheet 18.
 [0054]                 When the spacing device 30 is fitted to the edge 14 of the sheet 18, the edge
strip 42 is positioned in the groove 35 and the sheet 18 is positioned in the space 37, so that
the tabs 36 hook around to the opposite side of the sheet 18.
 [0055]                 The section of the curtain 10 that is shown in Figures 20 and 21 has two
spacing devices 30 on a single planar section 20. In this configuration, the edge strip 42
has the staples 44 located between the leg portions 33 of the spacing devices 30.
 [0056]                 Referring to Figures 22 and 23, a section of curtain 10 is shown that has only
one spacing device 30 on the planar section 20. In this configuration, the edge strip 42 has
the staples 44 located on either side of the spacing device 30.
 [00571                 Referring to Figure 3, an upper portion of the curtain 10 has two spacing
devices 30 between each ridge 21 at each edge 14 and a lower portion of the curtain 10 has
only one spacing device 30 between each ridge 21 at each edge 14. When the curtain 10 is
rolled, the upper portion is closer to the centre of the roller, and is therefore rolled to a
tighter radius.
[0058]                  In addition, the angle at which the curtain enters the generic door guides is
greater when the door is closer to the closed position, due to the smaller roller diameter.
This may cause single spacers toward the top of the curtain to "catch" when entering the
guides. Using two spacers in the planar sections at the top of the curtain can help to
prevent this catching at the end of the guide.
[0059]                  As such, the extra spacing devices 30 are used to ensure adequate curvature of
the planar sections 20 and smoother entry into the door guides. It also means that standard
door guides can be used without modification with the door curtain 10 of the present

C:\Interwovn\NRPortbl\DCC\KMII\5757043_Ldocx-8 06 2018
                                                         -9
invention. The lower portion is rolled to a larger radius, however, so a single spacing
device 30 per planar section 20 is sufficient.
[0060]                  The spacing devices 30 are sized so that they are substantially hidden by the
guides when the door is in the closed configuration. Therefore, the spacing devices 30
allow the wider planar sections 20 to be successfully used, yet still have the curtain 10 roll
in an effective manner, while not creating any negative visual impacts. That is, the spacing
devices 30 create adequate curvature and support across the width of the curtain 10 when
rolled, without needing to extend across the width of the curtain 10.
[00611                  Manufacturing the curtain 10 involves first forming the ridges 21 in the sheet
18. The edge strips 42, 45 are then fixed along the two edges 14 of the sheet 18 using the
staples 44 or other suitable fasteners. The spacing devices 30 are then attached to each of
the edges 14 by inserting the legs 33 of the spacing device 30 between the edge strip 42
and the sheet 18.
[0062]                  Once the legs 33 are inserted far enough, the tabs 36 hook over the edge of the
sheet 18. The tabs 36 then prevent the legs 33 from being slid back out from under the
edge strip 42. At the same time, however, the edge strip 42 sitting in the groove 35 of the
spacing device 30 stops it from being moved further past the edge 14 of the sheet 18. In
this way, the shape of the spacing device 30 together with the edge strip 42 and the sheet
18 allows the spacing device 30 to be firmly held in place without the need for directly
being fastened to the sheet 18 or edge strip 42.
[00631                  The spacing devices 30 are advantageous because they allow the curtain 10 to
roll effectively and without damage over time, without the need for any component to
extend across the curtain 10. This allows the significantly different appearance to be
achieved without compromising the lifespan of the curtain 10 to any significant degree.
[0064]                  Whilst the present invention has been described with reference to particular
embodiments, it will be understood that many modifications will be apparent to those
skilled in the art. All such variations and modifications should be considered to fall within
