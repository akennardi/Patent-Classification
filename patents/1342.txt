                                         ABSTRACT
       This invention relates to low sulfur marine bunker fuel compositions and methods of
making the same. The invention also relates to an uncracked, hydrotreated vacuum resid for use
in making the low sulfur marine bunker fuel composition.             Contrary to conventional
marine/bunker fuel compositions, the low sulfur marine/bunker fuel composition uses mostly
uncracked components, including a (cat feed) hydrotreated vacuum resid.        The low sulfur
marine/bunker fuel composition can also have reduced contents of residual components.

                        LOW SULFUR MARINE BUNKER FUELS AND
                                  METHODS OF MAKING SAME
FIELD
[0001]       This invention relates generally to methods for making marine bunker fuels having
relatively low sulfur content, as well as to the resulting low sulfur content fuel compositions made
according to such methods.
BACKGROUND
[0002]       As promulgated by the International Maritime Organization (IMO), issued as Revised
MARPOL Annex VI, marine fuels will be capped globally with increasingly more stringent
requirements on sulfur content. In addition, individual countries and regions are beginning to
restrict sulfur level used in ships in regions known as Emission Control Areas, or ECAs.
[0003]       The fuels used in global shipping are typically marine bunker fuels, for larger ships.
Bunker fuels are advantageous since they are less costly than other fuels; however, they are
typically composed of cracked and/or resid fuels and hence have higher sulfur levels. Meeting the
lower sulfur specs for marine vessels can be conventionally accomplished through the use of
distillates. However, distillate fuels typically trade at a high cost premium for a variety of reasons,
not the least of which is the utility in a variety of transport applications employing Compression
ignition engines. They are produced at low sulfur levels, typically significantly below the sulfur
levels specified in the IMO regulations.
[0004]       Those regulations specify, inter alia, a 1.0 wt% sulfur content on ECA Fuels (effective
July 2010) for residual or distillate fuels, a 3.5 wt% sulfur content cap (effective January 2012),
which can impact about 15% of the current residual fuel supply, a 0.1 wt% sulfur content on ECA
Fuels (effective January 2015), relating mainly to hydrotreated middle distillate fuel, and a 0.5
wt% sulfur content cap (circa 2020-2025), centered mainly on distillate fuel or distillate/residual
fuel mixtures. When the ECA sulfur limits and sulfur cap drops, various reactions may take place
to supply low sulfur fuels. The 0.1% Sulfur ECA fuel can be challenging to supply, since shippers
typically purchase lower sulfur fuel oils with properties suitable for marine applications, and at a
steep price discount to distillate fuels.
[0005]       Hydrotreaters in front of fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) units, commonly called CFHT,
typically hydroprocess petroleum gasoils and resids to sufficiently low sulfur levels such that the
product fuels are sufficient to be sold as fuel with no further treatment, or with minimal incremental
hydroprocessing.

                                                  -2
[0006]      It would be advantageous to utilize a fuel high energy content, low sulfur fuels in marine
applications, which fuels have conventionally included cracked distillates. Distillates can typically
command a much higher value than bunker fuels. An alternative low sulfur marine bunker fuel,
with the correct fuel quality characteristics, could command a high premium in the marketplace.
[0007]      Indeed, there are some publications that disclose the desirability of lowering the sulfur
content of marine bunker fuels. A non-exclusive list of such publications includes, for example,
U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,006,076, 4,420,388, 6,187,174, 6,447,671, and 7,651,605, U.S. Patent Application
Publication Nos. 2008/0093262 and 2013/0340323, PCT Publication Nos. WO 1999/057228 and
WO 2009/001314, British Patent No. GB 1209967, Russian Patent No. RU 2213125, Japanese
Patent No. JP 2006000726, and the following articles: Chem. & Tech. of Fuels and Oils (2005),

[0008]      Thus, it would be desirable to find compositions (and methods for making them) in
which hydrotreated and/or uncracked gasoil products could be used in marine bunker fuels, as
described with reference to the invention herein.
SUMMARY
[0009]      One aspect of the invention relates to a method for making a low sulfur marine bunker
fuel composition with a reduced concentration of components that have been cracked, the method
comprising: contacting a vacuum resid feed stream having at least about 2000 wppm, for example
at least about 2000 wppm, at least about 5000 wppm, at least about 7500, or at least about 10000
wppm sulfur, with a hydrogen-containing gas in the presence of a hydrotreating catalyst under
effective hydrotreating conditions in a catalytic feed hydrotreater, such that the product exhibits at
most about 5000 wppm, for example at most about 1500 wppm sulfur, a pour point of at least about
20'C, and a kinematic viscosity of at least about 350 cSt at 50'C, without the product being subject
to a substantial amount of cracking; and optionally blending at least a portion of the uncracked
product with 0-60 vol% of other components, selected from viscosity modifiers, pour point
depressants, lubricity modifiers, antioxidants, and combinations thereof, to form a marine bunker
fuel composition.    The resulting marine bunker fuel composition contains:         (1) the uncracked
product having at most about 2000 wppm, for example at most about 1500 wppm or at most about
1000 wppm sulfur; (2) no more than about 10 vol% of a first diesel boiling range hydrocarbon
stream having no more than about 20 wppm sulfur; and (3) no more than about 50 vol% of a second
diesel boiling range hydrocarbon stream having no more than about 10 wppm sulfur.

[0010]       Another aspect of the invention relates to a low sulfur marine bunker fuel composition
comprising:     40 vol% to 100 vol% of an uncracked, hydrotreated vacuum resid having at most
about 5000 wppm-for example at most about 2000 wppm, at most about 1500 wppm, or at most
about 1000 wppm-sulfur; and up to 60 vol% of other components, selected from viscosity
modifiers, pour point depressants, lubricity modifiers, antioxidants, and combinations thereof. The
low sulfur marine bunker fuel composition has: at most about 5000 wppm, for example at most
about 1000 wppm sulfur; and at least one of a kinematic viscosity at about 50'C from about 20 cSt
to about 400 cSt, a density at 15'C from about 800 kg/m3 to about 1000 kg/m 3 , and a pour point
from about 20'C to about 35'C.
[0011]       Another aspect of the invention relates to a low sulfur, uncracked, hydrotreated vacuum
resid having at most about 5000 wppm-for example at most about 2000 wppm, at most about
1500 wppm, or at most about 1000 wppm-sulfur, a T50 of at least 600'C, a pour point of at least
about 20'C, and a kinematic viscosity of at least around 100 cSt at 50'C.
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS
[0012]       Figure 1 shows a flow-chart outlining an exemplary process for making a low sulfur
bunker fuel from a vacuum resid feed stock as described herein.
DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0013]       In one aspect of the invention, a method is described for making a low sulfur marine
bunker fuel composition, while another aspect of the invention describes the low sulfur marine
bunker fuel composition so made.
[0014]       As used herein, the terms "marine bunker fuel", "bunker fuel", or "marine fuel" refer
to fuel compositions that (1) are suitable for use in ships' engines and (2) have at least 40 vol% of
a product of petroleum refining that is not distilled off in either an atmospheric or a vacuum
distillation column. Further, a "marine bunker fuel" as described herein is used in contradistinction
to "marine distillate fuel." A blend containing both distillate and heavier, non-distillate fuels may
still be designated a "bunker fuel" if the heavy, non-distillate components make up more than 40%
of the total volume of the blend.
Reduced Cracking
[0015]       Advantageously, and contrary to conventional practices, the present compositions and
methods focus on a reduced use/concentration of components that have been subject to a (refinery)
cracking process. As used herein, the terms "substantially uncracked" or "without substantial
cracking" should be understood to exclude processing the fuel by steps/stages whose primary or
significant focus is cracking (e.g., FCC processes, steam cracking processes, thermal cracking
processes such as visbreaking and/or coking, and the like, but typically not hydrocracking), but not

                                                   -4
to exclude steps/stages where cracking is a very minor focus or a side reaction (e.g., hydrotreating
processes, aromatic saturation processes, hydrofinishing processes, and the like). Without being
bound by theory, it is believed that reducing the amount of cracked stocks in a fuel composition
can have an advantage of improving oxidation stability and/or ignition quality of the fuel
composition (e.g., hydrocracked stocks can tend to be differentiatable from other cracked stocks
in that their quality, such as in oxidation stability and/or ignition quality, can tend to be acceptable
or even relatively high, perhaps due to the role that hydrogen plays in such cracking processes).
As a result, conventional cracked components of marine bunker fuels such as cycle oils (e.g., light
and heavy),     slurry oils (i.e., the FCC bottoms), and the like, can advantageously be
reduced/minimized or at least kept to a relatively low level.
Composition Sulfur Content
[0016]       The low sulfur marine bunker fuel composition can advantageously meet a stricter
standard than currently required for marine bunker fuels by having a maximum sulfur content of
5000 wppm, more restrictively 1500 wppm, more restrictively still 1200 wppm, or even more
restrictively 1000 wppm. Although sulfur content standards for fuels are not generally given a
minimum, it can often be desirable to be as close to the standard maximum as possible for any
number of reasons, which may include, without limitation, that stringent sulfur standards requiring
additional costly treatment can be reduced/minimized by allowing relatively high-sulfur, relatively
low-value streams to be incorporated into compositions where they otherwise might not negatively
affect the specifications. As such, in many embodiments meeting the more restrictive 1000 wppm
specification, the low sulfur marine bunker fuels, e.g., made according to the methods disclosed
herein, can exhibit a sulfur content between 900 wppm and 1000 wppm. Nevertheless, in other
embodiments meeting the more restrictive 1000 wppm specification, the low sulfur marine bunker
fuels, e.g., made according to the methods disclosed herein, can exhibit a sulfur content of less than
about 850 wppm, for example less than about 800 wppm, less than about 750 wppm, less than
about 700 wppm, less than about 650 wppm, less than about 600 wppm, less than about 550 wppm,
less than about 500 wppm, less than about 450 wppm, less than about 400 wppm, less than about
350 wppm, less than about 300 wppm, less than about 250 wppm, less than about 200 wppm, less
than about 150 wppm, less than about 100 wppm, less than about 75 wppm, less than about 50
wppm, less than about 30 wppm, less than about 20 wppm, less than about 15 wppm, less than
about 10 wppm, less than about 8 wppm, or less than about 5 wppm. Further, in other embodiments
meeting the 5000 wppm specification, the low sulfur marine bunker fuels, e.g., made according to
the methods disclosed herein, can exhibit a sulfur content of at most about 4900 wppm, for example
at most about 4800 wppm, at most about 4700 wppm, at most about 4600 wppm, at most about

about 15 wppm, at most about 10 wppm, at most about 8 wppm, or at most about 5 wppm.
[0017]      In such various other embodiments, the low sulfur marine bunker fuels, e.g., made
according to the methods disclosed herein, may additionally exhibit a sulfur content of at least
about 5 wppm, for example at least about 10 wppm, at least about 15 wppm, at least about 20
wppm, at least about 30 wppm, at least about 50 wppm, at least about 75 wppm, at least about 100
wppm, at least about 150 wppm, at least about 200 wppm, at least about 250 wppm, at least about
300 wppm, at least about 350 wppm, at least about 400 wppm, at least about 450 wppm, at least
about 500 wppm, at least about 550 wppm, at least about 600 wppm, at least about 650 wppm, at
least about 700 wppm, at least about 750 wppm, at least about 800 wppm, at least about 850 wppm,

wppm, at least about 4100 wppm, at least about 4200 wppm, at least about 4300 wppm, at least
about 4400 wppm, at least about 4500 wppm, at least about 4600 wppm, at least about 4700 wppm,
at least about 4800 wppm, or at least about 4900 wppm.
[0018]      Ranges expressly disclosed include combinations of the above-enumerated upper and
lower limits, e.g. 1000-500 wppm, 850-550 wppm, or 500-100 wppm.

Vacuum Resid Product
[0021]      One important component of the low sulfur marine bunker fuel compositions according
to the invention and/or made according to the methods disclosed herein is a substantially
uncracked, hydrotreated vacuum resid product, which represents a resid feed stream (e.g., a
vacuum resid) that has been (cat feed) hydrotreated through contact with a hydrogen-containing
gas in the presence of a hydrotreating catalyst under effective hydrotreating conditions (in a
catalytic feed hydrotreater reactor).    This substantially uncracked, hydrotreated vacuum resid
product is generally the effluent from a cat feed hydrotreater (CFHT), before being sent to a refinery
cracking unit (such as an FCC unit).
[0022]      In the present invention, the low sulfur marine bunker fuel composition, e.g., made
according to the methods disclosed herein, can be comprised of at least about 50 vol% of this
uncracked, hydrotreated vacuum resid product, for example at least about 50 vol%, at least about

the low sulfur marine bunker fuel composition, e.g., made according to the methods disclosed
herein, can be comprised of 100 vol% or less of this uncracked, hydrotreated vacuum resid product,
for example at most about 99.99 vol%, at most about 99.9 vol%, at most about 99 vol%, at most
about 98 vol%, at most about 97 vol%, at most about 95 vol%, at most about 90 vol%, at most

above-enumerated upper and lower limits, e.g. 50-99.99 vol%, 60-85 vol%, or 70-80 vol%.
[0023]      Prior to being hydrotreated, the vacuum resid stream can generally have a sulfur content
significantly higher than post-hydrotreatment.     For instance, the pre-hydrotreated vacuum resid
feed stream can have a sulfur content of at least about 2000 wppm, for example at least about 3000
wppm, at least about 5000 wppm, at least about 7500 wppm, at least about 1 wt%, at least about

required to boil at least [num] percent by weight of that composition. For example, the temperature
required to boil at least about 25 wt% of a feed is referred to herein as a "T25" boiling point. All
boiling temperatures used herein refer to the temperature at 1 atm pressure. The basic test method
of determining the boiling points or ranges of any feedstock, any fuel component, and/or any fuel
composition produced according to this invention, can be performed according to standardized test
method TP 480 and/or by batch distillation according to ASTM D86-09el.

about 60 vol%, or at least about 65 vol%. Examples of such other components can include, but
are not limited to, viscosity modifiers, pour point depressants, lubricity modifiers, antioxidants, and
combinations thereof. Other examples of such other components can include, but are not limited
to, distillate boiling range components such as straight-run atmospheric (fractionated) distillate
streams, straight-run vacuum (fractionated) distillate streams, hydrocracked distillate streams, and
the like, and combinations thereof.       Such distillate boiling range components can behave as
viscosity modifiers, as pour point depressants, as lubricity modifiers, as some combination thereof,
or even in some other functional capacity in the aforementioned low sulfur marine bunker fuel.
[0030]       Examples    of pour point depressants        can   include, but are      not limited to,
oligomers/copolymers of ethylene and one or more comonomers (such as those commercially
available from Infineum, e.g., of Linden, N.J.), which may optionally be modified post
polymerization to be at least partially functionalized (e.g., to exhibit oxygen-containing and/or
nitrogen-containing functional groups not native to each respective comonomer). Depending upon
the physico-chemical nature of the uncracked, hydrotreated vacuum resid product and/or the low
sulfur marine bunker fuel composition, e.g., made according to the methods disclosed herein, in
some embodiments, the oligomers/copolymers can have a number average molecular weight (M.)
of about 500 g/mol or greater, for example about 750 g/mol or greater, about 1000 g/mol or greater,
about 1500 g/mol or greater, about 2000 g/mol or greater, about 2500 g/mol or greater, about 3000
g/mol or greater, about 4000 g/mol or greater, about 5000 g/mol or greater, about 7500 g/mol or

g/mol or less, about 15000 g/mol or less, about 10000 g/mol or less, about 7500 g/mol or less,
about 5000 g/mol or less, about 4000 g/mol or less, about 3000 g/mol or less, about 2500 g/mol or
less, about 2000 g/mol or less, about 1500 g/mol or less, or about 1000 g/mol or less. The amount
of pour point depressants, when desired to be added to the low sulfur marine bunker fuel
composition, e.g., made according to the methods disclosed herein, can include any amount
effective to reduce the pour point to a desired level, such as within the general ranges described
hereinabove.
[0031]       In some embodiments, in addition to an uncracked, hydrotreated vacuum resid product,
the low sulfur marine bunker fuel, e.g., made according to the methods disclosed herein, can
comprise up to 15 vol% (for example, up to 10 vol%, up to 7.5 vol%, or up to 5 vol%; additionally
or alternately, at least about 1 vol%, for example at least about 3 vol%, at least about 5 vol%, at
least about 7.5 vol%, or at least about 10 vol%) of slurry oil, fractionated (but otherwise untreated)
crude oil, or a combination thereof.

                                                  - 15
[0032]        In some embodiments, up to about 50 vol% of the low sulfur marine bunker fuel
composition can be diesel additives. These diesel additives can be cracked or uncracked, or can
be a blend of cracked and uncracked diesel fuels. In particular embodiments, the diesel additives
can include a first diesel additive and a second diesel additive, also described herein as a "first
diesel boiling hydrocarbon stream" and a "second diesel boiling hydrocarbon stream." Diesel fuels
typically boil in the range of about 180'C to about 360'C.
[0033]        The first diesel additive can be a low-sulfur, hydrotreated diesel additive, having no
more than 30 wppm sulfur, for example no more than about 25 wppm, no more than about 20
wppm, no more than about 15 wppm, no more than about 10 wppm, or no more than about 5 wppm
sulfur. In some embodiments, the first diesel additive can provide up to about 40 vol% of the total
fuel composition, for example up to about 35 vol%, up to about 30 vol%, up to about 25 vol%, up
to about 20 vol%, up to about 15 vol%, up to about 10 vol%, or up to about 5 vol%.
[0034]        The second diesel additive can be a low-sulfur, hydrotreated diesel additive, having no
more than 20 wppm sulfur, for example no more than about 15 wppm, no more than about 10
wppm, no more than about 5 wppm, no more than about 3 wppm, or no more than about 2 wppm
sulfur. In some embodiments, the second diesel additive can provide up to about 50 vol% of the
total fuel composition, for example up to about 45 vol%, up to about 40 vol%, up to about 35 vol%,
up to about 30 vol%, up to about 25 vol%, up to about 20 vol%, up to about 15 vol%, up to about
10 vol%, or up to about 5 vol%.
Hydrotreating a Vacuum Resid Feed Stream
[0035]        The (cat feed) hydrotreatment of the vacuum resid feed stream to attain the uncracked,
hydrotreated vacuum resid product can be accomplished in any suitable reactor or combination of
reactors in a single stage or in multiple stages.       This hydrotreatment step typically includes
exposure of the feed stream to a hydrotreating catalyst under effective hydrotreating conditions.
The hydrotreating catalyst can comprise any suitable hydrotreating catalyst, e.g., a catalyst
comprising at least one Group VIII metal (for example selected from Ni, Co, and a combination
thereof) and at least one Group VIB metal (for example selected from Mo, W, and a combination
thereof), optionally including a suitable support and/or filler material (e.g., comprising alumina,
silica, titania, zirconia, or a combination thereof). The Group VIII metal of a hydrotreating catalyst
can be present in an amount ranging from about 0.1 wt % to about 20 wt %, for example from
about 1 wt % to about 12 wt %. The Group VIB metal can be present in an amount ranging from
about 1 wt % to about 50 wt %, for example from about 2 wt % to about 20 wt % or from about 5
wt% to about 30 wt%. The hydrotreating catalyst according to aspects of this invention can be a
bulk catalyst or a supported catalyst. All weight percents of metals are given in oxide form on

                                                 - 16
support. By "on support" is meant that the percents are based on the weight of the support. For
example, if the support were to weigh 100 grams, then 20 wt % Group VIII metal would mean that
20 grams of Group VIII metal oxide is on the support. It is within the scope of the present invention
that more than one type of hydrotreating catalyst be used in the same reaction vessel.
[0036]      Techniques for producing supported catalysts are well known in the art. Techniques
for producing bulk metal catalyst particles are known and have been previously described, for
example in U.S. Pat. No. 6,162,350, which is hereby incorporated by reference. Bulk metal catalyst
particles can be made via methods where all of the metal catalyst precursors are in solution, or via
methods where at least one of the precursors is in at least partly in solid form, optionally but
preferably while at least another one of the precursors is provided only in a solution form.
Providing a metal precursor at least partly in solid form can be achieved, for example, by providing
a solution of the metal precursor that also includes solid and/or precipitated metal in the solution,
such as in the form of suspended particles. By way of illustration, some examples of suitable
hydrotreating catalysts are described in one or more of U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,156,695, 6,162,350,
6,299,760, 6,582,590, 6,712,955, 6,783,663, 6,863,803, 6,929,738, 7,229,548, 7,288,182,
7,410,924, and 7,544,632, U.S. Patent Application Publication Nos. 2005/0277545, 2006/0060502,
2007/0084754, and 2008/0132407, and International Publication Nos. WO 04/007646, WO
2007/084437, WO 2007/084438, WO 2007/084439, and WO 2007/08447 1, inter alia.
[0037]      In certain embodiments, the hydrotreating catalysts used in the practice of the present
invention are supported catalysts. Any suitable refractory catalyst support material-e.g. metallic
oxide support materials-can be used as supports for the catalyst. Non-limiting examples of
suitable support materials can include: alumina, silica, titania, calcium oxide, strontium oxide,
barium oxide, thermally (at least partially) decomposed organic media, zirconia, magnesia,
diatomaceous earth, lanthanide oxides (including cerium oxide, lanthanum oxide, neodymium
oxide, yttrium oxide, and praseodymium oxide), chromia, thorium oxide, urania, niobia, tantala,
tin oxide, zinc oxide, corresponding phosphates, and the like, and combinations thereof. In certain
embodiments, the supports can include alumina, silica, and silica-alumina. It is to be understood
that the support material can also contain small amounts of contaminants, such as Fe, sulfates, and
various metal oxides, that can be introduced during the preparation of the support material. These
contaminants are typically present in the raw materials used to prepare the support and can
preferably be present in amounts less than about 1 wt %, based on the total weight of the support.
It is preferred that the support material be substantially free of such contaminants. In another
embodiment, about 0 wt % to about 5 wt %, for example from about 0.5 wt % to about 4 wt % or
from about 1 wt % to about 3 wt % of an additive can be present in the support. The additive can

                                                - 17
be selected from the group consisting of phosphorus and metals or metal oxides from Group IA
(alkali metals) of the Periodic Table of the Elements.
[0038]      The catalysts in the hydrotreating step(s) according to the invention may optionally
contain additional components, such as other transition metals (e.g., Group V metals such as
niobium), rare earth metals, organic ligands (e.g., as added or as precursors left over from oxidation
and/or sulfidization steps), phosphorus compounds, boron compounds, fluorine-containing
compounds, silicon-containing      compounds, promoters, binders, fillers, or like agents, or
combinations thereof. The Groups referred to herein reference Groups of the CAS Version as
found in the Periodic Table of the Elements in Hawley's Condensed Chemical Dictionary,             1 3 th
Edition.
[0039]      In some embodiments, the effective hydrotreating conditions can comprise one or more
of: a weight average bed temperature (WABT) from about 550'F (about 288'C) to about 800'F
(about 4270 C); a total pressure from about 300 psig (about 2.1 MPag) to about 3000 psig (about
20.7 MPag), for example from about 700 psig (about 4.8 MPag) to about 2200 psig (about 15.3
MPag), e.g. about 150 bar (about 15.1 MPag); an LHSV from about 0.1 hr-1 to about 20 hr-1, for
example from about 0.2 hr-1 to about 10 hr-1; and a hydrogen treat gas rate from about 500 scf/bbl
(about 85 Nm 3/m 3 ) to about 10000 scf/bbl (about 1700 Nm 3/m 3), for example from about 750
scf/bbl (about 130 Nm 3/m 3) to about 7000 scf/bbl (about 1200 Nm 3/m 3) or from about 1000 scf/bbl
(about 170 Nm 3/m 3) to about 5000 scf/bbl (about 850 Nm 3/m 3 ).
[0040]      Hydrogen-containing (treat) gas, as referred to herein, can be either pure hydrogen or a
gas containing hydrogen, in an amount at least sufficient for the intended reaction purpose(s),
optionally in addition to one or more other gases (e.g., nitrogen, light hydrocarbons such as
methane, and the like, and combinations thereof) that generally do not adversely interfere with or
affect either the reactions or the products.      Impurities, such as H 2S and NH 3 , are typically
undesirable and would typically be removed from, or reduced to desirably low levels in, the treat
gas before it is conducted to the reactor stage(s). The treat gas stream introduced into a reaction
stage can preferably contain at least about 50 vol% hydrogen, for example at least about 75 vol%,
at least about 80 vol%, at least about 85 vol%, or at least about 90 vol%.
[0041]      The feedstock provided to the hydrotreating step according to the invention can, in
some embodiments, comprise both a vacuum resid feed portion and a biofeed (lipid material)
portion. In one embodiment, the lipid material and vacuum resid feed can be mixed together prior
to the hydrotreating step. In another embodiment, the lipid material and vacuum resid feed can be
provided as separate streams into one or more appropriate reactors.

                                                   - 18
[0042]        The term "lipid material" as used according to the invention is a composition comprised
of biological materials. Generally, these biological materials include vegetable fats/oils, animal
fats/oils, fish oils, pyrolysis oils, and algae lipids/oils, as well as components of such materials.
More specifically, the lipid material includes one or more type of lipid compounds.                 Lipid
compounds are typically biological compounds that are insoluble in water, but soluble in nonpolar
(or fat) solvents. Non-limiting examples of such solvents include alcohols, ethers, chloroform,
alkyl acetates, benzene, and combinations thereof.
[0043]        Major classes of lipids include, but are not necessarily limited to, fatty acids, glycerol
derived lipids (including fats, oils and phospholipids), sphingosine-derived lipids (including
ceramides, cerebrosides, gangliosides, and sphingomyelins), steroids and their derivatives,
terpenes and their derivatives, fat-soluble vitamins, certain aromatic compounds, and long-chain
alcohols and waxes.
[0044]        In living organisms, lipids generally serve as the basis for cell membranes and as a form
of fuel storage. Lipids can also be found conjugated with proteins or carbohydrates, such as in the
form of lipoproteins and lipopolysaccharides.
[0045]        Examples of vegetable oils that can be used in accordance with this invention include,
but are not limited to rapeseed (canola) oil, soybean oil, coconut oil, sunflower oil, palm oil, palm
kernel oil, peanut oil, linseed oil, tall oil, corn oil, castor oil, jatropha oil, jojoba oil, olive oil,
flaxseed oil, camelina oil, safflower oil, babassu oil, tallow oil and rice bran oil.
[0046]        Vegetable oils as referred to herein can also include processed vegetable oil material.
Non-limiting examples of processed vegetable oil material include fatty acids fatty acid alkyl
esters. Alkyl esters typically include C I-C5 alkyl esters. One or more of methyl, ethyl, and propyl
esters are preferred.
[0047]        Examples of animal fats that can be used in accordance with the invention include, but
are not limited to, beef fat (tallow), hog fat (lard), turkey fat, fish fat/oil, and chicken fat. The
animal fats can be obtained from any suitable source including restaurants and meat production
facilities.
[0048]        Animal fats as referred to herein also include processed animal fat material.         Non
limiting examples of processed animal fat material include fatty acids and fatty acid alkyl esters.
Alkyl esters typically include CI-C 5 alkyl esters. One or more of methyl, ethyl, and propyl esters
are preferred.
[0049]        Algae oils or lipids are typically contained in algae in the form of membrane
components, storage products, and metabolites. Certain algal strains, particularly microalgae such
as diatoms and cyanobacteria, contain proportionally high levels of lipids. Algal sources for the

                                                   - 19
algae oils can contain varying amounts, e.g., from 2 wt% to 40 wt% of lipids, based on total weight
of the biomass itself.
[0050]      Algal sources for algae oils include, but are not limited to, unicellular and multicellular
algae. Examples of such algae include a rhodophyte, chlorophyte, heterokontophyte, tribophyte,
glaucophyte,     chlorarachniophyte,       euglenoid,    haptophyte,   cryptomonad,     dinoflagellum,
phytoplankton, and the like, and combinations thereof. In one embodiment, algae can be of the
classes Chlorophyceae and/or Haptophyta. Specific species can include, but are not limited to,
Neochloris oleoabundans, Scenedesmus               dimorphus, Euglena gracilis, Phaeodactylum
tricornutum, Pleurochrysiscarterae,Prymnesium parvum, Tetraselmis chui, and Chlamydomonas
reinhardtii.
[0051]      The lipid material portion of the feedstock, when present, can be comprised of
triglycerides, fatty acid alkyl esters, or preferably combinations thereof. In one embodiment where
lipid material is present, the feedstock can include at least about 0.05 wt% lipid material, based on
total weight of the feedstock provided for processing into fuel, preferably at least about 0.5 wt%,
for example at least about 1 wt%, at least about 2 wt%, or at least about 4 wt%. Additionally or
alternately, where lipid material is present, the feedstock can include not more than about 40 wt%
lipid material, based on total weight of the feedstock, preferably not more than about 30 wt%, for
example not more than about 20 wt%, or not more than about 10 wt%.
[0052]      In embodiments where lipid material is present, the feedstock can include not greater
than about 99.9 wt% mineral oil, for example not greater than about 99.8 wt%, not greater than
about 99.7 wt%, not greater than about 99.5 wt%, not greater than about 99 wt%, not greater than
about 98 wt%, not greater than about 97 wt%, not greater than about 95 wt%, not greater than about
90 wt%, not greater than about 85 wt% mineral oil, or not greater than about 80 wt%, based on
total weight of the feedstock. Additionally or alternately, in embodiments where lipid material is
present, the feedstock can include at least about 50 wt% mineral oil, for example at least about 60
wt%, at least about 70 wt%, at least about 75 wt%, or at least about 80 wt% mineral oil, based on
total weight of the feedstock.
[0053]      In some embodiments where lipid material is present, the lipid material can comprise a
fatty acid alkyl ester, such as, but not limited to, fatty acid methyl esters (FAME), fatty acid ethyl
esters (FAEE), and/or fatty acid propyl esters.
Blending the Hydrotreated Vacuum Resid
[0054]      Tools and processes for blending fuel components are well known in the art. See, for
example, US 3,522,169, 4,601,303, 4,677,567. Once the vacuum resid, e.g., made according to
the methods disclosed herein, has been hydrotreated, it can be blended as desired with any of a

                                                  - 20
variety of additives including (e.g.) viscosity modifiers, pour point depressants, lubricity modifiers,
antioxidants, and combinations thereof. The uncracked, hydrotreated vacuum resid can be blended
with a first and a second low sulfur diesel boiling range hydrocarbon stream as necessary to produce
a marine bunker fuel composition having a desired set of marine fuel specifications.

                                        EXAMPLES
[00101]     The following examples are merely illustrative, and do not limit this disclosure in any
way.
Example 1       Hydrotreating and Blending Process

                                                 - 25
[00102]      In prophetic Example 1 (see Figure 1), a high sulfur (e.g., about 0.5 to about 0.8 wt%)
vacuum resid, having been fractionated from a crude oil and exhibiting the properties disclosed in
Table 1 below, is fed at a rate of -106 m 3/hr into a (cat feed) hydrotreating unit that is loaded with
a commercially available alumina-supported Group VIB/Group VIII (e.g., NiMo) hydrotreating
catalyst.
[00103]      In the hydrotreating unit, the vacuum resid is both hydrotreated to remove most (e.g.,
at least about 80 wt%, for example at least about 90 wt% or at least about 95 wt%) of the sulfur
content. The treatment employs a stream of gas that is -80.6% hydrogen. The treatment occurs
under e.g. -101 bar pressure and at e.g. -378'C. The EIT may be between about 315'C and about
455 C, for example between about 360'C and 395 C. The total pressure my range from about 90
bar to about 150 bar, for example about 120 bar.
[00104]      The product from the hydrotreating unit is an uncracked, hydrotreated vacuum resid
product (details in Table 4 below), prior to being fed to an FCC unit.             At the end of the
hydrotreatment process, the resulting uncracked vacuum resid contains between about 0.12 wt%
and about 0.14 wt% sulfur. At least a portion of this uncracked, hydrotreated vacuum resid product
can be diverted from the FCC unit to be blended with a combination of a first diesel additive feed
(Table 2) and a second diesel additive feed (Table 3) to yield a bunker fuel composition with -1000
wppm sulfur and a kinematic viscosity at 50'C of -380 cSt. At least 40% by volume, and up to
100% by volume, of the marine bunker fuel composition can be comprised of the uncracked,
hydrotreated vacuum resid product.
