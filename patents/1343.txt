                          Dosage Regimen for a S1P Receptor Agonist
This application is a divisional of Australian Patent Application No. 2015275246, the
entire content of which is incorporated herein by reference.
The present invention relates to a dosage regimen of a S1P receptor modulator or agonist.
More specifically, the present invention relates to a dosage regimen for the treatment of
patients suffering from autoimmune diseases or disorders, such as, for example, multiple
sclerosis with a S1P receptor modulator or agonist.
S1 P receptor modulators or agonists are compounds which signal as agonists at one or
more sphingosine-1 phosphate receptors, for example, S1 P1 to S1 P8. The binding of an
agonist to a S1 P receptor may, for example, result in the dissociation of intracellular
heterotrimeric G-proteins into Ge-GTP and G88-GTP, and/or the increased phosphorylation
of the agonist-occupied receptor, and/or the activation of downstream signaling
pathways/kinases.
S1 P receptor modulators or agonists are useful therapeutic compounds for the treatment of
various conditions in mammals, especially in human beings. For example, the efficacy of
S1 P receptor modulators or agonists in the prevention of transplant rejection has been
demonstrated in rat (skin, heart, liver, small bowel), dog (kidney), and monkey (kidney)
models. In addition, due to their immune-modulating potency, S1P receptor modulators or
agonists are also useful for the treatment of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. In
particular, the efficacy of the S1 P receptor agonist FTY720 in the treatment of multiple
sclerosis has been demonstrated in humans (as described in, for example, "FTY720 therapy
exerts differential effects on T cell subsets in multiple sclerosis". Mehling M, Brinkmann V,
Antel J, Bar-Or A, Goebels N, Vedrine C, Kristofic C, Kuhle J, Lindberg RL, Kappos L.
Neurology. 2008 Oct 14;71(16):1261-7; and "Oral fingolimod (FTY720) for relapsing multiple
sclerosis". Kappos L, Antel J, Comi G, Montalban X, O'Connor P, Polman CH, Haas T, Korn
AA, Karlsson G, Radue EW; FTY720 D2201 Study Group. N Engl J Med. 2006 Sep
14;355(11):1124-40.).
Multiple sclerosis is the chief cause of neurological disability in young adults and the most
common demyelinating disorder of the central nervous system. Currently available therapies,
such as interferon-8 and glatiramer acetate, only have modest efficacy and therefore
demonstrate only marginal effects on the progression of the disease. Furthermore,
these biological agents are administered parenterally and are associated with some adverse
effects such as, for example, localized reactions at the injection site and pyretic symptoms.
Therefore, there is a strong medical need for an effective oral treatment for multiple
sclerosis.

S1 P receptor modulators or agonists may produce a negative chronotropic effect, i.e. they
may reduce the cardiac rhythm, as described e.g. in "FTY720: Placebo-Controlled Study of
the Effect on Cardiac Rate and Rhythm in Healthy Subjects", Robert Schmouder, Denise
Serra, Yibin Wang, John M. Kovarik, John DiMarco, Thomas L. Hunt and Marie-Claude
Bastien. J. Clin. Pharmacol. 2006; 46; 895. Administration of 1.25 mg of FTY720 may induce
a decrease in heart rate of approximately 8 beats/min (BPM).
As a consequence of this side effect, the S1 P modulator or agonist therapy may have to be
initiated under close medical supervision in order to check that the cardiac rhythm is
maintained at an acceptable level. This may involve the hospitalisation of patients, which
makes the treatment more expensive and complicated.
Therefore, there is a need to reduce the negative chronotropic side effect that may be
generated by the administration of S1 P receptor modulators or agonists, while maintaining
the ability to administer an adequate dosage in order to treat or prevent the diseases for
which the compound is administered. There is furthermore a need to enhance patient
compliance.
Brief Disclosure of the Invention
Surprisingly it has been found that by administering the SIP receptor modulator or agonist
according to a specific dosage regimen, it is possible to reduce side effects which may be
associated with the administration of such compounds. For example, administering a S1P
receptor agonist or modulator according to the specific dosage regimen of the present
invention may significantly, reduce or even completely eliminate, the negative chronotropic
side effect. In particular it may avoid an abrupt drop in the heart rate.
Administering a S1P receptor agonist or modulator according to the specific dosage regimen
of the present invention may also significantly reduce or even completely eliminate the risks
that the patients taken the S1P receptor agonist or modulator suffer from atrio-ventricular
(AV) blocks or heart pause.
Furthermore the specific dosage regimen of the present invention permits to administer a
S1P receptor agonist or modulator to categories of patients for which the ratio risk/benefit
may otherwise be less favourable. Such patients are for example patients susceptible to or
suffering from heart failure or arrythmias, patients with high grade atrio-ventricular blocks or
sick sinus syndrome, patients with a history of syncopal episodes, or patients under beta
blockers or anti-arrhythmic treatment, such as patients under anti-arrhythmic drugs; or

patients that have undergone an interruption or treatment holiday in the maintenance dosage
regime e.g. a holiday of greater than 4 days, greater than 6, 8, 10, 12 or 14 days.
The dosage regimen of the present invention is a regimen for the initiation of SIP receptor
modulator or agonist therapy, which enables the standard daily therapeutic dosage range of
the SiP receptor to be achieved with minimal negative chronotropic effects and/or the AV
block effects possibly associated with S1 P receptor modulator therapy.
S1 P receptor modulators or agonists
Preferred SIP receptor agonists or modulators are, for example, compounds which, in
addition to their S1P binding properties, also have accelerating lymphocyte homing
properties. For example, the compounds may elicit lymphopenia resulting from a re
distribution of lymphocytes from the circulation to the secondary lymphatic tissue, which is
preferably reversible, without evoking a generalized immunosuppression. Suitably, naYve
cells are sequestered and CD4 and CD8 T-cells and B-cells from the blood are stimulated to
migrate into lymph nodes (LN) and Peyer's patches (PP).
SIP receptor modulators or agonists are typically sphingosine analogues, such as 2
substituted 2-amino- propane-1,3-diol or 2-amino-propanol derivatives.

moiety which may be hydrophilic or lipophilic and comprise one or more aliphatic, alicyclic,
aromatic and/or heterocyclic residues. The resultant molecule functions as a
modulator/agonist at one of more sphingosine-1-phosphate receptors.
Suitably, at least one of Z and R1z is or comprises a residue of formula (a).

Dosage Regimen
As previously stated, the present invention provides a novel dosage regimen which is
adapted to minimize the negative chronotropic effects and/or the AV block effects possibly
associated with S1 P receptor modulator or agonist therapy.
Heart effects include AV blocks, which include first degree AV blocks (e.g. PR intervals
greater then 0.2 seconds) and second degree AV blocks e.g. first degree AV blocks. Heart
effects include heart pauses e.g. heart pauses greater than 2 seconds.
According to the invention, there is provided the use of a SiP receptor modulator or agonist
in the manufacture of a medication, whereby said medication is administered in such a way
that during the initial period of treatment the dosage is lower than the standard daily dosage
and the dosage is increased, optionally stepwise, or only once, until the standard daily
dosage dose is reached. Thereafter the treatment is preferably continued with the standard
daily dosage of said SiP receptor modulator or agonist.
Preferably during the initial period of treatment, the medication is administered in a dosage
regimen such that daily decrease in heart rate (e.g. average or minimum daily heart rate) is
acceptable or clinically not significant, or that the sinus rhythm of the patient is normal. For
example, the daily decrease in heart rate (e.g. average or minimum daily heart rate) may be
less than about 4bpm, e.g. less than about 3 bpm or less than about 2bpm.
The term "normal sinus rhythm" refers to the sinus rhythm of the patient when not
undergoing treatment. The evaluation of normal sinus rhythm is within the ability of a
physician. A normal sinus rhythm will generally give rise to a heart rate in the range from 60
 100 bpm.
 Preferably, during the initial period of treatment the dosage is lower than the standard daily
dosage and the dosage is increased, optionally stepwise, or only once, until the standard
daily dosage dose is reached. Thereafter the treatment is preferably continued with the
standard daily dosage of said SIP receptor modulator or agonist.
According to the invention, the "initial period of treatment" refers to the period during which
the SIP receptor modulator or agonist is administered at a dosage lower than the standard

   WO 2010/075239                                                             PCT/US2009/068888
                                                -9
daily dosage. Preferably the "initial period of treatment" starts with the first administration of
the S1P receptor modulator or agonist.
The duration of the initial period of treatment may vary. In an embodiment, the initial period
of treatment is up to 10 days, e.g. about a week. In a further embodiment, the initial period of
treatment is 5 to 14 days, e.g. 4 to 12 days. In a further embodiment, the initial period of
treatment is 7 to 10 days. In yet a further embodiment, the initial period of treatment is 4 to 7
days. In further embodiments, the initial period of treatment is selected from 10 days, or 9
days, or 8 days, or 7 days, or 6 days, or 5 days, or 4 days.
As herein above defined, standard daily dosage (also called standard daily dose) refers to
the required daily maintenance dose of the drug which is given to the patients for treating or
preventing the disease to be treated or prevented. Suitably, the standard daily dosage
corresponds to the therapeutically effective dosage.
The therapeutically effective dosage (also called therapeutic dose) refers to the dosage of
the S1 P receptor modulator or agonist which is necessary to effectively treat the intended
disease or condition (i.e. so that the subject shows reduced signs or symptoms of rebound of
the disease to be treated or prevented, and preferably no signs and symptoms at all).
During the initial period of treatment the S1P receptor modulator or agonist may be
administered at a dosage e.g. up to 10-fold less, e.g. up to 8-fold less, e.g. up to 4-fold less,
than the standard daily maintenance dose, e.g. than the therapeutic dose.
In a preferred embodiment, there is provided the use of an SIP receptor modulator or
agonist in the manufacture of a medication, whereby said medication is administered in such
a way that during the initial period of treatment (e.g. the first 10 days of treatment, e.g. the
first week of treatment, or the first 5 to 14 days of treatment, the first 4 to 12 days of
treatment, or the first 7 to 10 days of treatment, or the first 10, 9, 8, 7, 6 , 5 or 4 days of
treatment), the dosage of said SIP receptor modulator or agonist is given at a dosage of up
to 10-fold less, e.g. up to 5-fold less, than the standard daily dose, e.g. the therapeutic dose.
 Optionally the dose is then raised stepwise up to the standard daily dose, e.g. the
therapeutic dose, during the initial period of treatment as herein above defined.
 Preferred medications comprise medication for patients suffering from chronic long term
diseases, such as autoimmune diseases, e.g. multiple sclerosis, Polymyositis, lupus
 nephritis, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel diseases or psoriasis. In an embodiment

The dosage regimen of the present invention is particularly useful for treating patents at risk
of cardiac side effects, for example patients at risk of heart failure, arrythmias, patients with
high grade atrio-ventricular blocks or sick sinus syndrome, patients with a history of syncopal
episodes, or patients requiring or under beta blockers, or patients requiring or under anti
arrhythmic treatment, such as patients under treatment with Class la (e.g. quinidine,
procainamide) or Class Ill anti-arrhythmic drugs (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol).
For compound A (or B), an example of standard daily dosage may be a daily dosage of up to
5mg, for example, the dosage may be between 0.5 and 5 mg, e.g. between 0.5 and 2mg. In
a specific embodiment, the standard daily dosage is about 1.25 mg. In another embodiment,
the standard daily dosage is about 0.5 mg.
Preferably, the dosage of the SIP receptor modulator or agonist during the initial period of
treatment is increased stepwise in defined increments up to the standard daily dosage of the
SIP receptor modulator or agonist. Preferably, the dosage of said S1P receptor modulator
or agonist during the initial period of treatment as hereinabove defined, e.g. during the initial
10 days, e.g. 1 to 9 days, e.g. first week of treatment is increased in increments of about
1.5- to about 3.5-fold, for example from 2 to 3-fold, for example 2-fold, for example about
1.5-fold.
For example, during the initial period, the dose may be about 10-fold less, or about 8-fold
less, or about 5-fold less, or about 3-fold less, about 2-fold less or about 1.5-fold less than
the standard daily dosage, e.g. than the therapeutic dose. Suitably the initial dosage
administered during the initial period of treatment is about 10-fold less than the standard
daily dosage, e.g. than the therapeutic dose, and is then increased in increments to a daily
dosage which is about 5 fold less than the standard daily dosage and then about 2.5 fold
less than the standard daily dosage. Thereafter, treatment is commenced at the standard
daily dosage.
 In another embodiment of the invention, the initial dosage administered during the initial
period of treatment as hereinabove defined is about 4-fold less than the standard daily
dosage, e.g. than the therapeutic dose, and is then increased in increments to a daily
dosage which is about 2 fold less than the standard daily dosage. Thereafter, treatment is
commenced at the standard daily dosage.
The same dose may be given during the first 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8 days of treatment before
the dosage is increased, preferably during the first 2 to 4 days of treatment. Suitably each
subsequent incremental dosage increase is administered for 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 days. In a

     WO 2010/075239                                                            PCT/US2009/068888

  particular embodiment, each subsequent incremental dosage increase is administered for 2
 or 3 days.
  During the initial period of treatment, i.e. before the standard daily dosage is given, the same
 initial dosage may be given during the first 1 to 7 days, e.g. for 2 to 5 days, e.g. the first 2
 days, before the dosage is further increased, e.g. up to the standard daily dosage in one or
 more increments.
 One or more dosage increases, e.g. up to 10 dosage increases, e.g. up to 8 dosage
 increases, e.g. up to 6 dosage increases, e.g. up to 5 dosage increases, up to 4 dosage
 increases, up to 3 dosage increases, may be performed until the standard daily dosage is
 given. For example 1 to 10, e.g. 1 to 8, e.g. I to 3, e.g. 2 to 8, e.g. 3 to 6 dosage increases
 may be given.
 In an embodiment, the daily dosage is governed by a Fibonacci series i.e. the dosage given
 on a specific day is the sum of the dosages on the previous two days. In an aspect of this
 embodiment, some variation in this scheme is permitted. For example, the dosage on a
 given day may be the sum of the dosages on the two previous days ± 40%, for example ±
 30%, for example ± 20% or ± 10%.
 For example, the first dosage increase may occur on day 2 to day 5, e.g. day 2 to day 4, e.g.
 day 2, day 3, day 4 or day 5, after the first administration. The second dosage increase, if
 any, may occur on day 4 to 10, e.g. day 4 to 6, e.g. day 5, after the first administration. The
 third dosage increase, if any, may occur on day 6 to 10, e.g. day 6 or 7, after first
 administration.
 In one embodiment of the invention, only one or two dosage increase occur before the
 standard daily dosage, e.g. the therapeutic dosage, is given.
 In a particular embodiment, the S1P receptor agonist is Compound A or Compound B, e.g.
 FTY720, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, e.g. the hydrochloride salt of
 FTY720.
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the highest initial dosage of the S1 P
receptor modulator or agonist (e.g. Compound A, Compound B or a salt thereof) is between
0.01 mg and 0.30 mg, e.g. between 0.125 and 0.25mg, preferably 0.125mg or 0.1Mg.
A particularly preferred dosage range of the S1P receptor modulator or agonist (e.g.
Compound A,Compound B or a salt thereof, e.g. the hydrochloride salt of FTY720) during
the initial period of treatment as hereinabove defined is e.g. 0.125-1.25 mg, or 0.1-0.5 mg,
or 0.125-0.5 mg, or 0.25-0.5 mg.

                                                 - 12
 For example it may be a regimen of 0.125mg/0.25mg/0.5mg, respectively, during the initial
 period of e.g. up to the first 10 days. Thereafter the treatment is continued with the standard
 daily dosage, e.g. a dosage of 1.25 mg. This regimen is particularly adapted for compound
 A.
 Alternatively, it may be a regimen comprising an initial daily dose of 0.125mg which is
 subsequently increased to a daily dose of 0.25mg during the initial period of treatment.
 Thereafter the treatment is continued with the standard daily dosage, e.g. 0.5mg. Again, this
 regimen is particularly adapted for compound A.

Example:
A single-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose titration, once-daily, multiple
oral-dose clinical study in healthy subjects was conducted to evaluate the effect of a
dosage regimen of FTY720 according to the present invention.
A total of 36 subjects were randomly assigned to one of the three groups.
Each subject participated in a screening period of maximal 21 days, a baseline
period (Day -1), a 9-day dose-administration period, and clinical study completion
assessments on Day 10. Subjects were assigned to one of the three groups (dose
titration regimen group, placebo control group, or active control group) and received
the once daily dose in a double-blinded manner (Table 1).
In the dose titration group, increasing once daily doses of Compound A (FTY720),
starting at 0.125 mg o.d. and ending at the maximal therapeutic dose of 1.25 mg o.d.
were administered on days 1 to 9 of the study according to the schedule shown in
Table 1 below. The placebo control group received placebo through out the duration
of the study and the active control group received a once daily dose of 1.25 mg of
FTY720 on days 1 to 9.

                                              - 23
Pharmacodynamic and safety assessments are performed up to 24 hours post last
dose. Heart rate is monitored via telemetry on Day -1 through Day 10, 24 hour after
the last dosing. Heart rhythm is assessed via 24hr continuous holter monitoring on
Day -1, Day 1, and Day 9. For each dosing for each subject, the drug is administered
as closely as practically possible to the time administered on Day -1. Safety
assessments includes physical examinations, vital signs and body measurements,
12-lead ECG evaluations, standard clinical laboratory evaluations hematology, blood
chemistry, urinalysis, adverse event and serious adverse event monitoring. Systolic
and diastolic blood pressure and pulse are measured after the subject has rested
quietly in the sifting position for at least 3 minutes. Blood pressure is measured at the
same arm on each occasion. Standard 12-lead ECGs are recorded at Screening,
baseline, 4 hours post-dose on Day 1 and Day 8, and at Study Completion. The
variables recorded are: date and time of ECG, heart rate, PR interval, QT interval
(uncorrected), QTcB, QRS duration. The overall interpretation is collected with a
Yes/No statement to confirm if any clinically relevant abnormalities are present,
which needs to be specified further.
Subjects remain on continuous telemetry, starting before breakfast on Day -1 and
proceeding throughout the administration period up to Day 10 (24 hour after the last
dose). Over this ten day duration of continuous heart rate collection for each subject,
one heart rate value is obtained every minute ('minute unit heart rate'), representing
the average heart rate value over that minute. The heart rate database for each
subject contains approximately 14,400 data points (10 days x 24 hr x 60 min).
24-hour continuous Holter-ECG data are captured via a digital Holter monitor (12
lead, on Days -1, 1, 6, and 8), and transferred for interpretation and reporting. Holter
monitoring starts approximately at 7:00 and the time of dose administration is
regarded as the time "0 hours". Holter "cuts" are derived from the dataset at 1 hour
intervals starting from Day -1 and continuing for 24 hours or the end of the cleaned
Holter monitoring dataset.
Cardiac conduction intervals: arrhythmia monitoring includes the frequency and
duration of sinus pauses (>2 sec and > 3 sec) and atrio-ventricular blocks.
Frequency and duration of atrial and ventricular ectopy and sinus rhythm are also
recorded.
The daily chronotropic effect is defined as the percent decrease in HRmin (minimum heart
rate) between two consecutive days. It is calculated on days 1 to 9.
Results:

                                              - 24
The results are shown in Figure 1. In the placebo group, daily average heart rate
varies by approximately 5 BPM (beats per min) over the course of the study with a
trend for heart rate to increase approximately 3-4 BPM from Day -1 to Day 2. The
FTY720 1.25 mg treatment group manifestes a significant decrease in heart rate of
approximately 8 BPM from Day -1 to Day 1 and an additional decrease in heart rate
approximately 3 BPM from Day 1 to Day 2. The FTY720 titration group manifestes a
gradual decrease in heart rate of approximately 1-2 BPM per day over the course of
eight day course of the dose titration. The initiation of the 1.25 mg FTY720 on Day 8
does not result in dip in heart rate compared to the preceding days.
These results indicate that the use of a dose titration regimen according to the invention
attenuates the negative chronotropic effect seen on Day 1 of FTY720 treatment initiation.
Furthermore multiple analyses have been conducted to compare minimum heart rates
between the two FTY720 treatment group. These analysis show that the FTY720 dose
titration regimen provides improved daily minimum heart rates during the course of the
study.
