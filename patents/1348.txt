SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS OF
MOLECULAR PROFILES ACROSS MULTIPLE TUMOR AND
GERMLINE EXOMES
ABSTRACT
Omics patient data are analysed using sequences or diff objects of tumor and matched normal
tissue to identify patient and disease specific mutations, using transcriptomic data to identify
expression levels of the mutated genes, and pathway analysis based on the so obtained omic data
to identify specific pathway characteristics for the diseased tissue. Most notably, many different
tumors have shared pathway characteristics, and identification of a pathway characteristic of a
tumor may thus indicate effective treatment options ordinarily not considered when tumor
analysis is based on anatomical tumor type only.

[0001] This application claims the benefit of priority to U.S. provisional application having
serial number 62/005766, filed 30-May-14, and which is incorporated by reference herein.
Field of the Invention
[0002] The field of the invention is computational omics, especially as it relates to analysis of
molecular profiles across a large number of tumor and germline exomes from multiple patient
and tumor samples.
Background of the Invention
[0003] The background description includes information that may be useful in understanding
the present invention. It is not an admission that any of the information provided herein is
prior art or relevant to the presently claimed invention, or that any publication specifically or
implicitly referenced is prior art.
[0004] While the clinical world is familiar with genomic assays targeted to a limited number
of mutations as a means to derive molecular insight to therapies, the power to deliver more
comprehensive, non-assumptive, and stochastic molecular analysis is sorely needed to guide
treatment decisions that are unbiased to traditional tissue-by-tissue anatomical assignment of
therapeutics, or a priori assumptions that a few hundred DNA mutations are drivers of
cancer. Indeed, most clinicians today are challenged by a deluge of rapidly advancing
science with which it becomes increasingly difficult to keep pace. In this era of personalized
medicine, there are nearly 800 drugs in development targeted against specific protein targets
driving the growth of the tumor. This cognitive overload may have significant consequences
in decision making in life-threatening diseases as complex as cancer.
[0005] Today the approach most widely used by oncologists to guide treatment selection of
drugs that are targeted against altered proteins is to identify gene DNA mutations in tumor
samples deploying panels of fewer than 500 "actionable" genes. Such actionable genes are
typically identified from large-scale studies of various cancers (see e.g., Nature Genetics 45,
1127-1133 (2013)). All publications and applications herein are incorporated by reference to
the same extent as if each individual publication or patent application were specifically and
                                                 1

individually indicated to be incorporated by reference. Where a definition or use of a term in
an incorporated reference is inconsistent or contrary to the definition of that term provided
herein, the definition of that term provided herein applies and the definition of that term in
the reference does not apply.
[0006] Unfortunately, the current reliance on genotyping of tumor samples to drive treatment
decisions is largely based on the assumption that identification of mutated DNA routinely
translates downstream (from "DNA to protein expression") to an alteration in the underlying
protein pathways that are targeted by the therapy to be selected, and these identified DNA
mutations are thus nominated as clinically actionable. However, exclusive analysis of genetic
mutations in tumor genomes fails to take into account whether or not the mutated genes are
transcribed at all, whether changes in the genome are variants or disease-drivers, and/or what
the functional context of such mutations are, and whether or not compensatory mechanisms
exists in a cell affected by such mutation.
[0007] Therefore, analysis of selected mutations with disregard of the above drawbacks will
likely lead to various false-positive, false negative, and non-relevant results that in turn may
misdirect treatment of a patient. Therefore, there remains a need for improved systems and
methods for comprehensive analysis of molecular profiles.
Summary of The Invention
[0008] The inventive subject matter is drawn to systems and methods of omics analysis in
which shared pathway characteristics are obtained from various distinct tumor samples. Most
preferably, omics analysis includes analysis of tumor and matched normal tissue to identify
patient and tumor specific changes, which is further refined using transcriptomics data. Based
on such analysis, a treatment recommendation is then prepared that is typically independent
of the anatomical tumor type but that takes into account a molecular signature characteristic
of shared pathway characteristics.
[0009] In one aspect of the inventive subject matter, the inventors contemplate a method of
identifying a molecular signature for a tumor cell that includes a step of using an analysis
engine to receive a plurality of data sets from a respective plurality of patients, wherein at
least two (or at least three, or at least five) of the plurality of patients are diagnosed with
different tumors, and wherein each data set is representative of genomics information from
tumor and matched normal cells. In another step, the analysis engine receives transcriptomics
                                                    2

information for the at least two patients, and in yet another step, the analysis engine identifies
shared pathway characteristics among the tumor cells of the at least two patients using the
genomics information and the transcriptomics information. In a still further step, the analysis
engine is then used to assign, on the basis of the shared pathway characteristics, a molecular
signature to the tumor cells, wherein the molecular signature is assigned independently of an
anatomical tumor type, and a patient record is then generated or updated using the molecular
signature.
[0010] While not limiting to the inventive subject matter, it is generally contemplated that the
data sets are in a BAMBAM format, a SAMBAM format, a FASTQ format, or a FASTA
format, and it is typically preferred that the data sets are BAMBAM diff objects. Therefore,
in further contemplated aspects, the data sets will preferably comprise mutation information,
copy number information, insertion information, deletion information, orientation
information and/or breakpoint information.
[0011] With respect to the genomics information it is contemplated that such information
may be whole genome sequencing information or exome sequencing information, and that
the transcriptomics information comprises information on transcription level and/or sequence
information. Most typically, the transcriptomics information will cover at least 50% (or at
least 80%) of all exomes in the genomics information from the tumor cells. Furthermore, it is
contemplated that the transcriptomics information is used in the step of identifying to infer
reduced or absence of function of a protein encoded by a mutated gene.
[0012] Therefore, the inventors contemplate that the shared pathway characteristics will
include a constitutively activated pathway, a functionally impaired pathway, and a
dysregulated pathway, and/or that the shared pathway characteristics may be characterized by
a mutated non-functional protein, mutated dysfunctional protein, an overexpressed protein, or
an under-expressed protein. In still further preferred aspects, the step of identifying is
performed using PARADIGM or other pathway-centric method of analysis.
[0013] Additionally, it is contemplated that the molecular signature comprises information
about one or more pathway elements, and especially drug identification and type of
interaction with the one or more pathway elements. Therefore, it should be appreciated that
the patient record may also include a treatment recommendation based on the molecular
signature of the tumor cells (e.g., treatment recommendation for a first patient with a first
                                                  3

tumor may be based on shared pathway characteristics with a second patient with a distinct
second tumor).
[0014] Various objects, features, aspects and advantages of the inventive subject matter will
become more apparent from the following detailed description of preferred embodiments,

Detailed Description
[0023] The following description includes information that may be useful in understanding
the present invention. It is not an admission that any of the information provided herein is
prior art or relevant to the presently claimed invention, or that any publication specifically or
implicitly referenced is prior art.
                                                 4

[0024] The inventive subject matter provides apparatus, systems, and methods for improved
omics analysis of various tumors. More specifically, the inventors discovered that omics data
analysis can be significantly improved by first identifying patient and tumor relevant changes
in the genome, typically via comparison of tumor and matched normal samples. Once such
differences are ascertained, further transcriptomic data of the same patient are used to identify
whether the changed sequences are expressed in the tumor. The so obtained patient data are
then subjected to pathway analysis to identify pathway characteristics of the tumor, and
particularly shared pathway characteristics of the tumor with various other types of tumors.
As should be readily appreciated, shared pathway characteristics may be employed to inform
treatment using one or more treatment modalities from anatomically unrelated tumors that
would otherwise not have been identified. Viewed from a different perspective, different
tumor types share pathway characteristics irrespective of the anatomical tumor type, and the
knowledge of shared pathway characteristics with respective molecular signatures may
identify drug treatment strategies that had not been appreciated for a particular tumor type.
[0025] Consequently, in one aspect of the inventive subject matter, the inventors contemplate
a method of identifying a molecular signature for a tumor cell, and especially a molecular
signature of a cell signaling pathway. Most typically, identification and analysis is performed
using a fully integrated, cloud-based, supercomputer-driven, genomic, and transcriptomic
analytic engine. It should be noted that any language directed to a computer should be read to
include any suitable combination of computing devices, including servers, interfaces,
systems, databases, agents, peers, engines, controllers, or other types of computing devices
operating individually or collectively. One should appreciate the computing devices
comprise a processor configured to execute software instructions stored on a tangible, non
transitory computer readable storage medium (e.g., hard drive, solid state drive, RAM, flash,
ROM, etc.). The software instructions preferably configure the computing device to provide
the roles, responsibilities, or other functionality as discussed below with respect to the
disclosed apparatus. In especially preferred embodiments, the various servers, systems,
databases, or interfaces exchange data using standardized protocols or algorithms, possibly
based on HTTP, HTTPS, AES, public-private key exchanges, web service APIs, known
financial transaction protocols, or other electronic information exchanging methods. Data
exchanges preferably are conducted over a packet-switched network, the Internet, LAN,
WAN, VPN, or other type of packet switched network.
                                                  5

[0026] In especially preferred methods, an analysis engine receives a plurality of data sets
from a respective plurality of patients, wherein at least two of the plurality of patients are
diagnosed with different tumors, and wherein each data set is representative of genomics
information from tumor and matched normal cells. In a further step, the analysis engine
receives transcriptomics information for the at least two patients and identifies shared
pathway characteristics among the tumor cells of the at least two patients using the genomics
information and the transcriptomics information (of course, it should be noted that shared
pathway characteristics may also be identified only for a single patient sample while pathway
characteristics of other tumors may be obtained from a pathway database). In yet another
step, the analysis engine is then used to assign, on the basis of the shared pathway
characteristics, a molecular signature to the tumor cells, wherein the molecular signature is
assigned independently (i.e., in an agnostic manner) of an anatomical tumor type. In a still
further step, a patient record may be generated or updated using the molecular signature.
[0027] With respect to the data sets from the plurality of patients it is contemplated that the
type of data sets may vary considerably and that numerous types of data sets are deemed
suitable for use herein. Therefore, data sets may include unprocessed or processed data sets,
and exemplary data sets include those having BAMBAM format, SAMBAM format, FASTQ
format, or FASTA format. However, it is especially preferred that the data sets are provided
in BAMBAM format or as BAMBAM diff objects (see e.g., US2012/0059670A1 and
US2012/0066001A1).        Therefore, and viewed from another perspective, it should be noted
that the data sets are reflective of a tumor and a matched normal sample of the same patient to
so obtain patient and tumor specific information. Thus, genetic germ line alterations not
giving rise to the tumor (e.g., silent mutation, SNP, etc.) can be excluded. Of course, it should
be recognized that the tumor sample may be from an initial tumor, from the tumor upon start
of treatment, from a recurrent tumor or metastatic site, etc. In most cases, the matched normal
sample of the patient may be blood, or non-diseased tissue from the same tissue type as the
tumor.
[0028] It should also be noted that the data sets may be streamed from a data set generating
device (e.g., sequencer, qPCR machine, etc.) or provided from a data base storing the data
sets. For example, suitable data sets may be derived from a BAM server (e.g., as described in
US2012/0059670A1 and US2012/0066001A1) and/or a pathway analysis engine (e.g., as
described in W02011/139345A2 and W02013/062505A1). Such is particularly true where
                                                 6

the data sets from a tumor and matched normal sample are not derived from the patient.
Thus, at least some of the data sets may be independently stored and provided, and analysis
may be performed on a newly obtained patient sample (e.g., within one week of obtaining
patient tissue samples) using data sets from the patient's tumor and matched normal sample
and previously stored tumor and matched normal sample not derived from the patient.
[0029] With further respect to the data sets it is noted that the data sets from all tumors are in
a format that allows ready comparison without further conversion and/or processing. Thus,
the data sets will preferably comprise mutation information, methylation status information,
copy number information, insertion/deletion information, orientation information, and/or
breakpoint information specific to the tumor and the patient. It is still further contemplated
that the data set is representative of at least a portion of the entire genome, and most typically
the whole genome. Therefore, the data sets are preferably prepared form whole genome
sequencing covering the entire genome (or at least 50%, or at least 70%, or at least 90% of
the entire genome). Alternatively, exome sequencing is also contemplated, and in most cases
it is contemplated that at least 50%, more typically at least 70, and most typically at least
90% of the entire exome is sequenced.
[0030] Moreover, and with respect to the origin of the data sets it should be appreciated that
numerous non-patient tumor data are used. Therefore, it is contemplated that for data sets
other than a patient data set will be derived from at least two different tumors, and more
preferably from at least three, or at least five different tumor types to identify shared pathway
characteristics. Data sets from different tumor types can be obtained from different patient
samples as such samples are available (e.g., from a hospital, clinical trial, epidemiological
study, etc.) and/or can be provided from previously acquired analyses or data. For example,
the TCGA provides a good sample of well-characterized omic information useful to prepare
data sets suitable for use herein and Table 1 below exemplarily illustrates data used in the
present analysis.

various tumor types are shown with their respective numerical distribution of potentially
actionable genes. As is readily apparent from Figure 1,there was a multitude of actionable
genes, not just single mutation, in almost all tumors. Thus, it should be appreciated that the
analysis and treatment of a tumor requires consideration of more than one changed gene. In
addition, it has previously not yet been appreciated that not all of the mutated genes are
indeed expressed, and with that may or may not lead to actionable or druggable protein
targets as is exemplarily depicted in Figure 2.
[0032] As can be taken from Figure 2, selected mutations in certain tumors were not or only
wealy expressed (i.e., transcribed into RNA, see lower box). Consequently, pharmaceutical
intervention targeting such mutant proteins (e.g., targeting BRAF V600 in glioblastoma) are
not expected to impact the tumor in a significant manner. Conversely, certain other mutated
proteins will provide an attractive target due to their very high rate of expression (e.g., by
                                                            8

targeting BRAF V600 in melanoma). Thus, it should be appreciated that the same mutated
protein may be a suitable target in some cancers or patients and an entirely unsuitable target
in others. Viewed from a different perspective, genomics information without consideration
of transcriptomics data will lack detail needed to guide treatment decisions.
[0033] In particularly preferred aspects, transcription information is obtained to cover at least
50%, or at least 70, or at least 80, or at least 90% of all exomes in the genomics information
from the tumor cells. Thus, it is contemplated that transcripts of a tumor cell or tissue may
also be analyzed for their quantity (and optionally also for sequence information to identify
RNA editing and/or RNA splicing). Such analysis may include threshold values that are
typically user defined as further described in copending US provisional application with the
serial number 62/162530, filed 15-May-15.
[0034] In addition to the lack of consideration of transcriptomics data, the functional impact
of a mutation within a cell signaling network has not been appreciated in most of heretofore
known systems and methods, especially where multiple mutations are present in multiple
genes associated with a tumor. To overcome such shortcoming, the inventors used the patient
and tumor specific mutation information and associated expression levels in an analysis of
cell signaling pathways to thereby obtain information on pathway usage and compensation
where a pathway function was compromised. Therefore, it is noted that the transcriptomics
information is preferably used to infer reduced or absence of function of a protein encoded by
a mutated gene, and with that influence on a particular pathway.
[0035] While various pathway analytical tools are know in the art, the inventors especially
contemplate use of dynamic pathway maps in which pathways are expressed as probabilistic
pathway model. For example, pathway analyses may be performed using PARADIGM, as
described in W02011/139345, W02013/062505, W02014/059036, or W02014/193982,
using the data sets and transcriptomics information to so arrive at the particular pathways
usage of a specific tumor. As will be readily appreciated, where multiple data sets from
multiple patients having distinct tumors as employed, the analysis engine will be able to
identify for each tumor particular pathway characteristics with a molecular signature of the
tumor cells. For example, the analysis engine may identify shared pathway characteristics
among multiple tumor types where such shared characteristics may include a constitutively
activated pathway, a functionally impaired pathway, and a dysregulated pathway. Such
shared pathway may be characterized or due to a variety of factors and exemplary factors
                                                   9

leading to a particular pathway characteristic include a mutated non-functional protein,
mutated dysfunctional protein, an overexpressed protein, or an underexpressed protein in a
pathway, etc. Of course, it should be noted that at least some of the pathway characteristics
may be previously determined and stored in a data base or that at least some of the pathway
characteristics may also be determined de novo. Therefore, it should be recognized that new
patient data may be compared against already obtained data from a database.
[0036] Among other benefits of integrated genomics, transcriptomics, and pathway analysis
for multiple tumor types of multiple patients, it should be appreciated various subsequent
analyses are now possible to group or classify certain molecular events into otherwise not
observable categories. For example, as is illustrated in Figure 3, a principal component
analysis of various expressed mutated oncogenes from different tumors can be performed to
so associate a plurality of specific mutations with a plurality of different tumors. Likewise,
breakpoint analysis over different tumors can be associated with prognostic outcome as
exemplarily shown in Figure 4, or breakpoint frequency and distribution can be associated
with different tumors as exemplarily shown in Figure 5.
[0037] Most notably, and as exemplarily shown in Figure 6, pathway analysis on the basis of
genomics and transcriptomics information may serve to identify certain shared molecular
signatures common to a variety of different tumors. Thus, it should be recognized that a
tumor may be classified as belonging to a class of tumors that are characterized by specific
shared pathway characteristics. With further reference to Figure 6, it is noted that the tumors
of Table 1 together with genomics and transcriptomics information were stratified into six
distinct classes independent of anatomical location. Here, common classes for different
tumors were defined by activation or inhibition of selected signaling pathways (e.g., over
activation of myc transcription and inhibition of NOTCH signaling), which is entirely
independent from a classification based on anatomical tumor type (classified as pancreatic
tumor, breast ductal tumor, etc.).
[0038] Figure 7 exemplarily illustrates a different perspective of the findings of Figure 6
where the tumor classification is expressed as clusters per Figure 6. Here, it is readily
apparent that entirely unrelated tumors (e.g., uterine, rectal, lung adeno.) can be classified
according to specific signaling pathways characteristics having specific molecular signatures.
For example, the molecular signature may comprise information about one or more pathway
elements within a pathway (e.g., Ras, Raf, MEK, Myc). As such, where a tumor shares a
                                                10

common pathway characteristic with one or more common molecular signatures with another
unrelated tumor, the tumor may in fact be treatable using treatment modalities know for the
unrelated tumor. Most typically, the molecular signature information may include a drug
identification (e.g., where Ras is mutated and overexpressed, drug information may include
suitable Ras inhibitors) and/or a type of interaction with the one or more pathway elements
(e.g., where Hedl is mutated and overactive, drug information may include suitable
Heel /Nek inhibitors). Therefore, and viewed from another perspective, a patient tumor may
be characterized as belonging to a specific class where that class is defined as having
unrelated and distinct members (tumors) sharing common pathway characteristics/molecular
signatures within a pathway. Based on the so established classification, treatment options
may be selected based on treatment options known or available for the unrelated and distinct
members. It should be appreciated that the treatment option may target a mutated element of
a particular pathway, but also that the treatment option may target a non-mutated element of
another pathway that compensates for a defect in a pathway in which a mutated element is
disposed.
[0039] In another manner of classification, the inventors contemplate that selected pathways
and/or pathway elements may be analyzed from a multiple different tumors as is exemplarily
shown in Figure 8. Here, selected pathway elements (e.g., tumor suppressors and oncogenes)
are plotted against different tumors, which provides a rapid identification of shared pathway
characteristics and molecular signatures common to multiple tumors. For example, the KRAS
G12 mutant is associated with uterine, rectal, and colon cancers, while mutated APC is
associated with colon adenocarcinoma and rectal cancers.
[0040] Therefore, the inventors contemplate that a patient record will typically include one or
more treatment recommendations based on the molecular signature of the tumor cells (and
with that based on the shared pathway characteristics with other unrelated tumors). In other
words, a treatment recommendation for a first patient with a first tumor may be based on a
shared pathway characteristics with a second patient with a distinct second tumor.
[0041] As used in the description herein and throughout the claims that follow, the meaning
of "a," "an," and "the" includes plural reference unless the context clearly dictates otherwise.
Also, as used in the description herein, the meaning of "in" includes "in" and "on" unless the
context clearly dictates otherwise. Moreover, as used herein, and unless the context dictates
otherwise, the term "coupled to" is intended to include both direct coupling (in which two
                                                11

elements that are coupled to each other contact each other) and indirect coupling (in which at
least one additional element is located between the two elements). Therefore, the terms
"coupled to" and "coupled with" are used synonymously. Moreover, all methods described
herein can be performed in any suitable order unless otherwise indicated herein or otherwise
clearly contradicted by context. The use of any and all examples, or exemplary language
(e.g. "such as") provided with respect to certain embodiments herein is intended merely to
better illuminate the invention and does not pose a limitation on the scope of the invention
otherwise claimed. No language in the specification should be construed as indicating any
non-claimed element essential to the practice of the invention.
[0042] It should be apparent to those skilled in the art that many more modifications besides
those already described are possible without departing from the inventive concepts herein.
The inventive subject matter, therefore, is not to be restricted except in the scope of the
appended claims. Moreover, in interpreting both the specification and the claims, all terms
should be interpreted in the broadest possible manner consistent with the context. In
particular, the terms "comprises" and "comprising" should be interpreted as referring to
elements, components, or steps in a non-exclusive manner, indicating that the referenced
elements, components, or steps may be present, or utilized, or combined with other elements,
components, or steps that are not expressly referenced. Where the specification claims refers
to at least one of something selected from the group consisting of A, B, C .... and N, the text
should be interpreted as requiring only one element from the group, not A plus N, or B plus
N, etc.

CLAIMS
1.   A method of diagnosing treatability of a tumor cell with a drug by identifying a
     molecular signature for the tumor cell, comprising:
     receiving, by an analysis engine, a plurality of data sets from a respective plurality of
             patients, wherein at least two of the plurality of patients are diagnosed with
             different tumors;
     wherein each data set is representative of genomics information from tumor and matched
             normal cells;
     receiving, by the analysis engine, transcriptomics information for the at least two
             patients;
     identifying, by the analysis engine, shared pathway characteristics among the tumor cells
             of the at least two patients using the genomics information and the
             transcriptomics information;
     using the analysis engine to assign, on the basis of the shared pathway characteristics, a
             molecular signature to the tumor cells, wherein the molecular signature is
             assigned independently of an anatomical tumor type; and
     using the molecular signature of the tumor cell to identify treatability of the tumor cell
             with the drug.
