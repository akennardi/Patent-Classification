POWERED SURGICAL STAPLING DEVICE
CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS
[0001] The content of Australian Patent Application No. 2014200501 is incorporated herein by
reference in its entirety.
FIELD
[0002] The present disclosure relates to a surgical stapler for implanting mechanical surgical
fasteners into the tissue of a patient, and, in particular, to a surgical stapler which is powered by
a motor for firing surgical fasteners into tissue and a controller for determining one or more
conditions related to the firing of the surgical fasteners and controlling the stapler in response to
one or more sensed feedback signals.
BACKGROUND
[0003] Current known devices can typically require 10-60 pounds of manual hand force to
clamp tissue and deploy and form surgical fasteners in tissue which, over repeated use, can
cause a surgeon's hand to become fatigued. Gas powered pneumatic staplers which implant
surgical fasteners into tissue are known in the art. Certain of these instruments utilize a
pressurized gas supply which connects to a trigger mechanism. The trigger mechanism, when
depressed, simply releases pressurized gas to implant a fastener into tissue.
[0004] Motor-powered surgical staplers are also known in the art. These include powered
surgical staplers having motors which activate staple firing mechanisms. In some instances, the
stapler firing mechanism may improperly deploy surgical fasteners that may have negative
effects on the patient. Thus, there is a need for new and improved powered surgical staplers that
include various sensors. The sensors detect improperly deployed surgical fasteners and provide
relevant feedback to a controller or user regarding the same.
OBJECT
[0005] It is the object of the present invention to substantially overcome or ameliorate one or
more of the disadvantages of the prior art, or at least provide a useful alternative.

SUMMARY
[0006] According to the present invention there is provided a method for detecting a successful
deployment of a surgical fastener, the method comprising:
         activating a motor to move a firing rod of a surgical stapler thereby firing a surgical
fastener;
         measuring a first current draw waveform of the motor; and
         comparing the first current draw waveform to a second current draw waveform obtained
from test firing data stored in a memory of the surgical stapler to determine whether the surgical
fastener is successfully deployed
[0007] According to one aspect of the present disclosure, a powered surgical stapler is
disclosed. The stapler includes a housing, an endoscopic portion extending distally from the
housing and defining a first longitudinal axis, a drive motor disposed at least partially within a
housing and a firing rod disposed in mechanical cooperation with the drive motor. The firing
rod is translated longitudinally and is rotatable by the motor about the first longitudinal axis
extending therethrough. The stapler also includes an end effector disposed adjacent a distal
portion of the endoscopic portion. The end effector is in mechanical cooperation with the firing
rod to fire a surgical fastener. The stapler further includes a current sensor configured to
measure a current draw on the motor and a controller configured to determine whether the
surgical fastener is successfully deployed based on the current draw on the motor.
[0008] According to another aspect of the present disclosure, a method for detecting a
successful deployment of a surgical fastener is provided. The method includes providing a
powered surgical stapler. The stapler includes a housing, an endoscopic portion extending
distally from the housing and defining a first longitudinal axis, a drive motor disposed at least
partially within a housing and a firing rod disposed in mechanical cooperation with the drive
motor. The firing rod is translated longitudinally and is rotatable by the motor about the first
longitudinal axis extending therethrough. The stapler also includes an end effector disposed
adjacent a distal portion of the endoscopic portion. The end effector is in mechanical
cooperation with the firing rod to fire a surgical fastener. The stapler further includes a current
sensor configured to measure a current draw on the motor and a controller configured to
determine whether the surgical fastener is successfully deployed based on the current draw on
the motor. The stapler fires the surgical fastener and detects the current draw on the motor. The

                                                  3
detected current draw is compared to successful test firing data and the result of the comparison
between the detected current draw and the successful test firing data is outputted.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0047] Embodiments of the presently disclosed powered surgical instrument are now described
in detail with reference to the drawings, in which like reference numerals designate identical or
corresponding elements in each of the several views. As used herein the term "distal" refers to
that portion of the powered surgical instrument, or component thereof, farther from the user
while the term "proximal" refers to that portion of the powered surgical instrument or
component thereof, closer to the user.
[0048] A powered surgical instrument, e.g., a surgical stapler, in accordance with the present
disclosure is referred to in the figures as reference numeral 10. Referring initially to Fig. 1,
powered surgical instrument 10 includes a housing 110, an endoscopic portion 140 defining a
first longitudinal axis A-A extending therethrough, and an end effector 160, defining a second
longitudinal axis B-B extending therethrough. Endoscopic portion 140 extends distally from
housing 110 and the end effector 160 is disposed adjacent a distal portion of endoscopic portion
140. In an embodiment, the components of the housing 110 are sealed against infiltration of

                                                   7
particulate and/or fluid contamination and help prevent damage of the component by the
sterilization process.
 [0049] According to an embodiment of the present disclosure, end effector 160 includes a first
jaw member having one or more surgical fasteners (e.g., cartridge assembly 164) and a second
opposing jaw member including an anvil portion for deploying and forming the surgical
fasteners (e.g., an anvil assembly 162). In certain embodiments, the staples are housed in
cartridge assembly 164 to apply linear rows of staples to body tissue either in simultaneous or
sequential manner. Either one or both of the anvil assembly 162 and the cartridge assembly 164
are movable in relation to one another between an open position in which the anvil assembly
 162 is spaced from cartridge assembly 164 and an approximated or clamped position in which
the anvil assembly 162 is in juxtaposed alignment with cartridge assembly 164.
 [0050] It is further envisioned that end effector 160 is attached to a mounting portion 166,
which is pivotably attached to a body portion 168. Body portion 168 may be integral with
endoscopic portion 140 of powered surgical instrument 10, or may be removably attached to the
instrument 10 to provide a replaceable, disposable loading unit (DLU) or single use loading unit
(SULU) (e.g., loading unit 169). In certain embodiments, the reusable portion may be
configured for sterilization and re-use in a subsequent surgical procedure.
 [0051] The loading unit 169 may be connectable to endoscopic portion 140 through a bayonet
connection. It is envisioned that the loading unit 169 has an articulation link connected to
mounting portion 166 of the loading unit 169 and the articulation link is connected to a linkage
rod so that the end effector 160 is articulated as the linkage rod is translated in the distal
proximal direction along first longitudinal axis A-A. Other means of connecting end effector
 160 to endoscopic portion 140 to allow articulation may be used, such as a flexible tube or a
tube comprising a plurality of pivotable members.
 [0052] The loading unit 169 may incorporate or be configured to incorporate various end
effectors, such as vessel sealing devices, linear stapling devices, circular stapling devices,
cutters, etc. Such end effectors may be coupled to endoscopic portion 140 of powered surgical
instrument 10. The loading unit 169 may include a linear stapling end effector that does not
articulate. An intermediate flexible shaft may be included between handle portion 112 and

                                                   8
loading unit. It is envisioned that the incorporation of a flexible shaft may facilitate access to
and/or within certain areas of the body.
[0053] With reference to Fig. 2, an enlarged view of the housing 110 is illustrated according to
an embodiment of the present disclosure. In the illustrated embodiment, housing 110 includes a
handle portion 112 having a main drive switch 114 disposed thereon. The switch 114 may
include first and second switches 114a and 114b formed together as a toggle switch. The handle
portion 112, which defines a handle axis H-H, is configured to be grasped by fingers of a user.
The handle portion 112 has an ergonomic shape providing ample palm grip leverage which
helps prevent the handle portion 112 from being squeezed out of the user's hand during
operation. Each switch 1 14a and 114b is shown as being disposed at a suitable location on
handle portion 112 to facilitate its depression by a user's finger or fingers.
[0054] Additionally, and with reference to Figs. 1 and 2, switches 1 14a, 1 14b may be used for
starting and/or stopping movement of drive motor 200 (Fig. 4). In one embodiment, the switch
1 14a is configured to activate the drive motor 200 in a first direction to advance firing rod 220
(Fig. 5) in a distal direction thereby clamping the anvil and the cartridge assemblies 162 and
164. Conversely, the switch 114b may be configured to retract the firing rod 220 to open the
anvil and cartridge assemblies 162 and 164 by activating the drive motor 200 in a reverse
direction. The retraction mode initiates a mechanical lock out, preventing further progression of
stapling and cutting by the loading unit 169. The toggle has a first position for activating switch
1 14a, a second position for activating switch 1 14b, and a neutral position between the first and
second positions. The details of operation of the drive components of the instrument 10 are
discussed in more detail below.
[0055] The housing 110, in particular the handle portion 112, includes switch shields 1 17a and
1 17b. The switch shields 1 17a and 1 17b may have a rib-like shape surrounding the bottom
portion of the switch 114a and the top portion of the switch 114b, respectively. The switch
shield 1 17a and 117b prevent accidental activation of the switch 114. Further, the switches 1 14a
and 1 14b have high tactile feedback requiring increased pressure for activation.
[0056] In one embodiment, the switches 114a and 114b are configured as multi-speed (e.g., two
or more), incremental or variable speed switches which control the speed of the drive motor 200
and the firing rod 220 in a non-linear manner. For example, switches 1 14a, b can be pressure-

                                                   9
sensitive. This type of control interface allows for gradual increase in the rate of speed of the
drive components from a slower and more precise mode to a faster operation. To prevent
accidental activation of retraction, the switch 1 14b may be disconnected electronically until a
fail safe switch is pressed. In addition a third switch 1 14c may also be used for this purpose.
Additionally or alternatively, the fail safe can be overcome by pressing and holding the switch
1 14b for a predetermined period of time from about 100 ms to about 2 seconds. The firing rod
220 then automatically retracts to its initial position unless the switch 1 14b is activated (e.g.,
pressed and released) during the retraction mode to stop the retraction. Subsequent pressing of
the switch 114b after the release thereof resumes the retraction. Alternatively, the retraction of
the firing rod 220 can continue to full retraction even if the switch 1 14b is released, in other
embodiments.
[0057] The switches 1 14a and 1 14b are coupled to a non-linear speed control circuit 115 which
can be implemented as a voltage regulation circuit, a variable resistance circuit, or a
microelectronic pulse width modulation circuit. The switches 114a and 144b may interface with
the control circuit 115 by displacing or actuating variable control devices, such as rheostatic
devices, multiple position switch circuit, linear and/or rotary variable displacement transducers,
linear and/or rotary potentiometers, optical encoders, ferromagnetic sensors, and Hall Effect
sensors. This allows the switches 1 14a and 1 14b to operate the drive motor 200 in multiple
speed modes, such as gradually increasing the speed of the drive motor 200 either incrementally
or gradually depending on the type of the control circuit 115 being used, based on the depression
of the switches 114a and 114b.
[0058] In a particular embodiment, the switch 1 14c may also be included (Figs. 1, 2 and 4),
wherein depression thereof may mechanically and/or electrically change the mode of operation
from clamping to firing. The switch 1 14c is recessed within the housing 110 and has high
tactile feedback to prevent false actuations. Providing of a separate control switch to initialize
the firing mode allows for the jaws of the end effector to be repeatedly opened and closed, so
that the instrument 10 is used as a grasper until the switch 1 14c is pressed, thus activating the
stapling and/or cutting. The switch 114 may include one or more microelectronic membrane
switches, for example. Such a microelectronic membrane switch includes a relatively low
actuation force, small package size, ergonomic size and shape, low profile, the ability to include
molded letters on the switch, symbols, depictions and/or indications, and a low material cost.
Additionally, switches 114 (such as microelectronic membrane switches) may be sealed to help

                                                   10
facilitate sterilization of the instrument 10, as well as helping to prevent particle and/or fluid
contamination.
[0059] As an alternative to, or in addition to switches 114, other input devices may include
voice input technology, which may include hardware and/or software incorporated in a control
system 501 (Fig. 20), or a separate digital module connected thereto. The voice input technology
may include voice recognition, voice activation, voice rectification and/or embedded speech.
The user may be able to control the operation of the instrument in whole or in part through voice
commands, thus freeing one or both of the user's hands for operating other instruments. Voice
or other audible output may also be used to provide the user with feedback.
[0060] Referring to Fig. 3, a proximal area 118 of housing 110 having a user interface 120 is
shown. The user interface 120 includes a screen 122 and a plurality of switches 124. The user
interface 120 may display various types of operational parameters of the instrument 10 such as
"mode" (e.g., rotation, articulation or actuation), which may be communicated to user interface
via a sensor, "status" (e.g., angle of articulation, speed of rotation, or type of actuation) and
"feedback," such as whether staples have been fired based on the information reported by the
sensors disposed in the instrument 10.
[0061] The screen 122 may be an LCD screen, a plasma screen, electroluminescent screen and
the like. In one embodiment the screen 122 may be a touch screen, obviating the need for the
switches 124. The touch screen may incorporate resistive, surface wave, capacitive, infrared,
strain gauge, optical, dispersive signal or acoustic pulse recognition touch screen technologies.
The touch screen may be used to allow the user to provide input while viewing operational
feedback. This approach may enable facilitation of sealing screen components to help sterilize
the instrument 10, as well as preventing particle and/or fluid contamination. In certain
embodiments, screen is pivotably or rotatably mounted to the instrument 10 for flexibility in
viewing screen during use or preparation (e.g., via a hinge or ball-and-socket mount).
[0062] The switches 124 may be used for starting and/or stopping movement of the instrument
10 as well as selecting the pivot direction, speed and/or torque. It is also envisioned that at least
one switch 124 can be used for selecting an emergency mode that overrides various settings.
The switches 124 may also be used for selecting various options on the screen 122, such as

                                                  11
responding to prompts while navigating user interface menus and selecting various settings,
allowing a user input different tissue types, and various sizes and lengths of staple cartridges.
[0063] The switches 124 may be formed from a micro-electronic tactile or non-tactile
membrane, a polyester membrane, elastomer, plastic or metal keys of various shapes and sizes.
Additionally, switches may be positioned at different heights from one another and/or may
include raised indicia or other textural features (e.g., concavity or convexity) to allow a user to
depress an appropriate switch without the need to look at user interface 120.
[0064] In addition to the screen 122, the user interface 120 may include one or more visual
outputs 123 which may include one or more colored visible lights or light emitting diodes
("LED") to relay feedback to the user. The visual outputs 123 may include corresponding
indicators of various shapes, sizes and colors having numbers and/or text which identify the
visual outputs 123. The visual outputs 123 are disposed on top of the housing 110 such that the
outputs 123 are raised and protrude in relation to the housing 110 providing for better visibility
thereof.
[0065] The multiple lights display in a certain combination to illustrate a specific operational
mode to the user. In one embodiment, the visual outputs 123 include a first light (e.g., yellow)
123a, a second light (e.g., green) 123b and a third light (e.g., red) 123c. The lights are operated
in a particular combination associated with a particular operational mode as listed in Table 1
below.

[0066] In another embodiment, the visual output 123 may include a single multi-colored LED
which display a particular color associated with the operational modes as discussed above with
respect to the first, second and third lights in Table 1.

                                                 14
[0067] The user interface 120 also includes audio outputs 125 (e.g., tones, bells, buzzers,
integrated speaker, etc.) to communicate various status changes to the user such as lower
battery, empty cartridge, etc. The audible feedback can be used in conjunction with or in lieu of
the visual outputs 123. The audible feedback may be provided in the forms of clicks, snaps,
beeps, rings and buzzers in single or multiple pulse sequences. In one embodiment, a simulated
mechanical sound may be prerecorded which replicates the click and/or snap sounds generated
by mechanical lockouts and mechanisms of conventional non-powered instruments. This
eliminates the need to generate such mechanical sounds through the actual components of the
instrument 10 and also avoids the use of beeps and other electronic sounds which are usually
associated with other operating room equipment, thereby preventing confusion from extraneous
audible feedback.
[0068] The instrument 10 may also provide for haptic or vibratory feedback through a haptic
mechanism (not explicitly shown) within the housing 110. The haptic feedback may be used in
conjunction with the auditory and visual feedback or in lieu thereof to avoid confusion with the
operating room equipment which relies on audio and visual feedback. The haptic mechanism
may be an asynchronous motor that vibrates in a pulsating manner. In one embodiment, the
vibrations are at a frequency of about 30 Hz or above providing a displacement having an
amplitude of 1.5 mm or lower to limit the vibratory effects from reaching the loading unit 169.
[0069] It is also envisioned that user interface 120 includes different colors and/or intensities of
text on screen and/or on switches for further differentiation between the displayed items. The
visual, auditory or haptic feedback can be increased or decreased in intensity. For example, the
intensity of the feedback may be used to indicate that the forces on the instrument are becoming
excessive.
[0070] Figs. 2-4 illustrate an articulation mechanism 170, including an articulation housing 172,
a powered articulation switch 174, an articulation motor 132 and a manual articulation knob
176. Translation of the powered articulation switch 174 or pivoting of the manual articulation
knob 176 activates the articulation motor 132 which then actuates an articulation gear 233 of the
articulation mechanism 170 as shown in Fig. C. Actuation of articulation mechanism 170
causes the end effector 160 to move from its first position, where longitudinal axis B-B is
substantially aligned with longitudinal axis A-A, towards a position in which longitudinal axis
B-B is disposed at an angle to longitudinal axis A-A. Preferably, a plurality of articulated

                                                 15
positions is achieved. The powered articulation switch 174 may also incorporate similar non
linear speed controls as the clamping mechanism as controlled by the switches 114a and 114b.
[0071] Further, the housing 110 includes switch shields 169 having a wing-like shape and
extending from the top surface of the housing 110 over the switch 174. The switch shields 169
prevent accidental activation of the switch 174 and require the user to reach below the shield
169 in order to activate the articulation mechanism 170.
[0072] Additionally, articulation housing 172 and powered articulation switch 174 are mounted
to a rotating housing assembly 180. Rotation of a rotation knob 182 about first longitudinal axis
A-A causes housing assembly 180 as well as articulation housing 172 and powered articulation
switch 174 to rotate about first longitudinal axis A-A, and thus causes corresponding rotation of
distal portion 224 of firing rod 220 and end effector 160 about first longitudinal axis A-A. The
articulation mechanism 170 is electro-mechanically coupled to first and second conductive rings
157 and 159 which are disposed on the housing nose assembly 155 as shown in Figs. 4 and 26.
The conductive rings 157 and 159 may be soldered and/or crimped onto the nose assembly 155
and are in electrical contact with the power source 400 thereby providing electrical power to the
articulation mechanism 170. The nose assembly 155 may be modular and may be attached to
the housing 110 during assembly to allow for easier soldering and/or crimping of the rings. The
articulation mechanism 170 includes one or more brush and/or spring loaded contacts in contact
with the conductive rings 157 and 159 such that as the housing assembly 180 is rotated along
with the articulation housing 172 the articulation mechanism 170 is in continuous contact with
the conductive rings 157 and 159 thereby receiving electrical power from the power source 400.
[0073] Further details of articulation housing 172, powered articulation switch 174, manual
articulation knob 176 and providing articulation to end effector 160 are described in detail in
commonly-owned U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 11/724,733 filed March 15, 2007, the
contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety. It is envisioned that any
combinations of limit switches, proximity sensors (e.g., optical and/or ferromagnetic), linear
variable displacement transducers and shaft encoders which may be disposed within housing
110, may be utilized to control and/or record an articulation angle of end effector 160 and/or
position of the firing rod 220.

                                                   16
[0074] Figs. 4-8 illustrate various internal components of the instrument 10, including a drive
motor 200, a drive tube 210 and a firing rod 220 having a proximal portion 222 and a distal
portion 224. The drive tube 210 is rotatable about drive tube axis C-C extending therethrough.
Drive motor 200 is disposed in mechanical cooperation with drive tube 210 and is configured to
rotate the drive tube 210 about drive gear axis C-C. In one embodiment, the drive motor 200
may be an electrical motor or a gear motor, which may include gearing incorporated within its
housing.
[0075] The housing 110 may be formed from two halves 110a and 1 10b as illustrated in Fig. 3.
The two housing portion halves 11 Oa and 11 Ob may be attached to each other using screws at
boss locators 111 which align the housing portions 1 Oa and 11 Ob. In addition, the housing 110
may be formed from plastic and may include rubber support members applied to the internal
surface of the housing 110 via a two-shot molding process. The rubber support members may
isolate the vibration of the drive components (e.g., drive motor 200) form the rest of the
instrument 10.
[0076] The housing halves 1 Oa and 1 Ob may be attached to each via a thin section of plastic
(e.g., a living hinge) that interconnects the halves 1 Oa and 1 Ob allowing the housing 110 to be
opened by breaking away the halves 1 Oa and 11 Ob.
[0077] In one embodiment, the drive components (e.g., including a drive motor 200, a drive
tube 210 and a firing rod 220, etc.) may be mounted on a support plate allowing the drive
components to be removed from the housing 110 after the instrument 10 has been used. The
support plate mounting in conjunction with the hinged housing halves 11 Oa and 11 Ob provide
for reusability and recyclability of specific internal components while limiting contamination
thereof.
[0078] With reference to Figs. 4-6, a firing rod coupling 190 is illustrated. Firing rod coupling
190 provides a link between the proximal portion 222 and the distal portion 224 of the firing rod
220. Specifically, the firing rod coupling 190 enables rotation of the distal portion 224 of the
firing rod 220 with respect to proximal portion 222 of firing rod 220. Thus, firing rod coupling
190 enables proximal portion 222 of firing rod 220 to remain non-rotatable, as discussed below
with reference to an alignment plate 350, while allowing rotation of distal portion 224 of firing
rod 220 (e.g., upon rotation of rotation knob 182).

                                                   17
 [0079] With reference to Figs. 5 and 6, the proximal portion 222 of firing rod 220 includes a
threaded portion 226, which extends through an internally-threaded portion 212 of drive tube
210. This relationship between firing rod 220 and drive tube 210 causes firing rod 220 to move
distally and/or proximally, in the directions of arrows D and E, along threaded portion 212 of
drive tube 210 upon rotation of drive tube 210 in response to the rotation of the drive motor 200.
As the drive tube 210 rotates in a first direction (e.g., clockwise), firing rod 220 moves
proximally as illustrated in Fig. 5, the firing rod 220 is disposed at its proximal-most position.
As the drive tube 210 rotates in a second direction (e.g., counter-clockwise), firing rod 220
moves distally as illustrated in Fig. 6, the firing rod 220 is disposed at its distal-most position.
 [0080] The firing rod 220 is distally and proximally translatable within particular limits.
 Specifically, a first end 222a of proximal portion 222 of firing rod 220 acts as a mechanical stop
in combination with an alignment plate 350. That is, upon retraction when firing rod 220 is
translated proximally, first end 222a contacts a distal surface 351 of alignment plate 350, thus
preventing continued proximal translation of firing rod 220 as shown in Fig. 5. Additionally,
threaded portion 226 of the proximal portion 222 acts as a mechanical stop in combination with
alignment plate 350. That is, when firing rod 220 is translated distally, the threaded portion 226
contacts a proximal surface 353 of the alignment plate 350, thus preventing further distal
translation of firing rod 220 as shown Fig. 6. The alignment plate 350 includes an aperture
therethrough, which has a non-round cross-section. The non-round cross-section of the aperture
prevents rotation of proximal portion 222 of firing rod 220, thus limiting proximal portion 222
of firing rod 220 to axial translation therethrough. Further, a proximal bearing 354 and a distal
bearing 356 are disposed at least partially around drive tube 210 for facilitation of rotation of
drive tube 210, while helping align drive tube 210 within housing 110.
 [0081] Rotation of drive tube 210 in a first direction (e.g., counter-clockwise) corresponds with
distal translation of the firing rod 220 which actuates jaw members 162, 164 of the end effector
 160 to grasp or clamp tissue held therebetween. Additional distal translation of firing rod 220
ejects surgical fasteners from the end effector 160 to fasten tissue by actuating cam bars and/or
an actuation sled 74 (Fig. 9). Further, the firing rod 220 may also be configured to actuate a
knife (not explicitly shown) to sever tissue. Proximal translation of firing rod 220
corresponding with rotation of the drive tube 210 in a second direction (e.g., clockwise) actuates
jaw members 162, 164 and/or knife to retract or return to corresponding pre-fired positions.
Further details of firing and otherwise actuating end effector 160 are described in detail in

                                                 18
commonly-owned U.S. Patent No. 6,953,139 to Milliman et al. (the '139 Milliman patent), the
disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference herein.
[0082] Fig. 8 shows an exploded view of the loading unit 169. The end effector 160 may be
actuated by an axial drive assembly 213 having a drive beam or drive member 266. The distal
end of the drive beam 213 may include a knife blade. In addition, the drive beam 213 includes a
retention flange 40 having a pair of cam members 40a which engage the anvil and the cartridge
assembly 162 and 164 during advancement of the drive beam 213 longitudinally. The drive
beam 213 advances an actuation sled 74 longitudinally through the staple cartridge 164. The
sled 74 has cam wedges for engaging pushers 68 disposed in slots of the cartridge assembly 164,
as the sled 74 is advanced. Staples 66 disposed in the slots are driven through tissue and against
the anvil assembly 162 by the pushers 66.
[0083] With reference to Fig. 8, a drive motor shaft 202 is shown extending from a planetary
gear 204 that is attached to drive motor 200. Drive motor shaft 202 is in mechanical
cooperation with clutch 300. Drive motor shaft 202 is rotated by the drive motor 200, thus
resulting in rotation of clutch 300. Clutch 300 includes a clutch plate 302 and a spring 304 and
is shown having wedged portions 306 disposed on clutch plate 302, which are configured to
mate with an interface (e.g., wedges 214) disposed on a proximal face 216 of drive tube 210.
[0084] Spring 304 is illustrated between planetary gear 204 and drive tube 210. Specifically,
and in accordance with the embodiment illustrated in Fig. 8, spring 304 is illustrated between
clutch face 302 and a clutch washer 308. Additionally, drive motor 200 and planetary gear 204
are mounted on a motor mount 310. As illustrated in Fig. 8, motor mount 310 is adjustable
proximally and distally with respect to housing 110 via slots 312 disposed in motor mount 310
and protrusions 314 disposed on housing 110.
[0085] In an embodiment of the disclosure, the clutch 300 is implemented as a slip
unidirectional clutch to limit torque and high inertia loads on the drive components. Wedged
portions 306 of clutch 300 are configured and arranged to slip with respect to wedges 214 of
proximal face 216 of drive tube 210 unless a threshold force is applied to clutch plate 302 via
clutch spring 304. Further, when spring 304 applies the threshold force needed for wedged
portions 306 and wedges 214 to engage without slipping, drive tube 210 will rotate upon
rotation of drive motor 200. It is envisioned that wedged portions 306 and/or wedges 214 are

                                                   19
configured to slip in one and/or both directions (i.e., clockwise and/or counter-clockwise) with
respect to one another until a threshold force is attained.
[0086] As illustrated in Figs. 10 and 11, the clutch 300 is shown with a unidirectional clutch
plate 700. The clutch plate 700 includes a plurality of wedged portions 702 having a slip face
704 and a grip face 706. The slip face 704 has a curved edge which engages the wedges 214 of
the drive tube 210 up to a predetermined load. The grip face 706 has a flat edge which fully
engages the drive tube 210 and prevents slippage. When the clutch plate 700 is rotated in a first
direction (e.g., clockwise) the grip face 706 of the wedged portions 702 engage the wedges 214
without slipping, providing for full torque from the drive motor 200. When the clutch plate 700
is rotated in a reverse direction (e.g., counterclockwise) the slip face 704 of the wedged portions
702 engage the wedges 214 and limit the torque being transferred to the drive tube 210. Thus, if
the load being applied to the slip face 704 is over the limit, the clutch 300 slips and the drive
tube 210 is not rotated. This prevents high load damage to the end effector 160 or tissue which
can occur due to the momentum and dynamic friction of the drive components. More
specifically, the drive mechanism of the instrument 10 can drive the drive rod 220 in a forward
direction with less torque than in reverse. Use of a unidirectional clutch eliminates this problem.
In addition electronic clutch may also be used to increase the motor potential during retraction
(e.g., driving the drive rod 220 in reverse) as discussed in more detail below.
[0087] It is further envisioned that drive motor shaft 202 includes a D-shaped cross-section 708,
which includes a substantially flat portion 710 and a rounded portion 712. Thus, while drive
motor shaft 202 is translatable with respect to clutch plate 302, drive motor shaft 202 will not
"slip" with respect to clutch plate 302 upon rotation of drive motor shaft 202. That is, rotation of
drive motor shaft 202 will result in a slip-less rotation of clutch plate 302.
[0088] The loading unit, in certain embodiments according to the present disclosure, includes an
axial drive assembly that cooperates with firing rod 220 to approximate anvil assembly 162 and
cartridge assembly 164 of end effector 160, and fire staples from the staple cartridge. The axial
drive assembly may include a beam that travels distally through the staple cartridge and may be
retracted after the staples have been fired, as discussed above and as disclosed in certain
embodiments of the '139 Milliman patent.

                                                 20
[0089] With reference to Fig. 4, the instrument 10 includes a power source 400 which may be a
rechargeable battery (e.g., lead-based, nickel-based, lithium-ion based, etc.). It is also envisioned
that the power source 400 includes at least one disposable battery. The disposable battery may
be between about 9 volts and about 30 volts.
[0090] The power source 400 includes one or more battery cells 401 depending on the current
load needs of the instrument 10. Further, the power source 400 includes one or more
ultracapacitors 402 which act as supplemental power storage due to their much higher energy
density than conventional capacitors. Ultracapacitors 402 can be used in conjunction with the
cells 401 during high energy draw. The ultracapacitors 402 can be used for a burst of power
when energy is desired/required more quickly than can be provided solely by the cells 401(e.g.,
when clamping thick tissue, rapid firing, clamping, etc.), as cells 401 are typically slow-drain
devices from which current cannot be quickly drawn. This configuration can reduce the current
load on the cells thereby reducing the number of cells 401. It is envisioned that cells 401 can be
connected to the ultracapacitors 402 to charge the capacitors.
[0091] The power source 400 may be removable along with the drive motor 200 to provide for
recycling of theses components and reuse of the instrument 10. In another embodiment, the
power source 400 may be an external battery pack which is worn on a belt and/or harness by the
user and wired to the instrument 10 during use.
[0092] The power source 400 is enclosed within an insulating shield 404 which may be formed
from an absorbent, flame resistant and retardantmaterial. The shield 404 prevents heat
generated by the power source 400 from heating other components of the instrument 10. In
addition, the shield 404 may also be configured to absorb any chemicals or fluids which may
leak from the cells 402 during heavy use and/or damage.
[0093] The power source 400 is coupled to a power adapter 406 which is configured to connect
to an external power source (e.g., DC transformer). The external power source may be used to
recharge the power source 400 or provide for additional power requirements. The power adapter
406 may also be configured to interface with electrosurgical generators which can then supply
power to the instrument 10. In this configuration, the instrument 10 also includes an AC-to-DC
power source which converts RF energy from the electrosurgical generators and powers the
instrument 10.

                                                  21
[0094] In another embodiment the power source 400 is recharged using an inductive charging
interface. The power source 400 is coupled to an inductive coil (not explicitly shown) disposed
within the proximal portion of the housing 110. Upon being placed within an electromagnetic
field, the inductive coil converts the energy into electrical current that is then used to charge the
power source 400. The electromagnetic field may be produced by a base station (not explicitly
shown) which is configured to interface with the proximal portion of the housing 110, such that
the inductive coil is enveloped by the electromagnetic field. This configuration eliminates the
need for external contacts and allows for the proximal portion of the housing 110 to seal the
power source 400 and the inductive coil within a water-proof environment which prevents
exposure to fluids and contamination.
[0095] With reference to Fig. 5, the instrument 10 also includes one or more safety circuits such
as a discharge circuit 410 and a motor and battery operating module 412. For clarity, wires and
other circuit elements interconnecting various electronic components of the instrument 10 are
not shown, but such electromechanical connections wires are contemplated by the present
disclosure. Certain components of the instrument 10 communicate wirelessly.
[0096] The discharge circuit 410 is coupled to a switch 414 and a resistive load 417 which are in
turn coupled to the power source 400. The switch 414 may be a user activated or an automatic
(e.g., timer, counter) switch which is activated when the power source 400 needs to be fully
discharged for a safe and low temperature disposal (e.g., at the end of surgical procedure). Once
the switch 414 is activated, the load 417 is electrically connected to the power source 400 such
that the potential of the power source 400 is directed to the load 417. The automatic switch may
be a timer or a counter which is automatically activated after a predetermined operational time
period or number of uses to discharge the power source 400. The load 417 has a predetermined
resistance sufficient to fully and safely discharge all of the cells 401.
[0097] The motor and battery operating module 412 is coupled to one or more thermal sensors
413 which determine the temperature within the drive motor 200 and the power source 400 to
ensure safe operation of the instrument 10. The sensors may be an ammeter for determining the
current draw within the power source 400, a thermistor, a thermopile, a thermocouple, a thermal
infrared sensor and the like. Monitoring temperature of these components allows for a
determination of the load being placed thereon. The increase in the current flowing through
these components causes an increase in temperature therein. The temperature and/or current

                                                 22
draw data may then be used to control the power consumption in an efficient manner or assure
safe levels of operation.
[0098] In order to ensure safe and reliable operation of the instrument 10, it is desirable to
ensure that the power source 400 is authentic and/or valid (e.g., conforms to strict quality and
safety standards) and operating within a predetermined temperature range. Authentication that
the power source 400 is valid minimizes risk of injury to the patient and/or the user due to poor
quality.
[0099] With reference to Fig. 9, the power source 400 is shown having one or more battery cells
401, a temperature sensor 403 and an embedded microcontroller 405 coupled thereto. The
microcontroller 405 is coupled through wired and/or wireless communication protocols to
microcontroller 500 (Fig. 14) of the instrument 10 to authenticate the power source 400. In one
embodiment, the temperature sensor 403 can be coupled directly to the microcontroller 500
instead of being coupled to the embedded microcontroller 405. The temperature sensor 403 may
be a thermistor, a thermopile, a thermocouple, a thermal infrared sensor, a resistance
temperature detector, linear active thermistor, temperature-responsive color changing strips,
bimetallic contact switches, and the like. The temperature sensor 403 reports the measured
temperature to the microcontroller 405 and/or microcontroller 500.
[0100] The embedded microcontroller 405 executes a so-called challenge-response
authentication algorithm with the microcontroller 500 which is illustrated in Fig. 10. In step
630, the power source 400 is connected to the instrument 10 and the instrument 10 is switched
on. The microcontroller 500 sends a challenge request to the embedded microcontroller 405.
In step 632, the microcontroller 405 interprets the challenge request and generates a response as
a reply to the request. The response may include an identifier, such as a unique serial number
stored in a radio frequency identification tag or in memory of the microcontroller 405, a unique
electrical measurable value of the power source 400 (e.g., resistance, capacitance, inductance,
etc.). In addition, the response includes the temperature measured by the temperature sensor
403.
[0101] In step 634, the microcontroller 500 decodes the response to obtain the identifier and the
measured temperature. In step 636, the microcontroller 500 determines if the power source 400
is authentic based on the identifier, by comparing the identifier against a pre-approved list of

                                                    23
authentic identifiers. If the identifier is not valid, the instrument 10 is not going to operate and
displays a "failure to authenticate battery" message via the user interface 120. If the identifier is
valid, the process proceeds to step 640 where the measured temperature is analyzed to determine
if the measurement is within a predetermined operating range. If the temperature is outside the
limit, the instrument 10 also displays the failure message. Thus, if the temperature is within the
predetermined limit and the identifier is valid, in step 642, the instrument commences operation,
which may include providing a "battery authenticated" message to the user.
[0102] Referring back to Figs. 4 and 5 a plurality of sensors for providing feedback information
relating to the function of the instrument 10 are illustrated. Any combination of sensors may be
disposed within the instrument 10 to determine its operating stage, such as, staple cartridge load
detection as well as status thereof, articulation, clamping, rotation, stapling, cutting and
retracting, and the like. The sensors can be actuated by proximity, displacement or contact of
various internal components of the instrument 10 (e.g., firing rod 220, drive motor 200, etc.).
[0103] In the illustrated embodiments, the sensors can be rheostats (e.g., variable resistance
devices), current monitors, conductive sensors, capacitive sensors, inductive sensors, thermal
based sensors, limit actuated switches, multiple position switch circuits, pressure transducers,
linear and/or rotary variable displacement transducers, linear and/or rotary potentiometers,
optical encoders, ferromagnetic sensors, Hall Effect sensors, and proximity switches. The
sensors measure rotation, velocity, acceleration, deceleration, linear and/or angular
displacement, detection of mechanical limits (e.g., stops), etc. This is attained by implementing
multiple indicators arranged in either linear or rotational arrays on the mechanical drive
components of the instrument 10. The sensors then transmit the measurements to the
microcontroller 500 which determines the operating status of the instrument 10. In addition, the
microcontroller 500 also adjusts the motor speed or torque of the instrument 10 based on the
measured feedback.
[0104] In embodiments where the clutch 300 is implemented as a slip clutch as shown in Figs.
10 and 11, linear displacement sensors (e.g., linear displacement sensor 237) are positioned
distally of the clutch 300 to provide accurate measurements. In this configuration, slippage of
the clutch 300 does not affect the position, velocity and acceleration measurements recorded by

[01051 With reference to Fig. 4, a load switch 230 is disposed within the articulation housing
172. The switch 230 is connected in series with the switch 114, preventing activation of the
instrument 10 unless the loading unit 169 is properly loaded into the instrument 10. If the
loading unit 169 is not loaded into the instrument 10, the main power switch (e.g., switch 114) is
open, thereby preventing use of any electronic or electric components of the instrument 10. This
also prevents any possible current draw from the power source 400 allowing the power source
400 to maintain a maximum potential over its specified shelf life.
[0106] Thus, the switch 230 acts as a so-called "lock-out" switch which prevents false
activation of the instrument 10 since the switch is inaccessible to external manipulation and can
only be activated by the insertion of the loading unit 169. The switch 230 is activated by
displacement of a plunger or sensor tube as the loading unit 169 is inserted into the endoscopic
portion 140. Once the switch 230 is activated, the power from the power source 400 is supplied
to the electronic components (e.g., sensors, microcontroller 500, etc.) of the instrument 10
providing the user with access to the user interface 120 and other inputs/outputs. This also
activates the visual outputs 123 to light up according to the light combination indicative of a
properly loaded loading unit 169 wherein all the lights are off as described in Table 1.
[0107] More specifically, as shown in Figs. 18 and 19, the endoscopic portion 140 includes a
sensor plate 360 therein which is in mechanical contact with a sensor tube also disposed within
the endoscopic portion 140 and around the distal portion 224 of firing rod 220. The distal
portion 224 of the firing rod 220 passes through an opening 368 at a distal end of a sensor cap
364. The sensor cap 364 includes a spring and abuts the switch 230. This allows the sensor cap
364 to be biased against the sensor tube 362 which rests on the distal end of the sensor cap 364
without passing through the opening 368. Biasing of the sensor tube 362 then pushes out the
sensor plate 360 accordingly.
[0108] When the loading unit 169 is loaded into the endoscopic portion 140, the proximal
portion 171 abuts the sensor plate 360 and displaces the plate 360 in a proximal direction. The
sensor plate 360 then pushes the sensor tube 362 in the proximal direction which then applies
pressure on the sensor cap 364 thereby compressing the spring 366 and activating the switch 230
denoting that the loading unit 169 has been properly inserted.

                                                    25
[0109] Once the loading unit 169 is inserted into the endoscopic portion, the switch 230 also
determines whether the loading unit 169 is loaded correctly based on the position thereof. If the
loading unit 169 is improperly loaded, the switch 114 is not activated and an error code is
relayed to the user via the user interface 120 (e.g., all the lights are off as described in Table 1).
If the loading unit 169 has already been fired, any mechanical lockouts have been previously
activated or the staple cartridge has been used, the instrument 10 relays the error via the user
interface 120, e.g., the first light 123a is flashing.
[0110] In one embodiment, a second lock-out switch 259 (Fig. 4) coupled to the main switch
114 may be implemented in the instrument 10 as a bioimpedance, capacitance or pressure sensor
disposed on the top surface of the handle portion 112 configured to be activated when the user
grasps the instrument 10. Thus, unless the instrument 10 is grasped properly, the operation of
the switch 114 is disabled.
[0111] With reference to Fig. 5, the instrument 10 includes a position calculator 416 for
determining and outputting current linear position of the firing rod 220. The position calculator
416 is electrically connected to a linear displacement sensor 237 and a rotation speed detecting
apparatus 418 is coupled to the drive motor 200. The apparatus 418 includes an encoder 420
coupled to the motor for producing two or more encoder pulse signals in response to the rotation
of the drive motor 200. The encoder 420 transmits the pulse signals to the apparatus 418 which
then determines the rotational speed of the drive motor 200. The position calculator 416
thereafter determines the linear speed and position of the firing rod based on the rotational speed
of the drive motor 200 since the rotation speed is directly proportional to the linear speed of the
firing rod 220. The position calculator 416 and the speed calculator 422 are coupled to the
microcontroller 500 which controls the drive motor 200 in response to the sensed feedback from
the calculators 416 and 422. This configuration is discussed in more detail below with respect to
Fig. 20.
[0112] The instrument 10 includes first and second indicators 320a, 320b disposed on the firing
rod 220, which determine the speed of firing rod 220 and the location of firing rod 220 with
respect to drive tube 210 and/or housing 110. For instance, a limit switch may be activated (e.g.,
shaft start position sensor 231 and clamp position sensor 232) by sensing first and second
indicators 320a and/or 320b (e.g., bumps, grooves, indentations, etc.) passing thereby to
determine position of firing rod 220, speed of firing rod 220 and mode of the instrument 10

                                                     26
(e.g., clamping, grasping, firing, sealing, cutting, retracting). Further, the feedback received
from first and second indicators 320a, 320b may be used to determine when firing rod 220
should stop its axial movement (e.g., when drive motor 200 should cease) depending on the size
of the particular loading unit attached thereto.
[0113] More specifically, as the firing rod 220 is moved in the distal direction from its resting
(e.g., initial) position, the first actuation of the position sensor 231 is activated by the first
indicator 320a which denotes that operation of the instrument 10 has commenced. As the
operation continues, the firing rod 220 is moved further distally to initiate clamping, which
moves first indicator 320a to interface with clamp position sensor 232. Further advancement of
the firing rod 220 moves the second indicator 320b to interface with the position sensor 232
which indicates that the instrument 10 has been fired.
[0114] As discussed above, the position calculator 416 is coupled to a linear displacement
sensor 237 disposed adjacent to the firing rod 220. In one embodiment, the linear displacement
sensor 237 may be a magnetic sensor. The firing rod 220 may be magnetized or may include
magnetic material therein. The magnetic sensor may be a ferromagnetic sensor or a Hall Effect
sensor which is configured to detect changes in a magnetic field. As the firing rod 220 is
translated linearly due to the rotation of the drive motor 200, the change in the magnetic field in
response to the translation motion is registered by the magnetic sensor. The magnetic sensor
transmits data relating to the changes in the magnetic field to the position calculator 416 which
then determines the position of the firing rod 220 as a function of the magnetic field data.
[0115] In one embodiment, a select portion of the firing rod 220 may be magnetized, such as the
threads of the internally-threaded portion 212 or other notches (e.g., indicators 320a and/or
320b) disposed on the firing rod 220 may include or be made from a magnetic material. This
allows for correlation of the cyclical variations in the magnetic field with each discrete
translation of the threads as the magnetized portions of the firing rod 220 are linearly translated.
The position calculator 416 thereafter determines the distance and the position of the firing rod
220 by summing the number of cyclical changes in the magnetic field and multiplies the sum by
a predetermined distance between the threads and/or notches.
[0116] In one embodiment, the linear displacement sensor 237 may be a potentiometer or a
rheostat. The firing rod 220 includes a contact (e.g., wiper terminal) disposed in

                                                 27
electromechanical contact with the linear displacement sensor 237. The contact slides along the
surface of the linear displacement sensor 237 as the firing rod 220 is moved in the distal
direction by the drive motor 200. As the contact slides across the potentiometer and/or the
rheostat, the voltage of the potentiometer and the resistance of the rheostat vary accordingly.
Thus, the variation in voltage and resistance is transmitted to the position calculator 416 which
then extrapolates the distance traveled by the firing rod 220 and/or the firing rod coupling 190
and the position thereof.
[0117] In one embodiment, the position calculator 416 is coupled to one or more switches 421
which are actuated by the threads of the internally-threaded portion 212 or the indicators 320a
and/or 320b as the firing rod 220 and the firing rod coupling 190 are moved in the distal
direction. The position calculator 416 counts the number of threads which activated the switch
421 and then multiplies the number by a predetermined distance between the threads or the
indicators 320a and/or 320b.
[0118] The instrument 10 also includes a speed calculator 422 which determines the current
speed of a linearly moving firing rod 220 and/or the torque being provided by the drive motor
200. The speed calculator 422 is connected to the linear displacement sensor 237 which allows
the speed calculator 422 to determine the speed of the firing rod 220 based on the rate of change
of the displacement thereof.
[0119] The speed calculator 422 is coupled to the rotation speed detecting apparatus 424 which
includes the encoder 426. The encoder 426 transmits the pulses correlating to the rotation of the
drive motor 200 which the speed calculator 422 then uses to calculate the linear speed of the
firing rod 220. In another embodiment, the speed calculator 422 is coupled to a rotational
sensor 239 which detects the rotation of the drive tube 210, thus, measuring the rate of rotation
of the drive tube 210 which allows for determination of the linear velocity of the firing rod 220.
[0120] The speed calculator 422 is also coupled to a voltage sensor 428 which measures the
back electromotive force ("EMF") induced in the drive motor 200. The back EMF voltage of the
drive motor 200 is directly proportional to the rotational speed of the drive motor 200 which, as
discussed above, is used to determine the linear speed of the firing rod 220.

                                                     28
[0121] Monitoring of the speed of the drive motor 200 can also be accomplished by measuring
the voltage across the terminals thereof under constant current conditions. An increase in a load
of the drive motor 200 yields a decrease in the voltage applied at the motor terminals, which is
directly related to the decrease in the speed of the motor. Thus, measuring the voltage across the
drive motor 200 provides for determining the load being placed thereon. In addition, by
monitoring the change of the voltage over time (dV/dt), the microprocessor 500 can detect a
quick drop in voltage which correlates to a large change in the load or an increase in temperature
of the drive motor 200 and/or the power source 400.
[0122] In a further embodiment, the speed calculator 422 is coupled to a current sensor 430
(e.g., an ammeter). The current sensor 430 is in electrical communication with a shunt resistor
432 which is coupled to the drive motor 200. The current sensor 430 measures the current being
drawn by the drive motor 200 by measuring the voltage drop across the resistor 432. Since the
current used to power the drive motor 200 is proportional to the rotational speed of the drive
motor 200 and, hence, the linear speed of the firing rod 220, the speed calculator 422 determines
the speed of the firing rod 220 based on the current draw of the drive motor 200.
[0123] The speed calculator 422 may also be coupled to a second voltage sensor (not explicitly
shown) for determining the voltage within the power source 400 thereby calculating the power
draw directly from the source. In addition, the change in current over time (dI/dt) can be
monitored to detect quick spikes in the measurements which correspond to a large increase in
applied torque by the drive motor 200. Thus, the current sensor 430 is used to determine the
speed and the load of the drive motor 200.
[0124] In addition, the velocity of the firing rod 220 as measured by the speed calculator 422
may be then compared to the current draw of the drive motor 200 to determine whether the drive
motor 200 is operating properly. Namely, if the current draw is not commensurate (e.g., large)
with the velocity (e.g., low) of the firing rod 220 then the motor 200 is malfunctioning (e.g.,
locked, stalled, etc.). If a stall situation is detected, or the current draw exceeds predetermined
limits, the position calculator 416 then determines whether the firing rod 220 is at a mechanical
stop. If this is the case, then the microcontroller 500 can shut down the drive motor 200 or
enters a pulse and/or pause mode (e.g., discontinuous supply of power to the drive motor 200) to
unlock the instrument 10 and retract the firing rod 220.

                                                   29
[0125] In one embodiment, the speed calculator 422 compares the rotation speed of the drive
tube 210 as detected by the rotation sensor 239 and that of the drive motor 200 based on the
measurements from and the rotation speed detecting apparatus 424. This comparison allows the
speed calculator 422 to determine whether there is clutch activation problem (e.g., slippage) if
there is a discrepancy between the rotation of the clutch 300 and that of the drive tube 210. If
slippage is detected, the position calculator 416 then determines whether the firing rod 220 is at
a mechanical stop. If this is the case, then the microcontroller 500 can shut down the instrument
10 or enter a pulse and/or pause mode (e.g., discontinuous supply of power to the drive motor
200), or retract the firing rod 220.
[0126] In addition to linear and/or rotational displacement of the firing rod 220 and other drive
components, the instrument 10 also includes sensors adapted to detect articulation of the end
effector 160. With reference to Fig. 4, the instrument 10 includes a rotation sensor 241 adapted
to indicate the start position, the rotational direction and the angular displacement of the rotating
housing assembly 180 at the start of the procedure as detected by the shaft start position sensor
231. The rotation sensor 241 operates by counting the number of indicators disposed on the
inner surface of the rotation knob 182 by which the rotation knob 182 has been rotated. The
count is then transmitted to the microcontroller 500 which then determines the rotational
position of the endoscopic portion 142. This can be communicated wirelessly or through an
electrical connection on the endoscopic portion and wires to the microcontroller 500.
[0127] The instrument 10 also includes an articulation sensor 235 which determines articulation
of the end effector 160. The articulation sensor 235 counts the number of 263 disposed on the
articulation gear 233 by which the articulation knob 176 has been rotated from its 0' position,
namely the center position of the articulation knob 176 and, hence, of the end effector 160 as
shown in Fig. 5. The 0' position and can be designated by a central unique indicator 265 also
disposed on the articulation gear 233 which corresponds with the first position of the end
effector 160, where longitudinal axis B-B is substantially aligned with longitudinal axis A-A.
The count is then transmitted to the microcontroller 500 which then determines the articulation
position of the end effector 160 and reports the articulation angle via the interface 120.
[0128] In addition, the articulation angle can be used for the so-called "auto stop" mode.
During this operational mode, the instrument 10 automatically stops the articulation of the end
effector 160 when the end effector 160 is at its central first position. Namely, as the end effector

                                                   30
160 is articulated from a position in which longitudinal axis B-B is disposed at an angle to
longitudinal axis A-A towards the first position, the articulation is stopped when the longitudinal
axis B-B is substantially aligned with longitudinal axis A-A. This position is detected by the
articulation sensor 235 based on the central indicator. This mode allows the endoscopic portion
140 to be extracted without the user having to manually align the end effector 160.
[0129] With reference to Fig. 1, the present disclosure provides a loading unit identification
system 440 which allows the instrument 10 to identify the loading unit 169 and to determine
operational status thereof. The identification system 440 provides information to the instrument
10 on staple size, cartridge length, type of the loading unit 169, status of cartridge, proper
engagement, and the like. This information allows the instrument to adjust clamping forces,
speed of clamping and firing and end of stroke for various length staple cartridges.
[0130] The loading unit identification system 440 may also be adapted to determine and
communicate to the instrument 10 (e.g., a control system 501 shown in Fig. 20) various
information, including the speed, power, torque, clamping, travel length and strength limitations
for operating the particular end effector 160. The control system 501 may also determine the
operational mode and adjust the voltage, clutch spring loading and stop points for travel of the
components. More specifically, the identification system may include a component (e.g., a
microchip, emitter or transmitter) disposed in the end effector 160 that communicates (e.g.,
wirelessly, via infrared signals, etc.) with the control system 501, or a receiver therein. It is also
envisioned that a signal may be sent via firing rod 220, such that firing rod 220 functions as a
conduit for communications between the control system 501 and end effector 160. In another
embodiment, the signals can be sent through an intermediate interface, such as a feedback
controller 603 (Figs. 15-17).
[0131] By way of example, the sensors discussed above may be used to determine if the staples
have been fired from the staple cartridge, whether they have been fully fired, whether and the
extent to which the beam has been retracted proximally through the staple cartridge and other
information regarding the operation of the loading unit. In certain embodiments of the present
disclosure, the loading unit incorporates components for identifying the type of loading unit,
and/or staple cartridge loaded on the instrument 10, including infra red, cellular, or radio
frequency identification chips. The type of loading unit and/or staple cartridge may be received

                                                  31
by an associated receiver within the control system 501, or an external device in the operating
room for providing feedback, control and/or inventory analysis.
[0132] Information can be transmitted to the instrument 10 via a variety of communication
protocols (e.g., wired or wireless) between the loading unit 169 and the instrument 10. The
information can be stored within the loading unit 169 in a microcontroller, microprocessor, non
volatile memory, radio frequency identification tags, and identifiers of various types such as
optical, color, displacement, magnetic, electrical, binary and gray coding (e.g., conductance,
resistance, capacitance, impedance).
[0133] In one embodiment, the loading unit 169 and the instrument 10 include corresponding
wireless transceivers, an identifier 442 and an interrogator 444 respectively. The identifier 442
includes memory or may be coupled to a microcontroller for storing various identification and
status information regarding the loading unit 169. Once the loading unit 169 is coupled to the
instrument 10, the instrument 10 interrogates the identifier 442 via the interrogator 444 for an
identifying code. In response to the interrogatory, the identifier 442 replies with the identifying
code corresponding to the loading unit 169. During operation, once identification has occurred,
the identifier 442 is configured to provide the instrument 10 with updates as to the status of the
loading unit 169 (e.g., mechanical and/or electrical malfunction, position, articulation, etc.).
[0134] The identifier 442 and the interrogator 444 are configured to communicate with each
other using one or more of the following communication protocols such as Bluetooth@,
ANT3@, KNX@, ZWave@, X10@ Wireless USB@, IrDA@, Nanonet@, Tiny OS, ZigBee@,
802.11 IEEE, and other radio, infrared, UHF, VHF communications and the like. In one
embodiment, the transceiver 400 may be a radio frequency identification (RFID) tag either
active or passive, depending on the interrogator capabilities of the transceiver 402.
[0135] Figs. 11 A and B illustrate additional embodiments of the loading unit 169 having various
types of identification devices. With reference to Fig. 11 A, a proximal end 171 of the loading
unit 169 having an electrical identifier 173 is shown. The identifier 173 may include one or
more resistors, capacitors, inductors and is coupled with a corresponding electrical contact 181
disposed on the distal end of the endoscopic portion 140. The contact may include slip rings,
brushes and/or fixed contacts disposed in the endoscopic portion. The identifier 173 may be

                                                   32
disposed on any location of the loading unit 168 and may be formed on a flexible or fixed circuit
or may be traced directly on the surface of the loading unit 169.
[0136] When the loading unit 169 is coupled with the endoscopic portion 140, the contact
applies a small current through the electrical identifier 173. The interrogator contact also
includes a corresponding electrical sensor which measures the resistance, impedance,
capacitance, and/or impedance of the identifier 173. The identifier 173 has a unique electrical
property (e.g., resistance, capacitance, inductance, etc.) which corresponds to the identifying
code of the loading unit 169, thus, when the electrical property thereof is determined, the
instrument 10 determines the identity of the loading unit 169 based on the measured property.
[0137] In one embodiment, the identifier 173 may be a magnetic identifier such as gray coded
magnets and/or ferrous nodes incorporating predetermined unique magnetic patterns identifying
the loading unit 169 by the identifying code. The magnetic identifier is read via a magnetic
sensor (e.g., ferromagnetic sensor, Hall Effect sensor, etc.) disposed at the distal end of the
endoscopic portion 140. The magnetic sensor transmits the magnetic data to the instrument 10
which then determines the identity of the loading unit 169.
[0138] Fig. 11 B illustrates the proximal end 171 of the loading unit 169 having one or more
protrusions 175. The protrusions 175 can be of any shape, such as divots, bumps, strips, etc., of
various dimensions. The protrusions 175 interface with corresponding displacement sensors
183 disposed within the proximal segment of the endoscopic portion 140. The sensors are
displaced when the protrusions 175 are inserted into the endoscopic portion. The amount of the
displacement is analyzed by the sensors and converted into identification data, allowing the
instrument 10 to determine staple size, cartridge length, type of the loading unit 169, proper
engagement, and the like. The displacement sensors can be switches, contacts, magnetic
sensors, optical sensors, variable resistors, linear and rotary variable displacement transducers
which can be spring loaded. The switches are configured to transmit binary code to the
instrument 10 based on their activation status. More specifically, some protrusions 175 extend a
distance sufficient to selectively activate some of the switches, thereby generating a unique code
based on the combination of the protrusions 175.
[0139] In another embodiment, the protrusion 175 can be color coded. The displacement
sensors 183 include a color sensor configured to determine the color of the protrusion 175 to

                                                  33
measure one or more properties of the loading unit 169 based on the color and transmits the
information to the instrument 10.
[0140] Fig. 12 shows a method for identifying the loading unit 169 and providing status
information concerning the loading unit 169 to the instrument 10. In step 650 it is determined
whether the loading unit 169 is properly loaded into the instrument 10. This may be determined
by detecting whether contact has been made with the identifier 173 and/or protrusions 175. If
the loading unit 169 is properly loaded, in step 652, the loading unit 169 communicates to the
instrument 10 a ready status (e.g., turning on the first light of the visual outputs 123).
[0141] In 654, the instrument 10 verifies whether the loading unit 169 has been previously fired.
The identifier 442 stores a value indicative of the previously fired status. If the loading unit 169
was fired, in step 656, the instrument 10 provides an error response (e.g., flashing the first light
of the visual outputs 123). If the loading unit 169 has not been fired, in step 658 the loading unit
169 provides identification and status information (e.g., first light is turned on) to the instrument
10 via the identification system 440. The determination whether the loading unit 169 has been
fired is made based on the saved "previously fired" signal saved in the memory of the identifier
442 as discussed in more detail below with respect to step 664. In step 660, the instrument 10
adjusts its operating parameters in response to the information received from the loading unit
169.
[0142] The user performs a surgical procedure via the instrument 10 in step 662. Once the
procedure is complete and the loading unit 169 has been fired, the instrument 10 transmits a
"previously fired" signal to the loading unit 169. In step 664, the loading unit 169 saves the
"previously fired" signal in the memory of the identifier 442 for future interrogations by the
instrument 10 as discussed with respect to step 654.
[0143] With reference to Fig. 13, the loading unit 169 includes one or more tissue sensors
disposed within the end effector 160 for detecting the type of object being grasped, such
recognizing non-tissue objects and the tissue type of the object. The sensors are also configured
to determine amount of blood flow being passed between the jaw members of the end effector
160. More specifically, a first tissue sensor 177 is disposed at a distal portion of the anvil
assembly 162 and a second tissue sensor 179 is disposed at a distal portion of the cartridge

                                                  34
assembly 164. The sensors 177 and 179 are coupled to the identifier 442 allowing for
transmission of sensor data to the microcontroller 500 of the instrument 10.
[0144] The sensors 177 and 179 are adapted to generate a field and/or waves in one or more
arrays or frequencies therebetween. The sensors 177 and 179 may be acoustic, ultrasonic,
ferromagnetic, Hall Effect sensors, laser, infrared, radio frequency, or piezoelectric devices.
The sensors 177 and 179 are calibrated for ignoring commonly occurring material, such as air,
bodily fluids and various types of human tissue and for detecting certain types of foreign matter.
The foreign matter may be bone, tendons, cartilage, nerves, major arteries and non-tissue matter,
such as ceramic, metal, plastic, etc.
[0145] The sensors 177 and 179 detect the foreign passing between the anvil and cartridge
assemblies 162 and 164 based on the absorption, reflection and/or filtering of the field signals
generated by the sensors. If the material reduces or reflects a signal, such that the material is
outside the calibration range and is, therefore, foreign, the sensors 177 and 179 transmit the
interference information to the microcontroller 500 which then determines the type of the
material being grasped by the end effector 160. The determination may be made by comparing
the interference signals with a look up table listing various types of materials and their
associated interference ranges. The microcontroller 500 then alerts the user of the foreign
material being grasped as well as the identity thereof. This allows the user to prevent clamping,
cutting or stapling through areas containing foreign matter.
[0146] Fig. 20 illustrates a control system 501 including the microcontroller 500 which is
coupled to the position and speed calculators 416 and 422, the loading unit identification system
440, the user interface 120, the drive motor 200, and a data storage module 502. In addition the
microcontroller 500 may be directly coupled to various sensors (e.g., first and second tissue
sensors 177 and 179, the load switch 230, shaft start position sensor 231, clamp position sensor
232, articulation sensor 235, linear displacement sensor 237, rotational sensor 239, firing rod
rotation sensor 241, motor and battery operating module 412, rotation speed detecting apparatus
418, switches 421, voltage sensor 428, current sensor 430, the interrogator 444, etc.).
[0147] The microcontroller 500 includes internal memory which stores one or more software
applications (e.g., firmware) for controlling the operation and functionality of the instrument 10.
The microcontroller 500 processes input data from the user interface 120 and adjusts the

                                                  35
operation of the instrument 10 in response to the inputs. The adjustments to the instrument 10
may including powering the instrument 10 on or off, speed control by means of voltage
regulation or voltage pulse width modulation, torque limitation by reducing duty cycle or
pulsing the voltage on and off to limit average current delivery during a predetermined period of
time.
[0148] The microcontroller 500 is coupled to the user interface 120 via a user feedback module
504 which is configured to inform the user of operational parameters of the instrument 10. The
user feedback module 504 instructs the user interface 120 to output operational data on the
screen 122. In particular, the outputs from the sensors are transmitted to the microcontroller 500
which then sends feedback to the user instructing the user to select a specific mode, speed or
function for the instrument 10 in response thereto.
[0149] The loading unit identification system 440 instructs the microcontroller 500 which end
effector is on the loading unit. In an embodiment, the control system 501 is capable of storing
information relating to the force applied to firing rod 220 and/or end effector 160, such that
when the loading unit 169 is identified the microcontroller 500 automatically selects the
operating parameters for the instrument 10. This allows for control of the force being applied to
the firing rod 220 so that firing rod 220 can drive the particular end effector 160 that is on the
loading unit in use at the time.
[0150] The microcontroller 500 also analyzes the calculations from the position and speed
calculators 416 and 422 and other sensors to determine the actual position and/or speed of the
firing rod 220 and operating status of components of the instrument 10. The analysis may
include interpretation of the sensed feedback signal from the calculators 416 and 422 to control
the movement of the firing rod 220 and other components of the instrument 10 in response to
the sensed signal. The microcontroller 500 is configured to limit the travel of the firing rod 220
once the firing rod 220 has moved beyond a predetermined point as reported by the position
calculator 416. Additional parameters which may be used by the microcontroller 500 to control
the instrument 10 include motor and/or battery temperature, number of cycles remaining and
used, remaining battery life, tissue thickness, current status of the end effector, transmission and
reception, external device connection status, etc.

                                                   36
 [0151] In one embodiment, the instrument 10 includes various sensors configured to measure
current (e.g., ammeter), voltage (e.g., voltmeter), proximity (e.g., optical sensors), temperature
(e.g., thermocouples, thermistors, etc.), and force (e.g., strain gauges, load cells, etc.) to
determine for loading conditions on the loading unit 169. During operation of the instrument 10
it is desirable to know the forces being exerted by the instrument 10 on the target tissue during
the approximation process and during the firing process. Detection of abnormal loads (e.g.,
outside a predetermined load range) indicates a problem with the instrument 10 and/or clamped
tissue which is communicated to the user.
 [0152] Monitoring of load conditions may be performed by one or more of the following
methods: monitoring speed of the drive motor 200, monitoring torque being applied by the
motor, proximity of jaw members 162 and 164, monitoring temperature of components of the
instrument 10, measuring the load on the firing rod 220 via a strain sensor 185 (Fig. 4) and/or
other load bearing components of the instrument 10. Speed and torque monitoring is discussed
above with respect to Fig. 5 and the speed calculator 422.
 [0153] Measuring the distance between the jaw members 162 and 164 can also be indicative of
load conditions on the end effector 160 and/or the instrument 10. When large amounts of force
are imparted on the jaw members 162 and 164, the jaw members are deflected outwards. The
jaw members 162 and 164 are parallel to each other during normal operation, however, during
deformation, the jaw members are at an angle relative to each other. Thus, measuring the angle
between the jaw members 162 and 164 allows for a determination of the deformation of the jaw
members due to the load being exerted thereon. The jaw members may include strain gauges
 187 and 189 as shown in Fig. 13 to directly measure the load being exerted thereon.
Alternatively, one or more proximity sensors 191 and 193 can be disposed at the distal tips of
the jaw members 162 and 164 to measure the angle therebetween. These measurements are then
transmitted to the microcontroller 500 which analyzes the angle and/or strain measurements and
alerts the user of the stress on the end effector 160.
 [0154] In another embodiment, the firing rod 220 or other load-bearing components include one
or more strain gauges and/or load sensors disposed thereon. Under high strain conditions, the
pressure exerted on the instrument 10 and/or the end effector 160 is translated to the firing rod
220 causing the firing rod 220 to deflect, leading to increased strain thereon. The strain gauges

                                                     37
then report the stress measurements to the microcontroller 500. In another embodiment, a
position, strain or force sensor may be disposed on the clutch plate 302.
[0155] During the approximation process, as the end effector 160 is clamped about tissue, the
sensors disposed in the instrument 10 and/or the end effector 160 indicate to the microprocessor
500 that the end effector 160 is deployed about abnormal tissue (e.g., low or high load
conditions). Low load conditions are indicative of a small amount of tissue being grasped by the
end effector 160 and high load conditions denote that too much tissue and/or a foreign object
(e.g., tube, staple line, clips, etc.) is being grasped. The microprocessor 500 thereafter indicates
to the user via the user interface 120 that a more appropriate loading unit 169 and/or instrument
10 should be chosen.
[0156] During the firing process, the sensors can alert the user of a variety of errors. Sensors
may communicate to the microcontroller 500 that a staple cartridge or a portion of the
instrument 10 is faulty. In addition, the sensors can detect sudden spikes in the force exerted on
the knife, which is indicative of encountering a foreign body. Monitoring of force spikes could
also be used to detect the end of the firing stroke, such as when the firing rod 220 encounters the
end of the stapling cartridge and runs into a hard stop. This hard stop creates a force spike
which is relatively larger than those observed during normal operation of the instrument 10 and
could be used to indicate to the microcontroller that the firing rod 220 has reached the end of
loading unit 169. Measuring of the force spikes can be combined with positional feedback
measurements (e.g., from an encoder, linear variable displacement transducer, linear
potentiometer, etc.) as discussed with respect to position and speed calculators 416 and 422.
This allows for use of various types of staple cartridges (e.g., multiple lengths) with the
instrument 10 without modifying the end effector 160.
[0157] When force spikes are encountered, the instrument 10 notifies the user of the condition
and takes preventative measures by entering a so-called "pulse" or an electronic clutching mode,
which is discussed in more detail below. During this mode the drive motor 200 is controlled to
run only in short bursts to allow for the pressure between the grasped tissue and the end effector
160 to equalize. The electronic clutching limits the torque exerted by the drive motor 200 and
prevents situations where high amounts of current are drawn from the power source 400. This,
in turn, prevents damage to electronic and mechanical components due to overheating which
accompanies overloading and high current draw situations.

                                                 38
[0158] The microcontroller 500 controls the drive motor 200 through a motor driver via a pulse
width modulated control signal. The motor driver is configured to adjust the speed of the drive
motor 200 either in clockwise or counter-clockwise direction. The motor driver is also
configured to switch between a plurality of operational modes which include an electronic motor
braking mode, a constant speed mode, an electronic clutching mode, and a controlled current
activation mode. In electronic braking mode, two terminal of the drive motor 200 are shorted
and the generated back EMF counteracts the rotation of the drive motor 200 allowing for faster
stopping and greater positional precision in adjusting the linear position of the firing rod 220.
[0159] In the constant speed mode, the speed calculator 422 in conjunction with the
microcontroller 500 and/or the motor driver adjust the rotational speed of the drive motor 200 to
ensure constant linear speed of the firing rod 220. The electronic clutching mode involves repeat
engagement and/or disengagement of the clutch 300 from the drive motor 200 in response to
sensed feedback signals from the position and speed calculators 416 and 422. In controlled
current activation mode, the current is either ramped up or down to prevent damaging current
and torque spiked when transitioning between static to dynamic mode to provide for so-called
"soft start" and "soft stop."
[0160] The data storage module 502 records the data from the sensors coupled to the
microcontroller 500. In addition, the data storage module 502 records the identifying code of the
loading unit 169, the status of the end effector 100, number of stapling cycles during the
procedure, etc. The data storage module 502 is also configured to connect to an external device
such as a personal computer, a PDA, a smartphone, a storage device (e.g., Secure Digital card,
Compact Flash card, MemoryStick, etc. through a wireless or wired data port 503. This
allows the data storage module 502 to transmit performance data to the external device for
subsequent analysis and/or storage. The data port 503 also allows for so-called "in the field"
upgrades of firmware of the microcontroller 500.
[0161] A feedback control system 601 is shown in Figs. 15-17. The system includes a feedback
controller 603 which is shown in Figs. 16A-B. The instrument 10 is connected to the feedback
controller 603 via the data port 502 which may be either wired (e.g., Firewire@, USB@, Serial
RS232@, Serial RS485@, USART, Ethemet, etc.) or wireless (e.g., Bluetooth, ANT3@,
KNX@, ZWave, X10@ Wireless USB@, IrDA@, Nanonet, Tiny OS, ZigBee, 802.11
IEEE, and other radio, infrared, UHF, VHF communications and the like).

                                                 39
[0162] With reference to Fig. 15, the feedback controller 603 is configured to store the data
transmitted thereto by the instrument 10 as well as process and analyze the data. The feedback
controller 603 is also connected to other devices, such as a video display 604, a video processor
605 and a computing device 606 (e.g., a personal computer, a PDA, a smartphone, a storage
device, etc.). The video processor 605 is used for processing output data generated by the
feedback controller 603 for output on the video display 604. The computing device 606 is used
for additional processing of the feedback data. In one embodiment, the results of the sensor
feedback analysis performed by the microcontroller 600 may be stored internally for later
retrieval by the computing device 606.
[0163] The feedback controller 603 includes a data port 607 (Fig. 16B) coupled to the
microcontroller 600 which allows the feedback controller 603 to be connected to the computing
device 606. The data port 607 may provide for wired and/or wireless communication with the
computing device 606 providing for an interface between the computing device 606 and the
feedback controller 603 for retrieval of stored feedback data, configuration of operating
parameters of the feedback controller 603 and upgrade of firmware and/or other software of the
feedback controller 603.
[0164] The feedback controller 603 is further illustrated in Figs. 16A-B. The feedback controller
603 includes a housing 610 and a plurality of input and output ports, such as a video input 614, a
video output 616, a heads-up ("HUD") display output 618. The feedback controller 603 also
includes a screen 620 for displaying status information concerning the feedback controller 603.
[0165] Components of the feedback controller 603 are shown in Fig. 17. The feedback
controller 603 includes a microcontroller 600 and a data storage module 602. The
microcontroller 600 and the data storage module 602 provide a similar functionality as the
microcontroller 500 and the data storage module 502 of the instrument 10. Providing these
components in a stand-alone module, in the form of the feedback controller 603, alleviates the
need to have these components within the instrument 10.
[0166] The data storage module 602 may include one or more internal and/or external storage
devices, such as magnetic hard drives, flash memory (e.g., Secure Digital card, Compact
Flash card, MemoryStick, etc.) The data storage module 602 is used by the feedback
controller 603 to store feedback data from the instrument 10 for later analysis of the data by the

                                                 40
computing device 606. The feedback data includes information supplied by the sensors disposed
within the instrument 10 and the like.
[0167] The microcontroller 600 is configured to supplant and/or supplement the control
circuitry, if present, of the instrument 10. The microcontroller 600 includes internal memory
which stores one or more software application (e.g., firmware) for controlling the operation and
functionality of the instrument 10. The microcontroller 600 processes input data from the user
interface 120 and adjusts the operation of the instrument 10 in response to the inputs. The
microcontroller 600 is coupled to the user interface 120 via a user feedback module 504 which
is configured to inform the user of operational parameters of the instrument 10. More
specifically, the instrument 10 is configured to connect to the feedback controller 603 wirelessly
or through a wired connection via a data port 407 (Fig. 5).
[0168] In a disclosed embodiment, the microcontroller 600 is connected to the drive motor 200
and is configured and arranged to monitor the battery impedance, voltage, temperature and/or
current draw and to control the operation of the instrument 10. The load or loads on battery 400,
transmission, drive motor 200 and drive components of the instrument 10 are determined to
control a motor speed if the load or loads indicate a damaging limitation is reached or
approached. For example, the energy remaining in battery 400, the number of firings remaining,
whether battery 400 must be replaced or charged, and/or approaching the potential loading
limits of the instrument 10 may be determined. The microcontroller 600 may also be connected
to one or more of the sensors of the instrument 10 discussed above.
[0169] The microcontroller 600 is also configured to control the operation of drive motor 200 in
response to the monitored information. Pulse modulation control schemes, which may include
an electronic clutch, may be used in controlling the instrument 10. For example, the
microcontroller 600 can regulate the voltage supply of the drive motor 200 or supply a pulse
modulated signal thereto to adjust the power and/or torque output to prevent system damage or
optimize energy usage.
[0170] In one embodiment, an electric braking circuit may be used for controlling drive motor
200, which uses the existing back electromotive force of rotating drive motor 200 to counteract
and substantially reduce the momentum of drive tube 210. The electric braking circuit may
improve the control of drive motor 200 and/or drive tube 210 for stopping accuracy and/or shift

                                                 41
location of powered surgical instrument 10. Sensors for monitoring components of powered
surgical instrument 10 and to help prevent overloading of powered surgical instrument 10 may
include thermal-type sensors, such as thermal sensors, thermistors, thermopiles, thermo-couples
and/or thermal infrared imaging and provide feedback to the microcontroller 600. The
microcontroller 600 may control the components of powered surgical instrument 10 in the event
that limits are reached or approached and such control can include cutting off the power from
the power source 400, temporarily interrupting the power or going into a pause mode and/or
pulse modulation to limit the energy used. The microcontroller 600 can also monitor the
temperature of components to determine when operation can be resumed. The above uses of the
microcontroller 600 may be used independently of or factored with current, voltage, temperature
and/or impedance measurements.
[0171] The result of the analysis and processing of the data by the microcontroller 600 is output
on video display 604 and/or the HUD display 622. The video display 604 may be any type of
display such as an LCD screen, a plasma screen, electroluminescent screen and the like. In one
embodiment, the video display 604 may include a touch screen and may incorporate resistive,
surface wave, capacitive, infrared, strain gauge, optical, dispersive signal or acoustic pulse
recognition touch screen technologies. The touch screen may be used to allow the user to
provide input while viewing operational feedback. The HUD display 622 may be projected onto
any surface visible to the user during surgical procedures, such as lenses of a pair of glasses
and/or goggles, a face shield, and the like. This allows the user to visualize vital feedback
information from the feedback controller 603 without loosing focus on the procedure.
[0172] The feedback controller 603 includes an on-screen display module 624 and a HUD
module 626. The modules 626 process the output of the microcontroller 600 for display on the
respective displays 604 and 622. More specifically, the OSD module 624 overlays text and/or
graphical information from the feedback controller 603 over other video images received from
the surgical site via cameras disposed therein. The modified video signal having overlaid text is
transmitted to the video display 604 allowing the user to visualize useful feedback information
from the instrument 10 and/or feedback controller 603 while still observing the surgical site.
[0173] Figs. 24-25 illustrate another embodiment of the instrument 10'. The instrument 10'
includes a power source 400' having a plurality of cells 401 arranged in a straight configuration.
The power source 400' is inserted vertically into a vertical battery chamber 800 within the

                                                 42
handle portion 112. The battery chamber 800 includes a spring 802 within the top portion
thereof to push downward the power source 400'. In one embodiment, the spring 802 may
include contacts to electrically couple with the power source 400'. The power source 400' is
held within the battery chamber 800 via a battery cap 804 which is configured to slide in a distal
direction to lock in place. The cap 804 and the handle 112 may include tongue and groove
couplings to keep the cap 804 from sliding out. The power source 400' is biased against the cap
804 due to the downward force of the spring 802. As the cap 804 is slid in a proximal direction,
the power source 400' is ejected from the battery chamber 800 by the spring 802.
[0174] Fig. 25 shows another embodiment of the rotational sensor 239 which detects the
rotation of the drive tube 210, thus, measuring the rate of rotation of the drive tube 210 which
allows for determination of the linear velocity of the firing rod 220. The rotational sensor 239
includes an encoder wheel 810 mounted to drive tube 210 and an optical reader 812 (e.g., photo
interrupter). The optical reader 812 is configured to determine the number of interruptions in a
light beam which is continuously provided between two opposing edges 814 and 816 thereof.
The wheel 810 rotates with the drive tube 210 and includes a plurality of slits 811 therethrough.
[0175] The outer edge of the wheel 810 is disposed between the opposing edges of the optical
reader 812 such that the light being transmitted between the edges 814 and 816 shine through
the slits 811. In other words, the light beam between the edges 814 and 816 is interrupted by the
wheel 810 as the drive tube 210 is rotated. The optical reader 812 measures the number of
interruptions in the light beam and rate of occurrences thereof and transmits these measurements
to the speed calculator 422 which then determines the speed of the drive rod 220 as discussed
above.
[0176] Fig. 27-32 show the instrument 10' having a retraction assembly 820 for retracting the
firing rod 220 from its fired position. The retraction assembly 820 provides for a manually
driven mechanical interface with the drive tube 210 allowing for manual retraction of the firing
rod 210 via ratcheting action of the retraction assembly 820 in emergency situations (e.g.,
electrical malfunction, stuck end effector 160, etc.). The retraction assembly 820 may be
configured as a modular assembly which can be inserted into the instrument 10'.
[0177] With reference to Fig. 30, the retraction assembly 820 includes a retraction chassis 822
having top portion 823 and a bottom portion 825. The retraction assembly 820 interfaces

                                                   43
mechanically with the drive tube 210 via a drive gear 826 and a retraction gear 824. The drive
gear 826 is attached to the drive tube 210 and is translated in response to the rotation of the drive
tube 210. Conversely, rotation of the drive gear 826 imparts rotation on the drive tube 210. The
drive gear 826 and the retraction gear 824 may be bevel gears allowing the gears 824 and 826 to
interface in a perpendicular manner.
[0178] The retraction gear 824 is coupled to a first spindle 828 which is disposed in a
substantially perpendicular manner between the top and bottom portions 823 and 825 of the
retraction chassis 822 and is rotatable around a longitudinal axis defined thereby. The first
spindle 828 further includes a first spur gear 830 attached thereto and to the retraction gear 824.
The first spur gear 830 interfaces with a second spur gear 832 disposed on a second spindle 834
which is also is disposed in a substantially perpendicular manner between the top and bottom
portions 823 and 825 of the retraction chassis 822 and is rotatable around a longitudinal axis
defined thereby.
[0179] The second spur gear 832 interfaces mechanically with a third spur gear 836 which is
disposed on the first spindle 828. The third spur gear 836 is attached to a first clutch portion
838 of a unidirectional clutch assembly 840. The clutch assembly 840 further includes a second
clutch portion 840 rotatably disposed on the first spindle 828 above the first clutch portion 838
with a spring 843 disposed between the first and second clutch portions 838 and 840 thereby
keeping the first and second clutch portions 838 and 840 in a raised non-interlocking
configuration (e.g., first configuration) as shown in Fig. 31.
[0180] Rotation of the drive tube 210 and/or the drive gear 826 imparts rotation on the retraction
gear 824 and the first, second and third spur gears 830, 832 and 836 along with the first portion
838 and the respective spindles 828 and 834. Since, the second clutch portion 842 can rotate
about the spindle 828 and is separated from the first clutch portion 838 by the spring 843, the
rotation of the first portion 838 is not translated thereto.
[0181] The first and second clutch portions 838 and 842 include a plurality of interlocking teeth
844 having a flat interlocking surface 846 and a sloping slip surface 848. In a second
configuration as shown in Fig. 32, the second clutch portion 842 is pushed downwards by a
retraction lever 845 thereby interfacing the teeth 844. The slip surfaces 848 allow for the

                                                  44
interlocking surfaces 846 to come in contact with each other thereby allowing rotation of the
second clutch portion 842 to rotate the first clutch portion 838 and all of the interfacing gears.
[0182] The retraction lever 845 includes a camming portion 847 and a handle 849 attached
thereto. The camming portion 847 includes an opening 853 which houses a unidirectional
needle clutch 855 which is mechanical cooperation with a fitting 856 attached to the first spindle
828 thereby allowing the retraction lever 845 to rotate about the first spindle 828. With
reference to Fig. 29, the lever 845 includes a one or more camming members 850 having a
camming surface 852. In the first configuration, the lever 845 is disposed along a lever pocket
860 of the housing 110 as shown in Fig. 27. The lever 845 is pushed up by the spring 843
against the top portion 823 and the camming members 850 are disposed within corresponding
cam pockets 858. The lever 845 is maintained in the first configuration by a return extension
spring 862 mounted between the top portion 823 and the camping portion 847. The camming
members 850 and the lever pocket 860 prevent further rotation of the lever 845.
[0183] As the lever 845 is pulled out of the lever pocket 860, the camming members 850
interface with the corresponding cam pockets 823 and push the camming portion 847 of the
lever 845 in a downward direction. The downward movement compresses the spring 843 and
pushes the first and second clutch portions 838 and 842 together interlocking the teeth 844
thereby engaging the portions 838 and 842. Rotation of the camming portion 847 in a
counterclockwise direction actuates the needle clutch 855 which interfaces with the fitting 856
and the first spindle 828. Continual rotation of the lever 845 rotates the clutch assembly 840
which in turn rotates the spur gears 836, 832 and 830 and the retraction and drive gears 824 and
826. This in turn rotates drive tube 210 and retracts the drive rod 220.
[0184] The lever 845 can be rotated for a predetermined amount until the handle 849 abuts the
housing 110 as shown in Fig. 28. Thereafter, the lever 845 is brought back to its first
configuration by the return extension spring 862. This raises the camming portion 847 allowing
the second clutch portion 842 to also move upward and disengage the first clutch portion 838.
The needle clutch 855 releases the fitting 856 allowing the lever 845 to return to the first
configuration without affecting the movement of the drive tube 210. Once the lever 845 is
returned to the first configuration, the lever 845 may be retracted once again to continue to
ratchet the driving rod 220.

[0185] Referring to Figs. 33A through 33L (and corresponding Figs. 37A through 37L), the
successful firing of any of the powered surgical instruments described herein may yield
predictable waveforms when plotting the current (I) being drawn by the motor against time. For
instance, Fig. 33A (and Fig. 37A) depicts waveforms 910 that are obtained by firing 15 full
rows of staples from a 60 mm long, 3.5 mm (staple height), staple cartridge using a powered
surgical instrument through synthetic tissue, canine tissue, or red foam. As shown in Fig. 33A
(and Fig. 37A), each successful firing of a row of staples yields a peak 912 in waveforms 910.
[0186] Fig. 33B (and Fig. 37B) depicts the current drawn by the motor during a clamping and
compression procedure of synthetic and canine tissue. Fig. 33C (and Fig. 37C) depicts the
current drawn by the motor during a stapling procedure. As shown in Fig. 33C (and Fig. 37C),
the current needed for proper staple formation in stomach tissue is greater than the current
needed for intestinal tissue. Fig. 33D (and Fig. 37D) depicts the current drawn by the motor
during a knife retraction procedure.
[0187] Fig. 33E (and Fig. 37E) depicts the current drawn by a motor for three separate staple
cartridges 930, 932, 934. Staple cartridge 930 was missing 12 staples, staple cartridge 932 was
missing 6 staples, and staple cartridge 934 was not missing any staples. As shown in Fig. 33E
(and Fig. 37E), when there are missing staples in one of the staple cartrides, the current drop is
notable as shown in region 922, which corresponds to staple cartridge 932, and region 924,
which corresponds to staple cartridge 930.
[0188] Fig. 33F (and Fig. 37F) depicts the current drawn by a motor during a stapling procedure
performed on various types of stomach tissue. As shown in Fig. 33F (and Fig. 37F), porcine
stomach tissue draws more current than canine stomach tissue. Fig. 33G (and Fig. 37G) depicts
the current drawn by a motor during a stapling procedure performed on various types of
intestinal tissue. Fig. 33H (and Fig. 37H) depicts the current drawn by a motor during a stapling
procedure performed on various types of synthetic intestinal tissue and canine intestinal tissue.
Fig. 331 (and Fig. 371) depicts the current drawn by a motor during a stapling procedure
performed on red foam having different thicknesses.
[0189] Fig. 33J (and Fig. 37J) depicts the current drawn by a motor during a stapling procedure
performed on red foam and in vivo canine tissue. As seen in Fig. 33J (and Fig. 37J), organic
tissue behaves differently than red foam. While the force needed to staple red foam is consistent

                                                  46
through firing, the force to staple the in vivo canine tissue varies. Fig. 33K (and Fig. 37K)
depicts the current drawn by the motor on different tissue analogs. Fig. 33L (and Fig. 37L)
depicts linear force the tissue experiences during a stapling procedure as the tissue is
compressed and then stapled.
[0190] Referring to Fig. 34, the powered surgical instrument may include a surgical fastener
detection system 1001 that includes the microcontroller 500, the data storage module 502, the
data port 503, the user feedback module 504, the user interface 120, and the drive motor 200. In
addition, system 1001 may also include a current sensor 1010 and a position calculator 1012.
[0191] The data storage module 502 stores data from successful firing procedures (e.g., the
waveform shown in Figs. 33A-33L, and Figs. 37A-37L) which is used by the microcontroller
500 to determine whether each surgical fastener or row of fasteners are successfully deployed.
The data may be previously stored in the data storage module 502 by a manufacturer, uploaded
by a user, or saved from a previous operation of the powered surgical instrument where all of
the surgical fasteners were correctly deployed.
[0192] In one embodiment of the present disclosure, the current sensor 1010 measures the
current draw on the motor 200 and provides the current draw as a signal to the microcontroller
500. The microcontroller 500 compares the signal from the current sensor 1010 to the
successful firing data stored in the data module 502. If the signal from the current sensor 1010
is within an acceptable tolerance window when compared to the data from successful firing
procedures, the microcontroller 500 may report a successful surgical fastener deployment to a
user via screen 122 or visual outputs 123 in user interface 120. If the signal from the current
sensor 1010 is not within an acceptable tolerance window when compared to the data from
successful firing procedures, the microcontroller 500 may report a unsuccessful surgical fastener
deployment to a user via screen 122 or visual outputs 123 in user interface 120. Further, the
powered surgical instrument may power down preventing further operation of the instrument.
The data from the current firing procedure may be stored in data storage module 502 or stored in
a separate computer via data port 503.
[0193] As shown above in the Fig. 33A-33L (and 37A-37L), different tissues require different
current draws on the motor. Therefore, in the embodiments disclosed herein, a user may select
the type of tissue involved during a procedure and the microcontroller 500 will determine the

                                                  47
appropriate successful firing data to be used by microcontroller 500 to determine whether there
is a successful surgical fastener deployment.
 [0194] The system 1001 may record the current draw (I) of the motor 200 vs. the distance (x)
that the firing rod 220 (Fig. 5) travels. Distance (x) may be obtained via position calculator
 1016 which may include an optical or magnetic encoder, a linear variable differential
transformer (LVDT), limit switch, or any other positioning method. Position calculator 1016
may also calculate the distance that the firing rod 220 travels in a manner similar to that
described above with respect to position calculator 416.
 [0195] Fig. 35 depicts an example of a current sensor arrangement that may be used to obtain
the current draw on motor 200. As shown in Fig. 35, a shunt resistor RSHUNT of known value is
placed in series between the common source of metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect
transistors Q2 and Q4 and ground. Microcontroller 500 reads the voltage drop across RSHUNT
and calculates the current via Ohm's law (I=V/RsHUNT).     The microprocessor 500 then uses the
calculated current value and a tolerance value to determine whether the surgical fastener has
been correctly deployed.
 [0196] Fig. 36 is a flow chart diagram illustrating an example of a method that may be used for
the detection of successful deployment of one or more surgical fasteners. As shown in Fig. 36,
the method starts with step 1110 where a surgical fastener is fired and then the current draw on
motor 200 is measured in step 1112. The detected current draw is compared to data from a
successful firing procedure (DatasFP)- If the detected current draw is within an acceptable
tolerance window when compared to DatasFP the process proceeds to step 1117 where a
determination is made as to whether or not all surgical fasteners have been fired. If there is a
need for more surgical fasteners, the method starts again in step 1110. If there are no more
surgical fasteners that need to be fired, the method ends in step 1120. In step 1116, if the
detected current draw is not within an acceptable tolerance window when compared to DatasFP
the process proceeds to step 1118 where the user is informed of the error (i.e., staple misfire,
jam, etc.). This method may be employed individually or in conjunction with any other method
described herein.
 [0197] It will be understood that various modifications may be made to the embodiments shown
herein. Therefore, the above description should not be construed as limiting, but merely as

                                                48
exemplifications of preferred embodiments. Those skilled in the art will envision other
modifications within the scope and spirit of the present disclosure.
