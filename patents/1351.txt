  SALTS OF AN EPIDERMAL GROWTH FACTOR RECEPTOR KINASE INHIBITOR
                          CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED CASES
[0001]       The present application claims priority to United States provisional application serial
number 61/611,400, filed March 15, 2012, the entirety of which is hereby incorporated by
reference. This is a divisional of Australian Patent Application No. <removed-apn>, the entire
contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.
                                  FIELD OF THE INVENTION
[0002]       The present invention provides salt forms of a compound useful as mutant-selective
inhibitors of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) kinase, including polymorphic forms of
certain salts. The invention also provides pharmaceutically acceptable compositions comprising
salt forms of the present invention and methods of using the compositions in the treatment of
various disorders.
                             BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
[0003]       Protein tyrosine kinases are a class of enzymes that catalyze the transfer of a
phosphate group from ATP or GTP to a tyrosine residue located on a protein substrate. Receptor
tyrosine kinases act to transmit signals from the outside of a cell to the inside by activating
secondary messaging effectors via a phosphorylation event. A variety of cellular processes are
promoted by these signals, including proliferation, carbohydrate utilization, protein synthesis,
angiogenesis, cell growth, and cell survival.
[0004]       There is strong precedent for involvement of the EGFR in human cancer because over
60% of all solid tumors overexpress at least one of these proteins or their ligands.
Overexpression of EGFR is commonly found in breast, lung, head and neck, bladder tumors.
[0005]       Activating mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of EGFR have been identified in
patients with non-small cell lung cancer (Lin, N. U.; Winer, E. P., Breast Cancer Res 6: 204-210,
2004). The reversible inhibitors Tarceva (erlotinib) and Iressa (gefitinib) currently are first-line
therapy for non-small cell lung cancer patients with activating mutations. The most common
activating mutations are L858R and delE746-A750.

                                               -2
[0006]      Additionally, in the majority of patients that relapse, acquired drug resistance, such as
by mutation of gatekeeper residue T790M, has been detected in at least half of such clinically
resistant patients. Moreover, T790M may also be pre-existing; there may be an independent,
oncogenic role for the T790M mutation. For example, there are patients with the L858R/T790M
mutation who never received gefitinib treatment. In addition, germline EGFR T790M mutations
are linked with certain familial lung cancers.
[0007]      Current drugs in development, including second-generation covalent inhibitors, such
as BIBW2992, HKI-272 and PF-0299804, are effective against the T790M resistance mutation
but exhibit dose-limiting toxicities due to concurrent inhibition of WT EGFR.           Accordingly,
there remains a need to find mutant-selective EGFR kinase inhibitors useful as therapeutic
agents.
                               SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
[0008]      It has now been found that the novel benzenesulfonic acid, camphor sulfonic acid,
1,2-ethane disulfonic acid, hydrobromic acid, hydrochloric acid, maleic acid, methanesulfonic
acid, naphthalene-2-sulfonic acid, 1,5-naphthalene disulfonic acid, oxalic acid, 4-toluenesulfonic
acid or 2,4,6-trihydroxybenzoic acid salts of the present invention, and compositions thereof, are
useful as mutant-selective inhibitors of one or more EGFR kinases and exhibits desirable
characteristics   for the same.     In general, these salts, and pharmaceutically          acceptable
compositions thereof, are useful for treating or lessening the severity of a variety of diseases or
disorders as described in detail herein.

[0098]       Compound 1 is active in a variety of assays and therapeutic models demonstrating
selective covalent, irreversible inhibition of mutant EGFR kinase (in enzymatic and cellular
assays).    Notably, compound 1 was found to inhibit human non-small cell lung cancer cell
proliferation both in vitro and in vivo.    Accordingly, compound 1 and its salts are useful for
treating one or more disorders associated with activity of mutant EGFR kinase.
[0099]       It would be desirable to provide a form of compound 1 that, as compared to
compound 1, imparts characteristics such as improved aqueous solubility, stability and ease of

invention.
Solid Forms of Compound 2:
[00105]     It has been found that compound 2 can exist in a variety of solid forms. Such forms
include polymorphs and amorphous forms.           The solid forms can be solvates, hydrates and
unsolvated forms of compound 2. All such forms are contemplated by the present invention. In

                                              - 10
certain embodiments, the present invention provides compound 2 as a mixture of one or more
solid forms of compound 2.
[00106]      As used herein, the term "polymorph" refers to the different crystal structures (of
solvated or unsolvated forms) in which a compound can crystallize.
[00107]      As used herein, the term "solvate" refers to a crystal form with either a stoichiometric
or non-stoichiometric amount of solvent. For polymorphs, the solvent is incorporated into the
crystal structure. Similarly, the term "hydrate" refers to a solid form with either a stoichiometric
or non-stoichiometric amount of water. For polymorphs, the water is incorporated into the
crystal structure.
[00108]      As used herein, the term "about", when used in reference to a degree 2-theta value
refers to the stated value ± 0.3 degree 2-theta (020). In certain embodiments, "about" refers to
0.2 degree 2-theta or ± 0.1 degree 2-theta.
[00109]      In certain embodiments, compound 2 is a crystalline solid. In other embodiments,
compound 2 is a crystalline solid substantially free of amorphous compound 2. As used herein,
the term "substantially free of amorphous compound 2" means that the compound contains no

[00145]      In certain embodiments, the resulting mixture containing Compound 2 is cooled. In
other embodiments, the mixture containing Compound 2 is cooled below 20 'C, such as below
10 0 C.
[00146]      In certain embodiments, Compound 2 precipitates from the mixture.               In another
embodiment, Compound 2 crystallizes from the mixture. In other embodiments, Compound 2
crystallizes from solution following seeding of the solution (i.e., adding crystals of Compound 2

Uses, Formulation and Administration
Pharmaceutically Acceptable Compositions
[00151]      According to another embodiment, the invention provides a composition comprising
Compound 2 and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, adjuvant, or vehicle. The amount of
Compound 2 in compositions of this invention it is such that is effective to measurably inhibit a
protein kinase, particularly an EGFR kinase, or a mutant thereof, in a biological sample or in a
patient. In certain embodiments, a composition of this invention is formulated for administration

                                               -  30
to a patient in need of such composition. In some embodiments, a composition of this invention
is formulated for oral administration to a patient.
[00152]     The term "patient", as used herein, means an animal, preferably a mammal, and most
preferably a human.
[00153]     The term "pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, adjuvant, or vehicle" refers to a non
toxic carrier, adjuvant, or vehicle that does not destroy the pharmacological activity of the
compound with which it is formulated.            Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, adjuvants or
vehicles that may be used in the compositions of this invention include, but are not limited to,
ion exchangers, alumina, aluminum stearate, lecithin, serum proteins, such as human serum
albumin, buffer substances such as phosphates, glycine, sorbic acid, potassium sorbate, partial
glyceride mixtures of saturated vegetable fatty acids, water, salts or electrolytes, such as
protamine sulfate, disodium hydrogen phosphate, potassium hydrogen phosphate, sodium
chloride, zinc salts, colloidal silica, magnesium trisilicate, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, cellulose-based
substances, polyethylene glycol, Vitamin E polyethylene glycol succinate (d-alpha tocopheryl
polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate),        sodium carboxymethylcellulose, polyacrylates, waxes,
polyethylene-polyoxypropylene-block polymers, gelatine, polyvinyl pyrrolidone vinyl acetate,
hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, madnesium stearate, steric acid, citric acid, mannitol, and wool
fat.
[00154]     Compositions of the present invention may be administered orally, parenterally, by
inhalation spray, topically, rectally, nasally, buccally, vaginally or via an implanted reservoir.
The term "parenteral" as used herein includes subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, intra
articular, intra-synovial, intrasternal, intrathecal, intrahepatic, intralesional and intracranial
injection or infusion techniques.         Preferably, the compositions are administered orally,
intraperitoneally or intravenously. Sterile injectable forms of the compositions of this invention
may be an aqueous or oleaginous suspension. These suspensions may be formulated according
to techniques known in the art using suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents.
The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non
toxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, for example as a solution in 1,3-butanediol.
Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution

                                              -31
and isotonic sodium chloride solution.         In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally
employed as a solvent or suspending medium.
[00155]     For this purpose, any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono- or
di-glycerides.   Fatty acids, such as oleic acid and its glyceride derivatives are useful in the
preparation of injectables, as are natural pharmaceutically-acceptable oils, such as olive oil or
castor oil, especially in their polyoxyethylated versions. These oil solutions or suspensions may
also contain a long-chain alcohol diluent or dispersant, such as carboxymethyl cellulose or
similar dispersing agents that are commonly used in the formulation of pharmaceutically
acceptable dosage forms including emulsions and suspensions.                Other commonly used
surfactants, such as Tweens, Spans and other emulsifying agents or bioavailability enhancers
which are commonly used in the manufacture of pharmaceutically acceptable solid, liquid, or
other dosage forms may also be used for the purposes of formulation.
[00156]     Pharmaceutically     acceptable  compositions    of this    invention may      be  orally
administered in any orally acceptable dosage form including, but not limited to, capsules, tablets,
aqueous and non-aqueous suspensions or solutions. In the case of tablets for oral use, carriers
commonly used include lactose and corn starch. Lubricating agents, such as magnesium stearate,
are also typically added.      For oral administration in a capsule form, useful diluents include
lactose and dried cornstarch. When aqueous suspensions are required for oral use, the active
ingredient is typically combined with emulsifying and suspending agents.          If desired, certain
sweetening, flavoring or coloring agents may also be added.
[00157]     Alternatively, pharmaceutically acceptable compositions of this invention may be
administered in the form of suppositories for rectal administration. These can be prepared by
mixing the agent with a suitable non-irritating excipient that is solid at room temperature but
liquid at rectal temperature and therefore will melt in the rectum to release the drug.         Such
materials include cocoa butter, beeswax and polyethylene glycols.
[00158]     Pharmaceutically acceptable compositions of this invention may also be administered
topically, especially when the target of treatment includes areas or organs readily accessible by
topical application, including diseases of the eye, the skin, or the lower intestinal tract. Suitable
topical formulations are readily prepared for each of these areas or organs.

                                             -32
[00159]     Topical application for the lower intestinal tract can be effected in a rectal
suppository formulation (see above) or in a suitable enema formulation. Topically-transdermal
patches may also be used.
[00160]     For topical applications, provided pharmaceutically acceptable compositions may be
formulated in a suitable ointment containing the active component suspended or dissolved in one
or more carriers. Carriers for topical administration of Compound 2 include, but are not limited
to, mineral oil, liquid petrolatum, white petrolatum, propylene glycol, polyoxyethylene,
polyoxypropylene      compound,    emulsifying    wax   and   water.      Alternatively,  provided
pharmaceutically acceptable compositions can be formulated in a suitable lotion or cream
containing the active components suspended or dissolved in one or more pharmaceutically
acceptable carriers.    Suitable carriers include, but are not limited to, mineral oil, sorbitan
monostearate, polysorbate 60, cetyl esters wax, cetearyl alcohol, 2-octyldodecanol, benzyl
alcohol and water.
[00161]     For ophthalmic use, provided pharmaceutically acceptable compositions may be
formulated as micronized suspensions in isotonic, pH adjusted sterile saline, or, preferably, as
solutions in isotonic, pH adjusted sterile saline, either with or without a preservative such as
benzylalkonium chloride. Alternatively, for ophthalmic uses, the pharmaceutically acceptable
compositions may be formulated in an ointment such as petrolatum.
[00162]     Pharmaceutically acceptable compositions of this invention may also be administered
by nasal aerosol or inhalation. Such compositions are prepared according to techniques well
known in the art of pharmaceutical formulation and may be prepared as solutions in saline,
employing benzyl alcohol or other suitable preservatives, absorption promoters to enhance
bioavailability, fluorocarbons, and/or other conventional solubilizing or dispersing agents.
[00163]     In some embodiments, pharmaceutically acceptable compositions of this invention
are formulated for oral administration.
[00164]     The amount of Compound 2 that may be combined with the carrier materials to
produce a composition in a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host treated, the
particular mode of administration.        In certain embodiments, provided compositions are
formulated so that a dosage of between 0.01 - 100 mg/kg body weight/day of Compound 2 can
be administered to a patient receiving these compositions.

                                              - 33
[00165]      It should also be understood that a specific dosage and treatment regimen for any
particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors, including the activity of the specific
compound employed, the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, time of administration, rate
of excretion, drug combination, and the judgment of the treating physician and the severity of the
particular disease being treated.
Uses of Compounds and Pharmaceutically Acceptable Compositions
[00166]      Compound 2 and compositions described herein are generally useful for the inhibition
of protein kinase activity of one or more enzymes. Examples of kinases that are inhibited by
Compound 2 and compositions described herein and against which the methods described herein
are useful include EGFR kinase or a mutant thereof. It has been found that Compound 2 is a
selective inhibitor of at least one mutation of EGFR, as compared to wild-type ("WT") EGFR.
In certain embodiments, an at least one mutation of EGFR is T790M. In certain embodiments,
the at least one mutation of EGFR is a deletion mutation. In some embodiments, the at least one
mutation of EGFR is an activating mutation. In certain embodiments, Compound 2 selectively
inhibits at least one resistant mutation and at least one activating mutation as compared to WT
EGFR. In some embodiments, Compound 2 selectively inhibits at least one deletion mutation
and/or at least one point mutation, and is sparing as to WT EGFR inhibition.
[00167]      A mutation of EGFR can be selected from T790M (resistant or oncogenic), L858R
(activating), delE746-A750 (activating), G719S (activating), or a combination thereof.
[00168]      As used herein, the term "selectively inhibits," as used in comparison to inhibition of
WT EGFR, means that Compound 2 inhibits at least one mutation of EGFR (i.e., at least one
deletion mutation, at least one activating mutation, at least one restistant mutation, or a
combination of at least one deletion mutation and at least one point mutation) in at least one
assay described herein (e.g., biochemical or cellular).          In some embodiments, the term
"selectively inhibits," as used in comparison to WT EGFR inhibition means that Compound 2 is
at least 50 times more potent, at least 45 times, at least 40, at least 35, at least 30, at least 25, or
at least 20 times more potent as an inhibitor of at least one mutation of EGFR, as defined and
described herein, as compared to WT EGFR.

                                               - 34
[00169]     As used herein, the term "sparing as to WT EGFR" means that a selective inhibitor of
at least one mutation of EGFR, as defined and described above and herein, inhibits EGFR at the
upper limit of detection of at least one assay, such as those described in the '061 application
(e.g., biochemical or cellular as described in detail in Examples 56-58). In vitro assays include
assays that determine inhibition of the phosphorylation activity and/or the subsequent functional
consequences, or ATPase activity of activated EGFR (WT or mutant). Alternate in vitro assays
quantitate the ability of the inhibitor to bind to EGFR (WT or mutant). Inhibitor binding may be
measured by radiolabeling the inhibitor prior to binding, isolating the inhibitor/EGFR (WT or
mutant) complex and determining the amount of radiolabel bound.               Alternatively, inhibitor
binding may be determined by running a competition experiment where new inhibitors are
incubated with EGFR (WT or mutant) bound to known radioligands. In some embodiments, the
term "sparing as to WT EGFR" means that Compound 2 inhibits WT EGFR with an IC 50 of at
least 10 tM, at least 9 pM, at least 8 pLM, at least 7 pM, at least 6 pM, at least 5 pM, at least 3
pM, at least 2 pM, or at least 1 pM.
[00170]     In certain embodiments, Compound 2 selectively inhibits (a) at least one activating
mutation; and (b) T790M; and (c) is sparing as to WT. In some embodiments, an at least one
activating mutation is a deletion mutation. In some embodiments, an at least one activating
mutation is a point mutation. In some embodiments, an activating mutation is delE746-A750. In
some embodiments, an activating mutation is L858R.            In some embodiments, an activating
mutation is G719S.
[00171]     In some embodiments, the at least one mutation of EGFR is L858R and/or T790M.
[00172]     Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, it is believed that
administration of Compound 2 to a patient having at least one activating mutation may preempt
formation of the T790M resistance mutation.           Thus, in certain embodiments, the present
invention provides a method for inhibiting an activating mutation in a patient comprising
administering to the patient Compound 2 or composition thereof, as described herein.
[00173]     One of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that certain patients have an oncogenic
form of the T790M mutation, i.e., the T790M mutation is present prior to administrating any
EGFR kinase inhibitor to a patient and is therefore oncogenic.                Accordingly, in some
embodiments, the present invention provides a method for inhibiting oncogenic T790M in a

                                             -  35
patient comprising administering to the patient a provided compound or composition thereof, as
described herein.
[00174]     In certain embodiments, the amount of Compound 2 in a composition is effective to
measurably inhibit at least one mutant of EGFR selectively as compared to WT EGFR and other
protein kinases (e.g., ErbB2, ErbB4, a TEC-kinase, and/or JAK3), in a biological sample or in a
patient.
[00175]     As used herein, the terms "treatment," "treat," and "treating" refer to reversing,
alleviating, delaying the onset of, or inhibiting the progress of a disease or disorder, or one or
more symptoms thereof, as described herein.            In some embodiments, treatment may be
administered after one or more symptoms have developed. In other embodiments, treatment may
be administered in the absence of symptoms. For example, treatment may be administered to a
susceptible individual prior to the onset of symptoms (e.g., in light of a history of symptoms
and/or in light of genetic or other susceptibility factors). Treatment may also be continued after
symptoms have resolved, for example to prevent or delay their recurrence.
[00176]     Compound 2 is an inhibitor of at least one mutant of EGFR and is therefore useful for
treating one or more disorders associated with activity of one of more EGFR mutants (e.g., a
deletion mutation, an activating mutation, a resistant mutation, or combination thereof). Thus, in
certain embodiments, the present invention provides a method for treating a mutant EGFR
mediated disorder comprising the step of administering to a patient in need thereof Compound 2
or pharmaceutically acceptable composition thereof.
[00177]     As used herein, the term "mutant EGFR-mediated" disorders or conditions as used
herein means any disease or other deleterious condition in which at least one mutant of EGFR is
known to play a role. In certain embodiments, an at least one mutant of EGFR is T790M. In
some embodiments, the at least one mutant of EGFR is a deletion mutation.                In certain
embodiments, the at least one mutant of EGFR is an activating mutation. In some embodiments,
the at least one mutant of EGFR is L858R and/or T790M. In certain embodiments, a provided
compound selectively inhibits (a) at least one activating mutation, (b) T790M, and (c) is sparing
as to WT. In some embodiments, an at least one activating mutation is a deletion mutation. In
some embodiments, an at least one activating mutation is a point mutation.                In some

                                               - 36
embodiments, an activating mutation is delE746-A750. In some embodiments, an activating
mutation is L858R. In some embodiments, an activating mutation is G719S.
[00178]     Accordingly, another embodiment of the present invention relates to treating or
lessening the severity of one or more diseases in which at least one mutant of EGFR is known to
play a role. Specifically, the present invention relates to a method of treating or lessening the
severity of a disease or condition selected from a proliferative disorder, wherein said method
comprises administering to a patient in need thereof a compound or composition according to the
present invention.
[00179]     In some embodiments, the present invention provides a method for treating or
lessening the severity of one or more disorders selected from a cancer. In some embodiments,
the cancer is associated with a solid tumor. In certain embodiments, the cancer is breast cancer,
glioblastoma, lung cancer, cancer of the head and neck, colorectal cancer, bladder cancer, or
non-small cell lung cancer. In some embodiments, the present invention provides a method for
treating or lessening the severity of one or more disorders selected from squamous cell
carcinoma, salivary gland carcinoma, ovarian carcinoma, or pancreatic cancer.
[00180]     In certain embodiments, the present invention provides a method for treating or
lessening the severity of neurofibromatosis type I (NF1), neurofibromatosis type II (NF2)
Schwann cell neoplasms (e.g. MPNST's), or Schwannomas.
[00181]     Compound 2 and compositions thereof, according to the method of the present
invention, may be administered using any amount and any route of administration effective for
treating or lessening the severity of a cancer. The exact amount required will vary from subject
to subject, depending on the species, age, and general condition of the subject, the severity of the
infection, the particular agent, its mode of administration, and the like.          Compound 2 is
preferably formulated in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage.
The expression "dosage unit form" as used herein refers to a physically discrete unit of agent
appropriate for the patient to be treated. It will be understood, however, that the total daily usage
of the compounds and compositions of the present invention will be decided by the attending
physician within the scope of sound medical judgment. The specific effective dose level for any
particular patient or organism will depend upon a variety of factors including the disorder being
treated and the severity of the disorder; the activity of the specific compound employed; the

                                             - 37
specific composition employed; the age, body weight, general health, sex and diet of the patient;
the time of administration, route of administration, and rate of excretion of the specific
compound employed; the duration of the treatment; drugs used in combination or coincidental
with the specific compound employed, and like factors well known in the medical arts. The term
"patient", as used herein, means an animal, preferably a mammal, and most preferably a human.
[00182]      Pharmaceutically acceptable compositions of this invention can be administered to
humans and other animals orally, rectally, parenterally, intracisternally, intravaginally,
intraperitoneally, topically (as by powders, ointments, or drops), bucally, as an oral or nasal
spray, or the like, depending on the severity of the infection being treated.          In certain
embodiments, Compound 2 may be administered orally or parenterally at dosage levels of about
0.01 mg/kg to about 60 mg/kg, or about 0.1 mg/kg to about 50 mg/kg, or about 0.25 mg/kg to
about 45 mg/kg and preferably from about 0.5 mg/kg to about 25 mg/kg, of subject body weight
per day, one or more times a day, to obtain the desired therapeutic effect.
[00183]      Liquid dosage forms for oral administration include, but are not limited to,
pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, microemulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups and
elixirs.   In addition to Compound 2, the liquid dosage forms may contain inert diluents
commonly used in the art such as, for example, water or other solvents, solubilizing agents and
emulsifiers such as ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, ethyl carbonate, ethyl acetate, benzyl
alcohol, benzyl benzoate, polyethylene glycol (e.g., PEG 200, PEG 400, PEG 1000, PEG 2000),
propylene glycol, 1,3-butylene glycol, dimethylformamide, oils (in particular, cottonseed,
groundnut, corn, germ, olive, castor, and sesame oils), glycerol, tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol,
Vitamin E polyethylene glycol succinate (d-alpha tocopheryl polyethylene glycol 1000
succinate), polyethylene glycols and fatty acid esters of sorbitan, and mixtures thereof. Besides
inert diluents, the oral compositions can also include adjuvants such as wetting agents,
emulsifying and suspending agents, sweetening, flavoring, and perfuming agents.        The liquid
forms above can also be filled into a soft or hard capsule to form a solid dosage form. Suitable
capsules can be formed from, for example, gelatin, starch and cellulose derivatives (e.g.,
hydroxycellulose, hydropropylmethylcellulose).
[00184]      Injectable preparations, for example, sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous
suspensions may be formulated according to the known art using suitable dispersing or wetting

                                               - 38
agents and suspending agents. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable
solution, suspension or emulsion in a nontoxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, for
example, as a solution in 1,3-butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may
be employed are water, Ringer's solution, U.S.P. and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In
addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For
this purpose any bland fixed oil can be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In
addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid are used in the preparation of injectables.
[00185]     Injectable formulations can be sterilized, for example, by filtration through a
bacterial-retaining filter, or by incorporating sterilizing agents in the form of sterile solid
compositions which can be dissolved or dispersed in sterile water or other sterile injectable
medium prior to use.
[00186]     In order to prolong the effect of Compound 2 of the present invention, it is often
desirable to slow the absorption of the compound from subcutaneous or intramuscular injection.
This may be accomplished by the use of a liquid suspension of crystalline or amorphous material
with poor water solubility. The rate of absorption of the compound then depends upon its rate of
dissolution that, in turn, may depend upon crystal size and crystalline form.           Alternatively,
delayed absorption of a parenterally administered compound form is accomplished by dissolving
or suspending the compound in an oil vehicle. Injectable depot forms are made by forming
microencapsule matrices of the compound in biodegradable polymers such as polylactide
polyglycolide.     Depending upon the ratio of compound to polymer and the nature of the
particular polymer employed, the rate of compound release can be controlled. Examples of other
biodegradable polymers include poly(orthoesters) and poly(anhydrides).               Depot injectable
formulations are also prepared by entrapping the compound in liposomes or microemulsions that
are compatible with body tissues.
[00187]     Compositions for rectal or vaginal administration are preferably suppositories which
can be prepared by mixing Compound 2 of this invention with suitable non-irritating excipients
or carriers such as cocoa butter, polyethylene glycol or a suppository wax which are solid at
ambient temperature but liquid at body temperature and therefore melt in the rectum or vaginal
cavity and release the active compound.

[00188]     Solid dosage forms for oral administration include capsules, tablets, pills, powders,
and granules.     In such solid dosage forms, Compound 2 is mixed with at least one inert,
pharmaceutically acceptable excipient or carrier such as sodium citrate, Avicel, hydroxypropyl
cellulose or dicalcium phosphate and/or a) fillers or extenders such as starches, lactose, sucrose,
glucose, mannitol, and silicic acid, b) binders such as, for example, carboxymethylcellulose,
alginates, gelatin, polyvinylpyrrolidinone, sucrose, PVP vinyl acetate, and acacia, c) humectants
such as glycerol, d) disintegrating agents such as agar--agar, calcium carbonate, potato or tapioca
starch, alginic acid, certain silicates, sodium croscarmellose and sodium carbonate, e) solution
retarding agents such as paraffin, f) absorption accelerators such as quaternary ammonium
compounds, g) wetting agents such as, for example, cetyl alcohol and glycerol monostearate, h)
absorbents such as kaolin and bentonite clay, i) lubricants such as talc, calcium stearate,
magnesium stearate, solid polyethylene glycols, sodium lauryl sulfate, j) solubilising agents such
as Vitamin E polyethylene glycol succinate (d-alpha tocopheryl polyethylene glycol 1000
succinate), steric acid, and mixtures thereof. In the case of capsules, tablets and pills, the dosage
form may also comprise buffering agents.
[00189]     Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in soft and hard
filled capsules using such excipients as lactose or milk sugar as well as high molecular weight
polyethylene glycols and the like. The solid dosage forms of tablets, dragees, capsules, pills, and
granules can be prepared with coatings and shells such as enteric coatings and other coatings
well known in the pharmaceutical formulating art. They may optionally contain opacifying
agents and can also be of a composition that they release the active ingredient(s) only, or
preferentially, in a certain part of the intestinal tract, optionally, in a delayed manner. Examples
of embedding compositions that can be used include polymeric substances and waxes. Solid
compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in soft and hard-filled capsules
using such excipients as lactose or milk sugar as well as high molecular weight polyethylene
glycols and the like.
[00190]     Compound 2 can also be in micro-encapsulated form with one or more excipients as
noted above. The solid dosage forms of tablets, dragees, capsules, pills, and granules can be
prepared with coatings and shells such as cosmetic coatings, enteric coatings, release controlling
coatings and other coatings well known in the pharmaceutical formulating art. In such solid

                                              - 40
dosage forms the active compound may be admixed with at least one inert diluent such as a
polymer, sucrose, lactose or starch. Such dosage forms may also comprise, as is normal practice,
additional substances other than inert diluents, e.g., tableting lubricants and other tableting aids
such a magnesium stearate and microcrystalline cellulose. In the case of capsules, tablets and
pills, the dosage forms may also comprise buffering agents.          They may optionally contain
opacifying agents and can also be of a composition that they release the active ingredient(s) only,
or preferentially, in a certain part of the intestinal tract, optionally, in a delayed manner.
Examples of embedding compositions that can be used include polymeric substances and waxes.
[00191]     Dosage forms for topical or transdermal administration of Compound 2 include
ointments, pastes, creams, lotions, gels, powders, solutions, sprays, inhalants or patches. The
active component is admixed under sterile conditions with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier
and any needed preservatives or buffers as may be required. Ophthalmic formulation, ear drops,
and eye drops are also contemplated as being within the scope of this invention. Additionally,
the present invention contemplates the use of transdermal patches, which have the added
advantage of providing controlled delivery of a compound to the body. Such dosage forms can
be made by dissolving or dispensing the compound in the proper medium. Absorption enhancers
can also be used to increase the flux of the compound across the skin. The rate can be controlled
by either providing a rate controlling membrane or by dispersing the compound in a polymer
matrix or gel.

[00204]      In certain embodiments, Compound 2 or a pharmaceutically                  acceptable
composition thereof is administered in combination with a monoclonal antibody or an siRNA
therapeutic.
[00205]      The additional agents may be administered separately from a Compound 2
containing composition, as part of a multiple dosage regimen. Alternatively, those agents

                                             -  45
may be part of a single dosage form, mixed together with Compound 2 in a single
composition. If administered as part of a multiple dosage regime, the two active agents may
be submitted simultaneously, sequentially or within a period of time from one another (e.g.,
one hour, two hours, six hours, twelve hours, one day, one week, two weeks, one month).
[00206]     As used herein, the terms "combination," "combined," and related terms refer to
the simultaneous or sequential administration of therapeutic agents in accordance with this
invention. For example, Compound 2 may be administered with another therapeutic agent
simultaneously or sequentially in separate unit dosage forms or together in a single unit
dosage form.      Accordingly, the present invention provides a single unit dosage form
comprising Compound 2, an additional therapeutic agent, and a pharmaceutically acceptable
carrier, adjuvant, or vehicle.
[00207]     The amount of Compound 2 and additional therapeutic agent (in those
compositions which comprise an additional therapeutic agent as described above) that may be
combined with the carrier materials to produce a single dosage form will vary depending
upon the host treated and the particular mode of administration. Preferably, compositions of
this invention should be formulated so that a dosage of between 0.01 - 100 mg/kg body
weight/day of Compound 2 can be administered.
[00208]     In those compositions that include an additional therapeutic agent, that additional
therapeutic agent and Compound 2 may act synergistically.          Therefore, the amount of
additional therapeutic agent in such compositions may be less than that required in a
monotherapy utilizing only that therapeutic agent.       In such compositions, a dosage of
between 0.01 - 1,000 [tg/kg body weight/day of the additional therapeutic agent can be
administered.
[00209]     The amount of additional therapeutic agent present in the compositions of this
invention will be no more than the amount that would normally be administered in a
composition comprising that therapeutic agent as the only active agent.         Preferably the
amount of additional therapeutic agent in the presently disclosed compositions will range
from about 50% to 100% of the amount normally present in a composition comprising that
agent as the only therapeutically active agent.

                                              - 46
[00210]     Compound 2 or pharmaceutical compositions thereof may also be incorporated
into compositions for coating an implantable medical device, such as prostheses, artificial
valves, vascular grafts, stents and catheters. Vascular stents, for example, have been used to
overcome restenosis (re-narrowing of the vessel wall after injury). However, patients using
stents or other implantable devices risk clot formation or platelet activation. These unwanted
effects may be prevented or mitigated by pre-coating the device with a pharmaceutically
acceptable composition comprising a kinase inhibitor.        Implantable devices coated with
Compound 2 are another embodiment of the present invention.
[00211]     All features of each of the aspects of the invention apply to all other aspects mutatis
mutandis.
[00212]     In order that the invention described herein may be more fully understood, the
following examples are set forth. It should be understood that these examples are for illustrative
purposes only and are not to be construed as limiting this invention in any manner.

Step 1:
[00215]     In a 25 mL 3-neck round-bottom flask previously equipped with a magnetic stirrer,
Thermo pocket and CaCl 2 guard tube, N-Boc-1,3-diaminobenzene (0.96 g) and n-butanol
(9.00 mL) were charged.         The reaction mixture was cooled to 0 C.          2,4-Dichloro-5
trifluoromethylpyrimidine (1.0 g) was added dropwise to the above reaction mixture at 0 C.
Diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA) (0.96 mL) was dropwise added to the above reaction
mixture at 0 C and the reaction mixture was stirred for 1 hr at 0 C to 5 C. Finally, the
reaction mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature. The reaction mixture was stirred
for another 4 hrs at room temperature. Completion of reaction was monitored by TLC using
hexane: ethyl acetate (7: 3). The solid precipitated out was filtered off and washed with 1
butanol (2 mL). The solid was dried under reduced pressure at 40 C for 1 hr.               1H-NMR
(DMSO-d6, 400 MHz) 6 1.48 (S, 9 H), 7.02 (m, 1 H), 7.26 (m, 2 H), 7.58 (S, 1 H), 8.57 (S, 1
H), 9.48 (S, 1 H), 9.55 (S, 1 H).
Step 2:
[00216]     To the above crude (3.1 g) in dichloromethane (DCM) (25 mL) was added
trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) (12.4 mL) slowly at 0 C. The reaction mixture was allowed to
warm to room temperature. The reaction mixture was stirred for another 10 min at room
temperature. The crude was concentrated under reduced pressure.
Step 3:
[00217]     The concentrated crude was dissolved in DIPEA (2.0 mL) and dichloromethane
(25 mL), and then cooled to -30 'C. To the reaction mixture was slowly added acryloyl
chloride (0.76 g) at -30 'C. The reaction mass was warmed to room temperature stirred at
room temperature for 1.0 hr. The reaction was monitored on TLC using hexane: ethyl acetate
(7:3) as mobile phase. The reaction was completed after 1 hr. Step 3 yielded intermediate 1.

                                              - 48
Step 4:
[00218]     To obtain a salt of compound 1, a mixture of intermediate 1 (16 mg) and 2
methoxy-4-(4-acetylpiperazinyl)aniline in dioxane (1.0 mL) with catalytic trifluoroacetic acid
was stirred overnight at 50 C. The crude was concentrated under reduced pressure and
purified using HPLC (TFA modifier) to give compound 1 as a TFA salt. IH-NMR (DMSO
d6, 400 MHz) 6 10.2 (S, 1 H), 8.2 (br, 1 H), 8.30 (S, 1 H), 7.73 (br, 1 H), 7.52 (d, J = 7.8 Hz,

J = 11.4, 16.9 Hz, 1 H), 6.24 (d, J = 16.9 Hz, 1 H), 5.75 (d, J = 11.4 Hz, 1 H), 3.76 (S, 3 H),
3.04 (br, 4 H), 2.04 (S, 3 H); calculated mass for C 2 7 H2 8 F3 N 7 0 3 : 555.2, found: 556.2 (M+H+).
Step 5:
[00219]     To obtain the free base form of Compound 1 from the TFA salt, the salt was
added to DCM and cooled to 00 C. Na2 CO 3 solution (9.6% w/w) was added at 00 C. The
mixture was warmed to 20'C and stirred for 35 min. The pH of the aqueous layer was > 8.
The layers were separated. Extraction of the aqueous layer was performed using DCM. The
organic layers were combined and washed with brine. The organic layer was collected and
evaporated to yield a solid of Compound 1.
General Preparation of Compound 2
[00220]     For each counterion and solvent system, ca. 25 or 50 mg of the free base of
Compound 1 was slurried in 200-300 pl of the allocated solvent. The solvents included
acetone, dichloromethane, cyclohexane, ethyl acetate, methanol (methyl ethyl ketone for
sulfonic acid-containing counterions), methyl isobutyl ketone, 2-propanol (isopropyl acetate
for sulfonic acid-containing counterions), tetrahydrofuran and acetonitrile:water (90:10). The
respective counterion was also dissolved / slurried in 200-300 pl of the allocated solvent.
The counterions included benzenesulfonic acid, camphor sulfonic acid, 1,2-ethane disulfonic
acid, hydrobromic acid, hydrochloric acid, maleic acid, methanesulfonic acid, naphthalene-2
sulfonic acid, 1,5-naphthalene disulfonic acid, oxalic acid, 4-toluenesulfonic acid and 2,4,6
trihydroxybenzoic acid.      One equivalent of each counterion was used and additional
experiments with two equivalents of benzenesulfonic acid, hydrochloric acid, sulphuric acid
and p-toluenesulfonic acid were performed. The acid solution / slurry was then added to the

                                                - 49
slurry of Compound 1 in small aliquots in order to minimize the risk of degradation. The pH
of the reaction was then checked using universal indicator paper.
[00221]      The mixtures of Compound 1/counterion/solvent created using the procedure
above were temperature cycled between ca. OC and ambient (ca. 22'C) whilst stirring in 1
hour cycles for a period of 1-2 days. Overnight, samples were kept at ca. 2-5'C. The
mixtures were visually checked for any obvious signs of degradation (i.e. color changes) and
then, if not visually degraded, any solids present were isolated and allowed to dry at ambient
conditions prior to analysis. The solids represent isolated Compound 2.
General Procedures
[00222]      The solubility of the potential salts was tested using a shake flask method whereby
a slurry of each salt was prepared in deionized water and the pH of the reaction was reduced
to below pH 2 by adding a small amount of the counterion used for salt formation. The pH
was tested using universal indicator paper. After ca. 24 hours of shaking, the slurries were
filtered for the solubility determination using HPLC analysis.
[00223]      X-Ray Powder Diffraction.         X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) analysis was
carried out on a Siemens D5000, scanning the samples between 3 and 30, 35 or 50 020. For
samples <100 mg, ca. 5-10 mg of sample was gently compressed onto a glass slide which
fitted into the sample holder. For samples >100 mg, ca. 100 mg of sample was gently
compressed into a plastic sample holder, so that the sample surface was smooth and just
above the level of the sample holder.           Measurements were made using the following
experimental conditions :
start position           3.00 020
end position             30, 35 or 50 020

[00224]     Polarized Light Microscopy.      In polarized light microscopy (PLM), the presence
of crystallinity    (birefringence) was   determined using an Olympus BX50 polarising
microscope, equipped with a Motic camera and image capture software (Motic Images Plus
2.0). All images were recorded using the 20x objective, unless otherwise stated.
[00225]      Thermogravimetric      Analysis.       For  thermogravimetric    analysis   (TGA),
approximately 5-10 mg of material was accurately weighed into an open aluminium pan and
loaded into a simultaneous thermogravimetric/differential thermal analyser (TG/DTA) and
held at room temperature. The sample was then heated at a rate of 100 C/min from 25 0 C to
300 0 C during which time the change in sample weight was recorded along with any
differential thermal events (DTA). Nitrogen was used as the purge gas, at a flow rate of 100
cm 3/min.
[00226]     Differential Scanning Calorimetry. For differential scanning calorimetry (DSC),
approximately 5-10 mg of material was weighed into an aluminium DSC pan and sealed non
hermetically with a pierced aluminium lid. The sample pan was then loaded into a Seiko
DSC6200 (equipped with a cooler) cooled and held at 25 0 C.            Once a stable heat-flow
response was obtained, the sample and reference were heated to ca. 260 OC-280         0C  at scan
rate of 10 C/min and the resulting heat flow response monitored.
[00227]     Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy.               IH-NMR    experiments were
performed on a Bruker AV400 (IH frequency: 400 MHz). IH experiments of each sample

                                              -51
were performed in deuterated DMSO and each sample was prepared to ca. 1mg/mL
concentration.
[00228]     Dynamic Vapour Sorption. For dynamic vapour sorption (DVS), approximately
10-20 mg of sample was placed into a wire mesh vapour sorption balance pan and loaded into
a DVS-1 dynamic vapour sorption balance by Surface Measurement Systems. The sample
was subjected to a ramping profile from 20 - 90 % relative humidity (RH) at 10 %
increments, maintaining the sample at each step until a stable weight had been achieved (99.5
% step completion). After completion of the sorption cycle, the sample was dried using the
same procedure, but all the way down to 0 % RH and finally taken back to the starting point
of 20 % RH. The weight change during the sorption/desorption cycles were plotted, allowing
for the hygroscopic nature of the sample to be determined.
[00229]     Infrared Spectroscopy.    Infrared spectroscopy (IR) was carried out on a Bruker
ALPHA P spectrometer.      Sufficient material was placed onto the centre of the plate of the
spectrometer and the spectra were obtained using the following parameters:
resolution                     4 cm-I
background scan time           16 scans
sample scan time               16 scans

[00230]     For Karl Fischer (KF) Coulometric titration, 10-15 mg of solid material was
accurately weighed into a vial. The solid was then manually introduced into the titration cell
of a Mettler Toledo C30 Compact Titrator. The vial was back-weighed after the addition of
the solid and the weight of the added solid entered on the instrument. Titration was initiated
once the sample had fully dissolved in the cell.          The water content was calculated
automatically by the instrument as a percentage and the data printed.
[00231]     Reverse-phase gradient high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was
performed on an Agilent 1100 instrument fitted with a C18, 3.0 x 100 mm x 3.5 pm column.
The detection wavelength was 240 nm.

[00232]      A Sotax AT7 dissolution bath (USP 2, EP 2 apparatus) was used for the
dissolution study in which paddles were used to stir the media. All tests were carried out at
37'C and a paddle speed of 100 rpm.

[00234]       For the potential salts obtained during the primary salt screen in Example 1, the
samples were set-up for 1 week stability studies at 40'C/75% RH (open vials) and 80'C (open
vials). TGA was carried out after the stability studies for samples containing sufficient material.
The solubility of the samples was also tested in an aqueous medium (pH < 2). The results for the
stability and solubility studies are indicated in Table 2.

[00235]       From these results the bis-besylate salt was selected to be scaled up, using acetone
as the solvent.      In addition, the hydrobromide salt was selected to be scaled up, using
acetonitrile:water (90:10) as the solvent. The mono-maleate and bis-hydrochloride salts were
also selected for scale-up experiments to assess whether these are solvated/hydrated.

                             Secondary Screen of Bis-Besylate Salt
[00236]      Approximately 5 mL of acetone was added to approximately 800 mg of Compound 1
to form a slurry. In a separate vial, approximately 3 mL acetone was added to 2 equivalents of
benzenesulfonic acid to dissolve the acid. The acid solution was then added in small aliquots to
the free base slurry while stirring.     After the complete addition of the acid, a gum/oil-like
material initially formed, however, this converted to a solid after ca. 30 minutes of stirring. The
reaction was stirred for ca. 1.5 days before being isolated and dried. The material was initially
dried at ambient under vacuum (ca. 22'C) for 3 days, however, approximately 6.7% acetone was
still present at this stage. A portion was then dried for a further 2 days at 40'C under vacuum
after which ca. 2.7% acetone remained. The material was then dried for a further 2 days at 60'C
under vacuum. The yield was 1.1 g of material (86%).
[00237]      To examine whether the citric acid in the buffers was having an effect on the
solubility values obtained for pH 3, 4.5 and 6.6, the thermodynamic solubility experiments were
repeated at these pH values using KHP/HCl for pH 3, KHP/ NaOH for pH 4.5 and
phosphate/NaOH for pH 6.6. The remaining solids were also analysed by XRPD analysis to
establish if any changes in the solid form occurred.
[00238]      XRPD analysis (Figure 1) showed the material to be crystalline. The diffractogram is
consistent with the small scale bis-besylate Form I diffractograms obtained during the primary
salt screen.
[00239]      TGA/DTA was carried after 3 days of drying at ambient under vacuum as well as
after further drying for 2 days at 40 'C under vacuum and 2 days at 60 'C under vacuum. After
the ambient drying process, the TGA showed a 6.7% weight loss between ca. 50-150 'C (Figure
2) (for an acetone solvate, 1 mole equivalent of acetone would be ca. 6.3 wt%). After further
drying, the TGA showed a 0.47% weight loss from the outset, likely due to unbound moisture or

                                              - 60
solvent. A further small 0.16% weight loss corresponded with the endotherm at onset ca. 142 'C
(Figure 3).
[00240]     DSC analysis (Figure 4) indicated a broad endotherm from the outset likely due to
unbound solvent. A second endotherm was present at onset ca. 139.4 'C (peak 146.1 C).
[00241]     Polarised Light Microscopy (not shown) showed birefringent particles with no clearly
defined morphology present.
[00242]     IR spectroscopy (Figure 5) showed a number of differences and shifts in comparison
with the freebase and benzenesulfonic acid.
            1H NMR spectroscopy (Figure 6) indicated that a number of the Compound 1 and
[00243]
benzenesulfonic     acid peaks    appear to be overlapping,       however, the     stoichiometry   is
approximately 2:1 benzenesulfonic acid: Compound 1. The acetone present does not appear to be
a stoichiometric amount.
[00244]     DVS analysis (Figure 7) showed a water uptake of ca. 2.2% between 20 and 70%
RH. The difference between the mass of the first sorption cycle and the desorption and second
sorption cycle at 20% RH is likely due to the loss of excess acetone in the first cycle.         The
material also appears to hydrate during DVS analysis as indicated by the change in polymorphic
form seen by post DVS XRPD analysis (not shown).            The XRPD diffractogram also showed
some loss in crystallinity.
[00245]     Karl Fischer Coulometry indicated a ca. 0.77% water content (Note: due to the
manual introduction of the solid material into the titration cell, measured values below 1% are
generally slightly higher than the actual water content).
[00246]     The HPLC purity evaluation (not shown) indicated a purity of ca. 97.6% for the bis
besylate salt with the main peak eluting at a retention time of ca. 13.05 minutes.
[00247]     Slurries of the bis-besylate salt were created in acetone: water mixtures (3%, 5%
and 10%) and stirred at ambient for ca. 4 days. The resulting solids were then analyzed by
XRPD to determine if any changes had occurred on slurrying. The hydration study results
from XRPD analysis (Figure 8) are summarised in Table 3.

[002481    The bis-besylate salt was slurried in deionized water at ambient temperature (ca.
22'C). A sample of solid was taken at 24 & 48 hours and analysed by XRPD. The pH of the
supernatant was also monitored. The Salt Disproportionation study results from XRPD analysis

[002501       Slurries of the bis-besylate salt were created in media of various pH (pH 1; pH 3;
pH 4.5 and pH 6.6) and shaken for ca. 24 hours. After 24 hours, the slurries were filtered and
the solution analysed by HPLC in order to determine the solubility at the various pH levels.
The remaining solids were also analysed by XRPD analysis to establish if any changes in the
solid form occurred. For the buffer solutions, KCl/HCl was used for pH 1 and
citrate/phosphate combinations for pH 3, 4.5 and 6.6.            Thermodynamic solubility studies

[00251]     When initially setting up the slurries for thermodynamic solubility determinations,
gums were obtained in all of the pH media used, however, upon shaking, the gums converted to
solids after ca. 2 hours.    The XRPD analysis of the excess solid from the slurries after the
solubility experiments, indicate that for pH 1, the bis-besylate salt hydrates while slurrying.
Hence, the solubility value obtained is likely an indication of the solubility of the hydrated
material. The diffractograms for the remaining samples appear different from the input material
as well as all identified forms of the bis-besylate and Compound 1 free base. The diffractograms
also appear different from the diffractograms of the solids used to make up the buffers. The
solubility values obtained using these pH buffers are likely not representative of the bis-besylate
salt which was initially placed into the solutions.
[00252]     Approximately 100 -120 mg of each form was compressed into discs by placing
the material into a die (diameter: 13 mm) and compressing the die under 5 tons of pressure in
a hydraulic press for ca. 2 minutes. A Sotax AT7 (conformed to EP2 and USP2) dissolution
instrument was used containing paddles to stir the media at 100 rpm. Dissolution media of pH
3 (1% SDS) and pH 4.5 (1% SDS) were prepared using citrate / phosphate buffer. All

                                               - 64
materials were tested in 750 ml of the buffer medium. Discs were added at time       = 0 seconds
and allowed to sink to the bottom of the dissolution vessel before stirring began. ca. 1 ml
aliquots of media were extracted from the dissolution vessels at times 1, 5, 10, 15, 30, 60,
120, 240 minutes and 24 hours, and tested for dissolved salt concentration by HPLC-UV.
The dissolution tests were carried out in duplicate. For both dissolution media, the peak areas
for the initial time points (up to 15 minutes), fell below the limit of quantification, however,
when plotting Dissolution rate vs. time, the steepest part of the curve occurs during these
early time points.
[00253]      For pH 4.5, when plotting the curve of Dissolution rate vs. Time (Figure 12), the
intrinsic dissolution values obtained from the early time points on the curve (steepest part of
the curve) were approximately 0.61 mg/cm 2/min for both tablets 1 and 2. At the later time
points, intrinsic dissolution values of 0.09 mg/cm 2/min and 0.08 mg/cm 2 /min were obtained
for tablets 1 and 2, respectively.
[00254]      For pH 3.0, when plotting the curve of Dissolution rate vs. Time (Figure 13), the
intrinsic dissolution values obtained from the early time points on the curve (steepest part of the
curve) were approximately 0.36 mg/cm 2 /min for tablet 1 and 0.38 mg/cm 2 /min for tablet 2. At
the later time points, intrinsic dissolution values of 0.08 mg/cm 2 /min and 0.07 mg/cm 2 /min were
obtained for tablets 1 and 2, respectively.

[00255]      Approximately 3 mL of acetone was added to ca. 500 mg of Compound 1 to form
a slurry.     In a separate vial, ca. 1 mL of acetone was added to 2 equivalents of
benzenesulfonic acid in order to dissolve the acid. The acid solution was then added in small
aliquots to the freebase slurry while stirring. The reaction was stirred for ca. 1 day while
temperature cycling between 0 and ambient temperature (ca. 22 C). After 1 day, deionized
water was added to the reaction mixture and the slurry was allowed to stir for ca. 3 hours
before being isolated and dried at ambient under vacuum.

[00256]     XRPD analysis (Figure 14) showed the material to be crystalline. The diffractogram
is consistent with the bis-besylate hydrate obtained from the hydration studies of the bis-besylate
salt.
[00257]     TGA/DTA indicated a weight loss of ca. 2.1% between ca. 70 - 100 'C (Figure
15). This corresponds approximately with the 2.03 wt% water required for a monohydrate.
A ca. 2.2% weight loss was present from the outset to ca. 70 'C, likely due to unbound water.
Although the total ca. 4.2% weight loss corresponds approximately with a dihydrate, the first
weight loss occurs from the outset followed by a second clear weight loss corresponding with
mono amounts of water. As the first weight loss occurs from ca. 25 'C, this would likely be
due to unbound water.
[00258]     DSC analysis indicated a broad endotherm between ca. 40-115 'C. Two further
endotherms were then present at onset 119.7 'C (peak 134.3 'C) and onset 153.8 'C (peak
165.1 'C) (Figure 16).
[00259]     PLM analysis showed some birefringence, however the particle size is very small
and no clear morphology could be seen (not shown). Hot-stage microscopy was carried out
on a sample of the bis-besylate hydrate. No visual changes could be observed prior to the
material melting and degrading (turned brown) at ca. 160 'C.
[00260]     IR analysis (Figure 17) showed differences from both the free base and
benzenesulfonic acid spectra as well as some differences when comparing the spectra of the
input bis-besylate salt with that of the hydrated material.
[00261]     IH NMR spectroscopy (Figure 18) indicated that a number of the Compound 1
and benzenesulfonic acid peaks appear to be overlapping, however, the stoichiometry appears
to be approximately 2:1 benzenesulfonic acid: Compound 1. A small non-stoichiometric
amount of acetone was present in the spectrum.
[00262]     DVS analysis (Figure 19) showed a water uptake of ca. 1.3% between 20 and
70% RH. No hysteresis was seen between the sorption and desorption cycles. The XRPD
diffractogram of the material post DVS analysis was consistent with the diffractogram of the
input bis-besylate hydrate material (not shown).

                                              - 66
[00263]    The 1 week stability data at 40 'C/75% RH (open container) indicated that by
XRPD, the material remained consistent with the input material with no changes in
polymorphic form (Figure 20).
[00264]    HPLC purity determinations indicated an initial purity of ca. 98.4% and a purity
of ca. 98.3% after 1 week storage at 40 'C/75% RH.
[00265]    Thermodynamic solubility studies of the bis-besylate hydrate indicated the results
shown in Table 7.

[00266]    Intrinsic dissolution tests were carried out using pH 4.5 (1% SDS) and pH 3.0 (1%
SDS).    For both dissolution media, the peak areas for the initial time points (up to 15

                                              - 67
minutes), fell below the limit of quantification, however when plotting Dissolution rate vs.
time, the steepest part of the curve occurs during these early time points. For pH 4.5, when
plotting the curve of Dissolution rate vs. Time (Figure 22), the intrinsic dissolution values
obtained from the early time points on the curve (steepest part of the curve) were
approximately 0.43 mg/cm 2 /min for tablet 1 and 0.44 mg/cm 2 /min for tablet 2. At the later
time points (toward the end of the dissolution study), intrinsic dissolution values of 0.012
mg/cm 2 /min and 0.006 mg/cm 2 /min were obtained for tablets 1 and 2, respectively.
[00267]     For pH 3.0, when plotting the curve of Dissolution rate vs. Time (Figure 23), the
intrinsic dissolution values obtained from the early time points on the curve (steepest part of
the curve) were approximately 0.38 mg/cm 2 /min for tablet 1 and 0.39 mg/cm 2/min for tablet
2. At the later time points, intrinsic dissolution values of 0.01 mg/cm 2 /min for both tablets 1
and 2 were obtained.
[00268]     A larger batch of the bis-besylate hydrate salt was prepared using the following
procedure. Approximately 20 mL of acetone was added to ca. 14 g of Compound 1 in a
round bottomed flask to form a slurry. In a separate flask, ca. 10 mL of acetone was added to
2 equivalents of benzenesulfonic acid in order to dissolve the acid. The acid solution was
then added in small aliquots to the freebase slurry whilst stirring at ca. 0 'C. The resulting
slurry was then allowed to stir at ambient for ca. 2 hours. It was then placed at ca. 5 'C for 2
days before stirring for a further 3 hours at ambient temperature.       The acetone was then
removed and ca. 20 mL of water was added to the material. The slurry was temperature
cycled (0 'C - ambient temperature (ca. 22 C)) in 2 hour cycles for ca. 1 day. The solid was
then isolated by filtration and allowed to dry at ambient conditions under vacuum before
analysis. The drying was continued for ca. 10 days.
[00269]     The properties of the material from this larger batch were similar to those
described above. In addition to those properties, it was noted that when the bis-besylate
hydrate was left on the bench for 2 hours and TGA was again carried out, the sample seemed
to pick up the water to have a total ca. 4.5% weight loss in the final TGA. It does not appear
to be possible to remove the remaining 2% of unbound water by drying as this is regained
when exposed to ambient conditions. Also, KF titration determined the water content of the
material to be ca. 3.97%. While the ca. 4 wt% water would correspond theoretically with a

                                              - 68
dihydrate, the weight loss in the TGA appears to start from the outset followed by a more
clear second weight loss which corresponds approximately with 1 equivalent of water. The
material likely shows some hygroscopicity resulting in the initial TGA weight loss.
                                           Example 5
                           Secondary Screen of Mono-maleate Salt
[00270]     Approximately 3 mL of dichloromethane was added to ca. 200 mg of Compound
1 to form a slurry. In a separate vial, ca. 1 mL of dichloromethane was added to 1 equivalent
of maleic acid in order to dissolve the acid. The acid solution was then added in small
aliquots to the freebase slurry while stirring. The slurry obtained was yellow in color. The
reaction was stirred for ca. 1.5 days between 0 'C and ambient temperature (ca. 22 'C) and
remained at ca. 4 'C for a further 2 days before being isolated and dried at ambient. The
material was dried at ambient temperature under vacuum (ca. 22 'C) for ca. 2 days.
[00271]     XRPD analysis (Figure 24) showed the material to be crystalline.             The
diffractogram is consistent with the small scale mono-maleate Form I diffractogram obtained
during the primary salt screen.
[00272]     TGA/DTA was carried after 2 days of drying at ambient under vacuum. The TGA
showed a 0.4% weight loss from the outset, likely due to unbound moisture or solvent. A
large 10.9% weight loss is associated with endothermic/exothermic events in the DTA
between ca. 145-185 'C, followed by further weight losses due to likely degradation (Figure
25).
[00273]     DSC analysis indicated an endotherm at onset 160.4 'C (peak 163.8 'C), directly
followed by an exotherm, likely due to recrystallisation and then final degradation (Figure
26).
[00274]     1H NMR spectroscopy (Figure 27) indicated approximately 1:1 stoichiometry of
Compound 1: maleic acid. Dichloromethane was not present in the spectrum. Therefore, the
mono-maleate salt does not appear to be solvated.

[00275]      Approximately 1.5 mL of acetonitrile:H 20 (90:10) was added to ca. 200 mg of
Compound 1 to form a slurry. In a separate vial, ca. 1 mL of acetonitrile:H 20 (90:10) was
added to 2 equivalents of hydrochloric acid.      The acid solution was then added in small
aliquots to the freebase slurry while stirring.    The reaction was stirred for ca. 1.5 days
between 00 C and ambient temperature (ca. 22 'C) and remained at ca. 4 'C for a further 2
days before being isolated and dried at ambient temperature.        The material was dried at
ambient temperature under vacuum (ca. 22 'C) for ca. 2 days.
[00276]      XRPD analysis (Figure 28) showed the material to be crystalline.            The
diffractogram is consistent with the small scale bis-hydrochloride Form I diffractogram
obtained during the primary salt screen.
[00277]      TGA/DTA was carried after 2 days of drying at ambient under vacuum. The TGA
showed a 2.7% gradual weight loss from the outset to ca. 180 'C. A further 4.3% weight loss
is seen between ca. 180-210 'C, which corresponds with an endotherm in the DTA trace
(Figure 29).
[00278]      DSC analysis indicated a broad endotherm between ca. 30-160 'C. A further
endotherm is then present at onset 206.4'C (peak 226.5'C), directly followed by a smaller
endotherm at peak 238.2'C (Figure 30).
[00279]      Karl Fischer analysis showed ca. 3.3% water content (ca. 2.8% water required for
a monohydrate).
[00280]      1H NMR spectroscopy (Figure 31) indicated that the spectrum had shifted in
comparison with Compound 1, indicating likely salt formation. No signs of degradation
could be seen. The free base peak appears to be partially overlapping with the region for
acetonitrile, however, no significant amounts of acetonitrile appear to be present.

                   Secondary Screening of Hydrobromide Salt (1 equiv.)
[00281]     Approximately ca. 5 mL of acetonitrile: water (10%) was added to ca. 1 g of
Compound 1 free base to form a slurry.     In a separate vial, ca. 3 mL of acetonitrile : water
(10%) was added to 1 equivalent of hydrobromic acid (48%). The acid solution was then
added dropwise over a 1 hour period to the free base slurry whilst stirring and maintaining a
temperature between 0-5 'C.      After the complete addition of the acid, a further 3 mL of
acetonitrile : water (10%) was added.    The reaction was stirred for ca. 1 day before being
isolated and dried under vacuum at ambient (ca. 22 C). A yield of ca. 79% was obtained.
[00282]     XRPD analysis (Figure 32) was carried out on the wet sample and after drying.
The analysis indicated that the material undergoes a form change upon drying. The
diffractogram of the scaled up material, both before and after drying, was different from the
diffractogram of the primary screen hydrobromide sample.
[00283]     TGA/DTA showed a 1.01% weight loss from the outset, likely due to unbound
moisture or solvent. No further weight losses were seen prior to degradation at onset ca.
230'C (Figure 33).
[00284]     DSC analysis (Figure 34) indicated a broad endotherm from the outset likely due
to unbound solvent/water. A second endotherm was then seen at onset ca. 230 'C (peak 238
 C), followed by likely degradation.
[00285]     Polarised Light Microscopy showed very small particles with no clearly defined
morphology present (not shown).
[00286]     IR spectroscopy (Figure 35) showed a number of differences and shifts in
comparison with the freebase.
[00287]     1H  NMR spectroscopy (Figure 36) indicated a number of peak shifts in
comparison with the freebase.
[00288]     DVS analysis (Figure 37) showed a water uptake of 0.97% between 20 and 70%
RH. The water uptake between 0-90% RH is reversible showing very little hysteresis. Post
DVS XRPD analysis indicated that the polymorphic form appears to remain consistent after
exposure to varying RH % conditions (not shown).
[00289]     Karl Fischer Coulometry indicated a ca. 1.65% water content.

[00290]      The HPLC purity evaluation indicated a purity of ca. 97.5% for the hydrobromide
salt with the main peak eluting at a retention time of ca. 13 minutes.
[00291]      Slurries of the hydrobromide salt were created in acetone: water mixtures (3%,
5% and 10%) and stirred at ambient for ca. 3 days. The resulting solids were then analysed
by XRPD to determine if any changes had occurred on slurrying. The hydration study results
from XRPD analysis (Figure 38) are summarised in Table 8.

[00292]      The hydrobromide salt was slurried in deionised water at ambient temperature (ca.
22'C). A sample of solid was taken at 1, 24 & 48 hours and analysed by XRPD. The pH of
the supernatant was also monitored. The Salt Disproportionation study results from XRPD
analysis (Figure 39) are summarised in Table 9.

[00293]      The hydrobromide salt was exposed to environments of 40 'C/75%RH (open and
closed vial) and 80 'C (open vial) for 1 week to determine stability. Resulting solids were
analysed by XRPD and HPLC to establish if any changes had occurred. The 1 Week stability

[00294]      Slurries of the hydrobromide salt were created in media of various pH (pH 1; pH
3; pH 4.5 and pH 6.2) and shaken for ca. 24 hours. After 24 hours, the slurries were filtered
and the solution analyzed by HPLC in order to determine the solubility at the various pH
levels.    The remaining solids were also analysed by XRPD analysis to establish if any
changes in the solid form occurred. For the buffer solutions, KCl/HCl was used for pH 1 and
citric acid / sodium citrate combinations for pH 3, 4.5 and 6.2. The thermodynamic solubility
studies indicated the results shown in Table 11.

                                 thermodynamic solubility experiments carried out on the
                                 bis-besylate salt.
                                 The diffractogram appears different from the input
           Citric                hydrobromide material, all known forms of the
    pH     acid/                 Compound 1 free base and the citric acid used in buffer
    6.2   Sodium       0.03      preparation. The diffractogram also appears to
          Citrate                correspond with the diffractograms obtained for the
                                 thermodynamic solubility experiments carried out on the
                                 bis-besylate salt.
[00295]     The diffractograms for the pH 3.0, 4.5 and 6.2 experiments appeared different
from the input material as well as all identified forms of the hydrobromide salt and
Compound 1 free base. The diffractograms also appeared different from the diffractograms of
the solids used to make up the buffers. The solubility values obtained using these pH buffers
are therefore likely not representative of the hydrobromide salt which was initially placed
into the solutions.
[00296]     Approximately 100 -120 mg of material was compressed into discs by placing the
material into a die (diameter: 13 mm) and compressing the die under 5 tons of pressure in a
hydraulic press for ca. 2 minutes. A Sotax AT7 (conformed to EP2 and USP2) dissolution
instrument was used containing paddles to stir the media at 100 rpm. Dissolution media of pH
3 (1% SDS) and pH 4.5 (1% SDS) were prepared using citrate / phosphate buffer. All
materials were tested in 750 ml of the buffer medium. Discs were added at time    = 0 seconds

                                              - 74
and allowed to sink to the bottom of the dissolution vessel before stirring began. ca. 1 ml
aliquots of media were extracted from the dissolution vessels at times 1, 5, 10, 15, 30, 60,
120, 240 minutes and 24 hours, and tested for API concentration by HPLC-UV.                The
dissolution tests were carried out in duplicate. For both dissolution media, the peak areas for
the initial time points (up to 15 minutes), fell below the limit of quantification, however,
when plotting Dissolution rate vs. time, the steepest part of the curve occurs during these
early time points.
[00297]     For pH 4.5, when plotting the curve of Dissolution rate vs. Time (Figure 42), the
intrinsic dissolution values obtained from the early time points on the curve (steepest part of
the curve) were approximately 0.27 mg/cm 2 /min for tablet 1 and 0.28 mg/cm 2/min for tablet
2.
[00298]     For pH 3.0, when plotting the curve of Dissolution rate vs. Time (Figure 43), the
intrinsic dissolution values obtained from the early time points on the curve (steepest part of
the curve) were approximately 0.35 mg/cm 2 /min for both tablets 1 and 2.

                    Secondary Screening of Hydrobromide Salt (2 equiv.)
[00299]     Approximately 1ml of methanol was added to ca. 200 mg of Compound 1 to form
a slurry. In a separate vial, ca. 1 mL of methanol was added to 2 equivalents of hydrobromic
acid (48%). The acid solution was then added dropwise over a 1 hour period to the free base
slurry whilst stirring and maintaining a temperature between 0-5 'C.       After the complete
addition of the acid, a further 1 mL of methanol was added. The reaction was stirred for ca. 3
hours before being isolated and dried. A yield of approximately 68% was obtained.
[00300]     XRPD analysis (Figure 44) was carried out after filtration and the diffractogram
obtained was consistent with the Form I material obtained using both 1 and 2 equivalents of
HBr in the primary salt screen.
[00301]     TGA/DTA (Figure 45) showed a 1.2% weight loss from the outset to ca. 100 0 C,
likely due to unbound moisture or solvent. No further weight losses were seen prior to

                                               - 75
degradation at onset ca. 230'C. The TGA/DTA is similar to the trace obtained for the 1
equivalent scaled-up form of Example 6.
[00302]     IR spectroscopy (Figure 46) showed a number of differences and shifts in
comparison with the free base and the hydrobromide (1 equiv.) scaled-up salt.
                                             Example 9
               Secondary Screening of Hydrobromide Salt (Unknown Form)
[00303]     The thermodynamic solubility experiments carried out on the hydrobromide salt
resulted in the formation of an unknown solid form. In attempts to characterize this form, as
well as establish the rate of conversion to this form while slurrying the material, the following
experiments were carried out.       Initially, approximately 100 mg of the hydrobromide (1
equiv.) material was slurried in a pH 6.2 aqueous solution at ambient and XRPD analysis was
carried out at time points 5 min., 1 hr, 2 hrs, 4 hrs and 8 hrs. Further analysis was then also
carried out on the converted material.
[00304]     The XRPD analysis (Figure 47) carried out on the hydrobromide (1 equiv.) salt
sample after slurrying the solid in an aqueous pH 6.2 medium for 5 min, 1 hr, 2 hrs, 4 hrs and
8 hrs indicated that conversion to the unknown solid form occurs between 2-4 hours.
[00305]     PLM analysis carried out on a slurry of the material indicated a very small particle
size. Some birefringence was observed (not shown). Upon drying the material became glass
like.
[00306]     1H  NMR analysis was carried out on this material which showed a spectrum
which was different in terms of peak positions from both the free base spectrum and the
hydrobromide spectrum (Figure 48).
[00307]     DSC analysis was also attempted on the glass-like material, however, a large
broad endotherm is seen from the outset to ca. 110 'C, followed by a pattern characteristic of
amorphous material (Figure 49).
[00308]     The slurry experiment of Compound 1 free base and the bis-besylate hydrate
(carried out in attempts to produce more of this form for analysis) were unsuccessful in
producing this unknown solid form. For the free base slurry, the material remained as the free

                                              - 76
base Form I and for the bis-besylate hydrate slurry, the material lost some crystallinity, but
remained as the bis-besylate hydrate (Figure 50).
[00309]     The further scale-up of the hydrobromide (1 equiv.) salt and subsequent slurrying
in a pH 6.2 aqueous medium resulted in this unknown solid form being obtained (Figure 51),
however, all attempts at filtering the material were unsuccessful with the solid going through
a sintered filter and multiple sheets of filter paper, due to the small particle size. Again,
attempts at evaporating off the solvent resulted in a glass-like material being obtained. This
appears to indicate that the unknown form is unstable when isolated.
                                           Example 10
                    Tertiary Screening of Hydrobromide Salt (1 equiv.)
[00310]     Approximately 85 mL of acetonitrile:water (90:10) was added to ca. 20 g of
Compound 1 in a round bottomed flask to form a slurry. In a separate flask, 1 equivalent of
hydrogen bromide (ca. 4.073 mL) was added to ca. 70 mL of acetonitrile:water (90:10). The
acid solution was then added in small aliquots to the free base slurry while stirring at ca. 4
'C. The resulting slurry was then allowed to stir at ambient temperature for ca. 2 hours. It
was then placed at ca. 5 'C for 1 day before stirring for a further 4 hours at ambient
temperature.    The reaction was then filtered and the solid dried under vacuum at ambient
temperature (ca. 22'C). The drying was continued for ca. 2 days.           Due to the partially
crystalline nature of the material after drying, the material was then slurried in ca. 50 mL of
an acetone:water (90:10) mixture. The reaction was temperature cycled between ca. 4-22 'C
in 1 hour cycles while stirring for ca. 2 days. The reaction was then filtered and dried at
ambient for ca. 4 days before being analyzed. The yield after the further slurrying was 16.4 g
(63%).
[00311]     XRPD analysis (Figure 52) carried out on the initial scale-up material while wet,
showed the sample to be highly crystalline. After drying, the solid converted to a different
polymorphic form and also lost some crystallinity.        XRPD analysis (Figure 53) on the
material after further slurrying in acetone:water( 10%) and subsequent drying indicated a
crystalline material. The diffractogram corresponded with the smaller scale hydrobromide
sample obtained after drying during Example 1.

                                             - 77
[00312]      IR Spectroscopy (Figure 54) showed differences when compared with the free
base spectrum. The spectrum also appeared consistent with the spectrum obtained for the
hydrobromide salt in Example 1.
[00313]      PLM (not shown) showed small particles with no defined morphology and little
birefringence.
[00314]      'H NMR (Figure 55) indicated a number of peak shifts in comparison with the
free base. A small non-stoichiometric amount of acetone was present in the spectrum.
[00315]      TGA/DTA (Figure 56) showed a weight loss from the outset of ca. 0.4%, likely
due to unbound moisture or solvent. No further significant weight losses were seen prior to
degradation at onset ca. 230 'C.
[00316]      DSC analysis (Figure 57) indicated a shallow, broad endotherm from the outset
likely due to unbound solvent/water. A second endotherm was then present at onset ca. 240
'C (peak 244 C), followed by likely degradation.
[00317]      KF analysis determined the water content of the material to be ca. 0.76%.
[00318]      HPLC purity determination indicated a purity of ca. 98.1 %.
[00319]      The content of carbon, hydrogen and nitrogen in the material was determined by
placing the samples into a tin capsule, placed inside an autosampler drum of an elemental
analysis system. The sample environment was purged by a continuous flow of helium and the
samples dropped at pre-set intervals into a vertical quartz tube maintained at 900 'C. The
mixture of combustion gases was separated and detected by a thermal conductivity detector
giving a signal proportional to the concentration of the individual components of the mixture.
The content of bromine in the material was determined by oxygen flask combustion of the
sample. Once the combustion and absorption into solution had occurred, the samples were
titrated using a calibrated Mercuric Nitrate solution. Elemental analysis (CHN and bromide)
indicated the following percentages:

[00320]      Ion chromatography was carried out using a Metrohm 761 Compact Ion
Chromatograph for the analysis of ions in aqueous solutions. Calibration standards were
prepared from certified 1000 ppm stock solutions. Ion chromatography showed the presence
of 12.38% bromide.
[00321]      In order to examine the effect of removing the water which is retained by the
material, (despite extended periods of drying) a small sample was heated to 100 'C in a TGA
pan and XRPD analysis was then carried out (Figure 58). The analysis indicates some loss in
crystallinity, however, the polymorphic form remains consistent after removing the ca. 0.5%
water by heating. Nevertheless, the material appears to be slightly hygroscopic.
                                         Example 11
                  Large-Scale Preparation of Hydrobromide Salt (1 equiv.)
[00322]      Approximately 1 L of acetone:water (90:10) was added to ca. 319 g of Compound
1 in a 5 L reaction vessel with the reactor temperature set to 4 'C.        A suspension was
obtained.    The suspension was stirred at 450 rpm.       In a separate flask, 1 equivalent of
hydrogen bromide (48%)(ca. 65 mL) was added to ca. 750 mL of acetone:water (90:10). The
acid solution was then added to the 5 L reactor over a 1 hour period, while maintaining a
temperature of ca. 4 'C. After 30 minutes, a further 700 mL of acetone:water (90:10) was
added to the reactor. After the complete addition of the HBr solution, the reactor temperature
was raised to 20 'C for 2 hours.      The reaction was then again cooled to ca. 4 'C and
maintained at this temperature for a further 3 hours. The reaction mixture was then filtered
and dried under vacuum at ambient temperature (ca. 22 'C) for 3 days. The solid was stirred
periodically during the drying process. The yield after drying was 258.1 g (710%).
[00323]      XRPD analysis (Figure 59) carried out on the initial scale-up material while wet,
showed the sample to be highly crystalline. After drying, the solid converted to a different
polymorphic form (Figure 60). The dried material is the same form as that obtained from the
primary salt screen.
[00324]      IR Spectroscopy (Figure 61) showed differences when compared with the
freebase spectrum. The spectrum also appeared consistent with the spectra obtained for the
hydrobromide salt prepared in Examples 1 and 7.

                                            - 79
[00325]     PLM analysis showed a needle-like, fibrous morphology when wet (not shown).
Upon drying and hence polymorph conversion, the needle-like morphology was lost with
small particles resulting.
[00326]     1H  NMR (Figure 62) indicated a number of peak shifts in comparison with the
free base. Trace amounts of acetone were present in the spectrum.
[00327]     TGA/DTA (Figure 63) showed a weight loss from the outset of ca. 0.4%, likely
due to unbound moisture or solvent. No further significant weight losses were seen prior to
degradation at onset ca. 230 'C.     Thus, the material appears to retain ca. 0.5% water at
ambient conditions despite extended periods of drying and therefore appears to be slightly
hygroscopic.
[00328]     DSC analysis (Figure 64) indicated a shallow, broad endotherm from the outset
likely due to unbound solvent/water. A second endotherm was then present at onset ca. 241
'C (peak 245 'C), followed by likely degradation.
[00329]     KF analysis determined the water content of the material to be ca. 0.74%.
[00330]     HPLC purity determination indicated a purity of ca. 99.1%.
[00331]     Slurries of the hydrobromide salt were prepared in buffered aqueous media at pH
1.0 (HCl/KCl buffer), pH 3.0 (citrate buffer), pH 4.5 (citrate buffer) and pH 6.2 (citrate
buffer) as well as in an aqueous solution with pH reduced to below 2 using HBr (48%). The
respective slurries were shaken for a period of 24 hours at 22 'C. The solids were then
removed by filtration and tested by XRPD analysis. The mother liquors were analyzed by
HPLC to determine API solubility. HPLC solubility determination in various pH media
showed the following results:

[00332]      XRPD analysis of the solids recovered after the solubility experiments (Figure
65) showed all samples to correspond predominantly with the input hydrobromide salt
material, with the samples in the pH 3.0, 4.5 and 6.2 buffers showing traces of a form
previously    identified  from disproportionation      studies   and previous   slurring of the
hydrobromide salt in pH buffers > pH 3.

[00334]      A small slurry of the scale-up material was stored for ca. 1.5 months at ca. 4'C.
Upon re-analyzing the material by PLM analysis, the crystals appeared as very flat, rod
shaped particles in comparison to the fibrous, needle-like particles previously observed (not
shown).     The material converted to the same form as the one obtained upon drying with a
change in crystal morphology from fibrous needle-like crystals to flat, rod-like crystals.
XRPD analysis (Figure 66) indicated a diffractogram which corresponded with the dry
hydrobromide salt material (peaks at 7.59, 15.28, 21.10, 23.21, 30.88, 35.54, 43.58 and 47.13
0 2-theta). The peaks appear very sharp with some preferred orientation in the diffractogram.

[00335]    Preparation of Amorphous Material. Hydrobromide salt material was ground
using a Retsch Ball Mill for ca. 25 minutes, with a 5 minute break midway to prevent the
sample from overheating. The sample was then analysed by XRPD to determine form and by
HPLC to check for degradation. Post grinding XRPD analysis showed the hydrobromide salt
material to be amorphous with an HPLC purity of ca.99.5%. (Figure 79).          Amorphous
material was desired in order to both increase the solubility and not to bias the screening
study towards one particular form.
[00336]    Solvent Solubility Screen.    Approximately 10 mg of amorphous hydrobromide
salt was placed in each of 24 vials and 5 volume aliquots of the appropriate solvent system
was added to the vial. Between each addition, the mixture was checked for dissolution. This
procedure was continued until dissolution was observed or until 100 volumes of solvent had
been added. Amorphous hydrobromide salt material was found to be highly soluble in 3 of
the 24 solvent systems but exhibited low solubility in the remaining solvents.          The
approximate solubility values of the amorphous hydrobromide salt in the 24 solvent systems
are presented in Table 12:

[00337]     Temperature Cycling Experiments.         The results obtained from the solubility
approximation experiments were used to prepare slurries for temperature cycling. The slurries
were temperature cycled between 4 'C and 25 'C in 4 hour cycles for a period of 72 hours
(slurries were held at 4 'C for 4 hours followed by a hold at ambient for 4 hours, the
cooling/heating rates after the 4 hour hold periods was ca. 1 'C/min). Solid material was then
recovered for analysis.
[00338]     Crash Cooling Experiments.         Crash cooling experiments were performed by
placing saturated solutions of the material, in each of the 24 selected solvent systems, in
environments of 2 'C and -18 'C for a minimum of 48 hours. Any solid material was then
recovered for analysis.
[00339]     Rapid Evaporation Experiments. Rapid evaporation experiments were conducted
by evaporating the solvents from saturated, filtered solutions of the material, in each of the 24
solvent systems, under vacuum. Any solid material was then recovered and analysed after
the solvent had evaporated to dryness.
[00340]    Anti-solvent Addition Experiments.         Anti-solvent addition experiments were
conducted at ambient temperature by adding the selected anti-solvent to saturated, filtered
solutions of the material, in each of the 24 selected solvent systems. The anti-solvent selected
was heptane, with tert-butylmethyl ether and water being used for solvents immiscible with
heptane. Addition of anti-solvent was continued until there was no further precipitation or
until no more anti-solvent could be added. Any solid material was recovered and analysed
quickly in order to prevent form changes.
[00341]     Slow Evaporation Experiments. Slow evaporation experiments were conducted
by evaporating the solvents from saturated, filtered solutions of the material, in each of the 24

                                             - 83
solvent systems at ambient conditions. Any solid material was then recovered and analysed
after the solvent had evaporated to dryness.
[00342]     Desolvation of Solvated Forms.        Potential solvated forms were subjected to
heating on a TGA instrument to a temperature slightly beyond the initial weight loss. It could
then be determined by subsequent XRPD analysis whether the form had changed as a result
of the loss of solvent molecules. After heating to 180 'C using TGA instrumentation, Form
V solvate was found to have reverted to Form I by XRPD analysis.                The resultant
diffractogram is shown in Figure 80. The attempted desolvation of Form VII resulted in a
gum following heating.
[00343]     Investigation into Wet and Dry Samples of Form I. Initially, wet samples of
Form 1 showed some differences in the XRPD diffractograms to those of the dry samples.
Further investigation, including drying studies followed by XRPD analysis, TGA, and XRPD
analysis with spinning were carried out. For Form I, the wet material showed significant
preferred orientation and shifting was observed in the diffractograms when compared to the
dry material. Figure 81 shows input material Form I compared with a wet sample, and after
stages of drying.
[00344]     The results from the experiments conducted during the primary polymorph screen
are shown in Table 13. Results were obtained from PLM and XRPD analysis. Overall it can
be seen that multiple potential polymorphic forms were identified during the screening
experiments.
    *   Form I was obtained from multiple temperature cycling experiments.
    *   Form III, an anhydrous form, was obtained from rapid evaporation of DMSO, crash
        cooling to 2 'C in ethanol, and anti-solvent addition from acetone, acetonitrile, and
        ethanol.
    *   Form IV, a 1,4-dioxane solvate, was obtained from temperature cycling in 1,4
        dioxane.
    *   Form V, a DMF solvate, was obtained from temperature cycling and rapid
        evaporation from DMF.
    *   Form VI, a DMSO solvate, was obtained from temperature cycling in DMSO.
    *   Form VII, a DMSO solvate, was obtained from slow evaporation from DMSO.

 Secondary Polymorph Screening of Hydrobromide Salt and Developability Assessment
[00345]     Form III hydrobromide salt of Compound 1 (1 equiv.) was obtained during the
primary polymorph screen from multiple experiments. This form was therefore progressed
for scale-up and further analysis.
[00346]     Form III Hydrobromide Salt Preparation. Approximately 500 mg of amorphous
Compound 2 HBr salt material was slurried in ca. 6 mL of acetonitrile. The suspension was
then temperature cycled between 4 and 25 'C in four hour cycles for ca. 2 days.         The
secondary screen analysis was carried out on the material when it was damp, due to the
instability of Form III.
[00347]     During the scale-up of the Form III hydrobromide salt, the material remained
yellow in colour.      XRPD analysis showed the material produced from scale-up to be
crystalline and consistent with the small scale Form III hydrobromide salt diffractogram.
PLM analysis indicated birefringent, needle-like crystals when wet. Hot stage microscopy
indicated that as the solvent dried off between 40 and 50'C, the crystal morphology changed
to more rod-like crystals. By ca. 250 'C, the material was observed to melt. For TGA/DTA
analysis, a damp sample of Form III was placed into the TGA pan. An initial 10.3% weight
loss was observed due to the unbound solvent. The form change which occurs between 40
and 50 'C by hotstage microscopy was masked by the solvent loss. A further endotherm
corresponding with Form I hydrobromide salt was observed at onset ca. 239 'C (peak ca.
245 'C).    DSC analysis indicated an initial endotherm from the outset up to approximately
100 'C. A final endotherm was observed at onset ca. 233 'C (peak ca. 247 'C), which
appears consistent with the Form I melt. IR spectroscopy indicated very small differences
between the IR spectrums of Forms I and III.
[00348]     DVS analysis showed the following observations:
             o Cycle 1 - Sorption 20-90%RH
                    - Sample gradually takes up ca. 1.045% mass.
             o Cycle 2 - Desorption 90-0%RH
                    -    Between 90-0%RH, sample mass decreases gradually by ca. 1.983%.
             o Cycle 3 - Sorption 0-20%RH
                    -    Moisture uptake of ca. 0.535% between 0-20%RH.

                                              - 87
[00349]     The material was observed to be slightly hygroscopic. Post DVS XRPD indicated
that the material converted to Form I hydrobromide salt during DVS analysis.         1H NMR
spectroscopy carried out in deuterated DMSO showed a spectrum which corresponded with
the Form I hydrobromide salt. KF analysis indicated the presence of 1.4% water. HPLC
purity analysis indicated a purity of ca. 99.43%. Ion chromatography indicated the presence
of 12.17% bromide (ca. 12.57% required for 1 equivalent).
[00350]     XRPD analysis carried out on the thermodynamic solubility experiment solids
remaining after 24 hours, indicated that for the pH 6.6 and 4.5 experiments, the Form III
hydrobromide salt converted to a freebase hydrate form, the solid from the pH 3.0 experiment
became amorphous and the solid from the pH 1 experiment remained predominantly
consistent with the Form III hydrobromide, with some loss in crystallinity.
[00351]     7 day Stability Studies at 25 'C, 80 'C, 40 'C/75%RH (open and closed
conditions). Approximately 15 mg of Form III was placed into vials and then exposed to 25
'C, 80 'C and 40 'C/75%RH environments (open and closed vials) for 1 week to determine
stability. The resulting solids were analysed by XRPD and HPLC to establish if any changes
had occurred. The 1 week stability studies carried out in open and closed vials at 25'C, 80'C
and 40'C/75% RH indicated the following results:

[00352]     From the characterisation carried out on Form III, this form was determined to be
a metastable, likely anhydrous form of the hydrobromide salt. Form III was observed to be
very unstable with conversion to Form I occurring upon isolation and drying of the material.
[00353]      Thermodynamic Solubility Studies. Slurries of Form III were created in media of
various pH (pH 1; pH 3; pH 4.5 and pH 6.6) and shaken for ca. 24 hours. After 24 hours, the
slurries were filtered and the solution analysed by HPLC in order to determine the solubility
at the various pH levels. For the buffer solutions, KCl /HCl was used for pH 1 and citrate /
phosphate combinations for pH 3, 4.5 and 6.6 (10 mM). The pH of the solutions was also
measured prior to HPLC analysis. XRPD analysis was carried out on the remaining solids
after 24 hours of shaking.
[00354]     Thermodynamic solubility experiments carried out in buffers pH 1, 3.0, 4.5 and
6.6 indicated the following result:

[00355]      Competitive Slurry Experiments. Competitive slurry experiments were set up in
acetone, isopropanol, acetone:water (80:20) and isopropyl acetate at both room temperature
(ca. 22 0 C) and 60 0C. Approximately 200 mg of each of Forms I and III material was placed
into a vial and 4 mL of the appropriate solvent system was added to produce a slurry. For
each experiment, the slurries were allowed to stir for ca. 3 days. Analysis by XRPD was then
conducted to determine the form of the resultant solid. Competitive slurry experiments of

by XRPD analysis (Figure 82 and Figure 83). Results are summarised in Table 17.

[00356]      From the competitive slurry experiments, Form I was found to be the
thermodynamically most stable form in acetone, isopropanol and isopropyl acetate at both
ambient and 60 0C. In acetone: water (80:20), conversion to an unidentified form resulted
(labelled as Form VIII).
[00357]      Characterization of Form VII.      An initial assessment of Form VIII, obtained
from competitive slurry experiments of Forms I and III in acetone:water (80:20), was made in
order to determine the nature of the form and evaluate whether it is consistent with freebase
material or the HBr salt. The material resulting from the competitive slurry experiments
appeared light yellow in colour. PLM analysis indicated birefringent material with no clearly
defined morphology. After drying under vacuum for ca. 24 hours, the TGA/DTA indicated a
weight loss of 5.2% from the outset followed by a second weight loss of 1.2%, with
endotherms in the DTA trace at ca. 40 0 C and ca. 96 0C. A final endotherm was observed in
the DTA trace at onset ca. 184 0 C (peak ca. 194 0 C). Very little change was observed by
hotstage microscopy prior to the melt at ca. 197       0 C.    DSC analysis indicated a broad
endotherm starting from the outset (peak ca. 93 0 C ) followed by a second endotherm at peak

                                             - 90
ca. 140 'C and a third endotherm at onset ca. 178 'C (peak ca. 193 C). Ion chromatography
indicated a bromide content of 12.8% (approximately 1 equivalent).
[00358]     In order to examine the effect of desolvating/dehydrating Form VIII, the material
was heated to 150 'C in a TGA pan and XRPD analysis was then carried out. The
polymorphic form appeared to remain the same. After heating to 150 'C and carrying out
XRPD analysis, TGA analysis was again carried out on the same material and showed a
weight loss of 6.0% from the outset followed by a second weight loss of 0.9%, with
endotherms in the DTA trace at ca. 42 'C and 96 'C. A final endotherm was observed in the
DTA trace at onset ca. 186 'C (peak ca. 194 C). The sample appeared to re-hydrate when
exposed to atmospheric conditions. This would likely explain the consistency between the
XRPD diffractograms before and after desolvation/dehydration.
[00359]     Hydration Studies at 55 *C. Slurries were created using ca. 200 mg of Form I salt
material in 2 mL of the appropriate solvent system. These were stirred at ca. 55 'C for 6
hours. The solvent systems used are listed in Table 18.

[00360]     Following the hydration studies, material was analysed by XRPD to determine
whether hydration or disproportionation had occurred at the various water activity levels.
XRPD analysis of EtOH:Water samples revealed that, at 1, 2, and 5% water, the resultant
diffractograms corresponded with the Form I input HBr salt material. At 10% water, the HBr

                                              -91
hydrate    was    formed.      The    same    pattern   emerged      for samples  slurried  in
IPA/Acetone(9:1):Water mixtures, where at 1, 2, and 5% water the resultant diffractograms
corresponded with the input Form I HBr salt, however, at 10% water, the HBr hydrate was
obtained. The diffractograms can be seen in Figure 84 and Figure 85.
[00361]     Hydration Studies at 15 'C and 35 'C. Slurries were created using ca. 200 mg of
Form I salt material in 2 mL of the appropriate solvent system. These were stirred at ca. 15
'C and ca. 35 'C for 24 hours. The solvent systems used are listed in Table 19.

[00362]     Following the hydration studies, XRPD analysis of samples revealed that the
resultant diffractograms corresponded with the Form I HBr salt and hydration did not occur at
the 2% water level. The diffractograms can be seen in Figure 86.
[00363]     The results of the polymorph screen for the hydrobromide salt of compound 1
(compound 2 hydrobromide) is depicted in Figure 87. Compound 2 hydrobromide exists in
eight (8) different solid forms, including amorphous, anhydrous, solvated and hydrated
forms. Figure 87 illustrates the interconversion between several of the identified forms, with
Form I exhibiting particular stability under a variety of conditions.

                                        Dog PK Study 1
[00364]     Compound 1 free base and compound 2, as the Form I monohydrobromide (HBr)
salt, were evaluated in a cross-over dog PK study. Compound 1 free base capsule consisted
of compound 1 free base in Vitamin E TPGS and PEG 400 filled into a capsule. The Form I
hydrobromide salt capsule consisted of Form I HBr alone filled into a capsule.

                                                    -  92
[00365]       Compound 1 free base capsule and Form I HBr capsule were dosed orally at 28.5
and 24.5 mg/kg (as active) QD, respectively, to three fasted male non-naive beagle dogs
(body weight range: 10.1 - 10.8 kg) with a 5-day washout period. Approximately 5 mL of
tap water was orally administered to encourage swallowing and ensure delivery of capsules
into the stomach. Plasma samples were collected at pre-dose and 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 24
hours post dose. The plasma concentrations of compound 1 were determined by a liquid
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) method. The results are provided
in Table 20.
[00366]       When compound 1 is administered orally to fasted dogs at 24.5 - 28.5 mg/kg QD,
compound 1 exposure (based on AUC and Cmax) is significantly higher when drug is
administered as the Form I HBr salt compared to the free base form.

                                             Dog PK Study 2
[00367]       Compound 1 free base and compound 2, as the Form I monohydrobromide (HBr)
salt, were evaluated in a cross-over dog PK study in which male dogs were pre-treated with
either pentagastrin (to decrease gastric pH) or famotidine (to increase gastric pH) prior to oral
dosing to control gastric pH. In addition, the effect of food on the systemic exposure to
compound 1 was also evaluated in dogs receiving Form I HBr with pentagastrin pre
treatment. Compound 1 free base capsule consisted of compound 1 free base in Vitamin E

                                            -  93
TPGS and PEG 400 filled into a capsule. The Form I hydrobromide salt capsule consisted of
Form I HBr alone filled into a capsule.
[00368]     Compound 1 free base and Form I HBr capsules were dosed orally at 30 mg/kg
(as active) QD to three non-naive male beagle dogs (body weight range: 9.6 - 10.5 kg) that
were treated prior to dosing with 1) pentagastrin and fasted, 2) famotidine and fasted, or 3)
pentagastrin and fed. There was a minimum 6-day washout between dosing. On the day of
dosing under fed condition, dogs were given 60 gram of a high fat diet (Harlan Teklad
2027C) and allowed to consume all of the food within 15-20 minutes. The animals were
given a 10-minute rest period and then the capsule doses were administered. Plasma samples
were collected at pre-dose and 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 24 hours post dose. The results are
provided in Table 21.
[00369]     When compound 1 was administered orally to dogs at 30 mg/kg QD, compound 1
exposure was significantly higher when drug is administered as the HBr salt compared to the
free base form under both low and high gastric pH conditions. In dogs receiving the free base
capsules under high gastric pH condition, a 32- to 48-fold reduction in compound 1 exposure
was observed compared to that under low pH condition. The effect of varying gastric pH on
the systemic exposure to compound 1, measured as Cmax and AUC, was greatly minimized
when Form I HBr was administered. Administering Form I HBr with food resulted in an
increase in Cmax and AUC of compound 1 in dogs.

                             Administration to Healthy Volunteers
[00370]     The primary objective of the study is to compare the compound 1 pharmacokinetic
(PK) profiles of single doses of Form I monohydrobromide formulations with that of the
compound 1 free base in healthy adult males.
[00371]     This is a single centre non-randomised, open-label, single dose study in healthy
male subjects.     Subjects will be screened for eligibility to participate in the study up to
28 days before dosing. The subjects will be admitted to the clinical unit at approximately
09:00 in the morning on the day prior to dosing (Day-1) and will remain on site until 24 h
after each dose. Each subject will attend a follow-up visit 4 to 6 days after the final dose.
[00372]     One group of 12 subjects will be dosed in an effort to obtain the data described
above. Each subject will receive the following formulations in a crossover investigation.
Dosing will be separated by at least 7 days.
                *    Regimen A: 150 mg compound 1 (free base) capsule
                *    Regimen B: 50 mg as active compound 2 (Form I HBr)tablet formulation
                *    Regimen C: <150 mg as active compound 2 (Form I HBr) tablet
                     formulation
[00373]     All formulations will be dosed in the morning, following an overnight fast.
Subjects will be allowed water up to 2 h before the scheduled dosing time and will be
provided with 240 mL of water at 2 h post-dose. Decaffeinated fluids will be allowed ad
libitum from lunch time on the day of dosing.
[00374]     If, for technical reasons, dosing is delayed for more than 2 h beyond the expected
dosing time, subjects will receive 200 mL of Lucozade Sport at the originally scheduled
dosing time, or earlier if possible.
[00375]     Subjects will be provided with a light snack and then fast from all food and drink
(except water) for a minimum of 8 h on the day prior to dosing until approximately 4 h post
dose at which time lunch will be provided. An evening meal will be provided at

                                              - 95
approximately 9 h post-dose and an evening snack at approximately 14 h post-dose. On
subsequent days, meals will be provided at appropriate times.
[00376]     Venous blood samples will be withdrawn via an indwelling cannula or by
venepuncture at the following times after dosing (hours): 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 4, 8, and 12.
[00377]     The primary endpoint of the study is to compare the PK profiles of a formulation
of Form I HBr with that of compound 1 as a free base by measuring the following
parameters:  Tiag, Cmax, Tmax, AUC(O-Iast), AUC(o-inf,  AUC%extrap, Frei, lambda-z, T1 /2el. The
secondary endpoint of the study is to collect information about the safety and tolerability of
compound 1 (free base) and compound 2 (Form I HBr salt) by assessing: physical
examinations,    safety laboratory tests, vital signs, electrocardiograms         (ECGs), body
temperature and AEs.
[00378]     Plasma concentration data will be tabulated and plotted for each subject for whom
concentrations are quantifiable. PK analysis of the concentration time data obtained will be
performed using appropriate non-compartmental techniques to obtain estimates of the
following PK parameters (where relevant).

                 Assessment of dose proportionality, as appropriate eg Cmax/D; AUC/D
[00379]      The initial 50 mg HBr dose selected for Regimen B (determined by AUC) is
anticipated to be that which is expected to give a similar exposure to the 150 mg free base.
This dose is also expected to provide less patient-to-patient variability.
[00380]      There will be an interim analysis after completion of Regimens A and B during
which the safety, tolerability and PK data will be reviewed. These data will be used to assess
whether dose adjustment is needed. For dose selection to proceed, safety data from a
minimum of 8 evaluable subjects (defined as subjects who have received study drug and have
completed all safety assessments up to 24 h) in a group must be available for review. The
dose selected for Regimen C will be that which is expected to give a similar exposure to the
150 mg free base. However, if the 50 mg HBr dose used in Regimen B exceeds the exposure
of the 150 mg free base, and is well tolerated and within the limits defined within the
protocol, Regimen C will not occur.
[00381]      If the dose is changed, the Form I HBr formulation will be dosed again at the
revised dose (Regimen C). There will then follow a further period of interim analysis to
confirm that the Regimen C dose provides either, 1) a lower active dose as compared to
Regimen A that provides an equivalent or higher exposure and/or provide less patient-to
patient variability, or 2) an active dose similar to that of Regimen A with a higher exposure
and/or provide less patient-to-patient variability.
