                                            Abstract
            A fiber optic cable assembly includes a fiber optic cable and a fiber optic
   connector. The cable includes a jacket having an elongated transverse cross
   sectional profile that defines a major axis and a minor axis. Strength components of
 5 the cable are anchored to the connector. The fiber optic connector includes a multi
    fiber ferrule defining a major axis that is generally perpendicular to the major axis of
   the jacket and a minor axis that is generally perpendicular to the minor axis of the
   jacket. Certain types of connectors include a connector body defining a side
    opening that extends along a length of the connector body; a multi-fiber ferrule
10  configured for lateral insertion into the connector body through the side opening;
    and a cover that mounts over the side opening after the multi-fiber ferrule has been
    inserted into the connector body through the side opening.

                                      TECHNICAL FIELD
10                  The present disclosure relates generally to optical fiber
   communication systems. More particularly, the present disclosure relates to fiber
   optic connectors used in optical fiber communication systems.
                                        BACKGROUND
                    Fiber optic communication systems are becoming prevalent in part
15 because     service  providers    want to    deliver high bandwidth       communication
   capabilities (e.g., data and voice) to customers. Fiber optic communication systems
   employ a network of fiber optic cables to transmit large volumes of data and voice
   signals over relatively long distances. Optical fiber connectors are an important part
   of most fiber optic communication systems.           Fiber optic connectors allow two
20 optical fibers to be quickly optically connected without requiring a splice. Fiber
   optic connectors can be used to optically interconnect two lengths of optical fiber.
   Fiber optic connectors can also be used to interconnect lengths of optical fiber to
   passive and active equipment.
                    A typical fiber optic connector includes a ferrule assembly supported
25 at a distal end of a connector housing. A spring is used to bias the ferrule assembly
   in a distal direction relative to the connector housing. The ferrule functions to
   support an end portion of at least one optical fiber (in the case of a multi-fiber
   ferrule, the ends of multiple fibers are supported). The ferrule has a distal end face
   at which a polished end of the optical fiber is located. When two fiber optic
30 connectors are interconnected, the distal end faces of the ferrules abut one another
                                                 1

   and the ferrules are forced proximally relative to their respective connector housings
   against the bias of their respective springs. With the fiber optic connectors
   connected, their respected optical fibers are coaxially aligned such that the end faces
   of the optical fibers directly oppose one another. In this way, an optical signal can
 5 be transmitted from optical fiber to optical fiber through the aligned end faces of the
   optical fibers. For many fiber optic connector styles, alignment between two fiber
   optic connectors is provided through the use of an intermediate fiber optic adapter.
                   A number of fiber optic connection systems have been developed for
   use in outside environments. Such connection systems typically have a
10 ruggedized/hardened construction adapted for accommodating substantial pull-out
   forces. Such connection systems are also typically sealed to limit moisture
   intrusion. Example fiber optic connection systems adapted for outside use are
   disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 6648520, 7,264,402, 7572065, 7744288, 7762726,
   7744286, 7942590.
15                 Multi-fiber connectors can include splice-on configurations and direct
   termination configurations. For a splice-on configuration, optical fibers are pre
   terminated within a multi-fiber ferrule and the end face of the ferrule is processed
   (e.g., polished and shaped as needed). After processing of the ferrule, the optical
   fibers have polished end faces at a front of the ferrule and also have pigtails that
20 project rearwardly from the ferrule. In use, the multi-fiber ferrule is loaded into a
   connector and the pigtails are spliced to optical fibers corresponding to a fiber optic
   cable desired to be coupled to the connector. Typically, the splice location is
   positioned rearward of the connector (e.g., see U.S. patent application serial No.
    13/106,371, filed May 12, 2011; and titled "Splice Enclosure Arrangement for Fiber
25 Optic Cables," U.S. provisional patent application serial No. 61/421,314, filed
   December 9, 2010, and titled "Splice Enclosure Arrangement for Fiber Optic
   Cables." In a direct termination configuration, the optical fibers of a fiber optic
   cable are terminated directly in a multi-fiber ferrule of a multi-fiber connector
   without using any intermediate splice. What is needed is a multi-fiber connector
30 that can readily accommodate splice-on and direct termination configurations. What
                                                2

   is also needed is a hardened multi-fiber connector that can readily accommodate
   splice-on and direct termination configurations.
                                          SUMMARY
                   One aspect of the present disclosure relates to a multi-fiber connector
 5 that accommodates both spliced-on and direct termination configurations. For
   direct termination configurations, a ferrule can be mounted directly at ends of the
   optical fibers of the cable, the ferrule end face can be processed (e.g., polished,
   shaped, etc.) and then the cable and ferrule assembly can be loaded into the
   connector body. For splice-on configurations, optical fibers are pre-installed in the
10 ferrule and the ferrule is processed. Thereafter, the pigtails of the optical fibers are
   spliced to the fibers of an optical cable and then the assembly is loaded into the
   connector body.
                   Certain example types of fiber optic cable assemblies include a fiber
   optic cable and a fiber optic connector. The fiber optic cable includes a jacket
15 having an elongated transverse cross-sectional profile that defines a major axis and a
   minor axis. The major and minor axes of the jacket are generally perpendicular
   relative to one another. The fiber optic cable also includes optical fibers contained
   within the jacket. The fiber optic cable also includes first and second strength
   components positioned on opposite sides of the optical fibers. The first and second
20 strength components are anchored relative to the fiber optic connector, which
   includes a connector body in which a multi-fiber ferrule is mounted. The multi-fiber
   ferrule defines a major axis and a minor axis. The major and minor axes of the
   multi-fiber ferrule axis are generally perpendicular relative to one another. The
   major axis of the multi-fiber ferrule is generally perpendicular to the major axis of
25 the jacket and the minor axis of the multi-fiber ferrule is generally perpendicular to
   the minor axis of the jacket. During assembly, the multi-fiber ferrule can be side
   loaded into the fiber optic connector.
                   Certain example types of fiber optic connectors include a connector
   body, a multi-fiber ferrule that mounts at a front end of the connector body, and a
30 cover. The connector body has a length that extends along an axis of the connector
   body. The connector body includes front and rear ends separated by the length of
                                                3

   the connector body. The connector body also defines a side opening that extends
   along the length of the connector body. The side opening is arranged and configured
   for allowing the multi-fiber ferrule to be inserted laterally into the connector body
   through the side opening. The cover mounts over the side opening after the multi
 5 fiber ferrule has been inserted into the connector body through the side opening.

                                DETAILED DESCRIPTION
                   Some aspects of this disclosure are directed to certain types of fiber
   optic cable assemblies 100 including a fiber optic cable 105 terminated by a fiber
   optic connector 110 (FIG. 3). In accordance with some aspects, the fiber optic
 5 connector 110 may be part of a hardened (i.e., environmentally sealed) fiber optic
   connector arrangement 108. In some implementations, the fiber optic connector
   arrangement 108 is configured to interface with a second fiber optic cable assembly
   200. In the example shown, the second fiber optic cable assembly 200 includes a
   multi-fiber connector 210 terminating a second fiber optic cable 205.
10                 In other implementations, the fiber optic connector arrangement 108
   is configured to couple to a fiber optic adapter 150 to enable connection to the fiber
   optic connector 210 of the second fiber optic cable assembly 200. For example, in
   FIG. 1, the example adapter 150 enables a first fiber optic connector 110, which
   terminates a first optical cable 105, to mate with a second optic connector 210,
15 which terminates a second optical cable 205. The adapter 150 defines a socket
   configured to receive a connectorized end of the second cable assembly 200. In
   some implementations, the fiber optic adapter 150 is configured to mount within an
   opening defined in a wall, plate, enclosure, or other structure.
                   In some implementations, the fiber optic connector arrangement 108
20 is a hardened (i.e., environmentally sealed) fiber optic connector arrangement 108.
   In some implementations, the adapter 150 is a hardened (i.e., environmentally
   sealed) adapter. In certain implementations, the adapter 150 enables the hardened
   fiber optic connector arrangement 108 to mate with a non-hardened (i.e., unsealed)
   fiber optic connector 210. For example, in FIG. 1, the adapter 150 coupled to the
25 hardened fiber optic connector arrangement 108 is configured to receive a non
   hardened fiber optic connector 210 (e.g., an MPO connector). Certain types of
   hardened fiber optic connector arrangements 108 are configured to mate with other
   hardened fiber optic connector arrangements (e.g., in a plug and receptacle style
   connection).
                                               6

                    FIG. 2 shows one example fiber optic cable 105 including one or
   more optical fibers 106 surrounded by an outer jacket 107. The outer jacket 107 has
    an elongated transverse cross-sectional profile defining a major axis Al and a minor
    axis A2. In the example shown, the transverse cross-sectional profile defined by the
 5  outer jacket 107 is generally rectangular with rounded ends. The major axis Al and
   the minor axis A2 intersect perpendicularly at a lengthwise axis of the cable 105.
    The transverse cross-sectional profile has maximum width that extends along the
   major axis Al and a maximum thickness that extends along the minor axis A2. The
   maximum width of the transverse cross-sectional profile is longer than the maximum
10 thickness of the transverse cross-sectional profile. In one example implementation,
   the fiber optic cable 105 is a flat drop cable.
                    In some implementations, the first and second optical cables 105, 205
   include multiple optical fibers. In such implementations, the fiber optic connectors
    110, 210 are configured to terminate multiple fibers. In other implementations, one
15 or both of the optical cables 105, 205 include only a single optical fiber. In some
    implementations, the outer jacket 107 also defines a first passage 109 that extends
   through the outer jacket 107 along a lengthwise axis of the outer jacket 107. In
    certain implementations, the optical fibers 106 are disposed loose in the first passage
    109. In other implementations, the optical fibers 106 may be ribbonized, buffered,
20  or otherwise contained within the passage 109. In the example shown, the fiber
    optic cable 105 includes twelve optical fibers 106. In other implementations,
   however, the fiber optic cable 105 may include a greater or lesser number of optical
    fibers 106 (e.g., one fiber, two fibers, six fibers, ten fibers, fifteen fibers, twenty-four
    fibers, etc.).
25                  At least one strength component 108 also extends through the outer
   jacket 107 along a lengthwise axis of the outer jacket 107. In the example shown,
    first and second strength members 108 are disposed on opposite sides of the first
   passage 109 along the major axis Al. In other implementations, example fiber optic
    cables 105 may include a single strength component 108. In still other
30  implementations, example fiber optic cables 105 may include additional strength
    components 108. In certain embodiments, each strength components 108 is formed
                                                  7

   by a layer of reinforcing elements (e.g., fibers or yarns such as aramid fibers or
   yarns) embedded or otherwise integrated within a binder to form a reinforcing
   structure. In still other embodiments, each strength component 108 can have a glass
   reinforced polymer (GRP) construction. In some implementations, the strength
 5 component 108 has a round cross-sectional profile. In other implementations, the
   cross-sectional profile of the strength component 108 may be any desired shape
   (e.g., rectangular, oblong, obround, etc.). Other example cable configurations are
   disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 8,041,166, the disclosure of which is hereby
   incorporated herein by reference.
10                  FIG. 3 shows an exploded view of the example fiber optic connector
   arrangement 108 of FIG. 1. The example fiber optic connector arrangement 108
   includes a fiber optic connector 110 having a body 111 and a spring-biased ferrule
   510. A metal reinforcing sleeve 131 mounts over a rear portion 115 of the connector
   body 111. The metal reinforcing sleeve 131 includes a main sleeve body 132 and a
15 lip 133 that projects radially outwardly from the main sleeve body 132. The lip 133
   has a rearwardly facing surface 133a (FIG. 15).
                    An outermost sleeve 134 mounts over the metal reinforcing sleeve
    131. The outermost sleeve 134 includes an internal shoulder having a forwardly
   facing surface 134a (FIG. 15) that abuts the rearwardly facing surface 133a of the lip
20  133 to limit rearward movement of the reinforcing sleeve 131 relative to the
   outermost sleeve 134 (see FIG. 15). In certain implementations, the outermost
   sleeve 134 defines keying features 135 that mate with corresponding keying features
    135b of the connector body 111 to ensure proper rotational alignment before the
   parts when the parts are assembled together. The connector body 111 and the
25 outermost sleeve 134 have a molded plastic construction. An external seal (e.g., an
   O-ring) 139 mounts about the outermost sleeve 134 (see FIGS. 8, 9, and 12). The
   seal 139 provides protection against water, dust, or other contaminants when the
   hardened connector arrangement 108 is mated with another component.
                    A front end piece 130 mounts at the front end 112 of the connector
30 body 111 and connects to the outermost sleeve 134 such that the outermost sleeve
                                                8

    134 and the front end piece 130 are secured in place relative to the connector body
    111 (i.e., the connector body 111 is captured between the pieces). In certain
   implementations, the front end piece 130 snap-fits to the outermost sleeve 134. In
   other implementations, the front end piece 130 otherwise couples to the outermost
 5 sleeve 134. Keying features 135c of the front end piece 130 may align with keying
   features 135a of the outermost sleeve 134 to ensure rotational alignment
   thereinbetween. The front end piece 130 defines a through-opening through which a
   ferrule 510 of the connector 110 passes.
                    A shrink tube 140 (e.g., a shrink fit tube having a heat recoverable
10 layer surrounding an adhesive layer as disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,470,622, the
   disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference herein) and a strain-relief
   boot 143 protect the optical fibers 106 of the cable 105 as the cable exits the
   connector arrangement 108. The shrink tube 140 has a forward section 141 that is
   configured to adherently attach over a rearward section 136 of the outmost sleeve
15  134 and a rearward section 142 that is configured to adherently attach over the cable
    105 when installed. The tube 140 mechanically couples the cable jacket to the
   sleeve 134 and seals the interface between the cable 105 and the sleeve 134. The
   tube 140 mechanically couples the cable jacket to the sleeve 134 and seals the
   interface between the cable 105 and the sleeve 134. The strain-relief boot 143
20 mounts coaxially over the shrink tube 140. The boot 143 and tube 140 are shaped
   and configured to receive the transverse cross-sectional profile of the cable 105 (see
   FIG. 14).
                    A fastener 145 mounts over the outermost sleeve 134 for securing the
   fiber optic connector 110 to a component. In certain implementations, the fastener
25 145 includes a threaded nut. In some implementations, the fastener 145 secures the
   connector 110 to another fiber optic connector (e.g., a hardened fiber optic
   connector). In other implementations, the fastener 145 secures the connector 110 to
   the fiber optic adapter 150. For example, outer threaded region 146 of the fastener
    145 may screw into inner threads of adapter 150.
                                                9

                    FIGS. 4 - 6 show one example implementation of a fiber optic
   connector 110 suitable for terminating a multi-fiber cable, such as cable 105 shown
   in FIG. 2. The fiber optic connector 110 includes a connector body 111, a multi
   fiber ferrule 510 that mounts at a front end 112 of the connector body 111, and a
 5 cover 128. The connector body 111 has a length L (FIG. 4) that extends along an
   axis of the connector body 111. A fiber strain relief boot 508 (FIG. 7) mounts at a
   back side of the ferrule 510. The connector body 111 includes front and rear ends
    112, 113 separated by the length L of the connector body 111. The connector body
    111 has a forward section 114 and a rearward section 115. The forward portion 114
10 defines an interior 116 in which a rear portion of the multi-fiber ferrule 510 is
   disposed. A spring (e.g., a coil spring) 129 also is disposed in the connector interior
    116. The spring 129 biases the multi-fiber ferrule 510 in a forward direction through
   the first end 112 of the connector body 111.
                    The rearward portion 115 defines at least one strength component
15 chamber 117 (see FIG. 5) and a fiber passage 118. In certain implementations, the
   rearward portion 115 defines two strength component chambers 117 (e.g., grooves,
   slots, receptacles). In such implementations, the fiber passage 118 passes in
   between the strength component chambers 117. In certain implementations, the
   inner walls 500 of the connector body 111 taper inwardly from the forward interior
20  116 to the fiber passage 118 to accommodate the strength component chambers 117
   (see FIG. 5). In certain implementations, two fingers 119 extend rearwardly from a
   rear plate 113 of the connector body 111. Each finger 119 includes inwardly
   directed teeth adapted to grip/bite into the cable jacket 107 when the cable 105 is
   attached to the connector 110.
25                  The multi-fiber ferrule 510 is configured to receive polished ends of
   multiple optical fiber portions 102 (see FIG. 6). The multi-fiber ferrule 510 defines
   a major axis A3 and a minor axis A4 (FIGS. 4 and 5). The major and minor axes
   A3, A4 of the multi-fiber ferrule 510 are generally perpendicular relative to one
   another. The major axis A3 of the multi-fiber ferrule 510 is generally perpendicular
30 to the major axis Al of the jacket 107 of the fiber optic cable 105 and the minor axis
   A4 of the multi-fiber ferrule is generally perpendicular to the minor axis A2 of the
                                               10

   jacket 107 of the fiber optic cable 105 (see FIG. 13). The multi-fiber ferrule 510 has
    a width W and a height H (FIG. 6). The multi-fiber ferrule 510 supports ends of a
   plurality of optical fiber portions 102 in openings 101 aligned along a line (e.g., axis
   A3) that extends along the width of the multi-fiber ferrule 510.
 5                  When the connector 110 is fully assembled, the optical fiber portions
    102 extend at least partially through the connector body 111. In some
    implementations, the optical fiber portions 102 are integral with the optical fibers
    106 of the fiber optic cable 105. In such implementations, the fibers 106 of the fiber
    optic cable 105 extend through the fiber passage 118 of the connector body 111 and
10 through the forward interior 116 of the connector body 111. The multi-fiber ferrule
    510 is mounted directly on the optical fibers 106 of the fiber optic cable 105 without
    any intermediate splice. In certain implementations, the optical fibers 106 within the
    fiber optic cable 105 are ribbonized or loose. In some implementations, the fiber
   passage 118 is elongated along the minor axis A2 of the fiber optic cable 105 and
15 ribbonized optical fibers are routed therethrough with the major axis of the ribbon
    aligned with a major axis of the fiber passage 118 (see FIG. 13). In FIG. 13, the
   matrix material binding the fibers in a row is not visible. In FIG. 13A, matrix
   material 502 is schematically shown bonding the fibers 106 together to form the
   ribbon.
20                  In other implementations, the optical fiber portions 102 are spliced to
   the optical fibers 106 of the fiber optic cable 105 at a splice location 103 within the
    connector body 111. In certain implementations, the optical fiber portions 102 are
    fusion spliced to the optical fibers 106 of the fiber optic cable 105, and the splices
    are mechanically reinforced using a re-coat process. In certain implementations, the
25  optical fiber portions 102 are ribbonized. Ribbonized fibers 106 of the fiber optic
    cable 105 extend at least partially through the passage 118 towards the connector
    interior 116. The ribbonized fiber portions 102 are spliced to the ribbonized fibers
    106 at the splice location 103. For example, the fibers 106 and fiber portions 102
   may be fusion spliced. In certain implementations, the splice location 103 is
30 reinforced and protected by a re-coating layer of additional binder or matrix material
    applied around the splice location 103.
                                                11

                   In certain implementations, additional splice protection can be used
   to protect the re-coated splice section. In some implementations, a thin plate 430
   may be disposed adjacent the ribbon and a heat shrink tube is wrapped and shrunk
   around the ribbon and the plate. In one example implementation, the plate 430 is
 5 formed of stainless steel, but may be formed from any desired material (e.g.,
   tempered steel) in other implementations. The additional protection enhances the
   robustness of the splice section while maintaining a low profile. In other
   implementations, a glass strength member (e.g., having a half-round or rectangular
   cross section) is disposed adjacent the fibers instead of the plate. In other
10 implementations, an adhesive layer is applied over the fibers of the splice section
   instead of recoating them.
                   For example, FIG. 16 shows an enlarged view of a section of an
   example optical cable 400 having a plurality of optical fibers 410 formed in a
   ribbon. A plate 430 is disposed at the ribbon to extend across each of the fibers 410
15 and along part of the length of the fibers 410. A heat shrink tube 420 is wrapped
   around both the optical fibers 410 and the plate 430. As shown in FIG. 17, the plate
   430 includes a generally planar (i.e., flat) plate. In some implementations, the plate
   430 is generally rectangular. In certain implementations, the plate 430 has no
   flanges extending outwardly from a rectangular perimeter of the plate 430. In
20 certain implementations, the plate 430 is generally flexible. For example, in certain
   implementations, the plate 430 includes no edge reinforcements or stiffening
   elements. In certain implementations, the plate 430 has uniform flexibility. In some
   implementations, the plate 430 has a constant transverse cross-section (see FIG. 18)
   extending from one end 431 of the plate 430 to an opposite end 432 of the plate 430.
25 In one example implementation, the plate 430 has a rectangular transverse cross
   section (see FIG. 18)
                   In some implementations, the plate 430 has a thickness PT that is no
   greater than about 0.01 inches along the length PL of the plate 430. In certain
   implementations, the plate 430 has a thickness PT that is no greater than about 0.005
30 inches along the length PL of the plate 430. In one example implementation, the
   plate 430 has a constant thickness PT (FIG. 18) of about 0.002 inches. In other
                                                12

   implementations, however, the plate 430 may have any desired thickness. In one
   example implementation, the plate 430 has a height PH (FIG. 19) that is slightly
   greater than a height RH (FIG. 16) of the re-coated ribbon (see FIG. 16), but in other
   implementations may have the same height or a smaller height. In one example
 5 implementation, the plate 430 has a length PL (FIG. 19) that is slightly greater than a
   length of the re-coated ribbon, but in other implementations may have the same
   length or a smaller length. In certain implementations, the plate 430 has a height PH
   that is no greater than about 0.15 inches and a length PL that is no greater than about
    1.2 inches. In certain implementations, the plate 430 has a height PH that is no
10 greater than about 0.13 inches and a length PL that is no greater than about 1 inch.
   In one example implementations, the plate 430 has a height PH of about 0.12 inches
   and a length PL of about 0.925 inches.
                    The connector body 111 also defines a side opening 120 (FIG. 5) that
   extends along at least part of the length L of the connector body 111. The side
15 opening 120 is arranged and configured to allow the multi-fiber ferrule 510 to be
   inserted laterally into the connector body 111 through the side opening 120. In
   certain implementations, the side opening 120 is arranged and configured to allow
   the multi-fiber ferrule 510 and the optical fiber portions 102 to be inserted laterally
   into the connector body 111 through the side opening 120. In certain
20 implementations, the side opening 120 is arranged and configured to allow the
   multi-fiber ferrule 510, the optical fiber portions 102, and the optical fibers 106 to be
   inserted laterally into the connector body 111 through the side opening 120. In this
   way, the optical fibers need not be axially threaded through an opening during the
   loading process.
25                  The cover 128 mounts over the side opening 120 after the multi-fiber
   ferrule 510 has been inserted into the connector body 111 through the side opening
    120. In some implementations, the side opening 120 extends along the length L of
   the connector body 111 for at least fifty percent of the length L of the connector
   body 111. Indeed, in some implementations, the side opening 120 extends along the
30 length L of the connector body 111 for at least 75 percent of the length L of the
   connector body 111. In the example shown, the lateral access is provided along the
                                               13

   length L of the connector body 111 from directly behind a front end plate 506 at the
   front end 112 to the rear end 113 of the connector body 111.
                   In some implementations, the cover 128 includes a first cover section
    121 and a second cover section 125. The first cover section 121 defines a retention
 5 surface 124 that is sized and shaped to be covered by a retaining surface 126 of the
   second cover section 125. In the example shown, the first cover section 121 is
   disposed over a front portion of the side opening 120 and the second cover section
    121 is disposed over a rear portion of the side opening 120. In other
   implementations, the cover 128 is an integral piece. In some implementations, the
10 cover 128 cooperates with the connector body 111 to define one or more of the
   strength component chambers 117. In the example shown in FIG. 13, the cover 128
   cooperates with the connector body 111 to define two strength component chambers
    117 as will be described in more detail herein.
                   The cover 128 includes a spring compression member 122 that
15 axially compresses the spring 129 within the connector body 111 when the cover
    128 is mounted to the connector body 111. In some implementations, the spring
   compression member 122 extends inwardly from the first cover section 121. In
   certain implementations, the spring compression member 122 includes an arm 122
   that is sized and configured to extend laterally across the connector interior 116
20 when the cover 128 is coupled to the connector body 111. In the example shown,
   the spring compression member 122 includes two arms 122 (FIG. 3) extending
   laterally from the first cover section 121. In certain implementations, the arms 122
   are sized to extend laterally across the connector interior 116 from the cover 128 to a
   radially opposite side of the connector body 111. In the example shown in FIG. 7,
25 the arm 122 includes a distal tip 123 (FIGS. 11 and 12) that fits into a slot or recess
   defined in the radially opposite side of the connector body 111.
                   FIG. 6 is a perspective view of the connector 110 with the first cover
   section 121 exploded from the body 111 to reveal part of the forward interior 116.
   A front end piece 130 is exploded forwardly of the front end of the connector body
30 111 to reveal the opening through the front end plate 112. Optical fiber portions 102
                                               14

   extend through the opening. The multi-fiber ferrule 510 also has been exploded
   from the connector body 111 and rotated 900 for ease in comparing the ferrule 510
   to the connector body 111. The side opening 120 in the connector body 111 has a
   maximum cross-dimension CD that is smaller than a width W of the multi-fiber
 5 ferrule 510. When assembled, the ferrule 510 is oriented so that the width W
   extends along a major axis (e.g., see axis A3) of the front end piece 130.
                    FIGS. 7-9 show the multi-fiber ferrule 510 extending through the
   through-opening in the front end plate 506 of the connector body 111. In certain
   implementations, the through-opening has a generally rectangular shape having
10 opposing major sides and opposing minor sides. The ferrule 510 defines rear
   shoulders 51 Oa (FIG. 8) that are sized and shaped to abut interior shoulders S at the
   minor sides of the front plate 506 to inhibit removal of the ferrule 510 from the body
    111 (see FIG. 8). The ferrule 510 is installed in the connector body 111 by sliding
   the ferrule 510 laterally through the side opening 120 of the connector body 111 and
15 sliding the ferrule 510 forwardly through the through-opening in the front plate 506.
                    In some implementations, the through-opening in the front plate 506
   is defined by one or more tapered walls T (see FIGS. 8 and 9). Such tapering may
   facilitate installation of the ferrule 510 in the connector body 111. In certain
   implementations, the through-opening has a transverse cross-sectional area that
20 increases as the through-opening extends along the axis of the connector body 111 in
   a forward direction. In certain implementations, the major sides of the through
   opening diverge from one another as the major sides extend in a forward direction.
   In certain implementations, the minor sides of the through-opening also diverge
   from one another as the major sides extend in a forward direction. In certain
25 implementations, the major and minor sides are planar and are angled at oblique
   angles relative to the axis of the connector body 111.
                    In some implementations, the rear section 115 of the connector body
    111 is configured to receive and retain at least one strength component 108 of a fiber
   optic cable 105. In certain implementations, the rear end 115 of the connector body
30  111 is configured to receive and retain at least two strength components 108 of the
                                                 15

   fiber optic cable105. Strength components 108 of the fiber optic cable 105 are
   anchored relative to the fiber optic connector 111. For example, in certain
   implementations, the rear section 115 of the connector body 111 defines one or more
   chambers 117 in which the strength components 108 may be disposed. In certain
 5 implementations, adhesive may be applied to retain the strength components 108 in
   the chambers 117. In certain implementations, the chambers 117 may include
   inwardly directed teeth or other retention structures to aid in anchoring the strength
   components 108 within the chambers 117.
                    In some implementations, the connector body 111 forms a first
10 portion of each component chamber 117 and the cover 128 (e.g., the second portion
    125 of the cover 128) forms a second portion 127 of each component chamber 117
   (see FIGS. 10 and 11). When the connector 110 is assembled, the cover 128 is
   removed to reveal the side opening 120. The fiber portions 102 are disposed in the
   ferrule 510. If necessary, the fiber portions 102 are spliced to exposed ends of the
15 cable fibers 106. The connector body 111 is installed on the cable 105 (e.g., over
   the splice location 103) by sliding the cable 105 through the side opening 120 so that
   the cable fibers 106 slide into fiber passage 118 and strength components 108 slide
   into the first portions of the component chambers 117. The cover 128 is mounted to
   the connector body 111 to close the side opening 120 and to close the chambers 117.
20 The arms 122 of the cover 128 compress the spring 129 when the cover 128 is
   mounted to the connector body 111. Adhesive may be added to the chambers 117
   during the installation process.
                    Having described the preferred aspects and implementations of the
   present disclosure, modifications and equivalents of the disclosed concepts may
25 readily occur to one skilled in the art. However, it is intended that such
   modifications and equivalents be included within the scope of the claims which are
   appended hereto.
