METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR DATA TRANSMITTING AND DISPLAYING
        A method of data transmitting and displaying content is disclosed. In an
embodiment, a method comprises a data providing unit selecting one or more data
displaying units. The data providing unit provides, to a data processing unit, content for
display on the selected one or more data displaying units. The data processing unit
communicates the provided content to the selected one or more data displaying units for
display and establishes a direct data communication channel between the data providing
unit and each of the selected one or more data displaying units. The direct data
communication channel enables the data providing unit to adjust the content provided for
display during or prior to displaying the content.

      METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR DATA TRANSMITTING AND DISPLAYING
   [0001]      This application is a divisional application of Australian patent application
   <removed-apn> filed on 27 January 2016, the contents of which are herein incorporated by
   reference.
 5 Field
   [0002]      The present invention relates to the field of data transmission, and particularly
   relates to a method and a system for data transmitting and displaying.
   Background
   [0003]       Presently, with the rapid development of science and technology, more and
10 more data needs to be transmitted and displayed, which mainly involves work of the three
   parities: a data provider providing source data, a data processing party processing the
   source data provided by the data provider, and sending the data to a data displaying party
   for displaying. For example, in the field of advertising, an advertiser can be considered as
   the data provider, who provides contents (source data) to be advertised; an advertising
15 agency can be considered as the data processing party, who processes the contents
   provided by the advertiser so as to form an advertisement, and an advertising board
   (including digital display) can be considered as the data displaying party, which is used
   for displaying the contents provided by the advertiser in the form of the advertisement.
   [0004]      However, in such a conventional data transmitting and displaying process, the
20 data provider and the data displaying party are often in communication with each other in
   an off-line manner. That is to say, the data provider is not in direct communication and
   contact with the data displaying party, and would not specifically instruct and adjust the
   location and the form of the contents displayed by the data displaying party. As a result,
   the requirements for real-time data transmitting and controllable data displaying cannot
25 be satisfied. For example, in a conventional advertising architecture, the location of the
   advertising board and the contents displayed on the advertising board cannot be seen by
   the advertiser in real time, and even in a case that the location and contents are known in
   time, the location of the advertising board and the advertising form still cannot be
   adjusted in time by the advertiser, thus the effect and efficiency of the advertising board
30 are limited greatly.

                                                  2
   [0005]     Embodiments of the invention may provide a data transmitting and displaying
   method which enables the data provider to instruct and adjust the data displaying party in
   time, so as to improve the flexibility of data transmitting and displaying, thereby further
   improving the efficiency of data transmitting and displaying and saving the resource
 5 occupied by the data processing party.

   Detailed Description of an Embodiment
   [0027]      A concept of some, but not necessarily all, embodiments of the present
   invention is that: by comprehensively presenting information about the data displaying
   parties, the data provider is enabled to pertinently provide data to be transmitted and
30 displayed. That is to say, a basis for select data to be transmitted and displayed, and an

                                                   8
   approach for subsequently adjusting the data displaying, are provided to the data provider,
   thus the flexibility in data transmitting and displaying is improved, the efficiency of data
   transmitting and displaying is effectively improved, and the system resource is saved.
   [0028]     The technical solutions of some embodiments of the present invention will be
 5 described clearly and completely in conjunction with the drawings. Apparently, the
   described embodiments are only some rather than all embodiments of the present
   invention. Any other embodiments obtained from the embodiments of the present
   invention by those skilled in the art without any inventive labor fall within the scope of
   the invention.
10 [0029]     Embodiment 1 of the present invention provides a method for data transmitting
   and displaying. As shown in Figure 1, the method includes the following steps.
   [0030]     Step 110: comprehensively presenting, by a data processing party, information
   about data displaying parties.
   [0031]     The presented information about the data displaying parties at least includes,
15 but not limited to, location and data displaying form of respective the data displaying
   parties.
   [0032]     In a specific application, the data processing party can be, but not limited to, a
   network-side server. Since the location and the data displaying form of each data
   displaying party are somewhat fixed, and information about all data displaying parties is
20 gathered at the data processing party, the data processing party may present the
   information about all data displaying parties in various forms, i.e. may comprehensively
   present the information about the data displaying parties. For example, the information
   can be presented by marking on a map: displaying the location of each data displaying
   party on the map, and marking with corresponding data displaying form at respective
25 locations; or the like.
   [0033]     As an example, in an advertising system, a network-side advertising server is
   the data processing party, and each advertising board is the data displaying party. Thus,
   the network-side advertising server can directionally or non-directionally present the
   location of each subordinate advertising board and the form in which the advertising
30 board displays advertisements. Such a presentation may be on an official website, on an
   indoor or outdoor display screen or the like, in a form such as Google Map or the like;

                                                    9
   alternatively, the location and advertisement displaying form of each advertising board
   can be presented on the advertising board itself in the form of a map; the details will not
   be described herein.
   [0034]      Step 120: selecting, by a data provider, a data displaying party according to the
 5 presented information about the data displaying parties, and uploading the data to be
   displayed.
   [0035]      Specifically, in practice, the data provider may operate based on, but not
   limited to, the following two situations.
   [0036]      A) if the data displaying party on which the data provider desire to display data
10 is in the comprehensively or partially presented data displaying parties, as shown in
   Figure 2, then:
               S1211: sending, by the data provider, a displaying request which includes the
   specific location of the data displaying party desired for data displaying, to the data
   processing party;
15             S1212: receiving displaying feedback information from the data processing
   party; and if it is determined that the data displaying can be performed at the specific
   location, which means the data displaying party that is currently requested for data
   displaying is working normally or is idle to display data, proceeding to step S 1213; if it is
   not determined, stopping the operation;
20             S1213: uploading, by the data provider, the data to be displayed to the data
   processing party.
   [0037]      B) if the data displaying party on which the data provider desire to display data
   is not in the comprehensively or partially presented data displaying parties, as shown in
   Figure 3, then:
25             S 1221: sending, by the data provider, a displaying request which includes the
   specific location desired for data displaying, to the data processing party;
               S 1222: receiving searching feedback information from the data processing
   party; and if a data displaying party is searched out by the data processing party at the
   specific location, and the data displaying party is working normally or is idle to display
30 data, proceeding to S 1223; otherwise, stopping the operation;

                                                   10
              S 1223: uploading, by the data provider, the data to be displayed to the data
   processing party.
   [0038]      For example, in an advertising system, a network-side advertising server is the
   data processing party, advertising boards are the data displaying parties, and an advertiser
 5 is the data provider. If an advertising board exists at the location where the advertiser
   desires to advertise, the advertiser may send an advertising request including the location
   information of the advertising board, to the network-side advertising server; and if it is
   indicated in the advertising feedback information from the network-side advertising
   server that the advertising board is available for advertisement displaying, the advertiser
10 may upload the specific contents to be advertised to the network-side advertising server.
   Otherwise, the operation is ended. If the advertiser does not know whether an advertising
   board exists at the location where the advertiser desires to advertise, the advertiser may
   send an advertising request including the location information where it desires to
   advertise, to the network-side advertising server; and if the network-side advertising
15 server determines, after searching, that an advertising board exists at the location where
   the advertiser desires to advertise, and that the advertising board is available for
   advertisement displaying, the network-side advertising server returns searching feedback
   information to the advertiser, and after receiving the searching feedback information, the
   advertiser may upload the specific contents to be advertised.
20 The above description is only a specific example of the present invention in the field of
   advertising, which is not a limitation and will not be described in details herein.
   [0039]      Step 130: instructing, by the data processing party, the selected data displaying
   party to display the data uploaded by the data provider, establishing a direct link between
   the data provider and the data displaying party, and granting permission for the data
25 provider to adjust the data displaying of the data displaying party.
   [0040]      Specifically, the data processing party instructs the data displaying party
   selected by the data provider to display the uploaded data after receiving the data
   uploaded by the data provider. It should be noted that when instructing to display the
   uploaded data, the starting time and the time duration for displaying the uploaded data
30 may be instructed according to the requirement of the data provider, as long as the staring
   time and the time duration are included in the displaying request sent by the data
   provider, which will not be described in details.

                                                     11
   [0041]     After instructing to display, the data processing party may establish a direct
   link between the data provider and the data displaying party according to the practical
   situation, and grant permission to the data provider to adjust the displaying of the
   uploaded data on the data displaying party, so that the data provider can adjust the
 5 uploaded data without the involvement of the data processing party. The direct link
   between the data provider and the data displaying party can be implemented through
   wireless devices such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, mobile phone or the like, and the present
   invention is not so limited. The adjusting by the data provider can include, but not limited
   to, deleting, updating, modifying or replacing the data uploaded and displayed, or the like,
10 and the present invention is not so limited.
   [0042]     Furthermore, based on the above embodiment, embodiment 2 of the present
   invention also provides a method for data transmitting and displaying. This method has
   the same basic flow as the above described embodiment 1, and the difference lies in that
   this method further includes the following steps.
15 [0043]      Step 140: authenticating, by the data processing party, the identity of the data
   provider and auditing the uploaded data, before instructing the data displaying party to
   display data; and if the authentication and the audit is passed, instructing the data
   displaying party to display the data; otherwise, stopping the operation.
   [0044]     In practical applications, the identity authenticating and the data auditing in the
20 present embodiment are one of the indispensable conditions; of course, other conditions
   are not excluded. For example, in the field of advertising, conditions such as expense
   confirming, time authenticating or the like can also be included, which will not be
   described in details herein. Particularly, it should be noted that the contents and the form
   of the data auditing in the present embodiment can both be implemented by known
25 technologies. For example, it may be audited whether the data is in conformity with legal
   provisions, whether the data is in the possession of owner, whether the data harms the
   public interests, or the like.
   [0045]     In the present embodiment, the identity authenticating of the data provider
   performed by the data processor can be implemented in, but not limited to, the following
30 manner as shown in Figure 4:
   [0046]      S 141: checking, by the data processing party, whether the data provider is
   already in a trust list; if the data provider is in the trust list, determining that the current

                                                   12
   data provider passes the identity authentication, and if the data provider is not in the trust
   list, proceeding to S142;
   [0047]      S142: acquiring the identity information of the data provider, such as user name
   and log-in password of the data provider, or the like;
 5 [0048]      S143: acquiring the authorization information of the data provider by utilizing
   the identity information of the data provider, and if the authorization information
   indicates that the data provider is authorized, determining that the data provider passes the
   identity authentication; if the data provider is not authorized, stopping the operation.
   [0049]      The method of the above embodiment will be described in details hereinafter
10 with reference to an example in an advertising system. As shown in the embodiment 3
   and in Figure 5, the method includes:
   [0050]      S510: publishing, by the network-side advertising server, a distribution map (as
   shown in Figure 6) of the advertising boards; in the map the location of 8 advertising
   boards are marked as bubbles, and the information about advertising form of a respective
15 advertising board will pop-up when a respective air bubble is triggered;
   [0051]      S520: after the distribution map is obtained by an advertiser terminal and if the
   location where the advertiser desires to advertise is included in the map with an
   advertising board existing there, sending, by the advertiser terminal, an advertising
   request including the location information of the advertising board to the network-side
20 advertising server;
   [0052]      S530: after receiving the advertising request sent by the advertiser terminal and
   if the advertising board requested to display advertisement is working normally or is idle,
   returning, by the network-side advertising server, an acknowledge to the advertiser
   terminal;
25 [0053]      S540: if the advertiser terminal does not obtain the distribution map, or even
   though the distribution map is obtained, the location where the advertise desires to
   advertise is not included in the map, sending, by the advertiser terminal, an advertising
   request including information about the location where the advertiser desires to advertise,
   to the network-side advertising server;
30 [0054]      S550: upon receiving the advertising request sent by the advertiser terminal, the
   network-side advertising server checking whether an advertising board exists at the

                                                   13
   location requested by the advertiser terminal, and if an advertising board exists at the
   location and the advertising board is working normally or idle, then returning, by the
   network-side advertising server, an acknowledgement to the advertiser terminal;
   [0055]      S560: upon receiving the acknowledgement returned by the network-side
 5 advertising server, uploading, by the advertiser terminal, the specific advertisement
   contents to be displayed;
   [0056]      S570: after receiving the specific advertisement contents uploaded by the
   advertiser terminal, authenticating the identity of the advertiser terminal and auditing the
   uploaded specific advertisement contents, by the network-side advertising server; if the
10 advertiser terminal passes the identity authentication and the content passes the auditing,
   then instructing the advertising board at the location to display the uploaded specific
   advertisement contents;
   [0057]      S580: establishing a direct link between the advertiser terminal and the
   advertising board, and granting permission for the advertiser terminal to adjust the
15 uploaded specific advertisement contents displayed on the advertising board, by the
   network-side advertising server.
   [0058]      It can be seen that, with the method of the above embodiment, by
   comprehensively presenting information about the data displaying parties, the data
   provider is enabled to pertinently provide data to be transmitted and displayed. That is to
20 say, a basis for select data to be transmitted and displayed, and an approach for
   subsequently adjusting the data displaying, are provided to the data provider, thus the
   flexibility in data transmitting and displaying is improved, the efficiency of data
   transmitting and displaying is effectively improved, and the system resource is saved.
   [0059]      Based on the above concept, embodiment 4 of the present invention further
25 provides a system for data transmitting and displaying. As shown in Figure 7, the system
   700 includes: a data processing unit 710, a data providing unit 720 and several data
   displaying units 730.
   [0060]      The data processing unit 710 is used for comprehensively presenting
   information about the data displaying units 730, for instructing, after receiving the data
30 uploaded by the data providing unit 720, the data displaying unit 730 selected by the data
   providing unit 720 to display the uploaded data, for establishing a direct link between the

                                                  14
   data providing unit 720 and the selected data displaying unit 730, and for granting a
   permission for the data providing unit 720 to adjust the displaying of the uploaded data by
   the selected data displaying unit 730. The information about the data displaying units 730,
   which is presented by the data processing unit 710, includes at least location and data
 5 displaying form of the respective data displaying units 730.
   [0061]     The data providing unit 720 is used for selecting a data displaying unit 730
   according to the information about the data displaying units 730 presented by the data
   processing unit 710, and for uploading the data to be displayed.
   [0062]     The data displaying unit 730 is used for displaying the data uploaded by the
10 data providing unit 720 according to the instruction of the data processing unit 710.
   [0063]     Furthermore, the data providing unit 720 includes (not shown in Figure 7): a
   first sending module for sending a displaying request, which includes the specific location
   of the data displaying unit 730 desired for data displaying, to the data processing unit 710
   when the data displaying unit 730 desired by the data providing unit 720 for data
15 displaying is included in the data displaying units 730 comprehensively or partially
   presented; and a first receiving module for receiving displaying feedback information
   from the data processing unit 710, and for performing the uploading if the displaying
   feedback information indicates that the data displaying unit 730 requested for data
   displaying is working normally or is idle.
20 [0064]     It should be noted that the data providing unit 720 can further includes (not
   shown in Figure 7): a second sending module for sending a displaying request, which
   includes the specific location desired for data displaying, to the data processing unit 710
   when the data displaying unit 730 desired by the data providing unit 720 for data
   displaying is not included in the comprehensively or partially presented data displaying
25 units 730; and a second receiving module for receiving searching feedback information
   from the data processing unit 710, and for performing the uploading if the searching
   feedback information indicates that a data displaying unit 730 is searched out at the
   specific location by the data processing unit 710 and the data displaying unit 730 is
   working normally or is idle.
30 [0065]     Moreover, the data processing unit 710 further includes (not shown in Figure 7)
   an auditing module for authenticating the identity of the data providing unit 720 and for
   auditing the data uploaded by the data providing unit 720 before instructing the data
