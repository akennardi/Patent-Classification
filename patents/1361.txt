                                             Abstract
The methods include selectively reducing or expanding T cells according to the antigenic
specificity of the T cells. Therefore, the present invention can be used to reduce or eliminate
pathogenic T cells that recognize autoantigens, such as beta cell specific T cells. As such, the
present invention can be used to prevent, treat or ameliorate autoimmune diseases such as
IDDM. Furthermore, the present invention can be used to expand desirable T cells, such as
anti-pathogenic T cells to prevent, treat and/or ameliorate autoimmune diseases.

              COMPOSITIONS AND METHODS FOR THE PREVENTION
                 AND TREATMENT OF AUTOIMMUNE CONDITIONS
[0001]      The United States Government owns rights in the present invention pursuant to
grant 5R01 DK064850-03 from the NIH.
[0002]      This application is a divisional of AU 2013205297, itself a divisional of AU
2008222678, and claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent application number 60/893,530
filed on March 7, 2007, each of which is hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.
                           BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
I.       FIELD OF THE INVENTION
[0003]      This invention embodies compositions and methods related to immunology and
medicine.    In particular the invention is related to diagnostics and therapeutics for the
diagnosis and treatment of autoimmune conditions, particularly diabetes. The reference to
any prior art in this specification is not, and should not be taken as an acknowledgement or
any form of suggestion that such art forms part of the common general knowledge in
Australia.
II.      BACKGROUND
[0004]      Antigen vaccination can be used for the induction of T-cell tolerance in
autoimmunity. Administration of autoantigenic proteins or peptides in solution can blunt the
initiation and/or progression of autoimmunity in experimental models of autoimmune disease
(Wraith et al., 1989; Metzler and Wraith, 1993; Liu and Wraith, 1995; Anderton and Wraith,
1998; Karin et al., 1994).      However, limited clinical trials in humans employing similar
strategies have almost invariably met with failure (Weiner, 1993; Trentham et al., 1993;
McKown et al., 1999; Pozzilli et al., 2000; Group, D.P.T.-T.D.S. 2002; Kappos et al., 2000;
Bielekova et al., 2000). This suggests that the principles guiding the choice and conditions of
treatment are poorly defined and, as a result, inadequate for human application.
[0005]      Spontaneous organ-specific autoimmune disorders result from complex responses
against numerous epitopes in multiple antigens that arise spontaneously in a stochastic and
often unpredictable sequence. This complexity is compounded by the fact that lymphocyte
clones recognizing identical epitopes engage antigen/major histocompatibility complex
(MHC) molecules within a broad range of avidities, the strength of which correlates with
pathogenic potential     (Amrani et al., 2000; Santamaria, 2001; Liblau et al., 2002).
Consequently, the outcome of any immunization strategy for the prevention of autoimmunity
                                                 -1 -

      WO 2008/109852                                                             PCT/US2008/056279
 is likely to be influenced by the choice of autoantigen(s), dose, periodicity of treatment, and
route and form of administration.
 [0006]       Type 1 Diabetes (TID) in mice is associated with autoreactive CD8+ T-cells.
Nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice develop a form of TID, closely resembling human TID, that
results from selective destruction of pancreatic       P cells by T-cells  recognizing a growing list
of autoantigens (Lieberman and DiLorenzo, 2003).                Although initiation of TID clearly
requires the contribution of CD4+ cells, there is compelling evidence that TID is CD8+ T
cell-dependent (Santamaria, 2001; Liblau et al., 2002).              It has been discovered that a
significant fraction of islet-associated CD8+ cells in NOD mice use CDR3-invariant Va17
Ja42+ TCRs, referred to as '8.3-TCR-like' (Santamaria et al., 1995; Verdaguer et al., 1996;
Verdaguer et al., 1997; DiLorenzo et al., 1998). These cells, which recognize the mimotope
NRP-A7 (defined using combinatorial peptide libraries) in the context of the MHC molecule
K (Anderson et al., 1999), are already a significant component of the earliest NOD islet
CD8+ infiltrates (DiLorenzo et al., 1998; Anderson et al., 1999; Amrani et al., 2001), are
diabetogenic (Verdaguer et al., 1996; Verdaguer et al., 1997), and target a peptide from islet
specific glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit-related protein (IGRP) (Lieberman et al.,
2003), a protein of unknown function (Arden et al., 1999; Martin et al., 2001). The CD8+
cells that recognize this peptide (IGRP 2 06- 2 14 , similar to NRP-A7) are unusually frequent in
the circulation (>1/200 CD8+ cells) (Lieberman et al., 2003; Trudeau et al., 2003). Notably,
progression of insulitis to diabetes in NOD mice is invariably accompanied by cyclic
expansion of the circulating IGRP 20 6-2 14-reactive CD8+ pool (Trudeau et al., 2003), and by
avidity maturation of its islet-associated counterpart (Amrani et al., 2000). More recently, it
has been shown that islet-associated CD8+ cells in NOD mice recognize multiple IGRP
epitopes, indicating that IGRP is a dominant autoantigen for CD8+ cells, at least in murine
TID (Han et al., 2005). NOD islet-associated CD8+ cells, particularly those found early on
in the disease process also recognize an insulin epitope (Ins B 15     23 (Wong et al., 1999)).
[0007]       Association studies have suggested that certain HLA class I alleles (i.e., HLA
A*0201) afford susceptibility to human TID (Fennessy et al., 1994; Honeyman et al., 1995;
Tait et al., 1995; Nejentsev et al., 1997; Nakanishi et al., 1999; Robles et al., 2002).
Pathology studies have shown that the insulitis lesions of newly diagnosed patients consist
mostly of (HLA class I-restricted) CD8+ T-cells (Bottazzo et al., 1985; Atkinson and
Maclaren, 1990; Castano and Eisenbarth, 1990; Hanninen et al., 1992; Itoh et al., 1993;
                                                    -2-

      WO 2008/109852                                                       PCT/US2008/056279
Somoza et al., 1994; Atkinson and Maclaren, 1994; Moriwaki et al., 1999; Imagawa et al.,
2001), which are also the predominant cell population in patients treated by transplantation
with pancreas isografts (from identical twins) or allografts (from related donors) (Sibley et
al., 1985; Santamaria et al., 1992).
[0008]       Insulin is a key target of the antibody and CD4+ response in both human and
murine TID (Wong et al., 1999; Palmer et al., 1983; Chentoufi and Polychronakos, 2002;
Toma et al., 2005; Nakayama et al., 2005; Kent et al., 2005). The human insulin B chain
epitope h1nsB 10   18 is presented by HLA-A*0201 to autoreactive CD8+ cells both in islet
transplant recipients (Pinkse et al., 2005) and in the course of spontaneous disease (Toma et
al., 2005).     In addition, four additional peptides have been identified from mouse pre
proinsulin I or 2 that are recognized by islet-associated CD8+ T-cells from HLA-A*0201
transgenic mice in the context of HLA-A*0201.
                                                                                 3
 [0009]       IGRP, which is encoded by a gene (located on chromosome 2q28- 2 (Martin et
al., 2001)) that overlaps a TID susceptibility locus, IDDM7 (2q31) (Pociot and McDermott,
2002; Owerbach, 2000), has also been recently identified as a beta-cell autoantigen of
potential relevance in human TID (Takaki et al., 2006). Two HLA-A*0201-binding epitopes
 of human IGRP (hIGRP 22 8 -236 and hIGRP 265 -273 ) are recognized by islet-associated CD8+
 cells from murine MHC class I-deficient NOD mice expressing an HLA-A*0201 transgene
 (Takaki et al., 2006). Notably, the islet-associated CD8+ T-cells of these 'humanized' HLA
 A*0201-transgenic mice were cytotoxic to HLA-A*0201-positive human islets (Takaki et al.,
 2006).
  [0010]       TID in NOD mice can be prevented by expansion of low avidity autoreactive
  CD8+ T-cells. Administration of soluble peptides (without adjuvant) is an effective way of
  inducing antigen-specific T-cell tolerance (Aichele et al., 1994; Toes et al., 1996).
  Previously, it was shown that treatment of pre-diabetic NOD mice with soluble NRP-A7
  blunted avidity maturation of the IGRP 2 06-214-reactive CD8+ subset by selectively deleting
  clonotypes expressing TCRs with the highest affinity for peptide/MHC (Amrani et al., 2000).
  These observations raised the possibility that NRP-A7's anti-T1D activity was mediated also
  by fostering occupation of the 'high avidity clonotype niche' (emptied by NRP-A7 treatment)
  by 'low avidity' (and potentially anti-diabetogenic) clones. To test this hypothesis, altered
  peptide ligands (APLs) were identified with partial, full or super agonistic activity for
                                                  -3 -

      WO 2008/109852                                                             PCT/US2008/056279
  IGRP 2 06- 2 14 -reactive CD8+ T-cells and compared their anti-TID activity over a wide dose
  range.
  [0011]          Chronic treatment with moderate doses of an intermediate affinity APL (NRP-A7)
  or high doses of a low affinity APL (NRP-14) afforded TID protection. This was associated
  with local accumulation of low avidity IGRP 206-2 14-reactive CD8+ cells at the expense of their
  high avidity counterparts, which were deleted. Unexpectedly, chronic treatment with high
  doses of a high affinity APL (NRP-V7) or the natural ligand (IGRP 206 -2 14 ) only afforded
 marginal protection.        Strikingly, the islets of these mice contained almost no IGRP 206 -2 14
 reactive CD8+ cells, but increased populations of CD8+ cells recognizing other IGRP
 epitopes. This led us to conclude that peptide therapy in autoimmunity may be most effective
 when it fosters occupation of the target organ lymphocyte niche by non-pathogenic, low
 avidity clones (Han et al., 2005), a prediction supported by mathematical modeling (Maree et
 al., 2006). Unfortunately, this outcome occurred only within a narrow range of APL dose
 and avidity (for target TCRs), suggesting that peptide therapy is ill-suited to prevent or cure
 TID.
 [0012]          Thus, there remains a need for additional compositions and related methods for
 the treatment of diabetes, as well as other autoimmune disorders.
                                  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
 [0013]          It would be difficult to treat a patient with peptides because, as is the case of
 IGRP, this would require several milligrams of peptides per dose. Delivery of antigen/MHC
 complexes, e.g., peptide/MHC/particle complexes (without costimulatory molecules), on
particles were contemplated.           These complexes, it turns out, are more tolerogenic than
peptides alone.
 [0014]         Aspects and embodiments of this application include the discovery of a new
paradigm in the treatment of autoimmunity.               Traditionally, vaccines have been used to
expand T-cells capable of affording protection against pathogens or cancer, or to delete T
cells capable of causing autoimmunity. Aspects of the present invention relate to a novel
type of 'vaccine' that selectively induces the expansion of autoreactive CD8+ cells with anti
autoimmune properties and, at the same time, the deletion of autoreactive CD8+ cells with
pathogenic (autoimmune) properties, both according to the antigenic specificity of the T cells.
The anti-autoimmune autoreactive CD8+ T-cells (anti-pathogenic CD8+ cells) suppress
                                                     -4-

        WO 2008/109852                                                         PCT/US2008/056279
autoreactive T-cell responses in a tissue-specific (upon spontaneous recruitment to the target
tissue) but antigen-non-specific manner (e.g., locally suppressing other autoreactive T-cell
responses).       As a result, treatment with this type of vaccine can both prevent and/or
ameliorate TlD, as well as restore normoglycemia or reduce glucose levels in hyperglycemic
NOD mice without causing generalized immunosuppression. This strategy can be applicable
to the treatment of other T-cell mediated autoimmune diseases and may be able to prevent
TiD recurrence upon islet transplantation.
 [0015]        Certain embodiments of the present invention relate to methods of selectively
reducing or expanding T cells according to the antigenic specificity of the T cells. Therefore,
 the present invention can be used to reduce or eliminate T cells that recognize autoantigens,
 such as    P cell specific T cells. As such, the present invention can be used to prevent, treat, or
 ameliorate autoimmune diseases such as IDDM. Furthermore, the present invention can be
 used to expand desirable T cells, such as T cells that recognize tumor antigens, to prevent,
 treat and/or ameliorate diseases battled by these T cells.
  [0016]       Embodiments of the invention are directed to methods of diagnosing, preventing,
  or treating an autoimmune disorder comprising administering an antigen/MHC/particle
  complex to a subject in an amount sufficient to expand non-pathogenic or anti-pathogenic
  autoreactive T cells. An antigen includes, but is not limited to all or part of a peptide, nucleic
  acid, carbohydrate, lipid or other molecule or compound that can modulate the activity of T
  cells or T cell populations, when in the context of a MHC or MHC like molecule coupled to a
  substrate.
   [0017]       Embodiments of the invention include tolerogenic particles comprising a
   microparticle or nanoparticle coupled to an antigen-MHC complex.              The antigen-MHC
   complex may be coupled directly to a particle or via a linker. A microparticle or nanoparticle
   can comprise various layers which in turn may comprise multiple components (e.g., a metal
   core with a covering or shell of other molecules that can be more easily coupled to the
   antigen-MHC complex (e.g, streptavidin or avidin or other know molecules used to attach
   moieties to nanoparticles). In certain aspects, a microparticle or nanoparticle comprises a
   material selected from the group consisting of cadmium selenide, titanium, titanium dioxide,
    tin, tin oxide, silicon, silicon dioxide iron, iron III oxide, silver, nickel, gold, copper,
    aluminum, steel, cobalt-chrome alloy, titanium alloy, brushite, tricalcium phosphate, alumina,

pernicious anemia, hypoparathyroidism, and/or rheumatoid arthritis.         In certain aspects, a
peptide component of an antigen/MHC/particle complex is derived or designed from an
autoantigen or an autoantigen epitope, or a mimic thereof, involved in the autoimmune
response to be probed, modulated, or blunted by the treatment.          In particular aspects, the
autoantigen is a peptide, carbohydrate, or lipid.      In certain aspects, an autoantigen is an
fragment, epitope, or peptide of a protein, carbohydrate, or lipid expressed by certain cells of
a subject, such as pancreatic beta cells, and include, but is not limited to a fragment of IGRP,
Insulin, GAD or IA-2 protein. Various such proteins or epitopes have been identified for a
variety of autoimmune conditions. The autoantigen may be a peptide, carbohydrate, lipid or
the like derived from a second endocrine or neurocrine component, such as peri-islet
Schwann cell or the like.
[0024]      In still further aspects     of this invention, the MHC          component      of the
antigen/MHC/particle complex is a classical or non-classical MHC class I or MHC class II
polypeptide component. The MHC class I component can comprise all or part of a HLA-A,
HLA-B, HLA-C, HLA-E, HLA-F, HLA-G molecule, particularly all or part of a HLA-A
molecule, such as a HLA-A*0201 MHC class I molecule. The non-classical MHC class I
component can comprise CD1-like molecules. An MHC class II component may comprise
all or part of a HLA-DR, HLA-DQ, or HLA-DP.               In certain aspects, the antigen/MHC
complex     is  covalently   or   non-covalently    coupled     or   attached    to   a   substrate
(antigen/MHC/particle complex). The substrate is typically a microparticle or nanoparticle.
In particular, the particle comprises a metal, such as iron or iron oxide.         Peptides of the
invention can be chemically coupled to a substrate and in particular coupled via a chemical or
a peptide linker. CDl molecules are an example of a non-classical MHC molecules. Non
classical MHC molecules are characterized as non-polymorphic, conserved among species
and possessing narrow, deep, hydrophobic ligand binding pockets. These binding pockets are
capable of presenting glycolipids and phospholipids to Natural Killer T (NKT) cells. NKT
cells represent a unique lymphocyte population that co-express NK cell markers and a semi
                                                -8-

invariant T cell receptor (TCR). They are implicated in the regulation of immune responses
associated with a broad range of diseases.
[0025]      In certain embodiments, the T cells expanded by the treatment have been pre
activated by the disease process and have a memory phenotype. In one aspect, T cells arise
from autoreactive precursors recognizing the target epitope with low avidity. Avidity can be
determined by a tetramer          binding assay or the like.        In a further      aspect, the
antigen/MHC/particle complex is administered prior, after or both prior to and after the onset
of clinical symptoms of the autoimmune disease of interest.        In still a further aspect, the
method may include a step that comprises assessing a biological parameter of an autoimmune
condition, such as the subjects blood sugar levels before and/or after treatment. The methods
of the invention may also include assessing a subject's autoimmune status, including the
assessment of any autoreactive immune responses. In certain aspects, a T cell is a CD4* or
CD8* T cell or a NK T (NKT) cell.
[0026]      Further embodiments of the invention include methods of expanding non
pathogenic    or     anti-pathogenic  autoreactive   T   cells  comprising    administering    an
antigen/MHC/particle complex in an amount sufficient to stimulate expansion of a non
pathogenic or anti-pathogenic autoreactive T cell. In certain aspects the T cell is a CD8* or a
CD4* T cell or a NKT cell.
[0027]      In still further embodiments, the invention includes methods for protecting cells of
a subject, such as a pancreatic islet cells, from an autoimmune response, particularly a
pathogenic     autoimmune       response,   comprising    administering    to   a    subject   an
antigen/MHC/particle complex in an amount sufficient to inhibit the destruction of the cells
or tissues comprising the cells, wherein the antigen or antigenic molecule from which it is
derived is from an autoantigen associated with cells.
[0028]      In yet a further embodiment, the invention includes methods for diagnosing
autoimmunity comprising assessing treatment-induced expansion of non-pathogenic or anti
pathogenic CD8+ or CD4+ T cell responses as an indication of active autoimmunity.
[0029]      Embodiments of the invention may include methods for preventing, ameliorating,
or treating rejection of transplanted tissues by allogeneic or autoimmune responses by
administering an antigen/MHC complex operatively coupled to a substrate (i.e., an
antigen/MHC/particle complex) to a subject in an amount sufficient to expand non
                                                 -9-

      WO 2008/109852                                                         PCT/US2008/056279
pathogenic or anti-pathogenic autoreactive T cells, or inducing expansion of non-pathogenic
or anti-pathogenic cells recognizing alloantigens or autoantigens expressed by transplanted
tissues or organs.
[0030]       Embodiments of the invention provide methods of increasing or maintaining the
number of functional cells, e.g., islet cells, of a predetermined type in a mammal by
preventing cell death or killing. In certain embodiments, this method is used to treat an
autoimmune disease where endogenous cell and/or tissue regeneration is desired.            Such
 autoimmune diseases include, without limitation, diabetes melitus, multiple sclerosis,
premature ovarian failure, scleroderm, Sjogren's disease, lupus, vitelego, alopecia (baldness),
 polyglandular failure, Grave's disease, hypothyroidism, polymyosititis, pemphigus, Crohn's
 disease, colititis, autoimmune hepatitis, hypopituitarism, myocardititis, Addison's disease,
 autoimmune skin diseases, uveititis, pernicious anemia, hypoparathyroidism, rheumatoid
 arthritis and the like. One aspect of the invention provides a novel two-part therapeutic
 approach to ablate existing autoimmunity while re-educating the immune system.
 [0031]      An antigen/MHC/particle        complex   refers  to presentation   of a peptide,
 carbohydrate, lipid, or other antigenic segment, fragment, or epitope of an antigenic molecule
 or protein (i.e., self peptide or autoantigen) on a surface, such as a microparticle or
 nanoparticle. "Antigen" as used herein refers to all, part, fragment, or segment of a molecule
 that can induce an immune response in a subject or an expansion of non-pathogenic cells.
  [0032]      In certain aspects, the antigen/MHC/particle complex need not be administered
 with an adjuvant in order to induce an immune response, e.g., an antibody response. In
 particular embodiments, the antigen/MHC/particle composition can be used in conjunction
  with well known polyclonal and monoclonal antibody techniques to produce an antibody
  using reduced or no adjuvant(s).
  [0033]      By "killing" or "kills" it is meant to cause cell death by apoptosis or necrosis.
  Apoptosis or necrosis can be mediated by any cell death pathway.
   [0034]     "Autoimmune cells" include, for example, adult splenocytes, T lymphocytes, B
   lymphocytes, and cells of bone marrow origin, such as defective antigen presenting cells of a
  mammal, that have activity towards the organism from which the autoimmune cell is derived.

 [0035]      A "mimic" is an analog of a given ligand or peptide, wherein the analog is
 substantially similar to the ligand.    "Substantially similar" means that the analog has a
 binding profile similar to the ligand except the mimic has one or more functional groups or
 modifications that collectively accounts for less than about 50%, less than about 40%, less
 than about 30%, or less than about 20%, of the molecular weight of the ligand.
 [0036]      An "effective amount" is an amount sufficient to achieve the intended purpose,
 e.g., modulation of T cell activity or T cell populations. As described herein in detail, the
 effective amount, or dosage, depends on the purpose and the antigen and can be determined
 according to the present disclosure.
 [0037]      An "auto-reactive T cell" is a T cell that recognizes an "auto-antigen", which is a
molecule produced and contained by the same individual that contains the T cell.
 [0038]      A "pathogenic T cell" is a T cell that is harmful to a subject containing the T cell.
Whereas, a non-pathogenic T cell is not substantially harmful to a subject, and an anti
pathogenic T cells reduces, ameliorates, inhibits, or negates the harm of a pathogenic T cell.
[0039]       The terms "inhibiting," "reducing," or "prevention," or any variation of these
terms, when used in the claims and/or the specification includes any measurable decrease or
complete inhibition to achieve a desired result.
[0040]       The use of the word "a" or "an" when used in conjunction with the term
"comprising" in the claims and/or the specification may mean "one," but it is also consistent
with the meaning of "one or more," "at least one," and "one or more than one."
[0041]      Throughout this application, the term "about" is used to indicate that a value
includes the standard deviation of error for the device or method being employed to
determine the value.
[0042]      The use of the term "or" in the claims is used to mean "and/or" unless explicitly
indicated to refer to alternatives only or the alternatives are mutually exclusive, although the
disclosure supports a definition that refers to only alternatives and "and/or."

of comprising, such as "comprise" and "comprises"), "having" (and any form of having, such
as "have" and "has"), "including" (and any form of including, such as "includes" and

 [0045]      The following drawings form part of the present specification and are included to
 further demonstrate certain aspects of the present invention. The invention may be better
 understood by reference to one or more of these drawings in combination with the detailed
 description of specific embodiments presented herein.
 [0046]       FIGS. 1A-C. Tolerogenic properties of solid-bound peptide/MHC complexes.
 Intravenous injections of solid-bound peptide/MHC complexes into 8.3-NOD mice induces
 T-cell deletion (FIG. 1A), and renders non-deleted antigen-activated (FIG. 1B) CD8+ T-cells
 hyporesponsive to antigen stimulation ex-vivo (FIG. 1C).
  [0047]      FIG. 2. Systemic administration of NRP-V7/Kd-np in young NOD mice
  resulted in diabetes protection. NOD mice were injected intravenously with 7.5 mg of
  NRP-V7/K np at 4, 6 and 8 weeks of age, and every three weeks thereafter until 32 weeks of
  age. 85% of the NRP-V7/K np-treated animals (n = 21) remained diabetes-free at 32 weeks
  of age, compared to 36% and 23% in the control-np-treated (n = 25) and untreated group (n
  65), respectively.

   NOD mice vs. untreated NOD mice (n = 5, 5, and 10, repectively).         Ten week-old NOD
   females were injected with two doses of the respective np per week for the duration of 5
   weeks. Sera were collected 6 hours after the last injection and subjected to 20-plex cytokine
   analysis using Luminex beads array technology.

[0050)       FIGS. 5A-5E. Systemic administration of NRP-V7/Kd-np in young NOD mice
resulted in the expansion of tetramer-positive CD8+ T cells.            FIG. 5A, NRP-V7/K -np
treatment expanded NRP-V7/Kd tetramer+ cells within the CD8+ T cell population in the
peripheral blood (n = 4) and the islet-infiltrates.(n = 11), compared to control-np treated
animals (n = 4 and 21 for blood and islet, respectively). FIG. 5B, The expanded tetramer+ T
cells in the pancreatic islets bind peptide/MHC with low avidity. Kd = 10.21 ± 1.65 nM in
the NRP-V7/Kd-np-treated animals, compared to Kd = 4.42 ± 0.87 nM in the control animals
(n   = 5 and 12, respectively). FIG. 5C and FIG. 5D, The protective effect of NRP-V7/Kd np is
dose-dependent (FIG. 5C) and corresponds to the degree of expansion of NRP-V7/Kd
tetramer+ cells in the peripheral blood (FIG. 5D). Animals were injected with either full (7.5
 ptg per injection), 1/5 (1.5   tg per injection), or 1/20 (0.375 tg per injection) doses of np
 following identical injection schedules (as described above) (n = 21,               12, and 13,
 respectively). FIG. 5E, The expansion of NRP-V7/Kd tetramer+ CD8+ T cells is dependent
 on the number of injections (n = 10). Ten-week-old NOD females were injected with 10 full
 doses of NRP-V7/K -np at two injections per week. The animals were bled after 4 and 10
 injections, and the percentages of NRP-V7/Kd tetramer+ cells in the blood were determined.

 T-cells.   FIG. 6A and FIG. 6B, 17.4a/8.3p-NOD (FIG. 6A) or 17.6a/8.3p-NOD (FIG. 6B)
 mice were untreated or treated with a single injection of 10 full dose-equivalent of NRP
  V7/Kd-np and sacrificed 20 hours later. Splenic CD8+, CD4+, CD 11 c+ and CD 11 b+ and
  B220+ cells were assessed for np binding based on MFI of the np-associated FITC
  fluorophore (n = 1 for each strain). FIG. 6C, NOD mice were untreated or treated with two
  full doses of NRP-V7/Kd-np every week for the duration of 5 weeks, starting at 10 weeks of
  age, and sacrificed 20 hours after the last np injection. Splenic CD8+, CD4+, CD 11 c+ and
  CD1lb+ cells were assessed for np binding based on MFI of the np-associated FITC
  fluorophore (n = 2). Note that a small peak of fluorescently labeled cells appears exclusively
  in the CD8+ T-cell subset.
   [0052]     FIGS. 7A-7D. Systemic administration of DMK 138 -146/Db-np in young NOD
   mice resulted in the selective expansion of DMK 138 .146-reactive CD8+ T cells and
   afforded diabetes protection. FIG. 7A, NOD mice treated with DMK138.14 6/Db-np following
   the same schedule as in FIG. 5 exhibit expansion of DMK 13 8 .14 6/D tetramer+ CD8+ T cells in

weeks of age (n = 18). FIG. 7C and FIG. 7D, The expansion of tetramer+ CD8+ cells is
antigen-specific.    DMK1 38 .146 /D -np treatment does not expand NRP-V7/Kd tetramer+ cells
(blood: n = 4 and 11; islet: n = 21 and 11) (FIG. 7C) and NRP-V7/K -np treatment does not
expand DMK 138 -146/Db tetramer + cells (blood: n = 3 and 4; islets: n = 3 and 2) (FIG. 7D).
FIG. 7E, Representative FACS profiles of peripheral blood CD8+ T-cells in nanoparticle

T-cells to pancreatic islets upon treatment with NRP-V7/Kd- or DMK 138 -146/D -coated
nanoparticles, respectively. Mice received one intravenous injection of nanoparticles once
 every 2-3 weeks, starting at 4 weeks of age. These samples are from mice at the end of
 treatment (-32 wk of age). Islet-associated CD8+ T-cells were assayed for IFN-y production
 in response to IGRP 2 06-21 4 -, DMK 1 38-146-, or Insulin-L (INS-L)-pulsed antigen-presenting

                      DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
[0068]        Observations to date (Han et al., 2005) suggested that, to be effective in
autoimmunity, peptide therapy would have to target multiple epitope specificities.        The
                                               - 18 -

 because, in the case of IGRP alone, this would require several milligrams of peptides per
 dose. Because peptides are much more tolerogenic (i.e., at lower amounts) when bound to
 MHC molecules on fixed APCs (Miller et al., 1979), it was contemplated that systemic
 delivery of antigen/MHC complexes, e.g., peptide/MHC complexes (without costimulatory
 molecules) on particles might be more tolerogenic than peptides alone. This thought evolved
 from the availability of a reagent initially conceived to image islet inflammation.          The
 inventors sought to specifically deliver a probe amenable to magnetic resonance (MR)
 imaging to circulating 8.3-like CD8+ T-cells (iron oxide nanoparticles coated with NRP
 V7/K complexes) (Moore et al., 2004). In particular, the inventors contemplated coating
 these particles with several different antigen/MHC complexes as a way to induce the
 simultaneous deletion of multiple T-cell specificities below the threshold required for TID
 development. One feature of using these nanoparticles for tolerance induction was that their
prototype was approved for use in humans for MRI studies.
 [0069]      Surprisingly, the inventors found that nanoparticles coated with antigen/MHC
 complexes (antigen/MHC/particle complex) expanded, efficiently, consistently, and at very
low doses (corresponding to -0.6 jig of peptide), the type of low-avidity autoreactive CD8+
cells that afforded TID protection in APL-treated mice (Han et al., 2005; Maree et al., 2006).
Another striking observation was that these nanoparticles appear to expand pre-existing pools
of memory autoreactive CD8+ T-cells (i.e., they do not induce memory T cells de novo).
These pre-existing pools are predominantly (if not exclusively) comprised of low avidity
(non-pathogenic/anti-pathogenic)      autoreactive     CD8+   clonotypes.       The  high-avidity
counterparts of these T-cells (with pathogenic activity) do not survive in vivo as memory
cells, possibly, but not limiting the invention to any particular theory, because they undergo
activation-induced cell death upon chronic exposure to their endogenous target beta cell
autoantigen. Another unexpected observation was that these particles need not have to target
a prevalent population of autoreactive CD8+ T-cells to be effective: similar results were
obtained with nanoparticles coated with a subdominant peptide/MHC complex. In addition,
this technology does not require the design of APLs of defined avidity (unlike the case with
peptides), and thus has the potential to accommodate any target antigen or peptide/MHC
target. One of the various attributes of this technology is that it can restore normoglycemia in
NOD mice with newly diagnosed TID, at rates that are at least comparable, if not better, than
those obtained with anti-CD3 mAb treatment, a non-antigen-specific approach that has shown
some promise in clinical trials (Herold et al., 2002; Keymeulen et al., 2005).

[0070]       The inventors have produced autoantigen/MHC complexes that, when delivered
bound to iron oxide particles, expand, efficiently, consistently, and at very low doses
(corresponding to -0.6 pg of peptide), a type of CD8+ cells that afforded protection against
an autoimmune condition. The compositions of the invention can be used to expand pre
existing pools of memory autoreactive CD8+ T-cells (i.e., they do not appear to be able to
induce memory T cells de novo).           These pre-existing pools are predominantly (if not
exclusively) comprised of low avidity (non-pathogenic/anti-pathogenic) autoreactive CD8+
clonotypes. The high-avidity counterparts of these T-cells (with pathogenic activity) do not
survive in vivo as memory cells and predominantly exist as naive T cells. Naive T cells
undergo cell death upon engaging autoantigen/MHC/particle complexes in the absence of
 costimulation and so the invention both deletes naive pathogenic T cells and expands anti
 diabetogenic memory T cells. The compositions described need not target a prevalent
population of autoreactive CD8+ T-cells to be effective.          In certain embodiments, the
 compositions and methods can be used to induce autoreactive T cell tolerance.
 I.      PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS AND ADMINISTRATION
 [0071]      The present invention includes methods for preventing or ameliorating an
 autoreactive condition. As such, the invention contemplates "vaccines" or immune system
 modifiers for use in various embodiments. Compositions proposed to be suitable for use as a
 vaccine may be prepared from autoreactive molecules including autoreactive proteins and
 their fragments. The invention includes compositions that can be used to induce or modify an
 immune response against an autoreactive antigen, e.g., a polypeptide, a peptide, a
 carbohydrate, a lipid or other molecule or molecular fragment and against developing a
 condition or disease caused by such an autoimmune response.
 [0072]       Compositions of the invention may be conventionally administered parenterally,
 by injection, for example, intravenously, subcutaneously, or intramuscularly.      Additional
 formulations which are suitable for other modes of administration include oral formulations.
 Oral    formulations   include    such normally      employed   excipients  as, for example,
 pharmaceutical grades of mannitol, lactose, starch, magnesium stearate, sodium saccharine,
  cellulose, magnesium carbonate and the like. These compositions take the form of solutions,
  suspensions, tablets, pills, capsules, sustained release formulations or powders and contain
  about 10% to about 95% of active ingredient, preferably about 25% to about 70%.
                                                  - 20 -

      WO 2008/109852                                                          PCT/US2008/056279
  [0073]        Typically, compositions of the invention are administered in a manner compatible
  with the dosage formulation, and in such amount as will be therapeutically effective and
  immune modifying. The quantity to be administered depends on the subject to be treated.
  Precise amounts of active ingredient required to be administered depend on the judgment of
  the practitioner. However, suitable dosage ranges are of the order of ten to several hundred
 nanograms or micrograms antigen/MHC/particle complex per administration.                Suitable
 regimes for initial administration and boosters are also variable, but are typified by an initial
 administration followed by subsequent administrations.
  [0074]       The manner of application may be varied widely.          Any of the conventional
 methods for administration of a vaccine are applicable. These are believed to include oral
 application on a solid physiologically acceptable base or in a physiologically acceptable
 dispersion, parenterally, by injection and the like. The dosage of the antigen/MHC/particle
 complex will depend on the route of administration and will vary according to the size and
 health of the subject.
 [0075]        In many instances, it will be desirable to have multiple administrations of a
peptide/MHC/particle complex, about, at most about or at least about 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 or
more. The administrations will normally range from 2 day to twelve week intervals, more
usually from one to two week intervals. Periodic boosters at intervals of 0.5-5 years, usually
two years, will be desirable to maintain the condition of the immune system. The course of
the administrations may be followed by assays for autoreactive immune responses and T cell
activity.
         A.       Combination Therapy
[0076]        The compositions and related methods of the present invention, particularly
administration of a antigen/MHC/particle complex, may also be used in combination with the
administration of traditional therapies.         These include, but are not limited to, the
administration of immunosuppressive or modulating therapies or treatments.
[0077]        In one aspect, it is contemplated that a antigen/MHC/particle complex is used in
conjunction with a cytokine treatment.            Alternatively, antigen/MHC/particle   complex
administration may precede or follow the other treatment by intervals ranging from minutes
to weeks. In embodiments where the other agents and/or antigen/MHC/particle complexes
are administered separately, one would generally ensure that a significant period of time did
                                                 -21 -

     WO 2008/109852                                                          PCT/US2008/056279
not expire between the time of each delivery, such that the agent and antigen/MHC/particle
complex would still be able to exert an advantageously combined effect on the subject. In
such instances, it is contemplated that one may administer both modalities within about 12-24
h of each other and, more preferably, within about 6-12 h of each other. In some situations, it
may be desirable to extend the time period for administration significantly, however, where
several days (2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or 7) to several weeks (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8) lapse between the
respective administrations.
[0078]       Various combinations may be employed, for example antigen/MHC/particle
complex administration is "A" and the additional agent is "B":
            A/B/A    B/A/B    B/B/A     A/A/B    A/B/B    B/A/A    A/B/B/B     B/A/B/B

[0079]       Administration of the peptide-MHC complex compositions of the present
invention to a patient/subject will follow general protocols for the administration of such
compounds, taking into account the toxicity, if any. It is expected that the treatment cycles
would be repeated as necessary. It also is contemplated that various standard therapies, such
 as hydration, may be applied in combination with the described therapy.
         B.      Pharmaceutical Compositions
 [0080]      In some embodiments, pharmaceutical compositions are administered to a subject.
 Different aspects of the present invention involve administering an effective amount of a
 antigen/MHC/particle complex composition to a subject. Additionally, such compositions
 can be administered in combination with modifiers of the immune system.                    Such
 compositions will generally be dissolved or dispersed in a pharmaceutically acceptable
 carrier or aqueous medium.
 [0081]      The phrases "pharmaceutically acceptable" or "pharmacologically acceptable"
 refer to molecular entities and compositions that do not produce an adverse, allergic, or other
 untoward reaction when administered to an animal, or human.                   As used herein,
 "pharmaceutically acceptable carrier" includes any and all solvents, dispersion media,
  coatings, antibacterial and antifungal agents, isotonic and absorption delaying agents, and the
                                                  - 22 -

       WO 2008/109852                                                          PCT/US2008/056279
like. The use of such media and agents for pharmaceutical active substances is well known in
the art. Except insofar as any conventional media or agent is incompatible with the active
ingredients, its use in immunogenic and therapeutic compositions is contemplated.
[0082]        The active compounds of the present invention can be formulated for parenteral
administration, e.g., formulated for injection via the intravenous, intramuscular, sub
cutaneous, or even intraperitoneal routes. The preparation of an aqueous composition that
 contains a antigen/MHC/particle complex that modifies the subject's immune condition will
be known to those of skill in the art in light of the present disclosure. Typically, such
 compositions can be prepared as injectables, either as liquid solutions or suspensions; solid
 forms suitable for use to prepare solutions or suspensions upon the addition of a liquid prior
 to injection can also be prepared; and, the preparations can also be emulsified.
 [0083]       The pharmaceutical forms suitable for injectable use include sterile aqueous
 solutions or dispersions; formulations including sesame oil, peanut oil, or aqueous propylene
 glycol; and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable solutions
 or dispersions. In all cases the form must be sterile and must be fluid to the extent that it may
 be easily injected. It also should be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage
  and must be preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms, such as bacteria
  and fungi.
  [0084]      The compositions may be formulated into a neutral or salt form. Pharmaceutically
  acceptable salts, include the acid addition salts (formed with the free amino groups of the
  protein) and which are formed with inorganic acids such as, for example, hydrochloric or
  phosphoric acids, or such organic acids as acetic, oxalic, tartaric, mandelic, and the like.
  Salts formed with the free carboxyl groups can also be derived from inorganic bases such as,
  for example, sodium, potassium, ammonium, calcium, or ferric hydroxides, and such organic
  bases as isopropylamine, trimethylamine, histidine, procaine and the like.
  [0085]       The carrier also can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example,
  water, ethanol, polyol (for example, glycerol, propylene glycol, and liquid polyethylene
   glycol, and the like), suitable mixtures thereof, and vegetable oils. The proper fluidity can be
  maintained, for example, by the use of a coating, such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the
   required particle size in the case of dispersion, and by the use of surfactants. The prevention
   of the action of microorganisms can be brought about by various antibacterial and antifungal
                                                   - 23 -

 agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, sorbic acid, thimerosal, and the like. In
 many cases, it will be preferable to include isotonic agents, for example, sugars or sodium
 chloride. Prolonged absorption of the injectable compositions can be brought about by the
 use in the compositions of agents delaying absorption, for example, aluminum monostearate
 and gelatin.
 [0086]      Sterile injectable solutions are prepared by incorporating the active compounds in
 the required amount in the appropriate solvent with various of the other ingredients
 enumerated above, as required, followed by filtered sterilization. Generally, dispersions are
prepared by incorporating the various sterilized active ingredients into a sterile vehicle which
 contains the basic dispersion medium and the required other ingredients from those
 enumerated above. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable
solutions, the preferred methods of preparation are vacuum-drying and freeze-drying
techniques, which yield a powder of the active ingredient, plus any additional desired
ingredient from a previously sterile-filtered solution thereof.
 [0087]      Administration of the compositions according to the present invention will
typically be via any common route.            This includes, but is not limited to orthotopic,
intradermal, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intranasal, or intravenous injection.
In certain embodiments, a vaccine composition may be inhaled (e.g., U.S. Patent 6,651,655,
which is specifically incorporated by reference).
[0088]       An effective amount of therapeutic or prophylactic composition is determined
based on the intended goal. The term "unit dose" or "dosage" refers to physically discrete
units suitable for use in a subject, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of the
composition calculated to produce the desired responses discussed above in association with
its administration, i.e., the appropriate route and regimen. The quantity to be administered,
both according to number of treatments and unit dose, depends on the result and/or protection
desired. Precise amounts of the composition also depend on the judgment of the practitioner
and are peculiar to each individual. Factors affecting dose include physical and clinical state
of the subject, route of administration, intended goal of treatment (alleviation of symptoms
versus cure), and potency, stability, and toxicity of the particular composition.          Upon
formulation, solutions will be administered in a manner compatible with the dosage
formulation and in such amount as is therapeutically or prophylactically effective.         The

           C.      In Vitro or Ex Vivo Administration
   [0089]      As used herein, the term in vitro administration refers to manipulations performed
  on cells removed from or outside of a subject, including, but not limited to cells in culture.
  The term ex vivo administration refers to cells which have been manipulated in vitro, and are
  subsequently administered to a subject.          The term in vivo administration includes all
  manipulations performed within a subject, including administrations.
  [0090]       In certain aspects of the present invention, the compositions may be administered
  either in vitro, ex vivo, or in vivo. In certain in vitro embodiments, autologous T cells are
  incubated with compositions of this invention. The cells can then be used for in vitro
  analysis, or alternatively for ex vivo administration.
 II.      MHC COMPLEXES
  [0091]      Antigens, including segments, fragments and other molecules derived from an
 antigenic species, including but not limited to peptides, carbohydrates, lipids or other
 molecules presented by classical and non-classical MHC molecules of the invention are
 typically complexed or operatively coupled to a MHC molecule or derivative thereof.
 Antigen recognition by T lymphocytes is major histocompatibility complex (MHC)
 restricted. A given T lymphocyte will recognize an antigen only when it is bound to a
 particular MHC molecule. In general, T lymphocytes are stimulated only in the presence of
 self MHC molecules, and antigen is recognized as fragments of the antigen bound to self
 MHC molecules. MHC restriction defines T lymphocyte specificity in terms of the antigen
recognized and in terms of the MHC molecule that binds its antigenic fragment(s). In
particular aspects certain antigen will be paired with certain MHC molecules or polypeptides
derived there from.
 [0092]       The term "operatively coupled" or "coated" as used herein, refers to a situation
where individual polypeptide (e.g., MHC) and antigenic (e.g., peptide) components are
combined to form the active complex prior to binding at the target site, for example, an
immune cell. This includes the situation where the individual polypeptide complex
components are synthesized or recombinantly expressed and subsequently isolated and
combined to form a complex, in vitro, prior to administration to a subject; the situation where
                                                  - 25 -

  a chimeric or fusion polypeptide (i.e., each discrete protein component of the complex is
  contained in a single polypeptide chain) is synthesized or recombinantly expressed as an
  intact complex. Typically, polypeptide complexes are added to the microparticles to yield
  microparticles with adsorbed or coupled polypeptide complexes having a ratio of number of
  molecules:number of particle ratios from about, at least about or at most about 0.1, 0.5, 1,
                                                                                               10,
  100, 500, 1000 or more to :1, more typically 0.1:1 to 50:1. The polypeptide content of the
  microparticles can be determined using standard techniques.
          A.     MHC molecules
  [0093]     Intracellular and extracellular antigens present quite different challenges to the
 immune system, both in terms of recognition and of appropriate response. Presentation of
 antigens to T cells is mediated by two distinct classes of molecules MHC class I (MHC-I) and
 MHC class II (MHC-II), which utilize distinct antigen processing pathways. Peptides derived
 from intracellular antigens are presented to CD8* T cells by MHC class I molecules, which
 are expressed on virtually all cells, while extracellular antigen-derived peptides are presented
 to CD4* T cells by MHC-II molecules.           However, there are certain exceptions to this
 dichotomy. Several studies have shown that peptides generated from endocytosed particulate
 or soluble proteins are presented on MHC-I molecules in macrophages as well as in dendritic
 cells.   In certain embodiments of the invention, a particular peptide derived from an
 autoantigen is identified and presented in the peptide/MHC/particle complex in the context of
 an appropriate MHC class I or II polypeptide. In certain aspects, the genetic make up of a
 subject may be assessed to determine which MHC polypeptide is to be used for a particular
patient and a particular set of peptides.
 [0094]      Non-classical MHC molecules are also contemplated for use in MHC complexes
of the invention.     Non-classical MHC molecules are non-polymorphic, conserved among
species, and possess narrow, deep, hydrophobic ligand binding pockets.            These binding
pockets are capable of presenting glycolipids and phospholipids to Natural Killer T (NKT)
cells. NKT cells represent a unique lymphocyte population that co-express NK cell markers
and a semi-invariant T cell receptor (TCR). They are implicated in the regulation of immune
responses associated with a broad range of diseases.

         B.      Antigenic components
[0095]      Certain aspects of the invention include methods and compositions concerning
antigenic compositions including segments, fragments, or epitopes of polypeptides, peptides,
nucleic acids, carbohydrates, lipids and other molecules that provoke or induce an antigenic
response, generally referred to as antigens. In particular, autoantigens, or antigenic segments
or fragments of such autoantigens, which lead to the destruction of a cell via an autoimmune
response, can be identified and used in making a MHC/particle complex described herein.
Such autoantigens can be presented on pancreatic islets or cell supporting pancreatic islet
cells. Embodiments of the invention include compositions and methods for the modulation of
an immune response against a particular cell or set of cells that carry out a particular
physiologic function.
                 1.      Peptide Components and Proteinaceous Compositions
 [0096]      Polypeptides and peptides of the invention may be modified by various amino
acid deletions, insertions, and/or substitutions.         In particular embodiments, modified
polypeptides and/or peptides are capable of modulating an immune response in a subject. As
used herein, a "protein" or "polypeptide" or "peptide" refers to a molecule comprising at least
 five amino acid residues. In some embodiments, a wild-type version of a protein or peptide
 are employed, however, in many embodiments of the invention, a modified protein or
 polypeptide     is   employed     to   generate    a    peptide/MHC/particle    complex.       A
 peptide/MHC/particle complex can be used to generate an immune response and/or to modify
 the T cell population of the immune system (i.e., re-educate the immune system). The terms
 described above may be used interchangeably herein. A "modified protein" or "modified
 polypeptide" or "modified peptide" refers to a protein or polypeptide whose chemical
 structure, particularly its amino acid sequence, is altered with respect to the wild-type protein
 or polypeptide. In some embodiments, a modified protein or polypeptide or peptide has at
 least one modified activity or function (recognizing that proteins or polypeptides or peptides
 may have multiple activities or functions).     It is specifically contemplated that a modified
 protein or polypeptide or peptide may be altered with respect to one activity or function yet
  retain a wild-type activity or function in other respects, such as immunogenicity or ability to
  interact with other cells of the immune system when in the context of an MHC/particle
  complex.

It is contemplated that polypeptides may be mutated by truncation, rendering them shorter
than their corresponding wild-type form, but also they might be altered by fusing or
conjugating a heterologous protein sequence with a particular function (e.g., for presentation
as a protein complex, for enhanced immunogenicity, etc.).
[0099]        As used herein, an "amino molecule" refers to any amino acid, amino acid
derivative, or amino acid mimic known in the art. In certain embodiments, the residues of the
proteinaceous molecule are sequential, without any non-amino molecule interrupting the
sequence of amino molecule residues.          In other embodiments, the sequence may comprise
one or more non-amino molecule moieties.              In particular embodiments, the sequence of
residues of the proteinaceous molecule may be interrupted by one or more non-amino
molecule moieties.
 [00100]      Accordingly, the term proteinaceouss composition" encompasses amino molecule
 sequences comprising at least one of the 20 common amino acids in naturally synthesized
proteins, or at least one modified or unusual amino acid.
 [00101]      Proteinaceous compositions may be made by any technique known to those of
 skill in the art, including (i) the expression of proteins, polypeptides, or peptides through
 standard molecular biological techniques, (ii) the isolation of proteinaceous compounds from
 natural sources, or (iii) the chemical synthesis of proteinaceous materials. The nucleotide as
 well as the protein, polypeptide, and peptide sequences for various genes have been
 previously disclosed, and may be found in the recognized computerized databases. One such
 database is the National Center for Biotechnology Information's GenBank and GenPept
 databases (on the World Wide Web at ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/).             The all or part of the coding
 regions for these genes may be amplified and/or expressed using the techniques disclosed
 herein or as would be know to those of ordinary skill in the art.
  [00102]      Amino acid sequence variants of autoantigenic epitopes and other polypeptides of
  these compositions can be substitutional, insertional, or deletion variants. A modification in a
  polypeptide of the invention may affect 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17,

or more non-contiguous or contiguous amino acids of a peptide or polypeptide, as compared
to wild-type.    A peptide or polypeptide that results in an autoimmune response and in
particular a pathologic autoimmune response are contemplated for use in methods of the
invention.
 [00103]    Deletion variants typically lack one or more residues of the native or wild-type
 amino acid sequence. Individual residues can be deleted or a number of contiguous amino
 acids can be deleted. A stop codon may be introduced (by substitution or insertion) into an
 encoding nucleic acid sequence to generate a truncated protein. Insertional mutants typically
 involve the addition of material at a non-terminal point in the polypeptide. This may include
                                                 - 33 -

the insertion of one or more residues. Terminal additions, called fusion proteins, may also be
generated.
 [00104]     Substitutional variants typically contain the exchange of one amino acid for
another at one or more sites within the protein, and may be designed to modulate one or more
properties of the polypeptide, with or without the loss of other functions or properties.
 Substitutions may be conservative, that is, one amino acid is replaced with one of similar
 shape and charge. Conservative substitutions are well known in the art and include, for
 example, the changes of: alanine to serine; arginine to lysine; asparagine to glutamine or
 histidine; aspartate to glutamate; cysteine to serine; glutamine to asparagine; glutamate to
 aspartate; glycine to proline; histidine to asparagine or glutamine; isoleucine to leucine or
 valine; leucine to valine or isoleucine; lysine to arginine; methionine to leucine or isoleucine;
 phenylalanine to tyrosine, leucine or methionine; serine to threonine; threonine to serine;
 tryptophan to tyrosine; tyrosine to tryptophan or phenylalanine; and valine to isoleucine or
 leucine. Alternatively, substitutions may be non-conservative such that a function or activity
 of a polypeptide or peptide is affected, such as avidity or affinity for a cellular receptor(s).
 Non-conservative changes typically involve substituting a residue with one that is chemically
  dissimilar, such as a polar or charged amino acid for a nonpolar or uncharged amino acid, and
  vice versa.
  [00105]     Proteins of the invention may be recombinant, or synthesized in vitro.
  Alternatively, a recombinant protein may be isolated from bacteria or other host cell.
  [00106]     The term "functionally equivalent codon" is used herein to refer to codons that
  encode the same amino acid, such as the six codons for arginine or serine, and also refers to
  codons that encode biologically equivalent amino acids (see Table 2, below).

 [00107]     It also will be understood that amino acid and nucleic acid sequences may include
additional residues, such as additional N- or C-terminal amino acids, or 5' or 3' nucleic acid

[00109]      The present invention contemplates the administration of a peptide/MHC/particle
complex to effect a diagnosis, treatment or preventative therapy against the development of a
disease or condition associated with autoimmune responses.
[00110]      In addition, U.S. Patent 4,554,101 (Hopp), which is incorporated herein by
reference, teaches the identification and preparation of epitopes from primary amino acid
sequences on the basis of hydrophilicity. Through the methods disclosed in Hopp, one of
skill in the art would be able to identify potential epitopes from within an amino acid
sequence and confirm their immunogenicity.          Numerous scientific publications have also
been devoted to the prediction of secondary structure and to the identification of epitopes,
from analyses of amino acid sequences (Chou & Fasman, 1974a,b; 1978a,b; 1979). Any of
these may be used, if desired, to supplement the teachings of Hopp in U.S. Patent 4,554,101.
                 2.      Other Antigenic Components
 [00111]     Molecules other than peptides can be used as antigens or antigenic fragments in
complex with MHC molecules, such molecules include, but are not limited to carbohydrates,
lipids, small molecules, and the like.      Carbohydrates are major components of the outer
 surface of a variety of cells. Certain carbohydrates are characteristic of different stages of
 differentiation and very often these carbohydrates are recognized by specific antibodies.
 Expression of distinct carbohydrates can be restricted to specific cell types. Autoantibody
 responses to endometrial and serum antigens have been shown to be a common feature of
 endometriosis. There has been described a serum autoantibody response in endometriosis to
 a number of previously identified antigens, including 2-Heremans Schmidt glycoprotein and
 carbonic anhydrase, that is specific for a carbohydrate epitope (Yeaman et al., 2002).
         C.       Substrates / Particles
  [00112]     In certain aspect, antigen/MHC complexes are operatively coupled to a substrate.
 A substrate can be in the form of a particle.         Particles can have a structure of variable
  dimension and known variously as a microsphere, microparticle, nanoparticle, nanosphere, or
  liposome. Such particulate formulations containing an antigen/MHC complex can be formed
 by covalent or non-covalent coupling of the complex to the particle.

[00113]      By    "particle,"  "microparticle,"     "bead," "microsphere,"     and   grammatical
equivalents herein is meant small discrete particles that are administrable to a subject.       In
certain embodiments, the particles are substantially spherical in shape.                The term
"substantially spherical," as used herein, means that the shape of the particles does not
deviate from a sphere by more than about 10%. Various known antigen or peptide complexes
of the invention may be applied to the particles.
[00114]      The particles typically consist of a substantially spherical core and optionally one
or more layers. The core may vary in size and composition.            In addition to the core, the
particle may have one or more layers to provide functionalities appropriate for the
applications of interest. The thicknesses of layers, if present, may vary depending on the
needs of the specific applications. For example, layers may impart useful optical properties.
 [00115]     Layers may also impart chemical or biological functionalities, referred to herein as
chemically active or biologically active layers, and for these functionalities the layer or layers
may typically range in thickness from about 0.001 micrometers (1 nanometer) to about 10
micrometers or more (depending on the desired particle diameter), these layers typically
being applied on the outer surface of the particle.
 [00116]      The compositions of the core and layers may vary.         Suitable materials for the
 particles or the core include, but are not limited to polymers, ceramics, glasses, minerals, and
 the like.   Examples include, but are not limited to, standard and specialty glasses, silica,
 polystyrene, polyester, polycarbonate, acrylic polymers, polyacrylamide, polyacrylonitrile,
 polyamide, fluoropolymers, silicone, celluloses, silicon, metals (e.g., iron, gold, silver),
 minerals (e.g., ruby), nanoparticles (e.g., gold nanoparticles, colloidal particles, metal oxides,
 metal sulfides, metal selenides, and magnetic materials such as iron oxide), and composites
 thereof. The core could be of homogeneous composition, or a composite of two or more
  classes of material depending on the properties desired.             In certain aspects, metal
 nanoparticles will be used. These metal particles or nanoparticles can be formed from Au, Pt,
  Pd, Cu, Ag, Co, Fe, Ni, Mn, Sm, Nd, Pr, Gd, Ti, Zr, Si, and In, precursors, their binary alloys,
  their ternary alloys and their intermetallic compounds. See U.S. Patent 6,712,997, which is
  incorporated herein by reference in its entirety
  [00117]     As previously stated, the particle may, in addition to the core, include one or more
  layers. The purposes for including layers in the microparticle may vary. Alternatively, the

surface of the particle may be functionalized directly. A layer may provide suitable surfaces
for attaching chemical functionalities for chemical binding or coupling sites.
[00118]      Layers can be produced on the microparticles in a variety of ways known to those
skilled in the art. Examples include sol-gel chemistry techniques such as described in Iler
(1979); Brinker and Scherer (1990). Additional approaches to producing layers on particles
include surface chemistry and encapsulation techniques such as described in Partch and
Brown (1998);       Pekareket al. (1994);     Hanprasopwattana (1996); Davies (1998);         and
references therein. Vapor deposition techniques may also be used; see for example Golman
and Shinohara (2000); and U.S. Patent 6,387,498.         Still other approaches include layer-by
layer self-assembly techniques such as described in Sukhorukov et al. (1998); Caruso et al.
(1998); Caruso et al. (1999); U.S. Patent 6,103,379 and references cited therein.
 [00119]     Particles may be formed by contacting an aqueous phase containing the
 antigen/MHC complex and a polymer and a nonaqueous phase followed by evaporation of
the nonaqueous phase to cause the coalescence of particles from the aqueous phase as taught
 in U.S. Patents 4,589,330 or 4,818,542. Preferred polymers for such preparations are natural
 or synthetic copolymers or polymers selected from the group consisting of gleatin agar,
 starch, arabinogalactan, albumin, collagen, polyglycolic acid, polylactic acid, glycolide-L(-)
 lactide poly(episilon-caprolactone, poly(epsilon-caprolactone-CO-lactic acid), poly(epsilon
 caprolactone-CO-glycolic      acid),   poly(P-hydroxy     butyric   acid),  polyethylene   oxide,
 polyethylene, poly(alkyl-2-cyanoacrylate),      poly(hydroxyethyl methacrylate), polyamides,
 poly(amino     acids),  poly(2-hydroxyethyl     DL-aspartamide),      poly(ester  urea),  poly(L
 phenylalanine/ethylene     glycol/ 1,6-diisocyanatohexane)     and   poly(methyl   methacrylate).
 Particularly preferred polymers are polyesters, such as polyglycolic acid, polylactic acid,
 glycolide-L(-) lactide poly(episilon-caprolactone, poly(epsilon-caprolactone-CO-lactic acid),
  and poly(epsilon-caprolactone-CO-glycolic acid. Solvents useful for dissolving the polymer
 include: water, hexafluoroisopropanol, methylenechloride, tetrahydrofuran, hexane, benzene,

  [001203     The term "microparticle" as used herein, refers to a particle of about 10 nm to
  about 150 ptm in diameter, more preferably about 200 nm to about 30 pim in diameter, and
  most preferably about 500 nm to about 10 pum in diameter. Preferably, the microparticle will
  be of a diameter that permits parenteral or mucosal administration without occluding needles
  and capillaries. Microparticle size is readily determined by techniques well known in the art,

         D.      Coupling Antigen-MHC comples with Microparticle or Nanoparticle
 [00121]     In order to couple the substrate or particles to the antigen-MHC comoples the
 following techniques can be applied.
 [00122]     The binding can be generated by chemically modifying the substrate or particle
 which typically involves the generation of "functional groups" on the surface, said functional
 groups being capable of binding to an antigen-MHC complex, and/or linking the optionally
 chemically modified surface of the surface or particle with covalently or non-covalently
bonded so-called "linking molecules," followed by reacting the antigen-MHC complex with
the particles obtained.
[00123]      The term "linking molecule" means a substance capable of linking with the
substrate or particle and also capable of linking to an antigen-MHC complex.
[00124]      The term "functional groups" as used hereinbefore is not restricted to reactive
chemical groups forming covalent bonds, but also includes chemical groups leading to an
ionic interaction or hydrogen bonds with the antigen-MHC complex. Moreover, it should be
noted that a strict distinction between "functional groups" generated at the surface and linking
molecules bearing "functional groups" is not possible, since sometimes the modification of
the surface requires the reaction of smaller linking molecules such as ethylene glycol with the
particle surface.
[00125]     The functional groups or the linking molecules bearing them may be selected from
amino groups, carbonic acid groups, thiols, thioethers, disulfides, guanidino, hydroxyl
                                                -39  -

      WO 2008/109852                                                           PCT/US2008/056279
  groups, amine groups, vicinal dioles, aldehydes, alpha-haloacetyl groups, mercury organyles,
  ester groups, acid halide, acid thioester, acid anhydride, isocyanates, isothiocyanates, sulfonic
 acid halides, imidoesters, diazoacetates, diazonium salts, 1,2-diketones, phosphonic acids,
 phosphoric acid esters, sulfonic acids, azolides, imidazoles, indoles, N-maleimides, alpha
 beta-unsaturated carbonyl compounds, arylhalogenides or their derivatives.
 [00126]     Non-limiting examples for other linking molecules with higher molecular weights
 are nucleic acid molecules, polymers, copolymers, polymerizable coupling agents, silica,
 proteins, and chain-like molecules having a surface with the opposed polarity with respect to
 the substrate or particle. Nucleic acids can provide a link to affinity molecules containing
 themselves nucleic acid molecules, though with a complementary sequence with respect to
 the linking molecule.
 [00127]     As examples for polymerizable coupling agents, diacetylene, styrene butadiene,
 vinylacetate, acrylate, acrylamide, vinyl compounds, styrene, silicone oxide, boron oxide,
phosphorous oxide, borates, pyrrole, polypyrrole and phosphates can be cited.
 [00128]     The surface of the substrate or particle can be chemically modified, for instance
by the binding of phosphonic acid derivatives having functional reactive groups.               One
example     of these phosphonic        acid   or phosphonic     acid ester   derivates  is imino
bis(methylenphosphono) carbonic acid which can be synthesized according to the "Mannich
Moedritzer" reaction. This binding reaction can be performed with substrate or particle as
directly obtained from the preparation process or after a pre-treatment (for instance with
trimethylsilyl bromide).      In the first case the phophonic acid (ester) derivative may for
instance displace components of the reaction medium which are still bound to the surface.
This displacement can be enhanced at higher temperatures. Trimethylsilyl bromide, on the
other hand, is believed to dealkylate alkyl group-containing phosphorous-based complexing
agents, thereby creating new binding sites for the phosphonic acid (ester) derivative. The
phosphonic acid (ester) derivative, or linking molecules bound thereto, may display the same
functional groups as given above. A further example of the surface treatment of the substrate
or particle involves heating in a diole such as ethylene glycol. It should be noted that this
treatment may be redundant if the synthesis already proceeded in a diole.             Under these
circumstances the synthesis product directly obtained is likely to show the necessary
functional groups. This treatment is however applicable to substrate or particle that were
produced in N- or P-containing complexing agents. If such substrate or particle are subjected
                                                  - 40 -

       WO 2008/109852                                                          PCT/US2008/056279
to an after-treatment with ethylene glycol, ingredients of the reaction medium (e.g.
complexing agent) still binding to the surface can be replaced by the diole and/or can be
dealkylated.
 [00129]     It is also possible to replace N-containing complexing agents still bound to the
particle surface by primary amine derivatives having a second functional group. The surface
 of the substrate or particle can also be coated with silica. Silica allows a relatively simple
 chemical conjugation of organic molecules since silica easily reacts with organic linkers,
 such as triethoxysilane or chlorosilane. The particle surface may also be coated by homo- or
 copolymers.       Examples for polymerizable coupling agents are. N-(3-aminopropyl)-3
 mercaptobenzamidine,               3-(trimethoxysilyl)propylhydrazide              and         3
 trimethoxysilyl)propylmaleimide.      Other non-limiting examples of polymerizable coupling
 agents are mentioned herein. These coupling agents can be used singly or in combination
 depending on the type of copolymer to be generated as a coating.
  [00130]     Another surface modification technique that can be used with substrates or
 particles containing oxidic transition metal compounds is conversion of the oxidic transition
 metal compounds by chlorine gas or organic chlorination agents to the corresponding
  oxychlorides. These oxychlorides are capable of reacting with nucleophiles, such as hydroxy
  or amino groups as often found in biomolecules. This technique allows generating a direct
  conjugation with proteins, for instance-via the amino group of lysine side chains. The
  conjugation with proteins after surface modification with oxychlorides can also be effected
  by using a bi-functional linker, such as maleimidopropionic acid hydrazide.
  [00131]     For non-covalent linking techniques, chain-type molecules having a polarity or
  charge opposite to that of the substrate or particle surface are particularly suitable. Examples
  for linking molecules which can be non-covalently linked to core/shell nanoparticles involve
   anionic, cationic or zwitter-ionic surfactants, acid or basic proteins, polyamines, polyamides,
  polysulfone or polycarboxylic acid. The hydrophobic interaction between substrate or
   particle and amphiphilic reagent having a functional reactive group can generate the
   necessary link. In particular, chain-type molecules with amphiphilic character, such as
   phospholipids or derivatised polysaccharides, which can be crosslinked with each other, are
   useful. The absorption of these molecules on the surface can be achieved by coincubation.
   The binding between affinity molecule and substrate or particle can also be based on non
                                                    - 41 -

covalent, self-organising bonds. One example thereof involves simple detection probes with
biotin as linking molecule and avidin- or strepdavidin-coupled molecules.
[00132]      Protocols for coupling reactions of functional groups to biological molecules can
be found in the literature, for instance in "Bioconjugate Techniques" (Greg T. Hermanson,
Academic Press 1996). The biological molecule (e.g., MHC molecule or derivative thereof)
can be coupled to the linking molecule, covalently or non-covalently, in line with standard
procedures of organic chemistry such as oxidation, halogenation, alkylation, acylation,
addition, substitution or amidation. These methods for coupling the covalently or non
covalently bound linking molecule can be applied prior to the coupling of the linking
molecule to the substrate or particle or thereafter. Further, it is possible, by means of
incubation, to effect a direct binding of molecules to correspondingly pre-treated substrte or
particles (for instance by trimethylsilyl bromide), which display a modified surface due to
this pre-treatment (for instance a higher charge or polar surface).
         E.      PROTEIN PRODUCTION
 [00133]     The present invention describes polypeptides, peptides, and proteins for use in
various embodiments of the present invention. For example, specific peptides and their
complexes are assayed for their abilities to elicit or modulate an immune response. In
 specific embodiments, all or part of the peptides or proteins of the invention can also be
 synthesized in solution or on a solid support in accordance with conventional techniques.
 Various automatic synthesizers are commercially available and can be used in accordance
 with known protocols.      See, for example, Stewart and Young (1984); Tam et al. (1983);
 Merrifield (1986); and Barany and Merrifield (1979), each incorporated herein by reference.
 Alternatively, recombinant DNA technology may be employed wherein a nucleotide
 sequence which encodes a peptide of the invention is inserted into an expression vector,
 transformed or transfected into an appropriate host cell and cultivated under conditions
 suitable for expression.
  [00134]     One embodiment of the invention includes the use of gene transfer to cells,
  including microorganisms, for the production of proteins. The gene for the protein of interest
 may be transferred into appropriate host cells followed by culture of cells under the
  appropriate conditions. A nucleic acid encoding virtually any polypeptide may be employed.
  The generation of recombinant expression vectors, and the elements included therein, are
  known to one skilled in the art and are briefly discussed herein. Examples of mammalian
                                                 - 42 -

host cell lines include, but are not limited to Vero and HeLa cells, other B- and T- cell lines,
such as CEM, 721.221, H9, Jurkat, Raji, as well as cell lines of Chinese hamster ovary,
W138, BHK, COS-7, 293, HepG2, 3T3, RIN and MDCK cells. In addition, a host cell strain
may be chosen that modulates the expression of the inserted sequences, or that modifies and
processes the gene product in the manner desired. Such modifications (e.g., glycosylation)
and processing (e.g., cleavage) of protein products may be important for the function of the
protein.     Different host cells have characteristic and specific mechanisms for the post
translational processing and modification of proteins. Appropriate cell lines or host systems
can be chosen to ensure the correct modification and processing of the foreign protein
expressed.
 [00135]      A number of selection systems may be used including, but not limited to HSV
 thymidine kinase, hypoxanthine-guanine             phosphoribosyltransferase,   and adenine
phosphoribosyltransferase genes, in tk-, hgprt- or aprt- cells, respectively. Also, anti
 metabolite resistance can be used as the basis of selection: for dhfr, which confers resistance
 to trimethoprim and methotrexate; gpt, which confers resistance to mycophenolic acid; neo,
 which confers resistance to the aminoglycoside G418; and hygro, which confers resistance to
 hygromycin.
          F.      NUCLEIC ACIDS
  [00136]     The present invention may include recombinant polynucleotides encoding the
  proteins, polypeptides, peptides of the invention.         The nucleic acid sequences for
  autoantigens and MHC molecules for presenting the autoantigens, are included and can be
  used to prepare a peptide/MHC complex.
  [00137]      As used in this application, the term "polynucleotide" refers to a nucleic acid
  molecule that either is recombinant or has been isolated free of total genomic nucleic acid.
  Included within the term "polynucleotide" are oligonucleotides (nucleic acids 100 residues or
   less in length), recombinant vectors, including, for example, plasmids, cosmids, phage,
   viruses, and the like.    Polynucleotides include, in certain aspects, regulatory sequences,
   isolated substantially away from their naturally occurring genes or protein encoding
   sequences. Polynucleotides may be RNA, DNA, analogs thereof, or a combination thereof.
   [00138]     In this respect, the term "gene," "polynucleotide," or "nucleic acid" is used to
   refer to a nucleic acid that encodes a protein, polypeptide, or peptide (including any
                                                  -43 -

  sequences required for proper transcription, post-translational modification, or localization).
  As will be understood by those in the art, this term encompasses genomic sequences,
  expression cassettes, cDNA sequences, and smaller engineered nucleic acid segments that
  express, or may be adapted to express, proteins, polypeptides, domains, peptides, fusion
 proteins, and mutants. A nucleic acid encoding all or part of a polypeptide may contain a
  contiguous nucleic acid sequence encoding all or a portion of such a polypeptide of the
 following lengths: 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 110, 120, 130, 140, 150, 160, 170,

  1060, 1070, 1080, 1090, 1095, 1100, 1500, 2000, 2500, 3000, 3500, 4000, 4500, 5000, 5500,
 6000, 6500, 7000, 7500, 8000, 9000, 10000, or more nucleotides, nucleosides, or base pairs.
 It also is contemplated that a particular polypeptide from a given species may be encoded by
 nucleic acids containing natural variations that having slightly different nucleic acid
 sequences but, nonetheless, encode the same or substantially similar protein, polypeptide, or
peptide.
 [00139]     In particular embodiments, the invention concerns isolated nucleic acid segments
and recombinant vectors incorporating nucleic acid sequences that encode an autoantigen
and/or a MHC molecule.         The term "recombinant" may be used in conjunction with a
polypeptide or the name of a specific polypeptide, and this generally refers to a polypeptide
produced from a nucleic acid molecule that has been manipulated in vitro or that is a
replication product of such a molecule.
[00140]      The nucleic acid segments used in the present invention, regardless of the length
of the coding sequence itself, may be combined with other nucleic acid sequences, such as
promoters, polyadenylation signals, additional restriction enzyme sites, multiple cloning sites,
other coding segments, and the like, such that their overall length may vary considerably. It
is therefore contemplated that a nucleic acid fragment of almost any length may be employed,
with the total length preferably being limited by the ease of preparation and use in the
intended recombinant nucleic acid protocol. In some cases, a nucleic acid sequence may
encode a polypeptide sequence with additional heterologous coding sequences, for example
                                                - 44 -

      WO 2008/109852                                                          PCT/US2008/056279
to   allow for purification    of the polypeptide, transport,       secretion, post-translational
modification, or for therapeutic benefits such as targeting or efficacy.         A tag or other
heterologous polypeptide may be added to the modified polypeptide-encoding sequence,
wherein "heterologous" refers to a polypeptide that is not the same as the modified
polypeptide.
III.     DIAGNOSTIC AND THERAPEUTIC METHODS
         A.      Immune Response and Assays
 [00141]     As discussed above, the invention concerns evoking or modifying an immune
response in a subject against an autoantigen.      In one embodiment, the resulting immune
response or condition can protect against or treat a subject having, suspected of having, or at
risk of developing a disease or symptoms related an autoimmune response.
                  1.    Immunoassays
 [00142]     The present invention includes the implementation of serological assays to
 evaluate whether and to what extent an immune response is present, induced, evoked, or
 modified by a peptide/MHC/particle complex. There are many types of immunoassays that
 can be implemented. Immunoassays encompassed by the present invention include, but are
 not limited to, those described in U.S. Patent 4,367,110 (double monoclonal antibody
 sandwich assay) and U.S. Patent 4,452,901 (western blot).                 Other assays include
 immunoprecipitation of labeled ligands and immunocytochemistry, both in vitro and in vivo.
  [00143]    One method for quantifying the number of circulating antigen-specific CD8+ T
 cells is the tetramer assay. In this assay, a specific epitope is bound to synthetic tetrameric
 forms of fluorescently labeled MHC Class I molecules. Since CD8* T cells recognize antigen
 in the form of short peptides bound to Class I molecules, cells with the appropriate T cell
 receptor will bind to the labeled tetramers and can be quantified by flow cytometry.
  Although this method is less time-consuming than an ELISPOT assay, the tetramer assay
  measures only binding, not function. Not all cells that bind a particular antigen necessarily
  become activated.     However, correlation between ELISPOT, tetramer, and cytotoxicity
  assays has been demonstrated (Goulder et al., 2000).
  [00144]     Immunoassays generally are binding assays. Certain preferred immunoassays are
  the various types of enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), radioimmunoassays
                                                - 45 -

       WO 2008/109852                                                         PCT/US2008/056279
(RIA) or bead based assays, such as Luminex@ technology, are known in the art.
Immunohistochemical detection using tissue sections is also particularly useful.
[00145]      In one example of ELISA, the antibodies or antigens are immobilized on a
selected surface, such as a well in a polystyrene microtiter plate, dipstick, or column support.
Then, a test composition suspected of containing the desired antigen or antibody, such as a
clinical sample, is added to the wells. After binding and washing to remove non specifically
bound immune complexes, the bound antigen or antibody may be detected. Detection is
 generally achieved by the addition of another antibody, specific for the desired antigen or
 antibody, that is linked to a detectable label. This type of ELISA is known as a "sandwich
 ELISA." Detection also may be achieved by the addition of a second antibody specific for
 the desired antigen, followed by the addition of a third antibody that has binding affinity for
 the second antibody, with the third antibody being linked to a detectable label. Variations on
 ELISA techniques are known to those of skill in the art.
 [00146]      Competition ELISAs are also possible in which test samples compete for binding
 with known amounts of labeled antigens or antibodies. The amount of reactive species in the
 unknown sample is determined by mixing the sample with the known labeled species before
  or during incubation with coated wells. The presence of reactive species in the sample acts to
 reduce the amount of labeled species available for binding to the well and thus reduces the
  ultimate signal.
  [00147]     Irrespective of the format employed, ELISAs have certain features in common,
  such as coating, incubating or binding, washing to remove non specifically bound species,
  and detecting the bound immune complexes.
  [00148]     Antigen or antibodies may also be linked to a solid support, such as in the form of
  plate, beads, dipstick, membrane, or column matrix, and the sample to be analyzed is applied
  to the immobilized antigen or antibody. In coating a plate with either antigen or antibody,
  one will generally incubate the wells of the plate with a solution of the antigen or antibody,
   either overnight or for a specified period. The wells of the plate will then be washed to
  remove incompletely-adsorbed material. Any remaining available surfaces of the wells are
   then "coated" with a nonspecific protein that is antigenically neutral with regard to the test
   antisera. These include bovine serum albumin (BSA), casein, and solutions of milk powder.
                                                 - 46 -

      WO 2008/109852                                                         PCT/US2008/056279
  The coating allows for blocking of nonspecific adsorption sites on the immobilizing surface
  and thus reduces the background caused by nonspecific binding of antisera onto the surface.
  [00149]     In ELISAs, it is more customary to use a secondary or tertiary detection means
  rather than a direct procedure. Thus, after binding of the antigen or antibody
                                                                                       to the well,
  coating with a non reactive material to reduce background, and washing to remove unbound
 material, the immobilizing surface is contacted with the clinical or biological sample to be
 tested under conditions effective to allow immune complex (antigen/antibody) formation.
 Detection of the immune complex then requires a labeled secondary binding ligand or
 antibody, or a secondary binding ligand or antibody in conjunction with a labeled tertiary
 antibody or third binding ligand.
          B.      Assessing an Autoimmune Response or Condition
 [00150]     In addition to the use of proteins, polypeptides, and/or peptides to treat or prevent
 an autoimmune condition, the present invention contemplates the use of these polypeptides,
 proteins, and/or peptides in a variety of ways, including the detection of the presence of
 autoantigens or an autoimmune condition to diagnose the presence of certain autoreactive cell
 populations or conditions.     In accordance with the invention, a method of detecting the
 presence of autoreactivity involves the steps of obtaining a sample from an individual, for
 example, from one's blood, saliva, tissues, bone, muscle, cartilage, or skin. Following
isolation of the sample, diagnostic assays utilizing the polypeptides, proteins, and/or peptides
of the present invention may be carried out to detect the presence of autoreactivity, and such
assay techniques for determining such in a sample are well known to those skilled in the art
and include methods such as tetramer assays, immunoassays, western blot analysis, and/or
ELISA assays.
[00151]      As used herein the phrase "immune response" or its equivalent "immunological
response" refers to the development of a cellular (mediated by antigen-specific T cells or
their secretion products) directed against an autoantigen or an related epitope of an
autoantigen.     A cellular immune response is elicited by the presentation of polypeptide
epitopes in association with Class I or Class II MHC molecules, to activate antigen-specific
CD4+ T helper cells and/or CD8+ cytotoxic T cells.             The response may also involve
activation of other components.

[00152]       For purposes of this specification and the accompanying claims the terms
"epitope" and "antigenic determinant" are used interchangeably to refer to a site on an
antigen to which B and/or T cells respond or recognize. B-cell epitopes can be formed both
from contiguous amino acids or noncontiguous amino acids juxtaposed by tertiary folding of
a protein. Epitopes formed from contiguous amino acids are typically retained on exposure
to denaturing solvents whereas epitopes formed by tertiary folding are typically lost on
treatment with denaturing solvents. An epitope typically includes at least 3, and more
usually, at least 5 or 8-10 amino acids in a unique spatial conformation.                Methods of
determining spatial conformation of epitopes include, for example, x-ray crystallography and
2-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance. See, e.g., Epitope Mapping Protocols (1996). T
cells recognize continuous epitopes of about nine amino acids for CD8 cells or about 13-15
amino acids for CD4 cells. T cells that recognize the epitope can be identified by in vitro
                                                                                       3
 assays that measure antigen-dependent proliferation, as determined by H-thymidine
 incorporation by primed T cells in response to an epitope (Burke et al., 1994), by antigen
 dependent killing (cytotoxic T lymphocyte assay, Tigges et al., 1996) or by cytokine
 secretion. The presence of a cell-mediated immunological response can be determined by
 proliferation assays (CD4+ T cells) or CTL (cytotoxic T lymphocyte) assays.
 [00153]       As used herein and in the claims, the terms "antibody" or "immunoglobulin" are
 used interchangeably and refer to any of several classes of structurally related proteins that
 function as part of the immune response of an animal or recipient, which proteins include
 IgG, IgD, IgE, IgA, IgM and related proteins.
  [00154]      Optionally, an autoantigen or preferably an epitope of an autoantigen, can be
  chemically conjugated to, or expressed as, a fusion protein with other proteins, such as MHC
  and MHC related proteins.
  [00155]      As used herein the terms "immunogenic agent" or "immunogen" or "antigen" are
  used interchangeably to describe a molecule capable of inducing an immunological response
   against itself on administration to a recipient, either alone, in conjunction with an adjuvant, or
  presented on a display vehicle.
           C.       Treatment Methods
   [00156]     A method of the present invention includes treatment for a disease or condition
   caused by one or more autoantigens. An immunogenic polypeptide of the invention can be
                                                    - 48 -

given to induce or modify an immune response in a person having, suspected of having, or at
risk of developing an autoimmune condition or disease. Methods may be employed with
respect to individuals who have tested positive for autoreactivity or who are deemed to be at
risk for developing such a condition or related condition.

  embodiments of the invention and are not meant to limit the present invention in any fashion.
  One skilled in the art will appreciate readily that the present invention is well adapted to carry
  out the objects and obtain the ends and advantages mentioned, as well as those objects, ends
  and advantages inherent herein. The present examples, along with the methods described
  herein are presently representative of preferred embodiments, are exemplary, and are not

  are encompassed within the spirit of the invention as defined by the scope of the claims will
  occur to those skilled in the art.

are tolerogenic in vivo, 8.3-TCR-transgenic NOD mice were treated (also referred to as 8.3
NOD or Vca17.4+ TCR-TG mice further below) with several i.v. injections of a small volume
of particles (5 pl, carrying 0.6 tg of NRP-V7, once every 3 days). The transgenic high
avidity IGRP 206-2 14-reactive splenic CD8+ T-cell pools of these mice were significantly
depleted in three doses (the splenic CD8:CD4 ratios dropped from ~4 to -1) (FIG. IA). The
few non-deleted CD8+ T-cells showed signs of prior activation as determined by assessing
CD44 expression (FIG. 1B) and were hyporesponsive to antigenic stimulation in vitro,
suggesting that they had been anergized by the treatment (FIG. 1C).
[00160]      To study the effectiveness of 'multiplexing', paramagnetic beads (referred herein
to as "beads," "nanoparticles," or "np" were coated with 6 different peptide/MHC monomers.
Cohorts of wild-type NOD mice were treated with a pool of these beads, with beads coated
with a control peptide (TUM)/Kd, or with beads coated with NRP-V7/Kd (it was expected
that, like NRP-V7, NRP-V7/Kd-coated beads would delete the entire IGRP 20 6-2 14-reactive
pool, without affording diabetes protection (Han et al., 2005)).       Surprisingly, unlike mice
treated with uncoated beads, avidin-biotin-coated beads (also referred herein to "biotin-np"),
TUM/Kd-coated beads or NRP-V7 peptide alone (Han et al. 2005), NOD mice treated with
NRP-V7/K-coated beads (once every 2-3 wk) were highly protected from TID (FIG. 2).
 [00161]      Systemic expansion of low-avidity clonotypes          by treatment with super
 paramagnetic nanoparticles coated with NRP-V7/K               monomers.      Studies employing
 radioactively-labeled beads indicated that their tissue distribution within 24 hours of a single
 injection was systemic, at all ages examined, as expected given their small size (FIG. 3).
 Measurements of the levels of several cytokines and chemokines in the serum of treated mice
 further indicated that np treatment did not induce a "cytokine storm" (i.e., increased serum
 levels of cytokines resulting from stimulation of diverse immune cell types, including NRP
 V7-reactive CD8+ T-cells) (FIG. 4).
  [00162]     Most interestingly, however, mice treated with NRP-V7/K -coated beads had
  significantly increased pools of circulating and intra-islet NRP-V7/K tetramer+ CD8* cells
  at the end of the follow-up period (32 wk), as compared to those of age-matched non-diabetic
  animals treated with control nanoparticles (FIG. 5A). Notably, the intra-islet CD8+ T-cells of
  the NRP-V7/Kd-nanoparticle-treated mice bound NRP-V7/Kd tetramers with significantly
  lower avidity (higher Kd) than those found in the islets of control mice, suggesting that the
  nanoparticle treatment had fostered the expansion of non-pathogenic low-avidity clonotypes

at the expense of their pathogenic high-avidity counterparts (FIG. 5B). These effects were
dose-dependent, because mice treated with lower doses were much less protected from
diabetes (FIG. 5C) and had smaller percentages of tetramer+ CD8+ T-cells in islets and
spleen (FIG. 5D, and data not shown). Furthermore, the effects of each dose appeared to be
cumulative, because mice receiving 10 consecutive doses of nanoparticles (two/week starting
at 10 weeks of age) had significantly higher percentages of circulating tetramer+ CD8+ T
cells than those receiving only 4 doses (also starting at 10 weeks of age; FIG. 5E).
[00163]       The above results suggested that the NRP-V7/K/Kd-coated np were specifically
recognized and uptaken by NRP-V7-reactive CD8+ T-cells (via their TCR). To investigate
this, the inventors assessed the presence of green fluorescence (bound to the avidin molecule
of the peptide-MHC np complex) in different splenocyte subpopulations of NOD mice
expressing a transgenic NRP-V7-reactive TCR as well as in wild-type, non-transgenic NOD
mice. Within 24-40 hours of NRP-V7/Kd np injection, green fluorescence could only be
detected in the CD8+ T-cell subset of TCR-transgenic mice (FIG. 6A) and, to a much lesser
extent, in the CD8+ T-cell subset of non-transgenic mice (FIG. 6B). No detectable
 accumulation of green fluorescence could be detected in the splenic CD4+ T, B, CD1 1b+, or
 CD 11c+ cell subsets of either type of mice (FIGS. 6A and 6B).
 [00164]      Anti-diabetogenic properties of super-paramagnetic nanoparticles coated
 with a subdominant autoantigenic peptide/MHC (DMK 138..146/D b) complex.                  The
 inventors investigated whether the protective effects of the above therapeutic avenue were a
 peculiarity of NRP-V7-reactive CD8+ T-cells (a prevalent autoreactive T-cell subset in NOD
 mice), or a phenomenon applicable to other, less dominant autoantigenic specificities. To
 this end, mice were treated with beads coated with a peptide that is derived from another
  autoantigen that is presented by Db and is targeted by a much smaller pool of diabetogenic
  autoreactive CD8+ T-cells (residues 138-146 of Dystrophia Myotonica Kinase; DMK; herein
 referred to as "DMK138-146/Db",) (Lieberman et al., 2004). As was the case with nanoparticles
  coated with NRP-V7/K       complexes, treatment of NOD mice with DMK138-146/Db-coated
  nanoparticles caused significant expansions of circulating, splenic and intra-islet DMK     38
  146 /Db-reactive CD8+ T cells (FIG. 7A) and afforded significant diabetes protection (FIG.
  7B).      T cell expansion in vivo was antigen-specific because DMK138-146/Db-coated
  nanoparticles did not expand NRP-V7-reactive CD8+ T cells (FIG. 7C) and NRP-V7/K

  [00165]    Impaired recruitment of other IGRP-autoreactive CD8+ T-cell specificities to
 islets in mice treated with NRP-V7/Kd- or DMKi 38-146 /Db-coated nanoparticles.                Next the
 inventors investigated whether recruitment of nanoparticle-expanded low-avidity NRP-V7
 and/or DMK138 -i46 /Db-reactive CD8+ T cells impaired the recruitment of other beta cell
 autoreactive T cell specificities to islets, as was the case in APL-treated animals (Han et al.
 2005). This was done by comparing responsiveness of islet-associated CD8+ T cells of mice
 treated with control, NRP-V7/Kd- or DMK 13 8- 146 /Db-coated nanoparticles to a panel of 76
 different IGRP epitopes as well as DMK 138-146.           As expected, given that they contained
 increased frequencies of NRP-V7- or DMK         38 -146 /Db-reactive clonotypes, the islet-associated
 CD8+     T  cells of mice treated with NRP-V7/K d-coated                and DMK 138 -146 /D -coated
 nanoparticles produced significantly more IFN-y in response to NRP-V7 and DMK

 respectively, than those isolated from control mice (FIG. 8). Notably, there were significant
reductions in the number of epitopes capable of eliciting significant IFN-y responses by the
islet-associated CD8+ T cells of mice treated with NRP-V7/Kd or DMK                   38 -146 /Db-coated
nanoparticles, as compared to those from mice treated with control nanoparticles, suggesting
impaired recruitment and/or accumulation (Table 3).

pre-diabetic stage prompted investigation into the ability of nanoparticle therapy to restore
normoglycemia in newly diagnosed diabetic mice. Cohorts of mice were monitored twice a
week for blood glucose levels and considered hyperglycemic at >10.5 mM blood glucose.

   coated nanoparticles (two weekly injections). Half a unit of subcutaneous insulin was also
  given once daily to mice displaying glycosuria, to reduce beta cell stress and foster beta cell
  regeneration. Additional cohorts of mice received DMK138 -14 6/Db-coated nanoparticles.
  Treatment with monoclonal anti-CD3 antibody (20 tg/d for 5 days), which has been shown
  to induce stable remission in a variable percentage of animals in different studies, was used as
  positive control. As shown in FIGS. 9A and 9B, 9 of 11 mice treated with NRP-V7/Kd_
  coated particles became normoglycemic within 5-12 weeks of treatment. The two mice that
  did not cure were the only two which received the first dose of treatment when their blood
  glucose levels were >18 mM/l, suggesting that effectiveness may require the presence of a
  critical mass of residual beta cells. Likewise, 8 of 11 mice treated with DMK 38 - /Db-coated
                                                                                     146
 nanoparticles became normoglycemic (FIGS. 9A and 9C), with the other three displaying
 oscillating levels of blood glucose that did not reach 20 mM for an extended period of time
 (FIG. 9C). In contrast, only 1 of 9 mice receiving control TUM/Kd-coated nanoparticles did
 not progress to overt hyperglycemia (FIGS. 9A and 9D). FIG. 9E compares the average
 levels of blood glucose in each group of mice after each injection of nanoparticles. FIG. 9F
 shows the results of treatment with anti-CD3 mAb, a non-antigen-specific
 immunotherapeutic strategy that has been previously shown to also be able to restore
 normoglycemia in acutely diabetic mice (positive control group); 4 of 6 mice became
normoglycemic. When taken together, these results suggest that effectiveness of antigen
 specific nanoparticle therapy approach is comparable to that of a non-antigen-specific
approach that has proven successful in mice and, more recently, human diabetic patients
(Keymeulen et al., 2005; Herold et al., 2002).
[00167]      To investigate whether the effects of treatment in diabetic mice were long-lasting,
as seen in pre-diabetic animals, treatment was withdrawn after 4 consecutive weeks of
normoglycemia and followed the mice for diabetes recurrence. The effects of treatment on
the size of the circulating tetramer-positive pool were assessed at treatment withdrawal, 4
weeks later and at the time of recurrent hyperglycemia. There was a decline in the size of the
circulating tetramer-reactive T cell pool 4 weeks after cessation of treatment, as expected
(FIG. 10A), and, presumably as a result, ~30-45% of the diabetic mice that had been cured
developed recurrent hyperglycemia between 4 and 14 weeks later (FIGS. lOB and 1OC). This
suggested that re-activation of the expanded low-avidity autoreactive T-cell pool, either by
endogenous autoantigen (i.e., in pre-diabetic animals) or by booster injections of
nanoparticles (i.e., in diabetic animals with a severely reduced beta cell mass) may be

required for long-term protection. Similar results were obtained in mice that had been treated
with DMK13 8-146 /Db-coated nanoparticles (FIGS. 10A, 1OB, and 10D).
[00168]      Intraperitoneal glucose tolerance tests (IPGTTs) in cured versus diabetic and non
diabetic untreated mice comfirmed that the former had glucose tolerance curves nearly
identical to those displayed by non-diabetic untreated animals and significantly better than
those corresponding to diabetic mice (FIG. 11 A).         Furthermore, the cured animals had
postprandial serum insulin levels that were statistically comparable to those seen in non
diabetic untreated mice and significantly higher than those corresponding to diabetic
untreated animals (FIG. 11 B). In agreement with these data, the IPGTT serum insulin levels
of NRP-V7/Kd-np and DMK138-146/Db-np-treated mice were similar to those of non-diabetic
mice and significantly better than those of diabetic untreated animals (FIG. I 1C). The cured
 animals had normal body weights at 50 weeks of age (>25 weeks after reversal of
hyperglycemia), as compared to those of age-matched non-diabetic untreated mice (FIG.
 11D).
 [00169]      Peptide/MHC-coated nanoparticles can effectively 'discriminate' between
 high- and low-avidity autoreactive CD8+ T-cells.         Most IGRP 206-214 -reactive CD8+ cells
 employ CDR3-invariant Va17-Ja42 chains but heterogeneous VDJP chains.                   'Avidity
 maturation' of this T cell subset during diabetogenesis is associated with changes in usage of
 3 different Va17 elements. That these 3 different Va elements afford differences in ligand
 binding avidity (Va17.5>Va17.4> Va17.6) was confirmed in studies of TCRc@
 transfectants expressing the 3 different CDR3-invariant Va1 7-Ja42 chains in the context of a
 single TCRp chain (Han et al., 2005).            To investigate whether peptide/MHC-coated
 nanoparticles could in fact differentially target T cells recognizing ligand with different
 avidity, the ability of NRP-V7/Kd-coated nanoparticles to induce 'capping' of CD8
 molecules on these transfectants was assessed. More than 60% of Va17.5+ cells, but less
 than 20% Va17.4+ or Va17.6+ cells, had formed caps by 5 min of incubation with NRP
 V7/Kd-coated beads. By 30 min, the percentage of Val7.4+ cells with caps approached that
  seen for Val7.5+ cells, but this number remained lower than 20% for Vc17.6+ cells (FIG.
  12).   These results demonstrate that NRP-V7/Kd-coated beads can in fact discriminate
  between high and low-avidity T cell and provide an explanation as to why these nanoparticles
  preferentially delete naive high avidity clonotypes. However, they do not explain why these
  particles expand low avidity clonotypes, particularly if it is assumed that TCR ligation in the

absence of costimulation (by peptide/MHC on nanoparticles) would also be expected to
delete, rather than expand, low-avidity clonotypes.
[00170]      CD8'     cells  expressing    the low-affinity   Va17.6/8.3p      TCR are anti
diabetogenic.     To investigate whether low-avidity autoreactive CD8+ T-cells have anti
diabetogenic properties in vivo, the low affinity IGRP 206-214-reactive Va17.6/8.3p TCR were
transgenically expressed in NOD mice (referred herein to as 'VaX17.6+'; which as a -10-fold
lower affinity than the 8.3-TCR (Val7.4+); Teyton and Santamaria, unpublished data). It
has been shown that this TCR fosters positive selection of CD8+ cells, but clearly less than
the 8.3-TCR (Vu17.4*) (Han et al., 2005). As a result, Val7.6* TCR-TG mice contain fewer
NRP-V7 tetramer-reactive CD8' thymocytes and splenocytes than Va17.4* TCR-TG mice.
Furthermore, the tetramer+ (high and low) CD8* cells from Val7.6* TCR-TG mice secrete
less IFN-y (and IL-2) than those derived from V017.4+ TCR-TG mice upon peptide
stimulation in vitro, and are inefficient killers of NRP-V7-pulsed RMA-SKd targets,
compatible with their low avidity for ligand (Han et al., 2005; and data not shown). Most
importantly, these mice are almost completely protected from diabetes (only 2 of 70 females
have developed TID) and insulitis [scores of <0.4 vs >3 (out of a maximum of 4) in Vc17.6*
vs. Vca17.4+ TCR-TG mice, respectively (P<0.012)] (FIG. 13A and FIG. 13B).
[00171]      This is in stark contrast to what occurs in NOD mice expressing an irrelevant non
autoreactive TCR that recognizes a LCMV epitope (LCMV TCR-TG NOD mice).                       As
reported previously by Serreze et al. (2001), and confirmed by use herein, these mice develop
TlD essentially like wild-type NOD mice and recruit endogenous IGRP 206-214-reactive CD8'
cells to islets (completely absent in the islets of Va7.6* TCR-TG mice) (FIG. 13C). Thus,
unlike the Val17.4* and LCMV TCRs (pro-diabetogenic and neutral, respectively), the
Vc17.6* TCR appears to have anti-diabetogenic properties.
 [00172]     Notwithstanding the fact that most TG T cells of these Va17.6* TCR-TG mice
bind tetramers weakly or not at all, a fraction of the cells that exit the thymus binds tetramer
 with apparent high avidity (i.e., with high mfi) (FIG. 14A). The inventors suspected that the
 tetramer-low (lo) and tetramer-negative CD8+ T cells of these mice originate from
 CD4+CD8+ thymocytes that express the TG TCR but undergo positive selection on
 endogenous TCRs (i.e., TCRa chains). The tetramer-hi cells, on the other hand, would
 originate from CD4+CD8+ thymocytes that only express the TG TCRa chains and, because

of their low affinity for peptide/MHC, can only undergo positive selection if they express
higher levels of the TG TCR than normal. This interpretation is supported by the observation
that, in mice expressing the Va17.6* TCR in a RAG-2-1 background, the only cells that
mature are those binding tetramer with high avidity (FIG. 14B). Importantly, these two types
of RAG-2^     TCR-TG mice develop diabetes with similar incidence (FIG. 15). Thus, the
inventors suspect that the tetramer-lo and tetramer-CD8+ T cells that mature in RAG-2+
Va17.6 TCR-TG mice inhibit the diabetogenic potential of their tetramer-hi counterparts
(which cause diabetes in RAG- TCR-TG mice). These results were reproduced in stocks of
Va 17.6 TCR-TG mice carrying an endogenous TCR-Ca deficiency that recludes expression
of endogenous (i.e., non-transgenic) TCRa chains (FIGS. 16A and 16B).
[00173]      Va17.6+ (but not Vc17.4+) TCR-TG mice spontaneously generate a pool of
memory CD8+ cells with immunosuppressive activities. Cytofluorometric studies of the
tetramer-positive CD8' T-cells contained in the different lymphoid organs of Va17.6+ TCR
TG mice and TCR-Ca-deficient Va17.6 TCR-TG mice revealed the presence of enlarged
pools of CD44hi and CD44hiCD122+ CD8+ cells as compared to Vc17.4+ TCR-TG mice in
the spleen, lymph nodes and, especially, the bone marrow, a known reservoir of memory T
cells (FIGS. 17A and 17B).      Importantly, this occurs primarily within the tetramer-low, but
not in the tetramer-high subset, which does not contain CD122* cells (FIG. 17C). These cells
 express markers described on both central and effector memory lymhocytes (FIG. 17D), are
 and predominantly found in the peripheral lymphoid organs but not thymus, suggesting a
peripheral origin (FIG. 17E).     Furthermore, BrdU incorporation assays suggested that they
proliferate in vivo (FIG. 17F).     Functionally, these memory-like cells clearly behave as
 'memory' T-cells, as purified splenic Vc17.6* (but not Vca17.4*) TCR-TG CD8* cells
 proliferate vigorously in response to IL-2 or IL-15 in the absence of APCs and antigen (FIG.
 17G). Furthermore, they rapidly produce IFN-gamma upon stimulation with antigen in vitro
 (FIGS. 17H and 171).       However, they neither proliferate nor produce interleukin-2 upon
 antigenic stimulation in vitro (FIG. 17J). This functional profile is highly reminiscent of that
 of the regulatory (suppressive) CD4+CD25+ T cell subset. Altogether, these data suggest
 that Va17.6* (but not Vcal7.4*) TCR-TG CD8+ cells have an increased ability to become
 long-lived memory T cells (upon one or more antigen encounters), presumably capable of
 surviving indefinitely in response to homeostatic cues, even in the absence of antigen.

[00174]      These observations led the inventors to suspect that the superior homeostatic
'fitness' of these memory low-avidity T cells, otherwise unable to kill beta cells, contributes
to their anti-diabetogenic activity (i.e., by affording a competitive advantage over their
higher-avidity, but mostly naive, beta cell killer clonotypes, and/or by inhibiting their
activation). To assess the latter, the ability of purified CD122* and CD122-Val7.6* TCR
TG CD8* T cells were assessed for their ability to inhibit the proliferation of CFSE-labeled
splenic CD8' T cells from Va17.4+ TCR-TG NOD mice. As shown in FIG. 18, CD122* (but
not CD 122-) Va17.6* TCR-TG CD8+ T cells almost completely inhibited the proliferation of
their higher avidity naive T cell counterparts.
[00175]      Consistent with the idea that the spontaneously expanded pool of memory
(CD122*) low-avidity autoreactive CD8* T cells in Va17.6+ TCR-TG NOD mice is anti
diabetogenic, systemic (i.v.) treatment of Va17.6+ and Va17.4* TCR-TG mice with NRP
V7-pulsed DCs, an agonistic mAb against CD40, or an agonistic mAb against 4-1BB (to
enhance CD8* T cell activation/survival), induced rapid onset of diabetes in Va17.4k TCR
TG NOD mice, but were unable to elicit disease in Va17.6+ TCR-TG mice (Table 4).

non-cognate diabetogenic T cell responses (i.e., directed against autoantigenic peptides other
than the target autoantigenic peptide of these suppressive T-cells - IGRP 2 06-2 14        -), led the
inventors to suspect that they might effect their suppressive activity by targeting antigen

CD8+ T cells as effectors indicated that the former, but not the latter were able to specifically
lyse NRP-V7-pulsed DCs in vitro (FIG. 19A). The inventors confirmed that this was also
true in vivo. They transfused equal numbers of NRP-V7-pulsed and TUM-pulsed B-cells
(labeled with low or high concentrations of the dye CFSE, respectively) into VUa17.6+ TCR
TG and Vc17.4* TCR-TG mice and a day later sacrificed the hosts to investigate which cells
had survived the transfer. As shown in FIG. 19B, whereas NRP-V7-pulsed B-cells only
survived in Vc17.4* TCR-TG mice, B-cells pulsed wth the negative control peptide TUM
survived in both TCR-TG strains. Virtually identical results were obtained when DCsm
rather than B-cells, were used as APCs (FIG. 19B). These data suggest that low-avidity
CD122* Vca17.6+ TCR-TG CD8* T cells suppress cognate and non-cognate diabetogenic T
cell responses by killing autoantigen-loaded APCs.
[00177]      NRP-V7/Kd-coated      nanoparticles induce the expansion of low avidity
(tetramer-intermediate) memory autoreactive CD8* cells in wild-type NOD mice. The
above observations in Vcal7.6* TCR-TG NOD mice were highly reminiscent of what was
seen in NOD mice treated with peptide/MHC-coated nanoparticles: disappearance of high
avidity clonotypes, and expansion and recruitment of low-avidity CD8+ T cells, impaired
recruitment of other IGRP epitope-reactive specificities to islets, and protection from
diabetes.
 [00178]     To assess whether the bead-expanded CD8' T cells in wild-type NOD mice were
long-lived low avidity memory T cells, the inventors analyzed the presence of memory
markers (CD44 and CD122) in the NRP-V7/Kd tetramer-positive CD8+ T-cells contained in
the spleen and bone marrow of mice treated with NRP-V7/K-coated nanoparticles.               The
 expanded populations of tetramer-positive cells contained in the spleen and marrow of these
mice contained increased percentages of CD44hi and CD44hiCD122+ CD8+ T-cells,
particularly in the bone marrow (FIG. 20A), confirming that NRP-V7/Kd nanoparticle
 treatment increases the size of the tetramer+CD44hi and tetramer+CD44hiCD122+ T cell
 pools.
 [00179]     Functionally, the memory-like T-cells that are expanded by in vivo therapy with
 NRP-V7/Kd-coated nanoparticles behave like the memory CD122* Va17.6+ TCR-TG CD8*
 T cells that spontaneously accumulate in Va17.6+ TCR-TG mice: they neither produce IL-2
 nor proliferate, yet produce high levels of IFN-gamma in response to antigenic stimulation in
                                                - 63 -

      WO 2008/109852                                                          PCT/US2008/056279
vitro (FIG. 20B). Most importantly, upon activation with anti-CD3 mAb and IL-2, these
memory-like T-cells efficiently suppressed the proliferation of CFSE-labeled responder
Va17.4* TCR-TG CD8           T-cells in vitro (FIG. 20C).  Suppression was not simply due to
competition for peptide, because CFSE-labeled responder Val7.4+ TCR-TG CD8                T-cells
also failed to proliferate in the presence of memory-like T-cells expanded by treatment with
DMK 138-146/Db-coated nanoparticles (FIG. 20D).
[00180]        Peptide/MHC-coated nanoparticles expand pre-existing low-avidity memory
T cells. Several observations suggest that peptide/MHC-coated nanoparticles do not generate
memory T-cells de novo, but rather expand pre-existing pools of memory T cells: (i)
treatment of NOD mice with TUM/K -coated nanoparticles did not induce systemic
expansion of TUM-reactive CD8+            T cells (recognizing a tumor-specific antigen, not
expressed in NOD mice; FIG. 21A); (ii) Treatment of BO.H2g7 mice, which develop neither
diabetes nor insulitis, with NRP-V7/Kd-coated nanoparticles failed to induce a significant
expansion of the NRP-V7/K tetramer+ CD8+ T-cell subset in all lymphoid organs examined
(FIG. 21B); (iii) Systemic expansion of tetramer-reactive CDs+ T-cells in nanoparticle
treated NOD mice was significantly more effective when initiated at diabetes onset than in
the pre-diabetic stage (FIG. 21C); and (iv) unlike naive CDs+ T cells, which tend to undergo
apoptosis upon TCR ligation in the absence of costimulation, memory CD8+ T cells are
 costimulation-independent for growth.
 [00181]       To investigate the above hypothesis formally, the inventors asked whether
 IGRP 206 -2 14/K -coated nanoparticles could expand IGRP 206 -2 14/K -reactive CD8+ T-cells in a
 gene-targeted NOD strain that expresses a mutant form of IGRP in which the two TCR
 contact residues of IGRP 206-2 14 have been replaced with alanines (K209A and F213A) (FIG.
 22A). The targeted alleles (herein referred to as FLEXI or NOD.IGRPK209A/ F2 13AKl/KI) were
 backcrossed onto the NOD background (from 129) using the speed-congenic approach, to
 ensure homozygosity for NOD alleles at all Idd loci. Because the CD8+ T-cells that mature
 in these gene-targeted mice are never exposed to IGRP 206-2 14 in vivo, these mice cannot
 spontaneously generate memory IGRP 206-2 14/Kd-reactive CD8+ T-cells. Despite the fact that
 these mice develop both diabetes and insulitis (not shown), their islet-associated CD8+ T
  cells recognize epitopes in IGRP, but are completely devoid of IGRP 206-2 14-reactive CD8+
  clonotypes. Most importantly, FLEX 1-homozygous NOD mice treated with optimal doses of
  IGRP 206- 2 14/K -coated particles did not contain expanded pools of IGRP 206-21 4/Kd-reactive
                                                  -64 -

CD8+ T-cells in their lymphoid organs (FIG. 22B). These data provide formal proof that
peptide/MHC-coated nanoparticles expand pre-existing pools of memory T-cells with
suppressive properties and cannot generate memory T-cells de novo.
[00182]     Since low-avidity clonotypes (i.e., in Va17.6* TCR-TG mice) appear to be more
efficient at generating memory T-cell progeny than their high-avidity counterparts (i.e., in
Val7.4k TCR-TG mice) during diabetogenesis, it was concluded that peptide/MHC-coated
particles work by inducing the deletion of naive high-avidity clonotypes and the expansion of
small pools of pre-existing memory low-avidity clonotypes.

  TESTING THE ABILITY OF IRON OXIDE NANOPARTICLES COATED WITH
     HUMAN TYPE 1 DIABETES-RELEVANT PEPTIDE/HLA COMPLEXES TO
                             RESTORE NORMOGLYCEMIA
[00183]     "Humanized" mice expressing HLA transgenes and peptide/HLA complexes
available for the proposed studies. As mentioned above, peptides derived from insulin and
IGRP are primary targets of CD8* T cells in wild-type NOD mice. Assessment of human
MHC molecules (Human Leukocyte Antigens, HLA) presented peptides derived from these
two autoantigens during diabetogenesis is being investigated in 'humanized' HLA-transgenic
NOD mice. Studies focused initially on HLAA*0201, a MHC molecule that is expressed by
nearly 50%     of certain ethnic groups.        This study employs     the strain designated
NOD.s2m"ul.HHD, which lacks the murine P2 macroglobulin gene and expresses the
chimeric monochain construct HHD (Pascolo et al., 1997). This construct encodes human
p~2m covalently linked to the al and a2 domains of human HLA-A*0201, and the a3,
transmembrane, and cytoplasmic domains of murine H-2D . Though the strain expresses
only HLA-A*0201,       and not endogenous murine class I MHC molecules, it is diabetes
susceptible, with 55% of females affected by 30 weeks of age (Takaki et al., 2006). Two
epitopes of human IGRP (hIGRP 228 -23 6 and hIGRP265 -273 ) that bind to HLA-A*0201 are
recognized by islet-associated CD8' T cells of these mice and CD8+ T cells isolated from the
islets of NOD.p2mnun.HHD mice are cytotoxic to human HLA-A*0201-positive                islets
(Takaki et al., 2006).     Peptide/HLA-A*0201 tetramers were made using one of these
peptides. To facilitate binding of these tetramers by murine CD8 molecules, the a3 (CD8
binding) domain of the HLA-A*0201 complex was replaced with that of the murine H-2Kb
molecule.    Results from these studies have established the utility of these mice for the
                                                -65 -

identification of HLA-A*0201-restricted T cells and beta cell autoantigens of potential
relevance to human TID (Takaki et al. 2006).           Based on the current disclosure, one can
identify the human peptides that are targeted by HLA-A*0201-restricted T cells from TID
patients.    In addition, the inventors have generated NOD mice expressing HLA-A*1101,
HLA-B*0702, or HLA-Cw*0304. These mice also have murine p2m replaced with human
p2m by crossing them with the NOD.32mn1u.h 32m strain (Hamilton-Williams et al., 2001).
All three HLA transgenes express well, and all three of the HLA-transgenic strains are
diabetes-susceptible.      Taken together      HLAs from these        "humanized"     animals    are
representative of the four different HLA supertypes HLA-A2, HLA-A3, HLA-B7, and HLA
Cl, respectively (Sidney et al., 1996; Doytchinova et al., 2004).         The gene frequencies of
HLA-A*1 101, HLA-B*0702, or HLA-Cw*0304 alleles can be as high as 23%, 11%, or 10%,
respectively, depending on the ethnic group examined (Cao et al., 2001). Coverage of the
population can be over 90%, depending on the ethnic group considered, when all four
 supertypes are targeted (Sidney et al., 1996; Doytchinova et al., 2004; Cao et al., 2001). This
 consideration is significant in regard to translation of these studies to humans. These animals
 as well as the previously described NOD.p2m ".HHD strain are available for further studies.
 [00184]      In this Example the inventors propose a design on how to translate these
 observations in wild-type NOD mice to 'humanized'            HLA-transgenic NOD mice.          The
 objective is to investigate if treatment with nanoparticles coated with several different
 peptide/HLA complexes targeting pools of autoreactive CD8+ T cells relevant to human TID
 can protect the mice from diabetes as well as restore normoglycemia in their newly
 diagnosed counterparts.     The inventors have shown that repeated treatment of NOD mice
 with small doses of nanoparticles coated with H-2Kd or H-2Db molecules presenting epitopes
 targeted by prevalent and non-prevalent autoreactive CD8+ T cell specificities, respectively,
 induced peptide-specific expansion of memory low-avidity autoreactive CD8* T cells that
 were capable of preventing TID development in wild-type NOD mice and of restoring
 normoglycemia in newly diagnosed diabetic NOD mice.                Here the inventors present a
  translational approach to identify TiD-relevant peptide/HLA combinations for use in human
  T1D. Specifically, the inventors contemplate that nanoparticles coated with different TiD
  relevant autoantigenic peptide/HLA-A*0201 complexes will afford diabetes protection and
  cure TID in NOD.p2m""".HHD mice (expressing HLA-A*0201).               One of skill in the art can
  use this disclosure for use with other epitopes related to other autoimmune diseases, using
  compositions and methods similar to those used with insulin and/or IGRP epitopes presented

cells, to include other compositions and methods. One of skill will be able to identify the
minimal treatment conditions and the type of peptide/HLA complexes that will afford
maximum therapeutic benefits, as well as the requirement for pre-therapeutic existence of
memory low-avidity CD8* T cells for therapeutic success and identification of additional
peptide/HLA combinations covering as many individuals in different ethnic groups as
possible.
[00185]     Nanoparticle synthesis. Nanoparticles are synthesized and characterized at the
physical and chemical levels essentially as described previously (Moore et al., 2004), but
using biotinylated peptide/HLA-A*0201 monomers. The MHC molecule of the complex is
composed of human P2 microglobulin and a chimeric form of human HLA-A*0201 in which
its al and a2 domains are fused to the a3 domain of murine H-2Kb (to facilitate recognition
by the murine CD8 molecule). As autoantigenic peptides several different insulin and IGRP
derivatives (such as, for example, hInsBIo-Is, hIGRP 228 -2 36 and hIGRP2 65 -27 3 ) are used that
have been shown to be recognized by islet-associated CD8+ T cells in the context of HLA
A*0201. Biotinylated peptide/HLA-A*0201 monomers are added at a molar ratio of 4 moles
of biotin per mole of avidin. Biotinylated proteins are added in multiple portions (about 0.4
moles biotin per avidin) over a period of 24 hours at 4'C with slow stirring (10 rpm). The
resultant probes are purified on a magnetic separation column (Milteny Biotec). A monomer
consisted of an unrelated HLA-A*0201-binding peptide complexed with HLA-A*0201
molecules are used for the synthesis of negative control probe. Nanoparticle size, relaxivity
(change in relaxation rate per mM), number of biotin binding sites, and iron and protein
content are measured.
[00186]     Administration of nanoparticles. Cohorts of 10-15 female NOD.p2m"'.HHD
mice are treated with nanoparticles coated with each of the different peptide/HLA complexes
referred to above or a negative control peptide (influenza)/HLA complex (0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5
and 1 tg peptide equivalents, one dose every 3 wk from 4 to 30 wk of age, or two doses/week
starting at 10 weeks of age for 5 consecutive weeks).         Peripheral expansion of antigen
specific CD8+ T cells are documented by staining blood mononuclear cells with anti-CD8
mAb and peptide/MHC tetramers (before initiation of treatment and at treatment withdrawal).
Mice are killed at the onset of hyperglycemia or at the end of the study. Individual mice are
studied by multicolor flow cytometry for presence of central and/or effector memory (CD69~,

organs (spleen, lymph nodes), bone marrow (a known reservoir of memory T cells), liver,
lung and islets. Tetramer-binding avidity is measured as described (Han et al., 2005; Amrani
et al., 2000). The inventors contemplate that treatment induces systemic expansion of low
avidity central and effector memory tetramer+ CD8+ cells and preferential (but not exclusive)
accumulation of these T cells in marrow, pancreatic lymph nodes (PLNs) and islets.
[00187]      Administration of multiple doses of peptide/MHC complex. In another study,
cohorts of mice are treated with one, two, three or four injections of an effective dose, which
the inventors contemplate to be similar for all those complexes exhibiting therapeutic efficacy
in other studies (at 4, 7, 10 and 13 wk). It is expected that protection will require one or more
than one dose (to expand the memory low-avidity T cell pool above the protective threshold)
and that the expanded tetramer+ CD8+ memory T cell population progressively disappears
from the circulation to accumulate in marrow, PLNs, and islets.
[00188]      Administration of peptide/MHC complexes at the onset of hyperglycemia.
Mice are treated at the onset of hyperglycemia (>10.5 mM/l) with a more aggressive
nanoparticle treatment protocol (1-5     tg peptide equivalents twice a wk for 5 wk). Negative
and positive controls will receive nanoparticles coated with an irrelevant peptide/HLA
complex or anti-CD3 mAb (a daily i.v. injection of 20            tg for 5 days (Haller, 2005)),
respectively. Mice are bled immediately before the initiation of treatment to assess baseline
percentages of tetramer-positive CD8* T cells in the circulation. Reversal of TlD will be
considered when blood glucose values stabilize at <10 mM/l for at least 4 weeks at which
time treatment with be withdrawn. Mice are bled again to confirm presence of significantly
expanded pools of circulating tetramer-positive CD8+ T cells. The animals are followed for
 at least an additional 8-12 weeks to ensure stable remission. Mice are sacrificed at the end of
the observation period to establish the long-term persistence of the expanded pools of
memory tetramer-positive CD8* T cells in different lymphoid and non-lymphoid organs.
 Pancreas tissue will also be harvested for histological analysis. It is expected that long-term
remission will be associated with the presence of numerous small islets devoid of
 mononuclear cell infiltration.    That is, unlike the situation in pre-diabetic mice where the
 treatment is expected to foster occupation of inflamed islets by protective memory T cells,
 treatments in diabetic mice is predicted to promote accumulation of the protective memory T

cells in the pancreatic lymph nodes (in addition to other reservoirs of memory T cells), but
not in islets (presumably newborn islets lacking inflammatory potential).
[00189]      Peptide/HLA-coated particles work by inducing the deletion of naive high
avidity clonotypes. The inventors contemplate that low avidity autoreactive CD8* T cells
tend to accumulate as memory cells during TiD progression (in small numbers) and that
peptide/HLA-coated particles work by inducing the deletion of naive high-avidity clonotypes
(owing to TCR triggering without costimulation) and the expansion of small pools of pre
existing memory low-avidity clonotypes (costimulation-independent).             In part, this stems
from the observation that treatment of mice with an irrelevant peptide (from a tumor
antigenic, (TUM/H-2K") complex did not induce the peripheral expansion of TUM/Kd
tetramer-reactive CD8* T cells above background (see above). These memory low-avidity
autoreactive CD8* cells then inhibit the activation of their naive high-avidity (presumably
less-fitter) counterparts by competing for stimulatory resources (i.e., antigen/MHC on DCs,
cytokines, etc.). In fact, there is evidence in other systems that memory cells can compete
effectively with naYve T cells for homeostatic cues (i.e., IL- 15) (Tan et al., 2002). By making
stable contacts with autoantigen-loaded DCs in the PLNs, these prevalent memory low
avidity clonotypes would also inhibit the activation of other autoreactive T cell specificities.
 [00190]     Manifestation of the T cell expansion (and anti-diabetogenic activity) of
peptide/HLA-coated        nanoparticles requires expression of the endogenous target
 autoantigen in beta cells. The expression of endogenous target autoantigens are believed to
be the source of the stimulus that induces the formation of the memory low avidity
 autoreactive CD8* T cell pools that are subsequently expanded by the nanoparticle treatment.
An IGRP deficiency will be introduced into NOD.p2m".HHD mice. These mice are treated
with hIGRP 228 -236 (cross-reactive with mIGRP 228 -236 ) and hIGRP265 -273 (identical to mIGRP 265
 273)/HLA-A*0201-coated      nanoparticles (Takaki et al., 2006).     Two ES clones carrying a
 conditional IGRP allele are available to the inventors and are currently undergoing removal
 of a neomycin cassette by transient transfection of Cre, prior to generating germline
 competent chimeras. The targeted alleles will be backcrossed to NOD.p2mnun.HHD mice
 (from the 129 strain) using the speed-congenic approach, to ensure homozygosity for NOD
 alleles at all Idd loci.   The resulting NOD.p2m""".IGRP           .HHD mice are treated with
 optimal doses of nanoparticles coated with the two IGRP/HLA complexes. The inventors

contemplate that the treatment will not induce the expansion/recruitment of the corresponding
hIGRP peptide/HLA-reactive CD8+ cells.
[00191]     If IGRP expression is dispensable for diabetes development (it is known that lack
of IGRP expression is not lethal, as rats do not express it) and the mice spontaneously
develop diabetes, it is also predicted that the nanoparticle treatment will not protect the mice
from T1D (there will be no memory IGRP-reactive CD8+ T cells). In contrast, treatment with
particles coated with complexes of HLA-A*0201 and insulin epitopes will induce expansion
of the corresponding memory T cell pools and will be protective, as the mice will continue to
express insulin.
[00192]     It is possible that the nanoparticle types to be tested here will not induce
significant T cell expansions in all the mice.         This will likely depend on whether the
corresponding T cell population has previously undergone priming in vivo prior to the
initiation of treatment. It may be useful/necessary to study additional cohorts of mice treated
with combinations of several different nanoparticle types. Obviously, it is conceivable that,
contrary to our prediction, nanoparticle treatment might be able to induce the de novo
formation of memory low-avidity T cell pools.             In this case, however, the inventors
contemplate that these cells will not be protective because they will not be able to engage
endogenous IGRP/HLA-A*0201 complexes on DCs in treated NOD.32m" .IGRPnu .HHD
mice.
[00193]     hIGRP expressing mice. The inventors have generated several lines of mice
expressing a rat insulin promoter-driven human IGRP transgene and have compared the
levels of expression of the human transgene in each of these lines to that of the endogenous
mIGRP-encoding locus by real-time RT-PCR.             Although the levels of expression of the
transgene were highly variable from line to line, the levels of expression were consistent
among different individuals within individual lines. In one of these lines (#1114) the levels
of expression of hIGRP were equivalent to those of mIGRP.
