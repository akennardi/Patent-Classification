                                          ABSTRACT
   A projectile 14 for an ammunition round 10 for use with a small arms or light firearm
   comprises an elongated projectile body 16. The projectile body 16 has first and
 5 second axially opposed ends 18, 20 respectively and a cavity 20 extending there
   between. The cavity is able to hold a quantity of propellant 24. A plurality of seals 26
   extend about an outer surface of the bodyl6. The seals 26 protrude radially from the
   body 16 and operate to form a substantial seal against an inner circumferential surface
   of a barrel 12 of the firearm. Two of the seals 26b and 26c are mutually adjacent and
10 spaced apart in a direction of a longitudinal axis of the body to form a seal bound outer
   surface portion 36 of the body 16. One or more holes 38 are formed in the body 16
   enabling fluid communication between the cavity 22 and the seal bound outer surface
   portion 36 of the body 16. This enables pressure equalisation inside and outside of the
   cavity 22 about the seal bound outer surface portion 36 when the projectile 14 is
15 travelling through the barrel 12.

         A PROJECTILE BODY AND CORRESPONDING AMMUNITION ROUND FOR

   Technical Field
 5
   This document discloses a projectile body and corresponding ammunition round for
   small arms or a light firearm. To provide context, the term "small arms" is intended to
   denote firearms used by an individual including for example pistols, rifles, submachine
   guns, assault rifles and light machine guns; while the term "light firearm" is intended to
10 denote a "firearm" designed for use by two or more persons serving as a crew and may
   include heavy machine guns, and anti-aircraft guns all being less than about 100mm in
   calibre.
   Background Art
15
   A round of ammunition for small arms or a light firearm typically comprises a case and
   a projectile. The case has one end which is crimped onto the projectile. An opposite
   end of the case is formed with a planar base wall that seats a primer. A volume of
   propellant is held within the cartridge between the projectile and an inside of the planar
20 base wall. When the ammunition round is used, the primer is initiated usually
   mechanically by striking with a firing pin. This in turn causes deflagration of the
   propellant. Deflagration of the propellant results in the rapid generation of a large
   volume of gas. This gas expels the projectile from the case and propels the projectile
   through the barrel of the small arms or light firearm. The case may be expelled either
25 automatically or manually. Ammunition has also been proposed which does not
   comprise a case. This is sometimes known as caseless ammunition. An example of
   such ammunition is set out in US Patent No. 2,307,369 (Ferrel). This discloses a
   round of ammunition comprising a caseless projectile having a body defining a cavity
   which is filled with a propellant charge. One end of the projectile is closed by an
30 integral nose while an opposite end is closed by a firing cap. A soft metal jacket or
   sleeve is applied to the exterior of the projectile. The jacket is provided with shoulders
   that are configured to: engage with rifling of a barrel of a firearm; or, seal against the
   bore of a smooth bore firearm from which it is fired.
35 Summary of the Disclosure
   A projectile body and a corresponding ammunition round are disclosed. The round of
   10440925_1 (GHMatters) P93876.AU.3

                                                   -2
   ammunition may be used with or without a case. One general idea behind the
   disclosed projectile body and ammunition is to facilitate an equalisation of pressure
   between a portion of a length of the outside of the round and the inside of a barrel of a
   firearm from which the ammunition is fired. This is believed to reduce drag and
 5 thereby increase muzzle velocity. Additionally, this pressure equalisation allows for the
   use of a wider range of materials of construction than if the equalisation of pressure is
   not possible. The structure of the projectile body is in substance the same irrespective
   of whether the corresponding round is cased or caseless. Provision of a case easily
   adapts the round to be used with conventional small arms and light firearms without
10 need of any modification to the firearm.
   For ease of description throughout the remainder of this specification including the
   claims the term "firearm" is to be used to denote both small arms and light firearms as
   defined herein above. Thus, and in order to remove any doubt, the term "firearm" is
15 intended to denote a firearm designed for use by two or more persons serving as a
   crew and may include heavy machine guns, and anti-aircraft guns all being less than
   about 100mm in calibre; and pistols, rifles, smoothbore firearms, submachine guns,
   assault rifles and light machine guns. Also the terms "round", "ammunition", "round of
   ammunition" and "ammunition round" are all intended to have the same meaning and
20 define a ready to fire assembly of components comprising a projectile body, a charge
   of propellant, a primer and optionally a case.
   In one aspect there is disclosed a projectile body for an ammunition round for small
   arms or light firearm, the projectile body being elongated and comprising:
25              first and second axially opposed ends and a cavity extending between the first
   end and the second end, the first end being a leading end of the projectile and closed,
   the cavity being capable of holding a quantity of propellant for propelling the projectile
   body;
                a plurality of seals extending about an outer surface of the body, each seal
30 protruding radially from the body to form a substantial seal against an inner
   circumferential surface of the barrel, wherein two of the plurality of seals are mutually
   adjacent and spaced apart in a direction of a longitudinal axis of the body to form a
   seal bound outer surface portion of the body; and
                one or more holes formed in the body enabling fluid communication between
35 the cavity and the seal bound outer surface portion of the body.

   In one embodiment when the cavity holds propellant comprising a plurality of grains of
15 a solid propellant each hole is arranged to have a diameter at least at one point
   between the cavity and the seal bound outer surface portion that is no greater than
   about three times an average grain size of propellant.
   In one embodiment the body comprises a boat tail portion located between an end of
20 the seal bound outer surface portion of the body and the second end.

   of the body.
30
   In various embodiments the cavity is a single cavity for holding the propellant and has
   a longitudinal center line co-axial with longitudinal axis of the body.
   In all embodiments the projectile body may optionally comprise a sleeve disposed in
35 the cavity and wherein the one or more holes extend through the sleeve into the cavity,
   wherein propellant for propelling the projectile body is held in the sleeve.

                a primer supported in the base seal.
10
   In a third aspect there is disclosed an ammunition round comprising:
                a projectile body according to the first aspect;
                a tubular case sealed at one end by a base, the case fitted over a portion of the
   projectile body with the base adjacent the second end of the projectile body and

                a quantity of propellant retained within the cavity by the base, and wherein the
   first end of the projectile body protrudes from the case.
   In some embodiments of the ammunition round of the third aspect, the case and the
20 projectile body are relatively dimensioned so that the case at least partially overlies at
   least one seal on the projectile body. Thus in such embodiments the case may for
   example: wholly overlie or cover every seal; or, leave wholly exposed a forward most
   seal and completely overlie or cover all other seals; or partially cover a forward most
   seal and completely overlie or cover all other seals.
25
   However in alternate embodiments of the ammunition round of the third, the case and
   the projectile body are relatively dimensioned so that every seal on the projectile lies
   outside of the case.
30 In one embodiment of the ammunition round of the second or third aspects, the
   quantity of propellant is such that substantially the entire cavity is filled with the
   propellant. However in alternate embodiments of the third aspect a portion of the
   propellant is in the cavity and another portion of the propellant is between the second
   end of the projectile and the one end of the case.
35
   In some embodiments of the third aspect the projectile and the case are relatively
   dimensioned such that a space is formed between the second end of the projectile
   10440925_1 (GHMatters) P93876.AU.3

                                                    -5
   body and the base of the case and the propellant is retained between an inner surface
   of the cavity and the base of the case. In one form of such embodiments the
   propellant is provided in a volume greater than that of the space so that at least a
   proportion of the propellant is held in the cavity. However in an alternate form of such
 5 embodiments the propellant is provided in a volume to substantially fill the space and
   the cavity.
   In a fourth aspect there is disclosed an ammunition round for small arms or light
   firearm comprising:
10              a projectile body having first and second axially opposed ends and a cavity
   extending between the first end and the second end, the first end being a leading end
   of the projectile and closed, the cavity being capable of holding a quantity of propellant
   for propelling the projectile body;
                a plurality of seals extending about an outer surface of the body, each seal
15 protruding radially from the body to form a substantial seal against an inner
   circumferential surface of the barrel, wherein a first and a second of the plurality of
   seals are mutually adjacent and spaced apart in a direction of a longitudinal axis of the
   body to form a seal bound outer surface portion of the body; and
                one or more holes formed in the body enabling fluid communication between
20 the cavity and the seal bound outer surface portion of the body:
                wherein a forward most one of the seals is spaced from the first end, and rear
   most one of the seals is spaced from the second end so that the projectile body has a
   rearward portion located between an end of the seal bound outer surface portion of the
   body and the second end; and
25              a truncated case which at least partially accommodates the projectile body to
   close off the cavity and extends from the second end of the projectile body to a location
   that at most covers only the rear most seal.
   In variations of the fourth aspect the case may extend to a location along the projectile
30 body that: (a) partially overlies the rear most seal; or (b) extends to a location that does
   not cover or partially overlie the rear most seal, i.e. the case stops short of the rear
   most seal.

   Detailed Description of Specific Embodiments
   Figure 1 depicts an embodiment of an incomplete round of ammunition 10 (hereinafter
25 referred to in general as "round 10") in-situ in a barrel 12 of a firearm such as a rifle.
   For the purposes of exemplifying features of the round 10, the round 10 is described in
   the context of use in or with a 44 magnum firearm. However embodiments of the
   round 10 are not limited to only this type or calibre of firearm. (The round 10 as shown
   in Figure 1 is "incomplete" as it does not depict a base seal and primer.)
30
   The round 10 comprises a projectile 14 having an elongated body 16 with a first end or
   tip 18 and an axially opposed second end 20. The tip 18 constitutes the leading end of
   the round 10 and is closed. A cavity 22 is formed in the body 16 and extends from an
   inside of the tip 18 to the second end 20. A quantity of propellant 24 is held within the
35 cavity 22 for propelling the projectile. In one embodiment (for example the
   embodiment of Fig 1), the end 20 and cavity 22 are closed by a base seal 23.
   However in an alternate embodiment (for example shown in Fig. 3) the end 20 and
   10440925_1 (GHMatters) P93876.AU.3

                                                 -7
   cavity 22 may be closed by the provision of a case which is fitted over the body 16. In
   all embodiments a propellant ignition device (e.g. a primer) can be located integrally
   with the seal/case or external to the assembled round. Also the cavity is a single cavity
   for holding the propellant and has a longitudinal center line co-axial with a longitudinal
 5 axis 25 of the body.
   The projectile body 16 is provided with a seal arrangement which in the illustrated
   embodiments is constituted by a plurality of seals 26a, 26b, 26c and 26d (hereinafter
   referred to in general as "seals 26") that extend about an outer surface 30 of the body
10 16. Each seal 26 protrudes radially from the body 16 to form a substantial seal against
   an inner circumferential surface 32 of the barrel 12. The seals 26 in this embodiment
   are arranged in two sets of two seals where the seals in a set are spaced relatively
   closely to each other, but the sets are spaced apart by a greater distance. Specifically
   the seals 26a and 26b form a first set of seals; and seals 26c and 26d form a second
15 set of seals.
   The seal arrangement preforms various functions including: creating a seal between
   the body projectile 16 and the barrel 12 to stop pressure escaping forward of the
   projectile; stabilize / support the projectile 14 near its front and rear as it travels down
20 the barrel 12; minimise drag down the barrel 12; and, for a cased embodiment of the
   round 10, support the projectile body 16 in the case. At least two seals are required to
   perform all of these functions, one at or near the first end/tip 18 and a second spaced
   from the first seal and nearer the second end 20.
25 Each pair of mutually adjacent seals forms a corresponding seal bound outer surface
   portion of the body. For example seals 26a and 26b form a seal bound outer surface
   portion of the body (of a relatively short axial length); as do the pair constituted by inner
   most seals 26b and 26c, ( of a substantially greater axial length). The seal bound
   outer surface portion 36 between the seals 26b and 26c accommodates one or more
30 holes 38. The one or more holes 38 are formed in a body 16 to enable fluid
   communication between the cavity 22 and the seal bound outer surface portion 36.
   When the round 10 is fired from a firearm the propellant 24 progressively deflagrates.
   The deflagration causes the rapid generation of a large volume of gas which propels
35 the round 10 along the barrel 12. The majority of the generated gas is exhausted
   through the second end 20. When the round 10 is not provided with a case, this
   occurs by virtue of the gas either blowing out or burning through the base seal 23 fitted
   10440925_1 (GHMatters) P93876.AU.3

                                                -8
   to the end 20. When the round 10 is used with a case, the release of gas through the
   end 20 initially ejects the body 12 from the case. Irrespective of whether the round 10
   is cased or caseless, the pressure of the generated gas acts substantially
   instantaneously in all directions.
 5
   Thus gas within the cavity 22 will exert pressure on the walls of the body 16 tending to
   increase the outer diameter of the body 16 and pushing the surface 30 toward the
   surface 32. Also gas pressure acts between the inner surface 32 of the barrel from the
   second end 20 up to the seal 26b. However, in the region 39 between the portion 36
10 and the surface 32, which is sealed from the proximal end of the barrel 12, the
   pressure of the deflagrating gas is exerted substantially from within the cavity 22 only.
   (The region 39 is a dynamic region because the projectile is travelling along the barrel
   12.) The provision of the holes 38 in the present embodiment allows fluid
   communication between the cavity 22 and the seal bound outer surface portion 36. As
15 a result, there will be a substantial equalisation of gas pressure on opposite sides of
   the wall of the body 16 about the seal bound outer surface portion 36. Consequently,
   there is substantially no net force applied from the cavity 22 onto the corresponding
   portion of the body 16 that may otherwise tend to cause radial expansion of the body
   16 so as to contact the surface 32. In turn this minimises the risk of increasing drag
20 thereby maximising muzzle velocity.
   Due to the equalisation of pressure arising from the provision of the holes 38 it is
   possible to make the body 16 from materials which may have a lower strength than
   those which would otherwise be required in order to resist such radial expansion.
25 Some of these materials may have a relatively high density (e.g. lead) but in the
   absence of the holes 38 would need relatively thick wall to resist radial expansion.
   This would reduce the volume of the cavity and thus the amount of propellant 24. As
   the present embodiment enables the use of thinner walls it is possible to make for
   example the body 16 from lead without reducing the volume of the cavity 22. An
30 alternately beneficial effect of this embodiment is that it enables the body 16 to be
   made from thinner walled material than would otherwise be possible in order to resist
   the outward radial expansion. In the first instance, where say a lower strength but
   higher density material is used, greater stopping power may be derived by virtue of the
   increased mass having regard to the kinetic energy of the projectile 14 being
35 calculated using the equation E= % mv2 . However in the second instance where a
   projectile is manufactured with thinner walls and may otherwise be possible in the
   absence of the holes 38, increased stopping power is achieved by virtue of the lighter
   10440925_1 (GHMatters) P93876.AU.3

                                                -9
   mass being able to accelerate more quickly and reach higher muzzle velocity. It would
   be recognised from the aforementioned kinetic energy equation of E= % mv 2 , that
   improving velocity provides a squared increase in kinetic energy.
 5 The holes 38 may be considered as pressure bleed or equalisation holes. A plurality of
   such holes 38 can be provided spaced about the axis 25 of the projectile 14 in such a
   manner as to ensure no adverse impact on the balance and stability of the projectile.
   For example, four holes 38 may be provided in a common transverse plane spaced 900
   apart about the axis 25. The holes 38 are shown in this embodiment as circular in
10 transverse section, but other transverse section shapes are possible such as but not
   limited to oval, oblong, and rectangular. In one embodiment in order to prevent or at
   least minimise the expelling of propellant 24 through the holes 38 during manufacture,
   transport, storage or an initial phase of deflagration, the holes 38 may be dimensioned
   to have, at least at one point between the cavity 22 and the seal bound outer surface
15 portion 36, an internal diameter D1 that is no greater than three times an average grain
   size of the propellant. By dimensioning the holes 38 in this manner grains are more
   likely to bridge across the inner diameter of the holes 38 rather than pass through and
   escape from the holes 38. However the bridged grains will form pathways that allow
   the escape of gas through the holes 38.
20
   If for any reason it is found necessary to form the holes larger than the above
   dimensions, alternative sealing arrangements of the holes may be necessary to
   prevent leakage of the propellant. The selection of the sealing arrangements shall be
   such that upon deflagration, the holes become sufficiently clear to allow the
25 equalisation of the pressures to occur in the same manner as if the holes were
   unsealed. Indeed irrespective of hole diameters in other embodiments each or any
   hole 38 may be provided with temporary sealing arrangements or devices such as (a)
   a frangible seal, (b) a seal arranged to eject from the holes, or (c) a seal arranged burn
   away or melt; all by action of deflagration of propellant held in the cavity. A frangible
30 seal may be a thin metal foil or plastic film; an ejectable seal may be made from of a
   stopper made form cellulose, wood or cork; while sealing devices that burn or melt be
   also be made from paper, wax, plastics, lead, or thin metal foil. The sealing
   arrangements or devices of course also act to retain the propellant within the cavity 22
   during manufacture, handling, transport and storage. Additionally the sealing
35 arrangements or devices can provide protection against the external environment to
   minimize degradation due to for example moisture absorption or oxidation.

                                                - 10
   In the present embodiment shown in Figure 1 the holes 38 extend in a radial direction
   transverse to the axis 25. However as shown in Figure 2, the holes 38 are formed with
   an alternate configuration. Figure 2 illustrates an embodiment of a round 10' which
   differs from the round 10 depicted in Figure 1 only by way of configuration of its
 5 respective holes designated as 38'. In the projectile 10', the holes 38' extend obliquely
   relative to the longitudinal axis 25 of the round 10. The angle of inclination of the hole
   38' is such that an outer opening 40 of the hole 38' formed on the seal bound outer
   surface portion 36 is closer to the tip 18 than an inner end 42 of the hole 38'. A
   potential benefit of the inclining of the holes 38' in this manner is that once the round
10 10 has been ejected from the barrel 12 and the propellant 24 has fully or substantially
   deflagrated, the holes 38' provide a channel for air to flow into the cavity 22 and out
   from the second end 20. This airflow can reduce drag associated with turbulence
   generated at the second end 22. As an alternative embodiment, the holes may be
   elongated or slotted in an axial direction to provide the same effect.
15
   Further features and variations of the projectile 14 and corresponding round 10 will
   now be described.
   In the depicted embodiment, the tip 18 is in the form of an ogive. The ogive has a
20 radius R of about 2.5 times diameter D of the projectile 14. The diameter D of the
   round is its maximum diameter and corresponds with the calibre of the round. Thus
   with reference to Figure 1, R = 2.5D. In the context of the round 10 being for a 44
   magnum calibre firearm, D = 0.429" (about 10.9mm). However, the tip 18 may be
   formed in other known configurations including for example but not limited to, hollow
25 points, soft points, full metal jacket, spitzer, flat nose, semi-wad cutter and wad cutter.
   The ogive tip 18 may be a secant ogive or a tangential ogive.
   The seals 26 in this embodiment are formed integrally with and from the same material
   as the body 14. That is the seals 26 and the body 14 constitute a one piece structure.
30 This may be achieved for example by a casting process, swaging, machining, or a
   combination of any or all. It is however also possible to form the seals separately from
   the body 14 and subsequently engage or otherwise couple the seals 26 to the body 14.
   For example this may be achieved by providing grooves in the body 14 and
   subsequently seating split ring bands in the grooves which act as the seals 26. Such
35 seals can be made for example from a material having radial resilience or spring
   nature such as spring steal; or materials which are plastically deformable such as lead
   or copper; also it is not necessary for the seals 26 to be made from the same material
   10440925_1 (GHMatters) P93876.AU.3

                                                      - 11
   as the body 16. In a further variation, the seals 26 may be made separately from the
   body 14 and formed as single continuous rings which are subsequently cast into the
   body 14. That also results in the seals 26 and the body 14 constituting a one piece
   structure. The core of the projectile could be clad in a material of different composition
 5 to better suit the purpose of sealing and contact with the firearm bore.
   In the present embodiment the seals 26 are arranged as two pairs. A first pair of seals
   26a and 26b is located adjacent or near the tip 18 while the second pair of seals 26c
   and 26d is spaced from the first pair in an axial direction toward the second end 20.
10 The spacing between the inner most seals 26b and 26c defines the seal bound outer
   surface portion 36. In alternate embodiments, the seals may be provided as two single
   seals that are axially spaced along the body 14 to form the seal bound outer surface
   portion 36. Thus with reference to Figure 1, this can be achieved by forming the round
    10 with only for example the seals 26a and 26c; or 26a and 26d; or 26b and 26c; or
15 26b and 26d.
   A spacing L between outer most points of the two axially most spaced apart seals 26a
   and 26d will preferably satisfy the relationship L D. Naturally in the event of the seal
   arrangement comprising two sets of two or more seals, as in the specific embodiment
20 shown in Figure 1, this spacing relationship is also necessarily be satisfied by having a
   spacing Li               D between the outer most points of the inner seals 26b and 26c.
   Although in some cases L<D is possible, for stability of the projectile 10 as it travels
   down the barrel 12 it is believed the outer most seals 26a and 26d should be separated
25 by at least one diameter of the projectile 14. In other embodiments, this spacing may
   be equivalent to the length of the parallel sides of the body 16. In this regard, it will be
   noted from Figure 1 that the tip 18 of the projectile 14 is tapered to reduce in width
   forming the rounded nose. Also, a rear portion of the projectile 14 is tapered to reduce
   in outer diameter to form a "boat tail". (The formation and effect of the boat tail will be
30 described later). However between the tip 18 and the tapered back portion of the body
    12, the projectile 14 has parallel sides. Stated another way, any axial plane between
   the tip 18 and the tapered back portion of the body 12 will intersect the outer surface
   30 to form two parallel lines. The inner most seals 26b and 26c can be spaced apart to
   be at respective opposite ends of these lines. In such instances, again depending on
35 the calibre of the projectile, the internal profile of the cartridge case and its overall
   length, this distance may be greater than D.
   10440925_1 (GHMatters) P93876.AU.3

                                                 - 12
   When the seals are provided as sets of two seals 26a, 26b; and 26c, 26d the spacing
   between each seal in its respective set may be in the order of the axial length of each
   seal.
 5 It will be noted that in this embodiment the forward most or leading seal 26a is formed
   with a rounded leading face being a contiguous portion of the tip 18 with a change in
   radius of curvature. A trailing face 40 of the seal 26a forms a right angle shoulder with
   the outer surface 30 of the body 16. Each of the seals 26b, 26c and 26d has a
   circumferential outer surface of constant radius and is formed with right angle leading
10 and trailing faces 42 and 44 (shown in relation to seal 26d only). The axial length of
   the seals 26b, 26c and 26d are the same as each other, but shorter than the axial
   length of the seal 26a.
   As discussed above, a rear portion of the projectile 14 is formed in the configuration of
15 a boat tail 46. The provision of a boat tail 46 improves the ballistic performance of the
   round 10 and also allows seating of the projectile 14 in a case or cartridge deeper than
   if the boat tail was not present, therefore allowing more of the propellant charge to be
   contained within the projectile body. (This is explained in greater detail below with
   reference to Figure 3). The boat tail 46 is provided with a taper of approximately 100
20 over a length of about one diameter D of the projectile 14 or as appropriate for the
   internal profile of the case.
   In one embodiment the entirety of the cavity 22 of the projectile is filled with propellant
   22 so that there is in essence no free space (save for the holes 38) within the cavity
25 22. As a consequence, upon initial burning of the propellant 24 the resultant gas
   pressure has the effect of compacting the propellant against interior walls of the cavity
   22. This is to be contrast in situations where a projectile may include for example a
   cavity in the tip 18 which is not filled with propellant; or otherwise has a cavity 22 that is
   not completely filled with propellant. In such instances, the perceived advantages of
30 containing the deflagrating propellant within the projectile body may not be fully
   realized.
   In an example of the round 10 being applied to a 44 magnum calibre firearm, the round
   10 may have the following dimensions:
35
                Overall length L2 = 1.504" (38mm)
                A maximum diameter D = 0.049" (11mm)

                Radial projection distance of seals 26 beyond parallel portions of outer surface
                32 of the body 30 d2 = 0.040" (1mm)
 5 Figure 3 depicts a cased version of a round of ammunition designated as 10". The
   round 10" comprises the combination either of the round 10 or 10' together with an
   external case 50. The case 50 is of conventional construction and in essence
   comprises tubular body 52 that is open at a front end 54 and closed at a base 56. A
   circumferential wall 56 of the tube 52 increases in thickness by way of a reduction of its
10 internal diameter in the direction from the front end 54 to the base 56. This increase in
   wall thickness and reduction in internal diameter is in a portion of the case 50 adjacent
   the base 56. The distance from the opening of the case to the point within the case
   where the internal taper commences dictates the maximum possible length of a portion
   of the projectile having parallel sides within the case 50. This accommodates the boat
15 tail 46 of the projectile 14 so as to maintain a relatively constant spacing between the
   outer surface 30 of the body 16 and the internal diameter of the case 50. The base 56
   is provided with a flash hole 58 in alignment with a primer 60. The primer 60 is fitted
   into a central recess 62 formed in the base 56. When the primer 60 is initiated,
   typically by impact with a firing pin, a flame is produced which passes through the flash
20 hole 58 to ignite propellant 24 within the cavity 22 of the projectile 14.
   The projectile 14 and case 50 are configured so that when assembled and prior to
   firing, the front end 54 of the case 50 is adjacent or near the forward most seal 26a. In
   some but not necessarily all embodiments the front end may be in contact with and/or
25 partially overlie the forward most seal 26a. Also in this embodiment the front end 54
   does not extend beyond the forward most seal 26. The case 50 can be configured
   particularly in relation to its outer diameter to match the breach of any conventional
   firearm. In this way, the benefits of the caseless version of the round 10 can be
   enjoyed with any conventional firearm simply by loading the suitably designed
30 projectile 14 into a case 50 configured to match the breach of the firearm.
   It should be appreciated that the configuration of the round 10" is different to a
   conventional round comprising a projectile and case where the propellant is held within
   the case between a base of the projectile and inside of the base of the case. This
35 differences lie in that in the present embodiments at least some of the propellant is
   held within the projectile 14; and, the projectile 14 includes a portion that extends for a
   substantial length of the inside of the case 50 (being at least about one half but up to
   10440925_1 (GHMatters) P93876.AU.3

                                                  -14
   the full length of the case 50).
   In the event that the projectile 14 extends for substantially the full length of the case
   the second end 20 of the projectile 14 will be in contact with or close to an inside
 5 surface of the base 56. In such circumstances substantially all of the propellant 24 is
   held within the cavity 22. But in other embodiments where say the projectile 14
   occupies from say % to 2/3 of the length of the case 50, while all of the propellant 24
   still resides between an inside surface of the cavity 22 and the base 56, a substantial
   volume of the propellant 24 may lie outside of the cavity 22 in a space between the end
10 20 and the base 56. This may occur for example where the volume of propellant 24 is
   substantially less than the combined volume of the cavity 22 and the volume of the
   space between the end 20 and the base 56. Irrespective of the proportion of propellant
   in the cavity 22, ordinarily the tip 18 will project beyond the forward most end 54 of the
   case 50.
15
   For the purposes of comparison, Figure 4 is a representation of a prior art 44
   Remington magnum round 110. The round 110 comprises a projectile 114 crimped to
   a case 150. The case 150 may be identical to the case 50 of the round 10". A
   comparison however between the projectiles 14 and 114 highlights various benefits
20 and superior features of embodiments of the present projectile 14. In this regard it is
   noted that the exposed portion of the projectile 114 in round 110 has a tip 118 provided
   with a flat nose 119. Also the circumferential surface of the projectile 114 from the flat
   nose 119 is formed with a surface portion 121 that progressively and linearly increases
   in outer diameter in a direction toward the case 150. A second or back end 120 of the
25 projectile 114 terminates a relatively short distance within the cartridge 150. A portion
    123 of the circumferential surface of projectile 114 within the case 150 has a
   substantially constant outer diameter until very close to the second end 120 where it
   tapers inwardly. A typical overall length LR for the projectile 114 may be about 0.64
   inches (16.26mm). The projectile body 16 and the case 50 are dimensionally related in
30 terms of their respective lengths so that the projectile does not protrude excessively
   from the case and retains volume within the case to contain the propellant charge.
   A comparison between the projectiles 14 and 114 highlights the following:
35 (a)      The outer surface of the tip 18 and projectile 14 is radiused to a point rather than
            being linearly tapered to a flat nose 119 as in the projectile 114. As a
            consequence of this, the "front end" aerodynamics of the projectile 14 are superior
   10440925_1 (GHMatters) P93876.AU.3

                                                   - 15
            to those of the projectile 114 in terms of reducing drag, turbulence and air
            resistance. It is not possible to simply transfer the configuration of the tip 18 of
            projectile 14 to the projectile 114. The reason for this is to accommodate the
            curvature of the tip 18 substantially the full length of the projectile 114 will be
 5          required to be formed with a radiused outer surface. This will result in only a very
            small band of the projectile 114 having an outer diameter matched to the calibre
            of the barrel from the firearm from which it is fired. As a result in-barrel stability
            may be substantially compromised. To provide good in-barrel stability it is
            generally recommended that effective length of the projectile 14 in contact with
10          the inner surface (and rifling) of a barrel be about the same as the diameter of the
            projectile.
   (b) The cased version of the round 10" is provided with a boat tail 46 near the second
            end 20. The boat tail reduces turbulence and thereby further increases or
15          improves the aerodynamics of the projectile 14. With the projectile 114, it is
            physically not possible to incorporate the boat tail as there is insufficient length in
            the projectile 114 on which to form the boat tail while also maintaining
            recommended minimum contact area between the projectile 114 and the inside
            surface of a firearm barrel. This allows a longer and lighter projectile 14 to be
20          made that does not adversely compromise the potential propellant charge or
            make the projectile excessively heavy.
   (c)      In the projectile 114 substantially the full length of the portion 123 of the projectile
            114 is in contact with the inner surface of a firearm barrel. In comparison
25          however with the projectile 14 of the round 10" it is only the outer circumferential
            surfaces of the seals 26 that are in contact with the inner surface of the barrel.
            This total contact area is substantially smaller than the contact area of the
            projectile 114 and thus there is less drag between the projectile 14 and the barrel
            in comparison to that for the projectile 114. Nonetheless, stability is maintained or
30          indeed can be improved with the projectile 14 by virtue of the spacing of the seals
            26a and 26d. The improved stability may be derived by spacing the outer most
            seals 26a and 26d by a distance greater than the one diameter of the projectile
            14. This is possible with the projectile 14 as its overall length is substantially
            greater than: its diameter; and, that of the projectile 114.
35
   (d) By virtue of the pressure equalisation holes 38 it is possible to vary the material
            and weight of the projectile 14 to suit a particular task. For example, the projectile
   10440925_1 (GHMatters) P93876.AU.3

                                                 -  16
            14 may be made from a relatively light material so that the overall weight of the
            projectile 14 may be less than that of the projectile 114. While on the face of it
            this may seem to be a disadvantage, the lighter weight results in a higher velocity
            of the projectile 14 in comparison to the projectile 114 for the same amount of
 5          propellant. Increasing the velocity has a square effect on increasing kinetic
            energy and thus stopping power whereas changes in mass produce only a linear
            change in kinetic energy.
   Each of the above differences and/or benefits arise from various features of the
10 disclosed projectile and will be realized whether or not the associated round of
   ammunition is cased or caseless.
   Whilst a number of specific embodiments of the round have been described it should
   be appreciated that the round may be embodied in many other forms. For example,
15 round 10 is depicted with a projectile 14 having a boat tail 46 near the end 20.
   However in alternate embodiments, the projectile 14 may be formed with a constant
   outer diameter up to the end 20. This is particularly applicable in the uncased or
   caseless version of the round 10. In this instance, if desired, further seals 26 may be
   formed about the body 16 between the seal 26d and the end 20 to engage and form a
20 seal with the inside surface 32 of the barrel 12. In this event additional holes 38 may
   be formed between such seal and the seal 26d to provide pressure equalisation.
   The round 10, 10', 10" may be formed with only two spaced apart seals, for example
   26a and 26d. In this instance it will be these seals that form the seal bound outer
25 surface portion 36. In another embodiment the round may be formed with a plurality of
   axially spaced seals 26 where each mutually adjacent pair forms a respective seal
   bound outer surface portion (as indeed is the case with the current depicted
   embodiments with seals 26a, 26b, 26c and 26d) but where there is at least one hole 38
   that provides fluid communication between the cavity 22 and two or more of the seal
30 bound outer surface portions. In such an embodiment the seals may be evenly spaced
   in the axial direction. Irrespective of how many seals 26 are provided in excess of two
   seals required to form a seal bound outer surface portion, the spacing between the two
   outer most seals may be a minimum of about one diameter D of the round.
35 The above and other variations are depicted in Figures 5 - 9. Figure 5 depicts a round
    1Oa which differs from the round 10 only by way of exclusion of the seals 26b and 26c.
   Thus the round 1Oa now only has two seals namely seals 26a and 26d. These two
   10440925_1 (GHMatters) P93876.AU.3

                                                - 17
   seals between them define the seal bound outer surface portion 36. Holes 38 are
   arranged to open into the seal bound outer surface portion. In all other respects, the
   round 10a is the same as round 10 and may be used in either a cased or uncased
   manner.
 5
   Figure 6 depicts an embodiment of a round 1Ob which differs from the round 10 shown
   in Figure 1 by arranging the seals in two sets of three closely spaced seals. Thus the
   seal arrangement in the projectile 10b now comprises a first set of seals 26a, 26b and
   26e which are closely spaced from each other and near the first end 18 of the projectile
10  1ob; and a second set of three seals namely seals 26f, 26c, and 26d that are axially
   spaced from the first set of seals. The seal bound outer surface portion 36 comprises
   the region of the outer surface of the body 14 bound between the two inner most
   adjacent seals 26e and 26f. Thus the holes 38 open into the region 36. The projectile
    10b can be used in either a cased or uncased manner.
15
   Figure 7 depicts a further possible variation in the configuration of a round 1Oc in
   accordance with the present disclosure. Here, the round 10c comprises three sets of
   seals each set comprising one seal only. The first set of seals comprises a seal 26a,
   the second set comprises the seal 26g, and the third set comprises the seal 26d. Seal
20 26g is axially spaced from the seal 26a in a direction toward the second end 20. The
   seal 26d is axially spaced from the seal 26g also in a direction toward the second end
   20. This arrangement of seals provides the round 1Oc with two seal bound outer
   surface portions 36a and 36b. The seal bound outer surface portion 36a is defined
   between the seals 26a and 26g; while the seal bound outer surface portion 36b is
25 defined between the seals 26g and 26d. Holes 38 are provided in the projectile 14 to
   enable pressure equalisation between the cavity 22 and an inside surface of a barrel
    12 of a firearm in each of the seal bound outer surface portions 36a and 36b.
   Thus, the round 1Oc has a plurality of seals 26a, 26g and 26d which protrude radially
30 from the body 16 of the projectile 14 to form a substantial seal against an inner
   circumferential surface of a barrel of a firearm 12. Further, two of the seals either 26a
   and 26g; or 26g and 26d; are mutually adjacent and spaced apart in a direction of a
   longitudinal axis of the body 16 to form respective seal bound outer surface portions of
   the body. Naturally, the seal 1Oc may comprise further variations such as forming
35 each of the three sets of single seals as three sets of two or more closely spaced
   seals. The projectile 1Oc may be used in either a cased or uncased version in the
   same manner as described above in relation to the projectile 10.

                                                - 18
   Figure 8 depicts an embodiment of a round 1Od which differs from the round 10 shown
   in Figure 1 by: the omission of the boat tail 46; a re-shaping of the end of the cavity 22
   near the first end 18; a reduction in thickness T of the wall of body 16 in the seal bound
 5 region 36 and extending to the second end 20; and, the inclusion of a sleeve 70. The
   sleeve 70 is closed at an end adjacent the first end 18 and open at an opposite end
   adjacent the second end 20. The sleeve 70 forms a lining to the cavity 22. In this
   embodiment the end of each of the cavity 22 and the end of the sleeve 70 near end 18
   is formed with a dome like configuration. This is to be contrast with the conical
10 configuration of the cavity 22 near the first end 18 of the first embodiment. The
   omission of the boat tail 46 and the reduction in wall thickness T are for the purposes
   of accommodating the sleeve 70 and maintaining the same (or indeed allowing a slight
   increase in) the volume of propellant 24 that can be loaded into the projectile 14. The
   holes 38 are formed through the body 16 and the sleeve 70.
15
   The sleeve 70 may be made from a material of higher specific density than that of the
   body 16. This provides greater overall weight to the projectile 14 than an identically
   configured projectile without the sleeve and made from a lower specific gravity
   material. By shaping the sleeve to have a thickened wall near the end 18 the sleeve
20 can bias the increase of overall weight toward the first end 18. However this is not an
   essential requirement. In an alternate configuration the sleeve can have a constant
   wall thickness. In one example the body 16 may be made from steel or brass while the
   sleeve 70 may be made from lead or depleted uranium. The sleeve 70 is not required
   to provide resistance to radial expansion of the projectile 16. This is due to the
25 presence of the holes 38 which provide pressure equalization between the cavity 24
   and the space defined between the seal bound outer surface portion 36 and the inside
   surface of the barrel 12. According while it is possible for the sleeve 70 to be stronger
   in terms of resisting radial expansion than the body 16 of the projectile 14 there is no
   need for this characteristic. Also while in this specific embodiment the boat tail 46 has
30 been omitted this in not essential in order to include a sleeve. This is exemplified by
   the dotted line 72 in Figure 1 which together with the dashed line depicted a sleeve 70'.
   The cased version of the round of ammunition 10" as shown in Figure 3 depicts each
   of the seals 26 wholly or at least partially within the case 50. In particular seal 26a is
35 partially covered by the case 50 while the remaining seals 26b - 26d are wholly within
   the case 50. However it is not essential for every cased version or embodiment of the
   round to be formed such that all or indeed any of the seals are within or at least
   10440925_1 (GHMatters) P93876.AU.3

                                                - 19
   partially covered by the case 50. Thus, for example the case may extend to a location
   along the projectile body 14 that: (a) at most covers only the rear most seal; or (b)
   partially overlies the rear most seal; or (c) extends to a location that does not cover or
   partially overlie the rear most seal, i.e. the case stops short of the rear most seal (as
 5 exemplified in Figure 9 discussed below).
   It is generally not preferred for the projectile to engage with rifling in a barrel until the
   round is fired. Thus depending on the configuration of the firearm including its breach
   and barrel, embodiments of the disclosed ammunition round are possible where one or
10 more seals 26 lie outside of the case 50. For example with reference to Figure 3
   depending on the firearm configuration and geometry, the round 10" could be modified
   so that the case 50 terminates at a point radially coincident with a leading edge of the
   seal 26b; or say between seals 26a and 26b.
15 Figure 9 depicts a further embodiment of a round 10e which may be conveniently
   referred to as a "semi-cased" round. In Figure 9 the reference numbers used are
   intended to denote the same features as used in herein before with reference to earlier
   described embodiments. The round 10e in general terms includes a projectile body 14
   similar to the projectile for the round 1Oc shown in Figure 7 fitted with a truncated case
20 50e. The projectile body 14 as per earlier embodiments has a tip or leading end 18
   and a second end 20. A cavity 22 extends axially within the body 14 from the end 20
   toward the tip 18. Three seals 26a, 26b and 26c are formed on the body 14. The
   seals are spaced apart in the axial direction with sets of holes 38 between mutually
   adjacent seals. Thus two seal bound outer surface portions 36 are formed. One
25 between the seals 26a and 26b which have an intervening set of holes 38; and another
   between the seals 26b and 26c which are also provided with an intervening set of
   holes 38. A boat tail 46 is formed near a rear end of the projectile body 14 leading to
   the second end 20. The truncated case 50e acts to at least partially accommodate the
   boat tail 46 as well as to close off the cavity 22 and second end 20, and accommodate
30 a primer 60. It will be seen that in this embodiment the case 50e does not extend over
   or cover any of the seals 26. In this embodiment the truncated case 50e in acts to seal
   the breach in a conventional firearm and contain the contents of the projectile body 14
   as well as providing an initiation source for propellant held within the cavity 22. It is
   envisaged that such embodiments will utilise hole sealing devices of a type as
35 described above in order to retain the propellant within the cavity 22 and provide
   protection from the external environment.

   In each of the variations shown in Figures 5 - 9 the respective projectiles may be
   further varied to incorporate variations discussed above in relation to the projectiles 10,
   10' and 10" described in relation to Figures 1-3. This includes for example the
   reconfiguration of the holes 38 to be inclined as shown for example in Figure 2.
 5 Further, in relation to the round 1Oc shown in Figure 7, the holes 38 that provide
   pressure equalisation to the different seal bound outer surface portions 36a and 36b
   may be inclined at different angles to each other. Also the sleeve 70 may be
   incorporated in each of the embodiments depicted in Figures 2, 3, 5, 6, 7 and 9.
   Further in the embodiments of Figures 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7 and 9 the seal 26a is shown as
10 having a rounded leading face and a right angle trailing face 40. In each embodiment
   either one or both of the leading face and trailing face of seal 26a can be at a right
   angle or inclined to the axis 25 or can be curved. Indeed all or any of the seals 26 can
   have either one or both of their leading and trailing faces configured to be: a right angle
   or inclined to the axis 25; or curved.

   Figure 10 and the tables below provide a comparison between various know prior art
   projectiles (i.e. bullets) and equivalent calibre embodiments of the present projectile.
   Figure 10 depicts a prior art Berger 7mm 180 grain VLD (very low drag) bullet/projectile
   P labelled with the dimensional parameters OAL; D; BT; N; and BS. These parameters
20 are explained below:
                OAL - (OverAll Length) is the overall length of a projectile P from its forward
                most tip 80 to its rearward most surface 82.
25              D - (Diameter) is the maximum diameter of the projectile P and corresponds
                with the calibre. The diameter D is measured at the maximum diameter of the
                projectile.
                BT - (Boat Tail) is a tapered rearward portion of the projectile P which provides
30              a reduction in outer diameter from the maximum diameter D to the end 82.
                N - (Nose) may be considered as the forward tapered portion of the projectile P
                from the forward most portion having the diameter D to the tip 80. In most
                projectiles the nose end is tapered to reduce in diameter in a direction toward
35              the tip 80.
                BS - (Bearing surface) may be considered as the length of the projectile P
   10440925_1 (GHMatters) P93876.AU.3

                                                   - 21
                having the diameter D. In a projectile P without separate radially projecting
                seals the BS will equate to the length of the projectile P that contacts the rifling
                of a barrel.
 5 In Table 1 below the heading "7mm Projectile 10 Variation A" is reference to a 7mm
   calibre version of the projectile 10 with an OAL of 2" (2 inches). The heading "7mm
   Projectile 10 Variation B" is reference to a 7mm calibre version of the projectile 10 with
   an OAL of 3" (3 inches). The increase in OAL in variation B is spread evenly between
   the length of the boat tail and the bearing surface, each increasing by %" over the
10 equivalent dimensions of variation A.
   A comparison between the Berger 7mm VLD and both variations A and B indicate that
   for the same diameter D and length of Nose both variations A and B of the present
   projectile 10 provide a longer bearing surface and boat tail. The longer bearing surface
15 provides improved stability while the increased length in boat tail assists in reducing
   dynamic drag.
   The column "ratio" in Table 1 is the ratio of the length of the characteristic in question
   in comparison to the diameter D of the projectile in question. Thus for example
20 OAL/D=5.534; D/D=1; BT/D=0.726 etc. The change in these ratios for variations A and
   B of the projectile 10 in comparison with the corresponding ratio for the Berger 7mm
   projectile as shown in Table 1 as headings A% A and A% B. For example a
   comparison between the OAL ratios of variation A of the projectile 10 to the Berger
   projectile to is 7.257/5.534 = 131 % (OAL A%A).
