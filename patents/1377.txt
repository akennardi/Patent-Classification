   FIELD OF THE INVENTION
   The present invention relates to pharmaceutical compositions comprising 4-pregenen
   11 P-1 7-21 -triol-3,20-dione derivatives, and their use as pharmaceuticals as modulators
   of the glucocorticoid receptors (GR) and/or the mineralocorticoid receptors (MR). The
 5 invention relates specifically to the use of these compounds and their pharmaceutical
   compositions to treat ocular conditions associated with the glucocorticoid receptors
   (GR) and/or the mineralocorticoid receptors (MR).
   BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
 0 Glucocorticoid (GC) agonists represent a class of anti-inflammatory compounds that are
   useful in treating multiple ocular conditions including elevated intraocular pressure,
   glaucoma, uveitis, retinal vein occlusions, macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy,
   various forms of macular edema, post-surgical inflammation, inflammatory conditions of
   the palpebral and bulbar conjunctiva, cornea, and anterior segment of the globe, such
25 as allergic conjunctivitis, ocular rosacea, dry eye, blepharitis, retinal detachment,
   meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD), superficial punctate keratitis, herpes zoster
   keratitis, iritis, cyclitis, selected infective conjunctivitis, corneal injury from chemical,
   radiation, or thermal burns, penetration of foreign bodies, allergy, or combinations
   thereof.

   A potential use limiting and sight-threatening side-effect of traditional GC agonist
   therapies (e.g. fluocinolone acetonide) is ocular hypertension that is likely generated by
   an increased resistance of aqueous humor flow through the trabecular meshwork. The
   mechanism of GC agonist-induced outflow resistance and subsequent ocular
 5 hypertension is not well understood.
   As such, GC modulation through agonist or antagonist activity of GC receptors that
   does not result in increased intraocular pressure or other side effects is needed in the
   art and is described herein.

   Described herein are compounds capable of modulating glucocorticoid receptors (GR)
   and/or mineralocorticoid receptors (MR). The compounds described can have greater
   GR activation and/or binding potency compared to a compound such as cortisol. As
   such, the compounds can efficiently treat ocular indications. The compounds can
 0 further be metabolized by esterase enzymes within the eye to form the natural agonist
   cortisol, thereby reducing the risk of ocular hypertension. The cortisol remaining within
   the eye and body is further metabolized to inactive compounds via naturally occurring
   dehydroxylases and other enzymes making this a safe therapeutic approach.
 5 In patients, the naturally occurring endogenous GC agonist cortisol (hydrocortisone) has
   a minimal effect on intraocular pressure when applied locally via eye drops compared to
   synthetic GCs such as dexamethasone, prednisolone, and fluorometholone (Cantrill et
   al., 1975). Further support of the overall superior safety of cortisol as a therapeutic is
   the fact that various topical hydrocortisone formulations are currently sold over the
 0 counter directly to consumers.
   Without wishing the bound to any particular theory, it was surprisingly discovered that
   the presently described compounds can have more glucocorticoid receptor modulation
   than cortisol because of the modification to the 17-position of the cortisol molecule.

   Glucocorticoid Receptor Transactivation Potencies for
   Cortisol and 17-ester Derivatives
 5
   Glucocorticoid receptor (GR) activation potency was assessed using a HeLa cell line
   containing the MMTV-bla reporter (MMTV-bla HeLa CELLSENSOR@, Invitrogen Corp.,
   Carlsbad, CA). This cell line was stably transfected with an expression construct
   containing p-lactamase cDNA under control of the MMTV response element previously
 0 identified as a glucocorticoid receptor response element.
   Results from one experiment performed in duplicate for 9 compounds and the control
   compound, dexamethasone, are summarized in Table 3. All assays were performed as
   10-point dose responses using a half log-fold dilution series starting with a maximum
 5 compound concentration of 100 nM. The compounds were incubated for 5 hours. The
   activation of endogenous GR leads to expression of the reporter p-lactamase which is
   detected by the conversion of a FRET substrate in a ratiometric assay format. This
   functional assay allows for measurement of receptor agonism by compounds and can
   be used to determine compound potency and selectivity. Assay reproducibility was
 0 determined by calculating Z' values for untreated versus maximum stimulation. The Z'
   value was greater than 0.6, indicating good reproducibility of the assay format.
   Several compounds showed dose-dependent stimulation of the GR signaling pathway
   (Table 3). Compounds of Table 1 showed about 30-fold greater potency compared to
25 the parent molecule cortisol.
