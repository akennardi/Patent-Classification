   Detailed Description
30
   Referring to the drawings, there is shown a gaming system
   having a game controller arranged to implement a game
   where an rotating object with a changing axis of rotation
   is used to display a win outcome modifier when . In an
35 embodiment, the object is a multiplier ball having a
   plurality of different multipliers thereon. The modifier
   that applies is that modifier that is displayed when the
                                           10134011_1 (GHMatters) P74138.AU.5 3/04/18

                              - 8
   ball stops. In an embodiment, the multipliers at intervals
   around the surface in regions whose sizes are based at
   least partly on the value of the modifier. The gaming
   system can take a number of different forms.
 5
   In a first form, a stand alone gaming machine is provided
   wherein all or most components required for implementing
   the game are present in a player operable gaming machine.
10 In a second form, a distributed architecture is provided
   wherein some of the components required for implementing
   the game are present in a player operable gaming machine
   and some of the components required for implementing the
   game are located remotely relative to the gaming machine.
15 For example, a "thick client" architecture may be used
   wherein part of the game is executed on a player operable
   gaming machine and part of the game is executed remotely,
   such as by a gaming server; or a "thin client"
   architecture may be used wherein most of the game is
20 executed remotely such as by a gaming server and a player
   operable gaming machine is used only to display audible
   and/or visible gaming information to the player and
   receive gaming inputs from the player.
25 However, it will be understood that other arrangements are
   envisaged.  For example, an architecture may be provided
   wherein a gaming machine is networked to a gaming server
   and the respective functions of the gaming machine and the
   gaming server are selectively modifiable.       For example,
30 the gaming system may operate in stand alone gaming
   machine mode, "thick client" mode or "thin client" mode
   depending on the game being played, operating conditions,
   and so on. Other variations will be apparent to persons
   skilled in the art.
35
   Irrespective of the form, the gaming system comprises
   several core components. At the broadest level, the core
                                           10134011_1 (GHMatters) P74138.AU.5 3/04/18

                               - 9
   components are a player interface 50 and a game controller
   60 as illustrated in Figure 1. The player interface is
   arranged to enable manual interaction between a player and
   the gaming system and for this purpose includes the
 5 input/output components required for the player to enter
   instructions and play the game.
   Components of the player interface may vary from
   embodiment to embodiment but will typically include a
10 credit mechanism 52 to enable a player to input credits
   and receive payouts, one or more displays 54, a game play
   mechanism 56 comprised of one or more input devices that
   enable a player to input game play instructions                (e.g. to
   place bets),  and one or more speakers 58.
15
   The game controller 60 is in data communication with the
   player interface and typically includes a processor 62
   that processes the game play instructions in accordance
   with game play rules and outputs game play outcomes to the
20 display. Typically, the game play instructions are stored
   as program code in a memory 64 but can also be hardwired.
   Herein the term "processor" is used to refer generically
   to any device that can process game play instructions in
   accordance with game play rules and may include:                 a
25 microprocessor, microcontroller, programmable logic device
   or other computational device, a general purpose computer
    (e.g. a PC) or a server.
   A gaming system in the form of a stand alone gaming
30 machine 10 is illustrated in Figure 2. The gaming machine
   10 includes a console 12 having a display 14 on which are
   displayed representations of a game 16 that can be played
   by a player.   A mid-trim 20 of the gaming machine 10
   houses a bank of buttons 22 for enabling a player to
35 interact with the gaming machine, in particular during
   game play.   The mid-trim 20 also houses a credit input
   mechanism 24 which in this example includes a coin input
                                            10134011_1 (GHMatters) P74138.AU.5 3/04/18

                               - 10
   chute 24A and a bill collector 24B.    Other credit input
   mechanisms may also be employed, for example, a card
   reader for reading a smart card, debit card or credit
   card.   A player marketing module  (not shown) having a
 5 reading device may also be provided for the purpose of
   reading a player tracking device, for example as part of a
   loyalty program.   The player tracking device may be in the
   form of a card, flash drive or any other portable storage
   medium capable of being read by the reading device.
10 A top box 26 may carry artwork 28, including for example
   pay tables and details of bonus awards and other
   information or images relating to the game.            Further
   artwork and/or information may be provided on a front
   panel 29 of the console 12.    A coin tray 30 is mounted
15 beneath the front panel 29 for dispensing cash payouts
   from the gaming machine 10.
   The display 14 shown in Figure 2 is in the form of a video
   display unit, particularly a cathode ray tube screen
20 device.   Alternatively, the display 14 may be a liquid
   crystal display, plasma screen, any other suitable video
   display unit, or the visible portion of an
   electromechanical device.    The top box 26 may also include
   a display, for example a video display unit, which may be
25 of the same type as the display 14, or of a different
   type. It will be appreciated that the multiplier ball of
   the embodiment needs to be displayed on a video display,
   however, this could be on the main display 14 or a top box
   display. Hence, the multiplier ball could be used in
30 combination with a main display 14 formed by an
   electromechanical device, such as a set of stepper reels
   of a stepper gaming machine.
   Figure 3 shows a block diagram of operative components of
35 a typical gaming machine which may be the same as or
   different to the gaming machine of Figure 2.

   The gaming machine 100 includes a game controller 101
   having a processor 102.   Instructions and data to control
   operation of the processor 102 are stored in a memory 103,
   which is in data communication with the processor 102.
 5 Typically, the gaming machine 100 will include both
   volatile and non-volatile memory and more than one of each
   type of memory, with such memories being collectively
   represented by the memory 103.
10 The gaming machine has hardware meters 104 for purposes
   including ensuring regulatory compliance and monitoring
   player credit, an input/output (I/0) interface 105 for
   communicating with peripheral devices of the gaming
   machine 100.   The input/output interface 105 and/or the
15 peripheral devices may be intelligent devices with their
   own memory for storing associated instructions and data
   for use with the input/output interface or the peripheral
   devices.  A random number generator module 113 generates
   random numbers for use by the processor 102.            Persons
20 skilled in the art will appreciate that the reference to
   random numbers includes pseudo-random numbers.
   In the example shown in Figure 3, a player interface 120
   includes peripheral devices that communicate with the game
25 controller 101 comprise one or more displays 106, input
   devices in the form of a touch screen and/or buttons 107,
   a card and/or ticket reader 108, a printer 109, a bill
   acceptor and/or coin input mechanism 110 and a coin output
   mechanism 111.   Additional hardware may be included as
30 part of the gaming machine 100, or hardware may be omitted
   as required for the specific implementation. For example,
   other input devices known in the art to enable someone to
   interact with an electronic device may be employed.
35 In addition, the gaming machine 100 may include a
   communications interface, for example a network card 112.
   The network card may, for example, send status
                                            10134011_1 (GHMatters) P74138.AU.5 3/04/18

   information,  accounting information or other information
   to a central controller, server or database and receive
   data or commands from the central controller, server or
   database.

   Figure 4 shows a block diagram of the main components of
   an exemplary memory 103.   The memory 103 includes RAM
   103A, EPROM 103B and a mass storage device 103C.                   The RAM
   103A typically temporarily holds program files for
10 execution by the processor 102 and related data.                   The
   EPROM 103B may be a boot ROM device and/or may contain
   some system or game related code.   The mass storage device
   103C is typically used to store game programs, the
   integrity of which may be verified and/or authenticated by
15 the processor 102 using protected code from the EPROM 103B
   or elsewhere.
   It is also possible for the operative components of the
   gaming machine 100 to be distributed, for example
20 input/output devices 106,107,108,109,110,111 to be
   provided remotely from the game controller 101.
   Figure 5 shows a gaming system 200 in accordance with an
   alternative embodiment.   The gaming system 200 includes a
25 network 201, which for example may be an Ethernet network.
   Gaming machines 202, shown arranged in three banks 203 of
   two gaming machines 202 in Figure 5, are connected to the
   network 201.   The gaming machines 202 provide a player
   operable interface and may be the same as the gaming
30 machines 10,100 shown in Figures 2 and 3, or may have
   simplified functionality depending on the requirements for
   implementing game play.   While banks 203 of two gaming
   machines are illustrated in Figure 5, banks of one, three
   or more gaming machines are also envisaged.

   One or more displays 204 may also be connected to the
   network 201.   For example, the displays 204 may be
                                            10134011_1 (GHMatters) P74138.AU.5 3/04/18

                              - 13
   associated with one or more banks 203 of gaming machines.
   The displays 204 may be used to display representations
   associated with game play on the gaming machines 202,
   and/or used to display other representations, for example
 5 promotional or informational material.
   In a thick client embodiment, game server 205 implements
   part of the game played by a player using a gaming machine
   202 and the gaming machine 202 implements part of the
10 game. With this embodiment, as both the game server and
   the gaming device implement part of the game, they
   collectively provide a game controller. A database
   management server 206 may manage storage of game programs
   and associated data for downloading or access by the
15 gaming devices 202 in a database 206A. Typically, if the
   gaming system enables players to participate in a Jackpot
   game, a Jackpot server 207 will be provided to perform
   accounting functions for the Jackpot game.         A loyalty
   program server 212 may also be provided.
20
   In a thin client embodiment, game server 205 implements
   most or all of the game played by a player using a gaming
   machine 202 and the gaming machine 202 essentially
   provides only the player interface.   With this embodiment,
25 the game server 205 provides the game controller. The
   gaming machine will receive player instructions, pass
   these to the game server which will process them and
   return game play outcomes to the gaming machine for
   display.  In a thin client embodiment, the gaming machines
30 could be computer terminals, e.g. PCs running software
   that provides a player interface operable using standard
   computer input and output components.
   Servers are also typically provided to assist in the
35 administration of the gaming network 200, including for
   example a gaming floor management server 208, and a
   licensing server 209 to monitor the use of licenses
                                            10134011_1 (GHMatters) P74138.AU.5 3/04/18

                              - 14
   relating to particular games.   An administrator terminal
   210 is provided to allow an administrator to run the
   network 201 and the devices connected to the network.
 5 The gaming system 200 may communicate with other gaming
   systems, other local networks, for example a corporate
   network, and/or a wide area network such as the Internet,
   for example through a firewall 211.
10 Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that in
   accordance with known techniques, functionality at the
   server side of the network may be distributed over a
   plurality of different computers.   For example, elements
   may be run as a single "engine" on one server or a
15 separate server may be provided.   For example, the game
   server 205 could run a random generator engine.
   Alternatively, a separate random number generator server
   could be provided.  Further, persons skilled in the art
   will appreciate that a plurality of game servers could be
20 provided to run different games or a single game server
   may run a plurality of different games as required by the
   terminals.
   Persons skilled in the art will also appreciate that the
25 method of the preferred embodiment could be embodied in
   program code. The program code could be supplied in a
   number of ways, for example on a computer readable medium,
   such as a disc or a memory (for example, that could
   replace part of memory 103) or as a data signal (for
30 example, by downloading it from a server).
   A more detailed schematic view of a gaming system is shown
   in Figure 6 which shows that a number of modules are
   implemented by processor 62 based on program code stored
35 in memory 64. Persons skilled in the art will appreciate
   that other hardware/software implementations are possible.
                                            10134011_1 (GHMatters) P74138.AU.5 3/04/18

                               - 15
   In Figure 6, a player plays the game by entering currency
   with the credit mechanism which is converted to credits by
   game controller 60 and stored as credit data 647. The
   credit data will be modified in accordance with game play
 5 and in particular by wager instructions input with the
   game play mechanism 56 and the prizes evaluated by the
   prize evaluator 623.
   The exemplary gaming system    illustrated in Figure 6 is
10 off the type where an outcome generator generates game
   outcomes by selecting symbols with a symbol selector 621
   from symbol data 641 in accordance with a probability
   table based on a random number obtained from a random
   number generator 621. In an embodiment, the game may be a
15 spinning reel game where the symbols are the symbols on a
   plurality of reels. The prize outcomes are determined by
   the prize evaluator based on the player's win entitlement
    (which is based on the wager the player made) and the
   prize data 643. That is, certain game outcomes will be win
20 outcomes for the player.
   Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that a player's
   win entitlement will vary from game to game and may or may
   not be dependent on player selections. In most spinning
25 reel games, it is typical for the player's entitlement to
   be affected by the amount they wager and selections they
   wake  (i.e. the nature of the wager).  For example, a
   player's win entitlement may be based on how many lines
   they will play in each game - i.e. a minimum of one line
30 up to the maximum number of lines allowed by the game
    (noting that not all permutations of win lines may be
   available for selection. In many games, the player's win
   entitlement is not strictly limited to the lines they have
   selected, for example, "scatter" pays are awarded
35 independently of a players selection of pay lines and are
   an inherent part of the win entitlement.
                                             10134011_1 (GHMatters) P74138.AU.5 3/04/18

                               - 16
   Persons, skilled in the art, will appreciate that in other
   embodiments, the player may obtain a win entitlement by
   selecting a number of reels to play. Such games are
   marketed under the trade name "Reel Power" by Aristocrat
 5 Leisure Industries Pty Ltd. The selection of the reel
   means that each symbol of the reel can be substituted for
   a symbol at one or more designated display positions.
   In other embodiments a player win entitlement may be
   defined by purchasing access to particular pay tables
10 e.g. a first bet amount entitles the player to wins
   including cherries and a second amount entitles them to
   wins including plums.   The win entitlement is not always
   purchased - e.g. a series of free games may be awarded.
15 A win outcome is determined based on the selected symbols
   of a game outcome and a player's win entitlement and a pay
   table 643 that specifies awards.
   In embodiments of this invention, a win outcome is
20 modified by a win outcome modifier if a modification
   condition 648 is determined to be met by the modifier
   controller 624  , for example if the outcome generator 622
   generates an outcome that includes a designated symbol or
   symbol combination. In an embodiment, a modifier may be
25 determined each time a win outcome occurs. Modifiers may
   be, for example, absolute values or multipliers. The
   modifiers may include modifiers that do not change the win
   outcome  (particularly in embodiments where a modifier is
   always calculated).   A modifier may be determined in a one
30 stage or two stage process as described in further detail
   below. Once the modifier is determined and displayed to
   the player, the prize evaluator 623 modifies the prize
   outcome and updates credit data 647.  The player may redeem
   credits via the credit mechanism 52 or in other manners
35 known in the art, for example by printing a ticket having
   a face value corresponding to the number of credits that
   may be redeemed such that it can be taken to a cashier.
                                            10134011_1 (GHMatters) P74138.AU.5 3/04/18

                              - 17
   In most embodiments of this invention, the modifiers are
   displayed by an object such a spherical ball which is
 5 displayed as rotating and having a changing axis of
   rotation-i.e. which changes at least once and typically
   multiple times-until the object stops, whereafter the
   object controller controls the display such that the
   modifier selected by the modifier controller is apparent
10 for example by highlighting the modifier that is to be
   applied.
   In some embodiments, the object also moves by translation.
   This provides an advantageous way of displaying the
15 modifier. Display of the object by display controller 625
   is controlled by object controller 626 which controls the
   movement of the object based on object data 644 and
   includes and axis changer 626A - i.e. part of the control
   is to change the axis of rotation.
20
   In an embodiment, a composite modifier may be applied. In
   such an embodiment, a plurality of targets specified by
   target data 646 are displayed on display 54 and the object
   is displayed as moving by translation relative to the
25 targets. Each target has an associated further modifier
   and a target is randomly selected by the modifier
   controller such that the modifier on the object and the
   modifier on the target are combined to form a composite
   modifier which is applied by the prize evaluator 623. The
30 further modifier may have the effect of adding to the
   object modifier, negating the object modifier (e.g. a zero
   multiplier) or making no difference (e.g. a one times
   multiplier). It will be appreciated that in this
   embodiment, while the effect of the object, such as a
35 ball, rotating around a changing axis is particularly
   advantageous, the object need not spin relative to the
   target while providing the advantageous effect of the
                                           10134011_1 (GHMatters) P74138.AU.5 3/04/18

                               - 18
   modifier being indicated partly by the object and partly
   by the target.
   Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that while it
 5 is described above that the modifiers of the target and
   object are determined independently, they could be
   determine as a single modifier which is then split between
   the object and the target.
10 Figure 9 summarises the method 900 of one embodiment. The
   method 900 involves generating 910 a game outcome and
   determining 920 whether it is a winning outcome. For
   winning outcomes 930 it is determined whether to generate
   a modifier, for example, for specific outcomes. When a
15 modifier is to be applied, the display is controlled 940
   such that the object is displayed with a changing object
   of rotation. The displayed modifier modifies 950 the win
   outcome.
20 Figure 10 summarises the method 1000 of another
   embodiment. The method 1000 involves generating 910 a game
   outcome and determining 1020 whether it is a winning
   outcome. For winning outcomes 1030 it is determined
   whether to generate a modifier, for example, for specific
25 outcomes. When a modifier is to be applied, the display is
   controlled 1040 such that the object is displayed as
   moving relative to a plurality of targets. The displayed
   modifier modifies 1050 the win outcome.
30 Further features of the above methods will be apparent
   from the above description of the gaming system and the
   below examples. Persons skilled in the art will also
   appreciate that the method could be embodied in program
   code. The program code could be supplied in a number of
35 ways, for example on a computer readable medium, such as a
   disc or a memory  (for example, that could replace part of
   memory 103) or as a data signal  (for example, by
                                            10134011_1 (GHMatters) P74138.AU.5 3/04/18

   downloading it from a server).
   Examples
 5 Example 1
   In a first example, shown the exemplary displays of figure
   7A to 7D.   The ball is initially displayed at rest in a
   first position 710A within an aperture 720.            From this
10 first display 700A, it will be seen that there are a
   plurality of different regions on the ball which
   correspond to different modifiers, which in these examples
   are multipliers.   The multipliers visible in Figure 7A are
   a x2 and a x50 multiplier.    The shapes of the regions are
15 not of particular importance, however, it is assistance if
   they can be distinguished by either borders or different
   colours designating different multipliers.
   In Figure 7B there is shown a further display 700B where
20 the ball is shown as spinning within the aperture 720 such
   that the multipliers cannot readily be perceived.                      The
   spinning is such that the axis of rotation changes at
   least once.
25 Figure 7C shows a further view where the ball has stopped
   at a stop position 710C with a 2x multiplier 715 at the
   centre of the ball to indicate that this is the multiplier
   that will apply.
30 In Figure 7D, it is shown that the object controller
   controls the display of the object to further highlight
   that the x2 multiplier 715 applies by narrowing the
   aperture 720A and highlighting 725 the x2 multiplier.
35 Example 2
   In the second example, the multiplier ball 830 is
                                             10134011_1 (GHMatters) P74138.AU.5 3/04/18

                              - 20
   displayed as moving by spinning and translating behind a
   screen 805 which has a number of slots therein 810 to 815
   which provide a six different target 810 to 815 associated
   with six different modifiers 820 to 825.       From the
 5 modifiers shown in the exemplary display 800A, it is seen
   that the modifier can be a multiplier as indicated by
   items 820 to 822 or an alternative prize as indicated by
   items 823 to 825 which correspond to different jackpot
   levels.  That is, in this example, the prize can be
10 modified by being replaced with a jackpot prize or
   supplemented by a jackpot prize.
   Referring now to Figure 8B, it will be seen that the ball
   830 has come to a stop position where the 2x multiplier
15 835 is displayed within slot 812 indicating that a total
   multiplier of x30 (i.e. 2x15) will apply to the prize and
   needs to be implemented by the prize evaluator 623.
   It will be apparent that the roaming object in this
20 example could also be a dice, a coin  (with either win or
   no win) or any other object. A "no win" target could also
   be added- i.e. effectively a negating modifier.
   It will also be apparent that this target embodiment can
25 be employed with an object that does not spin - i.e. in a
   variant where the novel display effect is provided by
   combining a target having a first modifier and a moving
   object having a second modifier from which a composite
   modifier is apparent on the display.
30
   It will be understood to persons skilled in the art of the
   invention that many modifications may be made without
   departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. In
   particular, that features of the above embodiments and
35 examples may be combined to form further embodiments.
   It is to be understood that, if any prior art publication
                                            1013401 1_1 (GHMatters) P74138.AU.5 3/04/18
