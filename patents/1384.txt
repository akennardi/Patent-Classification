excavators, include crawler mechanisms for moving the machine over the ground.
The crawler mechanism includes an articulated track composed of multiple links
or shoes coupled together to form a continuous loop.                 The shoes engage the
ground and engage a row of rollers along a roller path as the track is driven. The
weight of the machine and any loads supported by the machine are transmitted
through the rollers to the shoes, thereby causing the shoes to wear down and/or
deform over time.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0024]              FIG. 1 illustrates an earthmoving machine, such as a mining shovel 10,
including a frame 14 supporting a boom 26, an elongated member or handle 30,
and an attachment or dipper 34 coupled to the handle 30. The frame 14 includes
an upper portion 16 that is supported by an undercarriage 18 having crawlers 22.
The upper portion 16 supports a hoist drum (not shown) for reeling in and paying
out a cable or hoist rope 42. The boom 26 includes a first end 46 coupled to the
upper portion 16 of the frame 14, a second end 50 opposite the first end 46, a
boom sheave 54, a saddle block 58, and a shipper shaft 62. The boom sheave 54
is coupled to the second end 50 of the boom 26 and guides the rope 42 over the
second end 50. The saddle block 58 is rotatably coupled to the boom 26 by the
shipper shaft 62, which is positioned between the first end 46 and the second end
50 of the boom 26.                The shipper shaft 62 extends through the boom 26 in a
direction that is transverse to a longitudinal axis of the boom 26. The hoist rope
42 is coupled to the dipper 34 by a bail 66, and the dipper 34 is raised or lowered
as the hoist rope 42 is reeled in or paid out, respectively, by the hoist drum.
[0025]               The handle 30 includes a first end 82 and a second end 86. The second
end 86 is movably received in the saddle block 58, and the handle 30 passes
9817833_1 (GHMatters) P98571.AU.1

                                                6
through the saddle block 58 such that the handle 30 is capable of rotational and
translational movement relative to the boom 26. The saddle block 58 is rotatable
relative to the boom 26 about the shipper shaft 62, and the handle 30 rotates
relative to the boom 26 while the handle 30 remains in the saddle block 58.
[0026]              As shown in FIGS. 2 and 3, each crawler 22 includes a track frame 90
and a track 92 including links or shoes 94 coupled together to form an articulated,
continuous loop. The track frame 90 includes a first end 98, a second end 102, a
first or lower portion 106, and a second or upper portion 110. In the illustrated
embodiment, a first sprocket 114 (FIG. 2) is supported for rotation at the first end
98, and a second sprocket 118 (FIG. 3) is supported for rotation at the second end
 102 of the frame 90. At least one of the sprockets 114, 118 is driven by a motor
(not shown). The sprockets 114, 118 engage the crawler shoes 94 (e.g., by teeth
extending into spaces between the shoes 94), thereby driving the shoes 94 around
the perimeter of the track frame 90 in a continuous loop. The track 92 defines a
first or lower run proximate the ground and a second or upper run extending along
the upper portion 110 of the frame 90. As the shoes 94 move along the lower run,
the shoes 94 engage the ground to move the machine 10 with respect to the
ground.
[00271                 As shown in FIGS. 3 and 4, rollers 126 are rotatably coupled to the
lower side 106 of the frame 90. The rollers 126 are aligned with one another such
that all of the rollers 126 rotate in a common plane. Stated another way, the
rollers 126 are aligned along a direction of travel 120 (FIG. 4) of the shoes 94. As
shown in FIG. 5, each roller 126 is supported for rotation about a pin 128 defining
an axis of rotation perpendicular to the direction of travel of the shoes 94. In the
illustrated embodiment, a thrust washer 132 is positioned between the outer
surface of the pin 128 and the inner bore of the 126.
[0028]              Referring now to FIG. 6, each shoe 94 includes a first end 130, a
second end 134, and an intermediate portion 138 positioned between the first end
 130 and the second end 134.             The shoes 94 are driven in a direction that is
generally perpendicular to a line drawn between the first end 130 and the second
9817833_1 (GHMatters) P98571.AU.1

                                                   7
end 134. The intermediate portion 138 includes a wear surface or roller path area
 142 that contacts the rollers 126 as the shoes 94 are driven along the lower run of
the track 92. The weight of the machine and any other loads supported by the
machine 10 are transmitted through the rollers 126 to the shoes 94 in the lower
run. In one embodiment, the compressive load exerted on the shoes 94 by the
rollers 126 work hardens the shoes 94 at least during a predetermined period after
installation of the shoes 94.
[0029]              In one embodiment, the shoes 94 are formed from manganese or a
manganese alloy and undergo a period of work hardening to increase the hardness
of the shoes 94 to a desired level. In one embodiment, the contact between the
rollers 126 and the roller path area 142 of each crawler shoe 94 work-hardens the
shoe 94 during a period of operation after the shoe 94 is installed. The shoes 94
are work-hardened by the roller 126 where the primary loads are exerted, causing
the shoes 94 to attain a higher hardness and thereby extending the overall life of
the crawler 22 and its components.               In one embodiment, the work hardening
period for each shoe 94 takes place during the first 200-300 hours of operation on
the crawler shoe 94.
[0030]              FIG. 7 illustrates a guide rail assembly 150 extending along an upper
portion 110 of the track frame 90. In the illustrated embodiment, the guide rail
assembly 150 includes multiple rail portions 154. In one embodiment, the track
frame 90 includes four rail portions 154. In other embodiments, the track frame
90 may include fewer or more rail portions 154, and the rail portions 154 may be
coupled to the track frame 90 in a different manner. Each rail portion 154 has an
elongated shape and is aligned such that a longitudinal axis of the rail portion 154
is parallel to the direction of travel of the shoes 94. Stated another way, the rail
portions 154 are aligned in an end-to-end configuration such that all of the rail
portions 154 extend along a common plane. In the illustrated embodiment, each
rail portion 154 is independently coupled to the upper portion 110 of the track
frame 90 (e.g., by a bolted connection) such that each rail portion 154 can be
removed and replaced without requiring disassembly of any adjacent rail portions
9817833_1 (GHMatters) P98571.AU.1

                                                8
 154. In other embodiments, the guide rail assembly 150 may be coupled to the
frame 90 in a different manner.
[0031]              Referring now to FIGS. 8 and 9, each guide rail portion 154 includes a
base 162 defining an outer surface 166 and a coating 170 coupled to the outer
surface 166. In one embodiment, the coating 170 is a polymer-blend bonded to
the outer surface 166, the coating 170 follows the same profile as the rail portion
 154, and has a uniform, predetermined thickness. The coating 170 is bonded to
the base 162 such that the bond is stronger than the coating 170 itself, and the
coating 170 mimics the specialized profile of the base 162.                      In other
embodiments, the coating 170 may also be attached mechanically by forming
various features (e.g., small holes, recesses, and/or grooves) on the outer surface
 166 in order to provide a stronger attachment between the coating 170 and the
base 162.
[0032]              In one embodiment, the coating 170 is formed from polyurethane. In
one embodiment, the coating 170 is formed from KAS 311005D polyurethane. In
one embodiment, the coating 170 is formed from Type 6M Nylon.                       In one
embodiment, the coating 170 is formed from a Teflon polymer.                       In one
embodiment, the coating 170 is formed from a polyurethane (which may include
KAS 311005D) impregnated with a lubricative medium.
[0033]              Referring again to FIG. 3, the guide rail assembly 150 engages the
roller path area 142 of the shoes 94 as the shoes 94 are driven along the upper run
of the track 92. The selection of the coating material at least partially depends on
the loads and conditions to which the shoe 94 is subjected. The coating material
provides a low coefficient of friction and lower hardness than the crawler shoe 94,
even before the shoe 94 is completely work-hardened. The coating 170 provides
lubricative engagement between the shoe 94 and the rail portion 154, reducing
wear on the crawler shoe's roller path area 142 during the work-hardening period.
The coating 170 has a life that matches or exceeds the work-hardening period
such that, if the coating 170 were to wear off, the outer surface 166 of the base
9817833_1 (GHMatters) P98571.AU.1

                                                   9
 162 would support the crawler shoes 94 after the shoes 94 have achieved a
hardness exceeding the hardness of the base 162.
[0034]              Furthermore, the coating 170 may be configured to significantly
exceed the work-hardening period in order to decrease friction between the guide
rail assembly 150 and the shoes 94, thereby facilitating more efficient operation of
the track 92. In addition, many shoes 94 are also made of a manganese alloy
having a similar hardness to the base 162 of the rail portions 154. Even after the
shoe 94 is work-hardened, the wear rate of the shoe 94 is proportional to the
hardness of the shoe 94 and the base 162 of the rail portion 154. Thus, providing
a coating 170 having a lower hardness reduces the wear on the crawler shoe 94
and reduces the frequency of replacing shoes 94.
[0035]              FIGS. 10 and 11 illustrate another embodiment of the shoe 494 in
which the roller path area 542 includes a surface 572 (FIG. 11) and a plurality of
peening pads or protrusions 574 (FIG. 11) extending outwardly from the surface
572. As the rollers 126 exert a compressive force on the roller path area 542, the
protrusions 574 wear down, thereby facilitating material flow and work hardening
of the shoe 494. In addition, the roller path area 542 is formed as a parallelogram,
including a leading edge forming an acute angle relative to a front edge of the
shoe 94 and a trailing edge parallel to the leading edge and forming an acute angle
relative to a rear edge of the shoe 494. The structure of the shoe 494 is described
in U.S. Patent Application Ser. No. 14/285,255, filed May 22, 2014, the entire
contents of which is hereby incorporated by reference.
[0036]               Similarly, FIG. 12 illustrates another embodiment of the shoe 894 in
which the roller path area 942 includes a surface 972, ridges 974 extending
outwardly from the surface 972 and parallel to the direction of travel, and
protrusions 976 extending outwardly from the surface 972 and positioned between
the ridges 974.
[0037]              In other embodiments, a similar coating to the coating 170 on the
guide rail assembly 150 may also be applied to the outer surface of the pins 128
9817833_1 (GHMatters) P98571.AU.1

                                                 10
(FIG. 5) supporting the rollers 126. In other embodiments, the thrust washer 132
between the pin 128 and the roller 126 may be formed from a nylon material.
[0038]               Thus, the invention may provide, among other things, a guide rail for a
crawler track. Although the invention has been described in detail with reference
to certain independent embodiments, variations and modifications exist within the
scope and spirit of one or more independent aspects of the invention as described.
[0039]              In the claims which follow and in the preceding description of the
invention, except where the context requires otherwise due to express language or
necessary implication, the word "comprise" or variations such as "comprises" or
"comprising" is used in an inclusive sense, i.e. to specify the presence of the
stated features but not to preclude the presence or addition of further features in
various embodiments of the invention.
