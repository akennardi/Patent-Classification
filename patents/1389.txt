20 cytotoxicity values towards uncontrollably proliferative cells by inducing apoptosis irrespective
   of cells' p53 status, without being cytotoxic to normal cells.
   BACKGROUND ART
    It is well known in the art that the majority of cytotoxic cancer chemotherapeutic agents act in
   a relatively indiscriminate manner. The effectiveness of agents such as cyclophosphamide,
25 cis-platinum and adriamycin is a consequence of DNA alkylation, DNA-repair defects and
   elevated DNA topoisomerase II levels, respectively, in susceptible cancer cell types. However
   these features, though highly significant for the positive clinical outcomes sometimes seen
   with these agents, are thus required to be counter-balanced by their high toxicity and
   generation of resistance mechanisms (Current Opinion in Chemical Biology 2009, 13:345
30 353).
   Alterations of signal transduction pathways leading to uncontrolled cellular proliferation,
   survival, invasion, and metastases are hallmarks of the carcinogenic process. Protein
   Kinases are considered to be key regulators of these signal transduction pathways. It is
   becoming increasingly evident that many of these aberrations converge on a few key
                                                                      1

       WO 2014/049619                                                           PCT/AN2013/000593
    pathways involved in cancer cell signal transduction, including the phosphatidylinositol 3
    kinase (PI3K)/AKT/mammalian       target of rapamycin (mTOR)        and the Raf/mitogen
   -activated and extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (MEK)/extracellular signal
    regulated kinase (ERK) cascades. Both these pathways play important roles in normal
 5  cellular physiology; the carcinogenic process exploits and uses these same pathways to
    convey constitutively active survival signals to the nucleus. Deregulation of kinase
    activity has emerged as a major mechanism by which cancer cells evade normal
    physiological constraints on growth and survival (Cancer Treatment Reviews 39 (2013)
    935-946).
10  Hence, over the past decade the development of anti-cancer drugs has undergone
    crucial changes. Whereas conventional chemotherapy targets both normal and rapidly
    dividing cells, newer agents tend to exploit tumor-specific alterations in DNA or in signal
    transduction pathways.
    One of the approach might be to target specific DNA sequences that may combine high
15  target selectivity with the prospect of developing small-drug-like molecules. This entails
    the targeting of DNA sequence motifs that fold into four-stranded structures called G
    quadruplexes. Accumulating evidence has suggested the existence of the G-quadruplex
    conformation for telomeric DNA sequences both in vitro and in vivo.
    Telomeres are DNA-protein complex, which are non-coding highly repetitive sequences
20  located at the 3' end region of the chromosomes consisting of almost 200 nucleotides
    constituted by tandem repeats of hexanucleotide (TTAGGG)L and finishes as an over
    hanging single strand that provide protection against gene erosion at cell divisions,
    chromosomal non-homologous end-joining and nuclease attacks. The telomeres have a
    vital role for life as because of   =wide  functioning with telomere associated proteins,
25  attachment to the nuclear matrix, and higher order chromatin structures (Collado et al,
    2007; Campbell, 2012). Conservation of telomeric length is an important biological
    condition for cell growth (Engelhardt & Finke, 2001; Lange, 2009). Telomeric DNA in
    vertebrates consists of tandem repeats of hexanucleotide sequence, d(TTAGGG). The G
    rich single stranded sequence at the 3'-end of telomeric. DNA can adopt varying tertiary
30  structures including G-Quadruplexes. After each cell division, the telomere sequence
    gets shortened and that leads.to halting of cell division (senescence) and eventually
    controlled cell death (apoptosis)      takes place. Telomerase      is the enzyme which
    functionalizes the addition of hexanucleotide repeats of TTAGGG to the 3rend of
    telomere and it's Maintenance during normal cell division (mitosis). Unusual over
35  expression of telomerase enzyme engineers massive extension of telomeric ends and
                                                  2

      WO 2014/049619                                                            PCT/INl2013/000593
   brings in anomalous cell proliferation, which causes cancer. Moreover, it has also been
   demonstrated that in 85% of cancer cells telomerase is over expressed, which prevents
   natural shortening of telomere and leads to cell proliferation.
 5 Telomeres and telomerase are thus also known to be attractive therapeutic targets in
   cancer because telomerase is found to be expressed in 80-85% of cancer cells and
   primary tumours, but not in normal somatic cells.
   Telomeres     are  the  main  location which   forms   such crucial  functional  secondary
10 structures of DNA comprising of a 3-end region of chromosomes consists of almost 200
   nucleotides constituted by tandem repeats of hexanucleotide (TTAGGG), and finishes as
   an over-hanging single strand.- The overhang G-rich repetitive DNA units at 3'-end of
   telomeres can form various tertiary structures including G-Quadruplex where the
   guanine bases stack over each other and were stabilized by cyclic Hoogesteen type of
15 hydrogen-bonding (Dai & Carver., 2007; Luu et al., 2008; Burge et al., 2006; Dai &
   Punchihewa,     2007). The most promising fact of the G-Quadruplex structure is its
   topology, which cannot be recognized by the single-stranded RNA component of
   telomerase enzyme. On the contrary it can be recognized by itself as a damage signal of
   DNA and therefore can invoke apoptosis (Rodriguez et al., 2008).
20 Though inhibition of telomerase action is an efficient Way to tune back cancer cells for
   natural cell death, one prominent emerging strategy for telomerase inhibition Is the
   stabilization of G-Quadruplex structures of telomeric DNA, thus preventing its availability
   as a primer for telomerase assisted elongation whereby telomerase activity would be
   down regulated to bring in apoptosis in cancerous cells.
25 Quarfloxin (or Quarfloxacin) is known as a fluoroquinolone derivative with antineoplastic
   activity. Quarfloxin disrupts the interaction between the nucleolin protein and a G
   quadruplex DNA structure in the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) template, a critical interaction
   for rRNA biogenesis that is overexpressed in cancer cells; disruption of this G-quadruplex
   DNA:protein interaction in aberrant rRNA biogenesis may result in the inhibition of
30 ribosome synthesis and tumor cell apoptosis.
   Only very few of the previously investigated compounds in the art have shown specific
   inhibition of telomerase using nanomolar concentration reflected in their IC50 values and
   therefore, there still remains a need in the art to explore for selective molecules that
   would have high binding selectivity towards the intramolecular G-Quadruplex structures
                                                3

         WO 2014/049619                                                            PCT/INl2013/000593
       of telomere over a DNA duplex structure or other potential quadruplex forming
       sequences in the genome that would effectively stabilize the said G-Quadruplex
       structures of telomere in minimum effective concentrations at which concentration or
       dose it would kill more than 50% of cancerous cells but not be cytotoxic to normal cells.
   5
       Quite interestingly, there is now a growing body of work that has explored a hypothesis
       that links the existence of G-quadruplex-forming sequences in promoters of oncogenes
       including that of kinases. Thus, discovery of Quadruplex stabilizers which bind to
       promoter regions of oncogenes thereby inbiting their transcription is quite relevant to
 10    cancer therapeutics (Current Opinion in Chemical Biology 2009, 13:345-353).
       Further, it is also known in the art that in more than 50% of the cancers, p53 (tumor
       suppressor protein) is mutated and many existing chemotherapeutic drugs are found to
       be ineffective in p53 mutated cancers and hence it is also a major challenge of the day
 15   to develop antl-cancer agents that can kill cancer cells with non-functional p53.

     also be prepared in glycerol, liquid polyethylene glycols, triacetin, and mixtures thereof.
    Various embodiments of the present invention are described below. The present
     invention encompasses other compounds having formula I and is not limited to the
 10 specific combinations of substituents described in various embodiments below.
    The water soluble form of M2 is obtained through lowering of pH and protonation with
    the help of acids and then adjusting the pH with sodium or potassium bicarbonate to 7.0.
    The lowering of pH and protonation can be done using acids selected from HCI, H-12SO4,

    The above said water soluble cancer therapeutic agents/formulations comprising M2 of
    the present invention and the molecular. frameworks derived out of the said molecule is
    found to possess said cancer therapeutic activity under minimum effective
20  concentrations at which concentration or dose it effectively kills more than 50% of
    cancerous cells and are also advantageously not cytotoxic to normal cells, wherein such
    selective strong binding is irrespective of the cell's p53 (tumor suppressor protein)
    status.
25  In another preferred embodiment of the present invention said water soluble cancer
    chemotherapeutic/    kinase suppressors agent/formulations involving the same also
    possesses favourable cytotoxicity values independent of the cell's p53 status set to
    favourably prevent uncontrolled proliferation of cells. It is known that in more than 50%
    of the cancers, p53 is mutated and many existing chemotherapeutic drugs are found to
30  be ineffective in p53 mutated cancers. It is a major challenge, thus, to develop anti
    cancer agents that can kill cancer cells with non-functional p53. As evident from the
    examples, this novel compound M2 in the range of 15-40 pM / 0.4974 mg/kg-1.3264
    mg/kg of body weight and the water soluble form of M2, Form II have a great potential
    as an antFcancer agent whose cytotoxIcIty Is not dependent on the cell's p53 status.

     The anti-proliferative effect of water soluble M2 which can be extended as anti-tumor
     activity are also studied in vitro and in vivo following the procedures as mentioned
     hereunder:
  5
     EXAMPLE I: Protonation of M2 to make it soluble.
     M2 is not soluble in water at pH 7.0 in its ordinary form. When it is protonated using
     0.1M HCI, it gets solubilized. Just after that the pH is adjusted by addition of sodium or
     potassium bi carbonate to keep the soluble form of M2 at pH 7.0. The protonation is very
10   much important to generate protonated M2 (form II) which is a new species that is
     soluble in water and used for other experimental studies.

    All the subsequent examples cited below were performed with water soluble form of M2.
15  EXAMPLE II: In vitro study
    (A) Cytotoxicity studies of M2 against human peripheral blood mononuclear
    cells (PBMC).
    The toxicity of M2 was tested against human PBMC. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells
    (PBMC)     were isolated from        normal human  blood and were          maintained in RPMI
20  supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 pg/ml streptomycin and 50 units/ml penicillin, at 37 0 C
    in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2 . For experiments, required numbers of cells
    (106) were plated with 2% serum and then the experiments were performed where a
    series of concentrations of M2 was administered in human PBMC and after 12 hours, cell
    viability was assessed. The doses that were tested ranged between 0.5433x10 7 pM to
                                                   23

   35pM. Out of these, 35pM (which is the highest dose used) concentration was found to
   be toxic as ~25% PSMC could not survive this treatment.
   During the next phase, some doses from the previous set of experiments were selected
   and cytotoxicity assay was once again carried out with these selected doses against
 5 human PBMC. This time a concentration ranging between 0.1 to 30 pM were selected.
   Once again doses 0.1 to 25 pM were found to have negligible effect on the viability of
   human PBMC. However, the highest dose (30 M) was found to exert cytotoxic effect on
   human PBMC (Table 1). Apart from cell viability assay, the genotoxicity of the different
   concentrations of compound against human PBMC was also tested by alkaline single cell
10 gel electrophoresis assay. In accordance with the cytotoxicity data, there was. no
   significant comet formation with any of the doses except the 30 pM dose. Survivability of
   the cells at varying concentrations of the compound was tabulated as mean + Standard
   Deviation of five independent experiments.

   Cancer cell lines with functional or disrupted p53 expression were maintained in ATCC
20 recommended culture media supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 pg/mI streptomycin and
   50 units/ml penicillin, at 370C in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO 2. For

   From the above table (Table2) it is clear that the compound showed a dose-dependent
   increase in cytotoxicity in all the 5 cancer cell lines tested. Interestingly, the highest
10 mortality in each of the three concentrations was observed in the p53 mutated breast
   cancer cell line with the highest dose exhibiting 60% cell death. However, the
   cytotoxicity in the cervical cancer cell line having disrupted p53 function was comparable
   to that of the p53 wild type cell lines. From this cytotoxicity data on a series of cancer
   cell lines, it can be hypothesized that unlike many chemotherapeutic drugs, this
15 compound can exert its cytotoxic effect on cancer cells irrespective of the cell's p53
   status. Another point of interest in the above cytotoxicity data is that between the'two

   exposure with the compound at varying concentrations and cell cycle phase distribution

   binding fluorochrome.
   Results (vide table below) show a dose dependent increase in the sub-GO peak with the
15 treatment doses indicating cell death. Thus, it is clear that the compound was able to
   induce apoptosis even in the absence of p53. However, the percentage of cells in the S
   G2-M phase, which is the proliferative phase, was found to be lowest in the 15 pM dose

    From the above in vitro study it is evident that M2 in its soluble form shows anticancer
    property within the range 15 pM -25 pM without being cytotoxic to normal cells. 30pM
    was found to exert cytotoxic effect on human PBMC. Thus for study the effect in vivo,
10  the range was selected from 15 pM to 40 pM. The lower end was selected 15 pM since
    below that level the anticancer activity was not very significant whereas the upper end
    was selected 40 pM to check its anticancer activity alongwith cytotoxic activity towards
    normal cells.
15  For in vivo anticancer activity parameters to be studied and techniques to be
    used are noted hereunder:
    Cell Viability Assay
    The cytotoxicity of the water soluble M2 at different doses was tested on the proliferation
20  of tumor cells by the Trypan Blue exclusion method. Cells were harvested from the
    sarcoma tissue and a single cell suspension was made. Those cells that could exclude the
    Trypan blue dye were counted in haemocytometer as viable cells.
    Measurement of tumor weight and volume

       The antitumor activity was assessed by measuring the change in tumor volume and
       tumor weight. Changes in tumor size over time after tumor transplantation was assessed
       in all the experimental groups. The length and width of the tumor were measured using
       digital calipers. Tumor volume was calculated by the following formula;
   5   Tumor volume       (mm3):  C.5x a x b2 where a is the largest diameter and b its
       perpendicular.
      Dissection and Tissue collection
       All the mice were euthanized after the last dose of M2 treatment on the 21st day. Liver
       and tumor tissues of the animals from all the experimental groups were collected,
 10    washed in 0.9% saline, soaked in filter paper and processed for cellular, biochemical,
       histological and immunohistochemical studies. Femurs were also aseptically removed;
      bone marrow was flushed with a 26 gauge needle and suspended in RPMI for cell count
      and cell cycle analysis.
      Tumor and Bone Marrow cell count
 15   Cells from tumor tissue were harvested and a single cell suspension was prepared in
      RPMI supplemented with EDTA and collagenase. A single cell suspension of the bone
      marrow was made with repeated aspiration. The cells- were resuspended in RPMI-1640.
      The viable tumor and bone marrow cells were counted in a haemocytometer by the
      Trypan Blue exclusion method.
20    Tumor and Bone Marrow Cell cycle distribution analysis
      For the determination of cell cycle phase distribution of nuclear DNA, cells from bone
      marrow and tumor tissue (1x10 6 cells) were harvested from tumor bearing untreated
      and treated mice. After making a single cell suspension, cells were fixed with 3% p
     formaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100, and nuclear DNA was labelled with
25   propidium iodide (PI, 125 pg/ml) after RNase treatment using Cycle TEST PLUS DNA
     reagent kit. Cell cycle phase distribution of nuclear DNA was determined on FACS Calibur
     using Cell Quest Software (Becton-Dickinson Histogram display of DNA content (x-axis,
     PI fluorescence) versus counts (y-axis) has been displayed. Cell Quest statistics was
     employed to quantitate the data at different phases of the cell cycle.
30   Detection of Apoptosis
     Single Cell Gel Electrophoresis (Comet assay) was performed in sarcoma cells to study.
     the induction of apoptosis by M2. Comet assay is a sensitive, reliable, and rapid method

   for DNA damage evaluation. The segmented DNA emigrates from the nucleus towards
   the anode under an electrical current to produce comets. About 400 pl of the cell
   suspension was mixed with 800 pl 1% low melting point agarose. Then 100 p1 of the
   mixture was layered on slides precoated with a 1% normal melting point agarose and
 5 then covered with a cover slip. The slides were then placed in a refrigerator for 5 min.
   Then cover slips were carefully removed and the. slides were left in a dark place except
   for the positive control slides. The positive control slides were treated with 200 pM H2 0 2
   solution for 17 min at 4*C, while the negative control slides remained untreated. Then all
   the slides were immersed in cold lysis solution (2.5 M NaCI, 100 mM EDTA, 0.2 .N NaOH,
10 10 mM Tris, 1% Triton X-100, p-=10), protected from light and refrigerated at 40 C for
   45 min. Slides were then left in freshly prepared electrophoresis solution (0.3 M NaOH, 1
   mM EDTA, pH> 13,) for 40 min. Electrophoresis was performed using the same solution
   at 300 mA, 25 V for 45 min. After electrophoresis the slides were neutralized gently with
   0.4 M Tris buffer at pH 7.5 for 10 min and stained with 20 pg/mI ethidium bromide for 7
15 min. Slides were washed and then dried. Two slides were used for each sample and
   photos were taken from at least 100 cells (50 cells for each slide) using a fluorescent
   microscope at 400 magnifications. Cells without DNA damage retained a circular
   appearance. During electrophoresis, DNA with strand breaks migrated toward the anode,
   giving the cell a "comet" appearance. Comets were counted in four to five different fields
20 of a section, and data are summarized in terms of percent comet. Every experiment was
   repeated thrice.

   Measurement of Oxidative Stress Biomarkers
   Preparation of liver and tumor tissue
   400mg of liver and tumor liver tissue were homogenized in 1.15% KCL. The homogenate
   was then centrifuged at 10,000g at 40 C for 20 mins. The clear supernatant collected was
30 used for quantitative estimation of lipid peroxidation (LPO),         superoxide dismutase
   (SOD), catalase (CAT), Glutathione-S-Transferase (GST) and protein (Lowry et al., J.
   Bio. Chem, 193, 265-275, 1951).

   The extent of LPO in the bone marrow            and liver homogenates was determined
   quantitatively by performing the method as described by Ohkawa et al (Anal. Biochem,
   95, 351-358, 1979). The amount of malondiaidehyde was measured by reaction with
   thiobarbituric acid at 532 nim using spectrophotometer. MDA levels were calculated using
 S the standard curve of malondialdehyde and its level expressed in nM/mg of protein.
   Assay of Anti-oxidant enzymes
   CAT (Please provide full form) Acitivity
   CAT activity was assessed by the method of Luck (Methods of Enzymatic Analysis,
   Academic Press, New York, pp. 895-897, 1963), wherein the breakdown of H2O2 is
10 measured. Briefly, assay mixture consists of 3 mL of H20 2 phosphate buffer and 0.05'mL
   of the supernatant of the tissue homogenate. The change in absorbance was recorded
   for 2 min at 30s interval at 240 nm using spectrophotometer.
   Super-oxide dismutase (SOD) Acitivity
   SOD activity was assayed by the method of Marklund et al (Eur. J. Biochem, 47, 469
15 474, 1974) based on pyrogallol auto oxidation inhibition and expressed as unit/mg of
   protein. One unit of enzyme activity is defined as the amount of enzyme necessary for
   inhibiting the reaction by 50%. Auto oxidation of Pyrogallol in Tris-HCL buffer (50 mM,
   pH 7.5) is measured by increase in absorbance at 420 nm.
   Glutathione S-transferase (GST) Activity
20 GST activities were      measured in tissue cytosol. by determining      the increase in
   absorbance at 340nm with 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB) as the substrate and the
   specific activity of the enzyme was expressed as formation of CDNB-GSH conjugate per
   minute per milligram protein (1. BloL Chem. 249, 7130-7139, 1974).
   Western blot analysis
25 Cell lysates were obtained and equal amounts of protein from each sample were diluted
   with   loading buffer, denatured, and separated by 10%          sodium dodecyl sulfate
   polyacrylamide     gel  electrophoresis  (SDS-PAGE)    followed by   protein  transfer  to
   polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (PVDF). The effect of M2 treatment on the expression
   of certain cell cycle proteins such as p53, p21 and PCNA, ERK3 and on Nrf-2, the
30 regulator of cellular anti-oxidant response was determined. Proteins were detected by
   Incubation with corresponding primary antibodies (anti p53, anti-p21, anti-Nrf-2,anti
   ERK3 and anti-PCNA) antibodies followed by blotting with AP-conjugated secondary

   was performed three times.
   Statistical analysis
   The experiments were repeated three times and the data were analyzed statically.
 5 Values have been shown as standard error of mean, except where otherwise indicated.
   Data were analyzed and, when appropriate, significance of the differences between mean
   values was determined by Student's t test. Results were considered significant at p <
   0.05.
10 EXAMPLE III: In vivo study
   After confirming its anti-cancer effect in vitro, the in vivo effect of M2 was further tested
   in a murine transplantable solid tumor model, Sarcoma-180.
   Animals: Male Swiss albino mice, (obtained from animal colony of our Institution)
   strains will be maintained in plastic cages (~4 mice / cage) at an ambient temperature
15 of 22-25 0 C on a 12 hour light / dark cycle with access to drinking water and standard
   pellet diet ad libitum. Use of animals will be under strict animal care ethics guidelines of
   the institute.
   Dose selection: The doses for in vivo study were determined on the basis of in vitro
    results taking into account the blood volume of Swiss albino mice to be 2ml (Riches et
20 al., J. Phygiol. 228, 279-284, 1973). The concentrations that were selected are 15pM
    (0.4974 mg/kg), 25pM (0.829 mg/kg), 30pM (0.9948 mg/kg), 35pM (1.1606 mg/kg) and
   40pM     (1.3264    mg/kg).  The   total    amount     of drug    which   were   administered
    intraperitoneally during this treatment period are: 99.48pg,           165.8pg,    198.96pg,
    232.12 pg and 265.28pg.
25   In Vivo Tumor Models
    Model A: Sarcoma 180 transplantable tumor
   The murine Sarcoma-180 (5-180) cells used in this study were maintained In vlvo by
    weekly intraperitoneal passage of 1 X 106 cells in male Swiss albino mice. Solid tumors
                                                               6
    were produced by subcutaneous inoculation of 1x10 /ml            S-180 cells on the dorsal
30  surface of right hind leg of Swiss albino mice. Viability was assessed by the Trypan blue
    dye exclusion method.
    Model B: Ehrlich's ascites carcinoma
                                                  31

    WO 2014/049619                                                          PCT/IN2013/000593
    Ehrlich's ascites Carcinoma (EAC)     cells were maintained by serial intra-peritoneal
   passage of 105 cells per mice. EAC cells were collected from tumor-bearing mice at the
   exponential phase of growth, roughly 7 days after tumor transplant. The cells were
   drawn out aseptically with the help of a fine needle. The cells were washed in PBS and
 5 counted with the help of a Hemocytometer by the Trypan Blue dye exclusion test. The
   cells were suspended in PBS and inoculated into the next batch of mice.

20 Results obtained with Sarcoma-180 Tumor Model (Model A)
   (A) Anti-tumorigenic activity of M2
   The    tumoricidal  effects of   M2    was   compared     with that  of  a  conventional
   chemotherapeutic agent, cyclophosphamide. Tumor cell count, tumor weight (Figure 1 A
   & B) has been compared in different groups of experimental animals. Treatment with all
25 the 5 doses of M2 resulted in a significant decrease in tumor weight and tumor cell count
   (p<0.05)   compared to the Sarcoma Control (SC) group, thus exhibiting promising
                                                32

      WO 2014/049619                                                        PCT/INl2013/000593
   antitumor activity. Tumor weight showed a dose dependent decrease with M2 treatment.
   A dose dependent decrease in tumor cell count was also observed upto the 35 pM dose.
   The 40pM dose showed a slightly lesser inhibition in tumor cell count. The percentage
    inhibition in tumor weight. and tumor cell count is plotted In Figure 1 C & D.
 5  Interestingly, M2 treatment was significantly more effective than cyclophosphamide
   treatment (Figure 2) both in terms of tumor weight and tumor cell count.
    (B) Modulation of Cell cycle phase distribution of Tumor cells by M2
   Treatment with M2 resulted ]n a significant increase in the sub-GO region (hypolpoidy
    population) at all doses administered; Figure 3 shows representative data of the various
10  experiments. As compared to 18.4% cells in the hypoploidy region of the SC group and
   42.1% In the cyclophosphamide treated group, M2 treatment recorded 39.94%, 69.2%
   and 41.5 % hypoploid cells respectively for 30pM, 35pM and 40pM concentrations. The
    proliferative stage, as estimated by the sum of S and G2/M, also showed distinctive
   depression in M2 treated groups as compared to the untreated counterparts.
15  (C) Effect of M2 on tumor cell apoptosis.
   The induction of DNA damage in the tumor cells thereby inducing apoptosis after M2
   treatment was investigated by Comet assay. Treatment with M2 caused significant DNA
   damage in the tumor cells as is evident by the increase in the percentage of 'comet' cells
   per field of the slides studied (Figure 4) as compared to the untreated sarcoma control
20 group. Thus, the observed reduction in tumor volume, tumor weight and tumor cell
   count in the M2 treated groups can be attributed to the induction of apoptosis in tumor
   cells by M2 treatment.
   (D) Effect of M2 on liver and kidney function of treated host
   Serum     alanine aminotransferase    (ALT),  aspartate aminotransferase   (AST),  alkaline
25 phosphatase (ALP) values and creatinine levels of all the M2 treated groups were within
   the normal range except for the highest dose (Figure 5). This suggests that M2 drug,
   except the 40pM concentration, is non-toxic in all the otherdoses.
   (E) Effect of M2 on hepatic oxidative stress and anti-oxidant enzymes
   The effect of the compound on the redox status of normal tissues was Investigated by
30 detecting the LPO levels in the liver of treated and untreated tumor bearers. Figure 6
   shows the modulation of hepatic LPO by different doses of M2 as compared with normal,
   SC and tumor-bearers treated with cyclophosphamide. Livers of sarcoma control mice
                                                33

   WO 2014/049619                                                          PCT/IN2013/000593
    showed a rise in LPO levels as compared to that of normal mice. Treatment with
    cyclophosphamide further enhanced this hepatic oxidative stress. However, the levels of
    LPO showed a significant decrease (p<0.05) in all the M2 treated tumor bearers and was
    found to be comparable to normal values.
 5  Figure 7 shows changes in the activity of hepatic anti-oxidant enzymes, viz.. SOD, CAT and
    GST in all the experimental groups of mice. Treatments with M2 lead to an increase in all
    the enzyme activities as compared to the normal as wel as the sarcoma control mice.
    Particularly effective doses were found to be that of 30pM and 35 pM concentrations.
    Moreover, a comparison of the effect of M2 and cyclophosphamide on the anti-oxidant
10  enzymes suggests that the latter causes a depression in the activity of hepatic anti
    oxidant enzymes creating oxidative stress in the host.
    Thus, M2 does not induce oxidative stress in normal tissues of the host unlike the
    commonly used chemotherapeutic agent cyclophosphamide.
    (F) Effect of M2 on Bone marrow cellularity
15  The conventional chemotherapeutic drug, cyclophosphamide, is known to induce severe
     myelosuppression     in the host.  Hence,   in  order to compare       this  side-effect of
    cyclophosphamide with M2, the effect of M2 on this primary immune organ was tested.
    Quite interestingly, despite having significant anti--tumorigenic activity which is greater
    than cyclophosphamide, even the highest dose of M2 did not cause bone marrow
20  suppression in the tumor bearers. Figure 8 depicts the bone marrow cell counts in normal
    and experimental animals. In the Sarcoma control as well as the Cyclophosphamide
    treated sarcoma group, there is a significant depression in bone marrow cell count
     (p<0.05) which was ameliorated to a significant extent by administration of M2 in the
    tumor bearing mice (p < 0.05). The changes in bone marrow cell cycle phase distribution
25   in normal and experimental groups are depicted in Figure 9. The severe myelosuppressicn
    following Cyclophosphamide treatment. can be attributed to the increase in the hypoploidy
     peak viz. 48.5% as compared to only 5.5% in the normal and 20.9% in the sarcoma
     control group. Furthermore, a decrease in the proliferative phases (S and G2/M combined)
    viz. 3% in CP as compared to 21.23% in the normal and 15.15% in the sarcoma control
30   groups. Treatment with M2, however, reduced the hypoploidy peak significantly (5.4%
     only in the 40pM concentration) as compared with sarcoma control or tumor bearers
     treated with cyclophosphamide. Furthermore unlike the cyclophosphamide treated groups,
     M2 treatment did not decrease the proliferative phase as compared to sarcoma control
     groups.

   WO 2014/049619                                                            PCT/IN2013/000593
   G) Effect of M2 on the Nrf-2 protein levels in liver
   In order to further validate the anti-oxidative effect of M2 on the host hepatic system, the
   expression of Nrf-2 protein was studied by Western Blotting. Nrf-2 is an important
   transcription factor that regulates the antioxidant response by inducing the expression of
 5 anti-oxidant enzymes. M2 was found to modulate the expression of hepatic Nrf72 in a
   manner which complements observed biochemical findings (Figure 10A). In the liver, Nrf
   2 expression increased with M2 treatment when compared to the sarcoma control group.
   (H) Effect of M2 on proliferation marker PCNA in bone marrow
   In order to further establish the non-toxicity of M2 in the bone marrow compartment, the
10 expression of the proliferation marker, PCNA, was studied by Western Blotting. PCNA
   expression showed a significant increase in all the M2 treated groups as compared to the
   sarcoma control group (Figure 10B) which shows that M2 does not cause bone-marrow
   suppression which is a hallmark side-effect of the conventional chemotherapeutic drug
   cyclophosphamide.
15 (1) Effect of M2 on Tumor tissue PCNA and Kinase
   Expression of the proliferation marker, PCNA, as determined in the tumor tissues by
   Western Blotting, was found to decrease by M2 treatment which supports the anti
   proliferative effect of the compound (Figure 11A).
    Kinases have become one of the most intensively pursued classes of drug target. Thus,
20  in order to assess the effect of M2 on kinases, the expression of ERK was detected in
   tumor tissues of treated and untreated groups by Western Blotting. M2 was able to
   significantly reduce the expression of ERK as compared to the sarcoma control as well as
   the cyclophosphamide treated groups (Figure 11B).
      Results obtained with EAC Tumor Model (Model B)
25 Antitumorigenic activity of M2 in EAC
                                                    35
   Treatment with the most effective dose of M2 ( pM) resulted in a significant reduction
    in both tumor volume and tumor cell count in the EAC bearing mice as compared to EAC
    control and cyclophosphamide treated EAC tumor bearing mice (Figure 12 A, B & C).
   This confirms the potent antitumorigenic activity of M2 in yet another in vivo tumor.
30  model.
     Effect of M2 on Bone marrow cellularity
                                                 35

   WO 2014/049619                                                          PCT/AN2013/000593
   As in S-180 tumor bearing mice discussed above, M2 was found to have a protective
   effect on bone marrow in EAC tumor bearing mice unlike cyclophosphamide which
   induces myelosuppression in EAC tumor bearing mice (Figure 13). Thus, the significant
   antitumor effect of M2 was not accompanied with any undesirable toxicity to bone
 5 marrow     in   EAC   tumor   bearing    mice    unlike cyclophoshamide     which   induces
   myelosuppression.
   In this respect it is again a selective finding of the present invention that surprisingly
   compound                                                                Bis[(3-[4-({[3-({4
10 [(2cyanoethyl)(methyl)amino]benzyidene)amino)propyllimino}methyl)(methyl)anilinoJ
   propanenitrile)} (M2) was specifically identified after such extensive studies to. be found
   to bind intramolecular G-Quadruplex DNA structure and other potential quadruplex
   forming sequences over duplex DNA structures potentially effective as cancer therapeutic
   for said cancer therapeutic activity in effective amounts of 15 pLM-40 gM / 0.4974 mg/kg
15  1.3264 mg/kg for intervening with different signaling pathways and/or for down
   regulating the functions of different proteins associated in cancer biology thereby
   adapted as effective kinase suppressing and/ or any other signaling pathway interfering
   agent and/or formulations involving the same.
   The selection of a target such as the G-Quadruplex DNA structure is an essential step to
20 design a potent binder or stabilizer for the G-Quadruplex, which exists as repeats at the
   3' telomeric region of chromosome, promoter region of oncogenes and some promoter
   regions of kinase genes. It is the selective finding of the present advancement that only
   when the structure so selected has a preferred disposition in crowded organic medium
   only then can it be actually correlated with the natural structures preferred in the nuclear
25  matrix. Such an effective G-Quadruplex (2LDS.pdb) structure could be only selectively
   attained by way of extensive studies and analysis under the present advancement from
   a crowded medium, wherein the G-face of the Quadruplex is selectively exposed for
    binding with a Ilgand. Importantly since the same composition of said Quadruplex exists
    as different structural form in aqueous solution, it was a challenge to reach to such
30  structure by the techniques available to enable probing the G-face-ligand interaction with
    various molecules and reach to the drug molecules adapted as new chemical
    therapeautics of cancer, which is thus solved and selectively attained by way of the
    present advancement and considered to be very special and technically targeting the
    intended objectives of the present advancement.

    Two types of binding sites were found ovelt the selective G-Quadruplex. (2LD8.pdb)
    structure from SiteMap analysis (Figure 14). From the structural view these two binding
    sites are classified as (a) loop region, having shape of small cavities; (b) co-facial/end
    stacking region present the top of macromolecule. The loop regions are highly rich in
 5  electron density and are favorable for bindin         with small molecular fragments. These
    loop regions provide good binding affinity to hydrogen bond acceptors.
    To the other binding site i.e. the co-facial end stacking region containing the stacked
    guanine residues (G-face) (forming first quartet) is enriched with a-electron clouds from
10  all four directions. This site is thus important to develop the advanced G-Quadruplex
    stabilizing agents/formulations involving the s me as it is the most suitable region for
    small molecules, peptides or DNA, RNA apta          ers that fetches favorable entropy to the
    system resulting in its stabilization.

    quadruplex    (figure  16).Example       IV: Spectroscopic       studies of G-quadruplex
20  stabilizing agents.
    Fluorescence studies: Fluorescence emission $pectroscopy was used for analyzing the
    binding behavior of molecule M2 with G-Qua ruplex 5'-TAGGG(TTAGGG) 3-3'. A G-rich
    DNA duplex is used as a control in this study with sequence:
                                          S' -  CCGCATUACGCG - 3'
                                          3     CGGGTACTGCCC - 5'
25  The emission spectra of a DNA duplex and G-Quadruplex sequence were recorded at
    room temperature using Hitachi spectrometer (F-700 FL spectrophotometer) with one
    cm path-length quartz cuvette. The emission spectrum was recorded from 300-500 nm
    with an excitation wavelength of 260 nm. Excitation and emission slits were set to 5 nm
    each. Emission spectra were recorded by litrating small molecules up to 50 pM
30  concentration against 10 pM G-Quadruplex and' duplex DNA.
    A significant hypsochromic shift or blue shift in fluorescence emission provides strong
    evidence whether a drug/ligand molecule binds to G-Quadruplex or not. The fluorescence

   experiment was carried out by titrating the molecule M2 (0-50 pM) with G-Quadruplex,
   5'-TAGGG(TTAGGG)    3 (10pM). The characteristic emission of the spectrum was shown in
   Figure 5. A total of 18 nm hypsochromic shifts in G-Quadruplex emission spectra was
   observed when M2 binds to it (Figure 17A). The change in fluorescence emission
 5 maxima of G-Quadruplex as a function of concentration of ligand molecule M2, yields an
   equilibrium dissociation constant (Ko) of 31i1.2 pM (Figure 17B). A control experiment
   was performed for a GC rich DNA duplex,
                                      5' - GCGCATGCTACGCG- 3'
                                      3' - CGCGTACGATGCGC - 5'
   in presence of M2. Interestingly it has been observed that no blue shift on the emission
10 spectra of DNA duplex happened upon the addition of ligands (Figures          17C). This
   experimental evidence showed that M2 is highly selective binder to G-Quadruplex
   structures over the DNA duplex.
   The examples discussed hereinbefore are the best embodiments for the present
   invention and do not limit the scope of the invention.
