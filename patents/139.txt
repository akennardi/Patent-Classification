          [0002]         The present invention relates generally to stimulation systems and
methods of use thereof. The stimulation systems may be used to stimulate one or more

                                         BACKGROUND
          [0003]         Dry eye syndrome is a debilitating disease that affects millions of
patients worldwide and can cripple some patients. Millions of these individuals suffer from
the most severe form. This disease often inflicts severe ocular discomfort, results in a
dramatic shift in quality of life, induces poor ocular surface health, substantially reduces
visual acuity and can threaten vision. Patients with severe dry eye develop a sensitivity to
light and wind that prevents substantial time spent outdoors, and they often cannot read or
drive because of the discomfort. Current treatment options provide little relief for those
suffering from severe conditions. Current options include artificial tears, punctal plugs,
humidity goggles, topical cyclosporine, and tarsorrhaphy. None of these treatments provides
sufficient relief or treatment of the disease. What is needed is a system for restoring adequate
tear production in patients having dry eye syndrome.

    WO 2012/139063                                                          PCT/US2012/032629
                                       BRIEF SUMMARY
           [0004]       Described here are devices and methods for stimulating tissues. The
stimulation systems may comprise a microstimulator and one or more controllers. In some
variations, the microstimulator may comprise a passive stimulation circuit. In some
variations, the microstimulator may comprise a housing and an extension connected to the
housing and carrying at least one electrode. In some of these variations, the extension may be
flexible. In some variations, the microstimulator may have a length of about 0.6 cm to about
2 cm, and a thickness of about 1 mm to about 2 mm, and a width of about 3 mm to about 8
mm. The microstimulator may be conformable and flexible and may have one or more
fixation elements. The one or more fixation elements may include one or more hooks, barbs,
and anchors. The microstimulator may have one or more coatings which may be adhesive
and/or bioabsorbable. In some variations the microstimulator may comprise one or more
coatings that are electrically conductive and/or electrically insulative
           [0005]       The passive stimulation circuit may include a tank circuit and have one
or more electrical safety features. The electrical safety features may include one or more
current limiting rectifiers and one or more zener diodes. The electrical safety features may
include a voltage limiting circuit to limit the voltage emitted by the stimulation component.
The electrical safety feature may also include a current limiting element or circuit to limit the
current emitted by the stimulation component and a charge output limiting element or circuit
to limit the charge emitted by the stimulation component.
           [0006]       In some variations the passive stimulation circuit may comprise a
ramping control unit. In some of these variations, the ramping control unit may comprise a
charging unit and a field-effect transistor. The ramping control unit may control the
amplitude of the stimulation signal generated by the stimulation circuit, and the stimulation
circuit may be configured to produce a ramped stimulation signal. The passive stimulation
circuit may comprise a signal conditioning unit. In some variations, the signal conditioning
unit may comprise a rectifying unit. In some variations, the signal conditioning unit may
comprise an amplitude limiting unit. In some variations, the signal condition unit may
comprise a current source unit. The passive stimulation circuit may comprise a receiving unit
and an output unit.

    WO 2012/139063                                                            PCT/US2012/032629
           [0007]        The passive stimulation circuit within a microstimulator may also
include a variable resistive element, a variable capacitive element and one or more electrodes.
The one or more electrodes of the passive stimulation circuit may be contact points, may be
nestled within the microstimulator, may be coupled to a flexible lead, and may be coupled to
a rigid lead. The one or more electrodes may contain platinum, iridium, platinum iridium,
iridium oxide, titanium nitride, tantalum, or combinations thereof.
           [0008]        The microstimulator may be coupled to a controller and be
hermetically sealed. The microstimulator may be injectable into a patient using a delivery
system. The delivery system may comprise an insertion device (such as a 12 or larger gauge
needle) and/or a dissection tool. The microstimulator may have one or more features to
facilitate minimally invasive retrieval. The length and width of the microstimulator may be
selected to permit placement of a portion of the microstimulator adjacent to the lacrimal
gland. The length and width of the microstimulator may also be selected to permit placement
of the entire microstimulator adjacent to the lacrimal gland and to permit placement of the
microstimulator on, partially in, within or about the lacrimal gland.
           [0009]        In some variations, a method for treating dry eye by stimulating one or
more nerves that innervate lacrimal gland tissue includes implanting a microstimulator
adjacent to the lacrimal gland and applying stimulation to the lacrimal gland. The
microstimulator may comprise a passive stimulation circuit comprising a ramping control
unit. The microstimulator may be adjacent to the lacrimal gland and fully implanted within
an orbit of a patient's eye. The microstimulator may be positioned such that it directly
contacts the lacrimal gland. The microstimulator may be positioned such that it partially
penetrates into the lacrimal gland. The microstimulator may be fully implanted into or
completely within the lacrimal gland. The microstimulator may be fully or partially
implanted within the orbit of the eye.
           [0010]        The stimulation provided by the microstimulator may selectively
stimulate one or more nerves that innervate the lacrimal gland. The stimulation may
selectively stimulate the one or more nerves that innervate the lacrimal gland without causing
movement of the eye, without stimulating the ocular muscles, and without stimulating the
superior rectus, lateral rectus, levator palpebrae superioris, retina or corresponding motor
nerves. In some variations, the stimulation may selectively stimulate autonomic efferent
                                                 3

    WO 2012/139063                                                          PCT/US2012/032629
fibers of the lacrimal gland. The autonomic efferent fibers may be selectively stimulated
over the sensory afferent fibers or the A-delta pain fibers or over the C pain fibers. In some
variations, the stimulation may selectively stimulate afferent fibers of the lacrimal gland, and
may induce unilateral or bilatering tearing. In certain variations, the stimulation may
stimulate only the one or more nerves that innervate the lacrimal gland. In some variations,
the stimulation may selectively stimulate the acinar and/or ductal cells of the lacrimal gland.
The stimulation may stimulate a combination of acinar cells, ductals cells, efferent fibers,
and/or afferent fibers of the lacrimal gland.
           [0011]        When implanted, the microstimulator may conform to the fossa for the
lacrimal gland after implantation. The microstimulator may conform to an exterior aspect of a
lacrimal gland after implantation. Implanting a microstimulator may further include
conforming the microstimulator to an exterior aspect of the lacrimal gland. After
implantation, the microstimulator may conform to an exterior aspect of the fossa for the
lacrimal gland.
           [0012]        The microstimulator may be implanted using an insertion device. In
some variations, the insertion device is a 12 or larger gauge needle. In other variations, the
insertion device comprises a cannula. In some variations, the insertion device may comprise
a piston assembly, which in some variations may be spring-powered. The microstimulator
may be loaded into the insertion device, and the insertion device may be inserted into an
insertion pathway. In some variations, using an anatomical landmark at the corner of the eye,
a needle may be positioned in proximity to the lacrimal gland, and the microstimulator may
be deployed using the needle. Anatomical landmarks include, but are not limited to, the
lateral canthis, an eyelid margin, a palpebral lobe of the lacrimal gland, the orbital rim, a
bony protuberance on the superior-lateral aspect of the orbit, the vascular bed, or the like. In
some variations, a microstimulator may be implanted by lifting the eyelid, forming an
insertion pathway through the conjunctiva under the eyelid, and advancing the
microstimulator into the insertion pathway. The insertion pathway may be formed using a
dissection tool. In some variations, the insertion pathway may be formed using a dissection
element of an insertion tool. In some variations, the insertion pathway may be formed
between the periosteum and the orbital bone. In other variations, the insertion pathway may
be formed between the periosteum and the lacrimal gland.

   WO 2012/139063                                                          PCT/US2012/032629
          [0013]       The stimulation may include a current having a pulse amplitude
between about 250 iA to about 25mA. The stimulation may include a pulse amplitude, a
pulse width, and a pulse frequency, and one or more of the pulse amplitude, pulse width, or
pulse frequency which may be varied over the treatment period. The stimulation may have a
pulse frequency between about 2Hz to about 270Hz, between about 15Hz to about 40Hz, or
between 30 Hz to about 60 Hz. The stimulation may include a current having a pulse width
between about 50 isec to about 2700 isec. Stimulation having the above-mentioned
parameters may be used to treat one or more conditions, such as dry eye. Stimulation pulses
may be delivered continuously or intermittently, and may be delivered according to one or
more patterns.
          [0014]       Implanting a microstimulator may further include identifying an
insertion point for implantation based upon a feature of the orbit. The stimulation may be
delivered in bursts and adjusted in response to a measured variable. The stimulation may
include a current having a pulse width between about 50 isec to about 2000 isec. A controller
may be positioned in proximity to the microstimulator and may generate a magnetic field.
The magnetic field may be adjusted based on input from the user and/or based on the degree
of coupling to the microstimulator. The magnetic field may be generated in bursts and
coupled to the microstimulator to generate the stimulation. The magnetic field may have a
frequency of about 10kHz to about 100MHz. The magnetic field may have a frequency of
about 100kHz to about 5MHz. In some variations, the magnetic field may have a frequency
between about 1MHz and about 5MHz.
          [0015]       In some variations, a system for treating dry eye may include a
microstimulator configured for implantation into an orbit of an eye and a controller for
generating a magnetic field to couple to the microstimulator. The controller may be housed
within a hand-held device. The controller may comprise a patch which may be attached to a
patient using one or more adhesive layers. The controller may be flexible and conformable, or
may be partially flexible or comforable. The controller may be coupled to, or at least partially
contained within, a flexible or conformable material. The microstimulator may have a length
of about 0.6 cm to about 2 cm and a width of about 1 mm to about 8.5 mm and may include a
passive stimulation circuit configured to receive the magnetic field generated by the
controller. The controller may be flexible, conformable, and capable of detecting one or more
operating parameters of the microstimulator. At least part of the controller may be disposable

   WO 2012/139063                                                            PCT/US2012/032629
and rechargeable. The controller may be coupled to, or at least partially contained within, an
eyeglass frame, a wrist watch, or other object. In some variations, the controller may be
configured to attach to an eyeglass frame using one or more adhesive layers and/or
mechanical coupling elements.
           [0016]       In some variations, a method for treating dry eye by stimulating one or
more nerves that innervate lacrimal gland tissue may include positioning one or more
stimulation electrodes adjacent to the lacrimal gland and applying stimulation to the lacrimal
gland. A microstimulator may be adjacent the lacrimal gland fully implanted within an orbit
of a patient's eye. The microstimulator may be adjacent to and directly contacting the
lacrimal gland, adjacent to and at least partially penetrating into the lacrimal gland, and
adjacent to and fully implanted into or completely within the lacrimal gland. Adjacent to the
lacrimal gland may be about, within or partially in the lacrimal gland. The microstimulator
may be fully implanted within the orbit of the eye. The one or more electrodes are
electrically coupled to a pulse generator, which may be implantable. The pulse generator may
be implantable in proximity to the one or more stimulation electrodes. The pulse generator
may be implantable in proximity to the temporal bone, a subclavicular pocket, or a
subcutaneous abdominal pocket. The method may further include positioning a controller in
proximity to the pulse generator.
           [0017]       In some variations, a microstimulator may include a coil, a housing,
and a pair of electrodes. The coil may be formed from a wire having a length turned into a
plurality of windings and responsive to an induced field to produce an output signal. The
microstimulator may be electrically coupled to receive the output from the coil and produce a
signal responsive to the output. The housing may encompass the circuit and the coil, and
may be adapted and configured for placement within an orbit and adjacent an eye within the
orbit. The pair of electrodes may extend from the housing and be configured to receive the
signal. In some variations, the electrodes may be integrated into the housing. The electrodes
may have the same shape or may have different shapes. In some variations, one electrode
may have a larger surface area, which may reduce the current density at that electrode. The
electrodes may be spaced apart (e.g., by about 6 mm to about 15 mm), which may increase
current flow through surrounding tissue. When positioned near the lacrimal gland, one or
more of the electrodes may be placed in direct or indirect contact with the lacrimal gland.

    WO 2012/139063                                                          PCT/US2012/032629
           [0018]        The pair of electrodes and the housing may be shaped for injection
through the lumen of an insertion device. The housing may be configured for placement
adjacent to a lacrimal gland, within an orbit to permit selective stimulation of a lacrimal gland
with the signal, and within a fossa near the lacrimal gland to position the pair of electrodes
on, in or about a lacrimal gland.
           [0019]        The housing may be configured for placement in proximity to a
lacrimal gland without being in proximity to a muscle of the eye. The housing may have a
curvature conforming at least partially to the curvature of a fossa for the lacrimal gland, or a
curvature conforming at least partially to an exterior aspect of a lacrimal gland.
           [0020]        The microstimulator may further include a second coil, a second
rectifying and tuning circuit. The second coil may be within the housing and oriented nearly
orthogonal to the second coil. The second rectifying and capacitive circuit may be within the
housing and coupled to the second coil, such that the second rectifying and capacitive circuit
is configured to produce a second signal. The selector switch may be within the housing and
connected to receive the first signal and the second signal and supply one of the first signal
and the second signal to the pair of electrodes. The selector switch may determine which one
of the first signal and the second signal to send to the electrodes based on a comparison of the
first signal and the second signal.
           [0021]        Current from the two signals may be summed without the use of a
selector switch. The signal from the coil may have a frequency corresponding to the induced
field, which may be generated from an external coil through mutual inductance. The induced
field may be generated by an external controller.
           [0022]        The signal generated in the coil may have a frequency about equal to
the frequency of the induced field generated by the external controller. The induced field
generated by the external controller may have a frequency based on user input. The external
controller may be contained within a hand-held device and may be disposable. The external
controller may be contained within one of an adhesive patch, a pair of eye glasses, and a head
set. The circuit may include a diode to rectify a current signal and a capacitor for storing
charge and/or filtering the rectified signal. The circuit may include a rectifying circuit that
may include a diode and a resistor connected in parallel. The signal may have a voltage with
an amplitude of between 0. 1V and 25V, a current with an amplitude between 10lA and
                                                 7

25mA, and a pulsed current with a frequency of 2Hz to 1000Hz. The pair of electrodes may
be connected to leads, which may include tines.
          [0023]        In some variations, a method of implanting a microstimulator adjacent
to the eye may include inserting an access device percutaneously into an orbit of an eye. A
microstimulator may be advanced through the access device into a position in proximity to
the superior lateral aspect of the orbit. A stimulation signal may be applied to a portion of the
eye with the microstimulator. Before the inserting step, an insertion point may be inserted for
the access device based on the insertion point's relation to a feature on the orbit. After the
advancing, the microstimulator may be positioned within a fossa of the lacrimal gland, and at
least one electrode of the microstimulator may be positioned on, in or adjacent to a lacrimal
gland, and an electrode of the microstimulator is positioned on, in or adjacent a lacrimal
gland.
          [0024]        Tear production may be increased in the eye. Vasodilation of the
lacrimal gland may occur unilaterally or bilaterally. After advancing, an electrode of the
microstimulator may be positioned on, in or adjacent to a neural structure associated with a
lacrimal gland. During the applying, the signal only stimulates a lacrimal gland, the signal
may selectively stimulate a lacrimal gland over a muscle of the eye, or the signal is selected
to stimulate a lacrimal gland without stimulating a muscle fiber of the eye. After the
advancing, an electrode of the microstimulator is positioned adjacent to a neural structure
associated with a lacrimal gland and spaced apart from a muscle of the eye. The muscle of the
eye may be a rectus muscle or an oblique muscle or a levator palpebrae muscle. The
microstimulator may be adjacent a lacrimal gland and spaced apart from a superior rectus
muscle or a lateral rectus muscle or a levator palpebrae muscle. The signal may stimulate a
lacrimal gland without activating a rectus muscle or an oblique muscle or a levator muscle in
proximity to the lacrimal gland.
          [0025]        In some variations, a method for using a microstimulator may include
receiving a microstimulator at the orbit of a patient's eye. A magnetic field may be received
by the microstimulator from an external power source such as a controller. A current may be
generated by the microstimulator from the magnetic field. The current may be applied to the
patient to produce tears in the patient's eye or vasodilation of the lacrimal gland.

          [0026]        In some variations, a method for using a microstimulator may include
implanting a stimulation device within a patient's orbit. A controller with a power source
may be placed external to the patient's skin and in communication with the microstimulator.
A magnetic field may be applied to the microstimulator from the controller. A current may be
generated in the microstimulator from the magnetic field. The current may be applied to
produce tears in the patient's eye, cause vasodilation in the lacrimal gland, release lacrimal
proteins into a patient's tear film, and/or cause lacrimation of the contralateral lacrimal gland.
          [0027]        In some variations, a system for treating a patient with dry eye
syndrome may include a microstimulator and a controller. The microstimulator may be
responsive to a magnetic field and placed within an orbit of a patient's eye. The
microstimulator may be configured to generate a current based on the magnetic field and
apply the current to a patient to produce tears in the patient's eye. The controller may be
configured to generate the magnetic field and be placed at a location near the
microstimulator.
          [0028]        In some variations, a method for treating a patient with dry eye
syndrome may begin with insert a microstimulator within an orbit of a patient's eye using a
positioning device. A controller, which may include a power source, may be placed external
to a patient's skin and in proximity to the micro stimulator. A magnetic field may be applied
to the microstimulator by the controller. A current may be generated by the microstimulator
from the magnetic field. The current may then be applied to a patient to produce tears in the
patient's eye. In some variations, a method for using a microstimulator may begin with
connecting a microstimulator to a multi-electrode lead positioned on, in or adjacent a lacrimal
gland. One or more electrodes may be selected from the multi-electrode lead to activate tear
production in a patient's eye.

                                   DETAILED DESCRIPTION
           [0061]        Described here are stimulation systems for stimulating anatomical
targets in a patient for the treatment of one or more conditions. The stimulation systems may
include at least one controller and at least one microstimulator. The controller may be
implemented as a part of the microstimulator, or as a separate device. When formed as a
separate device, the controller may communicate with the microstimulator via a wireless
and/or wired connection. The controller may produce a waveform signal which may convey
power and/or information to the microstimulator and the microstimulator may deliver one or
more stimulation signals to an anatomical target based on the waveform signal.
           [0062]        The stimulation systems may be used to stimulate any suitable
anatomical target or targets to treat a number of conditions. In some variations, the
stimulation systems described here may be used to treat dry eye. For example, the
stimulation systems may be used to stimulate one or more nerves, tissues, glands, or other
structures involved in the process of lacrimation or glandular vasodilation. For example, the
systems may stimulate one or more of a lacrimal gland, one or more meibomian glands,
lacrimal ducts, parasympathetic nerves, fibers and neurites, sympathetic nerves, fibers and
neurites, rami lacrimales, lacrimal nerve, perivascular nerves of lacrimal artery and branches
thereof, nerve fibers innervating the meibomian glands, myoepithelial cells of the lacrimal
gland, acinar cells of the lacrimal gland, ductal cells of the lacrimal gland. Methods of
treating dry eye and other conditions are described in more detail below. Also described here

are delivery systems and methods for delivering or otherwise implanting one or more
microstimulators and/or controllers into a patient.
           STIMULATION SYSTEMS
           [0063]       FIGS. 1A and lB show block diagrams of two variations of the
stimulation systems described here. FIG. 1A depicts a wireless stimulation system (100)
including a controller (110) and a microstimulator (120). As shown there, the controller
(110) may include a housing (119) and may contain a controller circuit (115). The controller
circuit (115) may generate and transmit an output signal (112), which may be received
wirelessly by the microstimulator (120). The transmitted signal may include one or more
magnetic fields, electronic signals, radiofrequency signals, optical signals, ultrasound signals,
or the like. The output signal (112) may provide power and/or information to the
microstimulator (120) as will be described in more detail below. The controller may be
implanted within the patient, or may remain external patient, as will be described in more
detail below. The controller circuit (115) may be any suitable circuit, such as one or more of
the controller circuits described in more detail below.
           [0064]       As shown in FIG. 1A, the microstimulator (120) may include one or
more electrodes (117), one or more leads (113), and a stimulation circuit (121). While the
electrodes (117) are shown in FIG. 1A as being connected to the stimulation circuit (121) via
leads (113), it should be appreciated that the microstimulator (120) need not include leads.
The microstimulator (120) may be implanted within a patient and positioned with respect to
the controller (110) whereby the microstimulator (120) may receive the output signal (112)
generated by the controller (110). The stimulation circuit (121) may receive the output signal
(112), and may generate a stimulation signal (114) based on the received output signal (112).
For example, in some variations the microstimulator (120) may comprise a passive
stimulation circuit that is configured to process the output signal (112) and deliver the
processed signal as a stimulation signal (114) to tissue without using any internal logic or
intelligence within the microstimulator (120). In some variations, the microstimulator (120)
may use internal logic or intelligence in processing the received output signal (112). The
resulting stimulation signal (114) may be a direct current or alternating current signal, and
may be applied to an anatomical target (123), such as for example a lacrimal gland, via one or
more of the electrodes (117). The stimulation signal (114) may be charge-balanced. The
                                                13

    WO 2012/139063                                                           PCT/US2012/032629
microstimulator may be configured in any suitable manner, as will be described in more
detail below.
          [0065]        When the stimulation signal (114) is delivered to an anatomical target
(123), the stimulation may result in a desired physiological effect (such as, for example,
generating tears in a patient). Stimulation of an anatomical target (123) may produce any
suitable endocrinological or other physiological outcome, including, but not limited to,
secretion of fluid, electrolytes, and proteins, vasodilatation, increasing the volume of tears,
increasing the quality of tears, improving surface health, decreasing tear osmolarity, and
decreasing ocular inflammation.
          [0066]        FIG. lB shows a block diagram of a variation of a wired stimulation
system (130). The wired stimulation system (130) may include a controller (140) and a
microstimulator (150). The controller (140) may include a housing (149) and a controller
circuit (145), and may be configured to transmit an output signal (142) to the microstimulator
(150) via a wired transmission line (148), such as a conducting wire or other medium. The
wired transmission line (148) may be attached to the controller (140) and be routed through a
patient's body to the microstimulator (150).     The microstimulator (150) may be implanted
within a patient and positioned with respect to the controller (140) such that the
microstimulator (150) may receive the output signal (142) from the controller (140). The
stimulation circuit (151) may receive the output signal (142), and may generate a stimulation
signal (144) based on the received output signal (142). The stimulation signal (144) may be
applied to an anatomical target (153), such as for example a lacrimal gland, via one or more
of the electrodes (147) and, in some instances, one or more leads (143). Stimulation of the
anatomical target (153) may result in one or more physiological or other endocrinological
outcomes (159), such as those described immediately above.
          [0067]        When the stimulation systems comprises a transmission line between a
controller and microstimulator, or a lead connecting one or more electrodes to a
microstimulator, the transmission line and/or leads may be tunneled. The tunneling pathway
may depend on where the microstimulator, controller, and/or electrodes are implanted. For
example, a tunneling pathway may extend from the ear region (superficial to the temporal
bone) to the temporal aspect of the orbit into the superior lateral aspect of the orbit, through
the orbital septum and to the anatomical target.

          Microstimulators
          [0068]        As mentioned above, the stimulation systems described here comprise
one or more microstimulators. The microstimulator may be any device suitable for delivering
stimulation to tissue. In some variations, the microstimulator may comprise one or more
passive stimulation circuits in which the device does not include any internal logic or
intelligence (e.g., ASICs, microcontrollers or the like). In some of these variations, the
microstimulator does not have an internal battery. In these variations, the microstimulator
may include only a dissipation circuit that receives an output signal from a controller,
generates a current based on the received signal, and delivers the generated current. The
dissipation circuit may contain one or more signal conditioning units which may shape or
otherwise modify the signal received from a controller. In some variations, the circuit may
be configured to receive energy from an external source, rectify the energy into a stimulation
pulse, and allow for passive charge balancing. In some variations the stimulation circuit may
comprise one or more current rectifiers, one or more amplitude limiting units, and one or
more ramping control units, combinations, thereof, or the like. In some variations, the
dissipation circuit may comprise one or more adjustable/tunable components.
          [0069]        In other variations, a microstimulator may include internal logic which
may be used to shape or modify a signal received from a controller. In some of these
variations, the microstimulator may not include an internal battery, such that operating power
is received by the output signal of a controller. In still other variations, the microstimulator
may comprise an implantable pulse generator, which may include all of the circuitry
necessary to generate and deliver electrical pulses to tissue. The stimulation circuits
described here may contain elements which allow a controller to detect one or more operating
parameters of the stimulation circuit.
          [0070]        FIG. 2 depicts one variation of a passive stimulation circuit (200)
which may be used with the stimulation devices described here. As shown there, the
stimulation circuit (200) may include a microstimulator coil (202) (e.g., a conductive coil), a
rectifying circuit (205) including a diode (204) and a resistor (206), a tuning capacitor (208),
and a coupling capacitor (216). As shown there, one end of the microstimulator coil (202)
may be connected to a first end of tuning capacitor (208), and a first end of the rectifying
circuit (205). The resistor (206) and diode (204) may be connected in parallel, with a first

end of the rectifying circuit (205) connected to the tuning capacitor (208) and the
microstimulator coil (202) and the second end of the rectifying circuit (205) connected to the
coupling capacitor (216). The coupling capacitor (216) may be connected to a first electrode
(210). It should be appreciated that the rectifying circuit (205) may comprise a half-wave
rectifier, a full-wave rectifier, or the like. The second end of microstimulator coil (202) may
be connected to the other end of the tuning capacitor (208) and a second electrode (212).
           [0071]         In operation, a magnetic field generated by a controller (not shown)
may be applied to microstimulator coil (202). The microstimulator coil (202) may generate a
current icoi1 as a result of the applied magnetic field (e.g., via inductive coupling). The tuning
capacitor (208) may form a tuning circuit with the microstimulator coil (202) such that the
microstimulator coil (202) only receives magnetic fields generated using a specific frequency
or range of frequencies. The current may pass through the rectifying circuit of resistor (208)
and diode (204) and deliver a current      iload between first (210) and second (212) electrodes.
The current    iload may pass through tissue (214) (represented in FIG. 2 as a resistor). The
coupling capacitor (216) may provide AC-coupling and charge-balancing for the stimulation
applied to the tissue (214). The coupling capacitor (216) may charge when an active
stimulation pulse is passed through the rectifying circuit (205), and may discharge through
the resistor (208) of the rectifying circuit during an inactive phase following the delivery of
the active stimulation pulse.
           [0072]         Because the passive stimulation circuit is configured to condition and
deliver the output signal received from a controller, one or more characteristics of the
stimulation signal delivered by a microstimulator may be at least partially dependent on one
or more characteristics of the stimulation signal. The controller may adjust one or more
characteristics of the output signal (e.g., the amplitude, burst width, burst frequency, etc.) to
alter the one or more characteristics (e.g., amplitude, pulse width, pulse frequency, etc.) of
the stimulation signal produced by the microstimulator. For example, the amplitude of a
signal applied generated by a microstimulator may be adjusted by modifying the amplitude of
an alternating magnetic field produced by a controller coil.
           [0073]         While the stimulation circuit (200) is shown in FIG. 2 as comprising a
coil (202), it should be appreciated that the stimulation circuits described here may receive
energy in any suitable manner. For example, in some variations the stimulation may be

    WO 2012/139063                                                            PCT/US2012/032629
configured to receive magnetic energy. In these variations, the microstimulator may
comprise one or more coils (such as shown in FIG. 2) and/or magneto-electrical elements
which may be formed from a material that generates a current when a magnetic field is
applied thereto. The magneto-electrical elements may be formed from one or more materials
such as Cr 2O 3, one or more mutiferroic materials, combinations thereof and the like.
Magneto-electrical elements may allow for current generation with a smaller volume or
device footprint than may be required for a coil. The magneto-electrical elements may
further be shaped such that it may be capable of generating a current when positioned in
multiple orientations relative to a magnetic field.
            [0074]      In some variations, the stimulation circuit may be configured to receive
ultrasound energy. For example, in some variations the microstimulator may comprise one or
more ultrasound transducers which may generate current in response to a transmitted
ultrasound signal. In some variations, the ultrasound signal may be focused on the
microstimulator using one or more ultrasound transmitters. In other variations, the
microstimulator may be configured to receive optical energy (e.g., infrared, ultraviolet,
visible wavelengths, or the like) and generate a current in response thereto. For example, in
some variations a stimulation circuit may comprise one or more photo-voltaic elements that
generate a current in response to received optical energy. In other variations, the
microstimulator may be configured to receive far-field RF energy. For example, high
frequency RF energy may be received by the microstimulator using an antenna, and may
allow for tolerate for a variety of microstimulator orientations. It should be appreciated that
in some variations, the microstimulators described here may be capable of receiving energy
from a plurality of sources, such as a combination of magnetic, ultrasound, optical, and/or RF
signals.
            [0075]      In variations where a stimulation circuit is configured to generate a
current using inductive coupling, the stimulation circuit may be configured to improve
tolerance to angular misalignment between internal and external components. In some of
these variations, a microstimulator may include two or more coils positioned in non-parallel
orientations. FIGS. 3A-3F illustrate three variations of coil arrangements having multiple
coils. For example, FIGS. 3A and 3B show a side view and a top view, respectively, of a coil
arrangement (300) comprising a first coil (302) and a second coil (304). As shown there, the
first coil (302) may be positioned in a plane that is at an angle (01) relative to a plane of the

second coil (304). The angle (01) between the planes of the first and second coils is shown in
FIGS. 3A and 3B as being approximately 90 degrees, but it should be appreciated that this
angle may be any suitable angle (e.g., about 45 degrees, about 60 degrees, etc.). By
positioning the coils in different planes, the coil arrangement may still be able to generate a
current even if one of the coils is positioned perpendicularly to an external coil.
           [0076]       FIGS. 3C and 3D illustrate a side view and a top view, respectively, of
another variation of a coil arrangement (306) having a first coil (308), a second coil (310),
and a third coil (312). The planes of each of the first (308), second (310), and third (312)
coils may be angled relative to other coils. For example, in the variation shown in FIGS. 3C
and 3D, the plane of the first coil (308) may be perpendicular to the plane of the second coil
(310), and the plane of the third coil (312) may be perpendicular to the planes of both the first
(308) and second coils (310). It should be appreciated that the angle between any of the two
coils may be any suitable angle. FIGS. 3E and 3F depict a perspective view and a side view,
respectively, of another variation of a coil arrangement (314) having a first coil (316), a
second coil (318), and a third coil (320). The planes of each of the first (316), second (318),
and third (320) coils may be angled relative to the other coils, as described immediately
above. Additionally, to help reduce the overall profile of the coil arrangement (314), the first
coil (316) may be positioned within the second coil (318), and the first (316) and second
(318) coils may be positioned within the third coil (320). In instances where a stimulation
circuit comprises a coil arrangement comprising a plurality of coils, the stimulation circuit
may comprise a plurality of tuning circuits, and the currents produced by the plurality of coils
may be summed using rectifiers.
           [0077]       While the passive stimulation circuit (200) described above with
respect to FIG. 2 as being configured to deliver electrical stimulation to a patient, it should be
appreciated that the microstimulators described here may be configured to apply any suitable
stimulation to a patient. In some variations, a microstimulator may be configured to deliver
one or more optical signals, acoustic signals, or the like to a patient.
           [0078]       The stimulation circuits described here may comprise one or more
electrical safety features. The electrical safety features may limit one or more parameters of

include one or more elements such as a capacitor in series with the electrodes to limit charge
delivery, one or more elements such as a capacitor in series with the electrodes to ensure DC
charge-balanced stimulation, one or more resistors in parallel with the electrodes and/or
series capacitor to allow for DC charge-balanced stimulation by capacitive discharge, one or
more current-limiting diodes in series with the electrodes to limit maximum stimulation
current amplitude, one or more zener diodes to limit maximum output voltage, combinations
thereof or the like. The resistor in parallel with the electrodes may be of a larger impedance
than the tissue load impedance to ensure power efficient stimulation.
           [0079]       FIG. 4 shows one variation of a stimulation circuit (400) comprising a
current-limiting device. As shown there, stimulation circuit (400) may comprise a coil (402),
a tuning capacitor (404), and a rectifying circuit (405) consisting of a diode (406) and a
resistor (408), and first (414) and second (416) electrodes. These elements may be the same
as the components of stimulation circuit (200) and may be positioned as described above in
relation to FIG. 2. Additionally shown in FIG. 4 is a current-limiting diode (412), where the
current-limiting diode (412) separates the second electrode (416) from the coil (402) and
tuning capacitor (404). Current limiting diode (412) may limit the current that passes through
the diode (412), which may also limit the current that is passed through a tissue load (410)
between first (414) and second (416) electrodes. For example, when a pulse is delivered
through the tissue load (410), as will be described in more detail below, a recharge current
that provides charge balancing may initially have an amplitude that causes discomfort or
stimulation of unintended tissues. A current-limiting device (or one or of the electrical safety
features described above, such as a high-impedance recharge circuit or a zener diode or
voltage limiting element in parallel with the tissue load) may limit the magnitude of the
recharge current, and may thereby prevent unintended tissue stimulation or discomfort/pain.
           [0080]       In some variations, the stimulation circuits described here comprises
one or more adjustable elements. For example, the stimulation circuit may comprise one or
more variable resistance elements, variable capacitive elements, variable inductance
elements, variable non-linear elements, or the like. The variable resistive elements, capacitive
elements, inductive elements, or nonlinear elements may be used to alter a characteristic of
the stimulation circuit, such as the resonant frequency, or stimulation parameter such as for
example amplitude. In variations that include a variable component, the variable components
may be reversibly varied, or irreversibly varied. In some instances, one or more of the

variable components may be controlled and varied by an external controller, as described in
more detail below. The variable components may be adjusted to adjust or otherwise alter one
or more functions of the microstimulator. For example, an adjustable element may be used to
alter the resonant frequency of a receiving unit or output unit of the microstimulator, which
may control the frequency of output signals that the receiving unit is capable of receiving and
the frequency of stimulation signals generated by the microstimulator. Additionally or
alternatively, an adjustable element may be used to alter one or more parameters of
stimulation provided by a microstimulator (e.g., amplitude, pulse width, etc.).
           [0081]        Any of the components of the stimulation circuits described here may
be adjustable. For example, in some variations the tuning capacitor (208) from the
stimulation circuit (200) may be tuned to adjust the output of the stimulation circuit (200).
FIGS. 5A and 5B show two examples of stimulation circuits comprising adjustable elements.
FIG. 5A shows a variation of stimulation circuit (500). As shown there, stimulation circuit
(500) may comprise a coil (502), a tuning capacitor (504), and a rectifying circuit (505)
consisting of a diode (506) and a resistor (508), first (514) and second (516) electrodes, and a
current limiting diode (512). These elements may be arranged as described above in relation
to FIGS. 2 and 4. Additionally shown there is a variable element (518) positioned in series
between the rectification circuit and the first electrode (514). The variable element (518)
may comprise a variable impedance element such as an opto-FET, an optically tunable
resistor, a capacitor, a programmable current limiter, or the like. The variable element (518)
may be adjusted (e.g., via a controller) to alter the current that flows therethrough, which may
alter the current that is delivered through a tissue load (510) between the first (514) and
second (516) electrodes. FIG. 5B shows another variation of a stimulation circuit (520),
which includes the same components as FIG. 5A, but wherein the variable element (518) is
positioned in parallel with the first (514) and second (516) electrodes.
           [0082]        In some variations, a microstimulator may comprise a passive
stimulation circuit configured to passively ramp up the amplitude of stimulation signal that is
supplied to the patient during stimulation. In some of these variations, the passive
stimulation circuit may further be configured to limit the maximum amplitude of the
stimulation signal provided to the patient. FIG. 36 shows a block diagram of one variation of
a passive stimulation circuit (3600) which may be configured to passively ramp up the
stimulation signal produced by the stimulation circuit. As shown there, the passive

    WO 2012/139063                                                          PCT/US2012/032629
stimulation circuit (3600) may comprise a receiving unit (3602), a signal conditioning unit
(3603), a ramping control unit (3608), and an output unit (3610). The signal receiving unit
(3602) may receive one or more output signals from a controller, which may be used to
power the signal conditioning unit (3603) and the ramping control unit (3608). In some
variations, the signal receiving unit (3602) may be a tuned circuit, such that the signal
receiving unit (3602) only receives output signals of a certain frequency or range of
frequencies.
          [0083]        The signal conditioning unit (3603) may include an amplitude limiting
unit (3604) and a rectification unit (3606), although it should be appreciated that the signal
conditioning unit (3606) may comprise any combination of units which may shape or
otherwise alter the output signal received by the receiving unit (3602). In variations where
the signal conditioning unit (3603) comprises a rectification unit (3606), the rectification unit
(3606) may rectify the signal being received by the signal receiving unit (3602), and may
comprise a full-wave rectifier or a half-wave rectifier. In variations that include an amplitude
limiting unit (3604), the amplitude limiting unit (3604) may limit the amplitude of the
stimulation current that is delivered to tissue. For example, the amplitude limiting unit
(3604) may comprise one or more zener diodes, current limiting elements, or the like, which
may clip or otherwise limit the amplitude of the signals within the stimulation circuit. For
example, in some variations the output signal produced by a controller may be larger than the
intended stimulation signal amplitude to account for potential alignment differences between
the output stage of the controller and the receiving unit of the microstimulator. In these
variations, an amplitude limiting unit (3604) may clip the excess power received by the
receiving unit (3602). While shown in FIG. 36 as being included in the signal conditioning
unit (3603), it should be appreciated that an amplitude limiting unit (3604) may be included
in any unit of the stimulation circuit (3600).
          [0084]        The signal conditioning unit (3603) may provide the conditioned
output signal to output unit (3610), which may deliver a stimulation signal to tissue via one or
more electrodes. The amplitude of the stimulation signal delivered to the output unit (3610)
from the signal conditioning unit (3603) may be at least partially controlled by the ramping
control unit (3608). In some variations, the ramping control unit (3608) may comprise a
charging unit (3612) and a field-effect transistor (3614). The signal conditioning unit (3603)
and the output unit (3610) may be connected to the source and drain terminals of the field
                                                 21

    WO 2012/139063                                                            PCT/US2012/032629
effect transistor (3614), and the charging unit (3612) may be connected to the gate terminal of
the field-effect transistor (3614). The voltage provided by the charging unit (3612) to the
field-effect transistor (3614) may determine the current that flows between the signal
conditioning unit (3603) and the output unit (3610). For example, when the charging unit
(3612) is uncharged (which may occur when the receiving unit (3602) initially begins
receiving an output signal from a controller), the field-effect transistor (3614) may prevent
current flow between the signal conditioning unit (3603) and the output unit (3610), thereby
preventing delivery of a stimulation signal to the patient. As the receiving unit (3602)
provides power to the charging unit (3612), the voltage provided to the gate of the field-effect
transistor (3614) increases (e.g., by charging a chargeable component, as will be described in
more detail below), which increases the amount of current that may flow between the signal
conditioning unit (3603) and the output unit (3610). Accordingly, the amplitude of the
stimulation signal provided by the output unit (3610) may increase as the charging unit
(3612) charges, and the amplitude of the stimulation signal may automatically be ramped
upward until the charging unit (3612) is fully charged. The speed of this ramping may be
determined by the rate at which the charging unit (3612) is charged. Additionally, the
charging unit (3612) may be configured to discharge when power is not being supplied
thereto. This may allow the ramping unit (3602) to reset between different treatment
sessions, such that the stimulation circuit can ramp subsequent stimulation signals produced
in subsequent treatments.
           [0085]        FIG. 43 depicts a variation of a stimulator circuit (4320) which may be
configured to passively ramp a stimulation signal provided by the stimulation circuit. As
shown there, stimulator circuit (4320) may comprise a receiving unit (4322), a signal
conditioning unit (4324), a ramping control unit (4326), and an output unit (4328). As
described in more detail above with respect to FIG. 36, the receiving unit (4322) may be
configured to receive an output signal from a controller (not shown), and may transmit the
received signal to the signal conditioning unit (4324) and the ramping control unit (4326). In
the variation shown in FIG. 43, the receiving unit (4322) may comprise a resonant circuit
comprising a coil (4330) connected in parallel with a tuning capacitor (4332). This resonant
may be tuned or otherwise configured to receive an output signal that is transmitted at a
certain frequency or range of frequencies. It should be appreciated, however, that the
receiving unit (4322) may comprise any suitable components that receive an output signal
                                                 22

    WO 2012/139063                                                            PCT/US2012/032629
(e.g., a magnetic field, RF signal, optical signal, ultrasound signal, or the like) and generate a
current or voltage therefrom.
           [0086]       As mentioned above, the signal received by the receiving unit (4322)
may be passed to the signal conditioning unit (4324) and the ramping control unit (4326). In
the variation shown in FIG. 43, the signal conditioning unit (4324) may comprise a
rectification unit (4334), an amplitude control unit (4336), and a current source unit (4338).
It should be appreciated that the signal conditioning unit (4324) may include only some of
these individual components and/or may contain additional components as desired. In
variations that include a rectification unit (4334), the rectification unit (4334) may be
configured to convert any alternating current signals to direct current signals. The rectifying
unit may be a half-wave rectifier or a full-wave rectifier, and in some instances may be
configured to smooth the rectified signal. For example, the variation of rectification unit
(4334) shown in FIG. 43 may comprise a half-wave rectifier comprising a diode (4340) and a
smoothing capacitor (4342) placed at the output of the half-wave rectifier.
           [0087]       In variations that include an amplitude control unit (4336), the
amplitude control unit (4336) may be configured to limit the maximum amplitude of the
signal delivered by the output stage (4328). For example, the amplitude control unit (4336)
shown in FIG. 43 may comprise a zener diode (4344), which may shunt current away from
the signal conditioning unit (4324) when the voltage across the zener diode (4344) exceeds a
threshold voltage. It should be appreciated that the amplitude control unit (4336) may
comprise any suitable current or voltage limiting elements, which may be positioned in any
suitable portion of the stimulator circuit (4300) (e.g., as part of the receiving unit (4322), the
signal conditioning unit (4324), the ramping control unit (4326), the output unit (4328),
combinations thereof, and the like). In some variations, a stimulation circuit may comprise a
plurality of amplitude control units, each of which may limit a different aspect of the
generated stimulation signal, or may limit aspects of the generated control signal at different
locations.
           [0088]       In variations where the signal conditioning unit (4324) comprises a
current source unit (4338), the current source unit (4338) may be configured to act as a
voltage-controlled current source which may output a current based on a voltage input
received by the current source unit (4338). For example, in some variations (such as that
                                                 23

    WO 2012/139063                                                           PCT/US2012/032629
shown in FIG. 43), the current source unit (4338) may comprise a transistor (4346) (e.g., a
JFET, MOSFET, BJT) where the gate and the source of the transistor (4340) are connected
(e.g., via a resistor (4348) or the like). In some variations, the current source unit (4338) may
act as a constant-current source that may provide a constant current when any voltage above a
certain threshold is applied to an input of the current source unit (4338). In some variations,
a current source unit may comprise one or more current-limiting diodes or the like. In some
variations the current source unit (4338) may comprise a current mirror circuit. The current
mirror circuit may be symmetric or asymmetric.
           [0089]        Once the received output signal has been conditioned by the signal
conditioning unit (4324), the signal may be passed to the output unit (4328). The output unit
(4328) may thus deliver the processed signal as an output signal to tissue (4350) via
electrodes (4352). In some variations, the output unit (4328) may be configured to allow for
passive charge balancing. For example, output unit (4328) may comprise a capacitor (4354)
and resistor (4356). The capacitor (4354) may charge when signal conditioning unit (4324) is
delivering current to the output unit (4328) and tissue (4350), and may discharge when the
signal conditioning unit (4324) is not delivering current to the output unit (4328), which may
allow the output unit (4328) to provide a biphasic, charge-balanced, stimulation signal to
tissue (4350). In some variations, the output unit (4328) may comprise a current-limiting
device (not shown) or the like, which may limit the magnitude of the balancing current
produced by the capacitor (4354).
           [0090]        As mentioned above, the ramping control unit (4326) may be
configured to ramp the signal provided from the signal processing unit (4324) to the output
unit (4326). As shown in FIG. 43, the ramping control unit (4326) may comprise a charging
unit (4358) and a field-effect transistor (4360). The field-effect transistor (4360) may be any
suitable transistor (e.g., a MOSFET, BJT, or the like). The signal conditioning unit (4324)
and the output unit (4328) may be connected to the source and drain terminals of the field
effect transistor (4360), and the charging unit (4326) may be connected to the gate terminal of
the field-effect transistor (4360). As mentioned above, the current that passes between the
signal conditioning unit (4324) and the output unit (4328) through the field-effect transistor
(4360) may be dependent on a voltage provided by the charging unit (4326) to the gate
terminal of the field-effect transistor (4360). As such, the ramping control unit (4326) may

be configured to increase the amplitude of the stimulation signal as the charging unit (4326)
charges.
           [0091]        Charging unit (4326) may be configured to increase the voltage
provided to the field-effect transistor (4360) as the receiving unit (4322) receives an output
signal generated by a controller. For example, as shown in FIG. 43, the charging unit (4326)
may comprise a capacitor (4362) which may be charged as receiving unit (4322) receives the
output signal. As the capacitor (4362) charges, the voltage applied to the field-effect
transistor (4360) may increase, which may thereby increase the current that may pass from
the signal conditioning unit (4324) to the output unit (4328). This may result in a ramped
stimulation signal produced by the microstimulator. In some instances, the charging unit
(4326) may comprise a rectifying diode (4364) or other rectification circuit which may rectify
the signal received from the receiving unit (4322). Additionally, the charging unit (4326)
may comprise one or more additional components (e.g., resistors (4366) and (4377), diode
(4368) and transistor (4370), which may control the rate at which the capacitor (4362)
charges and discharges. While the stimulator circuits described above with respect to FIGS.
36 and 43 are passive circuits that passively ramp a stimulation signal without the use of
internal logic or intelligence, it should be appreciated that in some variations a stimulation
circuit as described here may comprise an microcontroller or other internal logic that may
control the ramping of a stimulation signal.
           [0092]        The microstimulators described above may take any of several shapes
and forms. FIGS. 6A-6H illustrate exemplary microstimulators suitable for use with the
stimulation systems described here. It should be appreciated that each of the microstimulators
shown in FIGS. 6A-6H may include any of the circuitry or functionality described in more
detail above (e.g., a passive stimulation circuit), and may be hermetically sealed. The
microstimulators may comprise any suitable materials or combinations of materials, such as,
for example, one or more metals (titanium, niobium, stainless steels, platinum, alloys thereof,
combinations thereof, or the like), one or more polymers, one or more ceramics,
combinations thereof or the like. FIG. 6A depicts one variation of a microstimulator (600)
that is shaped like a capsule with a body and two ends. The body may be relatively straight
with a cylindrical, square, rectangular, trapezoidal or other shaped cross section and rounded,
pointed, or other shaped ends. The capsule-shaped microstimulator (600) may include
electrodes (not shown) at one or more ends and/or along the length thereof, as will be

described in more detail below. The microstimulator may have any suitable dimensions. For
example, in some variations, the length of the stimulator may be between about 6 millimeters
to about 30 millimeters. In some of these variations, the length of the stimulator may be
about 16 millimeters. In some variations, the height of the microstimulator may be between
about 0.5 millimeter and about 2 millimeters. In some of these variations, the height of the
microstimulator may be about 1.5 millimeters.      In some variations, the width of the
microstimulator may be between about 3 millimeters and about 10 millimeters. In some
variations, the width of the microstimulator may be about 5 millimeters.
          [0093]       FIG. 6B depicts another variation of a microstimulator (602) that is
shaped like a capsule having a curved body. In these variations, the curvature of the body
may be configured to accommodate an anatomical structure of a patient, such as a fossa for a
lacrimal gland. It should be appreciated that the body of the microstimulator (602) may have
any suitable ends and cross-sectional shape as described above in relation to the
microstimulator (600) shown in FIG. 6A. Additionally, the microstimulator (602) may
comprise one or more electrodes (not shown), as will be described in more detail below.
          [0094]       While shown in FIG. 6B as having a single curve, it should be
appreciated that the microstimulator (602) may comprise multiple curves. For example, FIG.
6C shows a microstimulator (604) comprising multiple curves. As shown there, the
microstimulator (604) includes a first curve in one direction and a second curve in a second
direction. The curves may be formed in a single plane, as shown in FIG. 6C, or may be
formed in different planes. Additionally, the microstimulator (604) may be a flexible device
or may be configured to conform to an anatomical structure of a patient, such as a fossa for
the lacrimal gland.
          [0095]       FIG. 6D depicts another variation of a microstimulator (606) that is
configured as a planar structure. In some of these variations, the microstimulator (606) may
have a first form when it is being inserted into a patient and manipulated to have a second
form during or after delivery, as will be described in more detail below. The planar
microstimulator (606) may be flexible and/or may be configured to conform to one or more
anatomical structure, such as a fossa for a lacrimal gland.
          [0096]       FIG. 6E illustrates a flexible segmented microstimulator (608) for use
with the stimulation systems described here. The flexible segmented microstimulator (608)

may include multiple electrodes (610) separated by body segments (612). The electrodes
may be implemented as part of a stimulation circuit for stimulating one or more anatomical
targets such as a lacrimal gland. While the microstimulator (608) is shown in FIG. 6E as
forming a single curved such that the electrodes (610) are aligned along the curve, it should
be appreciated that the microstimulator need not form a single curve. For example, FIG. 6F
shows a variation of a flexible segmented microstimulator (614) comprising a plurality of
electrodes (616) connected by body segments (618) such that electrodes (616) extend
approximately parallel to other electrodes (616).
           [0097]         FIGS. 6G and 6H illustrate one variation of a microstimulator (620)
that is incorporated into a contact lens (622). As shown there, the contact lens (622) may be
positioned over an iris (626) of an eye (630) and may comprise one or more electrodes (628).
The contact lens (622) may be in contact with the cornea, and its inner surface may conform
to the shape of the cornea and/or the conjunctiva. The microstimulator (620) may contain
any suitable number of electrodes (628) (e.g., one, two, or three or more electrodes), and may
deliver an electrical current to the surface of the eye, which may result in reflex activation.
           [0098]         In some variations, the contact lens (622) may have a power supply
(e.g., a battery or the like). Additionally or alternatively, the contact lens (622) may comprise
one or more coils (624) or other elements which may receive energy from a controller. FIG.
6H is an enlarged view of the coils (624) shown in FIG. 6G. The microstimulator (620) may
be powered in any suitable manner, such as by one or more of the controllers as described
below. In some variations, the microstimulator (620) may be powered by a magnet placed
within the eyelids. In some variations, the microstimulator may be activated by blinking an
eye, in which case a blink detection mechanism may be used in conjunction with the
microstimulator.
           [0099]         As mentioned above, the microstimulators described here may
comprise one or more electrodes. The electrodes may be attached to any suitable portion or
portions of the microstimulator, and in some instances may be connected to the
microstimulator via one or more leads. In some variations, the electrodes may be configured
to allow for capacitive charge transfer, but not faradaic charge transfer. When the
microstimulator comprises a planar body, such as the microstimulator (606) described above
with respect to FIG. 6D, the microstimulator may include electrodes on both sides of the
                                                  27

    WO 2012/139063                                                         PCT/US2012/032629
planar structure, or may only include electrodes on one side of the planar structure. The
microstimulators may comprise any suitable number of electrodes (e.g., one, two, three, or
four or more electrodes). FIGS. 7A-7F depict illustrative microstimulators having different
electrode configurations. For example, FIG. 7A illustrates a microstimulator (700) including
a stimulation circuit (702) with electrodes (704) coupled thereto. It should be appreciated
that the stimulation circuit (702) shown in FIG. 7A may be any suitable stimulation circuit,
such as one or more of the stimulation circuits described in more detail above. Electrodes
(704) may be coupled to the stimulation circuit (702) at the ends of the microstimulator (700),
as shown in FIG. 7A, or may be connected along the body of the microstimulator (700).
           [0100]       FIG. 7B shows another variation of a microstimulator (706) which
includes electrodes (708) that are attached to the microstimulator (706) via small round
contact points on the exterior of the microstimulator (706). While shown in FIG. 7B as being
attached to the ends of the microstimulator (706), one or more of the electrodes may be
attached along the body of the microstimulator (706). In other variations, the electrodes may
be at least partially embedded or nestled into a surface of the microstimulator. For example,
FIG. 7C illustrates a microstimulator (708) having nestled electrodes (710). While the
electrodes (710) are shown in FIG. 7C as being configured as a circular pattern, it should be
appreciated that a nestled electrode (710) may have any suitable shape and/or pattern.
           [0101]       In some variations, one or more electrodes may be attached to a
microstimulator via one or more leads. The leads may or may not be flexible or comprise one
or more flexible portions. For example, FIG. 7D depicts one variation of a microstimulator
(712) comprising electrodes (714) attached to the microstimulator (712) via flexible leads
(716). The flexible leads (716) may be manipulated into one or more shapes to traverse
through one or more regions of the body and/or conform thereto. FIG. 7E shows another
variation of a microstimulator (718) that includes electrodes (720) attached to the
microstimulator (718) via rigid leads (722). It should be appreciated that in variations where
a microstimulator comprises a lead, the microstimulator may comprise any suitable number
of leads (e.g., one, two, three, or four or more leads), and each lead may include any suitable
number of electrodes (e.g., one, two, three, or four or more electrodes).
           [0102]       In variations where a microstimulator includes electrodes attached to
the body of the microstimulator via one or more leads, the leads may allow for the body of
                                                 28

    WO 2012/139063                                                          PCT/US2012/032629
the microstimulator to be located remotely from the site of stimulation. For example, FIG. 7F
shows one variation of an implanted microstimulator (723) comprising a body (724) and a
plurality of electrodes (728) attached to the body (724) via a lead (726). As shown there, the
electrodes (728) may be configured to deliver a stimulation signal (730) to tissue around the
eye (e.g., the lacrimal gland), but the body (724) (which may include one or more stimulation
circuits) may be remotely positioned (e.g., behind the ear as shown in FIG. 7F, or at another
location in the head, neck, or torso).
           [0103]       As mentioned above, a microstimulator may be configured to change
shape upon implantation from a delivery device. For example, FIGS. 8A and 8B depict one
variation of a microstimulator (800) that is configured to change shape upon implantation
from a delivery device (802) (e.g., a needle or the like). Specifically, the microstimulator
(800) may have a first low-profile form when placed inside of a delivery device. The
microstimulator (800) may be rolled, crimped, folded or otherwise manipulated to achieve
this low-profile form. For example, in FIG. 8A, the microstimulator (800) is shown as being
folded into the first low-profile form.
           [0104]       When the microstimulator (800) is released from the delivery device
(802) (e.g., via a pusher or the like), the microstimulator (800) may take on a second form.
When in its second form, the microstimulator (800) may conform to one or more anatomical
structures, such as a fossa for the lacrimal gland. The microstimulator (800) may transition
between the first and second forms in any suitable manner. For example, in some variations
the microstimulator (800) may unfold, unfurl, or otherwise change shape due to release of
stored energy in the microstimulator (800) (e.g., shape memory energy, spring or coil energy,
or the like). In other instances, the microstimulator (800) may change shape due to
mechanical manipulation, or by virtue of degradation or other removal of a structure holding
the microstimulator (800) in the low-profile form.
           [0105]       In some variations, the microstimulators may comprise one or more
components which may aid in insertion of the device into tissue. For example, in some
variations a microstimulator may comprise one or more rounded edges which may reduce
tissue damage as the microstimulator is advanced into or past tissue. Additionally or
alternatively, a microstimulator may comprise one or more sharpened tips which may aid in
advancing the microstimulator at least partially into or through tissue. For example, FIGS.
                                                 29

    WO 2012/139063                                                        PCT/US2012/032629
9A and 9B show one such variation of a microstimulator (900). As shown in FIG. 9A, the
microstimulator (900) may comprise a beveled tip (902). In some instances, the
microstimulator (900) may be advanced using a delivery device (904), as shown in FIG. 9B,
and the narrowed edge (906) of the beveled tip (902) may cut or otherwise separate tissue as
the microstimulator (900) is advanced using the delivery device (904). While shown in FIG.
9A as being beveled, the tip of a microstimulator may be pointed or otherwise sharpened. It
should also be appreciated that the sharpened tip may comprise one or more barbs, as will be
described in more detail below, which may help to prevent migration after delivery of the
microstimulator.
            [0106]       FIG. 10 shows another variation of a microstimulator (1000) which
comprises a helical barb (1002) extending therefrom. The helical barb (1002) may be
configured such that the microstimulator (1000) may be rotated during delivery to screw the
helical barb (1002) into tissue. This may assist in advancing the microstimulator, and also
may anchor the microstimulator in place relative to tissue.
            [0107]       In variations where a microstimulator comprises a sharpened tip, the
tip may be formed as a single device or may be formed separately from and attached to the
microstimulator. In some variations, the tip may be configured to degrade or otherwise
detach from the microstimulator after implantation. For example, FIGS. 11 A and 11 B show
one such variation of a microstimulator (1100). As shown in FIG. 11 A, microstimulator
(1100) may comprise a body (1102) and a biodegradable pointed tip (1104). The pointed tip
(1104) may aid in delivery of the microstimulator (1100) by puncturing or otherwise
separating tissue during advancement of the microstimulator (1100). Once in place in the
body, the tip (1104) may biodegrade such that the body (1102) of the microstimulator (1100)
is left in place, such as shown in FIG. 11 B. The biodegradable tip may be made from any
suitable biocompatible, biodegradable material or materials, such as one or more
biodegradable sugars or polymers (e.g., PLA, PLGA, or the like).
            [0108]       The microstimulators described here may also comprise one or more
elements which may help to maintain the microstimulator in place relative to tissue. In some
variations, the microstimulator may comprise one or more coatings (e.g., an adhesive coating
or the like) which may help hold in the microstimulator in place relative to tissue. In other
variations, the microstimulator may comprise one or more materials (e.g., a Dacron covering)
                                                30

    WO 2012/139063                                                          PCT/US2012/032629
or structures that may promote tissue ingrowth. In some variations, the microstimulator may
comprise one or more fixation elements, such as hooks, barbs, anchors, bumps, or other
protrusions. For example, FIG. 12 illustrates a microstimulator (1200) having a plurality of
barbed fixation elements (1202). While the fixation elements (1202) are shown in FIG. 12 as
being attached to the body of the microstimulator, it should be appreciated that fixation
elements may be affixed to any suitable portion of the microstimulator. In variations where
the microstimulator comprises a sharpened tip, the tip may comprise one or more fixation
elements. In variations where the microstimulator comprises one or more leads, one or more
of the leads may comprise one or more fixation elements. For example, FIG. 13 depicts
another variation of a microstimulator (1300) which comprises leads (1302) having barbed
fixation elements (1304) located thereon. It should be appreciated that the leads may
comprise any suitable fixation element, such as those described immediately above.
           [0109]        It should be appreciated that a microstimulator may comprise a
plurality of different fixation elements. For example, FIG. 14 illustrates a variation of a
microstimulator (1400) comprising a plurality of bumps (1402) and ring members (1404)
protruding from the microstimulator (1400). In these variations, the bumps (1402) and the
ring members (1404) may resist movement of the microstimulator (1400) relative to tissue.
Additionally, the ring members (1404) may promote tissue ingrowth which may further help
hold microstimulator (1400) in place relative to tissue. Additionally or alternatively, one or
more sutures (not shown) may be threaded through the ring members to help sew the device
in place relative to tissue. The microstimulator may comprise any suitable combination of
fixation elements as described above.
           [0110]        In some variations of the microstimulators described here, the
microstimulator may comprise one or more features to facilitate minimally invasive retrieval.
For example, FIGS. 15A-15C depict illustrative variations of microstimulators that include
retrieval features. 15A shows a variation of a microstimulator (1500) comprising a recapture
loop (1502). The recapture loop (1502) may comprise an aperture (1504), and may aid in
retrieval of the microstimulator (1500). Specifically, during retrieval, a physician may use a
retrieval device such as forceps or a hook device to engage recapture loop (1502) and remove
the microstimulator (1500) from its position within the body. In some variations, a suture
(not shown) may be attached to the recapture loop (1502), and the suture may be engaged by
a physician (e.g., via a retrieval device) to pull the microstimulator (1500) from its position.

    WO 2012/139063                                                          PCT/US2012/032629
A microstimulator may or may not comprise multiple recapture loops (1502), and these
recapture loops may be located at one or both ends of the microstimulator (1500), and/or
along the length of the body of the microstimulator (1500). While the microstimulator is
shown in FIG. 15A as having a capsule-shaped body similar to the microstimulator (600)
described above with respect to FIG. 6A, it should be appreciated that any microstimulator
described here may comprise a recapture loop.
           [0111]       FIG. 15B illustrates another variation of a microstimulator (1510)
having a recapture magnet (1512). Recapture magnet (1512) may be engaged by another
magnetic device to assist in removal or repositioning of the microstimulator (1510). It should
also be appreciated that the recapture magnet (1512) may also be engaged by a delivery
device and may assist in positioning the microstimulator (1510) during delivery.
           [0112]       FIG. 15C illustrates another variation of a microstimulator (1520)
having a shaped retrieval tab (1522). Also shown there is a retrieval device (1524) having an
aperture (1526) at a distal end thereof. To aid in retrieval of the microstimulator (1520), the
retrieval device (1524) may be advanced so that the aperture (1526) receives a portion of the
retrieval tab (1522) in the aperture (1526), and may be rotated to temporarily connect the
microstimulator (1520) and the retrieval device (1524). Once connected, the retrieval device
(1524) may be manipulated or withdrawn to reposition or remove the micro stimulator.
           [0113]       FIGS. 42A-42C illustrate another variation of a microstimulator (4200)
described here. Specifically, FIG. 42A shows a perspective view of the microstimulator
(4200). As shown there, the microstimulator (4200) may comprise a housing (4202) and a
flexible extension (4204) connected to the housing (4202). The housing (4202) may be
hermetically sealed, and may contain some or all of the stimulation circuitry therein. The
microstimulator (4200) may comprise any stimulation circuits, such as those described above.
The housing (4202) may be formed from one or more metals (e.g., titanium) or other
biocompatible materials.
           [0114]       The extension (4204) may be formed from a flexible material such as
silicon, and may comprise a first electrode (4206), a second electrode (4208), and a coil
(4210). In some variations, the extension (4204) may be a molded component, such as
molded silicon. The flexible extension (4204) may conform to one or more portions of the
anatomy (e.g., the orbit or the lacrimal gland) when implanted in tissue. FIG. 42B shows a
                                                32

    WO 2012/139063                                                          PCT/US2012/032629
side view of the microstimulator (4200). As shown there, the thickness of the extension
(4204) may be less than that of the housing (4202), and may taper to the thickness of housing
(4202). It should be appreciated that in some variations the thickness of the extension (4204)
may be the same as or greater than the thickness of the housing (4202). Additionally, the
width of the extension (4204) is shown in FIG. 42A as being greater than the width of the
housing (4202), and may taper to the thickness of the housing (4202). In some variations,
however, the housing may have the same width, or may be wider than the extension.
           [0115]        While shown in FIG. 42A as having two electrodes, it should be
appreciated that the microstimulator (4200) may comprise any suitable number of electrodes
(e.g., one, two, three, or four or more electrodes). Some or all of the electrodes may be
textured or patterned, which may enhance the effective surface area of the electrodes. One or
more of the electrodes may be recessed, which may provide for more uniform charge density
on the electrode surface. In the variation shown in FIG. 42A, the first electrode (4206) and
second electrode (4208) are positioned on the same side of the extension (4204), although in
some variations the first (4206) and second (4208) electrodes may be positioned on opposite
sides of the extension (4204). Additionally, while shown in FIG. 42A as having a coil
(4210), it should be appreciated that the microstimulator (4200) may comprise any energy
receiving element or elements as described in more detail below.
           [0116]        The electrodes (4206) and (4208) and coil (4210) may be connected to
the microstimulator circuitry via one or more feedthroughs. For example, FIG. 42C shows a
perspective view of the housing (4202) with the extension (4204) removed. As shown there,
housing (4202) may comprise a plurality of feedthroughs (4212) that extend through the
housing (4202). One or more elements (e.g., one of the electrodes (4206) or (4208) or the
coil (4210)) may be electrically connected to the hermetically-sealed stimulation circuitry by
connection to the feedthroughs (4212). Additionally, some of the feedthroughs (4212) may
comprise an insulating member (4214) which may electrically isolate the feedthrough (4212)
from the housing (4202).
           [0117]        The microstimulators described here may be made from any materials
or combinations of materials. For example, the composition of the electrode may include, but
is not limited to, platinum, iridium, platinum iridium, iridium oxide, sputtered iridium oxide,
titanium nitride, tantalum, and combinations thereof. In some variations, the implantable
                                                33

    WO 2012/139063                                                        PCT/US2012/032629
microstimulators described here may be configured to be compatible with magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) machines. In some of these variations, the device may be
configured to minimize device movement that may result from magnetic forces created
during MRI imaging or minimize heating that may occur in the components of the
microstimulator. For example, in some variations, the microstimulator may be made from
non-ferromagnetic or reduced-ferromagnetic materials. In other variations, the
microstimulator may comprise ferromagnetic materials, but the relative amount of these
components may be small enough such that forces provided on these components during MRI
imaging do not substantially move the device. In other variations, the microstimulators may
be configured such that MRI imaging does not cause inadvertent stimulation or other
activation of the microstimulator. For example, when the microstimulators comprise a
receiving circuit having a resonant frequency (as discussed in more detail above), the
microstimulator may be configured such that the resonant frequency is outside of the
frequency ranges produced during MRI imaging (e.g., the frequencies produced by the main
field, gradient field, and/or RF fields of an MRI scanner).
           [0118]        In some variations, the microstimulator may comprise one or more
sensors which may measure one or more physical parameters of the patient. In some
variations, the sensors may be used to implement closed loop stimulation of one or more
anatomical structures. FIG. 37 illustrates a microstimulator implemented with closed loop
control of lacrimal stimulation. As shown there, a microstimulator (3706) may include
sensors (3708) and an electrode-bearing lead (3704). The sensors (3708) may be positioned
on the patient's eyeball, and the lead (3704) may extend between microstimulator (3706) and
one or more anatomical targets, such as a lacrimal gland (3710). The microstimulator (3706)
may be configured to stimulate the anatomical targets via lead (3704) based on closed-loop
stimulation using signals measured by the sensors (3708). When stimulated by one or more
signals, tears may be produced under the upper eye lid (3720) and may travel over an iris
(3700) of the patient's eye assembly. In variations where the microstimulator comprises a
sensor, the microstimulator may be configured to transmit information received from the
sensor to a controller.
           [0119]        Closed loop stimulation may work by detecting a condition (surface
impedance to detect wetness) that provides information about the requirement of tear
production and generating a condition signal. The microstimulator (or controller) may then
                                                 34

    WO 2012/139063                                                         PCT/US2012/032629
modulate its output in response to this condition signal to modify its output in tear
production. Detecting the condition may include measurement of one or more variables.
Measured variables for use in the closed loop stimulation may include one or more of tear
conductivity, tear volume, and gland conductivity. A sensing element may be part of an
implantable microstimulator, or could be separate (e.g., provided in a contact lens, part of the
controller, etc.) from the implanted microstimulator. The adjustment of stimulation output
may be based on an algorithm.
          Controller
          [0120]        As mentioned above, the stimulation systems described here may
comprise a controller, which may communicate with the stimulation devices described here
to transmit and/or receive power, information, or the like. The components of the controller
and the microstimulator may be implemented as a single device or as separate devices. The
controller may communicate with the microstimulator wirelessly and/or via a wired
connection. The controller may be configured for implantation within the body, or may be
configured to remain external to the body. The controller may be disposable, may be
reusable, or may be partially reusable. In some instances, one or more components of the
microstimulator may be reusable, while other components may be disposable. In some
instances, the controller may be rechargeable.
          [0121]        When the controller is configured to remain external to the body, the
controller may be configured to be at least temporarily affixed to the patient. For example,
the controller may be configured to adhesively affix to the patient's skin, may be
magnetically attached to a patient's skin (e.g., via one or more magnets positioned in the
patient's head), may be incorporated into a pair of eyeglasses, may be configured to be worn
over or otherwise attach to the ear, may be incorporated into or otherwise couple to a wrist
watch or bracelet, or the like. The controller may be configured for placement against any
suitable skin surface, such as the temple, forehead, brow, ear, neck, or the like, as may be
appropriate to position a controller in proximity to an implanted stimulator. In other
variations, the controller may comprise one or more hand-held devices, such as a key fob.
          [0122]        In some variations, the controller may comprise a patch or similar
structure which may be configured to at least temporarily affix the controller to a patient.
FIG. 16A shows one such variation of a stimulation system (1600) which includes a

controller (1602) configured to adhesively affix to the skin (1604) of a patient (1606). As
shown there, the controller (1600) may comprise a patch (1608) with one or more adhesive
layers (not shown) which may temporarily connect the patch (1608) to the patient (1606).
The controller (1602) may communicate with a microstimulator (1610) via a wireless signal
(1612), as described in more detail below. The microstimulator (1610) may in turn provide
an output signal (1614) for stimulating one or more anatomical targets of a patient, as
described hereinthroughout.
           [0123]       FIG. 16B shows a cross-sectional side view of one variation of a
controller (1620) which comprises a patch (1622). As shown there, the patch (1622) may
comprise a base layer (1624), controller circuitry (1626), a coating layer (1628), an adhesive
layer (1630), and a release liner (1632). The release liner (1632) may be peeled off or
otherwise removed from adhesive layer (1630), and the patch (1622) may be placed against a
surface (e.g., the skin of a user) to temporarily affix the patch (1622) thereto via the adhesive
layer (1630).
           [0124]       While the controller circuitry (1626) is shown in FIG. 16B as being
separate from base layer (1624) and coating layer (1628), it should be appreciated that the
circuitry of a controller may be incorporated into any portion of the patch. For example, in
some instances at least some of the controller circuitry may be incorporated into one or more
layers of the patch (e.g., a base layer, coating layer, adhesive layer, combinations thereof, or
the like). In variations where a patch comprises a base layer, the base layer (or one of the
other patch layers) may include one or pads or fabric layers, which may provide additional
comfort to a patient when a controller is attached thereto. Additionally or alternatively, the
base layer may comprise a printed circuit board which incorporates one or more components
of the controller circuitry.
           [0125]       While the patch (1622) is shown in FIG. 16B as having a coating layer
(1628), it should be appreciated that a patch need not have any coating layer, or may be have
multiple coating layers. In variations where a patch comprises one or more coating layers,
the coating layers may provide one or more useful functions. In some instances, a coating
layer may comprise a material (which may be a soft durometer material) such as silicone,
latex, parylene, one or more plastics, etc., and may be configured to protect one or more
device components, such as the controller circuitry. The coating layer may, in some
                                                 36

    WO 2012/139063                                                           PCT/US2012/032629
instances, be configured to provide additional comfort to a patient. In some variations, the
coating layer may be configured to prevent accidental removal of the patch. Additionally or
alternatively, the patch may comprise an insulating coating layer (e.g., a layer made from
latex, parylene, or the like), which may help maintain hermeticity of the patch and/or insulate
a patient from voltages generate within the device. Additionally or alternatively, the patch
may comprise a layer which may intensify or direct a magnetic field produced by the
controller, and/or may reduce eddy current loss. These layers may comprise one or more
ferrites, patterned ferrites, or the like.
           [0126]        In some variations, a coating layer may be disposed between different
components of the controller circuitry. For example, FIG. 44 shows an exploded view one
such variation of a patch (4400). As shown there, patch (4400) may comprise a circuit board
(4402), a reflective layer (4404), and a coil (4406). The reflective layer (4404) may be
positioned between the circuit board (4402) and the coil (4406), and may be configured to
shield the components of the circuit board (4402) from a magnetic field created by the coil
(4406) during generation of an output signal. For example, the reflective layer (4404) may
minimize eddy currents that may be created in circuit components of the circuit board (4402).
Additionally, the reflective layer (4404) may shape or otherwise direct the generated
magnetic field away from the reflective layer (4404), which may increase the power
transmission to an implanted microstimulator. The patch (4400) may comprise one or more
adhesive layers or other layers as discussed in more detail hereinthroughout.
           [0127]        It should be appreciated that one or more of the patch components may
be flexible and/or may be configured to at least partially conform to the contours of the
patient. For example, the circuitry of the controller may be incorporated into a flexible
substrate or layer (e.g., a flexible circuit board). In variations where a patch comprises one or
more pads or fabric layers, these layers may be flexible. The patch may also be formed from
one or more translucent materials, or may be colored to match a patient's skin tone, which
may make the patch less noticeable.
           [0128]        As discussed above, the patch may comprise one or more adhesive
layers for affixing the controller to a surface. In some variations, the adhesive layer may
comprise a double-sided adhesive, in which one side of the adhesive adheres to one or more
patch components (e.g., a fabric layer, printed circuit board, or the like) and the other side of
                                                  37

    WO 2012/139063                                                           PCT/US2012/032629
the adhesive adheres to the skin. An adhesive layer may be configured to last any suitable
amount of time. In some variations, the adhesive layer may be configured to last for one or
more hours (e.g., one hour, four hours, eight hours, or the like), one or more days (e.g., one
day, two days, three days, etc.), or one or more weeks (e.g., one week, two weeks, etc.). The
patches described here may further comprise a release liner, but need not. In variations that
do comprise a release liner, the release liner may comprise a wax-coated paper or other
material that temporarily covers an adhesive layer. The release liner may be peeled off or
otherwise removed to expose a surface of the adhesive layer, thereby allowing the adhesive
layer to be placed against skin or another desired surface. In some variations, the controller
may be configured such that removal of a release liner activates one or more functions of the
device. For example, in some variations, removal of a release liner may initiate the
generation of a timed output signal, as will be described in some detail below.
          [0129]         As mentioned above, in some variations a patch may comprise
multiple adhesive layers. FIG. 16C shows on such example of a controller (1640) comprising
a patch (1642) having a first adhesive layer (1644) and a second adhesive layer (1646). Also
shown there is a first release liner (1648) positioned between the first and second adhesive
layers, and a second release liner (1650) covering the second adhesive layer (1646). In these
variations, the different adhesive layers may be used to attach the patch (1642) to a patient
during different time periods. For example, the second release liner (1650) may be removed
to expose second adhesive layer (1646), and the controller may be attached to a patient or
other surface via the second adhesive layer (1646) for a first period of time. After this period
of time, the first release liner (1648) may be removed to remove what may remain of the
second adhesive layer (1646) and to expose the first adhesive layer (1644). The controller
may then be reattached to the patient or other surface via the first adhesive layer (1644). In
this way, multiple adhesive layers may allow for continued use of a controller, even after one
or more of the adhesive layers have already been used. For example, in some variations a
controller may comprise a plurality of adhesive layers separated by respective release liners.
The patient may remove a release liner and use the exposed adhesive layer to attach the
controller to the patient for one treatment period (e.g., at night while the patient sleeps). The
controller may be removed following the treatment period, and a new adhesive layer may be
utilized each time the patient wishes to reattach the controller. In some instances, one or
more portions of the release liner may be labeled to indicate which day of the week a specific
adhesive layer should be removed.

    WO 2012/139063                                                          PCT/US2012/032629
           [0130]       It should be appreciated that in variations where a patch comprises
multiple adhesive layers, each adhesive layer may comprise the same adhesive, or different
layers may comprise different adhesives. Additionally or alternatively, each of the adhesive
layers may be configured to last the same amount of time, or different adhesive layers may be
configured to last for different amounts of time. Additionally, when a controller comprises
multiple release liners covering multiple adhesive layers, it should be appreciated that
removal of some or all of the release liners may activate one or more functions of the
controller. In some of these variations, removal of each release liner may activate a function
of the controller. For example, removal of a first release liner may initiate the generation of a
first timed output signal, and removal of a second release liner may initiate the generation of
a second timed output signal. In other variations, removal of some release liners may activate
one or more controller functions, while removal of other release liners does not alter the
controller function. For example, in some variations, removal of a first release liner may
initiate the generation a first timed output signal, but removal of subsequent release liners
does not affect operation of the controller.
           [0131]       In some variations of the stimulation systems described here, a
controller may be incorporated into a pair of eyeglasses. FIGS. 17A and 17B illustrate two
such variations of controllers for use with the stimulation systems described here. FIG. 17A
shows a stimulation system (1700) which includes a controller (1702) which is embedded
within the frame of a pair of eyeglasses (1704). The controller (1702) may generate an
output signal (1706) which may be received by an implanted microstimulator (1708). The
implanted microstimulator (1708) may generate a stimulation signal (1710) used to stimulate
an anatomical target, as described in more detail below. The controller (1702) may be
embedded into any suitable portion of the eyeglasses (e.g., the frame, a nose piece, etc.).
           [0132]       While the controller (1702) shown in FIG. 17A is embedded within a
pair of eyeglasses (1704), it should be appreciated that in some instances a controller may be
attached to a pair of eyeglasses. For example, FIG. 17B shows another variation of a
stimulation system (1720) comprising a controller (1722) which is attached to the frame of a
pair of eyeglasses (1724). Controller (1722) may be temporarily or permanently attached to
eyeglasses (1724), and may be attached in any suitable manner. In some variations, the
controller (1722) may be attached to the pair of eyeglasses (1724) via one or more adhesives.
In other variations, the controller (1722) may be configured to clip to or otherwise
                                                 39

   WO 2012/139063                                                             PCT/US2012/032629
mechanically connect to the eyeglasses (1724). In some instances, the controller (1722) may
be configured to slide over one or more portions of the eyeglasses (1724) In instances where
a controller is releasably attached to a pair of eyeglasses, the controller can be replaced
without needing to replace components of the eyeglass (1724). Additionally, if a patient
wishes to switch between different pairs of eyeglasses (e.g., between un-tinted lenses and
sunglasses), a releasably-attachable controller may be switched between the different
eyeglasses. The controller (1722) may generate an output signal (1726), which may be
received by an implanted microstimulator (1728). The implanted microstimulator (1728)
may generate a stimulation signal (1730) which may be used to stimulate an anatomical
target, as described in more detail below.
           [0133]       In other variations, a controller may be incorporated into a device
which may be worn over or behind the ear of a user. For example, FIG. 18 shows one such
example of a stimulation system (1800) comprising a controller (1802) which may be worn
over the patient's ear near the mastoid region (1804) of the temporal bone. In some
instances, the controller (1802) may comprise one or more adhesives to help hold the
controller (1802) in place relative to the ear. The controller (1802) may generate an output
signal (1806) which may be received by an implanted microstimulator (1808). The implanted
microstimulator (1808) may generate a stimulation signal (1810) used to stimulate an
anatomical target, as described in more detail below.
           [0134]       In still other variations, the controller may be attached to a portion of
the ear itself. For example, FIG. 19 shows one such variation of a stimulation system (1900)
that includes a controller (1902) comprising an earring (1904) which may be attached to the
ear of a patient. The controller (1902) may generate an output signal (not shown) received by
a portion of an implanted microstimulator (1906). The implanted microstimulator (1906)
may generate a stimulation signal (1908) used to stimulate an anatomical target, such as the
microstimulator (723) described above with respect to FIG. 7F.
           [0135]       In some variations, a controller may be configured for placement in the
fornix of an eye under the eyelid. For example, FIG. 20 shows one variation of a stimulation
system (2000) that includes a microstimulator (2002) and an implantable microstimulator
(2004) and a controller (2006) placed in the fornix under the upper eyelid (2008) of a patient.
The controller (2006) may be flexible and/or conformable, and may be shaped to match or
                                                  40

    WO 2012/139063                                                            PCT/US2012/032629
accommodate the curvature of the eyeball and/or fornix. In some variations, the controller
(2006) may be rechargeable. In some variations, the controller (2006) may be disposable.
While the microstimulator (2002) is shown in FIG. 20 as being positioned on the lacrimal
gland (2010), it should be appreciated that a fornix-based controller may be used with a
microstimulator positioned in any suitable location. In some variations, a fornix-based
controller may be attached to or incorporated into a contact lens which may be worn by the
patient. It should also be appreciated that one or more microstimulators may be configured
for placement in the fornix.
           [0136]       FIG. 21 depicts another exemplary external controller for use with the
stimulation systems described here. As shown there, a stimulation system (2100) includes a
controller (2102) comprising a hand-held device (2104). The controller (2102) may be
brought to the vicinity of an implanted microstimulator (2106), and may produce an output
signal (2108) received by the implanted microstimulator (2106). The implanted
microstimulator may in turn generate a stimulation signal (2110) used to stimulate an
anatomical target, as described in more detail below. The hand-held device may be
configured as a key fob, a wrist watch, or another suitable structure.
           [0137]       As mentioned above, some variations of the stimulation systems
described here may comprise an implantable controller. For example, FIG. 22 depicts one
variation of a stimulation system (2200) comprising an implantable controller (2202) and an
implantable microstimulator (2204). Implantable controller (2202) may produce an output
signal (2206), which may be received by the implantable microstimulator (2204). The
implantable microstimulator (2204) may in turn generate a stimulation signal (2208) used to
stimulate an anatomical target. In instances where the implantable microstimulator (2204) is
implanted in a target location where space is limited, a remotely positioned implantable
controller (2202) may allow for circuitry or other components to be implanted in a patient
without having to be positioned at the target location. While the implantable controller
(2202) is shown in FIG. 22 as being implanted in the head of a patient, it should be
appreciated that the implantable controller (2202) may in any suitable location of the body
(e.g., the head, neck, torso, or the like). It should be appreciated that in instances where a
stimulation system (2200) comprises an implantable controller (2202), the stimulation system
(2200) may comprise one or more external devices (such as one or more of the controllers
described above) which may be configured to provide programming instructions to the
                                                  41

    WO 2012/139063                                                             PCT/US2012/032629
implantable controller (2202) and/or may recharge the implanted controller (2202) in
variations where the implanted controller (2202) comprises a rechargeable power source.
           [0138]       In still other variations, some or all of the controller components may
be incorporated into an implantable stimulation device. For example, in some variations a
stimulation device may comprise an implantable pulse generator with an internal power
source. FIG. 23A depicts one variation of a stimulation system (2300) comprising an
implantable microstimulator (2302). As shown there, the implantable microstimulator (2302)
may comprise a pulse generator (2304) connected to a lead (2306) that comprises a plurality
of electrodes (2308). The lead (2306) may be positioned such that the electrodes (2308) may
be positioned adjacent to or in the lacrimal gland (2310), although it should be appreciated
that the electrodes (2308) may be positioned near any suitable tissue as described in more
detail below. The pulse generator (2304) may comprise one or more batteries or other power
sources, and may be configured to produce one or more stimulation pulses or other signals
that are applied to the electrodes to stimulate one or more desired anatomical targets. While
shown in FIG. 23A as comprising a multi-electrode lead (2306), in some variations the
stimulation device may comprise one or more monopolar electrode leads.
           [0139]       When an implantable stimulation device comprises an implantable
pulse generator with an internal power source, the pulse generator may be implanted in any
suitable location in the body. For example, FIG. 23B shows the stimulation system (2300)
with the pulse generator (2304) implanted near a patient's clavicle bone. The lead (2306) may
extend within the body of the patient from the pulse generator (2304) to a target location
(e.g., the lacrimal gland). In other variations, the pulse generator (2304) may be positioned in
the head or neck. It should be appreciated that in instances where a microstimulator (2302)
comprises an implanted pulse generator (2304), the stimulation system (2300) may still
comprise one or more external devices (such as those described above) which may be
configured to provide programming instructions to the pulse generator (2304) and/or may
recharge the pulse generator (2304) in variations where the microstimulator (2302) comprises
a rechargeable power source.
           [0140]       As mentioned above, the controller may be configured to transmit one
or more signals to an implanted microstimulator. In some variations, the output signal
produced by the controller may provide power to the microstimulator. For example, in
                                                  42

    WO 2012/139063                                                          PCT/US2012/032629
variations in which a stimulation system comprises a microstimulator having a passive
stimulation circuit (or a stimulation circuit that does not otherwise include a battery or
internal power supply), the controller signal may power the stimulation device. In variations
in which a microstimulator of a stimulation system comprises a power source, the signal of
the controller may temporarily provide power to the microstimulator to assist in
microstimulator operation and/or to recharge the power supply of the microstimulator. In
variations where a stimulation system comprises an implanted controller, an external
controller may provide a signal to recharge or otherwise power the implanted controller.
           [0141]       In some variations, one or more of the signals produced by the
controller may transmit information to one or more portions of the stimulation system. For
example, in variations where a stimulation system comprises a microstimulator having an
implantable pulse generator, the controller may provide programming instructions (e.g.,
stimulation parameters, stimulation times, etc.) to the implantable pulse generator. Similarly,
in variations where a stimulation system comprises an in implanted controller, an external
controller may be configured to provide one or more control signals or other information to
the implanted controller. In variations where a microstimulator comprises an adjustable
component, one or more output signals of the controller may be used to adjust the adjustable
component.
           [0142]       FIG. 30 depicts a schematic diagram of one variation of a controller
(3000) circuit suitable for use with the stimulation systems described here. As shown there,
the controller (3000) may include a power source (3002), an input module (3004), a
controller (3006), and a transmission component (3008). The power source (3002) may
provide a voltage or current to the controller (3006). The supplied power may be a constant
voltage or current or an alternating voltage or current.
           [0143]       Input module (3004) may provide one or more inputs signals to
controller (3006) based on input received from a user such as a patient, a health professional,
or other external source. For example, the user input may be a depressed button, an input
along a slide bar, or some other input that indicates whether to apply stimulation to one or
more anatomical targets (such as a lacrimal gland), what type of stimulation to apply, and/or
what stimulation parameters to apply. The input signals may also be generated from logic
inside the input module (3004). For example, input module (3004) may include logic to apply
                                                 43

stimulation to a lacrimal gland periodically, in a ramped fashion, continuously, in a patterned
fashion, in response to detecting a condition of low or decreased tear production, or some
other condition. In some variations the stimulation may be ramped to prevent activation of
pain sensation.
           [0144]       Controller (3006) may receive power from power source (3002) and
input signals from input module (3004) to generate an output signal. The output signal may
be a voltage signal or a current signal applied to transmission element (3008). The output
signal may vary in frequency, amplitude, period and/or phase based on the input received
from input module (3004) and power received from controller (3002). The transmission
element (3008) may be any element suitable for conveying energy and/or information to a
microstimulator (not shown), such as one or more coils, ultrasound generators, optical energy
generators, or the like. When the output signal is applied to a transmission element (3008)
including a coil, the coil may generate a magnetic wave having a radio frequency and
amplitude based on the output signal and coil. In some variations, the controller (3006) may
detect one or more operating parameters of the microstimulator.
           [0145]       While the controller (3006) is shown in FIG. 30 as having an input
portion, it should be appreciated that the controller need not have an input portion. FIG. 45A
depicts a block diagram of another variation controller circuit (4500) comprising a power
source (4502), a controller (4504), and a transmission portion (4506). As described in more
detail above, the power source (4502) may provide power to the controller (4504). The
controller (4504) may be programmed or otherwise configured to produce one or more output
signals, which may be transmitted to a microstimulator via transmission portion (4506).
           [0146]       FIG. 45B depicts one variation of a controller circuit (4510)
comprising a power source (4512), a controller (4514), and a transmission portion (4516) as
described immediately above. As shown there, the power source (4512) may comprise a
battery (4518) in parallel with a capacitor (4520), although it should be appreciated that the
power source (4512) may include any suitable elements. In this variation, the battery (4518)
may continuously charge the capacitor (4520), and the capacitor (4520) may provide current
to the controller (4514) during generation of an output signal when the electrochemical
reactions of the battery (4518) is not fast enough to provide the amount of current required to
generate the output signal. The power source (4512) may or may not be rechargeable.

    WO 2012/139063                                                         PCT/US2012/032629
          [0147]        The power source (4512) may provide power to the controller (4514),
which may generate an output signal. In the variation shown in FIG. 45B, the controller may
comprise a pulse generator (4522), a first transistor (4526) and a second transistor (4524).
The pulse generator (4522) may be connected to the first and second transistors such that
current may flow through only the first transistor (4526) when the pulse generator (4522) is
generating a pulse and may flow only through the second transistor (4525) when the pulse
generator (4522) is not generating a pulse. This may allow for an alternating current to be
generated in the transmission portion (4516). While shown in FIG. 45B as having a pulse
generator (4522) connected to first and second transistors, it should be appreciated that the
controller may comprise a pulse generator connected to an H-Bridge, a microcontroller, or
the like.
          [0148]        The output signal produced by the controller (4514) may be
transmitted to a microstimulator using transmission portion (4516). The transmission portion
(4516) may comprise one or more coils, ultrasound generators, light sources, or the like
which may transmit the output signal. For example, as shown in FIG. 45B, the transmission
portion (4516) may comprise a tuning capacitor (4528) in series with a coil (4530). This
circuit may be tuned such that the pulses generated by the controller (4514) are transmitted at
a specific frequency (e.g., 1 Mhz, or the like).
          [0149]        FIG. 46 shows another variation of a controller circuit (4600) which
may be used to generate a periodic oscillating output signal. As shown there, the controller
circuit (4600) may comprise a voltage source (4602), a resistor (4604), a first capacitor
(4606), a second capacitor (4614), a third capacitor (4616), a bipolar junction transistor
(4608), a transmission coil (4610), and a choke (4612). The voltage source (4602) (e.g., a
battery) may be connected in parallel with the resistor (4604) and the first capacitor (4606),
and the base of the bipolar junction transistor (4608) may be connected between the resistor
(4604) and the first capacitor (4606). A first end of the voltage source (4602) may also be
connected to the transmission coil (4610). A second end of the voltage source (4602) may
also be connected to the choke (4612) and the third capacitor (4616). The collector of the
bipolar junction transistor (4608) may be connected to the transmission coil (4610) and the
second capacitor (4614), and the emitter of the bipolar junction transistor (4608) may be
connected to the second capacitor (4614), the third capacitor (4616), and the choke (4612).

    WO 2012/139063                                                          PCT/US2012/032629
           [0150]         When the voltage source (4602) is connected to the controller circuit
 (4600), the voltage source (4602) may charge the first capacitor (4606) until the bipolar
junction transistor (4608) begins to conduct. While the bipolar junction transistor (4608) is
conducting, an oscillating signal may be passed through the transmission coil (4610) to
produce an oscillating magnetic field. The frequency of the oscillating output signal may be
determined by the inductance value of the transmission coil (4610) and the capacitance
values of the second (4614) and third (4616) capacitors. The choke (4612) may provide DC
biasing during generation of the oscillating output signal. The oscillating signal may
continue until the first capacitor (4606) has discharged through the bipolar junction transistor
 (4608) and the bipolar junction transistor (4608) stops conducting. At this point, the voltage
 source (4602) may recharge the first capacitor (4606), thereby repeating the production of the
oscillating output signal. In this way, the oscillating signal may be continually produced at
 set intervals until the voltage source (4602) is disconnected or otherwise depleted. The
resistance of the resistor (4604) may determine the rate at which first capacitor (4606)
charges, which may determine the delay between subsequent administrations of the
oscillating output signal. In some variations, the resistor (4604) may be adjustable to vary the
delay. Additionally, the capacitance of the first capacitor (4606) may at least partially
determine the duration of the oscillating output signal. In some variations, the first capacitor
 (4606) may be adjustable to vary the oscillating output signal duration.
           [0151]         The voltage source (4602) may be selectively connected to the
controller circuit to determine when the oscillating output signal is produced by the controller
circuit (4600). For example, in variations where the controller circuit (4600) is incorporated
into a patch having a release liner, such as described in more detail above, removal of the
release liner may connect the voltage source (4602) to the controller circuit (4600) (or
otherwise complete the circuit) to initiate the periodic generation of the transmission signal.
In these variations, the voltage source (4602) may comprise one or more batteries which may
power the controller circuit (4600) for a set period of time (e.g., about four hours, about eight
hours, or the like). In other variations, the controller may be configured to disconnect the
voltage source (4602) after a set period of time (or upon some input from a patient). In some
variations, the controller may comprise one or more controllers and/or user inputs which may
control the connection of the voltage source (4602) to the controller circuit (4602).

    WO 2012/139063                                                             PCT/US2012/032629
           [0152]        In some variations, a controller may be configured to output a signal
independent of any feedback from an implanted microstimulator (or another controller). For
example, in some variations, a controller may be configured to produce a pre-set signal for a
pre-set amount of time when the controller is activated (e.g., by depressing a button on the
controller, removing a release liner from an adhesive layer, or the like). In some variations,
as will be described in more detail below, the pre-set signal may be modified by user input.
           [0153]        In other variations, a controller may be configured to alter its output in
response to feedback received from an implanted microstimulator. In some instances, a
controller may be configured to alter its output based on feedback to account for
misalignment or other movement between the controller and the microstimulator. For
example, in some variations, the implanted microstimulator may be configured to transmit to
the controller information regarding the strength of the signal received by the
microstimulator, and the controller may be configured to alter its output in response to the
received information. In other variations, the controller may be configured to detect and
measure a load positioned within a field produced by the controller, and may alter the
strength of the produced field as a function of the measured load. Additionally or
alternatively, the controller may be configured to receive one or more signals measured from
the patient (e.g., a signal indicative of dryness of the eyes), and may be configured to alter the
output of the controller in response to the measured signal. In variations where the implanted
microstimulator comprises one or more adjustable/tunable components, altering the output of
the microstimulator may comprise adjusting the adjustable components.
           [0154]        In still other variations, it may be desirable to allow for a patient to
alter the intensity of stimulation by increasing or decreasing the output strength of the
controller. In some variations, a controller may comprise one or more buttons, sliders, levers,
knobs, or other mechanisms a patient may manipulate to alter the output strength of the
controller. In other variations, a stimulation system may comprise one or more external
programmers which may be used to alter the output of the controller. For example, the hand
held controller (2102) described above in relation to FIG. 21 may be configured to
communicate with and provide programming instructions to one or more other controllers
(e.g., an implanted controller).

   WO 2012/139063                                                            PCT/US2012/032629
           [0155]       In some variations, a controller may comprise one or more safety
elements. For example, in some variations a controller may comprise a temperature sensor
which measures the temperature inside the controller. In these variations, the controller may
be configured to shut down when the temperature inside the controller exceeds a certain
threshold. This may prevent the controller from reaching a temperature which may injure a
patient (e.g., when the patient is holding the controller, when the controller is attached to the
patient, etc.).
           [0156]       In some variations, a stimulation set may comprise a plurality of
controllers, wherein each controller is configured to produce a different output signal. FIG.
24 shows one variation of a controller set (2400), which comprises a plurality of individual
controllers. As shown there, controller set (2400) comprises a first controller (2402), a
second controller (2404), a third controller (2406), and a fourth controller (2408), although it
should be appreciated that a controller set (2400) may comprise any suitable number of
controllers. The controllers of the controller set (2400) may be configured to generate output
signals having different stimulation parameters (e.g., pulse width, stimulation duration, etc.),
such that a patient may select a specific controller to achieve a certain physical effect. For
example, the first controller (2402) may be configured to generate an output signal having a
longer pulse width than an output signal generated by the second controller (2404), and the
second controller (2404) may be configured to generate an output signal having a longer
pulse width than an output signal generated by the third controller (2406). A patient may use
the second controller (2404) to provide a stimulation signal to an implantable
microstimulator. If the stimulation is too intense for the patient, the patient may switch the
second controller (2404) for the third controller (2406) (or the fourth controller (2408), which
may produce a weaker stimulation signal than the third controller (2406)). Conversely, if the
stimulation provided by the second controller (2404) does not achieve the desired physical
effect, the patient may switch the second controller (2404) for the first controller (2402).
           [0157]       In some instances, it may be desirable to deliver a particular
stimulation signal to a patient for a predetermined amount of time. Accordingly, it may be
desirable to configure the stimulation system to provide a controlled "dose" of stimulation to
a patient. For example, it may be desirable to configure a stimulation system to provide
stimulation for a set period of time (e.g., four hours, eight hours, twelve hours or the like).
Accordingly, the controllers described here may be configured to generate an output signal
                                                 48

   WO 2012/139063                                                            PCT/US2012/032629
for a predetermined period of time, which may result in the generation of a corresponding
stimulation signal by a microstimulator implanted in the patient.
           [0158]       In variations where a controller comprises a patch having an adhesive
layer covered by a release line, such as those described in more detail above, the removal of
the release liner may initiate a dose of stimulation therapy. In variations where a stimulation
system comprises a microstimulator having a passive stimulation system, the stimulation
therapy may comprise generating and transmitting an output signal to a microstimulator, as
described in more detail above. In variations where a stimulation system comprises a
microstimulator having an implantable pulse generator, the stimulation therapy may comprise
delivering one or more signals to the implantable pulse generator instructing the
microstimulator to deliver stimulation to tissue. The controller may continue to output the
signal or signals for the duration of the dose of stimulation therapy. In some instances, the
controller may be programmed to shut down or otherwise cease producing signals after a set
period of time. In other instances, a power source of the controller may only have sufficient
charge to power the controller for the duration of the dose of stimulation therapy.
           [0159]       In variations where a patch controller has a plurality of adhesive layers
separated by release liners, removal of each release liner may begin a different dose of
stimulation therapy. For example, it may be desirable for a patient to receive one dose of
stimulation therapy each day. To begin a stimulation dose on the first day, a patient may
remove a first release liner from a first adhesive layer and may affix the controller to a skin
surface via the first adhesive layer. Removal of the first release liner may initiate a first dose
of stimulation therapy, which may be delivered to the patient while the controller is affixed
thereto. The patch may be removed from the patient following administration of the first
dose. On the next day, the patient may remove a second release liner from a second adhesive
layer (which may initiate a second dose of stimulation therapy), and may reaffix the
controller to the skin surface to allow for delivery of the second dose of stimulation therapy.
This may be repeated until each of the adhesive layers of the patch controller has been used,
or until the patient has administered a prescribed number of doses.
           [0160]       In other variations, a plurality of disposable controllers may be used to
deliver a plurality of doses of stimulation therapy. For example, FIGS. 25A and 25B show a
side view and a top view of a controller set (2500) which may be used to deliver a plurality of
                                                 49

    WO 2012/139063                                                           PCT/US2012/032629
doses of stimulation therapy. As shown there, controller set (2500) may comprise a plurality
of stacked patch controllers (2502) attached to a base (2504). Each patch controller (2502)
may comprise a tab (2506) or other structure which may aid in removal of that controller
from the stack. In some instances, one or more portions of each controller (2502) (e.g., the
tab (2506)) may be labeled with a time or day for intended use of that controller (2502), and
that controller (2502) may be configured to provide an output signal configured to provide a
desired treatment for the time or day of intended use. For example, a set of seven controllers
may be labeled Monday through Sunday. The stack of controllers (2502) may be configured
such that removal of a controller from the stack activates the controller (2502) to direct the
delivery of a dose of stimulation therapy (e.g. initiates generation of an output signal).
Removal of the controller from the stack may also expose an adhesive layer that may be used
to affix the patch controller to a skin surface of the patient. After the controller has
completed its dose of stimulation therapy, the controller may be removed and discarded, and
a new controller may be removed from the stack when it is desired to deliver a new dose of
stimulation therapy.
           [0161]       While the controller set (2500) shown in FIGS. 25A and 25B
comprises a stack of controllers, it should be appreciated that in some variations the plurality
of disposable controllers need not be directly connected. For example, FIG. 26 shows
another variation of a controller set (2600) in which a plurality of patch controllers (2602) are
each attached to a base (2604). Each of the controllers (2602) may be configured to activate
when removed from the base (2604) to direct the delivery of a dose of stimulation therapy,
and may be affixed to a patient via an adhesive layer that becomes exposed when the
controller (2602) is removed from the base (2604). In some of these variations, the controller
set (2600) may comprise controllers (2602) that are configured to provide different doses of
stimulation therapy. For example, some controllers of the set may be configured to provide
different stimulation strengths and/or stimulation durations, such that a user may select a
specific controller from the controller set (2600) depending on the desired stimulation.
           [0162]       As mentioned above, the controllers described here may be disposable,
or may be reusable. In some variations, the controller may be configured to prevent
tampering or other modification of device components. For example, in some variations one
or more components of the controller (e.g., a battery, a coil, or the like) may be welded to or
otherwise integrally formed within the controller body such that accessing and/or removing
                                                 50

    WO 2012/139063                                                          PCT/US2012/032629
one or more of these components may disable functionality of the device. This may prevent a
user from improperly trying to replace or modify one or more components of the controller.
In some variations, the controller may be configured such that one or more components of the
controller is disposable, while one or more components of the controller is reusable. For
example, in some variations a controller may be configured such that one or more
components of the controller, such as a battery, adhesive layer, or coil, may be replaced
without needing to replace the entire controller.
           METHODS
           [0163]       Also described here are methods for stimulating tissue. In some
variations, one or more of the stimulation systems described here may be used to deliver
stimulation to one or more anatomical targets. Generally, a microstimulator of the
stimulation system may be implanted within the patient, and may be used to generate a
stimulation signal which is applied to tissue (e.g., via one or more electrodes). In some
variations, the microstimulator comprises a passive stimulation circuit, and the stimulation
signal is passively generated from an output signal generated by a controller. The stimulation
systems and associated methods may be used to treat one or more conditions. In some
variations, the stimulation systems may be configured to treat one or more ocular conditions.
For example, the stimulation systems described here may be configured to treat dry eye.
           [0164]       For the purposes of illustration, FIGS. 27A-27D depict various views
of the anatomy of the head of a patient. FIG. 27A illustrates the lacrimal (or lachrymal)
apparatus, the physiological system that contains the structures of the orbit for tear production
and drainage. Shown there is an eye (2730) having an upper lid (2720) and a lower lid
(2722). The lacrimal apparatus includes a lacrimal gland (2710), ducts (2712), puncta
(2716), lacrimal ducts (2718), and nasolacrimal duct (2724). The lacrimal gland (2710) may
be innervated by several nerves. These nerves may include the rami lacrimales, the lacrimal
nerve, perivascular nerves of lacrimal artery, and sympathetic nerves fibers and neurites
which innervate the lacrimal gland and its associated vasculature. The lacrimal gland (2710)
may secrete lacrimal fluid (i.e., tears) (2714) which may flow through the ducts (2712) into
the space between the eye (2730) and the upper (2720) and lower (2722) lids. When the eye
(2730) blinks, the lacrimal fluid (2714) may be spread across the surface of the eye (2730).
The lacrimal fluid (2714) may collect in the lacrimal lake (not shown), and may be drawn
                                                51

    WO 2012/139063                                                           PCT/US2012/032629
into the puncta (2716) by capillary action. The lacrimal fluid (2714) may flow through
lacrimal canaliculi (not shown) at the inner corner of the upper (2720) and lower (2722) lids
to enter the lacrimal ducts (2718) and drain through to the nasolacrimal duct (2724). The
lacrimal fluid may drain from the nasolacrimal duct (2724) into the nasal cavity of the
patient.
           [0165]        FIG. 27B illustrates additional anatomical structures around the
lacrimal apparatus. As shown there, the rim of the upper lid (2720) and the lower lid (2722)
contain meibomian glands (2728). The meibomian glands (2728) are sebaceous glands
responsible for the supply of meibum (an oily substance that includes lipids and slows
evaporation of the eye's tear film). Also shown in FIG. 27B is the posterior lacrimal crest
(2734), which is a vertical ridge that divides the orbital surface of the lacrimal bone into two
parts. In front of the posterior lacrimal crest (2734) is a longitudinal groove which unites with
the frontal process (2746) of the skull (2740).
           [0166]        There are two bony depressions in the orbital cavity that may be
referred to as the lacrimal fossa. The first is a smooth, concave shallow depression located on
the inferior surface of each orbital plate of the frontal bone. This depression houses the
lacrimal gland and is referred to as the "fossa for the lacrimal gland" (2730). The second is a
smooth, more deeply concave depression on the lacrimal bone, which forms the medial wall
of the orbital cavity. This depression houses the lacrimal sac and is referred to as the "fossa
for the lacrimal sac" (2732).
           [0167]        The supraorbital process (2744) is a passage in the frontal bone for the
supraorbital artery and nerve. The supraorbital process (2744) is located on the superior and
medial margin of the orbit in the frontal bone. The orbit of the skull (2740) is lined with a
periosteum (not shown) and contains the eye (2730), extraocular muscles for movement of
the eye (2730), veins (not shown), arteries (not shown), and nerves (not shown) which
traverse the orbit into the face and the lacrimal gland (2710).
           [0168]        The extraocular muscles include the lateral rectus (2750), the medial
rectus (not shown), the superior rectus (2752), inferior rectus (2754), superior oblique (2756),
inferior oblique (2758), and the levator palpebrae superioris (not shown). The lateral rectus
(2750) abducts the eye away from the nose and the medial rectus adducts the eye towards the
nose. The lateral rectus (2750) and the medial rectus move the eye only in a horizontal plane.

The superior rectus (2752), inferior rectus (2754), superior oblique (2756), and inferior
oblique (2758) control vertical motion. The levator palpebrae superioris originates on the
sphenoid bone (2736) and is responsible for elevating the upper lid (2720). The malar
process (2726) is a rough projection from the maxilla (not shown) that articulates with the
zygomatic bone (2770).
           [0169]        FIG. 27C shows a front view of the skull, and emphasizes the anatomy
of the orbit with respect to the bones of the skull (2740). FIG. 27D shows an enlarged view
of the left orbit of the skull (2740). As shown there, the exterior to the orbit includes the
posterior lacrimal crest (2734), the supraorbital process (2744), the frontal process (2746), the
sphenoid bone (2736), and the zygomatic bone (2770). The interior of the left orbit includes
the superior orbital fissure (2733), inferior orbital fissure (2735), the fossa for the lacrimal
gland (2780) and the fossa for the lacrimal sac (2732). The structures that enter the orbit
through the superior orbital fissure 33 include the cranial nerves (CN) III, IV, and VI,
lacrimal nerve, frontal nerve, nasociliary nerve, orbital branch of middle meningeal artery,
recurrent branch of lacrimal artery, superior orbital vein, and the superior ophthalmic vein.
The structures that enter the orbit through the inferior orbital fissure 35 include the
infraorbital nerve, zygomatic nerve, parasympathetics to the lacrimal gland, infraorbital
artery, infraorbital vein, and inferior ophthalmic vein branch to pterygoid plexus.
           [0170]        FIG. 28 depicts a flow chart of a method for stimulating an anatomical
target using the stimulation systems described here. This method may be used to treat dry
eye, or one or more other conditions as described in more detail below. First, a
microstimulator may be implanted using an insertion device at step (2800). The
microstimulator may be any suitable micro stimulator, such as one or more of the
microstimulators described in more detail above. The microstimulator may comprise a
passive stimulation circuit, but need not. In variations where the microstimulator comprises a
passive stimulation circuit, the passive stimulation circuit may comprise a ramping control
unit which may passively ramp a stimulation signal produced by the passive stimulation
circuit, as described in more detail below.
           [0171]        The insertion device may be removed from the patient at step (2802).
A waveform signal may be generated at step (2804). The waveform signal may be generated
as an output signal of a controller. The waveform may be generated automatically based on
                                                 53

closed loop control or based on user input received by the controller. A stimulation signal
may be generated from the waveform signal at step (2806). The stimulation signal may be
generated by a microstimulator based on the output signal generated by the controller and
received by the microstimulator. The stimulation signal may then be applied to the
anatomical target at step (2808).
           [0172]        When implanting a microstimulator as mentioned in relation to step
(2800), the microstimulator may be implanted at any suitable location relative to the body. In
some variations, the microstimulator may be implanted in the orbit of the skull adjacent to the
eye. In some variations, the microstimulator may be implanted into about, in proximity to,
within or partially in the lacrimal gland. In some variations, the microstimulator may be
implanted into the fossa for the lacrimal gland. In instances where the microstimulator is
used to treat dry eye, the microstimulator may be used to stimulate one or more nerves that
innervate the lacrimal gland tissue, as will be described in more detail below.
           [0173]        FIGS. 29A-29H depict different implantation locations which may
allow a microstimulator to stimulate the lacrimal gland (e.g., for the treatment of dry eye).
FIG. 29A shows a medial view of an eye within the orbit of a patient's skull. The view of
FIG. 29A corresponds to the view line 29A illustrated in FIG. 27C. Specifically, FIG. 29A
includes the eye (2730) with upper lid (2720) and lower lid (2722), superior rectus (2752),
lateral rectus (2750), inferior rectus (2754), and the lacrimal gland (2710) of FIG. 27C. Also
shown there is the orbital process (2742) of the zygomatic bone, which is a thick, strong
plate, projecting backward and medialward from the orbital margin.
           [0174]        As shown in FIG. 29A (and in an enlarged view in FIG. 29B), a
microstimulator (2900) may be positioned between the portion of the bone forming the fossa
for the lacrimal gland (2780) and the periosteum (2922). The periosteum (2922) of the orbit
of a healthy eye may be tightly attached. In cases of a diseased eye, the periosteum (2922)
may be loosely attached and raised from the bone beneath.
           [0175]        FIG. 29C shows another section medial view of an eye within the orbit
of a patient's skull. The view of Fig. 29C corresponds to the view line 29C illustrated in FIG.
27C. The view of FIG. 29A is lateral and more medial than the view FIG. 29C. FIG. 29C
includes the eye (2730) with upper lid (2720) and lower lid (2722), superior rectus (2725),
lateral rectus (2750), inferior rectus (2754), and the lacrimal gland (2710). In some

variations, as shown in FIG. 29C (and in an expanded view in FIG. 29D) a microstimulator
(2924) may be positioned between the periosteum (2922) and the portion of the bone forming
the fossa for the lacrimal gland (2780), such as shown in FIGS. 29A and 29B.
          [0176]        FIG. 29E is another section medial view of an eye within the orbit of a
patient's skull. The view of Fig. 29E corresponds to the view line 29E illustrated in FIG.
27C. As shown in FIG. 29E (and in an expanded view in FIG. 29F), in some variations a
microstimulator (2926) may be positioned between the periosteum (2922) and the lacrimal
gland (2710).
          [0177]        FIG. 29G is another section medial view of an eye within the orbit of a
patient's skull. The view of Fig. 29G corresponds to the view line 29G illustrated in FIG.
27C. FIG. 29H is another enlarged section view of the inferior edge of the superior orbit
having a microstimulator (2928). The position of microstimulator (2928) is similar to the
positioning of microstimulator (2924) shown FIGS. 29C and 29D, except that the
microstimulator (2928) is shown positioned between the periosteum (2922) and the lacrimal
gland (2710).
          [0178]        FIG. 32 illustrates another implant zone (3200) for a microstimulator
(not shown) or for one or more electrodes of a microstimulator. The microstimulator or
electrodes thereof may be positioned within the fossa for the lacrimal gland of the orbit
between the superior rectus muscle (3202) and the lateral rectus muscle (3204) of the eye
(3205). When positioned there, the microstimulator may selectively stimulate an anatomical
target such as a lacrimal gland (3206) without fully activating the extraocular muscles. For
example, stimulation of the lacrimal gland may be sufficient to produce lacrimation or
vasodilation of glandular blood vessels without engaging the extraocular muscles that would
move the eye in a horizontal or vertical direction.
          [0179]        The microstimulators or electrodes thereof may be positioned in or
adjacent to any of the bony structures and regions of the skull that provide access to one or
more of the anatomical targets specific to the process of lacrimation, such as those shown in
FIG. 27D. Some of the bony structures and regions include, but are not limited to, the
sphenoid bone (2736), inferior orbital fissure (2735), the infraorbital foramen (2762), the
maxillary axis (2764), the nasal-maxillary area (2766), the nasal cavity (2768), the fossa for
the lacrimal sac (2732), the posterior lacrimal crest (2734), the inferior medial aspect of the

supraorbital process (2772), the superior orbital fissure (2733) and the fossa for the lacrimal
gland (2780).
           [0180]        In some variations, one or more microstimulators may be positioned on
a surface of the eye, such as microstimulator (620) described above with respect to FIG. 6G.
Additionally or alternatively, one or more microstimulators or electrodes therein may be
positioned in one or more puncta, lacrimal ducts and/or nasolacrimal ducts. For example,
FIG. 33 shows one variation in which a microstimulator (3300) is positioned at least partially
within a lacrimal duct (3302). In these variations, a current may be delivered to one or more
afferents (e.g., afferents in the ocular surface, afferents in the lacrimal or nasolacrimal ducts),
which may result in reflexive tear production. The microstimulator (3300) may be any of the
microstimulators described in more detail above, and may be powered in any suitable manner
as described in more detail above.
           [0181]        It should be appreciated that any of the microstimulators described
above may be implanted on or adjacent an anatomical target such as a lacrimal gland. FIGS.
3 1A-3 ID illustrate different variations of microstimulators which are positioned on or
adjacent a lacrimal gland of a patient. FIG. 31A is a perspective view of a patient's eye with
one variation of a microstimulator (3100). The microstimulator (3100) may be a planar
pliable microstimulator, such as the microstimulator (606) discussed above with respect to
FIG. 6D. The planar pliable device is shown in FIG. 31A as being positioned on or adjacent
to the lacrimal gland (3102) and has been unfurled such that a surface of the microstimulator
expands over a portion of the surface of the lacrimal gland.
           [0182]        FIG. 3 1B is a perspective view of a patient's eye with another
exemplary microstimulator (3104). The microstimulator (3104) may be a curved
microstimulator, such as the microstimulator (604) discussed above with respect to FIG. 6B.
The curved microstimulator (3104) positioned on or adjacent the lacrimal gland (3102) and
curves to conform to an anatomical structure of a patient, such as the fossa for the lacrimal
gland.
           [0183]        FIG. 3 1C is another perspective view of a patient's eye with an
exemplary microstimulator (3106). The microstimulator (3106) may comprise a flexible
segmented microstimulator, such as microstimulator (608) shown in FIG. 6E. The
microstimulator (3106) may comprise a curved shape which may conform to an anatomical

structure of a patient, such as a fossa for a lacrimal gland, and may comprise a plurality of
electrodes (3108) as described in more detail above.
           [0184]        FIG. 3 1D is another perspective view of a patient's eye with the
microstimulator (4200) described above in relation to FIGS. 42A-42C. As shown there, the
microstimulator (4200) may be position on or adjacent the lacrimal gland (3102), such that
the first (4206) and second (4208) electrodes are facing the lacrimal gland (3102). In some
instances, as shown in FIG. 3 ID, the microstimulator (4200) may be positioned first electrode
(4206) is distally of the second electrode (4208) relative to the upper lid (3110). In these
variations, tissue stimulating currents may be directed out of the first electrode (4206), which
may reduce extraneous tissue stimulation around the conjunctiva (3112). Additionally, as
shown in FIG. 3 1D, the housing (4202) (or another end) of the microstimulator (4200) may
be positioned against or near the conjunctiva (3112), which may facilitate retrieval of the
microstimulator. For example, the housing (4202) of the microstimulator (4200) may be
positioned such that it is visible through the conjunctiva when the upper lid (3110) is lifted.
In some variations, one or more portions of the microstimulator (4200) may be colored to
increase the visibility of the microstimulator (4200). To remove the microstimulator (4200),
a physician may cut the conjunctive overlying the microstimulator (4200), and may grasp the
microstimulator (4200) with a retrieval tool such as forceps.
           [0185]        While discussed above as being implanted in, on, or near one or more
structures around the ocular cavity, it should be appreciated that microstimulators described
here may be implanted in any suitable location. In some variations, a microstimulator may be
implanted in a location to provide stimulation to one or more target nerves. For example, the
microstimulator may be positioned to stimulate an occipital nerve (e.g., to treat headache or
other pain), a vagus nerve (e.g., to treat epilepsy, depression, or the like), a dorsal genital
nerve (e.g., to treat erectile or sexual dysfunction, urinary incontinence, or the like), or the
like. When positioned to stimulate a nerve, in some instances the electrodes of the
microstimulators may be located on the epineurium of a nerve or away from the portion of
the nerve that innervates tissue or gland. An example of a direct nerve stimulator is a nerve
cuff which includes electrodes carried on the inside walls of a cylindrical polymeric sheath.
The nerve cuff may be wrapped around the nerve to bring the electrodes into direct contact
with an isolated portion of a nerve to be stimulated. Indirect stimulation of a nerve may
include delivering low amplitude electrical stimulation via electrodes that are in close
                                                  57

    WO 2012/139063                                                           PCT/US2012/032629
proximity, but not in direct contact, with the nerve to be stimulated. Nerves that are in a
bundle, plexus or innervating tissue or a gland are not isolated from other nerves or
structures. Target nerves or structures that are not isolated may stimulated indirectly by using
electrical selectivity.
           [0186]       In other variations, one or more microstimulators may be implanted in
one or more locations in or around the mouth or salivary glands. For example, in some
variations a microstimulator may be positioned in, on, or around a submandibular gland, a
parotid gland, a sublingual gland, or the like. In these variations, the stimulation systems
may be used to provide stimulation (as described hereinthroughout) to one or more of these
anatomical targets to treat one or more conditions such as dry mouth. The microstimulator
may be implanted using any suitable approach. For example, in some variations, a
microstimulator may be placed subcutaneously to position the microstimulator in, on, or
around the sublingual gland. When positioning a microstimulator in, on, or around the
submandibular gland or the sublingual, the microstimulator may be advanced through the
floor of the mouth, or may be advanced using a submandibular approach. The
microstimulator may be delivered using one or more of the delivery systems described above.
           [0187]       The microstimulators described here may be delivered in any suitable
manner. Described here are delivery systems and methods for delivering a microstimulator to
a region of tissue. The delivery systems generally comprise at least one insertion device, and
in some variations may comprise a dissection tool. Delivery of the microstimulators may be
done under direct visualization and/or indirect visualization (e.g., ultrasound, fluoroscopy, or
the like). FIG. 34 illustrates one instance in which an insertion device (3400) may be used to
implant a microstimulator (3402) into a patient. As shown there, the insertion device (3400)
may insert the microstimulator (3402) through an insertion region near the fossa for the
lacrimal gland. In some variations, the microstimulator (3402) may be secured within the
insertion device (3400) while being positioned within the patient. Once the insertion device
has positioned the microstimulator (3402) at a desired location within the patient, the
insertion device (3400) may deploy the microstimulator (3402) in the patient.
           [0188]       FIG. 35A shows a side view of one variation of an insertion device
(3500) which may be used to deliver a microstimulator (3502). As shown there, the insertion
device (3500) includes a housing (3524), a distal end (3526), and a device shaft (3528). The

microstimulator (3502) may be secured near the distal end (3526) of the insertion device
(3500). Insertion device (3500) may position the microstimulator (3502) at or adjacent an
anatomical target, such as a lacrimal gland, within a patient while the microstimulator (3502)
is secured to the insertion device (3500). In some variations, the insertion device (3500) may
include a needle (e.g., a 12 or larger gauge needle). As shown in FIG. 35B, microstimulator
(3502) may be released from the insertion device (3500) by withdrawing the device housing
(3524) relative to the device shaft (3528) (or by advancing the device shaft (3528) relative to
the device housing (3524)). In some variations the insertion device (3500) may contain
elements for positioning the insertion device in a location which facilitates safe and accurate
delivery of the microstimulator (3502). The insertion device may house the microstimulator
(3502) in a non-needle cannula.
            [0189]        The insertion device may contain one or more energy storage devices
to facilitate insertion, for example a spring. The insertion device may contain an element by
which the implanting physician triggers the insertion or deployment of the microstimulator,
such as a plunger or button. FIG. 38 shows one such variation of an insertion device (3800)
that may be used to deliver a microstimulator (3802), which may one or more of the
microstimulators described above. As shown there, the insertion device (3800) may comprise
a housing (3804) having a piston assembly (3806) and a spring (3808) housed therein, and a
trigger member (3810). The spring (3808) may connect a portion of the piston assembly
(3806) to the housing (3804), such that energy stored in the spring (3808) may move the
piston assembly (3806) relative to housing (3804). For example, as shown in FIG. 38, the
piston assembly (3806) may be retracted such that the spring (3808) may be stretched, and
the piston assembly (3806) may be held in a cocked position (e.g., via the trigger member
(3810)). The trigger member (3810) may be actuated to release the piston assembly (3806)
relative to the housing (3804). The spring (3808) may then bias towards an unstretched
configuration, which may pull the piston assembly (3806) towards the distal end of the
insertion device (3800). As the piston assembly (3806) moves forward, it may advance the
microstimulator (3802) out of the housing (3804), thereby delivering the microstimulator
(3802). While shown in FIG. 38 as being stretched when the piston assembly (3806) is
cocked, in some instances the spring (3808) may be configured such that it is compressed
when the piston assembly (3806) is cocked.

           [0190]       In some variations, the delivery systems may comprise one or more
dissection tools which may be used to form an insertion pathway from outside a patient to a
delivery location for a microstimulator. For example, FIG. 39 shows one variation of a
dissection tool (3900) which may be used to form an insertion pathway into the orbit of the
eye. As shown there, the dissection tool (3900) may comprise a base member (3902) and an
insertion portion (3904). The insertion portion (3904) may include a cutting edge (3906) at a
distal end thereof, which may sever tissue as the dissection tool (3900) is advanced into
tissue. The cutting edge (3906) may include a single bevel, double bevel, a rounded point, or
the like. While shown in FIG. 39 as having a single cutting edge (3906), it should be
appreciated that in some instances the dissection tool (3900) may comprise two or more
cutting edges, which may help the dissection tool (3900) to maintain an intended course
during advancement. In some variations, the insertion portion (3904) may comprise a curved
section (3908) which may allow the insertion portion (3904) to curve around the bony socket
of the skull during insertion. Additionally or alternatively, in some variations, the insertion
portion (3904) may be angled relative to the base member (3902). The angle between the
insertion portion (3904) and the base member (3902) may be any suitable angle (e.g.,
between about 10 degrees and about 170 degrees), and may allow a physician easier access to
the orbit with the insertion portion (3904) without the base member (3902) being blocked or
impeded by the cheek or another portion of the face. In the variation of dissection tool (3900)
shown in FIG. 39, base member (3902) may comprise an aperture (3910) which may allow
the dissection tool to be connected to a handle (e.g., a scalpel handle, an insertion device, or
the like). In other variations, the dissection tool may comprise a handle integrally connected
to the base member. Additionally or alternatively, in some variations, a portion of the
dissection tool (3900) may be configured to vibrate during advancement to assist in cutting
tissue.
           [0191]       FIGS. 40A-40D illustrate a method by which a microstimulator may be
placed on or adjacent the lacrimal gland using the delivery systems described here. Initially,
the upper lid (4002) may be lifted relative to the eye (4000), as shown in FIG. 40A, which
may reveal the conjunctiva. In some variations, the lid may be held open by hand, or using
one or more tools. In some variations an insertion device or dissecting tool may comprise
one or more components which may hold the lid in a lifted configuration. The physician may
locate the lacrimal gland visually and/or or using one or more indirect visualization, and may
advance a dissection tool (4008) to cut the conjunctiva and form an insertion pathway

between the lacrimal gland (4004) and the orbit (4006), as shown in FIG. 40B. The
dissection tool (4008) may be any suitable dissection tool, such as the dissection tool (3900)
described above in relation to FIG. 39. In some variations, the dissection tool (4008) may be
advanced such that it cuts through a portion of the periosteum (not shown) and the insertion
pathway is formed between the periosteum and the orbit (4006). In other variations, the
dissection tool (4008) is advanced such that it does not cut through the periosteum and the
insertion pathway is formed between the periosteum and the lacrimal gland (4004). In still
other variations, the insertion pathway may be formed in a portion of the lacrimal gland
(4004), which may allow a portion of the microstimulator to be positioned within the lacrimal
gland.
           [0192]       Once an insertion pathway is formed, an insertion device (4010) may
be advanced through the insertion pathway. In some variations, the dissection tool (4008)
may be partially or fully withdrawn prior to advancing the insertion device (4010). In some
variations, the insertion device (4010) is advanced along the dissection tool (4008) to
introduce the insertion device (4010) at least partially into the insertion pathway, as shown in
FIG. 40C. Once the insertion device (4010) is in place, a microstimulator (4012) may be
delivered from the insertion device (4010) into the insertion pathway, and the delivery tools
may be removed, as shown in FIG. 40D. In some variations, the insertion device may not be
introduced into the insertion pathway, but may instead push or otherwise advance the
microstimulator (4012) into the insertion pathway over the dissection tool (4008).
           [0193]       While the dissection tool (4008) is shown in FIGS 40A-40D as being
separate from the insertion device (4010), it should be appreciated that in some variations an
insertion device may comprise a dissection tool component which may create an insertion
pathway. In other variations, the dissection tool may be configured to house and eject a
microstimulator, such that the dissection tool may be configured to deliver the
microstimulator.
           [0194]       In some variations, the delivery systems may comprise a guiding
element for helping to direct or otherwise position one or more dissection tools and/or
insertion devices of the delivery system. For example, FIG. 41 depicts one variation of a
guiding element (4100) suitable for use with the delivery systems described here. As shown
there, the guiding element (4100) may comprise a base (4101) and a guide cannula (4102)

    WO 2012/139063                                                            PCT/US2012/032629
extending therefrom. The guide cannula (4102) may comprise a lumen (4104) extending
through the guide cannula (4102) and the base (4101), such that one or more delivery tools
(e.g., a dissection tool, an insertion device, or the like) may be advanced therethrough. The
base (4101) may be positioned on one or more surfaces of the patient (e.g., over the eye, on
the forehead, on the cheek, combinations thereof or the like) to align the guide cannula
(4102) with an insertion site for the microstimulator. In some variations, the angle or pitch of
the guide cannula (4102) relative to the base may be adjustable. Once the guide cannula
(4102) is aligned with the intended insertion site for the microstimulator, one or more
delivery tools may be advanced through the lumen (4104) to deliver a microstimulator to the
insertion site, as described in more detail above. As the delivery tools are passed through the
lumen (4104), the guide cannula (4102) may act to align the delivery tools relative to the
insertion site. This may help provide more accurate placement of the microstimulator relative
to tissue. Additionally, when placed over one or more structures of the body (e.g., the eye),
the base (4101) may protect these bodily structures and may prevent unintended damage to
tissue.
           [0195]        Either during or after placement of the microstimulator, a physician
may test one or more stimulation parameters of the stimulation system. For example, a test
signal may be applied to the patient using the microstimulator, one or more electrodes
incorporated into the delivery system, a percutaneous needle stimulator, or the like. The
physician may assess one or more outcomes of the test signal, such as tear production,
discomfort, sensation, or the like), and may alter stimulation parameters and/or positioning of
the device. For example, in some variations, the microstimulator may be repositioned if the
test signal does not result in adequate tear production, or if the test signal results in
discomfort in the patient. Additionally or alternatively, one or more stimulation parameters
(e.g., pulse width, amplitude, etc.) may be adjusted depending on the results of the test signal.
In some variations, this may comprise adjusting one or more adjustable elements of the
microstimulator, as described in more detail above. The stimulation parameters and/or
positioning of the microstimulator may be repeated as necessary to achieve a desired
stimulation outcome.
           [0196]        Once the microstimulator is in place relative to the body, the
microstimulator may be used to deliver stimulation to one or more tissues. For example,
when used to treat dry eye, stimulation may be applied to the lacrimal gland. The stimulation

    WO 2012/139063                                                          PCT/US2012/032629
may selectively stimulate one or more nerves that innervate the lacrimal gland. In some
variations, the stimulation only stimulates one or more nerves that innervate the lacrimal
gland. In other variations, the stimulation may be applied to tissue in or around the puncta,
lacrimal ducts and/or nasolacrimal ducts.
           [0197]       When stimulating one or more of the nerves or tissues described above,
it may be desirable to stimulate these nerves without stimulating the ocular muscles discussed
above. The autonomic efferent fibers may be selectively stimulated over the sensory afferent
fibers and the A-delta pain fibers. The efferent fibers may be selectively stimulated over the
C pain fibers. In some variations it may be desirable to select a pulse width that stimulates
efferent fibers over pain fibers. In some of these variations, stimulation using short pulse
widths (e.g., 50 psec - 300 ksec) may bias stimulation toward efferent fibers.
           [0198]       The stimulation signal produced by the microstimulator may include a
pulse amplitude, a pulse width, and a pulse frequency. One or more of the pulse amplitude,
pulse width, or pulse frequency may be varied over the treatment period. The stimulation
signal may include a current having a pulse amplitude between about 500 PA to about 25mA.
The stimulation signal may have a pulse frequency between about 2 Hz to about 200Hz. The
pulse frequency may be between about 30 Hz to about 40Hz. The stimulation signal may
include a current having a pulse width between about 50 psec to about 2000 ksec. In some
variations, the stimulation may be adjusted in response to a measured variable. The
stimulation signal may be delivered in bursts and may include a current having a pulse width
between about 100 psec to about 1000 ksec. Stimulation using these stimulation parameters
may be used to treat dry eye, as described herein.
           [0199]       The stimulation may be delivered in a pattern. The patterned
stimulation may be used to ensure the comfort of the patient. The patterned stimulation may
be used to efficacy of the stimulation. The stimulation may be delivered periodically at
regular or irregular intervals. Stimulation bursts may be delivered periodically at regular or
irregular intervals. The stimulation amplitude, pulse width or frequency may be modified
during the course of stimulation. For example, the stimulation amplitude may be ramped
from a low amplitude to a higher amplitude over a period of time. Stimulation amplitude may
be ramped from a high amplitude to a lower amplitude over a period of time. Stimulation
pulse width may be ramped from a low pulse width to a higher pulse width over a period of
                                                63

    WO 2012/139063                                                           PCT/US2012/032629
time. Stimulation pulse width may be ramped from a high pulse width to a lower pulse width
over a period of time. The ramp period may be between 1 second and 15 minutes. The ramp
period may be between 5 seconds and 30 seconds. Stimulation may be delivered at night
time. Stimulation may only be delivered at night time. Stimulation may consist of very high
frequency pulses to block activity in the target tissue. These very high frequency pulses may
be of a frequency between 1,000 Hz and 100,000 Hz.
           [0200]       As mentioned above the stimulation provided by the microstimulator
may be generated in response to an output signal produced by a controller. In these
variations, a controller may be activated to initiate the output signal of a controller, and the
controller may be brought near a receiving portion of the microstimulator to transmit the
output signal to the controller. In some variations, this may comprise connecting or
otherwise affixing the controller to a portion of the anatomy. For example, in variations
where a microstimulator is positioned in, on, or around the lacrimal gland, a controller may
be positioned near the ocular cavity of the patient. For example, in variations where the
controller comprises a patch, the patch may be positioned on the temple, brow, forehead,
cheek, or other suitable location of the patient. The patch may be held in place via an
adhesive (as described in more detail above) or via one or more magnets in the controller
(which may be attracted to one or more magnets positioned within the patient). In variations
where a stimulation system comprises an implanted controller, the controller may be
programmed to output the output signal on a timed basis and/or may be configured to
produce an output signal in response to a signal received from an external programmer.
           [0201]       When the stimulation systems described here are used to treat dry eye
by stimulating one of the anatomical structures listed above, such as the lacrimal gland, it
may be desirable to first evaluate whether the use of the stimulation systems described here is
appropriate for a patient. For example, in some patients, the lacrimal gland may be
irreparably damaged to the point where it is unable to secrete tears. In these variations, a test
may be conducted to evaluate whether the lacrimal gland is capable of secreting tears. In
some variations, one or more stimulation signals may be administered to the lacrimal gland
prior to or during delivery of a microstimulator. For example, a transcutaneous skin
stimulator or a percutaneous needle stimulator may be used to provide a test signal to the
lacrimal gland, and a physician or other user may evaluate a physiological response from the
patient (e.g., tear production). The test signal may be configured such that if administration
                                                64

    WO 2012/139063                                                            PCT/US2012/032629
of the test signal produces a physiological response from the patient, then treatment using the
stimulation systems described here is appropriate for that patient. It should be appreciated
that one or more electrodes may be incorporated into one or more of the insertion devices
described above, such that one or more test signals may be administered during delivery of a
microstimulator to a patient.
           [0202]       When the stimulation systems and methods described above are used
to treat dry eye, it should be appreciated that the stimulation provided by the stimulation
current may be configured to rehabilitate the lacrimal gland. In these variations, a treatment
regimen may be supplied to the lacrimal gland to improve the functioning of the lacrimal
gland over time. In some instances, a treatment regimen may comprise stimulating the
lacrimal gland at predetermined times (e.g., daily stimulation), or the like. The stimulation
provided by the microstimulator may comprise any suitable stimulation parameters, such as
those described in more detail above.
           [0203]       While the methods described above discuss delivering electrical
stimulation to one or more anatomical tissues, it should be appreciated that the stimulation
systems may additionally or alternatively stimulate tissue using one or more chemical,
optical, magnetic, thermal, and/or acoustic stimulation. For example, when the methods
described above are used to treat dry eye, it may be desirable to additionally or alternatively
provide one or more drugs or active agents to one or more of the anatomical structures
described in more detail above (such as the lacrimal gland).      The agents delivered may any
suitable agent or combination of agents (such as pilocarpine or one or more parasympathetic
agents), and may be delivered in any suitable manner. In some variations, the
microstimulator may be configured to release one or more drugs or active agents therefrom.
Additionally or alternatively, a drug-releasing implant may be delivered to the lacrimal gland,
the fossa for the lacrimal gland, the fornix, a lacrimal duct, the eye (e.g., via a contact lens).
For example, one or more biodegradable depots comprising one or more agents (e.g.,
pilocarpine) may be implanted in, on, or near the lacrimal gland. The depot or depots may
comprise one more biodegradable polymers (e.g., PLA, PLGA, combinations thereof, or the
like), and may be configured to release the one or more agents over a certain period of time
(e.g., one weeks, two weeks, one month, or the like). Additional depots may be implanted to
prolong administration of the one or more agents to the lacrimal gland.

    WO 2012/139063                                                            PCT/US2012/032629
           [0204]      In some variations, the methods described here may additionally
comprise providing optical stimulation to an anatomical target such as the lacrimal gland.
For example, optical stimulation may comprise photo-electric activation of a drug (such as a
drug released from one or more of the implants described above), infrared stimulation using a
Vanderbilt/Jensen technique, or the like, or therapy using an optogenetics technique. In some
variations, the methods described here may additionally comprise providing magnetic
stimulation to one or more anatomical targets. For example, in some variations one or more
external magnetic fields may be configured to induce a current in tissue. In some variations,
the methods described here may comprise increasing or decreasing the temperature in or
around a certain tissue to activate or otherwise assist in therapy of that tissue. In still other
variations, the methods described here may comprise providing ultrasound or other acoustic
energy to an anatomical target.
           [0205]      The stimulation systems and methods described above may be used to
treat a number of conditions. For example, the stimulation devices described here may be
used to stimulate one or more tissues in or around the eye to treat one or more conditions,
including but not limited to, allergies, amblyopia, Bell's Palsy, blepharitis, corneal ulcers, eye
occlusions, eye twitch, macular hole, nystagmus, ocular migraine, ocular rosacea, optic
neuritis, photophobia, pinguecula, pterygium, ptosis, strabismus, uveitis, conjunctivitis,
diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma (e.g., via ciliary body/nerve stimulation), keratoconus,
macular degeneration, macular dystrophy, ocular hypertension, retinitis pigmentosa, Stargardt
disease, diplopia, hyperopia, myopia, and presbyopia.
