1.        FIELD OF THE INVENTION
 [0002J   The invention is applicable to the field of prenatal diagnostics and particularly relates to massively parallel
sequencing methods for determining the presence or absence of aneuploidies and/or fetal fraction.
2.        BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
 [00031   Prenatal screening and diagnosis are a routine part of antenatal care. Currently, prenatal diagnosis of
genetic and chromosomal conditions involves invasive testing, such as amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling
(CVS), performed from 11 weeks gestation and carrying a ~1% risk of miscarriage. The existence of circulating
cell-free DNA in maternal blood (Lo et at, Lancet 350:485-487 [1997]) is being exploited for developing
noninvasive processes that use fetal nucleic acids from a maternal peripheral blood sample to determine fetal
chromosomal abnormalities (Fan HC and Quake SR Anal Chem 79:7576-7579 [2007]; Fan et al., Proc Natl Acad
Sci 105:16266-16271 [2008]). These methods offer an alternative and safer source of fetal genetic material for
prenatal diagnosis, and could effectively pronounce the end of invasive procedures.
 [00041   Nucleic acid sequencing is evolving rapidly as a diagnostic technique in the clinical laboratory.
Applications involving sequencing are seen in several areas, including cancer testing encompassing genetic testing
for cancer predisposition and assessment of gene mutations in cancer; genetics encompassing carrier testing and
diagnosis of genetically transmitted diseases; and microbiology encompassing viral genotyping and sequences
associated with drug resistance.
 [0005]   The advent of next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies that allow for sequencing entire genomes in
relatively short time, has provided the opportunity to compare genetic material originating from one chromosome to
be compared to that of another without the risks associated with invasive sampling methods. However, the
limitations of the existing methods, which include insufficient sensitivity stemming from the limited levels of
cfDNA, and the sequencing bias of the technology stemming from the inherent nature of genomic information,
underlie the continuing need for noninvasive methods that would provide any or all of the specificity, sensitivity,
and applicability, to reliably diagnose fetal aneuploidies in a variety of clinical settings.

[0006] As nucleic acid sequencing has entered the clinical arena for cancer testing, organizations such as the
NCCLS (National Council Of Clinical Laboratory Services) and the Association of Clinical Cytogenetics have
provided guidelines for the standardization of existing sequencing-based tests that use PCR-based, dideoxy
terminator, and primer extension sequencing done on gel- or capillary-based sequencers (NCCLS: Nucleic Acid
Sequencing Methods in Diagnostic Laboratory Medicine MM9-A, Vol. 24 No. 40), Sanger sequencing and QF-PCR

Sequencing Analysis and Interpretation ratified by CMGS Executive Committee on 7th August, 2009 available at
web address cmgs.org/BPGs/pdfs%/20current%/o20bpgs/Sequencingv2.pdf QF-PCR for the diagnosis of aneuploidy
best practice guidelines (2007) v2.01). The guidelines are based on consensus testing of various protocols and inter
alia aim at reducing the occurrence of adverse events in the clinical laboratory e.g. sample mix ups, while
preserving the quality and reliability of the assays. As clinical laboratories are already experimenting with NIPD,
quality procedures for implementing the new sequencing technologies will be developed to provide appropriate, and
safe health care delivery systems.
[0007]    The present invention provides reliable next generation sequencing methods that are applicable at least to
the practice of noninvasive prenatal diagnostics, and encompasses procedures that increase the rapidity and quality
of the methods while minimizing loss of material, and reducing the likelihood of sample errors.

6.        DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
[0059]    The invention provides methods for determining the presence or absence of an aneuploidy e.g.
chromosomal or partial aneuploidy, and/or fetal fraction in maternal samples comprising fetal and maternal nucleic
acids by massively parallel sequencing. The method comprises a novel protocol for preparing sequencing libraries
that unexpectedly improves the quality of library DNA while expediting the process of analysis of samples for
prenatal diagnoses. The methods also allow for determining copy number variations (CNV) of any sequence of
interest in a test sample that comprises a mixture of nucleic acids that are known or are suspected to differ in the
amount of one or more sequence of interest, and/or determining the fraction of one of at least two populations of
nucleic acids contributed to the sample by different genomes. Sequences of interest include genomic sequences
ranging from hundreds of bases to tens of megabases to entire chromosomes that are known or are suspected to be
associated with a genetic or a disease condition. Examples of sequences of interest include chromosomes associated
with well known aneuploidies e.g. trisomy 21, and segments of chromosomes that are multiplied in diseases such as
cancer e.g. partial trisomy 8 in acute myeloid leukemia. The method comprises a statistical approach that accounts
                                                            -12-

for accrued variability stemming from process-related, interchromosomal, and inter-sequencing variability. The
method is applicable to determining CNV of any fetal aneuploidy, and CNVs known or suspected to be associated
with a variety of medical conditions.
[0060]     Unless otherwise indicated, the practice of the present invention involves conventional techniques
commonly used in molecular biology, microbiology, protein purification, protein engineering, protein and DNA
sequencing, and recombinant DNA fields, which are within the skill of the art. Such techniques are known to those
of skill in the art and are described in numerous standard texts and reference works. All patents, patent applications,
articles and publications mentioned herein are hereby expressly incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.
[0061]     Numeric ranges are inclusive of the numbers defining the range. It is intended that every maximum
numerical limitation given throughout this specification includes every lower numerical limitation, as if such lower
numerical limitations were expressly written herein. Every minimum numerical limitation given throughout this
specification will include every higher numerical limitation, as if such higher numerical limitations were expressly
written herein. Every numerical range given throughout this specification will include every narrower numerical
range that falls within such broader numerical range, as if such narrower numerical ranges were all expressly written
herein.
[0062]     The headings provided herein are not limitations of the various aspects or embodiments of the invention
which can be had by reference to the Specification as a whole. Accordingly, as indicated above, the terms defined
immediately below are more fully defined by reference to the specification as a whole.
[0063]     Unless defined otherwise herein, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as
commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs. Various scientific
dictionaries that include the terms included herein are well known and available to those in the art. Although any
methods and materials similar or equivalent to those described herein find use in the practice or testing of the
present invention, some preferred methods and materials are described. Accordingly, the terms defined immediately
below are more fully described by reference to the Specification as a whole. It is to be understood that this
invention is not limited to the particular methodology, protocols, and reagents described, as these may vary,
depending upon the context they are used by those of skill in the art.
6.1        DEFINITIONS
[0064]     As used herein, the singular terms "a", "an," and "the" include the plural reference unless the context
clearly indicates otherwise. Unless otherwise indicated, nucleic acids are written left to right in 5' to 3' orientation
and amino acid sequences are written left to right in amino to carboxy orientation, respectively.
[0065]     The term "assessing" herein refers to characterizing the status of a chromosomal aneuploidy by one of three
types of calls: "normal", "affected", and "no-call". For example, in the presence of trisomy the "normal" call is
determined by the value of a parameter e.g. a test chromosome dose that is below a user-defined threshold of
reliability, the "affected" call is determined by a parameter e.g. a test chromosome dose, that is above a user
defined threshold of reliability, and the "no-call" result is determined by a parameter e.g. a test chromosome dose,
that lies between the a user-defined thresholds of reliability for making a "normal" or an "affected" call.
[0066]     The term "copy number variation" herein refers to variation in the number of copies of a nucleic acid
sequence that is 1 kb or larger present in a test sample in comparison with the copy number of the nucleic acid
sequence present in a qualified sample. A "copy number variant" refers to the 1 kb or larger sequence of nucleic

part of a chromosome e.g. partial monosomy and partial trisomy, and encompasses imbalances resulting from
translocations, deletions and insertions.
[0070]     The term "plurality" is used herein in reference to a number of nucleic acid molecules or sequence tags that

one nucleic acid sequence whose copy number is suspected of having undergone variation. Nucleic acids present in
a test sample are referred to as "test nucleic acids".

numerical relationship between quantitative data sets. For example, a ratio (or function of a ratio) between the
number of sequence tags mapped to a chromosome and the length of the chromosome to which the tags are mapped,
is a parameter.
[0082]    The terms "threshold value" and "qualified threshold value" herein refer to any number that is calculated
using a qualifying data set and serves as a limit of diagnosis of a copy number variation e.g. an aneuploidy, in an
organism. If a threshold is exceeded by results obtained from practicing the invention, a subject can be diagnosed
with a copy number variation e.g. trisomy 21.
[0083]    The term "read" refers to a DNA sequence of sufficient length (e.g., at least about 30 bp) that can be used
to identify a larger sequence or region, e.g.that can be aligned and specifically assigned to a chromosome or
genomic region or gene.
[0084]    The term "sequence tag" is herein used interchangeably with the term "mapped sequence tag" to refer to a
sequence read that has been specifically assigned i.e. mapped, to a larger sequence e.g. a reference genome, by
alignment. Mapped sequence tags are uniquely mapped to a reference genome i.e. they are assigned to a single
location to the reference genome. Tags that can be mapped to more than one location on a reference genome i.e.
tags that do not map uniquely, are not included in the analysis.
[0085]    As used herein, the terms "aligned", "alignment", or "aligning" refer to one or more sequences that are
identified as a match in terms of the order of their nucleic acid molecules to a known sequence from a reference
genome. Such alignment can be done manually or by a computer algorithm, examples including the Efficient Local
Alignment of Nucleotide Data (ELAND) computer program distributed as part of the Illumina Genomics Analysis
                                                            -15-

pipeline. The matching of a sequence read in aligning can be a 100% sequence match or less than 100% (non
perfect match).
[0086]    As used herein, the term "reference genome" refers to any particular known genome sequence, whether
partial or complete, of any organism or virus which may be used to reference identified sequences from a subject.

suspected to be associated or implicated with a genetic or disease condition. Determining the absence or presence of
a clinically-relevant sequence can be useful in determining a diagnosis or confirming a diagnosis of a medical
condition, or providing a prognosis for the development of a disease.
[0089]    The term "derived" when used in the context of a nucleic acid or a mixture of nucleic acids, herein refers to
the means whereby the nucleic acid(s) are obtained from the source from which they originate. For example, in one

[00120] A "single nucleotide polymorphism" (SNP) occurs at a polymorphic site occupied by a single nucleotide,
which is the site of variation between allelic sequences. The site is usually preceded by and followed by highly
conserved sequences of the allele (e.g., sequences that vary in less than 1/100 or 1/1000 members of the

region) and is typically in the non-coding intron region. By examining several STR loci and counting how many
repeats of a specific STR sequence there are at a given locus, it is possible to create a unique genetic profile of an
individual.

6.2        DESCRIPTION
[00126] The invention provides methods for determining the presence or absence of an aneuploidy e.g.
chromosomal or partial aneuploidy, and/or fetal fraction in maternal samples comprising fetal and maternal nucleic
acids by massively parallel sequencing. The method comprises a novel protocol for preparing sequencing libraries
that unexpectedly improves the quality of library DNA while expediting the process of analysis of samples for
prenatal diagnoses. The methods allow for determining copy number variations (CNV) of any sequence of interest
in a test sample that comprises a mixture of nucleic acids that are known or are suspected to differ in the amount of
one or more sequence of interest, and/or determining the fraction of one of at least two populations of nucleic acids
contributed to the sample by different genomes.
Sequencing Methods
[00127] In one embodiment, the method described herein employs next generation sequencing technology (NGS) in
which clonally amplified DNA templates or single DNA molecules are sequenced in a massively parallel fashion
within a flow cell (e.g. as described in Volkerding et al. Clin Chem 55:641-658 [2009]; Metzker M Nature Rev
11:31-46 [2010]). In addition to high-throughput sequence information, NGS provides digital quantitative
information, in that each sequence read is a countable "sequence tag" representing an individual clonal DNA
template or a single DNA molecule. This quantification allows NGS to expand the digital PCR concept of counting
cell-free DNA molecules (Fan et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 105:16266-16271 [2008]; Chiu et al., Proc Natl
Acad Sci U S A 2008;105:20458-20463 [2008]). The sequencing technologies of NGS include pyrosequencing,
                                                           -19-

sequencing-by-synthesis with reversible dye terminators, sequencing by oligonucleotide probe ligation and real time
sequencing.
[00128] Some of the sequencing technologies are available commercially, such as the sequencing-by-hybridization
platform from Affymetrix Inc. (Sunnyvale, CA) and the sequencing-by-synthesis platforms from 454 Life Sciences
(Bradford, CT), Illumina/Solexa (Hayward, CA) and Helicos Biosciences (Cambridge, MA), and the sequencing-by
ligation platform from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA), as described below. In addition to the single
molecule sequencing performed using sequencing-by-synthesis of Helicos Biosciences, other single molecule
sequencing technologies are encompassed by the method of the invention and include the SMRTTM technology of
Pacific Biosciences, the Ion TorrentTm technology, and nanopore sequencing being developed for example, by
Oxford Nanopore Technologies.
[00129] While the automated Sanger method is considered as a 'first generation' technology, Sanger sequencing
including the automated Sanger sequencing, can also be employed by the method of the invention. Additional
sequencing methods that comprise the use of developing nucleic acid imaging technologies e.g. atomic force
microscopy (AFM) or transmission electron microscopy (TEM), are also encompassed by the method of the
invention. Exemplary sequencing technologies are described below.
[00130] In one embodiment, the DNA sequencing technology that is used in the method of the invention is the
Helicos True Single Molecule Sequencing (tSMS) (e.g. as described in Harris T.D. et al., Science 320:106-109
[2008]). In the tSMS technique, a DNA sample is cleaved into strands of approximately 100 to 200 nucleotides, and
a polyA sequence is added to the 3' end of each DNA strand. Each strand is labeled by the addition of a
fluorescently labeled adenosine nucleotide. The DNA strands are then hybridized to a flow cell, which contains
millions of oligo-T capture sites that are immobilized to the flow cell surface. The templates can be at a density of
about 100 million templates/cm 2 . The flow cell is then loaded into an instrument, e.g., HeliScopeTM sequencer, and
a laser illuminates the surface of the flow cell, revealing the position of each template. A CCD camera can map the
position of the templates on the flow cell surface. The template fluorescent label is then cleaved and washed away.
The sequencing reaction begins by introducing a DNA polymerase and a fluorescently labeled nucleotide. The
oligo-T nucleic acid serves as a primer. The polymerase incorporates the labeled nucleotides to the primer in a
template directed manner. The polymerase and unincorporated nucleotides are removed. The templates that have
directed incorporation of the fluorescently labeled nucleotide are discerned by imaging the flow cell surface. After
imaging, a cleavage step removes the fluorescent label, and the process is repeated with other fluorescently labeled
nucleotides until the desired read length is achieved. Sequence information is collected with each nucleotide
addition step.
[00131] In one embodiment, the DNA sequencing technology that is used in the method of the invention is the 454
sequencing (Roche) (e.g. as described in Margulies, M. et al. Nature 437:376-380 [2005]). 454 sequencing involves
two steps. In the first step, DNA is sheared into fragments of approximately 300-800 base pairs, and the fragments
are blunt-ended. Oligonucleotide adaptors are then ligated to the ends of the fragments. The adaptors serve as
primers for amplification and sequencing of the fragments. The fragments can be attached to DNA capture beads,
e.g., streptavidin-coated beads using, e.g., Adaptor B, which contains 5'-biotin tag. The fragments attached to the
beads are PCR amplified within droplets of an oil-water emulsion. The result is multiple copies of clonally
amplified DNA fragments on each bead. In the second step, the beads are captured in wells (pico-liter sized).
Pyrosequencing is performed on each DNA fragment in parallel. Addition of one or more nucleotides generates a
light signal that is recorded by a CCD camera in a sequencing instrument. The signal strength is proportional to the
                                                            -20-

number of nucleotides incorporated. Pyrosequencing makes use of pyrophosphate (PPi) which is released upon
nucleotide addition. PPi is converted to ATP by ATP sulfirylase in the presence of adenosine 5' phosphosulfate.
Luciferase uses ATP to convert luciferin to oxyluciferin, and this reaction generates light that is discerned and
analyzed.
[00132] In one embodiment, the DNA sequencing technology that is used in the method of the invention is the
SOLiDTM technology (Applied Biosystems). In SOLiDTM sequencing-by-ligation, genomic DNA is sheared into
fragments, and adaptors are attached to the 5' and 3' ends of the fragments to generate a fragment library.
Alternatively, internal adaptors can be introduced by ligating adaptors to the 5' and 3' ends of the fragments,
circularizing the fragments, digesting the circularized fragment to generate an internal adaptor, and attaching
adaptors to the 5' and 3' ends of the resulting fragments to generate a mate-paired library. Next, clonal bead
populations are prepared in microreactors containing beads, primers, template, and PCR components. Following
PCR, the templates are denatured and beads are enriched to separate the beads with extended templates. Templates
on the selected beads are subjected to a 3' modification that permits bonding to a glass slide. The sequence can be
determined by sequential hybridization and ligation of partially random oligonucleotides with a central determined
base (or pair of bases) that is identified by a specific fluorophore. After a color is recorded, the ligated
oligonucleotide is cleaved and removed and the process is then repeated.
[00133] In one embodiment, the DNA sequencing technology that is used in the method of the invention is the
single molecule, real-time (SMRTrM) sequencing technology of Pacific Biosciences. In SMRT sequencing, the
continuous incorporation of dye-labeled nucleotides is imaged during DNA synthesis. Single DNA polymerase
molecules are attached to the bottom surface of individual zero-mode wavelength identifiers (ZMW identifiers) that
obtain sequence information while phospolinked nucleotides are being incorporated into the growing primer strand.
A ZMW is a confinement structure which enables observation of incorporation of a single nucleotide by DNA
polymerase against the background of fluorescent nucleotides that rapidly diffuse in an out of the ZMW (in
microseconds). It takes several milliseconds to incorporate a nucleotide into a growing strand. During this time, the
fluorescent label is excited and produces a fluorescent signal, and the fluorescent tag is cleaved off. Identification of
the corresponding fluorescence of the dye indicates which base was incorporated. The process is repeated.
[00134] In one embodiment, the DNA sequencing technology that is used in the method of the invention is
nanopore sequencing (e.g. as described in Soni GV and Meller A. Clin Chem 53: 1996-2001 [2007]). Nanopore
sequencing DNA analysis techniques are being industrially developed by a number of companies, including Oxford
Nanopore Technologies (Oxford, United Kingdom). Nanopore sequencing is a single-molecule sequencing
technology whereby a single molecule of DNA is sequenced directly as it passes through a nanopore. A nanopore is
a small hole, of the order of 1 nanometer in diameter. Immersion of a nanopore in a conducting fluid and
application of a potential (voltage) across it results in a slight electrical current due to conduction of ions through the
nanopore. The amount of current which flows is sensitive to the size and shape of the nanopore. As a DNA
molecule passes through a nanopore, each nucleotide on the DNA molecule obstructs the nanopore to a different
degree, changing the magnitude of the current through the nanopore in different degrees. Thus, this change in the
current as the DNA molecule passes through the nanopore represents a reading of the DNA sequence.
[00135] In one embodiment, the DNA sequencing technology that is used in the method of the invention is the
chemical-sensitive field effect transistor (chemFET) array (e.g., as described in U.S. Patent Application Publication
No. 20090026082). In one example of the technique, DNA molecules can be placed into reaction chambers, and the
template molecules can be hybridized to a sequencing primer bound to a polymerase. Incorporation of one or more
                                                             -21-

triphosphates into a new nucleic acid strand at the 3' end of the sequencing primer can be discerned by a change in
current by a chemFET. An array can have multiple chemFET sensors. In another example, single nucleic acids can
be attached to beads, and the nucleic acids can be amplified on the bead, and the individual beads can be transferred
to individual reaction chambers on a chemFET array, with each chamber having a chemFET sensor, and the nucleic
acids can be sequenced.
[00136] In one embodiment, the DNA sequencing technology that is used in the method of the invention is the
Halcyon Molecular's method that uses transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The method, termed Individual
Molecule Placement Rapid Nano Transfer (IMPRNT), comprises utilizing single atom resolution transmission
electron microscope imaging of high-molecular weight (150kb or greater) DNA selectively labeled with heavy atom
markers and arranging these molecules on ultra-thin films in ultra-dense (3nm strand-to-strand) parallel arrays with
consistent base-to-base spacing. The electron microscope is used to image the molecules on the films to determine
the position of the heavy atom markers and to extract base sequence information from the DNA. The method is
further described in PCT patent publication WO 2009/046445. The method allows for sequencing complete human
genomes in less than ten minutes.
[00137] In one embodiment, the DNA sequencing technology is the Ion Torrent single molecule sequencing, which
pairs semiconductor technology with a simple sequencing chemistry to directly translate chemically encoded
information (A, C, G, T) into digital information (0, 1) on a semiconductor chip. In nature, when a nucleotide is
incorporated into a strand of DNA by a polymerase, a hydrogen ion is released as a byproduct. Ion Torrent uses a
high-density array of micro-machined wells to perform this biochemical process in a massively parallel way. Each
well holds a different DNA molecule. Beneath the wells is an ion-sensitive layer and beneath that an ion sensor.
When a nucleotide, for example a C, is added to a DNA template and is then incorporated into a strand of DNA, a
hydrogen ion will be released. The charge from that ion will change the pH of the solution, which can be identified
by Ion Torrent's ion sensor. The sequencer-essentially the world's smallest solid-state pH meter-calls the base,
going directly from chemical information to digital information. The Ion personal Genome Machine       (PGMTM)
sequencer then sequentially floods the chip with one nucleotide after another. If the next nucleotide that floods the
chip is not a match. No voltage change will be recorded and no base will be called. If there are two identical bases
on the DNA strand, the voltage will be double, and the chip will record two identical bases called. Direct
identification allows recordation of nucleotide incorporation in seconds.
[00138] Other sequencing methods include digital PCR and sequencing by hybridization. Digital polymerase chain
reaction (digital PCR or dPCR) can be used to directly identify and quantify nucleic acids in a sample. Digital PCR
can be performed in an emulsion. Individual nucleic acids are separated, e.g., in a microfluidic chamber device, and
each nucleic can is individually amplified by PCR. Nucleic acids can be separated such there is an average of
approximately 0.5 nucleic acids/well, or not more than one nucleic acid/well. Different probes can be used to
distinguish fetal alleles and maternal alleles. Alleles can be enumerated to determine copy number. In sequencing
by hybridization, the hybridization comprises contacting the plurality of polynucleotide sequences with a plurality of
polynucleotide probes, wherein each of the plurality of polynucleotide probes can be optionally tethered to a
substrate. The substrate might be flat surface comprising an array of known nucleotide sequences. The pattern of
hybridization to the array can be used to determine the polynucleotide sequences present in the sample. In other
embodiments, each probe is tethered to a bead, e.g., a magnetic bead or the like. Hybridization to the beads can be
identified and used to identify the plurality of polynucleotide sequences within the sample.
                                                           -22-

[00139] In one embodiment, the method employs massively parallel sequencing of millions of DNA fragments
using Illumina's sequencing-by-synthesis and reversible terminator-based sequencing chemistry (e.g. as described in
Bentley et al., Nature 6:53-59 [2009]). Template DNA can be genomic DNA e.g. cfDNA. In some embodiments,
genomic DNA from isolated cells is used as the template, and it is fragmented into lengths of several hundred base
pairs. In other embodiments, cfDNA is used as the template, and fragmentation is not required as cfDNA exists as
short fragments. For example fetal cfDNA circulates in the bloodstream as fragments of <300 bp, and maternal
cfDNA has been estimated to circulate as fragments of between about 0.5 and 1 Kb (Li et al., Clin Chem, 50: 1002
1011 [2004]). Illumina's sequencing technology relies on the attachment of fragmented genomic DNA to a planar,
optically transparent surface on which oligonucleotide anchors are bound. Template DNA is end-repaired to
generate 5'-phosphorylated blunt ends, and the polymerase activity of Klenow fragment is used to add a single A
base to the 3' end of the blunt phosphorylated DNA fragments. This addition prepares the DNA fragments for
ligation to oligonucleotide adapters, which have an overhang of a single T base at their 3' end to increase ligation
efficiency. The adapter oligonucleotides are complementary to the flow-cell anchors. Under limiting-dilution
conditions, adapter-modified, single-stranded template DNA is added to the flow cell and immobilized by
hybridization to the anchors. Attached DNA fragments are extended and bridge amplified to create an ultra-high
density sequencing flow cell with hundreds of millions of clusters, each containing -1,000 copies of the same
template. In one embodiment, the randomly fragmented genomic DNA e.g. cfDNA, is amplified using PCR before
it is subjected to cluster amplification. Alternatively, an amplification-free genomic library preparation is used, and
the randomly fragmented genomic DNA e.g. cfDNA is enriched using the cluster amplification alone (Kozarewa et
al., Nature Methods 6:291-295 [2009]). The templates are sequenced using a robust four-color DNA sequencing
by-synthesis technology that employs reversible terminators with removable fluorescent dyes. High-sensitivity
fluorescence identification is achieved using laser excitation and total internal reflection optics. Short sequence
reads of about 20-40 bp e.g. 36 bp, are aligned against a repeat-masked reference genome and genetic differences
are called using specially developed data analysis pipeline software. After completion of the first read, the
templates can be regenerated in situ to enable a second read from the opposite end of the fragments. Thus, either
single-end or paired end sequencing of the DNA fragments is used according to the method. Partial sequencing of
DNA fragments present in the sample is performed, and sequence tags comprising reads of predetermined length
e.g. 36 bp, that are mapped to a known reference genome are counted.
[00140] The length of the sequence read is associated with the particular sequencing technology. NGS methods
provide sequence reads that vary in size from tens to hundreds of base pairs. In some embodiments of the method
described herein, the sequence reads are about 20bp, about 25bp, about 30bp, about 35bp, about 40bp, about 45bp,
about 50bp, about 55bp, about 60bp, about 65bp, about 70bp, about 75bp, about 80bp, about 85bp, about 90bp,
about 95bp, about 100bp, about 110bp, about 120bp, about 130, about 140bp, about 150bp, about 200bp, about
250bp, about 300bp, about 350bp, about 400bp, about 450bp, or about 500bp. It is expected that technological
advances will enable single-end reads of greater than 500bp enabling for reads of greater than about 1000bp when
paired end reads are generated. In one embodiment, the sequence reads are 36bp. Other sequencing methods that
can be employed by the method of the invention include the single molecule sequencing methods that can sequence
nucleic acids molecules >5000 bp. The massive quantity of sequence output is transferred by an analysis pipeline
that transforms primary imaging output from the sequencer into strings of bases. A package of integrated algorithms
performs the core primary data transformation steps: image analysis, intensity scoring, base calling, and alignment.
                                                           -23-

[00141] In one embodiment, partial sequencing of DNA fragments present in the sample is performed, and
sequence tags comprising reads of predetermined length e.g. 36 bp, that map to a known reference genome are
counted. Only sequence reads that uniquely align to the reference genome are counted as sequence tags. In one
embodiment, the reference genome is the human reference genome NCBI3 6/hg 18 sequence, which is available on
the world wide web at genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgGateway?org=Human&db=hg18&hgsid=166260105).                  Other
sources of public sequence information include GenBank, dbEST, dbSTS, EMBL (the European Molecular Biology
Laboratory), and the DDBJ (the DNA Databank of Japan).        In another embodiment, the reference genome
comprises the human reference genome NCBI3 6/hg 18 sequence and an artificial target sequences genome, which
includes polymorphic target sequences e.g. a SNP genome comprising SEQ ID NOs:1-56. In yet another
embodiment, the reference genome is an artificial target sequence genome comprising polymorphic target sequences
e.g. SNP sequences of SEQ ID NOs: 1-56.
[00142] Mapping of the sequence tags is achieved by comparing the sequence of the tag with the sequence of the
reference genome to determine the chromosomal origin of the sequenced nucleic acid (e.g. cfDNA) molecule, and
specific genetic sequence information is not needed. A number of computer algorithms are available for aligning
sequences, including without limitation BLAST (Altschul et al., 1990), BLITZ (MPsrch) (Sturrock & Collins,
1993), FASTA (Person & Lipman, 1988), BOWTIE (Langmead et al., Genome Biology 10:R25.1-R25.10 [2009]),
or ELAND (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). In one embodiment, one end of the clonally expanded copies of
the plasma cfDNA molecules is sequenced and processed by bioinformatic alignment analysis for the Illumina
Genome Analyzer, which uses the Efficient Large-Scale Alignment of Nucleotide Databases (ELAND) software.
Analysis of sequencing information for the determination of aneuploidy may allow for a small degree of mismatch
(0-2 mismatches per sequence tag) to account for minor polymorphisms that may exist between the reference
genome and the genomes in the mixed sample. Analysis of sequencing information for the determination of fetal
fraction may allow for a small degree of mismatch depending on the polymorphic sequence. For example, a small
degree of mismatch may be allowed if the polymorphic sequence is an STR. In cases when the polymorphic
sequence is a SNP, all sequence that match exactly to either of the two alleles at the SNP site are counted first and
filtered from the remaining reads, for which a small degree of mismatch may be allowed.
Sequencing Library Preparation
[00143] Next-generation DNA sequencers, such as the 454-FLX (Roche; at web address 454.com), the SOLiDTM3
(Applied Biosystems; at web address solid.appliedbiosystems.com), and the Genome Analyzer (Illumina;
http://www.illumina.com/pages.ilmn?ID=204) have transformed the landscape of genetics through their ability to
produce hundreds of megabases of sequence information in a single run.
[00144] Sequencing methods require the preparation of sequencing libraries. Sequencing library preparation
involves the production of a random collection of adapter-modified DNA fragments, which are ready to be
sequenced. Sequencing libraries of polynucleotides can be prepared from DNA or RNA, including equivalents,
analogs of either DNA or cDNA, that is complementary or copy DNA produced from an RNA template, for
example by the action of reverse transcriptase. The polynucleotides may originate in double-stranded DNA
(dsDNA) form (e.g. genomic DNA fragments, PCR and amplification products) or polynucleotides that may have
originated in single-stranded form, as DNA or RNA, and been converted to dsDNA form. By way of example,
mRNA molecules may be copied into double-stranded cDNAs suitable for use in preparing a sequencing library.
The precise sequence of the primary polynucleotide molecules is generally not material to the method of library
preparation, and may be known or unknown. In one embodiment, the polynucleotide molecules are DNA
                                                         -24-

molecules. More particularly, the polynucleotide molecules represent the entire genetic complement of an
organism, and are genomic DNA molecules e.g. cfDNA molecules, which include both intron and exon sequence
(coding sequence), as well as non-coding regulatory sequences such as promoter and enhancer sequences. Still yet
more particularly, the primary polynucleotide molecules are human genomic DNA molecules e.g. cfDNA molecules
present in peripheral blood of a pregnant subject. Preparation of sequencing libraries for some NGS sequencing
platforms require that the polynucleotides be of a specific range of fragment sizes e.g. 0-1200bp. Therefore,
fragmentation of polynucleotides e.g. genomic DNA may be required. cfDNA exists as fragments of <300 base
pairs. Therefore, fragmentation of cfDNA is not necessary for generating a sequencing library using cfDNA
samples. Fragmentation of polynucleotide molecules by mechanical means e.g.nebulization, sonication and
hydroshear, results in fragments with a heterogeneous mix of blunt and 3'- and 5'-overhanging ends. Whether
polynucleotides are forcibly fragmented or naturally exists as fragments, they are converted to blunt-ended DNA
having 5-phosphates and 3'-hydroxyl.
[00145] Typically, the fragment ends are end-repaired i.e. blunt-ended using methods or kits known in the art. The
blunt-ended fragments can be phosphorylated by enzymatic treatment, for example using polynucleotide kinase. In
some embodiments, a single deoxynucleotide e.g. deoxyadenosine (A) is added to the 3'-ends of the
polynucleotides, for example, by the activity of certain types of DNA polymerase such as Taq polymerase or
Klenow exo minus polymerase. dA-tailed products are compatible with'T' overhang present on the 3' terminus of
each duplex region of adaptors to which they are ligated in a subsequent step. dA-tailing prevents self-ligation of
both of the blunt-ended polynucleotide such that there is a bias towards formation of the adaptor-ligated sequences.
The dA-tailed polynucleotides are ligated to double-stranded adaptor polynucleotides sequences. The same adaptor
can be used for both ends of the polynucleotide, or two sets of adaptors can be utilized. Ligation methods are
known in the art and utilize ligase enzymes such as DNA ligase to covalently link the adaptor to the d-A-tailed
polynucleotide. The adaptor may contain a 5'-phosphate moiety to facilitate ligation to the target 3-OH. The dA
tailed polynucleotide contains a 5'-phosphate moiety, either residual from the shearing process, or added using an
enzymatic treatment step, and has been end repaired, and optionally extended by an overhanging base or bases, to
give a 3-OH suitable for ligation. The products of the ligation reaction are purified to remove unligated adaptors,
adaptors that may have ligated to one another, and to select a size range of templates for cluster generation, which
can be preceded by an amplification e.g. a PCR amplification. Purification of the ligation products can be obtained
by methods including gel electrophoresis and solid-phase reversible immobilization (SPRI).
[00146] Standard protocols e.g. protocols for sequencing using, for example, the Illumina platform, instruct users to
purify the end-repaired products prior to dA-tailing, and to purify the dA-tailing products prior to the adaptor
ligating steps of the library preparation. Purification of the end-repaired products and dA-tailed products remove
enzymes, buffers, salts and the like to provide favorable reaction conditions for the subsequent enzymatic step. In
one embodiment, the steps of end-repairing, dA-tailing and adaptor ligating exclude the purification steps. Thus, in
one embodiment, the method of the invention encompasses preparing a sequencing library that comprises the
consecutive steps of end-repairing, dA-tailing and adaptor-ligating. In embodiments for preparing sequencing
libraries that do not require the dA-tailing step, e.g. protocols for sequencing using Roche 454 and
SOLIDTM3platforms, the steps of end-repairing and adaptor-ligating exclude the purification step of the end-repaired
products prior to the adaptor-ligating.
[00147] In a next step of one embodiment of the method, an amplification reaction is prepared. The amplification
step introduces to the adaptor ligated template molecules the oligonucleotide sequences required for hybridization to
                                                            -25-

the flow cell. The contents of an amplification reaction are known by one skilled in the art and include appropriate
substrates (such as dNTPs), enzymes (e.g. a DNA polymerase) and buffer components required for an amplification
reaction. Optionally, amplification of adaptor-ligated polynucleotides can be omitted. Generally amplification
reactions require at least two amplification primers i.e. primer oligonucleotides, which may be identical, and include
an 'adaptor-specific portion', capable of annealing to a primer-binding sequence in the polynucleotide molecule to
be amplified (or the complement thereof if the template is viewed as a single strand) during the annealing step.
Once formed, the library of templates prepared according to the methods described above can be used for solid
phase nucleic acid amplification. The term 'solid-phase amplification' as used herein refers to any nucleic acid
amplification reaction carried out on or in association with a solid support such that all or a portion of the amplified
products are immobilized on the solid support as they are formed. In particular, the term encompasses solid-phase
polymerase chain reaction (solid-phase PCR) and solid phase isothermal amplification which are reactions
analogous to standard solution phase amplification, except that one or both of the forward and reverse amplification
primers is/are immobilized on the solid support. Solid phase PCR covers systems such as emulsions, wherein one
primer is anchored to a bead and the other is in free solution, and colony formation in solid phase gel matrices
wherein one primer is anchored to the surface, and one is in free solution. Following amplification, and sequencing
libraries can be analyzed by microfluidic capillary electrophoresis to ensure that the library is free of adaptor dimers
or single stranded DNA. The library of template polynucleotide molecules is particularly suitable for use in solid
phase sequencing methods. In addition to providing templates for solid-phase sequencing and solid-phase PCR,
library templates provide templates for whole genome amplification.
[00148] In one embodiment, the library of adaptor-ligated polynucleotides is subjected to massively parallel
sequencing, which includes techniques for sequencing millions of fragments of nucleic acids, e.g., using attachment
of randomly fragmented genomic DNA to a planar, optically transparent surface and solid phase amplification to
create a high density sequencing flow cell with millions of clusters. Clustered arrays can be prepared using either a
process of thermocycling, as described in patent W09844151, or a process whereby the temperature is maintained
as a constant, and the cycles of extension and denaturing are performed using changes of reagents. The
Solexa/Illumina method referred to herein relies on the attachment of randomly fragmented genomic DNA to a
planar, optically transparent surface. Attached DNA fragments are extended and bridge amplified to create an ultra
high density sequencing flow cell with millions of clusters each containing thousands of copies of the same template
(WO 00/18957 and WO 98/4415 1). The cluster templates are sequenced using a robust four-color DNA
sequencing-by-synthesis technology that employs reversible terminators with removable fluorescent dyes.
Alternatively, the library may be amplified on beads wherein each bead contains a forward and reverse amplification
primer.
[00149] Sequencing of the amplified libraries can be carried out using any suitable sequencing technique as
described herein. In one embodiment, sequencing is massively parallel sequencing using sequencing-by-synthesis
with reversible dye terminators. In other embodiments, sequencing is massively parallel sequencing using
sequencing -by-ligation. In other embodiments, sequencing is single molecule sequencing.
Determination of Aneuploidy
[00150] The accuracy required for correctly determining whether an aneuploidy is present or absent in a sample, is
predicated in part on the variation of the number of sequence tags that map to the reference genome among samples
within a sequencing run (inter-chromosomal variability), and the variation of the number of sequence tags that map
to the reference genome in different sequencing runs (inter-sequencing variability). For example, the variations can
                                                           -26-

be particularly pronounced for tags that map to GC-rich or GC-poor reference sequences. In one embodiment, the
method uses sequencing information to calculate chromosome dose, which intrinsically account for the accrued
variability stemming from interchromosomal, inter-sequencing and platform-dependent variability. Chromosome
doses are determined from sequencing information i.e. the number of sequence tags, for the sequence of interest e.g.
chromosome 21, and the number of sequence tags for a normalizing sequence. Identification of a normalizing
sequence is performed in a set of qualified samples known not to contain an aneuploidy of the sequence of interest.
The flow chart provided in Figure 1 shows an embodiment of the method 100 whereby normalizing sequences e.g.
normalizing chromosomes, are identified, and the presence or absence of an aneuploidy is determined.
[00151] In step 110, a set of qualified maternal samples is obtained to identify qualified normalizing sequences e.g.
normalizing chromosomes, and to provide variance values for use in determining statistically meaningful
identification of an aneuploidy in test samples. In step 110, a plurality of biological qualified samples are obtained
from a plurality of subjects known to comprise cells having a normal copy number for any one sequence of interest
e.g. a chromosome of interest such as a chromosome associated with an aneuploidy. In one embodiment, the
qualified samples are obtained from mothers pregnant with a fetus that has been confirmed using cytogenetic means
to have a normal copy number of chromosomes relative to the chromosome of interest. The biological qualified
maternal samples may be biological fluid samples e.g. plasma samples, or any suitable sample as described above
that contains a mixture of fetal and maternal cfDNA molecules. The sample is a maternal sample that is obtained
from a pregnant female, for example a pregnant woman. Any maternal biological sample can be used a source of
fetal and maternal nucleic acids which are contained in cells or that are "cell-free". In some embodiments, it is
advantageous to obtain a maternal sample that comprises cell-free nucleic acids e.g. cfDNA. Preferably, the
maternal biological sample is a biological fluid sample. A biological fluid includes, as non-limiting examples, blood,
plasma, serum, sweat, tears, sputum, urine, sputum, ear flow, lymph, saliva, cerebrospinal fluid, ravages, bone
marrow suspension, vaginal flow, transcervical lavage, brain fluid, ascites, milk, secretions of the respiratory,
intestinal and genitourinary tracts, amniotic fluid and leukophoresis samples. In some embodiments, the biological
fluid sample is a sample that is easily obtainable by non-invasive procedures e.g. blood, plasma, serum, sweat, tears,
sputum, urine, sputum, ear flow, and saliva. In some embodiments, the biological sample is a peripheral blood
sample, or the plasma and/or the serum fractions thereof. In another embodiment, the sample is a mixture of two or
more biological samples e.g. a biological sample can comprise two or more of a biological fluid samples. As used
herein, the terms "blood," "plasma" and "serum" expressly encompass fractions or processed portions thereof. In
some embodiments, the biological sample is processed to obtain a sample fraction e.g. plasma, that contains the
mixture of fetal and maternal nucleic acids. In some embodiments, the mixture of fetal and maternal nucleic acids is
further processed from the sample fraction e.g. plasma, to obtain a sample comprising a purified mixture of fetal and
maternal nucleic acids e.g. cfDNA. Cell-free nucleic acids, including cell-free DNA, can be obtained by various
methods known in the art from biological samples including but not limited to plasma, serum and urine (Fan et al.,
Proc Natl Acad Sci 105:16266-16271 [2008]; Koide et al., Prenatal Diagnosis 25:604-607 [2005]; Chen et al.,
Nature Med. 2: 1033-1035 [1996]; Lo et al., Lancet 350: 485-487 [1997). To separate cfDNA from cells,
fractionation, centrifugation (e.g., density gradient centrifugation), DNA-specific precipitation, or high-throughput
cell sorting and/or separation methods can be used. Commercially available kits for manual and automated
separation of cfDNA are available (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN, Qiagen,Valencia, CA, Macherey-Nagel,
Duren, DE). In some instances, it can be advantageous to fragment the nucleic acid molecules in the nucleic acid
sample. Fragmentation can be random, or it can be specific, as achieved, for example, using restriction endonuclease
                                                            -27-

digestion. Methods for random fragmentation are well known in the art, and include, for example, limited DNAse
digestion, alkali treatment and physical shearing. In one embodiment, sample nucleic acids are obtained from as
cfDNA, which is not subjected to fragmentation. In other embodiments, the sample nucleic acids are obtained as
genomic DNA, which is subjected to fragmentation into fragments of approximately 500 or more base pairs, and to
which NGS methods can be readily applied. A sequencing library is prepared from naturally fragmented or forcibly
fragmented DNA. In one embodiment, preparation of the sequencing library comprises the consecutive steps of
end-repairing, dA-tailing and adaptor-ligating the DNA fragments. In another embodiment, preparation of the
sequencing library comprises the consecutive steps of end-repairing, and adaptor-ligating the DNA fragments.
[00152] In step 120, at least a portion of each of all the qualified nucleic acids contained in the qualified maternal
samples are sequenced. Prior to sequencing, the mixture of fetal and maternal nucleic acids e.g. purified cfDNA, is
modified to prepare a sequencing library to generate sequence reads of between 20 and 40bp e.g. 36bp, which are
aligned to a reference genome, e.g. hgl8. In some embodiments, the sequence reads comprise about 20bp, about
25bp, about 30bp, about 35bp, about 40bp, about 45bp, about 50bp, about 55bp, about 60bp, about 65bp, about
70bp, about 75bp, about 80bp, about 85bp, about90bp, about 95bp, about 100bp, about 11Obp, about 120bp, about
130, about 140bp, about 150bp, about 200bp, about 250bp, about 300bp, about 350bp, about 400bp, about 450bp, or
about 500bp. It is expected that technological advances will enable single-end reads of greater than 500bp enabling
for reads of greater than about 1000bp when paired end reads are generated. In one embodiment, the sequence reads
comprise 36bp. Sequence reads are aligned to a human reference genome, and the reads that are uniquely mapped
to the human reference genome are counted as sequence tags. In one embodiment, at least about 3 x 106 qualified
sequence tags, at least about 5 x 106 qualified sequence tags, at least about 8 x 106 qualified sequence tags, at least
about 10 x 106 qualified sequence tags, at least about 15 x 106 qualified sequence tags, at least about 20 x 106
qualified sequence tags, at least about 30 x 106 qualified sequence tags, at least about 40 x 106 qualified sequence
tags, or at least about 50 x 106 qualified sequence tags comprising between 20 and 40bp reads are obtained from
reads that map uniquely to a reference genome.
[00153] In step 130, all the tags obtained from sequencing the nucleic acids in the qualified maternal samples are
counted to determine a qualified sequence tag density. In one embodiment the sequence tag density is determined as
the number of qualified sequence tags mapped to the sequence of interest on the reference genome. In another
embodiment, the qualified sequence tag density is determined as the number of qualified sequence tags mapped to a
sequence of interest normalized to the length of the qualified sequence of interest to which they are mapped.
Sequence tag densities that are determined as a ratio of the tag density relative to the length of the sequence of
interest are herein referred to as tag density ratios. Normalization to the length of the sequence of interest is not
required, and may be included as a step to reduce the number of digits in a number to simplify it for human
interpretation. As all qualified sequence tags are mapped and counted in each of the qualified samples, the sequence
tag density for a sequence of interest e.g. chromosome of interest, in the qualified samples is determined, as are the
sequence tag densities for additional sequences from which normalizing sequences e.g. chromosomes, are identified
subsequently. In one embodiment, the sequence of interest is a chromosome that is associated with a chromosomal
aneuploidy e.g. chromosome 21, and the qualified normalizing sequence is a chromosome that is not associated with
a chromosomal aneuploidy and whose variation in sequence tag density best approximates that of chromosome 21.
For example, a qualified normalizing sequence is a sequence that has the smallest variability. In some
embodiments, the normalizing sequence is a sequence that best distinguishes one or more qualified, samples from
one or more affected samples i.e. the normalizing sequence is a sequence that has the greatest differentiability. The
                                                           -28-

level of differentiability can be determined as a statistical difference between the chromosome doses in a population
of qualified samples and the chromosome dose(s) in one or more test samples. In another embodiment, the sequence
of interest is a segment of a chromosome associated with a partial aneuploidy, e.g. a chromosomal deletion or
insertion, or unbalanced chromosomal translocation, and the normalizing sequence is a chromosomal segment that is
not associated with the partial aneuploidy and whose variation in sequence tag density best approximates that of the
chromosome segment associated with the partial aneuploidy.
[00154] In step 140, based on the calculated qualified tag densities, a qualified sequence dose for a sequence of
interest is determined as the ratio of the sequence tag density for the sequence of interest and the qualified sequence
tag density for additional sequences from which normalizing sequences are identified subsequently. In one
embodiment, doses for the chromosome of interest e.g. chromosome 21, is determined as a ratio of the sequence tag
density of chromosome 21 and the sequence tag density for each of all the remaining chromosomes i.e.
chromosomes 1-20, chromosome 22, chromosome X, and chromosome Y (see Examples 3-5, and Figures 9-15).
[00155] In step 145, a normalizing sequence e.g. a normalizing chromosome, is identified for a sequence of interest
e.g. chromosome 21, in a qualified sample based on the calculated sequence doses. The method identifies sequences
that inherently have similar characteristics and that are prone to similar variations among samples and sequencing
runs, and which are useful for determining sequence doses in test samples. In some embodiments, the normalizing
sequence is one that best differentiates an affected sample i.e. an aneuploid sample, from one or more qualified
samples. In other embodiments, a normalizing sequence is a sequence that displays a variability in the number of
sequence tags that are mapped to it among samples and sequencing runs that best approximates that of the sequence
of interest for which it is used as a normalizing parameter, and/or that can best differentiate an affected sample from
one or more unaffected samples.
[00156] In some embodiments, more than one normalizing sequence is identified. For example, the variation e.g.
coefficient of variation, in chromosome dose for chromosome of interest 21 is least when the sequence tag density
of chromosome 14 is used. In other embodiments, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight or more normalizing
sequences are identified for use in determining a sequence dose for a sequence of interest in a test sample.
[00157] In one embodiment, the normalizing sequence for chromosome 21 is selected from chromosome 9,
chromosome 1, chromosome 2, chromosome 3, chromosome 4, chromosome 5, chromosome 6, chromosome 7,
chromosome 8, chromosome 10, chromosome 11, chromosome 12, chromosome 13, chromosome 14, chromosome
15, chromosome 16, and chromosome 17. Preferably, the normalizing sequence for chromosome 21 is selected
from chromosome 9, chromosome 1, chromosome 2, chromosome 11, chromosome 12, and chromosome 14.
Alternatively, the normalizing sequence for chromosome 21 is a group of chromosomes selected from chromosome
9, chromosome 1, chromosome 2, chromosome 3, chromosome 4, chromosome 5, chromosome 6, chromosome 7,
chromosome 8, chromosome 10, chromosome 11, chromosome 12, chromosome 13, chromosome 14, chromosome
15, chromosome 16, and chromosome 17. In other embodiments, the normalizing sequence for chromosome 21 is a
group of chromosomes selected from chromosome 9, chromosome 1, chromosome 2, chromosome 11, chromosome
12, and chromosome 14.
[00158] In one embodiment, the normalizing sequence for chromosome 18 is selected chromosome 8, chromosome
2, chromosome 3, chromosome 4, chromosome 5, chromosome 6, chromosome 7, chromosome 9, chromosome 10,
chromosome 11, chromosome 12, chromosome 13, and chromosome 14. Preferably, the normalizing sequence for
chromosome 18 is selected chromosome 8, chromosome 2, chromosome 3, chromosome 5, chromosome 6,
chromosome 12, and chromosome 14. Alternatively, the normalizing sequence for chromosome 18 is a group of
                                                            -29-

chromosomes selected from chromosome 8, chromosome 2, chromosome 3, chromosome 4, chromosome 5,
chromosome 6, chromosome 7, chromosome 9, chromosome 10, chromosome 11, chromosome 12, chromosome 13,
and chromosome 14. In other embodiments, the normalizing sequence for chromosome 18 is a group of
chromosomes selected from chromosome 8, chromosome 2, chromosome 3, chromosome 5, chromosome 6,
chromosome 12, and chromosome 14.
[00159] In one embodiment, the normalizing sequence for chromosome X is selected from chromosome 1,
chromosome 2, chromosome 3, chromosome 4, chromosome 5, chromosome 6, chromosome 7, chromosome 8,
chromosome 9, chromosome 10, chromosome 11, chromosome 12, chromosome 13, chromosome 14, chromosome
15, and chromosome 16. Preferably, the normalizing sequence for chromosome X is selected from chromosome 2,
chromosome 3, chromosome 4, chromosome 5, chromosome 6, and chromosome 8. Alternatively, the normalizing
sequence for chromosome X is a group of chromosomes selected from chromosome 1, chromosome 2, chromosome
3, chromosome 4, chromosome 5, chromosome 6, chromosome 7, chromosome 8, chromosome 9, chromosome 10,
chromosome 11, chromosome 12, chromosome 13, chromosome 14, chromosome 15, and chromosome 16. In other
embodiments, the normalizing sequence for chromosome X is a group of chromosomes selected from chromosome
2, chromosome 3, chromosome 4, chromosome 5, chromosome 6, and chromosome 8.
[00160] In one embodiment, the normalizing sequence for chromosome 13 is a chromosome selected from
chromosome 2, chromosome 3, chromosome 4, chromosome 5, chromosome 6, chromosome 7, chromosome 8,
chromosome 9, chromosome 10, chromosome 11, chromosome 12, chromosome 14, chromosome 18, and
chromosome 21. Preferably, the normalizing sequence for chromosome 13 is selected from chromosome 2,
chromosome 3, chromosome 4, chromosome 5, chromosome 6, and chromosome 8. In another embodiment, the
normalizing sequence for chromosome 13 is a group of chromosomes selected from chromosome 2, chromosome 3,
chromosome 4, chromosome 5, chromosome 6, chromosome 7, chromosome 8, chromosome 9, chromosome 10,
chromosome 11, chromosome 12, chromosome 14, chromosome 18, and chromosome 21. In other embodiments,
the normalizing sequence for chromosome 13 is a group of chromosomes selected from chromosome 2,
chromosome 3, chromosome 4, chromosome 5, chromosome 6, and chromosome 8.
[00161] The variation in chromosome dose for chromosome Y is greater than 30 independently of which
normalizing chromosome is used in determining the chromosome Y dose. Therefore, any one chromosome, or a
group of two or more chromosomes selected from chromosomes 1-22 and chromosome X can be used as the
normalizing sequence for chromosome Y. In one embodiment, the at least one normalizing chromosome is a group
of chromosomes consisting of chromosomes 1-22, and chromosome X. In another embodiment, the at least one
normalizing chromosome is a group of chromosomes selected from chromosome 2, chromosome 3, chromosome 4,
chromosome ,5 and chromosome 6.
[00162] Based on the identification of the normalizing sequence(s) in qualified samples, a sequence dose is
determined for a sequence of interest in a test sample comprising a mixture of nucleic acids derived from genomes
hat differ in one or more sequences of interest.
[00163] In step 115, a test sample e.g. plasma sample, comprising fetal and maternal nucleic acids e.g. cfDNA, is
obtained from a pregnant subject e.g. a pregnant woman, for which the presence or absence of a fetal aneuploidy
needs to be determined.
[00164] A sequencing library is prepared as described for step 120, and in step 125, at least a portion of the test
nucleic acids in the test sample is sequenced to generate millions of sequence reads comprising between 20 and 500
bp e.g. 36bp. As in step 120, the reads generated from sequencing the nucleic acids in the test sample are uniquely
                                                          -30-

mapped to a human reference genome and are counted. As described in step 120, at least about 3 x 106 qualified
sequence tags, at least about 5 x 106 qualified sequence tags, at least about 8 x 106 qualified sequence tags, at least
about 10 x 106 qualified sequence tags, at least about 15 x 106 qualified sequence tags, at least about 20 x 106
qualified sequence tags, at least about 30 x 106 qualified sequence tags, at least about 40 x 106 qualified sequence
tags, or at least about 50 x 106 qualified sequence tags comprising between 20 and 40bp reads are obtained from
reads that map uniquely to the human reference genome.
[00165] In step 135, all the tags obtained from sequencing the nucleic acids in the test samples are counted to
determine a test sequence tag density. In one embodiment, the number of test sequence tags mapped to a sequence
of interest is normalized to the known length of a sequence of interest to which they are mapped to provide a test
sequence tag density. As described for the qualified samples, normalization to the known length of a sequence of
interest is not required, and may be included as a step to reduce the number of digits in a number to simplify it for
human interpretation. As all the mapped test sequence tags are counted in the test sample, the sequence tag density
for a sequence of interest e.g. a clinically-relevant sequence such as chromosome 21, in the test samples is
determined, as are the sequence tag densities for additional sequences that correspond to at least one normalizing
sequence identified in the qualified samples.
[00166] In step 150, based on the identity of at least one normalizing sequence in the qualified samples, a test
sequence dose is determined for a sequence of interest in the test sample. The sequence dose e.g. chromosome dose,
for a sequence of interest in a test sample is a ratio of the sequence tag density determined for the sequence of
interest in the test sample and the sequence tag density of at least one normalizing sequence determined in the test
sample, wherein the normalizing sequence in the test sample corresponds to the normalizing sequence identified in
the qualified samples for the particular sequence of interest. For example, if the normalizing sequence identified for
chromosome 21 in the qualified samples is determined to be chromosome 14, then the test sequence dose for
chromosome 21 (sequence of interest) is determined as the ratio of the sequence tag density for chromosome 21 in
and the sequence tag density for chromosome 14 each determined in the test sample. Similarly, chromosome doses
for chromosomes 13, 18, X, Y, and other chromosomes associated with chromosomal aneuploidies are determined.
As described previously, a sequence of interest can be part of a chromosome e.g. a chromosome segment.
Accordingly, the dose for a chromosome segment can be determined as the ratio of the sequence tag density
determined for the segment in the test sample and the sequence tag density for the normalizing chromosome
segment in the test sample, wherein the normalizing segment in the test sample corresponds to the normalizing
segment identified in the qualified samples for the particular segment of interest.
[00167] In step 155, threshold values are derived from standard deviation values established for a plurality of
qualified sequence doses. Accurate classification depends on the differences between probability distributions for
the different classes i.e. type of aneuploidy. Preferably, thresholds are chosen from empirical distribution for each
type of aneuploidy e.g. trisomy 21. Possible threshold values that were established for classifying trisomy 13,
trisomy 18, trisomy 21, and monosomy X aneuploidies as described in the Examples, which describe the use of the
method for determining chromosomal aneuploidies by sequencing cfDNA extracted from a maternal sample
comprising a mixture of fetal and maternal nucleic acids.
[00168] In step 160, the copy number variation of the sequence of interest e.g. chromosomal or partial aneuploidy,
is determined in the test sample by comparing the test sequence dose for the sequence of interest to at least one
threshold value established from the qualified sequence doses.
                                                             -31-

[00169] In step 160, the calculated dose for a test sequence of interest is compared to that set as the threshold values
that are chosen according to a user-defined threshold of reliability to classify the sample as a "normal" an "affected"
or a "no call" in step 165. The "no call" samples are samples for which a definitive diagnosis cannot be made with
reliability.
[00170] Another embodiment of the invention provides a method for providing prenatal diagnosis of a fetal
chromosomal aneuploidy in a biological sample comprising fetal and maternal nucleic acid molecules. The
diagnosis is made based on receiving the data from sequencing at least a portion of the mixture of the fetal and
maternal nucleic acid molecules derived from a biological test sample e.g. a maternal plasma sample, computing
from the sequencing data a normalizing chromosome dose for one or more chromosomes of interest, determining a
statistically significant difference between the normalizing chromosome dose for the chromosome of interest in the
test sample and a threshold value established in a plurality of qualified (normal) samples, and providing the prenatal
diagnosis based on the statistical difference. As described in step 165 of the method, a diagnosis of normal or
affected is made. A "no call" is provided in the event that the diagnosis for normal or affected cannot be made with
confidence.
Determination of CNV for prenatal diagnoses
[00171] Cell-free fetal DNA and RNA circulating in maternal blood can be used for the early non-invasive prenatal
diagnosis (NIPD) of an increasing number of genetic conditions, both for pregnancy management and to aid
reproductive decision-making. The presence of cell-free DNA circulating in the bloodstream has been known for
over 50 years. More recently, presence of small amounts of circulating fetal DNA was discovered in the maternal
bloodstream during pregnancy (Lo et al., Lancet 350:485-487 [1997]). Thought to originate from dying placental
cells, cell-free fetal DNA (cfDNA) has been shown to consists of short fragments typically fewer than 200 bp in
length Chan et al., Clin Chem 50:88-92 [2004]), which can be discerned as early as 4 weeks gestation (Illanes et
al., Early Human Dev 83:563-566 [2007]), and known to be cleared from the maternal circulation within hours of
delivery (Lo et al., Am J Hum Genet 64:218-224 [1999]). In addition to cfDNA, fragments of cell-free fetal RNA
(cfRNA) can also be discerned in the maternal bloodstream, originating from genes that are transcribed in the fetus
or placenta. The extraction and subsequent analysis of these fetal genetic elements from a maternal blood sample
offers novel opportunities for NIPD.
[00172] The present method is a polymorphism-independent method that for use in NIPD and that does not require
that the fetal cfDNA be distinguished from the maternal cfDNA to enable the determination of a fetal aneuploidy.
In some embodiments, the aneuploidy is a complete chromosomal trisomy or monosomy, or a partial trisomy or
monosomy. Partial aneuploidies are caused by loss or gain of part of a chromosome, and encompass chromosomal
imbalances resulting from unbalanced translocations, unbalanced inversions, deletions and insertions. By far, the
most common known aneuploidy compatible with life is trisomy 21 i.e. Down Syndrome (DS), which is caused by
the presence of part or all of chromosome 21. Rarely, DS can be cause by an inherited or sporadic defect whereby
an extra copy of all or part of chromosome 21 becomes attached to another chromosome (usually chromosome 14)
to form a single aberrant chromosome. DS is associated with intellectual impairment, severe learning difficulties
and excess mortality caused by long-term health problems such as heart disease. Other aneuploidies with known
clinical significance include Edward syndrome (trisomy 18) and Patau Syndrome (trisomy 13), which are frequently
fatal within the first few months of life. Abnormalities associated with the number of sex chromosomes are also
known and include monosomy X e.g. Turner syndrome (XO), and triple X syndrome (XXX) in female births and
Kleinefelter syndrome (XXY) and XYY syndrome in male births, which are all associated with various phenotypes
                                                          -32-

including sterility and reduction in intellectual skills. The method of the invention can be used to diagnose these and
other chromosomal abnormalities prenatally.
[00173] According to embodiments of the present invention the trisomy determined by the present invention is
selected from trisomy 21 (T21; Down Syndrome), trisomy 18 (T18; Edward's Syndrome), trisomy 16 (T16), trisomy
22 (T22; Cat Eye Syndrome), trisomy 15 (T15; Prader Willi Syndrome), trisomy 13 (T13; Patau Syndrome), trisomy
8 (T8; Warkany Syndrome) and the XXY (Kleinefelter Syndrome), XYY, or XXX trisomies. It will be appreciated
that various other trisomies and partial trisomies can be determined in fetal cfDNA according to the teachings of the
present invention. These include, but not limited to, partial trisomy 1q32-44, trisomy 9 p with trisomy, trisomy 4
mosaicism, trisomy 17p, partial trisomy 4q26-qter, trisomy 9, partial 2p trisomy, partial trisomy 1q, and/or partial
trisomy 6p/monosomy 6q.
[00174] The method of the present invention can be also used to determine chromosomal monosomy X, and partial
monosomies such as, monosomy 13, monosomy 15, monosomy 16, monosomy 21, and monosomy 22, which are
known to be involved in pregnancy miscarriage. Partial monosomy of chromosomes typically involved in complete
aneuploidy can also be determined by the method of the invention. Monosomy 18p is a rare chromosomal disorder
in which all or part of the short arm (p) of chromosome 18 is deleted (monosomic). The disorder is typically
characterized by short stature, variable degrees of mental retardation, speech delays, malformations of the skull and
facial (craniofacial) region, and/or additional physical abnormalities. Associated craniofacial defects may vary
greatly in range and severity from case to case. Conditions caused by changes in the structure or number of copies
of chromosome 15 include Angelman Syndrome and Prader-Willi Syndrome, which involve a loss of gene activity
in the same part of chromosome 15, the 15q 11-q13 region. It will be appreciated that several translocations and
microdeletions can be asymptomatic in the carrier parent, yet can cause a major genetic disease in the offspring. For
example, a healthy mother who carries the 15q11-q13 microdeletion can give birth to a child with Angelman
syndrome, a severe neurodegenerative disorder. Thus, the present invention can be used to identify such a deletion
in the fetus. Partial monosomy 13q is a rare chromosomal disorder that results when a piece of the long arm (q) of
chromosome 13 is missing (monosomic). Infants born with partial monosomy 13q may exhibit low birth weight,
malformations of the head and face (craniofacial region), skeletal abnormalities (especially of the hands and feet),
and other physical abnormalities. Mental retardation is characteristic of this condition. The mortality rate during
infancy is high among individuals born with this disorder. Almost all cases of partial monosomy 13q occur
randomly for no apparent reason (sporadic). 22q1 1.2 deletion syndrome, also known as DiGeorge syndrome, is a
syndrome caused by the deletion of a small piece of chromosome 22. The deletion (22 q1 1.2 ) occurs near the
middle of the chromosome on the long arm of one of the pair of chromosome. The features of this syndrome vary
widely, even among members of the same family, and affect many parts of the body. Characteristic signs and
symptoms may include birth defects such as congenital heart disease, defects in the palate, most commonly related
to neuromuscular problems with closure (velo-pharyngeal insufficiency), learning disabilities, mild differences in
facial features, and recurrent infections. Microdeletions in chromosomal region 22q1 1.2 are associated with a 20 to
30-fold increased risk of schizophrenia. In one embodiment, the method of the invention is used to determine partial
monosomies including but not limited to monosomy 18p, partial monosomy of chromosome 15 (15q 11-q13), partial
monosomy 13q, and partial monosomy of chromosome 22 can also be determined using the method. Example 6 and
Figure 16 illustrate the use of the method of the invention for determining that presence of a partial deletion of
chromosome 11.
                                                            -33-

[00175] The method of the invention can be also used to determine any aneuploidy if one of the parents is a known
carrier of such abnormality. These include, but not limited to, mosaic for a small supernumerary marker
chromosome (SMC); t( 11; 14)(p15;p13) translocation; unbalanced translocation t(8; 11)(p23.2;p15.5); 11 q23
microdeletion; Smith-Magenis syndrome 17p1 1.2 deletion; 22q13.3 deletion; Xp22.3 microdeletion; l0p14 deletion;
20p microdeletion, DiGeorge syndrome [del(22)(ql1.2q11.23)], Williams syndrome (7q11.23 and 7q36 deletions);
lp36 deletion; 2p microdeletion; neurofibromatosis type 1 (17q1 1.2 microdeletion), Yq deletion ; Wolf-Hirschhorn
syndrome (WHS, 4pl6.3 microdeletion); lp36.2 microdeletion; 11q14 deletion; 19ql3.2 microdeletion; Rubinstein
Taybi (16 p 13 . 3 microdeletion); 7p2l microdeletion; Miller-Dieker syndrome (17p13.3), 17p 11.2 deletion; and 2q37
microdeletion.
Determination of CNV of clinical disorders
[00176] In addition to the early determination of birth defects, the methods described herein can be applied to the
determination of any abnormality in the representation of genetic sequences within the genome. It has been shown
that blood plasma and serum DNA from cancer patients contains measurable quantities of tumor DNA, which can be
recovered and used as surrogate source of tumor DNA. Tumors are characterized by aneuploidy, or inappropriate
numbers of gene sequences or even entire chromosomes. The determination of a difference in the amount of a given
sequence i.e. a sequence of interest, in a sample from an individual can thus be used in the diagnosis of a medical
condition e.g. cancer.
[00177] Embodiments of the invention provide for a method to assess copy number variation of a sequence of
interest e.g. a clinically-relevant sequence, in a test sample that comprises a mixture of nucleic acids derived from
two different genomes, and which are known or are suspected to differ in the amount of one or more sequence of
interest. The mixture of nucleic acids is derived from two or more types of cells. In one embodiment, the mixture
of nucleic acids is derived from normal and cancerous cells derived from a subject suffering from a medical
condition e.g. cancer.
[00178] It is believed that many solid tumors, such as breast cancer, progress from initiation to metastasis through
the accumulation of several genetic aberrations. [Sato et al., Cancer Res., 50: 7184-7189 [1990]; Jongsma et al., J
Clin PAthol: Mol Path 55:305-309 [2002])]. Such genetic aberrations, as they accumulate, may confer proliferative
advantages, genetic instability and the attendant ability to evolve drug resistance rapidly, and enhanced
angiogenesis, proteolysis and metastasis. The genetic aberrations may affect either recessive "tumor suppressor
genes" or dominantly acting oncogenes. Deletions and recombination leading to loss of heterozygosity (LOH) are
believed to play a major role in tumor progression by uncovering mutated tumor suppressor alleles.
[00179] cfDNA has been found in the circulation of patients diagnosed with malignancies including but not limited
to lung cancer (Pathak et al. Clin Chem 52:1833-1842 [2006]), prostate cancer (Schwartzenbach et al. Clin Cancer
Res 15:1032-8 [2009]), and breast cancer (Schwartzenbach et al. available online at breast-cancer
research.com/content/1 1/5/R71 [2009]). Identification of genomic instabilities associated with cancers that can be
determined in the circulating cfDNA in cancer patients is a potential diagnostic and prognostic tool. In one
embodiment, the method of the invention assesses CNV of a sequence of interest in a sample comprising a mixture
of nucleic acids derived from a subject that is suspected or is known to have cancer e.g. carcinoma, sarcoma,
lymphoma, leukemia, germ cell tumors and blastoma. In one embodiment, the sample is a plasma sample derived
(processes) from peripheral blood and that comprises a mixture of cfDNA derived from normal and cancerous cells.
In another embodiment, the biological sample that is needed to determine whether a CNV is present is derived from
a mixture of cancerous and non-cancerous cells from other biological fluids including but not limited to serum,
                                                            -34-

sweat, tears, sputum, urine, sputum, ear flow, lymph, saliva, cerebrospinal fluid, ravages, bone marrow suspension,
vaginal flow, transcervical lavage, brain fluid, ascites, milk, secretions of the respiratory, intestinal and
genitourinary tracts, and leukophoresis samples, or in tissue biopsies, swabs or smears.
[00180] The sequence of interest is a nucleic acid sequence that is known or is suspected to play a role in the
development and/or progression of the cancer. Examples of a sequence of interest include nucleic acids sequences
that are amplified or deleted in cancerous cells as described in the following.
[00181] Dominantly acting genes associated with human solid tumors typically exert their effect by overexpression
or altered expression. Gene amplification is a common mechanism leading to upregulation of gene expression.
Evidence from cytogenetic studies indicates that significant amplification occurs in over 50% of human breast
cancers. Most notably, the amplification of the proto-oncogene human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)
located on chromosome 17 (17(17q21-q22)), results in overexpression of HER2 receptors on the cell surface
leading to excessive and dysregulated signaling in breast cancer and other malignancies (Park et al., Clinical Breast
Cancer 8:392-401 [2008]). A variety of oncogenes have been found to be amplified in other human malignancies.
Examples of the amplification of cellular oncogenes in human tumors include amplifications of: c-myc in
promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL60, and in small-cell lung carcinoma cell lines, N-myc in primary
neuroblastomas (stages III and IV), neuroblastoma cell lines, retinoblastoma cell line and primary tumors, and
small-cell lung carcinoma lines and tumors, L-myc in small-cell lung carcinoma cell lines and tumors, c-myb in
acute myeloid leukemia and in colon carcinoma cell lines, c-erbb in epidermoid carcinoma cell, and primary
gliomas, c-K-ras-2 in primary carcinomas of lung, colon, bladder, and rectum, N-ras in mammary carcinoma cell

ed.; Benjamin/Cummings Publishing Co. 1987)].
[00182] Chromosomal deletions involving tumor suppressor genes may play an important role in the development
and progression of solid tumors. The retinoblastoma tumor suppressor gene (Rb-1), located in chromosome 13q14,
is the most extensively characterized tumor suppressor gene. The Rb-1 gene product, a 105 kDa nuclear
phosphoprotein, apparently plays an important role in cell cycle regulation (Howe et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci (USA)
87:5883-5887 [1990]). Altered or lost expression of the Rb protein is caused by inactivation of both gene alleles
either through a point mutation or a chromosomal deletion. Rb-i gene alterations have been found to be present not
only in retinoblastomas but also in other malignancies such as osteosarcomas, small cell lung cancer (Rygaard et al.,
Cancer Res 50: 5312-5317 [1990)]) and breast cancer. Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) studies
have indicated that such tumor types have frequently lost heterozygosity at 13q suggesting that one of the Rb-1 gene
alleles has been lost due to a gross chromosomal deletion (Bowcock et al., Am J Hum Genet, 46: 12 [1990]).
Chromosome 1 abnormalities including duplications, deletions and unbalanced translocations involving
chromosome 6 and other partner chromosomes indicate that regions of chromosome 1, in particular 1q21 -1q32 and
ipi 1-13, might harbor oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes that are pathogenetically relevant to both chronic and
advanced phases of myeloproliferative neoplasms (Caramazza et al., Eur J Hematol84:191-200 [2010]).
Myeloproliferative neoplasms are also associated with deletions of chromosome 5. Complete loss or interstitial
deletions of chromosome 5 are the most common karyotypic abnormality in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs).
Isolated del(5q)/5q- MDS patients have a more favorable prognosis than those with additional karyotypic defects,
who tend to develop myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) and acute myeloid leukemia. The frequency of
unbalanced chromosome 5 deletions has led to the idea that 5q harbors one or more tumor-suppressor genes that
have fundamental roles in the growth control of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSCs/HPCs). Cytogenetic

mapping of commonly deleted regions (CDRs) centered on 5q31 and 5q32 identified candidate tumor-suppressor
genes, including the ribosomal subunit RPS 14, the transcription factor Egr 1/Krox20 and the cytoskeletal remodeling
protein, alpha-catenin (Eisenmann et al., Oncogene 28:3429-3441 [2009]). Cytogenetic and allelotyping studies of
fresh tumours and tumour cell lines have shown that allelic loss from several distinct regions on chromosome 3p,
including 3p25, 3p2l-22, 3p21.3, 3pl2-13 and 3pl4, are the earliest and most frequent genomic abnormalities
involved in a wide spectrum of major epithelial cancers of lung, breast, kidney, head and neck, ovary, cervix, colon,
pancreas, esophagous, bladder and other organs. Several tumor suppressor genes have been mapped to the
chromosome 3p region, and are thought that interstitial deletions or promoter hypermethylation precede the loss of
the 3p or the entire chromosome 3 in the development of carcinomas (Angeloni D., Briefings Functional Genomics
6:19-39 [2007]).
[00183] Newborns and children with Down syndrome (DS) often present with congenital transient leukemia and
have an increased risk of acute myeloid leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Chromosome 21, harboring
about 300 genes, may be involved in numerous structural aberrations, e.g., translocations, deletions, and
amplifications, in leukemias, lymphomas, and solid tumors. Moreover, genes located on chromosome 21 have been
identified that play an important role in tumorigenesis. Somatic numerical as well as structural chromosome 21
aberrations are associated with leukemias, and specific genes including RUNX1, TMPRSS2, and TFF, which are
located in 21q, play a role in tumorigenesis (Fonatsch C Gene Chromosomes Cancer 49:497-508 [2010]).
[00184] In one embodiment, the method provides a means to assess the association between gene amplification and
the extent of tumor evolution. Correlation between amplification and/or deletion and stage or grade of a cancer may
be prognostically important because such information may contribute to the definition of a genetically based tumor
grade that would better predict the future course of disease with more advanced tumors having the worst prognosis.
In addition, information about early amplification and/or deletion events may be useful in associating those events
as predictors of subsequent disease progression. Gene amplification and deletions as identified by the method can be
associated with other known parameters such as tumor grade, histology, Brd/Urd labeling index, hormonal status,
nodal involvement, tumor size, survival duration and other tumor properties available from epidemiological and
biostatistical studies. For example, tumor DNA to be tested by the method could include atypical hyperplasia,
ductal carcinoma in situ, stage I-III cancer and metastatic lymph nodes in order to permit the identification of
associations between amplifications and deletions and stage. The associations made may make possible effective
therapeutic intervention. For example, consistently amplified regions may contain an overexpressed gene, the
product of which may be able to be attacked therapeutically (for example, the growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase,
p185 HER2).
[00185] The method can be used to identify amplification and/or deletion events that are associated with drug
resistance by determining the copy number variation of nucleic acids from primary cancers to those of cells that
have metastasized to other sites. If gene amplification and/or deletion is a manifestation of karyotypic instability
that allows rapid development of drug resistance, more amplification and/or deletion in primary tumors from
chemoresistant patients than in tumors in chemosensitive patients would be expected. For example, if amplification
of specific genes is responsible for the development of drug resistance, regions surrounding those genes would be
expected to be amplified consistently in tumor cells from pleural effusions of chemoresistant patients but not in the
primary tumors. Discovery of associations between gene amplification and/or deletion and the development of drug
resistance may allow the identification of patients that will or will not benefit from adjuvant therapy.

Simultaenous Determination of Aneuploidy and Fetal Fraction
[00186] In another embodiment, the method enables the simultaneous determination of the fraction of the minor
fetal nucleic acid component i.e. fetal fraction, in a sample comprising a mixture of fetal and maternal nucleic acids.
In particular, the method enables the determination of the fraction of cfDNA contributed by a fetus to the mixture of
fetal and maternal cfDNA in a maternal sample e.g. a plasma sample. The difference between the maternal and fetal
fraction is determined by the relative contribution of a polymorphic allele derived from the fetal genome to the
contribution of the corresponding polymorphic allele derived from the maternal genome. Polymorphic sequences
can be used in conjunction with clinically-relevant diagnostic tests as a positive control for the presence of cfDNA
in order to highlight false-negative or false-positive results stemming from low levels of cfDNA below the
identification limit. The method described is useful across a range of gestational ages.
[00187] Exemplary embodiments of the method for simultaneously determining the fetal fraction and the presence
or absence of an aneuploidy are depicted in Figures 2-5 as follows.
[00188] Figure 2 provides a flow diagram of one embodiment of method of the invention 200 for simultaneously
determining a fetal aneuploidy and the fraction of fetal nucleic acids in a maternal biological sample. In step 210 a
test sample comprising a mixture of fetal and maternal nucleic acids is obtained from a subject. Test samples
include samples described in step 110 of the embodiment of the method 100. In some embodiments, the test sample
is a peripheral blood sample obtained from a pregnant female e.g. woman. In step 220 the mixture of nucleic acids
present in the sample is enriched for polymorphic target nucleic acids each comprising a polymorphic site. In some
embodiments, the nucleic acids that are enriched are cfDNA. Target nucleic acids are segments of genetic material
that are known to comprise at least one polymorphic site. In some embodiments, the target nucleic acids comprise a
SNP. In other embodiments, the target nucleic acid comprises an STR. In yet other embodiments, the target nucleic
acids comprise a tandem STR. Enrichment of a mixture of fetal and maternal nucleic acids comprises amplifying
target sequences from a portion of nucleic acids contained in the original maternal sample, and combining part or
the entire amplified product with the remainder of the original maternal sample. In step 230, at least a portion of the
enriched mixture is sequenced, sequence differences stemming from the polymorphic nature of the target sequences
are identified, and the relative contribution of polymorphic sequences derived from the fetal genome i.e. the fetal
fraction, is determined in step 240. In some embodiments, the original maternal test sample is a biological fluid
sample e.g. plasma. In other embodiments, the original maternal sample is a processed fraction of plasma
comprising purified fetal and maternal cfDNA.
Polymorphic sequences
[00189] Polymorphic sites that are contained in the target nucleic acids include without limitation single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs), tandem SNPs, small-scale multi-base deletions or insertions, called IN-DELS (also called
deletion insertion polymorphisms or DIPs), Multi-Nucleotide Polymorphisms (MNPs) and Short Tandem Repeats
(STRs). The polymorphic sites that are encompassed by the method of the invention are located on autosomal
chromosomes, thereby enabling the determination of fetal fraction independently of sex of the fetus. Any
polymorphic site that can be encompassed by the reads generated by the sequencing methods described herein can
be used to determine simultaneously the fetal fraction and the presence or absence of an aneuploidy in a maternal
sample.
[00190] In one embodiment, the mixture of fetal and maternal nucleic acids in the sample is enriched for target
nucleic acids that comprise at least one SNP. In some embodiments, each target nucleic acid comprises a single i.e.
one SNP. Target nucleic acid sequences comprising SNPs are available from publicly accessible databases
                                                            -37-

cfDNA are selected from the group of 92 individual identification SNPs (IISNPs) described by Pakstis el al.
(Pakstis et el. Hum Genet 127:315-324 [2010]), which have been shown to have a very small variation in frequency
across populations (Fa, <0.06), and to be highly informative around the world having an average heterozygosity >0.4.
SNPs that are encompassed by the method of the invention include linked and unlinked SNPs. Each target nucleic
acid comprises at least one polymorphic site e.g. a single SNP, that differs from that present on another target
nucleic acid to generate a panel of polymorphic sites e.g. SNPs, that contain a sufficient number of polymorphic
sites of which at least 1, at least 2, at least 3, at least 4, at least 5, at least 6, at least 7, at least 8, at least 9, at least 10,

least 25, at least 30, at least 35, at least 40 or more are informative. For example, a panel of SNPs can be configured
to comprise at least one informative SNP.
[00191] In one embodiment, the SNPs that are targeted for amplification are selected from rs560681, rsl 109037,
rs9866013, rs13182883, rs13218440, rs7041158, rs740598, rs10773760, rs 4530059, rs7205345, rs8078417,

[00192] In other embodiments, each target nucleic acid comprises two or more SNPs i.e. each target nucleic acid
comprises tandem SNPs. Preferably, each target nucleic acid comprises two tandem SNPs. The tandem SNPs are
analyzed as a single unit as short haplotypes, and are provided herein as sets of two SNPs. To identify suitable
tandem SNP sequences, the International HapMap Consortium database can be searched (The International
HapMap Project, Nature 426:789-796 [2003]). The database is available on the world wide web at hapmap.org. In

[00193] In another embodiment, the mixture of fetal and maternal nucleic acids in the sample is enriched for target
nucleic acids that comprise at least one STR. STR loci are found on almost every chromosome in the genome and
may be amplified using a variety of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers. Tetranucleotide repeats have been
preferred among forensic scientists due to their fidelity in PCR amplification, although some tri- and
                                                                 -38-

pentanucleotide repeats are also in use. A comprehensive listing of references, facts and sequence information on
STRs, published PCR primers, common multiplex systems, and related population data are compiled in STRBase,
which maybe accessed via the World Wide Web at ibm4.carb.nist.gov:8800/dna/home.htm. Sequence information
from GenBank* (http://www2.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/cgi-bin/genbank) for commonly used STR loci is also accessible
through STRBase. The polymorphic nature of tandem repeated DNA sequences that are widespread throughout the
human genome have made them important genetic markers for gene mapping studies, linkage analysis, and human
identity testing. Because of the high polymorphism of STRs, most individuals will be heterozygous i.e. most
people will possess two alleles (versions) of each-one inherited from each parent-with a different number of
repeats. Therefore, the non-maternally inherited fetal STR sequence will differ in the number of repeats from the
maternal sequence. Amplification of these STR sequences will result in two major amplification products
corresponding to the maternal alleles (and the maternally inherited fetal allele) and one minor product corresponding
to the non-maternally inherited fetal allele. This technique was first reported in 2000 (Pertl et al., Human Genetics
106:45-49 [2002]) and has subsequently been developed using simultaneous identification of multiple different STR
regions using real-time PCR (Liu et al., Acta Obset Gyn Scand 86:535-541 [2007]). Thus, the fraction of fetal
nucleic acid in a maternal sample can also be determined by sequencing polymorphic target nucleic acids
comprising STRs, which vary among individuals in the number of tandem repeated units between alleles. In one
embodiment, simultaneous determination of aneuploidy and fetal fraction comprises sequencing at least a portion of
fetal and maternal nucleic acids present in a maternal sample that has been enriched for polymorphic sequences
comprising STRs. Given that the size of fetal cfDNA is <300 bp, the polymorphic sequences comprise miniSTR,
which can be amplified to generate amplicons that are of lengths about the size of the circulating fetal DNA
fragments. The method can use one or a combination of any number of informative miniSTRs to determine the
fraction of fetal nucleic acid. For example, any one or a combination of any number of miniSTRs, for example the
miniSTRs disclosed in Table 22 can be used. In one embodiment, the fraction of fetal nucleic acid in a maternal
sample is performed using a method that includes determining the number of copies of the maternal and fetal nucleic
acid present in the maternal sample by amplifying at least one autosomal miniSTR chosen from CSF1PO, FGA,
TH01, TPOX, vWA, D3S1358,D5S818, D7S820, D8S1179, D13S317, D16S539, D18S51, D21S11, Penta D, Penta

D1S1677, D1S1627, and D1GATA113. In another embodiment, the at least one autosomal miniSTR is the group of
miniSTRs CSF1PO, FGA, D13S317, D16S539, D18S51, D2S1338, D21S11 and D7S82O.
[00194] Enrichment of the sample for the target nucleic acids is accomplished by methods that comprise
specifically amplifying target nucleic acid sequences that comprise the polymorphic site. Amplification of the target
sequences can be performed by any method that uses PCR or variations of the method including but not limited to
asymmetric PCR, helicase-dependent amplification, hot-start PCR, qPCR, solid phase PCR, and touchdown PCR.
Alternatively, replication of target nucleic acid sequences can be obtained by enzyme-independent methods e.g.
chemical solid-phase synthesis using the phosphoramidites. Amplification of the target sequences is accomplished
using primer pairs each capable of amplifying a target nucleic acid sequence comprising the polymorphic site e.g.
SNP, in a multiplex PCR reaction. Multiplex PCR reactions include combining at least 2, at least three, at least 3, at
least 5, at least 10, at least 15, at least 20, at least 25, at least 30 at least 30, at least 35, at least 40 or more sets of
primers in the same reaction to quantify the amplified target nucleic acids comprising at least two, at least three, at
                                                                 -39-

least 5, at least 10, at least 15, at least 20, at least 25, at least 30, at least 30, at least 35, at least 40 or more

one informative polymorphic sequence.
Amplification of polymorphic sequences
[00195] A number of nucleic acid primers are already available to amplify DNA fragments containing the SNP
polymorphisms and their sequences can be obtained, for example, from the above-identified databases. Additional
primers can also be designed, for example, using a method similar to that published by Vieux, E. F., Kwok, P-Y and
Miller, R. D. in BioTechniques (June 2002) Vol. 32. Supplement: "SNPs: Discovery of Marker Disease, pp. 28-32.

Exemplary sets of primers that are used to amplify the SNPs disclosed herein are provided in Example 7 and Tables
10 and 11, and are disclosed as SEQ ID NOs:57-112. In another embodiment, the group of 13 sets of primers SEQ

rs2837296-rs2837297; and rs2837381-rs4816672. The primers used for amplifying the target sequences comprising
the tandem SNPs are designed to encompass both SNP sites. Exemplary sets of primers used to amplify the tandem
SNPs disclosed herein are provided in Example 12 and disclosed as SEQ ID NOs:197-310.
[00197] Amplification of the target nucleic acids is performed using sequence-specific primers that allow for
sequence specific amplification. For example, the PCR primers are designed to discriminate against the
amplification of similar genes or paralogs that are on other chromosomes by taking advantage of sequence
                                                                 -40-

differences between the target nucleic acid and any paralogs from other chromosomes. The forward or reverse PCR
primers are designed to anneal close to the SNP site and to amplify a nucleic acid sequence of sufficient length to be
encompassed in the reads generated by massively parallel sequencing methods. Some massively parallel sequencing
methods require that nucleic acid sequence have a minimum length (bp) to enable bridging amplification that may
optionally be used prior to sequencing. Thus, the PCR primers used for amplifying target nucleic acids are designed
to amplify sequences that are of sufficient length to be bridge amplified and to identify SNPs that are encompassed
by the sequence reads. In some embodiments, the first of two primers in the primer set comprising the forward and
the reverse primer for amplifying the target nucleic acid is designed to identify a single SNP present within a
sequence read of about 20bp, about 25bp, about 30bp, about 35bp, about 40bp, about 45bp, about 50bp, about 55bp,
about 60bp, about 65bp, about 70bp, about 75bp, about 80bp, about 85bp, about90bp, about 95bp, about 100bp,
about 110bp, about 120bp, about 130, about 140bp, about 150bp, about 200bp, about 250bp, about 300bp, about
350bp, about 400bp, about 450bp, or about 500bp. It is expected that technological advances in massively parallel
sequencing technologies will enable single-end reads of greater than 500bp. In one embodiment, one of the PCR
primers is designed to amplify SNPs that are encompassed in sequence reads of 36 bp. The second primer is
designed to amplify the target nucleic acid as an amplicon of sufficient length to allow for bridge amplification. In
one embodiment, the exemplary PCR primers are designed to amplify target nucleic acids that contain a single SNP
selected from SNPs rs560681, rsl 109037, rs9866013, rs13182883, rs13218440, rs7041158, rs740598, rs10773760,

In other embodiments, the forward and reverse primers are each designed for amplifying target nucleic acids each
comprising a set of two tandem SNPs, each being present within a sequence read of about 20bp, about 25bp, about
30bp, about 35bp, about 40bp, about 45bp, about 50bp, about 55bp, about 60bp, about 65bp, about 70bp, about
75bp, about 80bp, about 85bp, about90bp, about 95bp, about 100bp, about 11Obp, about 120bp, about 130, about
140bp, about 150bp, about 200bp, about 250bp, about 300bp, about 350bp, about 400bp, about 450bp, or about
500bp. In one embodiment, at least one of the primers is designed to amplify the target nucleic acid comprising a
set of two tandem SNPs as an amplicon of sufficient length to allow for bridge amplification.
[00198] The SNPs, single or tandem SNPs, are contained in amplified target nucleic acid amplicons of at least
about 100bp, at least about 150bp, at least about 200bp, at least about250bp, at least about 300bp, at least about
350bp, or at least about 400bp. In one embodiment, target nucleic acids comprising a polymorphic site e.g. a SNP,
are amplified as amplicons of at least about 110 bp, and that comprise a SNP within 36 bp from the 3' or 5' end of
the amplicon. In another embodiment, target nucleic acids comprising two or more polymorphic sites e.g. two
tandem SNPs, are amplified as amplicons of at least about 110 bp, and that comprise the first SNP within 36 bp
from the 3' end of the amplicon, and/or the second SNP within 36 bp from the 5' end of the amplicon.
[00199] In one embodiment, at least 1, at least 2, at least 3, at least 4, at least 5, at least 6, at least 7, at least 8, at
least 9, at least 10, at least 11, at least 12, at least 13, at least 14, at least 15, at least 16, at least 17, at least 18, at
least 19, at least 20, at least 25, at least 30, at least 35, at least 40 or more sets of primers is chosen to amplify a
target nucleic acid comprising at least one informative tandem SNP in a portion of a mixture of fetal and maternal
cfDNA.
Amplification of STRs
[00200] A number of nucleic acid primers are already available to amplify DNA fragments containing the STRs and
their sequences can be obtained, for example, from the above-identified databases. Various sized PCR amplicons
                                                                 -41-

have been used to discern the respective size distributions of circulating fetal and maternal DNA species, and have
shown that the fetal DNA molecules in the plasma of pregnant women are generally shorter than maternal DNA
molecules (Chan et al., Clin Chem 50:8892 [2004]). Size fractionation of circulating fetal DNA has confirmed that
the average length of circulating fetal DNA fragments is <300 bp, while maternal DNA has been estimated to be
between about 0.5 and 1 Kb (Li et al., Clin Chem, 50: 1002-1011 [2004]). These findings are consistent with those
of Fan et al., who determined using NGS that fetal cfDNA is rarely >340bp (Fan et al., Clin Chem 56:1279-1286
[2010]). The method of the invention encompasses determining the fraction of fetal nucleic acid in a maternal
sample that has been enriched with target nucleic acids each comprising one miniSTR comprising quantifying at
least one fetal and one maternal allele at a polymorphic miniSTR, which can be amplified to generate amplicons that
are of lengths about the size of the circulating fetal DNA fragments.
[00201] In one embodiment, the method comprises determining the number of copies of at least one fetal and at
least one maternal allele at least at one polymorphic miniSTR that is amplified to generate amplicons that are less
than about 300 bp, less than about 250 bp, less than about 200 bp, less than about 150 bp, less than about 100 bp, or
less than about 50 bp. In another embodiment, the amplicons that are generated by amplifying the miniSTRs are
less than about 300 bp. In another embodiment, the amplicons that are generated by amplifying the miniSTRs are
less than about 250 bp. In another embodiment, the amplicons that are generated by amplifying the miniSTRs are
less than about 200 bp. Amplification of the informative allele includes using miniSTR primers, which allow for the
amplification of reduced-size amplicons to discern STR alleles that are less than about 500 bp, less than about 450
bp, less than about 400 bp, less than about 350 bp, less than about 300 base pairs (bp), less than about 250 bp, less
than about 200 bp, less than about 150 bp, less than about 100 bp, or less than about 50 bp. The reduced-size
amplicons generated using the miniSTR primers are known as miniSTRs that are identified according to the marker
name corresponding to the locus to which they have been mapped. In one embodiment, the miniSTR primers
include mini STR primers that have permitted the maximum size reduction in amplicon size for all 13 CODIS STR
loci in addition to the D2S1338, Penta D, and pentaE found in commercially available STR kits (Butler et al., J
Forensic Sci 48:1054-1064 [2003]), miniSTR loci that are unlinked to the CODIS markers as described by Coble
and Butler (Coble and Butler, J Forensic Sci 50:43-53 [2005]), and other minSTRs that have been characterized at
NIST. Information regarding the miniSTRs characterized at NIST is accessible via the world wide web at
cstl.nist.gov/biotech/strbase/newSTRs.htm. Any one pair or a combination of two or more pairs of miniSTR
primers can be used to amplify at least one miniSTR. For example, at least one set of primers is selected from the
primer sets provided in Table 22 (Example 11) and disclosed as SEQ ID NOs: 113-196 can be used to amplify
polymorphic target sequences comprising an STR.
[00202] Enrichment of the sample is obtained by amplifying target nucleic acids contained in a portion of the
mixture of fetal and maternal nucleic acids in the original sample, and combining at least a portion or all of the
amplified product with the remainder of the original unamplified sample. Enrichment comprises amplifying the
target nucleic acids that are contained in a portion of biological fluid sample. In one embodiment, the sample that is
enriched is the plasma fraction of a blood sample (See Figure 3). For example, a portion of an original maternal
plasma sample is used for amplifying target nucleic acid sequences. Subsequently, some or all of the amplified
product is combined with the remaining unamplified original plasma sample thereby enriching it (see Example 10).
In another embodiment, the sample that is enriched is the sample of purified cfDNA that is extracted from plasma
(See Figure 4). For example, enrichment comprises amplifying the target nucleic acids that are contained in a
portion of an original sample of purified mixture of fetal and maternal nucleic acids e.g. cfDNA that has been
                                                            -42-

purified from a maternal plasma sample, and subsequently combining some or all of the amplified product with the
remaining unamplified original purified sample (see Example 9). In yet another embodiment, the sample that is
enriched is a sequencing library sample prepared from a purified mixture of fetal and maternal nucleic acids (see
Figure 5). For example, enrichment comprises amplifying the target nucleic acids that are contained in a portion of
an original sample of purified mixture of fetal and maternal nucleic acids e.g. cfDNA that has been purified from a
maternal plasma sample, preparing a first sequencing library of unamplified nucleic acid sequences, preparing a
second sequencing library of amplified polymorphic target nucleic acids, and subsequently combining some or all of
the second sequencing library with some or all of the first sequencing library (see Example 8). The amount of
amplified product that is used to enrich the original sample is selected to obtain sufficient sequencing information
for determining both the presence or absence of aneuploidy and the fetal fraction from the same sequencing run. At
least about 3%, at least about 5%, at least about 7%, at least about 10%, at least about 15%, at least about 20%, at
least about 25%, at least about 30% or more of the total number of sequence tags obtained from sequencing are
mapped to determine the fetal fraction.
[00203] In one embodiment, the step of enriching the mixture of fetal and maternal nucleic acids for polymorphic
target nucleic acids comprises amplifying the target nucleic acids in a portion of a test sample e.g. a plasma test
sample, and combining all or a portion of the amplified product with the remaining plasma test sample. The
embodiment of the method 300 is depicted in flowchart provided in Figure 3. In step 310, a test sample e.g. a
biological fluid sample such as a blood sample, is obtained from a pregnant woman, and in step 320 a portion of the
cfDNA contained in the plasma fraction of the blood sample is used for amplifying target nucleic acids comprising
polymorphic sites e.g. SNPs. In one embodiment, at least about 1%, at least about 1.5%, at least about 2 % at least
about 10% of the maternal plasma was used to amplify the target nucleic acids. In step 330, a portion or all of the
amplified target nucleic acids is combined with the mixture of fetal and maternal cfDNA present in the maternal
sample, and the combined cfDNA and amplified nucleic acids are purified in step 340, and used for preparing a
library that was sequenced in step 350. The library was prepared from purified cfDNA and comprising at least
about 10%, at least about 15%, at least about 2 0%, at least about 2 5% , at least about 3 0% , at least about 35% , at
least about 40% , at least about 45%, or at least about 50% amplified product. In step 360, the data from the
sequencing runs is analyzed and the simultaneous determination of the fetal fraction and presence or absence of
aneuploidy is made.
[00204] In one embodiment, the step of enriching the mixture of fetal and maternal nucleic acids for polymorphic
target nucleic acids comprises a plurality of polymorphic target nucleic acids in a portion of a mixture of fetal and
maternal nucleic acids purified from a maternal test sample. In one embodiment, a portion of a mixture of fetal and
maternal nucleic acids e.g. cfDNA, purified from a maternal plasma sample is used for amplifying polymorphic
nucleic acid sequences, and a portion of the amplified product is combined with the unamplified mixture of purified
fetal and maternal nucleic acids e.g. cfDNA (see Figure 4). The embodiment of the method 400 is depicted in
flowchart provided in Figure 4. In step 410, a test sample e.g. a biological fluid sample such as a blood sample,
comprising a mixture of fetal and maternal nucleic acids is obtained from a pregnant woman, and the mixture of
fetal and maternal nucleic acids is purified from the plasma fraction in step 420. As described above, methods for
the separation of cell-free DNA from plasma are well-known. In step 430, a portion of the cfDNA contained in the
purified sample is used for amplifying target nucleic acids comprising polymorphic sites e.g. SNPs. At least about
5%, at least about 10%, at least about 15%, at least about 2 0% , at least about 2 5% , at least about 3 0% , at least
about 35% , at least about 40% , at least about 45%, or at least about 50% of purified cfDNA is used for amplifying
                                                           -43-

the target nucleic acids. Preferably, amplification of the target sequences can be performed by any method that uses
PCR or variations of the method including but not limited to asymmetric PCR, helicase-dependent amplification,
hot-start PCR, qPCR, solid phase PCR, and touchdown PCR. In step 440, a portion e.g. at least about 0.01% of the
amplified product is combined with the unamplified purified cfDNA sample, and the mixture of amplified and
unamplified fetal and maternal nucleic acids is sequenced in step 450. In one embodiment, sequencing is performed
using any one of the NGS technologies. In step 460, the data from the sequencing runs is analyzed and the
simultaneous determination of the fetal fraction and presence or absence of aneuploidy is made as described in step
140 of the embodiment depicted in Figure 1.
[00205] In another embodiment, the step 220 of enriching the mixture of fetal and maternal nucleic acids for
polymorphic target nucleic acids (Figure 2) comprises combining at least a portion of a first sequencing library of
unamplified fetal and maternal nucleic acid molecules with at least a portion of a second sequencing library of
amplified polymorphic target nucleic acids. Thus, the sample that is enriched is the library sample that is prepared
for sequencing (Figure 5). Enrichment of the library sample for the target nucleic acids is accomplished by
methods that comprise specifically amplifying the nucleic acid sequences that comprise the polymorphic site. In
step 510, a test sample e.g. a biological fluid sample such as a blood sample, comprising a mixture of fetal and
maternal nucleic acids is obtained from a pregnant woman, and the mixture of fetal and maternal nucleic acids is
purified from the plasma fraction in step 520. In step 530, a portion of the cfDNA contained in the purified sample
is used for amplifying target nucleic acids comprising polymorphic sites e.g. SNPs. At least about 5%, at least about
10%, at least about 15%, at least about 20%, at least about 25%, or at least about 30% of the purified cfDNA is used
for amplifying target nucleic acid sequences. Preferably, amplification of the target sequences can be performed by
any method that uses PCR or variations of the method including but not limited to asymmetric PCR, helicase
dependent amplification, hot-start PCR, qPCR, solid phase PCR, and touchdown PCR. In step 540, the amplified
target nucleic acids comprising the polymorphic sites e.g. SNPs, are used to prepare a target nucleic acid sequencing
library. Similarly, the portion of purified unamplified cfDNA is used to prepare a primary sequencing library in step
550. In step 560, a portion of the target library is combined with the primary library generated from the unamplified
mixture of nucleic acids, and the mixture of fetal and maternal nucleic acids comprised in the two libraries is
sequenced in step 570. The enriched library comprises at least about 5%, at least about 10%, at least about 15%, at
least about 20%, or at least about 25% of the target library. In step 580, the data from the sequencing runs is
analyzed and the simultaneous determination of the fetal fraction and presence or absence of aneuploidy is made as
described in step 140 of the embodiment depicted in Figure 1.
Determination of Aneuploidy from Sequencing Enriched Libraries
[00206] The presence or absence of aneuploidy is determined from sequencing the library enriched for polymorphic
target sequences as described for the unenriched library described in the method 100.
Determination of Fetal Fraction from Sequencing Enriched Libraries
[00207] The determination of the fetal fraction at steps 240 (Figure 2), 360 (Figure 3), 480 (Figure 4), and 580
(Figure 5) is based on the total number of tags that map to the first allele and the total number of tags that map to
second allele at an informative polymorphic site e.g. a SNP, contained in a reference genome. For example, the
reference genome is the human reference genome NCBI36/hg18 sequence, or the reference genome comprises the
human reference genome NCBI36/hg18 sequence and an artificial target sequences genome, which includes the
target polymorphic sequences. In one embodiment, the artificial target genome encompasses polymorphic
sequences that comprise SNPs rs560681, rsl 109037, rs9866013, rs13182883, rs13218440, rs7041158, rs740598,

rs530022. In one embodiment, the artificial genome includes the polymorphic target sequences of SEQ ID NOs:1
56. In another embodiment, the artificial genome includes the polymorphic target sequences of SEQ ID NOs:1-26
the (see Example 7). In another embodiment, the artificial target genome encompasses polymorphic sequences that
comprise STRs selected from CSF1PO, FGA, TH01, TPOX, vWA, D3S1358,D5S818, D7S820, D8S1179,
D13S317, D16S539, D18S51, D21S11, Penta D, Penta E, D2S1338, D1S1677, D2S441, D4S2364, D10S1248,

D4S2408, D4S2364, D3S4529, D3S3053, D2S1776, D2S441, D1S1677, D1S1627, and D1GATA113. In yet
another embodiment, the artificial target genome encompasses polymorphic sequences that comprise one or more
tandem SNPs (SEQ ID NOs: 1-56). The composition of the artificial target sequences genome will vary depending
on the polymorphic sequences that are used for determining the fetal fraction. Accordingly, an artificial target
sequences genome is not limited to the SNP or STR sequences exemplified herein.
[00208] The informative polymorphic site e.g. SNP, is identified by the difference in the allelic sequences and the
amount of each of the possible alleles. Fetal cfDNA is present at a concentration that is <10% of the maternal
cfDNA. Thus, the presence of a minor contribution of an allele to the mixture of fetal and maternal nucleic acids
relative to the major contribution of the maternal allele can be assigned to the fetus. Alleles that are derived from
the maternal genome are herein referred to as major alleles, and alleles that are derived from the fetal genome are
herein referred to as minor alleles. Alleles that are represented by similar levels of mapped sequence tags represent
maternal alleles. The results of an exemplary multiplex amplification of target nucleic acids comprising SNPs and
derived from a maternal plasma sample is shown in Figure 18. Informative SNPs are discerned from the single
nucleotide change at a predetermined polymorphic site, and fetal alleles are discerned by their relative minor
contribution to the mixture of fetal and maternal nucleic acids in the sample when compared to the major
contribution to the mixture by the maternal nucleic acids i.e. SNP sequences are informative when the mother is
heterozygous and a third paternal allele is present, permitting a quantitative comparison between the maternally
inherited allele and the paternally inherited allele to calculate the fetal fraction. Accordingly, the relative abundance
of fetal cfDNA in the maternal sample is determined as a parameter of the total number of unique sequence tags
mapped to the target nucleic acid sequence on a reference genome for each of the two alleles of the predetermined
polymorphic site. In one embodiment, the fraction of fetal nucleic acids in the mixture of fetal and maternal nucleic
acids is calculated for each of the informative allele (allelex) as follows:
       % fetal fraction allelex = ((EFetal sequence tags for allelex) / (EMaternal sequence tags for allelex)) x 100
and fetal fraction for the sample is calculated as the average of the fetal fraction of all of the informative alleles.
[00209] Optionally, the fraction of fetal nucleic acids in the mixture of fetal and maternal nucleic acids is calculated
for each of the informative allele (allelex) as follows:
    % fetal fraction allelex = ((2 X    EFetal sequence tags for allelex) / (EMaternal sequence tags for allelex)) x 100,
to compensate for the presence of 2 fetal alleles, one being masked by the maternal background.
[00210] The percent fetal fraction is calculated for at least 1, at least 2, at least 3, at least 4, at least 5, at least 6, at
least 7, at least 8, at least 9, at least 10, at least 11, at least 12, at least 13, at least 14, at least 15, at least 16, at least
17, at least 18, at least 19, at least 20, or more informative alleles. In one embodiment, the fetal fraction is the
average fetal fraction determined for at least 3 informative alleles.
                                                                 -45-

[00211] Similarly, fetal fraction can be calculated from the number of tags mapped to tandem SNP alleles as is done
for the single SNPs, but accounting for tags mapped to the two tandem SNP alles x and y present on each of the
amplified polymorphic target nucleic acid sequences that are amplified to enrich the samples i.e.
% fetal fraction allelexy = ((EFetal sequence tags for allelexy) / (EMaternal sequence tags for allelex,,)) x 100
[00212] Optionally, the fraction of fetal nucleic acids in the mixture of fetal and maternal nucleic acids is calculated
for each of the informative allele (allelexy) as follows:
% fetal fraction allelexy = ((2 X  EFetal sequence tags for allelexy) / (EMaternal sequence tags for allelex,,)) x 100,
[00213] to compensate for the presence of 2 sets of tandem fetal alleles, one being masked by the maternal
background. Tandem SNP sequences are informative when the mother is heterozygous and a third paternal
haplotype is present, permitting a quantitative comparison between the maternally inherited haplotype and the
paternally inherited haplotype to calculate the fetal fraction.
[00214] Fetal fraction can be determined from sequencing libraries comprising amplified polymorphic target
sequences comprising STRs by counting the number of tags mapped to a major (maternal) and a minor (fetal) allele.
The tags comprise sequences of sufficient length to encompass the STR alleles. Informative STR alleles can result
in one or two major tag sequences corresponding to the maternal alleles (and the maternally inherited fetal allele) and
one minor tag sequence corresponding to the non-maternally inherited fetal allele. The fetal fraction is calculated as
a ratio of the number of tags mapped to the fetal and maternal alleles.
Determination of fetal fraction by massively parallel sequencing
[00215] In addition to using the present method to simultaneously determine fetal fraction and aneuploidy, fetal
fraction can be determined independently of the determination of aneuploidy as described herein, but can be
determined independently and/or in conjunction with other methods used for the determination of aneuploidy such
as the methods described in U.S. Patent Application Publication Nos. US 2007/0202525A1; US2010/0112575A1,
US 2009/0087847A1; US2009/0029377A1; US 2008/0220422A1; US2008/0138809A1, US2008/0153090A1, and
US Patent 7,645,576. The method for determining fetal fraction can also be combined with assays for determining
other prenatal conditions associated with the mother and/or the fetus. For example, the method can be used in

US2010/0112590A1, US2009/0162842A1, US2007/0207466A1, and US2001/0051341A1, all of which are

[00216] Figure 6 shows provides a flow diagram of an embodiment of method of the invention for determining the
fraction of fetal nucleic acids in a maternal biological sample by massively parallel sequencing of PCR-amplified
polymorphic target nucleic acids independently of simultaneously determining aneuploidy. The method comprises
sequencing a polymorphic target nucleic acid sequencing library as follows. In step 610 a maternal sample
comprising a mixture of fetal and maternal nucleic acids is obtained from a subject. The sample is a maternal
sample that is obtained from a pregnant female, for example a pregnant woman. Other maternal samples can be
from mammals, for example, cow, horse, dog, or cat. If the subject is a human, the sample can be taken in the first
or second trimester of pregnancy. Examples of maternal biological sample are as described above. In step 620, the
mixture of fetal and maternal nucleic acids is further processed from the sample fraction e.g. plasma, to obtain a
sample comprising a purified mixture of fetal and maternal nucleic acids e.g. cfDNA, as described for embodiment
100. In step 630, a portion of the purified mixture of fetal and maternal cfDNA is used for amplifying a plurality of
polymorphic target nucleic acids each comprising a polymorphic site. Polymorphic sites that are contained in the
target nucleic acids include without limitation single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), tandem SNPs, small-scale
                                                            -46-

multi-base deletions or insertions, called IN-DELS (also called deletion insertion polymorphisms or DIPs), Multi
Nucleotide Polymorphisms (MNPs) Short Tandem Repeats (STRs), restriction fragment length polymorphism
(RFLP), or a polymorphism comprising any other change of sequence in a chromosome. Exemplary polymorphic
sequences and the methods for amplifying them are as disclosed for the embodiments shown in Figures 2-5. In
some embodiments, the polymorphic sites that are encompassed by the method of the invention are located on
autosomal chromosomes, thereby enabling the determination of fetal fraction independently of sex of the fetus.
Polymorphisms associated with chromosomes other than chromosome 13, 18, 21 and Y can also be used in the
methods described herein.
[00217] In step 640, a portion or all of the amplified polymorphic sequences are used to prepare a sequencing
library for sequencing in a parallel fashion as described. In one embodiment, the library is prepared for sequencing
by-synthesis using Illumina's reversible terminator-based sequencing chemistry, as described in Example 13. In
step 640, sequence information that is needed for determining fetal fraction is obtained using an NGS method. In
step 650, fetal fraction is determined based on the total number of tags that map to the first allele and the total
number of tags that map to second allele at an informative polymorphic site e.g. a SNP, contained in an artificial
reference genome e.g. a SNP reference genome. Artificial target genomes are as described herein. Informative
polymorphic sites are identified, and the fetal fraction is calculated as described.
[00218] Determination of fetal fraction according to the present can be used in conjunction with clinically-relevant
diagnostic tests as a positive control for the presence of cfDNA in order to highlight false-negative or false-positive
results stemming from low levels of cfDNA below the identification limit. In one embodiment, fetal fraction
information can be used to set thresholds and estimate minimum sample size in aneuploidy detection. Such use is
described in Example 16 below. Fetal fraction information can be used in conjunction with sequencing information.
For example, nucleic acids from a cell-free sample, for example a maternal plasma or serum sample, can be used to
enumerate sequences in a sample. Sequences can be enumerated using any of the sequencing techniques described
above. Knowledge of fetal fraction can be used to set "cutoff' thresholds to call "aneuploidy," "normal," or
"marginal/no call" (uncertain) states. Then, calculations can be performed to estimate the minimum number of
sequences required to achieve adequate sensitivity (i.e. probability of correctly identifying an aneuploidy state).
[00219] The present methods can be applied to determine the fraction of any one population of nucleic acids in a
mixture of nucleic acids contributed by different genomes. In addition to determining the fraction contributed to a
sample by two individuals e.g. the different genomes are contributed by the fetus and the mother carrying the fetus,
the methods can be used to determine the fraction of a genome in a mixture derived from two different cells of from
one individual e.g. the genomes are contributed to the sample by aneuploid cancerous cells and normal euploid cells
from the same subject.

Computer products
[00226] The determination of aneuploidy and/or the determination of fetal fraction is computationally derived from
the large amount of sequencing information that is obtained according to the methods described herein. In one
embodiment, the invention provides a computer-readable medium having stored thereon computer-readable
instructions for determining the presence or absence of aneuploidy from information obtained from sequencing fetal
and maternal nucleic acids in a maternal sample. In one embodiment, the computer-readable medium uses sequence
information obtained from a plurality of fetal and maternal nucleic acid molecules in a maternal plasma sample to
identify a number of mapped sequence tags for a chromosome of interest and for a normalizing chromosome. Using
the number of mapped sequence tags identified for a chromosome of interest and the number of mapped sequence
tags identified for the at least one normalizing chromosome, the computer-readable medium calculates a
chromosome dose for a chromosome of interest; and compares the chromosome dose to at least one threshold value,
and thereby identify the presence or absence of fetal aneuploidy. Examples of chromosomes of interest include
without limitation chromosomes 21, 13, 18 and X.
[00227] In another embodiment, the invention provides a computer processing system which is adapted or
configured to determine the presence or absence of aneuploidy from information obtained from sequencing fetal and
maternal nucleic acids in a maternal sample. The computer processing system is adapted or configured to (a) use
sequence information obtained from a plurality of fetal and maternal nucleic acid molecules in a maternal plasma
sample to identify a number of mapped sequence tags for a chromosome of interest; (b) use sequence information
obtained from a plurality of fetal and maternal nucleic acid molecules in a maternal plasma sample to identify a
number of mapped sequence tags for at least one normalizing chromosome; (c) use the number of mapped sequence
tags identified for a chromosome of interest in step (a) and the number of mapped sequence tags identified for the at
least one normalizing chromosome in step (b) to calculate a chromosome dose for a chromosome of interest; and (d)
compare the chromosome dose to at least one threshold value, and thereby identifying the presence or absence of
fetal aneuploidy. Examples of chromosomes of interest include without limitation chromosomes 21, 13, 18 and X.
[00228] In another embodiment, the invention provides Apparatus adapted or configured to determine the presence
or absence of aneuploidy from information obtained from sequencing fetal and maternal nucleic acids in a maternal
sample. The apparatus is adapted or configured to comprise (a) a sequencing device adapted or configured for
sequencing at least a portion of the nucleic acid molecules in a maternal plasma sample comprising fetal and

[00229] The present invention is described in further detail in the following Examples which are not in any way
intended to limit the scope of the invention as claimed. The attached Figures are meant to be considered as integral
parts of the specification and description of the invention. The following examples are offered to illustrate, but not to
limit the claimed invention.
                                                       Example 1
                                      Sample Processing and cfDNA Extraction
[00230] Peripheral blood samples were collected from pregnant women in their first or second trimester of
pregnancy and who were deemed at risk for fetal aneuploidy. Informed consent was obtained from each participant
prior to the blood draw. Blood was collected before amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling. Karyotype analysis
was performed using the chorionic villus or amniocentesis samples to confirm fetal karyotype.
[00231] Peripheral blood drawn from each subject was collected in ACD tubes. One tube of blood sample
(approximately 6-9 mL/tube) was transferred into one 15-mL low speed centrifuge tube. Blood was centrifuged at
2640 rpm, 40 C for 10 min using Beckman Allegra 6 R centrifuge and rotor model GA 3.8.
[00232] For cell-free plasma extraction, the upper plasma layer was transferred to a 15-ml high speed centrifuge
tube and centrifuged at 16000 x g, 4 0C for 10 min using Beckman Coulter Avanti J-E centrifuge, and JA-14 rotor.
The two centrifugation steps were performed within 72 h after blood collection. Cell-free plasma comprising
cfDNA was stored at -80 0 C and thawed only once before amplification of plasma cfDNA or for purification of
cfDNA.
[00233] Purified cell-free DNA (cfDNA) was extracted from cell-free plasma using the QJAamp Blood DNA Mini
kit (Qiagen) essentially according to the manufacturer's instruction. One milliliter of buffer AL and 100 pl of
Protease solution were added to 1 ml of plasma. The mixture was incubated for 15 minutes at 56 0 C. One milliliter
of 100% ethanol was added to the plasma digest. The resulting mixture was transferred to QJAamp mini columns
that were assembled with VacValves and VacConnectors provided in the QIAvac 24 Plus column assembly
(Qiagen). Vacuum was applied to the samples, and the cfDNA retained on the column filters was washed under
vacuum with 750pl of buffer AW1, followed by a second wash with 750pl of buffer AW24. The column was
centrifuged at 14,000 RPM for 5 minutes to remove any residual buffer from the filter. The cfDNA was eluted with
buffer AE by centrifugation at 14,000 RPM, and the concentration determined using QubitTM Quantitation Platform
(Invitrogen).

                    Preparation and sequencing of primary and enriched sequencing libraries
a.        Preparation of sequencing libraries - abbreviated protocol
[00234] All sequencing libraries i.e. primary and enriched libraries, were prepared from approximately 2 ng of
purified cfDNA that was extracted from maternal plasma. Library preparation was performed using reagents of the
NEBNextTM DNA Sample Prep DNA Reagent Set 1 (Part No. E6000L; New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA), for
Illumina@ as follows. Because cell-free plasma DNA is fragmented in nature, no further fragmentation by
nebulization or sonication was done on the plasma DNA samples. The overhangs of approximately 2 ng purified
cfDNA fragments contained in 40pl were converted into phosphorylated blunt ends according to the NEBNext@
                                                           -50-

End Repair Module by incubating in a 1.5ml microfuge tube the cfDNA with 5 pal 1 OX phosphorylation buffer, 2l
deoxynucleotide solution mix (10 mM each dNTP), 1 pl of a 1:5 dilution of DNA Polymerase I, 1 pl T4 DNA
Polymerase and 1 pl T4 Polynucleotide Kinase provided in the NEBNextTM DNA Sample Prep DNA Reagent Set 1
for 15 minutes at 20'C. The enzymes were then heat inactivated by incubating the reaction mixture at 750 C for 5
minutes. The mixture was cooled to 4 0 C, and dA tailing of the blunt-ended DNA was accomplished using 10pl of
                                                                                                TM
the dA-tailing master mix containing the Klenow fragment (3' to 5' exo minus) (NEBNext              DNA Sample Prep
DNA Reagent Set 1), and incubating for 15 minutes at 370 C. Subsequently, the Klenow fragment was heat
inactivated by incubating the reaction mixture at 750 C for 5 minutes. Following the inactivation of the Klenow
fragment, 1 pl of a 1:5 dilution of Illumina Genomic Adaptor Oligo Mix (Part No. 1000521; Illumina Inc., Hayward,
CA) was used to ligate the Illumina adaptors (Non-Index Y-Adaptors) to the dA-tailed DNA using 4pl of the T4
DNA ligase provided in the NEBNextTM DNA Sample Prep DNA Reagent Set 1, by incubating the reaction mixture
for 15 minutes at 25 0 C. The mixture was cooled to 40 C, and the adaptor-ligated cfDNA was purified from unligated
adaptors, adaptor dimers, and other reagents using magnetic beads provided in the Agencourt AMPure XP PCR
purification system (Part No. A63881; Beckman Coulter Genomics, Danvers, MA). Eighteen cycles of PCR were
performed to selectively enrich adaptor-ligated cfDNA (25pgl) using Phusion  High-Fidelity Master Mix (25pgl;
Finnzymes, Woburn, MA) and Illumina's PCR primers (0.5 ptM each) complementary to the adaptors (Part No.
1000537 and 1000537). The adaptor-ligated DNA was subjected to PCR (98 0 C for 30 seconds; 18 cycles of 98 0 C
for 10 seconds, 65 0 C for 30 seconds, and 72 0 C for 30; final extension at 72 0 C for 5 minutes, and hold at 40 C) using
Illumina Genomic PCR Primers (Part Nos. 100537 and 1000538) and the Phusion HF PCR Master Mix provided in
the NEBNextTM DNA Sample Prep DNA Reagent Set 1, according to the manufacturer's instructions. The
amplified product was purified using the Agencourt AMPure XP PCR purification system (Agencourt Bioscience
Corporation, Beverly, MA) according to the manufacturer's instructions available at
www.beckmangenomics.com/products/AMPureXPProtocol_000387v001.pdf.                    The purified amplified product was
eluted in 40pl of Qiagen EB Buffer, and the concentration and size distribution of the amplified libraries was
analyzed using the Agilent DNA 1000 Kit for the 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent technologies Inc., Santa Clara, CA).
b.        Preparation of sequencing libraries -full-length protocol
[00235] The full-length protocol described is essentially the standard protocol provided by Illumina, and only
differs from the Illumina protocol in the purification of the amplified library: the Illumina protocol instructs that the
amplified library be purified using gel electrophoresis, while the protocol described herein uses magnetic beads for
the same purification step. Approximately 2 ng of purified cfDNA that had been extracted from maternal plasma
was used to prepare a primary sequencing library using NEBNextTM DNA Sample Prep DNA Reagent Set 1 (Part
No. E6000L; New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) for Illumina@ essentially according to the manufacturer's
instructions. All steps except for the final purification of the adaptor-ligated products, which was performed using
Agencourt magnetic beads and reagents instead of the purification column, were performed according to the
protocol accompanying the NEBNextTM Reagents for Sample Preparation for a genomic DNA library that is
sequenced using the Illumina@ GAIL. The NEBNextTM protocol essentially follows that provided by Illumina,
which is available at grcf.jhml.edu/hts/protocols/1 1257047_ChIPSample Prep.pdf.

was cooled to 4 0 C, and purified using a QIAQuick column provided in the QIAQuick PCR Purification Kit
(QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, CA) as follows. The 50pl reaction was transferred to 1.5 ml microfuge tube, and 250gpl
of Qiagen Buffer PB were added. The resulting 300pl were transferred to a QlAquick column, which was
centrifuged at 13,000RPM for 1 minute in a microfuge. The column was washed with 750pl Qiagen Buffer PE, and
re-centrifuged. Residual ethanol was removed by an additional centrifugation for 5 minutes at 13,000 RPM. The
DNA was eluted in 39pl Qiagen Buffer EB by centrifugation. dA tailing of 34pl of the blunt-ended DNA was
accomplished using 16pl of the dA-tailing master mix containing the Klenow fragment (3' to 5' exo minus)
(NEBNext TM DNA Sample Prep DNA Reagent Set 1), and incubating for 30 minutes at 370 C according to the
manufacturer's NEBNext@ dA-Tailing Module. The sample was cooled to 4 0 C, and purified using a column
provided in the MinElute PCR Purification Kit (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, CA) as follows. The 50pl reaction was
transferred to 1.5 ml microfuge tube, and 250gpl of Qiagen Buffer PB were added. The 300gpl were transferred to the
MinElute column, which was centrifuged at 13,000RPM for 1 minute in a microfuge. The column was washed with
750pl Qiagen Buffer PE, and re-centrifuged. Residual ethanol was removed by an additional centrifugation for 5
minutes at 13,000 RPM. The DNA was eluted in 15pl Qiagen Buffer EB by centrifugation. Ten microliters of the
DNA eluate were incubated with 1 pl of a 1:5 dilution of the Illumina Genomic Adapter Oligo Mix (Part No.
1000521), 15 pl of 2X Quick Ligation Reaction Buffer, and 4 pl Quick T4 DNA Ligase, for 15 minutes at 25 0 C
according to the NEBNext@ Quick Ligation Module. The sample was cooled to 4 0 C, and purified using a
MinElute column as follows. One hundred and fifty microliters of Qiagen Buffer PE were added to the 30 pl

was centrifuged at 13,000RPM for 1 minute in a microfuge. The column was washed with 750pl Qiagen Buffer PE,
and re-centrifuged. Residual ethanol was removed by an additional centrifugation for 5 minutes at 13,000 RPM.
The DNA was eluted in 28pl Qiagen Buffer EB by centrifugation. Twenty three microliters of the adaptor-ligated
DNA eluate were subjected to 18 cycles of PCR (98 0 C for 30 seconds; 18 cycles of 98 0 C for 10 seconds, 65 0 C for
30 seconds, and 72 0 C for 30; final extension at 72 0 C for 5 minutes, and hold at 40 C) using Illumina Genomic PCR
Primers (Part Nos. 100537 and 1000538) and the Phusion HF PCR Master Mix provided in the NEBNextTM DNA
Sample Prep DNA Reagent Set 1, according to the manufacturer's instructions. The amplified product was purified
using the Agencourt AMPure XP PCR purification system (Agencourt Bioscience Corporation, Beverly, MA)
according to the manufacturer's instructions available at
www.beckmangenomics.com/products/AMPureXPProtocol_000387v001.pdf.                   The Agencourt AMPure XP PCR
purification system removes unincorporated dNTPs, primers, primer dimers, salts and other contaminates, and
recovers amplicons greater than 100bp. The purified amplified product was eluted from the Agencourt beads in
40gpl of Qiagen EB Buffer and the size distribution of the libraries was analyzed using the Agilent DNA 1000 Kit for
the 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent technologies Inc., Santa Clara, CA).
c.        Analysis of sequencing libraries prepared according to the abbreviated (a) and the full-length (b)
protocols
[00237] The elctropherograms generated by the Bioanalyzer are shown in Figure 7. Figure 7 (A) shows the
electropherogram of library DNA prepared from cfDNA purified from plasma sample M24228 using the full-length
protocol described in (a), and Figure 7 (B) shows the electropherogram of library DNA prepared from cfDNA
purified from plasma sample M24228 using the full-length protocol described in (b). In both figures, peaks 1 and 4
represent the 15 bp Lower Marker, and the 1,500 Upper Marker, respectively; the numbers above the peaks indicate
                                                             -52-

the migration times for the library fragments; and the horizontal lines indicate the set threshold for integration. The
electrophoregram in Figure 7 (A) shows a minor peak of fragments of 187bp and a major peak of fragments of 263
bp, while the electropherogram in Figure 7 (B) shows only one peak at 265 bp. Integration of the peak areas
resulted in a calculated concentration of 0.40 ng/pl for the DNA of the 187bp peak in Figure 7 (A), a concentration
of 7.34 ng/pl for the DNA of the 263bp peak in Figure 7 (A), and a concentration of 14.72 ng/pl for the DNA of the
265bp peak in Figure 7 (B). The Illumina adaptors that were ligated to the cfDNA are known to be 92bp, which
when subtracted from the 265bp, indicate that the peak size of the cfDNA is 173bp. It is possible that the minor
peak at 187bp represents fragments of two primers that were ligated end-to-end. The linear two-primer fragments
are eliminated from the final library product when the abbreviated protocol is used. The abbreviated protocol also
eliminates other smaller fragments of less than 187bp. In this example, the concentration of purified adaptor-ligated
cfDNA is double that of the adaptor-ligated cfDNA produced using the full-length protocol. It has been noted that
the concentration of the adaptor-ligated cfDNA fragments is always greater than that obtained using the full-length
protocol (data not shown).
[00238] Thus, an advantage of preparing the sequencing library using the abbreviated protocol is that the library
obtained consistently comprises only one major peak in the 262-267bp range while the quality of the library
prepared using the full-length protocol varies as reflected by the number and mobility of peaks other than that
representing the cfDNA. Non-cfDNA products would occupy space on the flow cell and diminish the quality of the
cluster amplification and subsequent imaging of the sequencing reactions, which underlies the overall assignment of
the aneuploidy status. The abbreviated protocol was shown not to affect the sequencing of the library (see Figure
8).
[00239] Another advantage of preparing the sequencing library using the abbreviated protocol is that the three
enzymatic steps of blunt-ending, d-A tailing, and adaptor-ligation, take less than an hour to complete to support the
validation and implementation of a rapid aneuploid diagnostic service.
[00240] Another advantage is that the three enzymatic steps of blunt-ending, d-A tailing, and adaptor ligation, are
performed in the same reaction tube, thus avoiding multiple sample transfers that would potentially lead to loss of
material, and more importantly to possible sample mix-up and sample contamination.
                                                       Example 3
                         Massively Parallel Sequencing and Determination of Aneuploidy
[00241] Peripheral blood samples were obtained from pregnant subjects and cfDNA was purified from the plasma
fraction as described in example 1. All sequencing libraries were prepared using the abbreviated library preparation
protocol described in Example 2. The amplified DNA was sequenced using Illumina's Genome Analyzer II to
obtain single-end reads of 36bp. Only about 30 bp of random sequence information are needed to identify a
sequence as belonging to a specific human chromosome. Longer sequences can uniquely identify more particular
targets. In the present case, a large number of 36 bp reads were obtained, covering approximately 10% of the
genome. Sequencing of library DNA was performed using the Genome Analyzer II (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA,
USA) according to standard manufacturer protocols. Copies of the protocol for whole genome sequencing using
Illumina/Solexa technology may be found at BioTechniques.RTM. Protocol Guide 2007 Published December 2006:
p 29, and on the world wide web at biotechniques.com/default.asp?
page=protocol&subsection=article display&id=1 12378. The DNA library was diluted to lnM and denatured.
Library DNA (5pM) was subjected to cluster amplification according to the procedure described in Illumina's
Cluster Station User Guide and Cluster Station Operations Guide, available on the world wide web at
                                                           -53-

illumina.com/systems/genome analyzer/clusterstation.ilmn. Upon completion of sequencing of the sample, the
Illumina "Sequencer Control Software" transferred image and base call files to a Unix server running the Illumina
"Genome Analyzer Pipeline" software version 1.51. The Illumina "Gerald" program was run to align sequences to
the reference human genome that is derived from the hg18 genome provided by National Center for Biotechnology
Information (NCBI36/hg18, available on the world wide web at http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi
bin/hgGateway?org=Human&db=hgl8&hgsid=166260105).              The sequence data generated from the above
procedure that uniquely aligned to the genome was read from Gerald output (export.txt files) by a program (c2c.pl)
running on a computer running the Linnux operating system. Sequence alignments with base mis-matches were
allowed and included in alignment counts only if they aligned uniquely to the genome. Sequence alignments with
identical start and end coordinates (duplicates) were excluded.
[00242] Between about 5 and 15 million 36 bp tags with 2 or less mismatches were mapped uniquely to the human
genome. All mapped tags were counted and included in the calculation of chromosome doses in both test and
qualifying samples. Regions extending from base 0 to base 2 x 106, base 10 x 106 to base 13 x 106, and base 23 x
106 to the end of chromosome Y, were specifically excluded from the analysis because tags derived from either
male or female fetuses map to these regions of the Y-chromosome.
[00243] It was noted that some variation in the total number of sequence tags mapped to individual chromosomes
across samples sequenced in the same run (inter-chromosomal variation), but substantially greater variation was
noted to occur among different sequencing runs (inter-sequencing run variation).
                                                      Example 4
                             Dose and variance for chromosomes 13, 18, 21, X, and Y
[00244] To examine the extent of inter-chromosomal and inter-sequencing variation in the number of mapped
sequence tags for all chromosomes, plasma cfDNA obtained from peripheral blood of 48 volunteer pregnant
subjects was extracted and sequenced as described in Example 1, and analyzed as follows.
[00245] The total number of sequence tags that were mapped to each chromosome (sequence tag density) was
determined. Alternatively, the number of mapped sequence tags may be normalized to the length of the
chromosome to generate a sequence tag density ratio. The normalization to chromosome length is not a required
step, and can be performed solely to reduce the number of digits in a number to simplify it for human interpretation.
Chromosome lengths that can be used to normalize the sequence tags counts can be the lengths provided on the
world wide web at genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/stats.html#hgl18.
[00246] The resulting sequence tag density for each chromosome was related to the sequence tag density of each of
the remaining chromosomes to derive a qualified chromosome dose, which was calculated as the ratio of the
sequence tag density for the chromosome of interest e.g. chromosome 21, and the sequence tag density of each of
the remaining chromosomes i.e. chromosomes 1-20, 22 and X. Table 1 provides an example of the calculated
qualified chromosome dose for chromosomes of interest 13, 18, 21, X, and Y, determined in one of the qualified
samples. Chromosomes doses were determined for all chromosomes in all samples, and the average doses for
chromosomes of interest 13, 18, 21, X and Y in the qualified samples are provided in Tables 2 and 3, and depicted in
Figures 9-13. Figures 9-13 also depict the chromosome doses for the test samples. The chromosome doses for each
of the chromosomes of interest in the qualified samples provides a measure of the variation in the total number of
mapped sequence tags for each chromosome of interest relative to that of each of the remaining chromosomes.
Thus, qualified chromosome doses can identify the chromosome or a group of chromosomes i.e. normalizing
chromosome, that has a variation among samples that is closest to the variation of the chromosome of interest, and
                                                          -54-

that would serve as ideal sequences for normalizing values for further statistical evaluation. Figures 14 and 15
depict the calculated average chromosome doses determined in a population of qualified samples for chromosomes
13, 18, and 21, and chromosomes X and Y.
[00247] In some instances, the best normalizing chromosome may not have the least variation, but may have a
distribution of qualified doses that best distinguishes a test sample or samples from the qualified samples i.e. the best
normalizing chromosome may not have the lowest variation, but may have the greatest differentiability. Thus,
differentiability accounts for the variation in chromosome dose and the distribution of the doses in the qualified
samples.
[00248] Tables 2 and 3 provide the coefficient of variation as the measure of variability, and student t-test values as
a measure of differentiability for chromosomes 18, 21, X and Y, wherein the smaller the T-test value, the greatest
the differentiability. The differentiability for chromosome 13 was determined as the ratio of difference between the
mean chromosome dose in the qualified samples and the dose for chromosome 13 in the only T13 test sample, and
the standard deviation of mean of the qualified dose.
[00249] The qualified chromosome doses also serve as the basis for determining threshold values when identifying
aneuploidies in test samples as described in the following.

chromosomes, chromosome doses and differentiability for each of the chromosomes of interest are described in
Example 3.

                          Diagnosis of Fetal Aneuploidy Using Normalizing Chromosomes
[00251] To apply the use of chromosome doses for assessing aneuploidy in a biological test sample, maternal blood
test samples were obtained from pregnant volunteers and cfDNA was prepared, and a sequencing library prepared
according to the abbreviated protocol described in Example 2 was sequenced and analyzed.
Trisomy 21
[00252] Table 4 provides the calculated dose for chromosome 21 in an exemplary test sample (#11403). The
calculated threshold for the positive diagnosis of T21 aneuploidy was set at > 2 standard deviations from the mean
of the qualified (normal) samples. A diagnosis for T21 was given based on the chromosome dose in the test sample
being greater than the set threshold. Chromosomes 14 and 15 were used as normalizing chromosomes in separate
calculations to show that either a chromosome having the lowest variability e.g. chromosome 14, or a chromosome
having the greatest differentiability e.g. chromosome 15, can be used to identify the aneuploidy. Thirteen T21
samples were identified using the calculated chromosome doses, and the aneuploidy samples were confirmed to be
T21 by karyotype.

[00253] Table 5 provides the calculated dose for chromosome 18 in a test sample (#11390). The calculated
threshold for the positive diagnosis of T18 aneuploidy was set at 2 standard deviations from the mean of the
qualified (normal) samples. A diagnosis for T1 8 was given based on the chromosome dose in the test sample being
greater than the set threshold. Chromosome 8 was used as the normalizing chromosome. In this instance
chromosome 8 had the lowest variability and the greatest differentiability. Eight T1 8 samples were identified using
chromosome doses, and were confirmed to be T18 by karyotype.
[00254] These data show that a normalizing chromosome can have both the lowest variability and the greatest
differentiability.

[00256] The sequence tag density for chromosomes 3-6 is the average tag counts for chromosomes 3-6.
[00257] The data show that the combination of chromosomes 3, 4, 5 and 6 provide a variability that is lower than
that of chromosome 5, and the greatest differentiability than any of the other chromosomes.
[00258] Thus, a group of chromosomes can be used as the normalizing chromosome to determine chromosome
doses and identify aneuploidies.
Turner Syndrome (monosomy X)
[00259] Table 7 provides the calculated dose for chromosomes X and Y in a test sample (#51238). The calculated

standard deviations from the mean, and for the absence of the Y chromosome at < -2 standard deviations from the
mean for qualified (normal) samples.

[00260] A sample having an X chromosome dose less than that of the set threshold was identified as having less
than one X chromosome. The same sample was determined to have a Y chromosome dose that was less than the set
threshold, indicating that the sample did not have a Y chromosome. Thus, the combination of chromosome doses
for X and Y were used to identify the Turner Syndrome (monosomy X) samples.
[00261] Thus, the method provided enables for the determination of CNV of chromosomes. In particular, the
method enables for the determination of over- and under-representation chromosomal aneuploidies by massively
parallel sequencing of maternal plasma cfDNA and identification of normalizing chromosomes for the statistical
analysis of the sequencing data. The sensitivity and reliability of the method allow for accurate first and second
trimester aneuploidy testing.

                                        Determination of partial aneuploidy
[00262] The use of sequence doses was applied for assessing partial aneuploidy in a biological test sample of
cfDNA that was prepared from blood plasma, and sequenced as described in Example 1. The sample was confirmed
by karyotyping to have been derived from a subject with a partial deletion of chromosome 11.
[00263] Analysis of the sequencing data for the partial aneuploidy (partial deletion of chromosome 11 i.e. q21-q23)
was performed as described for the chromosomal aneuploidies in the previous examples. Mapping of the sequence
tags to chromosome 11 in a test sample revealed a noticeable loss of tag counts between base pairs 81000082
103000103 in the q arm of the chromosome relative to the tag counts obtained for corresponding sequence on
chromosome 11 in the qualified samples (data not shown). Sequence tags mapped to the sequence of interest on
chromosome 11 (810000082-103000103bp) in each of the qualified samples, and sequence tags mapped to all 20
megabase segments in the entire genome in the qualified samples i.e. qualified sequence tag densities, were used to
determine qualified sequence doses as ratios of tag densities in all qualified samples. The average sequence dose,
standard deviation, and coefficient of variation were calculated for all 20 megabase segments in the entire genome,
and the 20-megabase sequence having the least variability was the identified normalizing sequence on chromosome
5 (13000014-33000033bp) (See Table 8), which was used to calculate the dose for the sequence of interest in the
test sample (see Table 9). Table 8 provides the sequence dose for the sequence of interest on chromosome 11
(810000082-103000103bp) in the test sample that was calculated as the ratio of sequence tags mapped to the
sequence of interest and the sequence tags mapped to the identified normalizing sequence. Figure 16 shows the
sequence doses for the sequence of interest in the 7 qualified samples (0) and the sequence dose for the
                                                          -60-

corresponding sequence in the test sample (0). The mean is shown by the solid line, and the calculated threshold for
the positive diagnosis of partial aneuploidy that was set 5 standard deviations from the mean is shown by the dashed
line. A diagnosis for partial aneuploidy was based on the sequence dose in the test sample being less than the set
threshold. The test sample was verified by karyotyping to have deletion q2 1-q23 on chromosome 11.
[00264] Therefore, in addition to identifying chromosomal aneuploidies, the method of the invention can be used to
identify partial aneuploidies.

       Simultaneous Determination of Aneuploidy and Fetal Fraction by Massively Parallel Sequencing:
                       Selection of Autosomal SNPs for the Determination of Fetal Fraction
[00265] A set of 28 autosomal SNPs were selected from a list of 92 SNPs (Pakstis et al., Hum Genet 127:315-324
[2010]), and from SNP sequences available at Applied Biosystems at world wide web address
appliedbiosystems.com, and validated for use in multiplexed PCR amplification and for massively parallel
sequencing to determine fetal fraction with or without simultaneously determining the presence or absence of
aneuploidy. Primers were designed to hybridize to a sequence close to the SNPs site on the cfDNA to ensure that it
be included in the 36 bp read generated from the massively parallel sequencing on the Illumina Analyzer GII, and to
generate amplicons of sufficient length to undergo bridge-amplification during cluster formation. Thus, primers
were designed to generate amplicons that were at least 110 bp, which when combined with the universal adaptors
(Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA) used for cluster amplification, resulted in DNA molecules of at least 200bp. Primer
sequences were identified, and primer sets i.e. forward and reverse primers, were synthesized by Integrated DNA
Technologies (San Diego, CA), and stored as a 1ptM solution to be used for amplifying polymorphic target
sequences as described in Examples 5-8. Table 1Oprovieds the RefSNP (rs) accession ID numbers, the primers
used for amplifying the target cfDNA sequence, and the sequences of the amplicons comprising the possible SNP
                                                          -61-

alleles that would be generated using the primers. The SNPs given in Table 10 were used for the simultaneous
amplification of 13 target sequences in a multiplexed assay for determining simultaneously the fetal fraction and the
presence or absence of an aneuploidy in cfDNA samples derived from pregnant women. The panel provided in
Table 10 is an exemplary SNP panel. Fewer or more SNPs can be employed to enrich the fetal and maternal DNA
for polymorphic target nucleic acids. Additional SNPs that can be used include the SNPs given in Table 11. The
SNPs in Table 11 have been validated in multiplex PCR amplifications, and sequenced using the Genomell A
analyzer as described above. The SNP alleles in Tables 10 and 11 are shown in bold and are underlined.

                            Simultaneous determination of Aneuploidy and Fetal fraction:
              Enrichment of fetal and maternal nucleic acids in a cfDNA sequencing library sample
[00266] To determine simultaneously the fetal fraction and the presence or absence of an aneuploidy in a maternal
sample a primary sequencing library of fetal and maternal nucleic acids was enriched for polymorphic target nucleic
acid sequences, and sequenced as follows.
[00267] Purified cfDNA was prepared from a maternal plasma sample as described in Example 1. A first portion of
the purified cfDNA sample was used to prepare a primary sequencing library using the abbreviated protocol
described in Example 2. A second portion of the purified cfDNA sample was used for amplifying polymorphic
target nucleic acid sequences i.e. SNPs, and prepare a target sequencing library as follows. cfDNA contained in 5pl
of purified cfDNA was amplified in a reaction volume of 50pl containing 7.5pl of a 1pM primer mix (Table 5),
10gpl of NEB 5X Mastermix and 27 pl water. Thermal cycling was performed with the Gene Amp9700 (Applied
Biosystems). Using the following cycling conditions: incubating at 95 0 C for 1 minute, followed by 30 cycles at
95 0 C for 20 seconds, 68 0 C for 1 minute, and 68 0 C for 30s, which was followed by a final incubation at 680 C for 5
minutes. A final hold at 40 C was added until the samples were removed for combining with the unamplified portion
of the purified cfDNA sample. The amplified product was purified using the Agencourt AMPure XP PCR
purification system (Part No. A63881; Beckman Coulter Genomics, Danvers, MA). A final hold at 40 C was added
until the samples were removed for preparing the target library. The amplified product was analyzed with a 2100
Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Sunnyvale, CA), and the concentration of amplified product determined. One
fifth of the purified amplified product was used to prepare a target sequencing library of amplified polymorphic
nucleic acids as described in Example 2. The primary and the target sequencing libraries were each diluted to
10nM, and the target library was combined at a ratio of 1:9 with the sequencing library to provide an enriched
sequencing library. Sequencing of the enriched library was performed as described in Example. Analysis of the
sequencing data for determining aneuploidy was performed as described in Example 3 using the hg 18 human
genome as the reference genome. Analysis of the sequencing data for determining fetal fraction was performed as
follows. Concomitant to the analysis for determining aneuploidy, the sequencing data was analyzed to determine
the fetal fraction. Following the transfer of the image and base call files to the Unix server running the Illumina
"Genome Analyzer Pipeline" software version 1.51 as described in Example 2c., the 36bp reads were aligned to a
'SNP genome' using the BOWTIE program. The SNP genome was identified as the grouping of the polymorphic
DNA sequences i.e. SEQ ID NOS:1-56, that encompass the alleles of the 13 SNP disclosed in Table 10 in Example
7. Only reads that mapped uniquely to the SNP genome were used for the analysis of fetal fraction. Reads that
matched perfectly to the SNP genome were counted as tags and filtered. Of the remaining reads, only reads having
one or two mismatches were counted as tags and included in the analysis. Tags mapped to each of the SNP alleles
were counted, and the fetal fraction was determined. About a million of the total number of sequence tags obtained
from sequencing the enriched library corresponded to tags mapping to the SNP reference genome. Figure 17 shows
a graph of the ratio of the number of sequence tags mapped to each chromosome and the total number of tags
mapped to all chromosomes (1-22, X and Y) obtained from sequencing an unenriched cfDNA library (e), and
cfDNA library enriched with 5% (m) or 10% (+) amplified multiplex SNP library. The graph indicates that
combining a library of amplified polymorphic sequences with a library of unamplified sequences from the maternal
sample does not affect the sequencing information used for determining aneuploidy. Examples of determination of
                                                             -68-

fetal fraction for samples obtained from subjects carrying a fetus with a chromosomal aneuploidy are given in
Tables 12, 13, and 14 below.
a.        Determination of fetal fraction
[00268] Fetal fraction was calculated as:
       % fetal fraction allele, = ((EFetal sequence tags for allele.) / (EMaternal sequence tags for allelex)) x 100
where allelex is an informative allele.

b.       Determination of aneuploidy
[00269] Determination of aneuploidy of chromosomes 21, 13, 18 and X was performed using chromosome doses as
described in Example 4. Qualified chromosome dose, variance and differentiability for chromosomes 21, 18, 13, X,
and Y are given in Tables X and Y. Ranking of identified normalizing chromosomes by chromosome doses
determined from sequencing of the enriched library was the same as that determined from sequencing a primary
(unenriched) library of Example 4. Figure 17 shows that sequencing of a library that has been enriched for
polymorphic target sequences e.g. SNPs, is not affected by the inclusion of the amplified SNP products.

[00270] Chromosome 21 dose was determined using chromosome 14 as the normalizing chromosome; chromosome
13 dose was determined using the group of chromosomes 3, 4, 5, and 6 as the normalizing chromosome;
chromosome 18 dose was determined using chromosome 8 as the normalizing chromosome; and chromosome X
dose was determined using chromosome 4 as the normalizing chromosome. Thresholds were calculated to be 2
standard deviations above and below the mean determined in the qualified samples.
[00271] Table 12 shows the data for the determination of fetal fraction in exemplary samples. Calculated
chromosome dose values for chromosomes 21, 18, 13, X and Y in corresponding exemplary test samples are given

[00274] Tables 10 and 11 provide the calculated dose for chromosome 13 in a test sample (51236). The calculated
threshold for the positive diagnosis of T13 aneuploidy was set at 2 standard deviations from the mean of the
qualified (non-T 13) samples. The chromosome dose for chromosome 13 provided in Table 10 was calculated using
sequence tag density for chromosome 4 as the normalizing chromosome, while the dose given on Table 11 was
determined using the average of the sequence tag densities ratios for the group of chromosomes 3, 4, 5, and 6 as the
normalizing chromosome. A diagnosis for T13 was given based on the chromosome dose in the test sample being
greater than the set threshold. One T13 sample was identified using chromosome doses, and were confirmed to be
T13 by karyotyping.
[00275] The data show that the combination of chromosomes 3, 4, 5, and 6 provide a variability (1.06) that is
similar than that of chromosome 4 (1.01), demonstrating that a group of chromosomes can be used as the
normalizing chromosome to determine chromosome doses and identify aneuploidies.

[00276] Three samples having a chromosome dose less than that of the set threshold were identified as having less
than one X chromosome. The same samples were determined to have a Y chromosome dose that was less than the
set threshold, indicating that the samples did not have a Y chromosome.
[00277] The calculated doses for chromosomes X and Y in the exemplary monosomy X test sample (54430) are
given in Table 12. Chromosome 4 was selected as the normalizing chromosome to calculate the dose for
chromosome X; and all chromosomes i.e. 1-22, and Y, were used as the normalizing chromosomes. The calculated
threshold for the positive diagnosis of Turner Syndrome (monosomy X) was set for the X chromosome at < -2
standard deviations from the mean, and for the absence of the Y chromosome at < - 2 standard deviations from the
mean for qualified (non-monosomy X) samples.

[00278] Thus, the method enables the simultaneous determination of chromosomal aneuploidies and fetal fraction
by massively parallel sequencing of a maternal sample comprising a mixture of fetal and maternal cfDNA that has
been enriched for a plurality of polymorphic sequences each comprising a SNP. In this example, the mixture of fetal
and maternal nucleic acids was enriched by combining a portion of a sequencing library that was constructed from
amplified fetal and maternal polymorphic sequences with a sequencing library that was constructed from the
remaining unamplified original fetal and maternal cfDNA mixture.

[00279] To enrich the fetal and maternal cfDNA contained in a purified sample of cfDNA extracted from a
maternal plasma sample, a portion of the purified cfDNA was used for amplifying polymorphic target nucleic acid
sequences each comprising one SNP chosen from the panel of SNPs given in Table 6.
[00280] Cell-free plasma was obtained from a maternal blood sample, and cfDNA was purified from the plasma
sample as described in Example 1. The final concentration was determined to be 92.8pg/pl.
[00281] cfDNA contained in 5pl of purified cfDNA was amplified in a reaction volume of 50pl containing 7.5pl of
a luM primer mix (Table 5), 10pl of NEB 5X Mastermix and 27 pl water. Thermal cycling was performed with the
Gene Amp9700 (Applied Biosystems). Using the following cycling conditions: incubating at 95 0 C for 1 minute,
followed by 30 cycles at 95 0 C for 20 seconds, 68 0 C for 1 minute, and 68 0 C for 30s, which was followed by a final
incubation at 68 0 C for 5 minutes. A final hold at 40 C was added until the samples were removed for combining
with the unamplified portion of the purified cfDNA sample. The amplified product was purified using the
Agencourt AMPure XP PCR purification system (Part No. A63881; Beckman Coulter Genomics, Danvers, MA),
and the concentration quantified using the Nanodrop 2000 (Thermo Scientific, Wilmington, DE). The purified
amplification product was diluted 1:10 in water and 0.9 pl (37 lpg) added to 40gpl of purified cfDNA sample to
obtain a 10% spike. The enriched fetal and maternal cfDNA present in the purified cfDNA sample was used for
preparing a sequencing library, and was sequenced as described in Example 2.
[00282] Table 13 provides the tag counts obtained for each of chromosomes 21, 18, 13, X and Y i.e. sequence tag
density, and the tag counts obtained for the informative polymorphic sequences contained in the SNP reference
genome .i.e. SNP tag density. The data show that sequencing information can be obtained from sequencing a single
library constructed from a purified maternal cfDNA sample that has been enriched for sequences comprising SNPs
to simultaneously determine the presence or absence of aneuploidy and the fetal fraction. In the example given, the
data show that the fraction of fetal DNA in plasma sample AFR1 05 was quantifiable from the sequencing results of
five informative SNPs and determined to be 3.84%. Sequence tag densities are provided for chromosomes 21, 13,
18, X and Y. Sample AFR105 was the only sample that was subjected to the protocol of enriching purified cfDNA
for amplified polymorphic sequences. Thus, coefficients of variation and tests for differentiability were not
provided. However, the example shows that the enrichment protocol provides the requisite tag counts for
determining aneuploidy and fetal fraction from a single sequencing process.

                         Enrichment of fetal and maternal nucleic acids in a plasma sample
[00283] To enrich the fetal and maternal cfDNA contained in an original plasma sample derived from a pregnant
woman, a portion the original plasma sample was used for amplifying polymorphic target nucleic acid sequences
each comprising one SNP chosen from the panel of SNPs given in Table 14, and a portion of the amplified product
was combined with the remaining original plasma sample.
[00284] cfDNA contained in 15pl of cell-free plasma was amplified in a reaction volume of 50pl containing 9ul of
a 1 pM mixture of primers (15 plexTable 5), 1pl of Phusion blood DNA polymerase, 25ul of the 2X Phusion blood
PCR buffer containing deoxynucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs: dATP, dCTP, dGTP and dTTP). Thermal cycling
was performed with the Gene Amp9700 (Applied Biosystems) using the following cycling conditions: incubating at
95 0 C for 3 minutes, followed by 35 cycles at 95 0 C for 20 seconds, 55 0 C for 30s, and 70'C for 1 minute, which was
followed by a final incubation at 68 0 C for 5 minutes. A final hold at 4 0 C was added until the samples were removed
for combining with the unamplified portion of the cell-free plasma. The amplified product was diluted 1:2 with
water and analyzed using the Bioanalyzer. An additional 3 pl of amplified product was diluted with 11.85 pl of water
to obtain a final concentration of 2ng/pl. 2.2pl of the diluted amplified product was combined with the remaining

plasma sample. The enriched fetal and maternal cfDNA present in the plasma sample was purified as described in
Example 1, and used for preparing a sequencing library. Sequencing and analysis of the sequencing data was
performed as described in Examples 2 and 3.
[00285] The results are given in Table 21. In the example given, the data show that the fraction of fetal DNA in
plasma sample SAC2517 was quantifiable from the sequencing results of an informative SNP and determined to be
9.5%. In the example given, sample SAC2517 was shown by karyotyping to be unaffected for aneuploidies of
chromosomes 21, 13, 18, X and Y. Sequence tag densities are provided for chromosomes 21, 13, 18, X and Y.
Sample SAC2517 was the only sample that was subjected to the protocol of enriching plasma cfDNA for amplified
polymorphic sequences. Thus, coefficients of variation and tests for differentiability could not determined. The
example demonstrates that enriching the mixture of fetal and maternal cfDNA present in a plasma sample for
nucleic acid sequences that comprise at least one informative SNP can be used to provide the requisite sequence and
SNP tag counts for determining aneuploidy and fetal fraction from a single sequencing process.

[00286] To simultaneously determine the presence or absence of an aneuploidy and the fetal fraction in a mixture of
fetal and maternal cfDNA obtained from a maternal sample, the mixture is enriched for polymorphic sequences
comprising STRs, sequenced and the data analyzed. Enrichment can be of a sequencing library as described in
Example 8, of a purified cfDNA sample as described in Example 9, or of a plasma sample as described in
Example10. In each case, sequencing information is obtained from sequencing a single library, which enables for
simultaneously determining the presence or absence of an aneuploidy and the fetal fraction. Preferably, the
sequencing library is prepared using the abbreviated protocol provided in Example 2.
[00287] STRs that are amplified are chosen from the codis and non-codis STRs disclosed in Table 22, and
amplification of the polymorphic STR sequences is obtained using the corresponding sets of primers provided.
Some of the STRs have been disclosed and/or analyzed previously for determining fetal fraction are listed in Table

[00288] miniSTRs provided in Table 22 have been used successfully to determine fetal fraction in plasma cfDNA
samples obtained from women pregnant with either male or female fetuses, using capillary electrophoresis (see
Table 24 in Example 15) to identify and quantify the fetal and maternal alleles. Therefore, it is expected that
polymorphic sequences comprising other STRs e.g. the remaining STRs of Table 22 can be used to determine fetal
fraction by massively parallel sequencing methods.
[00289] Sequencing of the library enriched for polymorphic STR sequences is performed using a NGS technology
e.g. massively parallel sequencing by synthesis. Sequence reads of lengths of at least 100 bp are aligned to a
reference genome e.g. the human reference genome NCBI36/hgl8 sequence, and to an STR genome, and the
number of sequence tags mapped to the reference human genome and the STR reference genome obtained for
informative alleles is used to determine the presence or absence of aneuploidy and the fetal fraction, respectively.
The STR reference genome includes the sequences of amplicons amplified from the given primers.

amplifying the target sequences comprising the tandem SNPs are designed to encompass both SNP sites. For
example, the forward primer is designed to encompass the first SNP, and the reverse primer is designed to
encompass the second of the tandem SNP pair i.e. each of the SNP sites in the tandem pair is encompassed within
the 36 bp generated by the sequencing method. Paired-end sequencing can be used to identify all sequences

[00291] Sample preparation and enrichment of cfDNA sequencing library, a purified cfDNA sample, and a plasma
sample is performed according to the method described in Examples 8, 9, and 10, respectively. All sequencing
libraries are prepared as described in Example 2a., and sequencing is performed as described in Example 2b and
including paired-end sequencing. Analysis of the sequencing data for the determination of fetal aneuploidy is
performed as described in Examples 4 and 5. Concomitant to the analysis for determining aneuploidy, the
sequencing data is analyzed to determine the fetal fraction as follows. Following the transfer of the image and base
call files to the Unix server running the Illumina "Genome Analyzer Pipeline" software version 1.51 as described,
the 36bp reads are aligned to a 'tandem SNP genome' using the BOWTIE program. The tandem SNP genome is
identified as the grouping of the DNA sequences that encompass the alleles of the 58 tandem SNP pairs disclosed
above. Only reads that mapped uniquely to the tandem SNP genome are used for the analysis of fetal fraction.
Reads that match perfectly to the tandem SNP genome are counted as tags and filtered. Of the remaining reads, only
reads having one or two mismatches are counted as tags and included in the analysis. Tags mapped to each of the
tandem SNP alleles are counted, and the fetal fraction is determined essentially as described in Example 6 above but

accounting for tags mapped to the two tandem SNP alles x and y present on each of the amplified polymorphic
target nucleic acid sequences that are amplified to enrich the samples i.e.
    % fetal fraction allelexy = ((EFetal sequence tags for allelexy) / (EMaternal sequence tags for allelex,,)) x 100
Optionally, the fraction of fetal nucleic acids in the mixture of fetal and maternal nucleic acids is calculated for each
of the informative allele (allelexy) as follows:
 % fetal fraction allelexy = ((2 X    EFetal sequence tags for allelexy) / (EMaternal sequence tags for allelex,,)) x 100,
to compensate for the presence of 2 sets of tandem fetal alleles, one being masked by the maternal background.
Tandem SNP sequences are informative when the mother is heterozygous and a third paternal haplotype is present,
permitting a quantitative comparison between the maternally inherited haplotype and the paternally inherited
haplotype to calculate the fetal fraction by calculating a Haplotype Ratio (HR). The percent fetal fraction is
calculated for at least 1, at least 2, at least 3, at least 4, at least 5, at least 6, at least 7, at least 8, at least 9, at least 10,
at least 11, at least 12, at least 13, at least 14, at least 15, at least 16, at least 17, at least 18, at least 19, at least 20, at
least 25, at least 30, at least 40 or more informative sets of tandem alleles. In one embodiment, the fetal fraction is
the average fetal fraction determined for at least 3 informative sets of tandem alleles.

[00292] To determine the fraction of fetal cfDNA in a maternal sample, target polymorphic nucleic acid sequences
each comprising a SNP were amplified and used for preparing a target library for sequencing in a massively parallel
fashion.
[00293] cfDNA was extracted as described in Example 1. A target sequencing library was prepared as follows.
cfDNA contained in 5pl of purified cfDNA was amplified in a reaction volume of 50pl containing 7.5pl of a 1pM
primer mix (Table 10), 10pl of NEB 5X Mastermix and 27 pl water. Thermal cycling was performed with the Gene
Amp9700 (Applied Biosystems) using the following cycling conditions: incubating at 95 0 C for 1 minute, followed
by 20-30 cycles at 95 0 C for 20 seconds, 68 0 C for 1 minute, and 68 0 C for 30s, which was followed by a final
incubation at 68 0 C for 5 minutes. A final hold at 40 C was added until the samples were removed for combining
with the unamplified portion of the purified cfDNA sample. The amplified product was purified using the
Agencourt AMPure XP PCR purification system (Part No. A63881; Beckman Coulter Genomics, Danvers, MA),
and the concentration quantified using the Nanodrop 2000 (Thermo Scientific, Wilmington, DE). A final hold at
40 C was added until the samples were removed for preparing the target library. The amplified product was analyzed
with a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Sunnyvale, CA), and the concentration of amplified product
determined. A sequencing library of amplified target nucleic acids was prepared using the abbreviated protocol
described in Example 2, and was sequenced in a massively parallel fashion using sequencing-by-synthesis with
reversible dye terminators and according to the Illumina protocol. Analysis and counting of tags mapped to a
reference genome consisting of 26 sequences (13 pairs each representing two alleles) comprising a SNP i.e. SEQ ID
NO:1-56 was performed as described.
[00294] Table 23 provides the tag counts obtained from sequencing the target library, and the calculated fetal
fraction derived from sequencing data.

[00295] The results show that polymorphic nucleic acid sequences each comprising at least one SNP can be
amplified from cfDNA derived from a maternal plasma sample to construct a library that can be sequenced in a
massively parallel fashion to determine the fraction of fetal nucleic acids in the maternal sample. Massively parallel
sequencing methods for determining fetal fraction can be used in combination with other methods for providing
diagnosis of fetal aneuploidy and other prenatal tests.

       Determination of Fetal Fraction by Massively Parallel Sequencing of a Target Library Comprising
                           Polymorphic Nucleic Acids Comprising STRs or Tandem SNPs
[00296] Fetal fraction can be determined independently of the determination of aneuploidy using a target library
comprising tandem SNPs or STRs as described for the SNP target library of Example 13. To prepare a tandem SNP
target library, a portion of a purified cfDNA library comprising fetal and maternal nucleic acids is used to amplify
target sequences using a mixture of primers e.g. Tables 10 and 11. To prepare an STR library, a portion of a
purified cfDNA library comprising fetal and maternal nucleic acids is used to amplify target sequences using a
mixture of primers e.g. Table 22. The tandem SNP target library is sequenced as described in Example 12.
[00297] The target libraries are sequenced as described, and fetal fraction is determined from the number of
sequence tags mapped to the STR or tandem SNP reference genome respectively comprising all possible STR or
tandem SNP alleles encompassed by the primers. Informative alleles are identified, and the fetal fraction is
determined using the number of tags mapped to the alleles of the polymorphic sequences.

  Determination of Fetal Fraction by Capillary Electrophoresis of Polymorphic Sequences Comprising STRs
[00298] To determine fetal fraction in maternal samples comprising fetal and maternal cfDNA, peripheral blood
samples were collected from volunteer pregnant women carrying either male or female fetuses. Peripheral blood
samples were obtained and processed to provide purified cfDNA as described in Example 1
[00299] Ten microliters of cfDNA samples were analyzed using the AmpFlSTR@ MiniFilerTM PCR amplification
kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, cfDNA contained
                                                          -87-

in 10 pal was amplified in a reaction volume of 25 pl containing 5pL fluorescently labeled primers (AmpFlSTR@
MiniFilerTM Primer Set), and the AmpFlSTR@ MiniFilerTM Master Mix, which includes AmpliTaq Gold DNA
polymerase and associated buffer, salt (1.5 mM MgCl2), and 200 ptM deoxynucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs:
dATP, dCTP, dGTP and dTTP). The fluorescently labeled primers are forward primers that are labeled with
6FAMTM, VICTM,       NEDTM, and PETrM dyes. Thermal cycling was performed with the Gene Amp9700 (Applied
Biosystems) using the following cycling conditions: incubating at 95 0 C for 10 minutes, followed by 30 cycles at
94 0 C for 20 seconds, 59 0 C for 2 minute, and 72 0 C for 1 minute, which was followed by a final incubation at 60'C
for 45 minutes. A final hold at 40 C was added until the samples were removed for analysis. The amplified product
was prepared by diluting lul of amplified product in 8.7ul Hi-DiTM formamide (Applied Biosystems) and 0.3 pl
GeneScanTM-500 LIZ_ internal size standard (Applied Biosystems), and analyzed with an ABI PRISM3130xl
Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems) using Data Collection HID_G5_POP4 (Applied Biosystems), and a 36-cm
capillary array. All genotyping was performed with GeneMapperID v3.2 software (Applied Biosystems) using
manufacturer provided allelic ladders and bins and panels.
[00300]              All genotyping measurement were performed on the Applied Biosystems 3130x Genetic
Analyzer, using a +0.5-nt "window" around the size obtained for each allele to allow for detection and correct
assignment of alleles. Any sample allele whose size was outside the +0.5-nt window was determined to be OL i.e.
"Off Ladder". OL alleles are alleles of a size that is not represented in the AmpFlSTR@ MiniFilerTM Allelic Ladder
or an allele that does not correspond to an allelic ladder, but whose size is just outside a window because of
measurement error. The minimum peak height threshold of >50 RFU was set based on validation experiments
performed to avoid typing when stochastic effects are likely to interfere with accurate interpretation of mixtures.
The calculation of fetal fraction is based on averaging all informative markers. Informative markers are identified
by the presence of peaks on the electropherogram that fall within the parameters of preset bins for the STRs that are
analyzed.
[00301] Calculations of fetal fraction were performed using the average peak height for major and minor alleles at
every STR locus determined from triplicate injections. The rules applied to the calculation are:
1.         off-ladder allele (OL) data for alleles are not included in the calculation; and
2.         only peak heights derived from >50 RFU (relative fluorescence units) are included in the calculation
3.         if only one bin is present the marker is deemed non-informative; and
4.         if a second bin is called but the peaks of the first and second bins are within 50-70% of their relative
fluorescence units (RFU) in peak height, the minority fraction is not measured and the marker is deemed not
informative.
[00302] The fraction of the minor allele for any given informative marker is calculated by dividing the peak height
of the minor component by the sum of the peak height for the major component, and expressed as a percent was first
calculated for each informative locus as
           fetal fraction = (Epeak height of minor allele / Z peak height of major allele(s)) X 100,
The fetal fraction for a sample comprising two or more informative STRs, would be calculated as the average of the
fetal fractions calculated for the two or more informative markers.

[00304] The results show that cfDNA can be used for determining the presence or absence of fetal DNA as

fraction, and for determining fetal gender as indicated by the presence or absence of the Amelogenin allele.

     Use of Fetal Fraction to Set Thresholds and Estimate Minimum Sample Size in Aneuploidy Detection
[00305] Counts of sequence matches to different chromosomes are manipulated to generate a score which will vary
with chromosomal copy number that can be interpreted to identify chromosomal amplification or deletion. For
example, such a score could be generated by comparing the relative amount of a sequence tags on a chromosome
undergoing copy number changes to a chromosome known to be a euploid. Examples of scores that can be used to
identify amplification or deletion include but are not limited to: counts for the chromosome of interest divided by
counts of another chromosome from the same experimental run, the counts for the chromosome of interest divided
by the total number of counts from the experimental run, comparison of counts from the sample of interest versus a
separate control sample. Without loss of generality, it can be assumed that scores will increase as copy number
increases. Knowledge of fetal fraction can be used to set "cutoff' thresholds to call "aneuploidy", "normal", or
"marginal" (uncertain) states. Then, calculations are performed to estimate the minimum number of sequences
required to achieve adequate sensitivity (i.e. probability of correctly identifying an aneuploidy state).
                                                           -89-

[00306] Figure 19 is a plot of two different populations of scores. The x-axis is score and the y-axis is frequency.
Scores on samples of chromosomes without aneuploidy can have a distribution shown in Figure 19A. Figure 19B
illustrates a hypothetical distribution of a population of scores on samples with an amplified chromosome. Without
loss of generality, the graphs and equations show the case of a univariate score where the aneuploidy condition
represents an amplification of copy number. Multivariate cases and/or reduction/deletion abnormalities are simple
extensions or rearrangements of the given descriptions and are intend to fall within the scope of this art.
[00307] The amount of "overlap" between the populations can determine how well normal and aneuploidy cases
can be discriminated. In general, increasing fetal fraction, ff, increases discrimination power by separating the two
population centers (by moving "C2," the "Center of Aneuploidy Scores", and increasing "d," causing the
populations to overlap less. Furthermore, an increase in the absolute value of the magnitude, m, (for example
having four copies of the chromosome instead of a trisomy) of the amplification will also increase separation of
population centers leading to higher power (i.e. higher probability of correctly identifying aneuploidy states).
[00308] Increasing the number of sequences generated, N, reduces standard deviations "sdevA" and/or "sdevB," the
spread of the two populations of scores, which also causes the populations to overlap less.
Setting Thresholds and Estimating Sample Size
[00309] The following procedure can be used to set "c", the critical value for calling "aneuploidy", "normal", or
"marginal" (uncertain) states. Without loss of generality, one sided statistical tests are used below.
[00310] First, an acceptable false positive rate, FP (sometimes also called "type I error" or "specificity"), is decided,
which is the probability of a false positive or falsely calling aneuploidy. For example, FP can be at least, or about
0.001, 0.002, 0.003, 0.004, 0.005, 0.006, 0.007, 0.008, 0.009, 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04, 0.05, 0.06, 0.07, 0.08, 0.09, or
0.1.
[00311] Second, the value of "c" can be determined by solving the equation: FP = integral from c to infinity of
(fl (x)dx).
                                 FP =    fl(x)dX                               (Equation 1)
                                       C
[00312] Once a critical value, c, has been determined, the minimum number sequences required to achieve a certain
TP = True positive rate can be estimated. The true positive rate can be, for example, about 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, or 0.9.
In one embodiment, the true positive rate can be 0.8. In other words, N is the minimum number of sequences
required to identify aneuploidy 100*TP percent of the time. N = minimum number such that TP = integral from c to
infinity of f2(x,ff)dx > 0.8. N is determined by solving
                            minN sat. {TB         f 2(x, N)dx}                      (Equation 2)
                                                C
[00313] In classical statistical tests fl and f2 are often F, non-central F distributions (a special case of t and non
central t distributions) although that is not a necessary condition for this application.
Setting "Levels" of Thresholds to Give More Control of Errors
[00314] Thresholds can also be set in stages using the above methods. For example, a threshold can be set for high
confidence calling of "aneuploidy', say ca, using FP 0.001 and a "marginal" threshold, say cb, using FP 0.05. In
this case if Score, S:
           (S > ca)           then call "Trisomy"
           (cb > S <= ca)     then call "Marginal"
                                                            -90-

          (S < cb)           then call "Normal"
Some Trivial Generalizations Falling Within Scope of this Art
[00315] Different values for thresholds such as TP, FP, etc can be used. Procedures can be run in any order. For
example, one can start with N and solve for c, etc. Distributions can depend on ff so that fl (x,N,ff), f2(x,N,ff),
and/or other variables. The above integral equations can be solved by reference to tables or by iterative computer
methods. A non-centrality parameter can be estimated and power can be read from standard statistical tables.
Statistical power and sample sizes may be derived from calculation or estimation of expected mean squares. Closed
form theoretical distributions such as f, t, non-central t, normal, etc. or estimates (kernel or other) can be used to
model the distributions fl, f2. Empirical threshold setting and parameter selection using Receiver Operator
Characteristic Curves (ROC) can be used and collated with fetal fraction. Various estimates of distribution spread
(variance, mean absolute deviation, inter quartile range, etc.) may be used. Various estimates of distribution center
(mean, median, etc.) can be used. Two sided as opposed to one sided statistical tests can be used. The simple
hypothesis test can be reformulated as linear or non-linear regression. Combinatorial methods, simulation (e.g.,
monte carlo), maximization (e.g., expectation maximization), iterative, or other methods can be used independently
or in conjunction with the above to establish statistical power or thresholds.

[00316] Sequencing data obtained for the samples described in Examples 4 and 5, and shown in figures 9-13 were
further analyzed to illustrate the sensitivity of the method in successfully identifying aneuploidies in maternal
samples. Normalized chromosome doses for chromosomes 21, 18, 13, X and Y were analyzed as a distribution

is shown as the denominator (X-axis).
[00317] Figure 20 (A) shows the distribution of chromosome doses relative to the standard deviation from the mean
for chromosome 21 dose in the unaffected (normal) samples (o) and the trisomy 21 samples (T2 1; A) when using
chromosome 14 as the normalizing chromosome for chromosome 21. Figure 20 (B) shows the distribution of
chromosome doses relative to the standard deviation from the mean for chromosome 18 dose in the unaffected
samples (o) and the trisomy 18 samples (T18; A) when using chromosome 8 as the normalizing chromosome for
chromosome 18. Figure 20 (C) shows the distribution of chromosome doses relative to the standard deviation from
the mean for chromosome 13 dose in the unaffected samples (o) and the trisomy 13 samples (T13; A), using the
average sequence tag density of the group of chromosomes 3, 4, 5, and 6 as the normalizing chromosome to
determine the chromosome dose for chromosome 13. Figure 20 (D) shows the distribution of chromosome doses
relative to the standard deviation from the mean for chromosome X dose in the unaffected female samples (o), the
unaffected male samples (A), and the monosomy X samples (XO; +) when using chromosome 4 as the normalizing
chromosome for chromosome X. Figure 20 (E) shows the distribution of chromosome doses relative to the standard
deviation from the mean for chromosome Y dose in the unaffected male samples (o), the unaffected female sample s
(A), and the monosomy X samples (+), when using the average sequence tag density of the group of chromosomes
1-22 and X as the normalizing chromosome to determine the chromosome dose for chromosome Y.
[00318] The data show that trisomy 21, trisomy 18, trisomy 13 were clearly distinguishable from the unaffected
(normal) samples. The monosomy X samples were easily identifiable as having chromosome X dose that were
