   ABSTRACT:
           A method for a refrigeration system includes determining whether a parallel
   compressor of the refrigeration system is operational, directing refrigerant discharged
   from a first compressor of the refrigeration system to a second compressor of the
 5 refrigeration system if the parallel compressor is not operational, and directing the
   refrigerant discharged from the first compressor to the parallel compressor if the
   parallel compressor is operational. The first compressor of the refrigeration system is
   operable to compress refrigerant discharged from a first refrigeration case, the second
   compressor is operable to compress refrigerant discharged from a second refrigeration
10 case, and the parallel compressor, when operational, is operable to provide parallel
   compression for the second compressor.

              SYSTEM FOR CONTROLLING A REFRIGERATION SYSTEM
                             WITH A PARALLEL COMPRESSOR
   TECHNICAL FIELD
 5         This disclosure relates generally to an refrigeration system. More specifically,
   this disclosure relates to a system for controlling a refrigeration system with a parallel
   compressor.
   BACKGROUND
10         Refrigeration systems can be used to regulate the environment within an
   enclosed space.     Various types of refrigeration systems, such as residential and
   commercial, may be used to maintain cold temperatures within an enclosed space
   such as a refrigerated case. To maintain cold temperatures within refrigerated cases,
   refrigeration systems control the temperature and pressure of refrigerant as it moves
15 through the refrigeration system. When controlling the temperature and pressure of
   the refrigerant, refrigeration systems consume power.         It is generally desirable to
   operate refrigeration systems efficiently in order to avoid wasting power.
   SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE
20         According to one embodiment, a method for a refrigeration system includes
   determining whether a parallel compressor of the refrigeration system is operational,
   directing refrigerant discharged from a first compressor of the refrigeration system to
   a second compressor of the refrigeration system if the parallel compressor is not
   operational, and directing the refrigerant discharged from the first compressor to the
25 parallel compressor if the parallel compressor is operational. The first compressor of
   the refrigeration system is operable to compress refrigerant discharged from a first
   refrigeration case, the second compressor is operable to compress refrigerant
   discharged from a second refrigeration case, and the parallel compressor, when
   operational, is operable to provide parallel compression for the second compressor.
30         Certain embodiments may provide one or more technical advantages.              For
   example, an embodiment of the present disclosure may result in more efficient
   operation of refrigeration system. As another example, an embodiment of the present
   disclosure may permit a parallel compressor of a refrigeration system to remain in
   operation for a longer period of time relative to refrigeration systems that include a
                                                1

   parallel compressor in the traditional configuration.       As yet another example, an
   embodiment of the present invention may reduce the number of on/off cycles of the
   parallel compressor relative to refrigeration systems that include a parallel compressor
   in the traditional configuration, thereby improving the stability of the refrigeration
 5 system.    Certain embodiments may include none, some, or all of the above technical
   advantages. One or more other technical advantages may be readily apparent to one
   skilled in the art from the figures, descriptions, and claims included herein.

10         For a more complete understanding of the present disclosure, reference is now
   made to the following description, taken in conjunction with the accompanying
   drawings, in which:
           FIGURE 1 illustrates an example refrigeration system according to certain
   embodiments of the present disclosure.

   other embodiments of the present disclosure.
           FIGURE 3 is a flow chart illustrating a method of operation for a refrigeration
   system, according to certain embodiments of the present disclosure.
           FIGURE 4 illustrates an example of a controller of a refrigeration system,
20 according to certain embodiments.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION
           Embodiments of the present disclosure and its advantages are best understood
   by referring to FIGURES 1 through 4 of the drawings, like numerals being used for
25 like and corresponding parts of the various drawings.
           A refrigeration system can be used to maintain cool temperatures within an
   enclosed space, such as a refrigerated case for storing food, beverages, etc.       This
   disclosure contemplates a configuration of a refrigeration system that may provide
   energy-efficient benefits. One way to improve the efficiency of a refrigeration system
30 is to include a parallel compressor. Parallel compression refers to the inclusion and
   operation of at least one parallel compressor in a refrigeration system. Generally, a
   parallel compressor operates "in parallel" to another compressor of the refrigeration
   system, thereby reducing the amount of compression that the other compressor needs
   to be apply to refrigerant circulating through the refrigeration system. Inclusion of an
                                                 2

   operational parallel compressor may be associated with certain energy efficiency
   benefits. For example, including a parallel compressor in a transcritical refrigeration
   system circulating C02 refrigerant may improve efficiency of the refrigeration system
   by 10-15%. Accordingly, a refrigeration system may realize efficiency benefits when
 5 the parallel compressor is operational.     However, the parallel compressor may not
   always be operational.
           Generally, a parallel compressor is operational only when the flow rate of
   refrigerant into the parallel compressor is greater than an operation threshold (e.g.,
   about 50% of design flow rate).         The flow rate to the parallel compressor may
10 fluctuate based on system load and/or ambient temperature. As a result, a reduction in
   system load and/or ambient temperature of the environment of the refrigeration
   system may cause the flow rate to drop below the operation threshold, in turn causing
   the parallel compressor to turn off. The refrigeration system does not realize the
   efficiency benefits of the parallel compressor when the parallel compressor is not
15 operational.
           In a refrigeration system that includes a parallel compressor in the traditional
   configuration, the parallel compressor receives refrigerant in the form of flash gas
   from a flash tank.      When the system load and/or the ambient temperature of the
   environment of the refrigeration system is low, the parallel compressor may not be
20 operational because the flow rate of refrigerant from the flash tank may fall below the
   operation threshold.       Stated differently, the parallel compressor may not be
   operational when (1) an ambient temperature of the environment surrounding the
   refrigeration system falls below a temperature threshold; and/or (2) a load of the
   refrigeration system is below a load threshold. As a result, the parallel compressor
25 may frequently cycle between on and off. For example, a parallel compressor is not
   operational when the system load or the ambient temperature is relatively low (e.g.,
   when the system load is 80% and the ambient temperature is below 24'C or when the
   ambient temperature falls below 22C) because the flow rate of refrigerant to the
   parallel compressor falls below the operation threshold.
30         This disclosure contemplates a configuration of a refrigeration system that
   extends the duration of operation of a parallel compressor in a refrigeration system
   relative to the traditional configuration, thereby providing efficiency benefits. As an
   example, suppose that a flow rate of refrigerant must be greater than X in order for the
   parallel compressor to remain operational. In a traditional configuration, this would
                                                3

   mean that the parallel compressor would not be operational if the flow rate of
   refrigerant from the flash tank was less than X. By contrast, embodiments of the
   present disclosure enable the parallel compressor to receive refrigerant not only from
   the flash tank, but also from another compressor of the refrigeration system. As a
 5 result, even if the flow rate of refrigerant from the flash tank falls below X, in certain
   conditions, the refrigerant from the other compressor may provide sufficient flow
   such that the total flow rate to the parallel compressor exceeds X and the parallel
   compressor can remain operational.
            Accordingly, certain embodiments provide for optimizing power usage by
10 increasing the duration of operation for a parallel compressor of a refrigeration system
   relative to a refrigeration system that includes a parallel compressor in the traditional
   configuration. Additionally, certain embodiments provide for reducing the number of
   on and off cycles of a parallel compressor relative to a refrigeration system including
   a parallel compressor in the traditional configuration.             This disclosure also
15 contemplates a refrigeration system having an increased flow rate of a parallel
   compressor relative to a refrigeration system including a parallel compressor in the
   traditional configuration.
            FIGURES 1 and 2 illustrate examples of a transcritical refrigeration system.
   A transcritical refrigeration system 100 may include a controller 105, at least two
20 compressors 110, a parallel compressor 120, a gas cooler 130, an expansion valve
   140, a flash tank 150, one or more evaporator valves 170 corresponding to one or
   more evaporators 160, at least one compressor valve 180, and a flash gas valve 190.
   As depicted in FIGURES 1 and 2, refrigeration system 100 includes two compressors
   (a first compressor 11 Oa and a second compressor 11 Ob), two evaporators 180 (a first
25 evaporator 160a and a second evaporator 160b), and two evaporator valves 170 (a
   first valve 170a and a second valve 170b).
            First valve 170a may be configured to discharge low-temperature (e.g., -29'C)
   liquid refrigerant to first evaporator 160a (also referred to herein as low-temperature
   ("LT") case 160a).      Second valve 170b may be configured to discharge medium
30 temperature (e.g., -7C), liquid refrigerant to evaporator 160b (also referred to herein
   as medium-temperature ("MT") case 160b). In certain embodiments, LT case 160a
   and MT case 160b may be installed in a grocery store and may be used to store frozen
   food and refrigerated fresh food, respectively. In some embodiments, first evaporator
   160a may be configured to discharge warm refrigerant vapor to first compressor 110 a
                                                 4

   and second evaporator 160b may be configured to discharge warm refrigerant vapor
   to a second compressor 11 Ob. In such a refrigeration system, first compressor 11 Oa
   compresses the warmed refrigerant from the LT case 160a and discharges the
   compressed refrigerant to parallel compressor 120 and/or second compressor 1 10b
 5 (depending on the configuration of the at least one compressor valve 180).
            When the one or more compressor valves 180 are configured such that first
   compressor 1 10a discharges the compressed refrigerant to second compressor 1 Ob,
   the compressed refrigerant discharged from first compressor 1 1Oa joins the warm
   refrigerant discharged from MT case 160b and flows to second compressor 11 Ob for
10 compression. The refrigerant discharged from second compressor 110b may then be
   discharged to gas cooler 130 for cooling, which in turn is discharged to expansion
   valve 140 which discharges mixed-state refrigerant (e.g., refrigerant is discharged in
   both vapor and liquid form). The mixed-state refrigerant then flows through flash tank
   150 where it is separated into vapor (i.e., flash gas) and liquid refrigerant. The liquid
15 refrigerant flows from the flash tank to one or more of the cases 160 through
   evaporator valves 170 and the cycle begins again.
            Both the disclosed configuration and the traditional configuration of a
   transcritical refrigeration system with a parallel compressor 120 include a connection
   from flash tank 150 to parallel compressor 120 and a connection from flash tank 150
20 to a compressor 110.       In these configurations, flash tank 150 discharges flash gas
   (refrigerant vapor) to parallel compressor        120 for compression when parallel
   compressor 120 is operational and discharges flash gas to compressor 1 10b (by
   opening/closing valve 190) when parallel compressor 120 is not operational.           As
   explained above, refrigeration system 100 may reduce its energy usage by 10-15%
25 (relative to refrigeration systems without a parallel compressor) when parallel
   compressor is operational.      As also explained above, the traditional configuration
   continuously turns off and on as the flow rate fluctuates (e.g., based on the system
   load and/or the ambient temperature).
            Unlike the disclosed configuration depicted in FIGS. 1 and 2, the traditional
30 configuration does not include a connection from first compressor 1 10a to parallel
   compressor 120.      This disclosure recognizes that discharging refrigerant from first
   compressor 1 10a to parallel compressor 120 may extend the duration of operation for
   parallel compressor 120 because it increases the flow rate of refrigerant to the
   compressor above the operation threshold.        As a result, a refrigeration system 100
                                                5

   including the disclosed configuration may save additional energy relative to a
   refrigeration system 100 with a parallel compressor in the traditional configuration.
            In some embodiments, refrigeration system 100 may be configured to circulate
   natural refrigerant such as a hydrocarbon (HC) like carbon dioxide (C0 2 ), propane
 5 (C 3H8 ), isobutane (C 4H1 io), water (H 20), and air.     Natural refrigerants may be
   associated with various environmentally conscious benefits (e.g., they do not
   contribute to ozone depletion and/or global warming effects). This disclosure makes
   reference to several example temperatures and pressures throughout and one of
   ordinary skill will recognize that such referenced temperatures and pressures may be
10 sufficient for refrigeration systems circulating a particular refrigerant and may not be
   sufficient for refrigeration systems circulating other refrigerants.        The example
   temperatures and pressures provided herein are tailored to a transcritical refrigeration
   system (i.e., a refrigeration system in which the heat rejection process occurs above
   the critical point) comprising a gas cooler and circulating the natural refrigerant C02.
15          As will be described in more detail below, FIGURES 1 and 2 illustrate
   different embodiments of a refrigeration system configuration that extends the
   operation cycle of a parallel compressor of the refrigeration system relative to the
   duration of operation of a parallel compressor of a refrigeration system having a
   traditional configuration.    FIG. 3   illustrates a method of operating a refrigeration
20 system having a disclosed configuration and FIG. 4 illustrates a controller operable to
   execute the method of FIG. 3.        In general, this disclosure recognizes discharging
   refrigerant from a first compressor to a parallel compressor when the parallel
   compressor is operational. In doing so, the parallel compressor may operate longer
   than it would in a refrigeration system wherein the first compressor does not
25 discharge to the parallel compressor. As a result, the refrigeration system may be able
   to operate using less energy than it would otherwise use.
            Refrigeration system 100 may include at least one controller 105 in some
   embodiments.       Controller 105 may be configured to direct the operations of
   refrigeration system 100. Controller 105 may be communicably coupled to one or
30 more components of refrigeration system 100 (e.g., compressors               110, parallel
   compressors 120, gas cooler 130, expansion valve 140, flash tank 150, evaporator
   valves 160, evaporators 170, compressor valve(s) 180, and flash gas valve 190). As
   such, controller 105 may be configured to control the operations of one or more
   components of refrigeration system 100.           For example, controller 105 may be
                                                  6

   configured to turn parallel compressor 120 on and off. As another example, controller
   105 may be configured to open and close compressor valve(s) 180 and/or flash gas
   valve 190.
           In some embodiments, controller 105 may further be configured to receive
 5 information about system 100 from one or more sensors 195.             As an example,
   controller 105 may receive information about the ambient temperature of the
   environment from one or more sensors 195 (e.g., sensor 195a associated with gas
   cooler 130). As another example, controller 105 may receive information about the
   system load from sensor 195b-c associated with compressors 110 and/or sensors 195d
10 associated with parallel compressors 120. As yet another example, controller 105
   may receive information about the flash gas bypass flow rate from one or more
   sensors of refrigeration system 100 (e.g., sensor 195e associated with flash tank 150).
   In some embodiments, controller 105 determines whether to operate parallel
   compressor 120 based on information received from sensors 195.            For example,
15 controller 105 may determine whether to operate parallel compressor 120 by
   comparing the flow rate of refrigerant into parallel compressor 120 to a threshold. In
   certain embodiments, the flow rate of refrigerant into parallel compressor 120 may be
   determined at least in part based on the flash gas bypass flow rate sensed by sensor
   195e.
20         As described above, controller 105 may be configured to provide instructions
   to one or more components of refrigeration system 100.          Controller 105 may be
   configured to provide instructions via any appropriate communications link (e.g.,
   wired or wireless) or analog control signal. As depicted in FIGURE 1, controller 105
   is configured to wirelessly communicate with components of refrigeration system
25 100. For example, in response to receiving an instruction from controller 105, parallel
   compressor 120 may begin operating. As another example, in response to receiving
   an instruction from controller 105, compressor 1 Oa may increase discharge pressure.
   An example of controller 105 is further described below with respect to FIGURE 4.
   In some embodiments, controller 105 includes or is a computer system.
30         In some embodiments, refrigeration system 100 includes one or more
   compressors 110.      Refrigeration system 100 may include any suitable number of
   compressors 110. For example, as depicted in FIGURE 1, refrigeration system 100
   includes two compressors 1 Oa-b. Compressors 110 may vary by design and/or by
   capacity. For example, some compressor designs may be more energy efficient than
                                               7

   other compressor designs and some compressors 110 may have modular capacity (i.e.,
   capability to vary capacity).     As described above, compressor 1 Oa may be a LT
   compressor that is configured to compress refrigerant discharged from a LT case (e.g.,
   LT case 160a) and compressor 11 Ob may be a MT compressor that is configured to
 5 compress refrigerant discharged from a MT case (e.g., MT case 160b).
           In some embodiments, refrigeration system 100 includes a parallel compressor
   120.     Parallel compressor     120 may be configured to provide supplemental
   compression to refrigerant circulating through refrigeration system 100. For example,
   parallel compressor 120 may be operable to compress flash gas discharged from flash
10 tank 150. As will be described in more detail below, parallel compressor 120 may
   also be operable to compress refrigerant discharged from LT compressor 110a. In
   some embodiments, discharging refrigerant from LT compressor 110a to parallel
   compressor 120 permits parallel compressor 120 to remain in operation for a longer
   duration than it would otherwise be able to if parallel compressor 120 only received
15 flash gas from flash tank 150.
           This disclosure recognizes that refrigeration system 100 may consume about
   3.4% less energy by permitting parallel compressor 120 to compress refrigerant
   discharged by LT compressor 1 10a rather than limiting parallel compressor 120 to
   only compressing flash gas discharged from flash tank 150. This is because parallel
20 compressors 120 are generally only operational when the flash gas flow is above a
   particular threshold (also referred to herein as "operation threshold").
           As an example, a parallel compressor 120 in the traditional configuration may
   be operational so long as the flash gas bypass flow rate is above 50% of the design
   flow rate. The flash gas bypass flow rate may be dependent on one or more of the
25 system load and/or the ambient temperature. As an example, in a transcritical system
   having a traditional configuration of parallel compressor 120, the parallel compressor
   may be configured to turn off when the ambient temperature is below a temperature
   threshold (e.g., 22'C) and/or when the ambient temperature is below a temperature
   threshold (e.g., 24'C) and the refrigeration load is below a load threshold (e.g., 80%).
30 As will be understood by those of skill in the art, the temperature threshold may be
   based on the load of the refrigeration system.
           This disclosure recognizes increasing the flow rate of refrigerant into parallel
   compressor 120 by directing refrigerant discharged from first compressor 1 10a to
   parallel compressor 120.     In other words, this disclosure recognizes supplementing
                                                8

   flash gas with refrigerant discharged from compressor 110a to increase the overall
   flow of refrigerant to parallel compressor 120.      By increasing the overall flow of
   refrigerant to parallel compressor 120, parallel compressor 120 may be able to remain
   in operation for a longer duration relative to a refrigeration system having a parallel
 5 compressor in the traditional configuration. As a result, the disclosed configuration
   recognizes that parallel compressor 120 may remain in operation even at reduced
   ambient temperatures or reduced system loads. In other words, parallel compressor
   120 in the disclosed configuration may operate at lower temperature and/or load
   thresholds than a parallel compressor 120 in the traditional configuration.          For
10 example, when the ambient temperature is 20'C and the refrigeration load is 80%
   (compared to the traditional configuration where the parallel compressor shuts off
   when the ambient temperature is below 24'C and the system load is 80%).
           As depicted in FIGURES 1 and 2, refrigeration system 100 may include one or
   more gas coolers 130 in some embodiments. Gas cooler 130 is configured to receive
15 compressed refrigerant vapor (e.g., from compressors 110, 120) and cool the received
   refrigerant.  In some embodiments, gas cooler 130 is a heat exchanger comprising
   cooler tubes configured to circulate the received refrigerant and coils through which
   ambient air is forced.    Inside gas cooler 130, the coils may absorb heat from the
   refrigerant, thereby providing cooling to the refrigerant.       In some embodiments,
20 refrigeration system 100 includes an expansion valve 140. Expansion valve 140 may
   be configured to reduce the pressure of refrigerant. For example, gas cooler 130 may
   discharge liquid refrigerant having a pressure of 120 bar to expansion valve 140, and
   the refrigerant may be discharged from expansion valve 140 having a pressure of 38
   bar. In some embodiments, this reduction in pressure causes some of the refrigerant
25 to vaporize.   As a result, mixed-state refrigerant (e.g., refrigerant vapor and liquid
   refrigerant) is discharged from expansion valve 140.        In some embodiments, this
   mixed-state refrigerant is discharged to flash tank 150.
           Refrigeration system 100 may include a flash tank 150 in some embodiments.
   Flash tank 150 may be configured to receive mixed-state refrigerant and separate the
30 received refrigerant into flash gas and liquid refrigerant.     Typically, the flash gas
   collects near the top of flash tank 150 and the liquid refrigerant is collected in the
   bottom of flash tank 150. In some embodiments, the liquid refrigerant flows from
   flash tank 150 and provides cooling to one or more evaporates (cases) 160 and the
                                                9

   flash gas flows to one or more compressors (e.g., compressor 110 and/or compressor
   120) for compression before being discharged to gas cooler 130 for cooling.
            Refrigeration system 100 may include one or more evaporators 160 in some
   embodiments. As depicted in FIGURES 1 and 2, refrigeration system 100 includes
 5 two evaporators 160 (LT case 160a and MT case 160b). As described above, LT case
   160a may be configured to receive liquid refrigerant of a first temperature and MT
   case 160b may be configured to receive liquid refrigerant of a second temperature,
   wherein the first temperature (-29'C) is lower in temperature than the second
   temperature (e.g., -7'C). As an example, a LT case 160a may be a freezer in a
10 grocery store and a MT case 160b may be a cooler in a grocery store.            In some
   embodiments, the liquid refrigerant leaving flash tank 150 is the same temperature
   and pressure (e.g., 4'C and 38 bar). Before reaching cases 160, the liquid refrigerant
   may be directed through one or more evaporator valves 170 (e.g., 170a and 170b of
   FIGURES 1 and 2). In some embodiments, each valve may be controlled (e.g., by
15 controller 105) to adjust the temperature and pressure of the liquid refrigerant. For
   example, valve 170a may be configured to discharge the liquid refrigerant at -29'C
   and 14 bar to LT case 160a and valve 170b may be configured to discharge the liquid
   refrigerant at -7'C and 30 bar to MT case 160b.            In some embodiments, each
   evaporator 160 is associated with a particular valve 170 and the valve 170 controls the
20 temperature and pressure of the liquid refrigerant that reaches the evaporator 160.
            System 100 may also include one or more compressor valves 180 in some
   embodiments. Compressor valves 180 may receive refrigerant discharged from first
   compressor 1 10a and may open and close to permit the received refrigerant to flow to
   either second compressor 1 Oa or parallel compressor 11 Ob. As depicted in FIGURE
25 1, compressor valve 180 is a three-way valve permitting refrigerant to be discharged
   from first compressor 1 Oa to either parallel compressor 120 or second compressor
   110b.     As depicted in FIGURE 2, compressor valves 180a-b are solenoid valves
   permitting refrigerant to be discharged from first compressor 110a to second
   compressor 11 Ob via compressor valve 180a or from first compressor 11 Oa to parallel
30 compressor 120 through compressor valve 180b.
            In some embodiments, controller 105 controls the opening and closing of
   compressor valve(s) 180.       The opening of compressor valve 180 may permit
   refrigerant to flow through valve 180 and the closing of compressor valve 180 may
   restrict refrigerant from flowing through valve 180. In some embodiments, controller
                                               10

   105 opens compressor valve 180 to permit flow through to parallel compressor 120
   when parallel compressor 120 is operational.           Parallel compressor 120 may be
   operational when the flow rate of refrigerant into parallel compressor 120 is above an
   operation threshold.     As described above, the flow rate may fluctuate based on
 5 changes in the ambient temperature of the environment of the refrigeration system
   100 and/or changes in the system load.            As is also described above, directing
   refrigerant from compressor 1 10a to parallel compressor 120 increases the flow rate
   which permits parallel compressor 120 to remain in operation when it would
   otherwise not be (e.g., when the flow rate from flash tank 150 falls below the
10 operation threshold due to the ambient temperature of the environment of the
   refrigeration system and/or the load of the refrigeration system).
           Controller 105 may close compressor valve 180 to restrict flow through to
   parallel compressor 120 when parallel compressor 120 is not operational. In certain
   embodiments,     parallel  compressor    120    is non-operational when the ambient
15 temperature is below a temperature threshold, the load is below a temperature
   threshold, and/or the flow rate of refrigerant into parallel compressor 120 falls below
   the operation threshold.    In some embodiments, if compressor valve 180 is closed
   such that refrigerant cannot flow to parallel compressor 120, the refrigerant is instead
   directed to second compressor 110a.
20         System 100 may also include a flash gas valve 190 in some embodiments.
   Flash gas valve 190 may be configured to open and close to permit or restrict the flow
   through of flash gas discharged from flash tank 150.             In some embodiments,
   controller 105 controls the opening and closing of flash gas valve 190. As depicted in
   FIGURES 1 and 2, closing flash gas valve 190 may restrict flash gas from flowing to
25 second compressor 1 10b (such that the flash gas flows to parallel compressor 120)
   and opening flash gas valve 190 may permit flow of flash gas to second compressor
   1 10b.   As an example, controller 105 may close flash gas valve 190 when it
   determines to operate parallel compressor 120 and open flash gas valve 190 when it
   determines not to operate parallel compressor 120. As described above, determining
30 to operate parallel compressor 120 may be based on a flow rate which may be
   increased by directing refrigerant from compressor 1 Oa to parallel compressor 120.
           This disclosure recognizes that refrigeration system 100 may comprise one or
   more other components. As an example, refrigeration system 100 may comprise one
   or more desuperheaters in some embodiments.          One or ordinary skill in the art will
                                                11

   appreciate that refrigeration system 100 may include other components not mentioned
   herein.
           As described above, the disclosed configuration differs from a traditional
   configuration of a refrigeration system 100 with a parallel compressor 120 because it
 5 permits refrigerant discharged from first compressor 110a to be directed to parallel
   compressor 120.      Refrigerant may be discharged from first compressor 110a to
   parallel compressor 120 when parallel compressor 120 is operational and may be
   discharged from first compressor 110a to second compressor 110b when parallel
   compressor 120 is not operational. This is in contrast to the traditional configuration
10 wherein refrigerant discharged from first compressor 110a is directed to second
   compressor 1 Ob. A similarity between the disclosed and the traditional configuration
   is that flash gas discharged from flash tank 150 is directed to either second
   compressor 110b or parallel compressor 120 based on whether parallel compressor
   120 is operational.
15         In operation, controller 105 may determine whether parallel compressor 120 is
   operational.   As described above, controller 105 operates parallel compressor 120
   when the flow rate of refrigerant to the compressor is above an operation threshold
   and does not operate parallel compressor 120 when the flow rate is below the
   operation threshold (e.g., about 50% of design flow rate). The flow rate may fluctuate
20 based on the ambient temperature of the environment of refrigeration system 100
   and/or the load of refrigeration system 100. Thus, in some embodiments, controller
   105 receives information about the flow rate from one or more sensors 195 (e.g.,
   sensor 195e of flash tank 150) and, based on the received information, determines
   whether to operate parallel compressor 120.
25         If controller 105 determines to operate parallel compressor 120, controller 105
   may direct refrigerant that is discharged from first compressor 110a to parallel
   compressor 120 for further compression. If controller 105 instead determines not to
   operate parallel compressor 120, controller 105 may direct refrigerant that is
   discharged from compressor 11 Oa to first compressor 11 Ob for further compression.
30 In some embodiments, controller 105 directs refrigerant discharged from first
   compressor 110 to either parallel compressor 120 or second compressor 11 Ob by
   opening and closing valve 180. As described above, valve 180 may be a three-way
   valve (e.g., valve 180 of FIGURE 1) in some embodiments. In other embodiments,
   system 100 includes two solenoid valves (e.g., valve 180a and 180b of FIGURE 2).
                                              12

            Controller 105 may also be configured to control the discharge pressure of
   refrigerant being compressed in compressor 110a.       For example, if controller 105
   determines to operate parallel compressor 120, controller 105 may control the
   discharge pressure of compressor 11 Oa to substantially match the discharge pressure
 5 of flash gas leaving flash tank 150 (e.g., 38 bar). As another example, if controller
   105 determines not to operate parallel compressor 120, controller 105 may control the
   discharge pressure of compressor 11 Oa to substantially match the discharge pressure
   of flash gas leaving MT case 160b (e.g., 30 bar).
            In addition to opening and closing compressor valve(s) 180 to permit or
10 restrict flow to parallel compressor 120 from first compressor 1 Oa, controller 105
   may open and close flash gas valve 190 to permit or restrict flash gas flow to parallel
   compressor 120.      In some embodiments, upon determining to operate parallel
   compressor 120, controller 105 opens compressor valve 180 to permit refrigerant to
   be discharged from first compressor 1 Oa to parallel compressor 120 and closes flash
15 gas valve 190 to prevent flash gas from flowing to second compressor 110b. As a
   result, the refrigerant discharged from first compressor 110a and the flash gas
   discharged from flash tank 150 are directed to parallel compressor 120 for
   compression.     Thus, second compressor 110b may, in some embodiments, only
   compress refrigerant discharged from MT case 170b (rather than compressing
20 refrigerant discharged from one or more of LT case 170a and flash tank 150 in
   addition to MT case 170b). This disclosure recognizes that refrigeration system 100
   may keep parallel      compressor   in operation    longer, relative to a traditional
   configuration, by permitting parallel compressor 120 to compress both flash gas
   discharged from flash tank 150 and refrigerant discharged from first compressor 1 Oa.
25          In some embodiments, refrigerant from first compressor 110a is discharged
   directly to parallel compressor 120.    In other embodiments, refrigerant from first
   compressor 1 10a is discharged indirectly to parallel compressor 120. As used herein,
   refrigerant is discharged "directly" to parallel compressor 120 when the refrigerant
   does not flow through other components (with the exception of compressor valve(s)
30 180) of refrigeration system 100. For example, as depicted in FIGURE 1, refrigerant
   is discharged directly from first compressor 110a to parallel compressor 120.        In
   contrast, as depicted in FIGURE 2, refrigerant is discharged indirectly from first
   compressor 110a to parallel compressor 120. FIGURE 2 illustrates that refrigerant
                                              13

   may be discharged from first compressor 1 Oa to flash tank 150, which in turn is
   discharged as flash gas from flash tank 150 to parallel compressor 120.
           As described above, FIGURE 3 illustrates a method 300 of a refrigeration
   system 100.      In some embodiments, the method 300 may be implemented by
 5 controller 105 of refrigeration system 100. Method 300 may be stored on a computer
   readable medium, such as a memory of controller 105 (e.g., memory 420 of FIGURE
   4), as a series of operating instructions that direct the operation of a processor (e.g.,
   processor 430 of FIGURE 4). Method 300 may be associated with efficiency benefits
   such as reduced power consumption relative to refrigeration systems that operate a
10 parallel compressor in a traditional configuration. In some embodiments, the method
   300 begins in step 305 and continues to decision step 310.
           At step 310, controller 105 determines whether a parallel compressor 120 of
   refrigeration system 100 is operational. In some embodiments, parallel compressor
   120 is operational when a flow rate of refrigerant to parallel compressor 120 is greater
15 than an operation threshold and is not operational when the flow rate is less than the
   operation threshold (e.g., about 50% of the design flow rate).         The flow rate of
   refrigerant to parallel compressor 120 may refer to the present flow rate (e.g., if
   parallel compressor 120 is already operational) or the flow rate available to parallel
   compressor 120. For example, if parallel compressor 120 has been non-operational,
20 the flow rate available from flash tank 150 and first compressor 110a may be
   sufficient to exceed the operation threshold and therefore to transition parallel
   compressor 120 from non-operational to operational.        The flow rate may fluctuate
   based on an ambient temperature of the environment surrounding the refrigeration
   system and/or a load of the refrigeration system. For example, parallel compressor
25 120 may be operational as long as a temperature threshold (e.g., 15'C) is met. As
   another example, parallel compressor 120 may be operational as long as a load
   threshold (e.g., 80%) is met.
           If at step 310, controller 105 determines that parallel compressor 120 is
   operational (e.g., the present flow rate or available flow rate of refrigerant to parallel
30 compressor 120 is greater than the operation threshold, the ambient temperature is
   greater than the temperature threshold, and/or the load is greater than a load
   threshold), the method 300 may proceed to step 320a. In contrast, if controller 105
   determines that parallel compressor 120 is not operational at step 310, the method 300
   proceeds to step 320b.
                                               14

           At step 320a, controller      105 directs refrigerant discharged from first
   compressor 1 10a to parallel compressor 120. In some embodiments, controller 105
   directs refrigerant discharged from first compressor 1 10a to parallel compressor 120
   by opening and closing one or more compressor valve(s) 180.            For example, as
 5 depicted in FIGURE 1, controller 105 may open three-way compressor valve 180 to
   permit the refrigerant from first compressor 110a to be discharged to parallel
   compressor 120. As another example, as depicted in FIGURE 2, controller 105 may
   close compressor valve 180a and open compressor valve 180b to permit the
   refrigerant from first compressor 1 10a to be discharged to parallel compressor 120. In
10 some embodiments (e.g., FIGURE 1), refrigerant from first compressor 110a is
   discharged directly to parallel compressor 120. In other embodiments (e.g., FIGURE
   2), refrigerant from      first compressor 110a is discharged indirectly to parallel
   compressor 120 (e.g., discharged from first compressor 110a to flash tank 150 and
   discharged from flash tank 150 to parallel compressor 120).
15         In some embodiments, directing the refrigerant from first compressor 1 Oa to
   parallel compressor 120 increases the flow rate of refrigerant into parallel compressor
   120, thereby permitting parallel compressor 120 to remain in operation for a longer
   duration relative to a refrigeration system 100 in the traditional configuration (e.g.,
   wherein refrigerant from compressor 11 Oa is not directed from compressor 11 Oa to
20 parallel compressor 120).       In some embodiments, the refrigerant directed from
   compressor 1 10a to parallel compressor 120 has a discharge pressure that is
   substantially the same as the suction pressure of the parallel compressor.
           If at decision step 310 controller 105 determines that parallel compressor 120
   is not operational, the method 300 proceeds to step 320b. At step 320b, controller 105
25 directs the refrigerant discharged from first compressor 110a to second compressor
   11 Ob.   Controller 105 may direct the refrigerant discharged from first compressor
   1 Oa by opening or closing one or more compressor valves 180. As an example, as
   depicted in FIGURE 1, controller 105 may direct the refrigerant discharged from the
   first compressor 110a by opening three-way compressor valve 180 to permit the flow
30 of refrigerant from first compressor 110a to second compressor 110b and closing
   three-way compressor valve 180 to restrict the flow of refrigerant from compressor
   110a to parallel compressor 120.     As another example, as depicted in FIGURE 2,
   controller 105 may direct the refrigerant discharged from first compressor 110a by
   opening compressor valve 180a to permit the flow of refrigerant from first compressor
                                               15

   110a to second compressor 110b and closing compressor valve 180b to restrict the
   indirect flow of refrigerant from the first compressor 110a to parallel compressor 120
   via flash tank 150. In some embodiments, the refrigerant directed from compressor
   11 Oa to second compressor 11 Ob has a discharge pressure that is substantially the
 5 same as the suction pressure of second compressor 11 Ob.
           In some embodiments, after controller 105 directs the refrigerant from first
   compressor 1 10a to either parallel compressor 120 or second compressor 1 Ob, the
   method 300 continues to an end step 325.
           FIGURE 4 illustrates an example controller 105 of refrigeration system 100,
10 according to certain embodiments of the present disclosure.       Controller 105 may
   comprise one or more interfaces 410, memory 420, and one or more processors 430.
   Interface 410 receives input (e.g., sensor data or system data), sends output (e.g.,
   instructions), processes the input and/or output, and/or performs other suitable
   operation. Interface 410 may comprise hardware and/or software. As an example,
15 interface 410 receives information about the ambient temperature of refrigeration
   system 100 and/or information about the load of the refrigeration system 100 from
   sensors 195.     Controller 105 may compare the received temperature and load
   information to temperature and load thresholds to determine whether to operate
   parallel compressor 120. As described above, the flow rate of refrigerant to parallel
20 compressor 120 is above an operation threshold when the temperature and/or load
   thresholds are met.
           In some embodiments, if controller 105 determines that one or more of the
   temperature and load thresholds are met, controller 105 sends instructions to parallel
   compressor 120 to begin operating.       Controller 105 may also send instructions to
25 valves 180, 190 to open or close to permit the refrigerant from first compressor 11 Oa
   and flash gas from flash tank 150 to be discharged to parallel compressor 120. For
   example, controller 105 may direct compressor valve 180 to open such that refrigerant
   from first compressor 1 10a is discharged to parallel compressor 120 for compression.
   As another example, controller 105 may direct flash gas valve 190 to close such that
30 flash gas discharged from flash tank 150 is discharged to parallel compressor 120 for
   compression. Alternatively, if controller 105 determines that the one or more of the
   temperature and load thresholds are not met (based on a comparison of information
   from sensors 195), controller 105 may send instructions to parallel compressor 120 to
   terminate operation. Controller may also send instructions to valves 180, 190 to open
                                                16

   or close such that the refrigerant discharged from first compressor 110a and flash gas
   discharged from flash tank 150 is directed to second compressor 10b.
           Processor 430 may include any suitable combination of hardware and software
   implemented in one or more modules to execute instructions and manipulate data to
 5 perform some or all of the described functions of controller 105.              In some
   embodiments, processor 430 may include, for example, one or more computers, one
   or more central processing units (CPUs), one or more microprocessors, one or more
   applications, one or more application specific integrated circuits (ASICs), one or more
   field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), and/or other logic.
10         Memory (or memory unit) 420 stores information. As an example, memory
   420 may store one or more of a temperature threshold, a load threshold, and an
   operation threshold.     Controller 105 may use these stored thresholds to determine
   whether to operate parallel compressor 120. As another example, memory 420 may
   store the method 300.       Memory 420 may comprise one or more non-transitory,
15 tangible, computer-readable, and/or computer-executable storage media. Examples of
   memory 420 include computer memory (for example, Random Access Memory
   (RAM) or Read Only Memory (ROM)), mass storage media (for example, a hard
   disk), removable storage media (for example, a Compact Disk (CD) or a Digital
   Video Disk (DVD)), database and/or network storage (for example, a server), and/or
20 other computer-readable medium.
           Embodiments of the present disclosure may have one or more technical
   advantages.    In certain embodiments, refrigeration system 100 permits refrigerant to
   be discharged from first compressor 1 10a to parallel compressor 120.        Permitting
   refrigerant to be discharged from first compressor 110 to parallel compressor 120 may
25 allow parallel compressor 120 to remain in operation longer than a refrigeration
   system with parallel compressors 120 in the traditional configuration (e.g., wherein
   the first compressor 110a is not configured to discharge refrigerant to parallel
   compressor 120). This may be due to the increase in the flow rate of refrigerant into
   parallel compressor 120 caused by supplementing the flash gas bypass flow rate from
30 flash tank 150 with refrigerant discharged from first compressor 1 Oa.
           Increasing the flow rate permits parallel compressor 120 to remain in
   operation for a longer period of time than a refrigeration system having a parallel
   compressor in the traditional configuration.     As an example, one embodiment of
   refrigeration system 100 having a MT load of 50kW and a LT load of 20kW may
                                               17

   achieve an annual energy savings of about 3.4% by implementing the disclosed
   configuration rather than the traditional configuration in the refrigeration system.   In
   such an embodiment, a parallel compressor in the disclosed configuration may permit
   the parallel compressor to operate when the load is 80% and/or when the ambient
 5 temperature of the refrigeration system is above 20'C. This is compared to a parallel
   compressor in the traditional configuration which permits the parallel compressor to
   operate when the load is 80% and the ambient temperature of the refrigeration system
   is above 24'C and/or when the ambient temperature of the refrigeration system is
   above 22'C. Thus, the disclosed configuration permits the parallel compressor to
10 operate at loads and/or ambient temperatures that the traditional configuration cannot
   operate at.
            Modifications,  additions, or omissions may be made to the systems,
   apparatuses, and methods described herein without departing from the scope of the
   disclosure.   The components of the systems and apparatuses may be integrated or
15 separated.     Moreover, the operations of the systems and apparatuses may be
   performed by more, fewer, or other components. For example, refrigeration system
   100 may include any suitable number of compressors, condensers, condenser fans,
