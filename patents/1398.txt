ABSTRACT
             A garage door opener remote control device performs secondary functions (other than
opening and closing a garage door). The garage door opener remote control device includes a
user input, a wireless communication interface to communicate with a garage door opener,
and secondary components including sensory and actuatable components.              A processor
communicates a user input to the garage door opener to operate a motor configured to drive a
garage door. The processor also detects stimuli in a space associated with the remote control
device based on sensory data from the secondary sensor, determines a responsive action, and
controls the secondary actuatable component or an accessory device of the garage door opener
to perform the responsive action. The remote control device may function as a speaker phone
or wireless communication device utilizing the secondary components.             The secondary
components may be connected to vehicle diagnostics and communicate vehicle status to users.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[00171                      Before any embodiments of the invention are explained in detail, it is to be
understood that the invention is not limited in its application to the details of construction and
the arrangement of components set forth in the following description or illustrated in the
following drawings. The invention is capable of other embodiments and of being practiced or
of being carried out in various ways. Also, it is to be understood that the phraseology and
terminology used herein is for the purpose of description and should not be regarded as
limiting.
                                                              3

[00181                      FIGS. 1-2 illustrate a garage door system 50 including a garage door opener
100 operatively coupled to a garage door 104. The garage door opener 100 includes a
housing 108 supporting a motor that is operatively coupled to a drive mechanism 116. The
drive mechanism 116 includes a transmission coupling the motor to a drive chain 120 having
a shuttle 124 configured to be displaced along a rail assembly 128 upon actuation of the
motor. The shuttle 124 may be selectively coupled to a trolley 132 that is slidable along the
rail assembly 128 and coupled to the garage door 104 via an arm member.
[0019]                      The trolley 132 is releaseably coupled to the shuttle 124 such that the garage
door system 50 is operable in a powered mode and a manual mode. In the powered mode, the
trolley 132 is coupled to the shuttle 124 and the motor is selectively driven in response to
actuation by a user (e.g., via a key pad or wireless remote in communication with the garage
door opener 100). As the motor is driven, the drive chain 120 is driven by the motor along
the rail assembly 128 to displace the shuttle 124 (and, therefore, the trolley 132), thereby
opening or closing the garage door 104. In the manual mode, the trolley 132 is decoupled
from the shuttle 124 such that a user may manually operate the garage door 104 to open or
close without resistance from the motor. The trolley 132 may be decoupled, for example,
when a user applies a force to a release cord 136 to disengage the trolley 132 from the shuttle
124. In some embodiments, other drive systems are included such that, for example, the drive
mechanism 116 includes a transmission coupling the motor to a drive belt that is operatively
coupled to the garage door 104 via a rail and carriage assembly.
[0020]                      The housing 108 is coupled to the rail assembly 128 and a surface above the
garage door (e.g., a garage ceiling or support beam) by, for example, a support bracket 148.
The garage door opener further includes a light unit 152 including a light (e.g., one or more
light emitting diodes (LEDs)) enclosed by a transparent cover or lens 156), which provides
light to the garage. The light unit 152 may either be selectively actuated by a user or
automatically powered upon actuation of the garage door opener 100. In one example, the
light unit 152 may be configured to remain powered for a predetermined amount of time after
actuation of the garage door opener 100.
[0021]                      The garage door opener 100 further includes an antenna 158 enabling the
garage door opener 100 to communicate wirelessly with other devices, such as a smart phone
                                                            4
9743041_1 (GHMatters) P107423.AU

or network device (e.g., a router, hub, or modem), as described in further detail below. The
garage door opener 100 is also configured to receive, control, and/or monitor a variety of
accessory devices, such as a backup battery unit 190, a speaker 192, a fan 194, an extension
cord reel 196, among others.
[0022]                      FIGS. 3A-B illustrates a block power diagram of the garage door opener 100.
The garage door opener 100 includes a terminal block 202 configured to receive power from
an external power source 204, such as a standard 120 VAC power outlet. The terminal block
202 directs power, via a transformer 208, to a garage door opener (GDO) board 210 for
supply to components thereof as well as a motor 212 (used to drive the drive mechanism 116,
as described above), LEDs 214 (of the light unit 152), and garage door sensors 216. The
terminal block 202 further directs power via the transformer 208 to a wireless board 220 and
components thereof, as well as a wired keypad 222 and module ports 223. The terminal block
202 also directs power to a battery charger 224 and AC ports 228. The module ports 223 are
configured to receive various accessory devices, such as a speaker, a fan, an extension cord
reel, a parking assist laser, an environmental sensor, a flashlight, and a security camera. One
or more of the accessory devices are selectively attachable to and removable from the garage
door opener 100, and may be monitored and controlled by the garage door opener 100.
[0023]                      The wireless board 220 includes a wireless microcontroller 240, among other
components. The GDO board 210 includes, among other components, a garage door opener
(GDO) microcontroller 244 and a radio frequency (RF) transceiver 246.
[0024]                      FIG. 4 illustrates a block communication diagram of the garage door opener
100. The wireless microcontroller 240 is coupled to the antenna 158 and enables wireless
communication with a server 250 via a network device 252 and network 254, as well as with a
smart phone 256 (and other similar external devices, such as tablets and laptops). The
network device 252 may be, for example, one or more of a router, hub, or modem. The
network 254 may be, for example, the Internet, a local area network (LAN), another wide area
network (WAN) or a combination thereof. The wireless microcontroller 240 may include, for
example, a Wi-Fi radio including hardware, software, or a combination thereof enabling
wireless communications according to the Wi-Fi protocol. In other embodiments, the
wireless microcontroller 240 is configured to communicate with the server 250 via the
                                                            5
9743041_1 (GHMatters) P107423.AU

network device 252 and network 254 using other wireless communication protocols. The
network 254 may include various wired and wireless connections to communicatively couple
the garage door opener 100 to the server 250. As illustrated, the wireless microcontroller 240
also includes wired communication capabilities for communicating with the GDO
microcontroller 244 via the multiplexor 260. In some embodiments, the wireless
microcontroller 240 and the GDO microcontroller 244 are directly coupled for
communication. In some embodiments, the wireless microcontroller 240 and the GDO
microcontroller 244 are combined into a single controller.
[0025]                      The RF transceiver 246 is wirelessly coupled to various user actuation devices,
including one or more wireless remotes 262 and wireless keypads 264, to receive and provide
to the GDO microcontroller 244 user actuation commands (e.g., to open and close the garage
door 104). The smart phone 256 may also receive user input and, in response, provide
(directly or via the network 254) to the wireless microcontroller 240 user actuation commands
for the garage door opener 100 or commands to control one or more of the accessory devices.
The multiplexor 260 enables communication between and among the wireless microcontroller
240, the GDO microcontroller 244, and the accessory microcontrollers 266 (of the accessory
devices previously noted).
[0026]                      FIG. 5 illustrates a diagram of a garage door control system 300. The garage
door control system 300 includes the garage door opener 100, server 250, network 254 and a
garage door opener (GDO) remote control 302. For ease of illustration and description, the
network device 252 is considered part of the network 254 in FIG. 5 and not separately
illustrated. Also, not shown in FIG. 5 is the smart phone 256 (or other external device) that
communicates with the garage door opener 100 via the network 254.
[00271                      The server 250 includes a server memory 305, a server processor (e.g., an
electronic server processor) 310, and a network communication interface 315 coupled by a
communication bus 320.
[0028]                      The garage door opener 100 includes a wireless controller 330. Only select
components of the wireless controller 330 are illustrated, including a wireless transceiver 345,
a processor (e.g., an electronic processor) 350, a memory 355, and the radio frequency (RF)
transceiver 246. The wireless transceiver 345 may be part of the wireless microcontroller 240
                                                             6
9743041_1 (GHMatters) P107423.AU

(FIG. 4). The processor 350 and memory 355 may be part of the GDO microcontroller 244
(FIG. 4). The processor 350, memory 355, RF transceiver 246 and wireless transceiver 345
are in communication via a communication bus 365, which may include the multiplexor 260
(FIG. 4).
[0029]                      The GDO remote control 302 includes a remote control processor (herein
remote processor) 370, a remote control memory (herein remote memory) 375, a remote
control RF transceiver (herein remote RF transceiver) 380, an input button 382, and one or
more secondary components 385 coupled by a communication bus 390. The GDO remote
control 302 further includes a power supply 395. The power supply 395 provides power to
the components of the GDO remote control 302, for example, based on solar power, 12V
connection to car battery, one-use batteries, rechargeable batteries, or power tool battery pack
(e.g., 18V Lithium Ion).
[0030]                      In some embodiments, the GDO remote control 302 is positioned within a
vehicle (e.g., the vehicle illustrated in FIG. 1). For example, the GDO remote control 302
may include a housing with a clip configured to attach to a sun visor of the vehicle or with
hardware to mount to a dash of the vehicle.
[00311                      The GDO remote control 302 is an example of the wireless remote 262 (FIG.
4) noted above and, accordingly, is configured to transmit user actuation commands to the RF
transceiver 246 of the garage door opener 100 (e.g., to open and close the garage door 104).
For example, the remote processor 370 may receive from the input button 382, which may be
a hard key (e.g., pushbutton switch) or soft key (e.g., on a graphical user interface presented
on a display of the GDO remote control 302), an indication of a user actuation of the input
button 382. In turn, the remote processor 370 may transmit a user actuation command via the
remote RF transceiver 380 to the RF transceiver 246 of the garage door opener 100. The user
actuation command may include a fixed or rolling code, which the processor 350 of the
garage door opener 100 compares to an expected one or more codes to confirm the
authenticity of the command. In response to confirmation, the garage door opener 100 drives
motor 212 to open or close the garage door.
[0032]                      FIG. 6 illustrates the GDO remote control 302 in further detail and, in
particular, with example elements making up the one or more secondary components 385.
                                                           7
9743041_1 (GHMatters) P107423.AU

The one or more secondary components 385 may include one or more of a light 405, a
speaker 410, a laser 415, a camera 420, a microphone 425, a cabin environment sensor 430
(e.g., one or more of an oxygen sensor, carbon monoxide sensor, temperature sensor,
humidity sensor, and ultraviolet (UV) sensor), an occupancy sensor 435, a proximity sensor
440, an accelerometer 445, a breathalyzer 450, a burglar sensor 455, a doze sensor 460, a
parking sensor 465, a cruise card transceiver 470, an OBD connector 475, a wireless radio
480 (e.g., one or more of a Wi-FiTM radio, BluetoothTM radio, ZigbeeTM, a cellular radio, or
another wireless radio), or a global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receiver 485. While
these elements are described in the singular, one or more may be present in embodiments of
the GDO remote control 302 (e.g., two or more microphones), which may work together or
independently for various functions. Similarly, in some embodiments of the GDO remote
control 302, one or more of the secondary components 385 illustrated in FIG. 6 are not
included in the GDO remote control 302.
[0033]                      The remote processor 370 is communicatively coupled via the communication
bus 390 to the secondary components 385 to receive data from the secondary components
385, to control the secondary component 385, or both. The remote processor 370 may further
communicate (e.g., via the remote RF transceiver 380 or the wireless radio 480) with the
garage door opener 100, the smart phone 256, and/or the server 250 to implement various
functions described below. The GDO remote control 302 is configured to perform one or
more secondary functions using one or more of the secondary components 385. For example,
a secondary function is a function other than, or in addition to, instructing the garage door
opener 100 to open or close. Some embodiments with secondary functions include the
following examples.
[0034]                      The microphone 425 may be utilized for implementing voice commands for
the GDO remote control 302. In one embodiment, the microphone 425 is employed to detect
audio and convey audio signals to the remote processor 370. The remote processor 370
analyzes the audio signals to detect commands from a user. For example, the remote
processor 370 is configured to identify a voice command by comparing received audio signals
to stored audio commands and, based on the comparison, determine a matching stored audio
command. The remote processor 370 then takes steps to carry out the identified voice
command, such as sending instructions to the garage door opener 100. In these examples, the
                                                          8
9743041_1 (GHMatters) P107423.AU

processor 350 is configured to receive and execute instructions transmitted by the remote
processor 370 in response to identified voice commands. As such, the microphone 425 is
employed to implement voice commands to open and close the garage door 104. In some
embodiments, the microphone 425 may be employed to implement voice commands for
turning garage door modules on or off. The modules may be accessories attached to the
garage door opener 100 at one of the module ports 223. The modules may include, for
example, a speaker, a fan, an extension cord reel, a parking assist laser, an environmental
sensor, a flashlight, and a security camera. To turn a module on or off, the processor 350 is
configured to, for example, control an electronic switch coupled between a power supply
(e.g., the transformer 208) and the module to enable and disable the flow of power.
[0035]                      In some embodiments, the microphone 425 may be utilized for implementing
voice commands for turning lights on or off. For example, voice commands may be received
via the microphone 425 for turning light 405 or a light on the garage door opener 100 on or
off, and corresponding instructions may be transmitted to the processor 350 to identify and
control the applicable light similar to those described above.
[0036]                      In some embodiments, the microphone 425 may be employed to implement
voice commands to set up time-based reminders (e.g., the reminders may be stored in the
remote memory 375). The remote processor 370 compares a current time to the stored
reminders to determine whether to convey the reminder. When the time for a particular
reminder is reached, the remote processor 370 conveys the time-based reminder via the
speaker 410 (e.g., "today is your wife's birthday).
[00371                      In some embodiments, the speaker 410 is employed to indicate information to
a user. For example, the speaker 410 may be employed to indicate driving directions (e.g.,
"left, right, stop") when a user is parking a vehicle in the garage. The driving directions may
be based on input from the parking sensor 465.
[0038]                      In some embodiments, the speaker 410 may be employed to indicate warnings
such as "stop moving, the door is open," "check tire pressure," and "turn off active modules."
In this regard, the speaker 410 may be activated by the remote processor 370 based on input
from other components of the secondary components 385 and/or the garage door opener
100.
                                                         9
9743041_1 (GHMatters) P107423.AU

[00391                      In some embodiments, the speaker 410 may be employed to indicate traffic
alerts. The traffic alerts may be received by the remote processor 370 via a connection to a
third party server application, for example, Google@ traffic or Waze@ traffic maps. The
connection to the third party server application may occur via the wireless radio 480. The
traffic alerts may alert a user when there is new traffic on the user's "normal" or current travel
route, while the user is using navigational services. The navigational services may be
accessed by the GDO remote control 302 via software and databases incorporated into the
GDO remote control 302, or may be accessible by the GDO remote control 302 via a network.
For example, the navigational services may reside on or be accessible via the server 250 or
smart phone 256.
[0040]                      In some embodiments, the occupancy sensor 435 may comprise a passive
infrared sensor (PIR) and/or ultrasonic sensors for detecting whether a child or animal has
been left in a car. The PIR may also detect when a child is playing and is stuck in a car. For
example, the PIR and ultrasonic sensors may output a binary signal indicative of whether
motion is detected. Output from the PIR and/or ultrasonic sensor may be received by the
remote processor 370, and the remote processor 370 may communicate a notification to a user
via wireless communication. For example, the notification may be sent via the remote RF
transceiver 380 or the wireless radio 480. The notification may be sent via the garage door
opener 100 or sent directly to the smart phone 256, the server 250, or a home network to
communicate the notification to a user.
[0041]                      In some embodiments, the occupancy sensor 435 may be utilized to turn on the
microphone 425, for example, on a schedule, or when the car doors close. When the
microphone is on and it detects noise above a threshold, the remote processor 370 can alert
the garage door opener 100 to send a notification to the user, for example, via the smart phone
256.
[0042]                       In some embodiments, the GDO remote control 302 may utilize output from
the proximity sensor 440 to trigger the remote processor 370 when it gets close to home, to
transmit a command to the garage door opener 100 to open the garage door. The GDO
remote control 302 determines the current state of the garage door (e.g., based on
                                                         10

communication sent via the RF transceiver 246 that indicates the garage door and open or
closed) and opens the door if it is in a closed position
[0043]                       In some embodiments, the remote processor 370 of the GDO remote control
302 is triggered based on proximity sensor 440 output when it detects that it is beyond a
predetermined proximity relative to home, to transmit a command to close to the garage door
with the garage door opener 100. The GDO remote control 302 determines the current state
of the garage door (e.g., based on communication from the RF transceiver 246) and closes the
garage door if it is in the open position.
[0044]                      In some embodiments, by employing the proximity sensor 440, the GDO
remote control 302 can determine when there is another car located in a garage already.
Alternatively, the GDO remote control 302 can determine that another car is located in a
garage based on communication received from the RF transceiver 246 of the garage door
opener 100, when the garage door opener 100 detects the other car utilizing sensors on the
garage door opener 100. The remote processor 370 may notify a user that the other car is
detected and may notify the user via the speaker 410.
[0045]                      In some embodiments, the accelerometer 445 may be employed by the GDO
remote control 302 to determine if a car in which the GDO remote control 302 is located is
moving. The remote processor 370 may notify a user that the car is moving via wireless
communication. For example, the notification may be sent via the remote RF transceiver 380
or the wireless radio 480. The notification may be sent via the garage door opener 100 or sent
directly to the smart phone 256, the server 250, or a home network to communicate the
notification to a user. Alternatively, the remote processor 370 may communicate the
notification via the speaker 410 to alert a person within the vehicle.
[0046]                      In some embodiments, the accelerometer 445 may be employed by the GDO
remote control 302 to detect speeds and movement of the car in which the GDO remote
control 302 is located. The remote processor 370 may notify a user that the car is moving or
may communicate the speed of the cars movement via the speaker 410 when the user is in the
vehicle, or via wireless communication to a remote user. For example, the movement and/or
speed notification may be sent via the remote RF transceiver 380 or the wireless radio 480.
                                                         11
9743041_1 (GHMatters) P107423.AU

The notification may be sent via the garage door opener 100 or sent directly to the smart
phone 256, the server 250, or a home network to communicate the notification to a user.
[00471                      In some embodiments, the accelerometer 445 may be employed by the GDO
remote control 302 to log data as the car is in use or on the road. Once the GDO remote
control 302 is located within wireless range of the GDO 100 or a communication network, the
data may be uploaded to the cloud (for example, to computing resources accessible via the
Internet), through, for example, a user's home network, or through the garage door opener
100 and the network 254.
[00481                      In some embodiments, based on output of the accelerometer 445, the GDO
remote control 302 is operable to send alerts, such as, "your vehicle has left the garage." In
this regard, the GDO remote control 302 communicates to the GDO 100 when motion of the
vehicle is detected after having previously determined a parked condition. The garage door
opener 100 may then send a notification to the user's smart phone 256 via the network 254.
[0049]                      In some embodiments the parking sensor 465, which may be a proximity
sensor, may be employed in a secondary function to provide parking directions to a driver via
the speaker 410. For example, the proximity sensor 465 can detect external markings placed
on the ground indicating a predetermined parking position in the garage (e.g., via optical
detection or other wireless detection). Alternatively the proximity sensor 465 may include
external sensors (e.g., infrared distance sensors) on the vehicle that detect proximity to objects
(e.g., walls, other items in a garage).
[0050]                      One or more environmental sensors 430 may be employed for performing
secondary functions. Environmental sensors 430 may include, for example, oxygen sensors,
carbon monoxide sensors, temperature sensors, humidity sensors and UV sensors. In some
embodiments, an oxygen sensor measures the quality of air in a car to see if a user should
change out a cabin air filter. The output of the oxygen sensor may be utilized to convey a
quality of air indication via speaker 410. Similarly, output from a carbon monoxide sensor
may be utilized to alert a user, via speaker 410, when an excessive CO level is detected. In
some embodiments, temperature sensors, humidity sensors, and/or UV sensors are utilized to
alert users, via speaker 410, when levels are detected outside of a normal range.

[0051]                      In some embodiments, the video camera 420 may record video in and/or
outside of the vehicle cabin, store the video in memory for later retrieval and/or export to the
smart phone 256 via the garage door opener 100.
[0052]                      In some embodiments, the auxiliary light 405 may be utilized to provide
ambient light, for example, to search for items in a vehicle. The auxiliary light 405 may also
be utilized as a flash of light, for example, for signaling reminders or notifications to a user.
[0053]                      In some embodiments, the wireless radio 480 may provide a local wireless
connection (e.g., Bluetooth) to connect to the GDO remote control 302 to the phone 256. In
one example, GDO remote control 302 may be utilized as a speaker phone for the phone 256,
using the microphone 425 and the speaker 410. (communication device)
[0054]                      In some embodiments the wireless radio 480 comprises a cellular radio and is
utilized to provide cellular communications for the GDO remote control 302 to enable the
GDO remote control 302 to connect to the network 254, the server 250, and/or the garage
door opener 100, for example, when the GDO remote control 302 is on the road, without
having to go through the smart phone 256 (or other bridge connections).
[0055]                      In some embodiments the wireless radio 480 comprises a Wi-Fi transceiver to
provide Wi-Fi connections that enable the GDO remote control 302 to connect directly to a
home network.
[00561                       In some embodiments, the GDO remote control 302 provides the wireless
radio 480 and an antenna for Zigbee, Z-wave, or other public or proprietary wireless
communication protocol-based communications to connect, control, or monitor the status of
other Home Connected products.
[00571                      In some embodiments, the remote processor 370 employ the GNSS receiver
485 for pinpoint tracking the location of the GDO remote control 302, which may also locate
the vehicle in which the GDO remote control 302 is located.
[00581                      In some embodiments, the remote processor 370 may employ the laser 415 to
project messages onto a target area, such as a wall, upon entering the garage. For example,
the laser 415 may project messages to display signals of warning, such as an oil low warning
                                                         13
9743041_1 (GHMatters) P107423.AU

based on oil level status detected via a connection to the vehicle. Parking assistance messages
may also be projected by the laser 415, for example, "3 ft," "2 ft," "1 ft," "stop."
[0059]                      In some embodiments, the remote processor 370 may employ the burglar
sensor 455, which may be tied into a vehicle alarm system, to inform the remote processor
370 when a break-in is detected by the vehicle alarm system. The remote processor 370 may
provide a notification to a user of the smart phone 256 of the break-in, for example, via the
garage door opener 100 and the network 254, or via the wireless radio 480)
[00601                      In some embodiments, the breathalyzer 450 may be employed by the remote
processor 370 for checking blood-alcohol content (BAC) of vehicle occupants or a driver, for
example. The remote processor 370 may receive results from the breathalyzer 450 and
communicate the results to a user via the speaker 410 or via a display of the GDO remote
control 302. In some embodiments, the remote processor 370 may notify a remote user that a
breathalyzer 450 test failed. For example, the notification may be sent via the remote RF
transceiver 380 or the wireless radio 480. The notification may be sent via the garage door
opener 100 or sent directly to the smart phone 256, the server 250, or a home network to
communicate the breathalyzer test notification to a user.
[00611                      In some embodiments, the doze sensor 460 may be employed by the remote
processor 370 to determine whether a driver is falling asleep while driving. The remote
processor 370 may, in turn, cause the speaker 410 or the light 405 to generate an alert or
notification to awaken the driver. For example, the doze sensor may include a camera and
associated software that analyzes captured image data to track eye movement, blinking
patterns, or both to determine whether a driver is falling asleep.
[0062]                      In some embodiments, the on-board diagnostics (OBD) connector 475 may be
employed to connect the GDO remote control 302 to an OBD connector within a vehicle, to
decode engine "trouble codes" and alert the user of the engine trouble, for example, via the
speaker 410.
[00631                      In some embodiments, the cruise card transceiver 470 may be employed to
enable a "cruise card" or "EZ- Pass" function integration with the GDO remote control 302.
A user's toll pass unique identification code is stored for access by the cruise card transceiver
                                                          14

470 so that the user does not need a separate transceiver for electronic toll collection in a
vehicle.
[0064]                      In some embodiments, the methods described below with respect to FIGS. 7, 8,
and 9 are used to implement one or more of the secondary functions described above.
[00651                      FIG. 7 is a flow chart that illustrates a method 700 for secondary functions of a
GDO remote control device based on output of a secondary sensor of the GDO remote control
device. Although explained with respect to the system 500, the method 700 is also be
applicable to other systems in some embodiments. In step 710, an input is received at a user
input of the GDO remote control 302 (i.e., a GDO remote control device). For example, in
response to user depression of the input button 382, an input signal is sent to, and received at,
the remote processor 370. In step 720, responsive to the input, the remote processor 370
communicates a user input command to the garage door opener 100 via the remote RF
transceiver 380 (also referred to as a wireless communication interface). As described above,
the user input command provides a command to operate the motor 212 that drives the garage
door 104. The command may further include a code that is used by the processor 350 of the
garage door opener 100 to confirm authenticity of the command.
[0066]                      In step 730, the remote processor 370 detects stimuli in a space associated with
the GDO remote control 302 based on sensory data output from a secondary sensor of the
GDO remote control 302. The secondary sensor includes one of the secondary components
385 of the GDO remote control 302, which provides sensory data to the remote processor
370. For example, the secondary sensor is one or more of the microphone 425, the camera
420, the accelerometer 445, the proximity sensor 440, the occupancy sensor 435, the cabin
environment sensor 430, the GNSS receiver 485, the breathalyzer 450, the burglar sensor 455,
the doze sensor 460, and the parking sensor 465. The detected stimuli and form of the
sensory data provided by the secondary sensor depends on the type of the secondary sensor.
For example, the microphone detects and outputs audio data (whether analog or digital), the
camera detects and outputs video or image data, the accelerometer 445 detects motion and
outputs motion data (e.g., along one or multiple axes), the proximity sensor 440 detects
distance and outputs distance data, the occupancy sensor 435 detects the presence or absence
of an occupant and outputs data indicative of the presence or absence of the occupant, the
                                                              15
9743041_1 (GHMatters) P107423.AU

cabin environment sensor 430 detects and outputs environmental data (e.g., air quality or
sound level) indicative of the environment of a vehicle in which the GDO remote control 302
may be, the GNSS receiver 485 detects a location of the GDO remote control 302 and outputs
corresponding location data, the breathalyzer 450 detects blood alcohol content and outputs
blood alcohol content data, the burglar sensor 455 detects presence of an individual based on
motion or heat and outputs a signal indicative of the presence of a detected individual, the
doze sensor 460 detects a driver's alertness and outputs a alertness data indicative of whether
a driver is alert, asleep, or a level in-between, and the parking sensor 465 detects a vehicle's
location relative to obstacles or a desired parking location and outputs corresponding location
data. The space considered associated with the GDO remote control 302 may vary depending
on the particular type of secondary sensor. For example, the space associated with the GDO
remote control in terms of the occupancy sensor 435 may include the cabin of a vehicle
having the GDO remote control 302, while the space associated with the GDO remote control
in terms of the breathalyzer 450 may include an area within 12 inches of the GDO remote
control 302. In some embodiments, the space associated with the GDO remote control 302
includes the sensing range of the secondary sensor or a subset thereof.
[00671                      In step 740, the remote processor 370 determines a responsive action to the
stimuli detected in the space associated with the GDO remote control 302. For example, the
remote processor 370 uses the stimuli as an input to a lookup table of the remote memory 375
that associates stimuli with responsive actions. In another example, the remote processor
compares the stimuli to one or more thresholds stored in the remote memory 375 to determine
whether a particular threshold is exceeded, and the remote memory 375 maps particular
thresholds to particular responsive actions. Accordingly, in response to detecting a particular
threshold is exceeded, the remote processor 370 identifies from the remote memory 375 the
corresponding responsive action mapped to the threshold.
[00681                      In step 750, the remote processor 370 controls one or more from the group of
the secondary components 385 that are actuatable (a secondary actuatable component) and the
accessory devices of the garage door opener 100 to perform the responsive action. For
example, in the case of controlling one of the secondary components 385 to perform the
responsive action, the remote processor 370 sends a command via the bus 390 to the
particular component. The secondary component 385, in response, executes the command.
                                                           16
9743041_1 (GHMatters) P107423.AU

For example, the secondary component 385 may include one or more of the light 405, the
speaker 410, the laser 415, the wireless radio 480, the microphone 425, the camera 420, the
OBD connector 475, the accelerometer 445, the proximity sensor 440, the occupancy sensor
435, the cabin environment sensor 430, the GNSS receiver 485, the breathalyzer 450, the
burglar sensor 455, the doze sensor 460, and the parking sensor 465. The command (to
implement the responsive action) may be an activation command or deactivation comment
(e.g., to activate or deactivate the secondary component 385) or may be a more particular
command (e.g., to convey a particular audio message via the speaker 410).
[0069]                      In the case of controlling one of the accessory devices of the garage door
opener 100, such as a speaker, a fan, an extension cord reel, a parking assist laser, an
environmental sensor, a flashlight, and a security camera, the remote processor 370 transmits
the command via the remote RF receiver 380 to the RF transceiver 246 or the wireless radio
480 (e.g., over the network 254) to the wireless transceiver 345. The command is then
provided to the accessory device, either via the bus 365 directly or by way of the processor
350 as an intermediary. The accessory device, in response, executes the command. For
example, the command (to implement the responsive action) may be an activation command
or deactivation comment (e.g., to activate or deactivate the accessory device) or may be a
more particular command (e.g., to convey a particular audio message via the speaker, set a fan
to a particular speed).
[00701                      In one example, the actuatable secondary component of the remote control
device includes the remote RF receiver 380 or the wireless radio 480 (also referred to as a
wireless communication interface). The responsive action may then includes communicating
information based on the detected stimuli via a wireless network (e.g., the RF link between
the remote RF receiver 380 and the RF transceiver 246 or the network 254) to the remote
electronic server 250, the smart phone 256, or both. In another example, the responsive action
is one or more of sending a wireless command to the garage door opener 100 to close the
garage door, to open the garage door, and to activate the accessory device.
[00711                      In another example, the stimuli detected in step 730 is a voice command, the
secondary sensor is the microphone 425, and the responsive action in step 750 corresponds to
the instruction provided in the voice command received. The sensory data output from the
                                                            17
9743041_1 (GHMatters) P107423.AU

microphone 425 includes audio signals including the voice command. The responsive action
includes one or more of sending an alert to a wireless device of the user (e.g., the smart phone
256), activating the secondary actuatable component, and activating the accessory device. In
other words, the voice commands may take various forms and implement various functions,
as discussed above with respect to the microphone 425. For example, a voice command to
"turn on fan accessory" detected in step 730 causes the remote processor 370 to send a
wireless command to the garage door opener 100 in step 750 that controls the fan accessory
device coupled to the garage door opener 100 to turn on. The alert may be sent via a wireless
network (e.g., the RF link between the remote RF receiver 380 and the RF transceiver 246 or
the network 254) to the smart phone 256.
[0072]                      In another example, the secondary actuatable component of the remote control
device in the method 700 includes the speaker 410 and the responsive action includes audibly
communicating information via the speaker 410 based on the detected stimuli in the space
associated with the GDO remote control 302. The audibly communicated information is one
or more of driving directions for parking a vehicle based on output from the parking sensor
465, object proximity alerts to a driver based on output from the proximity sensor 440, air
quality alerts to a driver based on output from the environmental sensor 430, car speed based
on output from the accelerometer 445, and an alert to awaken a driver based on images of a
driver, captured by a camera of the doze sensor 460, that are analyzed by software of the doze
sensor 460 to detect whether the driver is falling asleep.
[0073]                      In another example, the secondary actuatable component of the remote control
device in the method 700 is another sensor of the secondary components 385 that is activated
to generate a second sensory data output. This other sensor may be, for example, one or more
of the microphone 425, the camera 420, the accelerometer 445, the proximity sensor 440, the
occupancy sensor 435, the cabin environment sensor 430, the GNSS receiver 485, the
breathalyzer 450, the burglar sensor 455, the doze sensor 460, and the parking sensor 465.
However, this other sensor is selected to be of a different type than the sensor of step 730.
The second sensory data output is received by the remote processor 370 to detect a second
stimuli in the space associated with the remote control device. The remote processor 370, in
turn, determines a second responsive action based on the second stimuli.
                                                          18
9743041_1 (GHMatters) P107423.AU

[00741                      In another example, the secondary sensor of step 730 includes a proximity
sensor that senses when the GDO remote control 302 is within or beyond a predetermined
proximity of a location, such as the garage in which the garage door opener 100 resides, the
home associated with the garage, or the particular location of the garage door opener 100. In
addition to or separate from the responsive action in step 750, the remote processor 570
actuates the RF transceiver 380 to instruct the garage door opener 100 to close the garage
door when the GDO remote control 302 is beyond the predetermined proximity and the
garage door is open, and open the garage door when the GDO remote control 302 is within
the predetermined proximity and the garage door is closed. To determine whether the GDO
remote 302 is within or beyond the predetermined proximity, the remote processor 570
determines a distance value from the proximity sensor 440 and compares the distance value to
the predetermined proximity, which may be in the form of a distance threshold. As one
example, the proximity sensor 440 indicates the distance value by calculating a distance from
the garage door opener 100 using a determined strength of a signal received by the remote RF
transceiver 380 from the garage door opener 100. The strength of signal may be proportional
to the distance and thus, with a calculation or lookup table, the strength of signal may be
converted to a distance.
[00751                      In another example, the GDO remote control 302 is attached to a vehicle and
the secondary sensor in step 730 includes the accelerometer 445 that detects motion of the
vehicle. The responsive action in step 750 includes controlling the RF transceiver 380 to
communicate an alert indicating the motion of the vehicle to a wireless device of the user,
such as the smart phone 256, via the garage door opener 100 and the network 254.
[0076]                      In another example, the GDO remote control 302 may be attached within the
cabin of a vehicle. The cabin environment sensor 430 includes a carbon monoxide detector
that detects an excessive level of carbon monoxide within the vehicle, and transmits carbon
monoxide warning notification to the remote processor 370. In response, the remote
processor 370 may activate the speaker 410 to broadcast an audible warning of the level of
carbon monoxide in the cabin. Alternatively, the GDO remote control 302 may transmit the
carbon monoxide warning notification to the garage door opener 100, which may actuate an
accessory device coupled via one of the module ports 223, such as a blinking light and/or an
audible alarm that indicates a high level of carbon monoxide in the vicinity.

[00771                      In another example, the GDO remote control 302 is located within the cabin of
a vehicle and the secondary sensor in step 730 includes the occupancy sensor 435 that detects
occupancy within the cabin. The responsive action in step 750 includes controlling the RF
transceiver 380 to communicate an alert indicating motion within the vehicle to a wireless
device of the user, such as the smart phone 256, via the garage door opener 100 and the
network 254. In some embodiments, the responsive action is further conditioned on the
remote processor 370 determining that the vehicle is locked (e.g., based on a message
communicated by the vehicle an received by the GDO remote control 302), that the current
time is within a time scheduled for occupancy monitoring (e.g., based on a schedule stored in
the remote memory 375), or that the sound level within the cabin is above a certain threshold
as sensed by the microphone 425.
[00781                      FIG. 8 is a flow chart that illustrates a method 800 for wireless communication
via secondary components 385 of the GDO remote control 302. Although explained with
respect to the system 500, the method 800 is also be applicable to other systems in some
embodiments. Additionally, the method 800 is explained with the user of three particular
examples. More particularly, in a first example described with respect to the method 800, the
GDO remote control 302 includes a secondary function as a hands-free, microphone-speaker
phone adapter for a wireless phone. In a second example described with respect to the
method 800, the GDO remote control 302 includes a secondary function of providing traffic
alerts. In a third example described with respect to the method 800, the GDO remote control
302 includes a secondary function of providing toll payments. These three examples are used
for illustration purposes. However, the method 800 is not limited to these three examples.
[00791                      The method 800 begins with steps 710 and 720 as described above with
respect to the method 700. That is, in step 710, an input is received at a user input of the
GDO remote control 302 (i.e., a remote control device), and, in step 720, responsive to the
input, the remote processor 370 communicates a user input command to the garage door
opener 100 via the remote RF transceiver 380.
[00801                      In step 810, the remote processor 370 of the GDO remote control 302 receives
data from a secondary component 385. In the first (hands-free phone adapter) example, the
data includes an audio signal output from the microphone 425. In the second (traffic alert)
                                                              20
9743041_1 (GHMatters) P107423.AU

example, the data includes location data from the GNSS receiver 485. In the third (toll pass)
example, the data includes a user's toll pass unique identification code from a memory of the
cruise card transceiver 470. For example, the GDO remote control 302 may be positioned
within a vehicle (e.g., on a visor or otherwise near or on a front windshield). When the
vehicle passes within range of a toll pass reader, such as while on a tool highway having toll
pass readers associated with vehicle lanes on the highway at toll areas, the toll pass reader
transmits a read request to the cruise card transceiver 470. In response to the read request, the
cruise card transceiver 470 transmits the toll pass unique identification code to the remote
processor 370.
[00811                      In step 820, the remote processor 370 wirelessly transmits the data received in
step 810 to a wireless device via a wireless transceiver of the GDO remote control 302. In the
first example, the remote processor 370 controls the wireless radio 480 to transmit the audio
signal from the microphone 425 to a wireless phone, such as the smart phone 256. For
example, the wireless radio 480 and the smart phone 256 may communicate via short-range
radio frequency (RF) communications, such as using the Bluetooth protocol. In the second
example, the location data is transmitted via the wireless radio 480 to a remote server (e.g.,
the server 250). For example, the wireless radio 480 may be a cellular radio that
communicates with a cellular data network, and the location data is transmitted to the server
via the cellular data network using, for example, the 3G or Long-Term Evolution (LTE)
protocol. Alternatively, the wireless radio 480 may communicate the location data to the
smart phone 256 using short-range RF communications, and the smart phone 256 may route
the communications via the cellular data network to the remote server. In the third example,
the remote processor 370 controls the cruise card transceiver 470 to transmit the tool pass
unique identification code to a tool pass reader.
[0082]                      In step 830, the remote processor 370 receives wireless data from the wireless
device via the wireless transceiver. In the first example, the wireless data includes voice data
from the wireless phone, such as the smart phone 256. For example, the voice data is
obtained by a microphone of the smart phone 256. In the second example, the wireless data
includes traffic data from the remote server. For example, the traffic data may include a
traffic alert indicating a level of traffic, construction, or accidents on the roadway on which
the location data indicated that the vehicle having the GDO remote control 302 is driving.
                                                           21
9743041_1 (GHMatters) P107423.AU

The remote server includes navigation services and databases configured to provide traffic
alerts based on location data. In some embodiments, the location data is provided to the
remote server (in step 820) with a user identifier that identifies the user of the GDO remote
control 302. The user identifier is used to index user data on the remote server, such as
typical travel routes (e.g., to/from place of employment, school, home, or other common
destinations of the user). In turn, traffic alerts are generated based on the location data in
combination with the user profile data to identify when a traffic alert applies to the user's
typical travel routes given the present location indicate dby the location data. In the third
example, the wireless data includes confirmation data that confirms payment of the toll.
[00831                      In step 840, the remote processor 370 audibly communicates the wireless data
via the speaker 410 of the GDO remote control 302. In the first example, the voice data
received from the remote wireless phone is communicated to a user via the speaker 410. In
the second example, the traffic alert received is communicated to a user via the speaker 410.
In the third example, a confirmation is audibly conveyed via the speaker 410. In some
embodiments, in the third example, the receipt of confirmation data and audible conveyance
of the confirmation data is bypassed.
[0084]                      FIG. 9 is a flow chart that illustrates a method 900 for communicating vehicle
status to users via secondary components of a garage door opener remote control device.
Although explained with respect to the system 500, the method 900 is also be applicable to
other systems in some embodiments. The method 900 begins with steps 710 and 720 as
described above with respect to the method 700. That is, in step 710, an input is received at a
user input of the GDO remote control 302 (i.e., a remote control device), and, in step 720,
responsive to the input, the remote processor 370 communicates a user input command to the
garage door opener 100 via the remote RF transceiver 380.
[00851                      In step 910, the remote processor 370 of the GDO remote control 302 receives
vehicle status information regarding a status of a vehicle via one or more of the secondary
components 385 that are communicatively coupled to vehicle electronics, for example, an
electronic processor on the vehicle that is in combination with vehicle sensors, vehicle
gauges, or vehicle alarm and warning systems. For example, the on board diagnostics (OBD)
connector 475 may be connected to the vehicle electronics by way of a vehicle-side OBD
                                                              22
9743041_1 (GHMatters) P107423.AU

connector that mates with the OBD connector 475. The remote processor 370 and the vehicle
electronics communicate via the mated OBD connectors to provide vehicle status information
from the vehicle to the remote processor 370. In some embodiments, the remote processor
370 communicates with the vehicle electronics using the wireless radio 480, for example,
using short-range RF communications.
[00861                      In step 920, the remote processor 370 communicates the vehicle status
information to a user. For example, the vehicle status information may be communicated via
the speaker 410 of the GDO remote control 302, via the wireless radio 480 to a remote
wireless communication device (e.g., a wireless phone, personal computer, or server), or via
the laser 415 to project vehicle status information on a surface (e.g., a wall at which the laser
415 is directed).
[00871                      In one example, the method 900 is used to detect and then communicate to a
user that a vehicle door is open, the tire pressure is low, low oil warning, or that an active
vehicle component (e.g., engine or lights) should be turned off. The remote processor 370
may determine from the received vehicle status information that the door is open, that the tire
pressure is low, that the oil level is low, or that vehicle components are active. The remote
processor 370 is configured to determine, in step 920, that the vehicle door should be closed
because it has been open for more than a predetermined amount of time (e.g., based on a
comparison of the current time to the time at which the vehicle door open information was
first received), or that the active vehicle component should be deactivated because it has been
active for more than a predetermined amount of time and no occupants are present in the
vehicle (based on output from the occupancy sensor 435). These warnings may then be
conveyed in step 920 in various ways, as noted above.
[00881                      In another example, a parking sensor of the vehicle is used to detect proximity
(i.e., distance) to a wall or obstacle in front of or behind the vehicle. The distance is conveyed
to the remote processor 370 in step 910. In turn, in step 920, the remote processor 370
controls the laser 415, speaker 410, or both, to visually or audibly convey the distance and an
instruction to stop when the remote processor 370 determines that the distance is below a
threshold (e.g., "3ft," "2ft," "Ift," "stop"). Accordingly, in this example, the GDO remote
control 302 provides parking assistance based on data received from the vehicle.
                                                           23
9743041_1 (GHMatters) P107423.AU

[00891                      In another example, the remote processor 370 receives in step 910 an
indication that the vehicle is being broken into based on a message from the vehicle
electronics (e.g., in response to a detected broken window). In response, in step 920, the
remote processor 370 controls the wireless radio 480 to communicate a notification to the
smart phone 256, either directly via short range RF communications or via a network, such as
a cellular network, Wi-Fi network, the Internet, or a combination thereof. In response, the
smart phone 256 generates one or more of an audible, visual, and tactile alert to the user.
[0090]                      The processors described herein are electronic processors and may be
configured to carry out the functionality attributed thereto via execution of instructions stored
on a compute readable medium (e.g. one of the illustrated memories), in hardware circuits
(e.g., an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) or field programmable gate array)
configured to perform the functions, or a combination thereof.
[0091]                      FIGS. 10A and 1OB illustrate a front and side view, respectively, of the GDO
remote control 302 according to some embodiments. As illustrated, the GDO remote control
302 includes a housing 1000 and a clip 1005. The clip is used, for example, to secure the
GDO remote control 302 to a sun visor in a vehicle. The GDO remote control 302 further
includes the input button 382 to actuate the garage door opener, the speaker 410, and the
microphone 425, as discussed above. Additionally, the housing 1000 contains and supports
one or more further secondary components 385 illustrated in FIG. 6 and discussed above, for
example, with respect to FIGS. 6-9.
[0092]                      Although the invention has been described in detail with reference to certain
preferred embodiments, variations and modifications exist within the scope and spirit of one
or more independent aspects of the invention as described.
