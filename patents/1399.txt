   BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
 5 Most nucleated eukaryotic cells, whether unicellular organisms or constituents of multicellular
   organism including humans, contain acidified vacuoles that are critical for cellular maintenance
   and function. In mammalian cells, these vacuoles comprise lysosomes and other endosomal
   vesicular organelles. The pH of the interior of lysosomes is typically about 4.5 to 5, maintained
   by vacuolar ATP-dependent proton pumps and also by Donnan equilibrium effects. Lysosomes
 0 contribute to cytosolic pH buffering, protecting the cell from acidic environments, and are also
   primary sites for degrading and recycling the constituents of aging or damaged organelles such
   as mitochondria, a process known as autophagy. There are several important pathological
   conditions where lysosomal characteristics are altered and contribute to disease pathogenesis,
   presenting a potential target for pharmacological therapy.
 5 A growing body of evidence indicates that a common phenotypic change in invasive cancer cells
   is a redirection of lysosomes to participate in destruction of surrounding cells via exocytosis of
   acidic contents, including enzymes. Proteolytic enzymes normally found in lysosomes but
   secreted by cancer cells, such as cathepsins, can degrade extracellular matrix proteins,
   facilitating tumor invasion and metastasis. Furthermore, lysosomes and other acidic vacuolar
30 organelles are often enlarged in cancer cells, which aids pH buffering; many solid tumors
   generate an acidic extracellular environment, favoring invasion, which requires that cancer cells
   adapt to both produce and tolerate a low extracellular pH. Cancer cells selected in vitro for
   invasive potential have larger, more acidic lysosomes than do less aggressive cells. Cancer cells
   exposed to ionizing radiation undergo a protective response involving enlargement and
35 acidification of lysosomes. A related protective response through cancer cells acquire survival
   advantages is activation of autophagy, which involves fusion of autophagosomes containing
   damaged organelles or other cell debris, with lysosomes; disruption of autophagy can impair
                                                      1

      WO 2014/120995                                                         PCT/US2014/013992
cancer cell viability. Some cancer cells also sequester chemotherapy agents in lysosomes, as a
mechanism of drug resistance. Chloroquine, an antimalarial drug that accumulates in
mammalian lysosomes, potentiates, or restores sensitivity to, anticancer activity of several
classes of chemotherapy agents and targeted small molecule and antibody cancer treatments.
Lysosomotropic fluorescent dyes such as acridine orange can be used to visually differentiate
tumors in situ from surrounding tissues, indicating a potential sharp distinction for specific
lysosome-targeting cytotoxic agents to selectively kill cancer cells.
Lysosomal alterations are also important features of common inflammatory diseases, especially
those involving activated macrophages, where exocytosis of lysosomal enzymes, cytokines, and
some inflammatory mediators such as HMBG1 that are processed and released via lysosomes
can participate in tissue damage and both local and systemic inflammation. Glucocorticoid
signaling is also linked to lysosomes, such that compromising lysosomal function can enhance
anti-inflammatory pathways mediating glucocorticoid effects.
Most fungi have acidic vacuoles similar to lysosomes. These acidic vacuoles are critical for ion
and pH homeostasis, storage of amino acids, autophagy and for processing some proteins.
Vacuoles are acidified via a proton pump, the vacuolar H*-ATPase, or "V-ATPase", and it is
known that fungi with inactivating mutations of subunits of V-ATPase that result in impaired
vacuole acidification also lose virulence and grow poorly. Ergosterol, a fungal-specific steroid
analogous to cholesterol in mammalian cells as a major membrane component, is critical for
conformation and activity of the V-ATPase, and V-ATPase dysfunction appears to be a major
mechanism of antifungal activity of ergosterol synthesis inhibitors, which includes several
classes of existing antifungal agents. Antifungal agents that act via binding to specific proteins,
e.g. enzyme inhibitors, are inherently vulnerable to development of drug resistance via single
mutations in genes encoding target proteins. Agents that target fungi via adequately specific
targeting and disruption of fungal acidic vacuoles by cation trapping may be less susceptible to
development of resistance through point mutations than are drugs acting by binding to specific
protein targets, due to impaired viability and virulence when vacuolar acidification, is impaired.

Clinically important antimalarial drugs are known that accumulate in acidic vacuoles and
lysosomes and their biological activity is largely mediated through their concentration in acidic
vacuoles, not only in malaria but in inflammatory diseases, some cancers and non-malarial
infections by fungi and unicellular and protozoal parasites. Quinoline analog antimalarial drugs
target malaria plasmodia via cation trapping in acidic digestive vacuoles, where they can
accumulate to concentrations several orders of magnitude higher than in extracellular spaces. A
large molar fraction of chloroquine, mefloquine, quinacrine and several of their congeners are
uncharged at the usual extracellular pH of about 7.4 and the cytoplasmic pH of 7.1, and can
thereby pass through cellular and organelle membranes. In an acidic environment such as the
interior of a lysosome or fungal acidic vacuole, these antimalarials are predominantly cationic
and are thereby restricted from free passage through the vacuolar membrane. Antimalarials such
as chloroquine impair processing of heme from hemoglobin ingested by malaria plasmodia after
accumulating in the feeding vacuoles, accounting for much of their specific toxicity to
plasmodia. However, chloroquine and similar quinoline-analog antimalarials can accumulate in
mammalian lysosomes and fungal acidic vacuoles and impair vacuolar function to a degree
sufficient to provide some clinical benefit, if only by partically deacidifying the vacuoles.
Chloroquine is used for treatment of in chronic autoimmune and inflammatory diseases such as
systemic lupus erythematosis or rheumatoid arthritis, with moderate efficacy. A degree of
antifungal activity has been reported for antimalarials such as chloroquine or quinacrine, both as
single agents or in combination with other classes of antifungal agents, such as fluconazole,
notably in animal models of systemic cryptococcosis. However, their activity is suboptimal,
yielding incomplete fungal growth inhibition. Recent work has also demonstrated moderate
growth inhibitory activity of chloroquine, mefloquine and other weakly cationic drugs such as
siramesine in animal models of cancer. Existing lysosomotropic agents such as antimalarial
quinolone compounds can thus display some therapeutically relevant activity in diseases in
which acidic vacuoles contribute to pathogenesis. However, the activity and potency of
antimalarials in such diseases are limited, as the target cells can tolerate accumulation of
relatively high concentrations of the antimalarials; the specific lethal effect of quinoline
compounds in malaria is largely attributed to disruption of heme processing within plasmodial
feeding vacuoles, a mechanism of cytotoxicity not applicable in the areas of inflammatory
                                                   3

disease, cancer or fungal infections. Despite the body of evidence indicating strong potential for
targeting lysosomes for treating cancers, existing agents have not shown adequate activity or
therapeutic index for effectively treating cancer in humans.
"Lyosomotropic detergents", comprising weakly cationic heterocyclic moieties bearing a single
alkyl chain with approximately 10 to 14 carbon atoms, were reported be potently cytotoxic to
mammalian cells and to display broad spectrum antifungal activity in vitro. This class of agents
accumulate in lysosomes and acidic vacuoles via the same type of cation trapping process
through which antimalarials are concentrated, and when they reach a critical micellar
concentration in the vacuole, they behave as detergents, damaging vacuolar membranes. They
display a characteristic sigmoid dose-response curve, as a consequence of their formation of
micellar micro structures. However, there is no information about activity or safety of this class
of agents in vivo in animal models of relevant diseases.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
Without wishing to be bound by theory, this invention provides compounds and their use for
treating diseases characterized by pathogenic cells featuring lysosomes or other acidic vacuoles
with disease-related alterations predisposing them to accumulation of compounds of the
invention, which then selectively inactivate or eliminate such pathogenic cells. Compounds of
the invention, many of which are aminoquinoline and aminoquinazoline derivatives, feature
significant improvements in potency and activity over known aminoquinoline drugs such as
chloroquine, as a consequence of structural moieties that potently disrupt lysosomal or vacuolar
membrane integrity when the compounds accumulate in acidic vacuoles in cells. Diseases that
are at least moderately responsive to antimalarial quinoline derivatives and analogs are in general
more effectively treated with compounds of the invention. Such diseases broadly comprise
inflammatory diseases, neoplastic diseases, including both hematologic cancers and solid tumors,

    Some compounds of the formula 3 and some compounds of the formula 6 are commercially
available. The compound of formula 3 is reacted with the compound of formula 4 to give the
compound of formula 5 via reaction of step (a): the compound of formula 3 is treated with a
suitable base and then is reacted with the compound of formula 4. The selectivity of the reaction
for substitution of only one of the bromides of the compound of formula 4 can be increased by
using a stoichiometric excess of the compound of formula 3. If n is 1, any base that is commonly
used to convert an alcohol to an alkoxide is suitable, such as sodium hydride or a hindered alkali
metal alkoxide such as sodium isopropoxide. If n is 1, the base must be completely reacted with
the compound of formula 3 before the addition of the compound of formula 4 is performed. If n
is 0, any base that is commonly used to convert a phenol to a phenoxide is suitable, such as
potassium carbonate or sodium carbonate. If n is 0, the compound of formula 4 may be present
when the base is reacted with the compound of formula 3.
    The compound of formula 5 is converted to the compound of formula 6 via reactions of step
(b), the Gabriel synthesis of primary amines. The compound of formula 5 is reacted with
potassium phthalimide under conventionally used conditions to give the phthalimide
intermediate, which is converted to the compound of formula 6 under conventionally used
conditions such as hydrazine monohydrate in ethanol at reflux. Any method for the cleavage of
phthalimides may be used.
    The compound of formula 6 is converted to the compound of formula 7 via step (c): the
compound of formula 6 reacts with the compound of formula 7 in the presence of a tertiary
amine base such as triethylamine, diisopropylethylamine, or tripropylamine at elevated
temperature in a suitable solvent, such as 2-propanol heated at reflux if T is N or 1-pentanol
heated at reflux or dimethylformamide or N-methylpyrrolidinone at 130-150 0C if T is CH.

    The compound of formula I wherein G is imidazoquinolyl unsubstituted or substituted at a
ring carbon by halo, methyl, or perfluoromethyl; NH is absent; R 1 is hydrogen, OH, NH 2 , or
N(CH 3) 2 ; and either: a) AQXYZ is represented by R8 , and R 9 is a branched or unbranched alkyl
having from 1 to 16 carbon atoms, unsubstituted or substituted by hydroxy or alkoxy having
from 1 to 12 carbon atoms, provided that if substituted by hydroxy or alkoxy R 9 cannot have 1
carbon atom, or b) AQXYZ is represented by R 9, and R8 is hydrogen or alkyl having from 1 to
15 carbon atoms unsubstituted or substituted by alkoxy having 1 or 2 carbon atoms or acetoxy
can be prepared starting from the compound of formula 27 where R 1 is hydrogen or hydroxy and
R 2 is hydrogen, halo, methyl, or perfluoromethyl via the reaction scheme in Scheme 10. In step
(a), compound of the formula 27 where R1 is hydrogen or hydroxy is nitrated to produce the
compound of the formula 28 using nitric acid in hot acetic acid or propionic acid. In step (b), the
compound of formula 28 is treated with a chlorinating agent such as phosphoryl chloride, alone
or in combination with phosphorus(V) chloride, or with phenylphosphonic dichloride to produce
the compound of formula 29, where R 1 is chloro if the compound of formula 28 had hydroxy as
R . In step (c), the compound of formula 29 is reacted with the compound of formula 30 in the
presence of a tertiary amine base such as triethylamine in an inert solvent such as
dichoromethane, aided by gentle warming to produce the compound of formula 31. It is well
established in the literature that the 4-chloro of the compound of formula 29 where R 1 is chloro
is the more reactive with amines. Any of the amines described in the invention can be used in
step (c). It was discovered that if compound of formula 29 where R1 is chloro is stirred with the
compound of formula 30 in a mixture of dimethylformamide and dichloromethane initially, and
then the dichloromethane is replaced with toluene and the mixture is heated at reflux, the
compound of formula 31 where R1 is N(CH 3) 2 is produced. In step (d), the nitro group of the
compound of formula 31 is reduced by any of a number of methods. If R1 is hydrogen or chloro,
hydrogenation using 5% or 10% Pd-C or reduction using zinc dust and hydrochloric acid will
produce the compound of formula 32 where R1 is hydrogen. If R 1 is chloro, hydrogenation using
10% Pt-C will produce the compound of formula 32 where R 1 is chloro. If R 1 is dimethylamino,
all these methods leave R unchanged. In step (e), the ortho-diamine of the compound of formula
32 is heated with the carboxylic acid compound of formula 33 or the compound of formula 34,
the ortho ester of the compound of 33, to produce the compound of formula 35. Any ortho ester

analog of the compound of formula 33 may be used. In step (f), if the compound of formula 35
where R 1 is chloro is treated with hydrolytic conditions, the compound of formula 36 where R1 is
hydroxy is produced. In step (f), if the compound of formula 35 where R1 is chloro is treated
with ammonia or a primary amine, the R -amino derivative of the compound of formula 36 is
produced. In step (f), if the compound of formula 35 where R 1 is chloro is treated with zinc dust
and hydrochloric acid, the compound of formula 36 where R1 is hydrogen is produced. The
compound of formula 35 where R and R 2 and R 8 are hydrogen and R 9 is stable to organolithium
bases can be reacted with an organolithium base and then alkylated by an organohalide or
aldehyde to give the compound of formula 36 where R contains the derivative of the alkylation
reagent.

of formula I, by the scheme shown in Scheme 14. The compound of the formula 53 is treated
with a strong base such as sodium tert-butoxide in a suitable solvent such as dimethylformamide,
and the resulting amide anion is treated with the compound of formula 55 to produce the
compound of formula 54 via the reaction of step (a). If the amide anion is in resonance with a
neighboring nitrogen, the alkylation by the compound of formula 55 occurs at the less hindered
nitrogen selectively. The primary alkyl iodide, chloride, alkanesulfonate, or arylsulfonate of
AQXYZ can be used in place of the compound of formula 55 for the reaction of step (a).

Any compound of formula 58 where G is a monocyclic, bicyclic, or tricyclic aromatic ring
having one, two, or three ring nitrogen atoms as defined in Claim 1, where a ring carbon atom is
bonded to an NH 2 group, can undergo an alkylation procedure to produce a compound with the
formula 59, where A,   Q, X, Y, and Z are as defined in Claim 1, starting from the compound of
formula 56, where (AQXYZ) is a radical that is terminated by a primary alcohol group, by the
scheme shown in Scheme 15. Many compounds of the formula 58 are available commercially.
The compound of the formula 56, where the radical (AQXYZ) is terminated by a primary
alcohol function and where (AQXYZ) does not contain another alcohol group or an amino
group, can undergo oxidation by any of a variety of conventional methods such as the Swern
oxidation or oxidation by tetrapropylammonium perruthenate/N-methylmorpholine N-oxide to
produce the compound of formula 57 via the reaction of step (a). The compound of formula 58

can undergo reductive alkylation by the compound of formula 57 via the reaction of step (b)
using any conventional method for amine reductive alkylation such as by sodium
cyanoborohydride in tetrahydrofuran. Alternatively, the compound of formula 58 can undergo
acylation by the carboxylic acid radical of (AQXYZ) via the reaction of step (d) using any
conventional method for amide formation such as a carbodiimide condensation or a mixed
anhydride acylation using isopropyl chloroformate. Also, step (d) can be carried out using the
acid chloride derivative of the compound of formula 60, which can be produced using any
conventional reagent for the preparation of acid chlorides such as thionyl chloride or oxalyl
chloride. The compound of formula 60 can be produced from the compound of formula 56 via
the reaction of step (c) using any suitable conventional reagent for the oxidation of alcohols such
as the Jones reagent. The amide group of the compound of formula 61, where (AQXYZ) does
not contain an ester or another amide group, can be reduced to the amino group of the compound
of formula 59 via the reaction of step (e) using a suitable reducing agent such as lithium
aluminum hydride.

USES AND METHODS OF TREATMENT
This invention provides certain compounds, described below, for treating diseases characterized
by pathogenic cells featuring lysosomes or other acidic vacuoles with disease-related alterations
predisposing them to accumulation of compounds of the invention, which then selectively
inactivate or eliminate such pathogenic cells. Compounds of the invention, many of which are
aminoquinoline and aminoquinazoline derivatives, feature significant improvements in potency
                                                47

      WO 2014/120995                                                         PCT/US2014/013992
and activity over known aminoquinoline drugs such as chloroquine, as a consequence of
structural moieties that potently disrupt lysosomal or vacuolar membrane integrity when the
compounds accumulate in acidic vacuoles in cells. Diseases that are at least moderately
responsive to antimalarial quinoline derivatives and analogs are in general more effectively
treated with compounds of the invention. Such diseases broadly comprise inflammatory
diseases, neoplastic diseases, including both hematologic cancers and solid tumors, and
infections by eukaryotic pathogens, including fungi and several classes of protozoal or other
unicellular parasites.
ANTI-INFLAMMATORY USE
An important action of compounds of the invention is anti-inflammatory activity, providing
utility for treating or preventing diseases or symptoms related to excessive tissue inflammation.
This invention also provides compositions containing a compound of this invention as well as the
use of a compound of this invention for the manufacture of a medicament for treatment or
prevention of inflammatory diseases. Compounds of the invention display selectivity for
suppressing or inactivating macrophages that have been stimulated into a pro-inflammatory state,
with less of an effect on non-stimulated macrophages. Activated pro-inflammatory macrophages
contribute to pathogenesis of a large variety of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.
Macrophages are both antigen presenting cells and effectors for tissue damage directed by
autoreactive T cells, and participate in tissue damage and dysfunction in diseases including but
not limited to rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosis, psoriasis, inflammatory bowel
disease, and atopic dermatitis. Inflammatory macrophages participate in many systemic
diseases, including autoimmune diseases, cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, and
neurodegenerative conditions. Activated macrophages play a primary role in tissue damage in
instability of atherosclerotic plaques, with consequent risk of rupture and thrombotic vessel
occlusion. Activated macrophages in adipose tissue contribute to metabolic abnormalities
including insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes and other consequences of obesity. Osteoclasts are
macrophage-like cells that mediate bone degeneration in osteoporosis and in participate in bone
destruction and "bone pain" in cancers arising in or metastasized to bones. Compositions of the
                                                  48

      WO 2014/120995                                                           PCT/US2014/013992
invention are useful for treating these and other disorders in which activated macrophages
contribute to inflammatory disease pathogenesis.
Several classes of topical agents are used for treatment of inflammatory diseases of the skin, such
as atopic dermatitis, eczema or psoriasis. Corticosteroids are widely used, but have the potential
for both local and systemic toxicities, particularly with prolonged use. They can cause local skin
atrophy or thinning, which may lead to disruption of the skin, as well as telangiectasia.
Furthermore, topical corticosteroids can be absorbed systemically in amounts sufficient to cause
systemic side effects. A second class of agents for treatment of atopic dermatitis is T cell
immunosuppressants, such as the calcineurin inhibitors tacrolimus and pimecrolimus. Their
local and systemic immunosuppressive effects have led to concerns about depressing
immuno surveillance of cancers, including melanomas and lymphomas.
Vitamin D analogs, notably calcipotriene, are known for topical treatment of psoriasis.
Calciptoriene acts by inhibiting excessive proliferation of keratinocytes. Application to normal
skin is contra-indicated due to a bleaching effect and there is also a possibility of adverse events
from systemic absorption. Dermal irritation or itching is known as a side effect of calcipotriene.
Compounds of the invention are particularly active against macrophage precursors that have
been activated by exposure to vitamin D3. It is possible that psoriasis treatment with
calcipotriene, while providing some improvements by inhibiting keratinocyte proliferation, may
also direct local macrophages toward a pro-inflammatory state, contributing to known side
effects such as irritation, and limiting the net therapeutic effect. The ability of compounds of the
invention to inactivate pro-inflammatory vitamin D3-primed macrophage precursors as shown in
several Examples below indicates that combination topical treatment with compounds of the
invention and vitamin D analogs may provide unexpected benefits in psoriasis and psoriatic
dermatitis, both in treating the inflammatory epidermal hyperproliferation and in reducing
irritation or itching as side effects of vitamin D analogs.
Compounds of the invention are useful for treating ocular inflammation, including keratitis,
whether caused by infection (fungal, bacterial, amoebic) or by non-infectious triggers such as
corneal injury or contact lenses. Compounds of the invention are especially suitable for fungal
                                                   49

      WO 2014/120995                                                         PCT/US2014/013992
keratitis, counteracting both infectious fungi and concurrent inflammatory damage. Compounds
of the invention inhibit corneal angiogenesis and other inflammatory changes in response to
mechanical or chemical injury.
Compounds of the invention are useful for treating a variety of inflammatory or
hyperproliferative skin conditions or lesions, including but not limited to eczema, atopic
dermatitis, psoriasis, and impetigo. Impetigo is a superficial bacterial skin infection with
inflammatory damage to the epidermia; compounds of the invention both suppress inflammation
and have direct inhibitory or bactericidal effects on gram positive bacteria, including but not
limited to Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus pyogenes, the primary organisms
responsible for impetigo. Compounds of the invention also inhibit pre-neoplastic and neoplastic
skin alterations, which often exhibit characteristics of both inflammation and neoplasia,
including but not limited to actinic keratosis, seborrheic keratoses and warts.
Examples E and F demonstrate efficacy of compounds of the invention for treating skin
inflammation and psoriatic dermatitis in established mouse models of human skin disorders.
Macrophages and related cells types contribute to pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases
involving the adaptive immune system both as antigen presenting cells and as effectors
damaging tissues after inappropriate stimulation by T cells, which secrete interferon gamma and
other inflammatory mediators that recruit and activate macrophages. Compounds of the
invention disrupt antigen presentation by macrophages and dendritic cells, and also inactivate
pro-inflammatory effector macrophages that damage tissues. A general guidance is that
compounds of the invention are useful for treating chronic or episodic autoimmune diseases
where chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine or other antimalarial quinoline analogs display activity
in humans or relevant animal models, and are generally more potent and active than the
antimalarials in inflammatory and non-malaria infectious diseases. Such diseases include but are
not limited to rheumatoid arthritis, systemic and discoid lupus erythematosis, psoriatic arthritis,
vasculitis, Sjogrens syndrome, scleroderma, autoimmune hepatitis, and multiple sclerosis.
Macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) is an acute complication of several autoimmune
diseases, especially in childhood-onset conditions such as idiopathic juvenile arthritis where it
                                                  50

affects more than 10% of patients, and also in inflammatory bowel diseases. In MAS,
macrophages are over-activated, causing damage to the hematopoietic system and systemic
inflammation; MAS is sometimes lethal. Compounds of the invention are useful for treatment of
MAS, and are optionally delivered orally or by intravenous injection or infusion.
Example G shows beneficial activity of compounds of the invention when administered orally to
mice in a model of multiple sclerosis, an autoimmune disease.
For treatment of chronic autoimmune disorders, compounds of the invention are administered
systemically, preferably orally. For treatment of acute inflammatory conditions, or flares of
autoimmune diseases, intravenous treatment with compounds of the invention is an optional
suitable delivery route.
For oral or intravenous treatment of autoimmune or inflammatory diseases, compounds of the
invention are typically administered in doses ranging from 1 to 1000 milligrams per day,
advantageously 100 to 600 milligrams per day, in single doses or divided into two or three doses
per day.
ANTIFUNGAL AND ANTIPARASITIC USES
The compounds of this invention are useful in inhibiting fungal growth, both in vivo and ex vivo.
Accordingly this invention also provides methods and uses for inhibiting the growth of a fungus
in a mammalian subject, for example a human. These methods can be used to treat and to prevent
fungal infection. Ex vivo, it is useful to treat surfaces with a compound of this invention to inhibit
or prevent fungal growth, or in agriculture or horticulture to prevent or treat fungi that affect
valuable plants. This invention also provides compositions containing a compound of this
invention as well as the use of a compound of this invention for the manufacture of a
medicament for inhibiting the growth of a fungus.
This invention is based, in part, on the finding that the compounds of this invention are effective
in inhibiting the growth of a variety of fungal species, as shown in the biological activity
examples below. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that compounds of this
disclosure exploit the vulnerability of the fungal acidic vacuole. They are believed to
                                                    51

     WO 2014/120995                                                          PCT/US2014/013992
accumulate in acidic vacuoles via cation trapping, and furthermore exert antifungal activity by
disrupting the structure and function of the acidic vacuoles.
In accordance with this invention, the growth of fungi generally is inhibited. Examples of fungi
that can be inhibited include but are not limited to Candida, Saccharomyces, Trichophyton,
Cryptococcus, Aspergillus, and Rhizopus. In more specific embodiments of this invention the
fungus is Candida albicans; Candida glabrata; Saccharomyces cerevisiae ; Trichophyton
rubrum; Cryptococcus neoformans, for example Cryptococcus neoformans serotypes D and A;
and Aspergillus fumigatus.
This invention also provides methods of treating and preventing parasitic infections. Due to the
capability of compounds of the invention to enter and accumulate within acidic vacuoles in cells,
they are useful for treating infections due to parasitic microorganisms that reside within acidic
vacuoles in macrophages and other cell types. Tuberculosis (mycobacteria), listeriaor
staphylococcus (gram positive bacteria), cryptococcus (fungus), and leishmania and
trypanosomes (amoebae), Coxiella burnetii (gram negative bacteria), and Plasnodiuni(some of
which cause malaria) are nonlimiting examples of important such infectious organisms, in which
residence within macrophages can protect the organisms from cellular or humoral immunity, or
reduce the efficacy of drug treatments.
Compounds of the invention, which bear lipophilic moieties and are generally partially neutral at
physiological p-1 (7.3), can pass freely into acidic vacuoles harboring parasites, and are
concentrated and trapped there due to ionization in the acidic environment (pH 4-6.5). These
compounds disrupt the structure and function of acidic vacuoles as hospitable sites for parasites
and also have direct antiparasitic activity, due to acidic vacuoles within many parasitic
organisms,
Parasites whose viability or virulence is dependent on integrity and function of an acidic vacuole
are also vulnerable to compounds of the invention, similarto the basis for their antifungal
activity. The acidic vacuole of malaria plasmodia provides an environment for concentration of
compounds of the invention, Similarly, trypanosomes have a large acidic vacuole which is
necessary for utilization of environmental nutrients. Compounds of the invention are useful for
                                                   52

     WO 2014/120995                                                           PCT/US2014/013992
treatment or prevention of malaria and trypanosome infections. More broadly, protozoal
parasites in general use acidified digestive vacuoles for acquisition and digestion of food, and are
therefore susceptible to antiparasitic actions of compounds of the invention.
The antimalarial drug chloroquine is reported to have antiparasitic activity against a variety of
organisms harbored in acidic vacuoles in host cells, or which have acidic vacuoles themselves,
including but not limited to tuberculosis mycobacteria, cryptosporidium, leishmania and
cryptococcus. In general, chloroquine acts by accumulating in acidic vacuoles via cation
trapping. Activity of chloroquine is thus an indicator of likely activity of compounds of the
inventions (many of which comprise an aminoquinoline or other heterocycle similar to that of
chloroquine for the purpose of targeting acidic vacuoles), with the difference that compounds of
the invention are substantially more potent and active than is chloroquine, as demonstrated in
Cryptococcus neoforniansin Example K, where chloroquine produced less than 50% growth
inhibition at a concentration of 100 micromolar, whereas many compounds of the invention
produced 100% growth inhibition at much lower concentrations.        Chloroquine, despite
published reports showing that it can improve survival in animal models of cryptococcosis,
displays a ceiling of about 40% inhibition of C. neoformans growth in vitro, whereas compounds
of the invention are substantially more potent than chloroquine and can cause 100% inhibition of
Cryptococcus growth, due to superior disruption of the membranes of acidic vacuoles in which
the respective drugs are accumulated,
For treatment of fungal or parasitic infections, compounds of the invention are administered in
vehicles and by routes of administration appropriate for the nature and location of the infection.
For dermal or nail infections, compound of the invention are applied in a topical formulation
which is optionally a lotion, ointment, solution, suspension, or spray. For ocular fungal
infections, compounds of the invention are formulated in eyedrops. For systemic infections,
compounds of the invention are administered orally in tablets, capsules, dragees, solutions or
suspensions, or administered systemically by injection in saline, lipid emulsions, liposomes or
other standard parenteral vehicles. Lung infections, especially involving organisms residing in
alveolar macrophages, are optionally treated via inhalational delivery of compounds of the
invention and suitable excipients known to be acceptable for inhalational drug delivery. For
                                                   53

      WO 2014/120995                                                          PCT/US2014/013992
intravenous or oral administration to treat systemic infections, compounds of the invention are
administered in doses ranging from 10 to 2000 milligrams per day, advantageously 200 to 1000
milligrams per day.
Other classes of antifungal agents in clinical use include inhibitors of ergosterol synthesis
("azole" antifungals including but not limited to fluconazole, ketoconazole, voriconazole, and
allylamines including but not limited to terbinafine), polyene antifungals which act by binding to
fungal membrane constituents, especially ergosterol (including but not limited to amphotericin B
or nystatin), echinocandin inhibtors of gluoan synthesis (including but not limited to
caspofungin), and other agents known as active antifungals in medical practice. Compounds of
the invention act via a distinct mechanism of action versus existing clinically important
antifungals and are optionally coadministered with one or more other antifungal agent to
improve overall antifungal treatment. Compounds of the invention are coadministered as
separate pharmaceutical formulations, or are optionally formulated into a single combined-drug
product. A combination of compounds of the inventions with azole antifungals is particularly
advantageous as a completely oral regimen for use against cyptoccoccosis, which otherwise
generally requires amphotericin B injections or infusions for intial induction. Compounds of the
invention are also optionally coadministered with amphotericin B. One formulation of
amphotericin B involves its incorporation into lipids comprising the membranes of liposomes.
Because many of the compounds of the invention bear lipophilic moieties that insert into lipid
membranes, they are advantageously incorporated into liposomes, either as single agents or in

This invention provides compounds that are useful for systemic treatment of cancer, based on
consistent lysosomal changes characterizing invasive cancers. Lysosomal changes in cancer,
including their enlargement and acidification, facilitates survival of cancer cells in acidic
extracellular environments and also increase the ability of cancer cells to invade surrounding
tissues, through exocytosis of lysosomal contents, including proteases and polysaccharidases
which can degrade extracellular matrix components. However, these stereotyped changes in
                                                  54

lysosomal properties can render cancer cells vulnerable to lysosome-disrupting agents with
appropriate physicochemical properties for selectively accumulating in and damaging lysosomes
in cancer cells versus normal tissues.
Compounds of the invention accumulate in lysosomes in cancer cells and disrupt their integrity,
thereby displaying potent selective cytotoxic activity against cancer cells in vivo and in vitro.
Because one major mechanism for cancer cell resistance to a variety of chemotherapy agents is
to sequester them in lysosomes and other acidic vesicular compartments, compounds of the
invention are able to restore or enhance sensitivity of cancer cells to a variety of classes of
anticancer agents, including antimetabolites, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, anticancer antibodies
against growth factor receptors, anthracyclines, platinum compounds, alkylating agents, and
antibodies. Compounds of the invention typically do not display toxicities overlapping dose
limiting toxicities of most anticancer agents, permitting combination of compounds of the
invention with other classes of antineoplastic drugs with a net improvement in efficacy and
therapeutic index.
Cancer cells exposed to sublethal doses of ionizing radiation undergo a protective response that
increases their resistance to subsequent irradiation. A component of this protective response is
formation of enlarged lysosomes or other acidified vacuolar organelles; inhibition of the vacuolar
ATPase responsible for acidifying lysosomes with bafilomycin A prevents the protective
response in sublethally irradiated cells and sensitizes cancer cells to ionizing radiation
Lysosomal damage is a significant mediator of radiation-induced death in cancer cells. By
disrupting the integrity of lysosomal membranes, compounds of the invention are useful for
reducing resistance of cancer cells to therapeutic ionizing radiation and for potentiating
anticancer effectiveness of ionizing radiation therapy.     Compounds of the invention are
optionally administered prior to ionizing radiation therapy of cancer (whether with external
irradiation or administration of antibody-targeted radioisotopes) as radiosensitizers, or they may
be given after irradiation to attack surviving cancer cells undergoing protective responses to
nonlethal irradiation involving production or enlargement of acidic vacuoles.

One mechanism imparting selective survival and proliferation advantages in some cancers is
upregulation of autophagy, a process through which damaged organelles or other cell debris are
engulfed by autophagosomes, which fuse with lysosomes to digest and recycle constituent
molecules. By concentrating in and disrupting lysosomes, compounds of the invention impair
autophagy in cancer cells, thereby reducing their viability and resistance to other anticancer
treatments.
For treatment of cancer, compounds of the invention are administered by oral or intravenous
administration in doses of 10 to 2000 milligrams per day. Compounds of the invention are
administered as single agents or in combination with other cancer treatments appropriate for a
particular type of cancer, and generally in doses when such agents are used alone, as compounds
of the invention will generally not have overlapping toxicities with other classes of anticancer
agents that would necessitate substantial dose reduction.
PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS
This invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a biologically active agent as
described herein and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Further embodiments of the
pharmaceutical composition of this invention comprise any one of the embodiments of the
biologically active agents described above. In the interest of avoiding unnecessary redundancy,
each such agent and group of agents is not being repeated, but they are incorporated into this
description of pharmaceutical compositions as if they were repeated.
Preferably the composition is adapted for oral administration, e.g. in the form of a tablet, coated
tablet, dragee, hard or soft gelatin capsule, solution, emulsion or suspension. In general the oral
composition will comprise from 10 to 1000 mg of the compound of this invention. It is
convenient for the subject to swallow one or two tablets, coated tablets, dragees, or gelatin
capsules per day. However the composition can also be adapted for administration by any other
conventional means of systemic administration including rectally, e.g. in the form of
suppositories, parenterally, e.g. in the form of injection solutions, or nasally.

The biologically active compounds can be processed with pharmaceutically inert, inorganic or
organic carriers for the production of pharmaceutical compositions. Lactose, corn starch or
derivatives thereof, talc, stearic acid or its salts and the like can be used, for example, as such
carriers for tablets, coated tablets, dragees and hard gelatin capsules. Suitable carriers for soft
gelatin capsules are, for example, vegetable oils, waxes, fats, semi-solid and liquid polyols and
the like. Depending on the nature of the active ingredient no carriers are, however, usually
required in the case of soft gelatin capsules, other than the soft gelatin itself. Suitable carriers for
the production of solutions and syrups are, for example, water, polyols, glycerol, vegetable oils
and the like. Suitable carriers for suppositories are, for example, natural or hardened oils, waxes,
fats, semi-liquid or liquid polyols and the like.
The pharmaceutical compositions can, moreover, contain preservatives, solubilizers, stabilizers,
wetting agents, emulsifiers, sweeteners, colorants, flavorants, salts for varying the osmotic
pressure, buffers, coating agents or antioxidants. They can also contain still other therapeutically
valuable substances, particularly anti-inflammatory or antifungal agents (depending on whether
an inflammatory disease or a fungal infection or cancer are being addressed in a patient) that act
through mechanisms other than those underlying the effects of the compounds of the invention.
For treatment of cancer, preferred additional drugs that can advantageously be coadministered or
coformulated with a compound of the invention comprise orally active anticancer agents.
Because compounds of the invention act through a unique mechanism not shared by other
anticancer drugs, they are compatible with a large variety of concurrent therapies, including
antimetabolites, anthracyclines, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, platinum drugs, or alkylating agents.
Such agents, when orally active, are administered or coformulated to deliver quantities of drugs
determined in previous clinical trials to be effective and adequately tolerated.
For systemic treatment of diseases, including some cancers, inflammatory conditions and fungal
or protozoal infections, compounds of the invention are optionally administered by intravenous
injection or infusion. For intravenous administration, compounds of the invention are dissolved
in suitable intravenous formulations as solutions or in lipid emulsions, using standard excipients
known in the art as well-tolerated intravenous formulation ingredients and compositions.

Suitable volumes and concentrations are selected for delivery of 10 to 2000 miligrams of
compounds of the invention per day, depending on the specific requirements for a compound,
and a disease condition as determined in clinical trials.
Compounds of the invention are optionally incorporated into liposomal formulations. The
lipophilic moieties of compounds of the invention permit their direct incorporation into lipid
layers of lipososomes. Liposomes are advantageous in some conditions for intravenous
administration due to improved efficacy and milder infusion reactions versus nonliposomal
formulations. Liposomes are also suitable for inhalational delivery to treat fungal or parasitic
infections of the lungs, or inflammation of the lungs and airways. In some embodiments,
compounds of the invention are incorporated into liposomal delivery formulations with other
drugs, including but not limited to antifungal agents such as liposomal amphotericin B, or
anticancer agents such as liposomal doxorubicin.
For treatment of inflammatory skin conditions or fungal infections of the skin or nails, or of
nasal passages, compounds of the invention are applied topically in a pharmaceutically
acceptable formulation. The topical composition can be in various forms, including, but not
limited to, a solution, spray, gel, hydrogel, lotion, cream, ointment, paste, or an emulsion in the
form of liquid suspension, lotion, or cream. The composition can also be applied via a dermal
patch, or bandage which can be applied on the affected area as needed, to provide an extended
exposure of the skin to the medication; in such formulations, appropriate standard topical
medicament excipients and vehicles are suitable for delivering compounds of the invention.
Standard constituents for topical formulations are known in the art and are suitable as vehciles
for compounds of the invention. Ointment bases can comprise one or more of hydrocarbons
(paraffin wax, soft paraffin, microcrystalline wax, or ceresine), absorption bases (wool fat or
beeswax), macrogols (polyethylene glycol), or vegetable oils. Lotions and creams are water in
oil or oil in water emulsions; the oil components can comprise long chain fatty acids, alcohols or
esters, and optional contain biocompatible nonionic surfactants, Compounds of the invention are
incorporated into topical vehicles in concentrations ranging from 0.01% to 5%, preferably 0.02
to 1%. Compounds of the invention are applied to skin lesions once to three times per day for
durations dependent on the rate of resolution of the condition.

For treatment of some lung infections, including fungal infections or parasites residing in
alveolar macrophages, inhalational formulas of compounds of the invention are suitable.
Excipients and inhalational drug delivery devices are known in the art and are useful for
delivering compounds of the invention to treat lung infections, including cryptococcus and
tuberculosis.
Compounds of the invention are advantageously coformulated with other antifungal or anti
inflammatory agents for topical or systemic administration, particularly when both drugs are
appropriately administered via the same route and schedule. Compounds of the invention are
compatible with standard formulations and excipients used for other topical or systemic
antifungal or anti-inflammatory agents, including but not limited to ointments and tablets or
capsules. Advantageous drug categories for combination in topical anti-inflammatoty
formulations include corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors and vitamin D analogues, and other
agents known to have independent therapeutic acitivity in inflammatory skin conditions.
The invention will be better understood by reference to the following examples, which illustrate
but do not limit the invention described herein.

BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITY EXAMPLES
ANTI-INFLAMMATORY EXAMPLES
EXAMPLE A: Selective killing of LPS-activated inflammatory macrophages by Compound AC.
Summary: THP- 1 is a human AML cell line that can be induced into a macrophage-like cell by
treatment with 0.2 pM vitamin-D3 (vit-D3) for 3-5 days. In the absence of an inflammatory
activator (LPS; bacterial endotoxin), AC exerted little effect on cell viability in THP-1 cells over
a 6 hour period. Similarly, LPS in the absence of AC induced only a low level of cell death. In
contrast, when both components, LPS and AC were added to vit-D3 activated THP- 1 cells,
massive cytotoxicity was observed within 6 hours. These observations indicate that stimulated
macrophages participating in an inflammatory reaction may be specifically targeted for
deactivation with AC.
Experiment Overview:
    1. Vit-D3 activated THP- 1 cells were transferred to the wells of a 24-well dish
    2. Compound AC, LPS from E.coli 0111:B4 or both components were added
    3. After 6 hours at 37C the wells viable cell counts were performed by FACS
Experimental procedures
Cell culture:
THP- 1 cells (ATCC) treated with 0.2 p M vitamin-D3 (EMD Biosciences) for 4 days prior to day
0 were transferred to the wells of 24-well dishes (1x106 cells in 1ml cRPMI [RPMI (ATCC) +
10% AFBS (ATCC)]. LPS from E.coli 0111:B4 (Sigma-Aldrich) and compound AC were added
to appropriate wells and the plates placed in a 37C incubator. After 6 hours the wells were
processed for Annexin V apoptosis assay.

FACS cell count and viability assay:
After 6 hours, 500      l of the cell suspension from each well was transferred to 3ml FACS tubes
and 50 p1 CountBright beads (Invitrogen) were added to each tube. Samples were vortexed, 2 P1
propidium iodide (150 riM) (Sigma-Aldrich) added then acquired on the FACSCalibur.
Results:
As shown in Table 1, in the absence of a second pro-inflammatory signal (LPS), AC exerted
little effect on cell viability in THP- 1 cells over a 6 hour period. Similarly, LPS in the absence
of AC induced only a low level of cell death. In marked contrast, when both LPS and AC were
added to vit-D3 activated THP-1 cells, massive cytotoxicity was observed within 6 hours.
Cytotoxicity increased in a AC dose-dependent manner.

0.1 to 2 pM, exerted little effect on cell viability in THP- 1 cells over a 6 hour period. Similarly,
LPS in the absence of AC induced a low level of cell death that increased in a dose dependent
manner. In contrast, when both components, LPS and AC, were added to vit-D3 activated THP

Conclusion:
AC selectively reduces viability of pro-inflammatory LPS-activated macrophages, with relative
sparing of nonstimulated macrophages. A very low dose of LPS (1 ng/ml) provided sufficient
activation of macrophages to make them susceptible to AC.
EXAMPLE B: Relative potency of Compound AC and chloroquine for inactivation of
inflammatory macrophages
Background: THP- 1 is a human AML cell line that can be induced into a macrophage-like cell
with vitamin-D3 (vit-D3) then activated into an inflammatory state by stimulation with LPS
(bacterial endotoxin). In the macrophage, LPS binding to toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4) leads to

NF-wB activation and secretion of inflammatory cytokines which can lead to tissue damage in
inflammatory diseases.
Compounds of the invention inactivate inflammatory macrophages by accumulating in acidic
vacuoles and disrupting their structure and function, inhibiting release of vesicular inflammatory
mediators and inducing cytosolic changes that trigger macrophage death or dysfunction,
including inhibition of autophagy; autophagy is important for differentiation of monocytes into
macrophages. The aim of this study was to compare relative potency of a compound of the
invention, AC, with chloroquine. Both AC and chloroquine are 4-aminoquinoline derivatives,
and chloroquine is known to be useful for treatment of several clinical inflammatory diseases.
In this experiment, cell viability was monitored and uptake and accumulation of acridine orange,
a lysosomotropic fluorescent dye, was used to assess lysosomal acidification and integrity. JC-1
dye was used to measure effects of test compounds on mitochondrial membrane potential
(MMP); reduction of MMP is a feature of apoptotic cell death.
Experimental procedures:
     1. Vit-D3 activated THP-1 cells (0.5x106 cells in 2 ml) were transferred to the wells of a 24
         well dish
    2. Compound AC was added at a concentration of 0.5 kM, 1.0 kM or 5.0 kM
    3. Chloroquine was added at a concentration of 25.0 kM, 50.0 kM or 100.0 kM
    4. LPS from E.coli 0111:B4 (1 ng/ml final concentration) was added to some wells
    5. After 5 hours viable cell count, Acridine Orange (A.O.) uptake and JC-1 mitochondrial
         loading were determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)

Acridine Orange (A.O.) uptake and viability cell count assay - 5 hour time point:
Samples were vortexed, 2 p1 of 50 pg/ml A.O. stock solution was added (200 ng/ml final) and
the tubes incubated at 37C for 15 minutes. The tubes were washed twice in DPBS, resuspended
in 500pl DPBS and acquired on the FACSCalibur. Acridine Orange exhibits strong fluorescence
in both FL-I (green - RNA binding) and FL-3 (far red - acidic lysosomes).
Results:
As shown in Table 3 below, in the absence of LPS, low doses of AC had low direct cytotoxic
effects that increased in a concentration dependent manner at the acute/ (5-hour) time point.
Chloroquine followed a similar trend though this required 100-fold more drug versus AC;
100pM Chloroquine was approximately equivalent to 1IM AC.
In the presence of a low dose of LPS (1 ng/ml), cytotoxicity was increased with addition of
0.1IM (100nM) AC. Addition of 10 pM, 50 pM or 100 pM Chloroquine had a smaller effect on
LPS-induced cell death than did 1 pM AC, indicating approximately 100x higher potency of AC
than chloroquine for inactivating LPS-stimulated as well as basal THP-1 cells.
Both AC and chloroquine reduced acridine orange fluorescence in THP- 1 cells primed with
vitamin D3 and activated with 0.1 ng/ml LPS (Table 4), indicating deacidification or disruption
of lysosomal integrity. AC was approximately 50x more potent than chloroquine for reducing
acridine orange fluorescence.
AC treatment led to a dose-dependent reduction in mitochondrial depolarization, resulting in a
decrease mitochondrial accumulation of red JC- 1 dimers.
LPS alone (1 ng/ml) had no effect on mitochondrial integrity but potentiated AC-induced
mitochondrial depolarization. In contrast Chloroquine had little or no direct effect on
mitochondrial integrity at concentrations up to 100pM in the absence or presence of LPS.

Conclusion:
AC displays selectivity for inactivating LPS-activated macrophages versus unstimulated cells.
AC also attenuated acridine orange accumulation in lysosomes, indicating that it caused
lysosomal disruption. AC was approximately 100 fold more potent than chloroquine for
inactivating macrophages, and about 50 times more potent than chloroquine for disrupting
lysosomal integrity as measured by acridine orange accumulation.
EXAMPLE C: Screen of compounds of the invention for anti-inflammatory activity in vitro
Background: THP- 1 is a human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell line that can be induced
into a macrophage-like cell with vitamin-D3 (vit-D3). In the macrophage, LPS
                                                 208

(lipopolysaccharide; endotoxin) stimulation of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4) leads to NF-KB
activation and secretion of inflammatory cytokines but also the priming of programmed death
pathways through RIP and Caspase 8. The balance of this complex regulatory network is
dependent on highly specific kinases, enzymes that require ATP. Disruption of either cytosolic
pH or ATP availability/energy level uncouples this control network and the can macrophage shift
away from production of inflammatory cytokines towards a programmed death event, which has
the net effect of limiting inflammatory damage.
Compounds of the invention have been shown to inactivate macrophages rapidly (within 5 to 6
hours) when the macrophages have been put into a pro-inflammatory state activated with LPS.
More than 200 compounds of the invention were screened for anti-inflammatory activity in the
THP-1 system to assess their relative potency and activity in vitro.
Summary:
Addition of LPS to compound-treated macrophages resulted in acute/5-hour cell death; this
activity increased in a concentration dependent manner. Treatment with test compounds alone
exhibited only a low level of acute cytotoxicity.
The majority of compounds tested displayed significant ability to inactivate pro-inflammatory
THP- 1 cells in accord with the proposed mechanism of action involving lysosome disruption,
which is not dependent upon binding to a specific protein target. Of the compounds tested, seven
demonstrated higher activity than the active benchmark compound AC: CJ, AM, AG, CX, AF,
BM and AH.
At the lowest concentration tested (0.1 pM), all seven tested compounds were more active than
AC in causing death of cells treated with LPS. At concentrations of 0.5 PM and above all
compounds, including AC, reached a maximum activity threshold.

Addition of LPS to test compound-treated macrophages resulted in massive acute/5-hour cell
death; this activity increased in a concentration dependent manner (Table 6). Treatment with
compounds alone without pro-inflammatory activation of the macrophages with LPS exhibited
only a low level of acute cytotoxicity.
At the lowest concentration tested (0.1 pM), seven compounds were more active than AC in
conditioning the cells for LPS-induced cell death. At concentrations of 0.5 PM and above, all
eight compounds, including AC, reached a maximum activity threshold.
Compound CX was the most effective cytotoxic compound at the acute/5-hour time point,
followed by a moderate activity group including CJ, AF, 30006 and BM. AG and AM exerted
the lowest effect on cytoplasmic conditioning, albeit still greater than that shown by AC.

EXAMPLE D: Anti-inflammatory activity of compounds of the invention
Compounds of the invention have been shown to directly inhibit NF-KB, damage intracellular
acidic lysosomes leading to proton leakage and acidification of the cytoplasm and also damage
mitochondria reducing the cellular energy level. Together these actions result in direct cell death
in some vulnerable cell types, over a period of about 48 hours. Additionally in the macrophage,
cytoplasmic acidification and energy depletion by compounds of the invention prime the cell for
inactivation when exposed to low concentrations of LPS, leading to an acute (5-hour) cell death
event through a combination of Caspase-driven apoptosis and RIP-driven necrosis.
Compounds of the invention were tested at 0.1 pM versus AC in the LPS-triggered THP-1 cell
death assay.     Both acute/5-hour and chronic/48-hour phases of cell death were assessed.
Compounds were screened in batches with DMSO as the negative control and AC as the high
activity control. Compounds were tested at the low concentration of 0.1 PM with a view toward
identifying agents more potent than the benchmark agent AC; at higher concentrations, e.g. 1
pM, most compounds of the invention are active in inducing cell death in this assay, which
makes differentiation from AC less clear than at a 10 fold lower drug concentration.
Results/Summary:
Seven of the compounds not only demonstrated equivalent activity to AC at the acute/5-hour
time point (cell conditioning) but were also more active than AC at the chronic/48-hour time
point (retention): CJ, AM, AG, CX, AF, BM and AH.
A further 15 tested compounds demonstrated equivalent activity to AC at both the 5-hour and
48-hour time points: CI, CL, AL, AR, AN, AD, BH, CV, AJ, BD, BU, BK, EW, AK and AE.
The remaining 187 compounds exhibited lower anti-inflammatory activity than AC at the tested
concentraction of 0.1 pM. However, this screen was conducted at a suboptimal concentration to
detect the most potent compounds in the library; low activity at a concentration of 0.1 mM in the
                                               211

context of this assay is still consistent with significant and potent anti-inflammatory activity
when compared to chloroquine or other antimalarials.

EXAMPLE E: Anti-inflammatory properties of Compound AC in a model of skin inflammation
Objective:   To evaluate the anti-inflammatory properties of compounds of the invention in a 12
O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) induced chronic skin inflammation mouse model.
Topically applied phorbol esters such as TPA induce skin inflammation involving edema,
macrophage and T cell infiltration and epidermal hyperplasia (Alford et al., 1992), and this
system has been used as an animal model for dermatitis, mimicking aspects of human
inflammatory skin disorders. TPA is also known as a tumor promoter, so that agents which
inhibit hyperproliferative or angiogenic actions of TPA may inhibit tumor promotion.
Methods
Drug formulations: Compound AC was dissolved in isopropyl myristate:propylene glycol (1:1)
+ 0.9% DMSO at the indicated concentrations. TPA was dissolved in acetone:water (99:1).
Dexamethasone (0.06%) was dissolved in normal saline.

Mice:   HSD-ICR(CD-1R) female mice at 8-10 weeks of age were used in this experiment.
Experimental Design: Mice were placed into six groups of 10 mice each. 20 [IL of 0.01% TPA
was administered to each ear on days 0, 2, 4, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 18, 20, and 22. 20 [tL of AC at
various concentrations or 20 [IL of dexamethasone solution was applied to the ears daily
beginning on day 7, after inflammatory changes in ear thickness were established. Ear thickness
was measured with calipers every three days.
Results
Compound AC treatment prevented inflammatory thickening of mouse ears treated with TPA.
Histology indicated that both TPA-induced edema and epidermal hyperplasia were reduced by
AC, as was angiogenesis. The potency of AC was comparable to that of dexamethasone, with
significant activity observed at the lowest dose of 12.5 micrograms of AC per ear per day.

Topical imiquimod (IMQ), a toll-like receptor agonist, has been established as a model of
Inflammatory skin diseases including psoriasis and atopic dermatitis. Dermal inflammatory
changes and gene expression in mice treated with topical imiquimod mimic human psoriasis and
dermatitis (van der Fits et al., 2009; Swindell et al., 2011). The effect of a set of compounds of
the invention were tested in a mouse model of imiquimod-induced dermatitis, with topical
tacrolimus and dexamethasone as comparators for assessing safety and efficacy relative to
standard agents used to treat dermatitis in humans.
Compounds to be tested for anti-inflammatory activity were individually dissolved in ethanol at
a concentration of 0.6% and then mixed with 9 volumes of petrolatum (melted on a heated water
bath at 50 degrees C), yielding ointments containing 0.06% active drug. Dexamethasone
ointment was prepared similarly, though at a final concentration of 0.03%, because 0.06%
dexamethasone applied topically in preliminary experiments had caused significant weight loss
due to systemic absorption. Commercial 0.1% tacrolimus ointment (ProTopic Tm ; Novartis) was
also used as an active comparator. Petrolatum containing 10% ethanol was used as a control
treatment.
Female Balb/C mice (8 weeks old) were randomized and divided into groups of 5 animals each.
Polyethylene collars were affixed to the mice to prevent them from easily scratching their ears.
5% imiquimod was applied to both ears of each mouse (20 microliters per ear) daily for 5 days,
and then every other day for the full duration of the study. Inflammatory changes, including a
doubling of ear thickness were apparent by day 5. On day 7 after initiation of imiquimod,
treatment with topical agents was started. Both ears of each mouse were treated with test
ointments, with one compound per mouse.
Ear thickness and PASI assessments (Psoriasis Area and Severity Index, a standard psoriasis
scoring system) were recorded twice per week throughout the study. The PASI score comprises
the sum of evaluations of swelling, erythema and scaling on scales from 0 to 4; the maximum
PASI score is 12, and the minimum, in unaffected skin, is 0).

Imiquimod treatment resulted in significant inflammatory changes, including an increase in ear
thickness and a change in PASI scores; control ears reached the maximum possible value in the
PASI scoring system, with severe thickening, erythema and scaling. Compounds of the
invention, applied topically in an ointment base, reduced imiquimod-induced inflammatory
damage to mouse ears, as assessed by caliper measurements of thickness and PASI scoring of
appearance. The comparator drugs tacrolimus and dexamethasone also reduced ear thickness
and PASI scores. Notably, AF was superior to the commercial clinical form of topical 0.1%
tacrolimus (Protopic ointment) in reducing ear thickness and PASI score. The anti-inflammatory
activity of dexamethasone was accompanied by significant loss of body weight, indicating
systemic toxicity due to dexamethasone absorption. Neither compounds of the invention nor
tacrolimus affected body weight. In addition to inducing inflammation of the ears imiquimod
transfer from the ears to the scalps of mice resulted in loss of hair and psoriasiform dermatitis on
the head, from between the ears, forward to the nose. In dexamethasone-treated mice, this area
remained hairless after treatment at the end of the experiment; in contrast, hair growth was
maintained in this area during daily treatment with AF, indicating that AF inhibited pathologic
inflammation without also impairing tissue normal tissue maintenance. A known side effect of
treatment with dexamethasone and other topical corticosteroids is thinning and weakening of the
treated areas; the lack of hair regrowth may reflect the clinical problem of skin atrophy known as
a side effect of topical dexamethasone. AF was equally effective at 0.06% and 0.6%
concentrations in the ointment base, indicating a wide therapeutic window. All of the tested
compounds of the invention reduced IMQ-induced changes in ear thickness, thus demonstrating
their anti-inflammatory activity in vivo.

EXAMPLE G: Effects of compounds of the invention in a mouse model of multiple sclerosis
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease mediated involving destruction by the immune
system of myelin sheaths surrounding neuron axons in the brain. An established animal model
for this disease is Experimental Autoiimune Encephalitis (EAE), induced by immunization of
mice with proteins or peptides that induce an immune response to myelin-specific proteins.
In this experiment, EAE was induced by immunization of mice with a peptide from proteolipid
protein (PLP), a known antigenic target in MS. Several compounds of the invention were
administered orally to assess their effect on the course of EAE, with quantitative evaluation of
disease symptoms as an endpoint. Linomide, a small molecule immunomodulator with known
activity in EAE models was used as a comparator drug.
Materials and Methods
41 mice received subcutaneous injections of 90 gg PLP139-151 in 200 gL of PBS on Day 0.
The PLP was prepared in incomplete Freund's adjuvant (IFA) by mixing 10 mL IFA with 40 mg
M. tuberculosis H37Ra (final concentration 4 mg/ml M. tuberculosis). The resulting mixture is
complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA).
For injection, an emulsion of PLP139-151 and CFA was prepared by mixing 1 mL of stock
solution with 1 mL of CFA while vortexing for 15 minutes to form an emulsion.
Mice received vehicle or a test compound (60 gmol/kg; suspended in 1% aqueous
hydroxypropylmethylcellulose) by oral gavage, three times per week for 2 weeks followed by
once daily treatment for 4 additional weeks, beginning on Day 14. Vials with vehicle and with
compounds were coded by letters (A-E) in order to obtain blind readings of disease severity.

aLimp   tail: complete flaccidity of the tail, and absence of curling at the tip of the tail when mouse
is picked up.
bHind limb weakness: observed as a waddling gait, the objective sign being that, in walking,
mouse's hind limbs fall through the wire cage tops.
'Partial hind limb paralysis: mouse can no longer use hind limbs to maintain rump posture or
walk but can still move one or both limbs to some extent.
dComplete hind limb paralysis: total loss of movement in hind limbs; mouse drags itself only on
its forelimbs. Mice at this stage are given food on the cage floor, long sipper tubes, and daily
subcutaneous saline injections to prevent death by dehydration.
Results:
Mice in all groups were displaying comparable mild EAE disease symptoms by day 14 after PLP
injection, at which time oral treatment with the test agents was initiated. At the termination of
the study, on Day 46, Vehicle-treated mice displayed more severe disease symptom scores than
did the treatment groups. Compounds of the invention displayed protective activity comparable
to the positive control compound linomide.

Experiment overview:
A single colony of CandidaAlbicans was grown in 50 ml YPD broth overnight (19 hr). The cells
were washed with PBS and 3.5x104 CFU/ml of C. Albicans (144        1tl/well) in YPD medium were
plated in 96 well plates. Test compounds were then added to each well with concentration ranged
from 5 to 40 [tM as final concentrations. The plates were incubated at 30'C overnight (24 hrs)
and OD at 600nm was read at the end of incubation as an index of yeast cell density.
Results:
Most of the compounds tested showed inhibition of Candida growth.. Based on inhibition curves,
IC50 (50% inhibition of fungal growth) and MIC (99% of inhibition of fungal growth) values of
compounds were calculated using XLfit and listed in the following table. The compounds with
higher antifungal activity have the lower numerical values.

Experiment overview:
Trichophyton grown on two agar plates were collected by scraping into 10 ml saline and filtered
through 8 pm filters. The filtered solution was diluted (1:75) and plated in 96 well plates and
treated with selected compounds of the invention.
Results:
This experiment included some active compounds from previous experiment and added several
untested compounds. Culture treated by compounds AW, AX, AT, AE or AH showed no visible
fungal grow with even the lowest concentration (6pM) tested, representing their strongest
inhibitory effect against trichophyton growth. Most of rest compounds also inhibited fungal
growth with higher concentration (12-18 riM). AO, AP, AF, BL, AQ and BO showed only
partial or no inhibition on fungal grow with highest concentration (40PM) tested. Following
table listed the maximum inhibition concentration (MIC) based on scoring by eye.

Experiment overview:
Cryptococcus neoformans (serotype D) were plated in 96 well plates with 144 [[1/well of 8 x10e5
CFU/ml in YM growth medium. Diluted compounds were then added to each well with
concentration ranged from 4 to 60 [tM as final concentration in duplicates. The plates were
inoculated at 37'C for total of 48 hours. Two readings of OD at 600nm were measured after 30
and 48 hour treatments.
Results:
Most compounds tested in this assay inhibited the growth of Cryptococcus, with compounds AL,
AG, AW, AX, AA, AE, AH, AK, BM, and BN as the most effective ones. It is noteworthy that
compounds AA and AC were quite active against Cryptococcus, comparing with their relative
weak activities against Candida and S. cereviseae. Overall it seems that Cryptococcus is more
susceptible to compounds of the invention than the other fungi tested. Chloroquine had very
weak activity against Cryptococcus, with a maximum growth inhibition of 40% at a
concentration of 100 micromolar, so that its IC50 is greater than this concentration. IC5 0
(concentration for 50% of inhibition) and MIC (concentration for maximum-99% of inhibition)
were calculated using XLfit based on OD of 48 hour reading are listed in the following table.

EXAMPLE M: Effects of compounds of the Invention on THP-1-derived macrophage
antifungal activity; Development of a phagocytosed Cryptococcus neoformans antifungal screen
Background: In the preceding examples compounds have been shown to possess direct anti
fungal activity against Cryptococcus neoformans at concentrations less than 5 PM. The
compounds, being weak bases, are lysosomotropic, concentrating in the acidic lysosomal
compartment of macrophages. Some pathogenic fungi, such as Cryptococcus neoformans, reside
in acidic lysosomes of macrophages in an effort to avoid the host immune system (Srikanta et al.,
2011.
                                                    240

     WO 2014/120995                                                        PCT/US2014/013992
Another lysosomotropic drug, chloroquine, which has some direct anti-fungal activity at the
much higher concentration of 100kM in C. neoformans, has been shown to enhance anti-fungal
activity of macrophages against C. neoformans when tested at only 10 kM. This effect was
shown to be due to the drug concentrating in lysosomes housing the yeast (Harrison et al., 2000)
The potential therefore exists for compounds of the invention to behave in a manner similar to
chloroquine for attacking Cryptococcus or other organisms residing in macrophages, but at much
lower concentrations.
Results/Summary:
The compounds tested (AM, BM, AH and AC) all showed clear dose dependent inhibition of
fungal growth after phagocytosis and lysis. AH showed the highest potency with near 100%
inhibition of the fungal growth at 2kM.
The IC50 values after macrophage phagocytosis were comparable to the IC50 values for direct
inhibition of fungal growth, in the absence of macrophages reported in an earlier study.
The compounds were capable of killing C. neoformans (serotype A) even when the fungus was
located within live macrophages.

20ml YPD broth at 30C overnight. Absorbance of 1:10 dilution of the overnight (ON) culture
gave 0.89 OD at 600nm. Estimated concentration of this stock was 4x108 cells/ml (2x108
cells/ml gave an OD 600nm of 0.426 in an earlier study Cryptococcus macrophage development
plate 3 ML1 13012). The cells were washed with DPBS once and resuspended in 2ml DPBS. 230
  l of this stock (-60x10 7 cells) was brought up to 500 l with DPBS in an Eppendorf tube. For
opsonization, 500 p1 of human serum (SIGMA S7023) was added and the tube incubated at 30 C
for 60 mins with orbital shaking. The opsonized fungal cells were washed three times with 800I1
DPBS (1,100g for 2 min) and resuspended in 800pl DPBS. A 1:200 dilution of cells was counted
(4.25x10 6/ml), equivalent to 8.5x108/ml for the IX stock. 470 P1 of the IX stock was brought up
tolOml with cRPMI for a final concentration of 4x10 7/ml.

Media was aspirated from the prepared macrophage plate and 100I of the opsonized fungal cell
suspension added to the wells. Media without yeast was added to triplicate wells for each
macrophage concentration to provide background readings. Three empty wells (no macrophages)
were seeded with fungus to serve as the wash control. The plates were then incubated at 37 C for
4 hours then washed 4 times with DPBS (plates were shakes briefly after addition of DPBS to
increase wash efficiency). 144 l of cRPMI was added to each well and 6I1 of 12.5 PM, 25 PM
and 50 pM stocks of compounds AM, BM, AH, and AC added in triplicate for final
concentrations of 0.5 pM, 1IM or 2 pM. The plate was incubated at 37 C, 5% C02 for 18 hours.
Media was removed, 25pl of 0.05% Triton X-100 (SIGMA T-9284) in DPBS was added to each
well and the plate rocked at RT for 3 min, to lyse the cells. 125 I YPD broth (KD Medical
YLF-3260) was then added to each well and the plate placed in a 30C incubator. C. neoformans
cell growth was determined by measuring absorbance at 600nm on a Spectrophotometer (Spectra
Max Plus using program SoftMax Pro) after 30 hours.
EXAMPLE N: Antifungal Activity as Determined by Minimum Inhibitory and Fungicidal
Concentrations
OBJECTIVE
The objective of this study was to determine the antifungal activity of eight experimental
compounds against a representative panel of fungal isolates, including Candida albicans, C.
glabrata,Cryptococcus neoformans, Trichophyton rubrum,Aspergillusfumigatus, and Rhizopus
spp. Antifungal activity was measured by minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and
minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC).
MATERIALS
Isolates
Three recent clinical strains of each species, taken from the culture collection at the Center for
Medical Mycology, Case Western University, were tested.

Antifungal Agents
Compounds in powder form were dissolved in DMSO. Serial dilutions of each compound were
then prepared in RPMI-1640 in a range of 0.125-64 pig/ml.
METHODS
MIC testing was performed according to the CLSI M27-A3 and M38-A2 standards for the
susceptibility testing of yeasts and filamentous fungi, respectively (1, 2). Test isolates were
subcultured from frozen slants onto potato dextrose agar plates (Trichophyton rubrum was
subcultured onto oatmeal plates for conidia production) and checked for purity. Inocula were
then prepared in RPMI-1640 (YNB for Cryptococcus) to a concentration of 0.5 - 2.5 x 103
colony-forming units (CFU)/ml or 0.4 - 5 x 104 conidia/ml for yeast and filamentous fungi,
respectively. MIC endpoints were read at 50% and 100% inhibition, as compared to the growth
control, at both 24 and 48 hrs (C. neoformans were incubated for 72 hrs and T. rubrum strains
were incubated for 96 hrs).
MFC determinations were performed according to the modifications previously described by
Canton et al. and Ghannoum and Isham. (3, 4) Specifically, the total contents of each clear well
from the MIC assay were subcultured onto potato dextrose agar. To avoid antifungal carryover,
the aliquots were allowed to soak into the agar and then were streaked for isolation once dry,
thus removing the cells from the drug source.     Fungicidal activity was defined as a > 99.9%
reduction in the number of colony forming units (CFU)/ml from the starting inoculum count,
with compounds being determined as cidal if the MFC fell within 4 dilutions of the MIC.
RESULTS
The data shows that all eight compounds demonstrated antifungal activity against the strains
tested, although MIC and MFC results were strain specific. As can be seen in Table 27,
compound AC showed the lowest MIC values against the C. albicans strains at both the 50% and
100% inhibition at 24 hrs (<0. 12-0.25 and <0.12-1 [tg/ml, respectively) and 48 hrs (<0.12-1
                                                 245

       WO 2014/120995                                                          PCT/US2014/013992
 and 0.5-2 jig/ml, respectively). Importantly, compound AC was cidal against 2 of the 3 C.
 albicans strains tested. Compound AG demonstrated similar MIC and MFC values against the C.
 albicans strains.
 Table 28 shows that compounds AG and AC were also the most active against the C. glabrata
 strains tested. After 24 hrs, the MIC at 50% for compound AG was 0.25-1 jig/ml and 0.5-2 at
 100%. After 48 hrs, the corresponding compound AG values were both 0.5-2 jig/ml. After 24
 hrs, the MIC at 50% for compound AC was 0.5-1 jig/ml and 1-2 at 100%. After 48 hrs, the
 corresponding compound AC values were 1-2 (50%) and 2-4 jig/ml (100%). Both compounds
 AG and AC were cidal against all of the C. glabrata strains tested.
 As can be seen in Table 29, compounds AX and AH demonstrated the greatest antifungal activity
 against the Cryptococcus neoformans strains tested. Compound AX had MIC values of 0.12-2
 and 0.5-4 jig/ml at 50% and 100% inhibition, respectively, while compound AH had
 corresponding values of 0.004-2 and 0.25-2 jig/ml. Both compounds were cidal against all 3
 neoformans isolates.
 Table 30 shows the MIC and MFC values of the eight compounds against the Aspergillus
fumigatus strains. Compounds AE, AH, and AC showed equivalent inhibitory activity, with
 compound AE demonstrating MIC values of <0. 12-0.5 and <0.12-1 pig/ml at 50% and 100%
 inhibition, respectively, after 24 hrs. After 48 hrs, the corresponding values for compound AE
 were 0.5-2 and 1-4 jig/ml. Compound AH demonstrated MIC values of <0.12 and 0.25-0.5 pig/ml
 at 50% and 100% inhibition, respectively, after 24 hrs. After 48 hrs, the corresponding values for
 compound AH were 0.25-1 and 0.25-4 pig/ml. For compound AC, the MIC values at 24 hrs were
 <0.12 and 0.25-0.5 jig/ml for 50% and 100% inhibition, respectively, while the corresponding
 values at 48 hrs were 0.5-1 and 1 [tg/ml. However, only compounds AL, AM, and AG were cidal
 against one of the A. fumigatus strains (MRL 28397).
 In Table 31, it can be seen that compounds AE, AH, and AC were the most active against the
Rhizopus strains. At 24 hrs, compound AE showed MIC values of <0.12 and 1-2 [tg/ml for 50%
                                                   246

     WO 2014/120995                                                         PCT/US2014/013992
and 100% inhibition, respectively, with corresponding 48 hr values of 1-2 and 1-4 ig/ml.
Compound AH showed MIC values of 0.25-0.5 and 2 pig/ml for 50% and 100% inhibition,
respectively, at 24 hrs and 2 ig/ml for both endpoint readings at 48 hrs. At 24 hrs, compound AC
showed MIC values of <0.12-0.25 and 0.5 pig/ml for 50% and 100% inhibition, respectively,
with corresponding 48 hr values of 0.5 and 0.5-1 ig/ml. Generally, no cidal activity was
demonstrated against the Rhizopus strains tested.
Finally, Table 32 shows the MIC and MFC values of the eight compound against T. rubrum. At
the 50% inhibition endpoint, compounds AG, AX, AE, AH, and AC showed equivalent activity
(<0.12-4 ig/ml overall). At the 100% inhibition endpoint, compounds AG, AH, and AC were
equivalent (0.25-4 ig/ml overall), with compounds AX and AE ranging slightly higher (0.25-16
 ig/ml). Within the definition of cidality (MFC within 4 dilutions of the MIC) all compounds
were considered cidal against the T. rubrum strains, though the MFC were high in some strains
(8-16 pig/ml).
Overall, compounds AE, AH, and AC appeared to demonstrate the greatest inhibitory activity
against the most fungal strains tested.

ANTICANCER EXAMPLES
EXAMPLE 0: Compounds of the invention inhibit syngeneic breast cancer growth in mice
Cancer models in mice generally either involve syngeneic murine tumors in immunocompetent
mice or xenografts of human tumors in immunocompromised mice. An important aspect of
using murine tumors in mice is that the tumor and host have much closer genetic similarity than
do human xenografts in mice and therefore can be a very rigorous test of selectivity of agents for
inhibiting proliferation of cancer cells versus normal tissues. 4T1 is breast cancer cell line
commonly used as a syngeneic cancer model. Test compounds were chosen based upon their
ability to selectively to kill 4T1 mouse mammary breast cancer cells relative to a normal mouse
mammary cell line in vitro.
Female Balb/C mice were randomized into treatment groups andl0 3 4T1 cells were injected into
into the mammary fat pad of each mouse in 0. 1mL PBS on 4/28/10 (day 0). Mice received test
compounds by oral gavage in 1% hydroxypropylmethylcellulose from day 2 until day 30. Tumor
growth was assessed by caliper measurements twice per week and tumor weight after necropsy,
and body weight was also monitored.
Treatment groups were:

Compounds of the invention reduced tumor growth versus vehicle-treated mice after daily oral
administration at a dose of 120 [tM/kg/day for 33 days, with acceptable toxicity (less than 10%
body weight loss). CQ was the most active of the compounds tested in this experiment in the
4T1 breast cancer model. Compounds were chosen for in vivo testing based upon their ability to
selectively to kill 4T1 mouse mammary breast cancer cells relative to a normal mouse mammary
cell line in vitro, indicating a correspondence between in vitro cancer cell line cytotoxicity in
vivo anticancer activity of compounds of the invention.
EXAMPLE P: Effects of Compound AC in mice bearing xenografts of human hormone
independent prostate cancer
Experimental procedure
Standard models for prostate cancer use subcutaneous xenografts of human prostate cancer cell
line. Local measurable tumors are produced at the site of injection of the cells, and they
metastasize to critical tissues such as the bones, lungs and liver. Mortality in this model is due to

10 female nude mice (female Hsd:athymic nude-Foxnlu) received PC-3 cells (5x10 6 per mouse
in 0. 1mL PBS) by subcutaneous injection into the right hind flank. After 8 days tumors were
palpable and mice were divided into two groups with approximately equal mean tumor sizes.
Mice received AC or vehicle (saline) via intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection once daily until day 79.
     1. Vehicle (0.9 % saline): Mean pretreatment tumor volume 55.7 mm 3 ; body weight 26.6
        0.9 g)
    2. Compound AC: 120 [tmol/kg/day. Mean pretreatment tumor volume 59.6 mm 3 ; body
        weight 26.8  0.5 g)
Tumors were measured with calipers twice per week, and body weights and mortality were also
monitored.
Results
All 5 vehicle-treated mice died by day 35 (Individual days of death 20, 24, 24, 26, and 35). One
mouse in the AC-treated group died on day 65 and the remaining 4 survived until the study was
terminated on day 79.
In the longest-surviving vehicle-treated mouse, the tumor volume was 3007% larger at time of
death on day 35 than at initiation of treatment; all other vehicle-treated animals died of
metastatic disease with smaller primary tumor sizes. Among mice treated with AC, tumors had
enlarged to an average of 949 % of initial size at day 77; two of the mice surviving to the end of
the study had no detectable tumors at that time and were deemed complete regressions, and one
regressed more than 50% from the initial tumor size. AC-treated mice had a mean body weight
of 28.9  1.3 g at end of study; a weight gain rather than a weight loss from the initial group
body weight of 26.8  0.5 g indicates that the treatment was well tolerated. Daily injections of
AC therefore markedly improved survival and decreased tumor size, including producing
complete and partial regressions, in mice bearing hormone-independent prostate cancers.

EXAMPLE      Q: Effects  of compounds of the invention in a mouse model of liver metastases of
human colorectal cancer
A major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with colorectal cancer is metastasis of the
tumor into the liver; colorectal cancer can often be successfully resected from the primary site,
but metastases to the liver are much less accessible to surgical treatment. A mouse model of
colorectal cancer metastasis to the liver has been established, using HCT- 116 colon
adenocarcinoma cells injected into the spleen of athymic (nude) mice. The HCT- 116 cancer
cells spontaneously spread from the spleen into the liver via the circulation, and they form
tumors in the liver (Ishizu, K., Sunose, N., Yamazaki, K., Tsuruo, T., Sadahiro, S., Makuuchi,
H., and Yamori, T. Development and Characterization of a Model of Liver Metastasis Using
Human Colon Cancer HCT- 116. Biol. Pharm. Bull. 2007, 30(9):1779-1783).
Compounds CQ and AA were tested for antitumor activity in the HCT- 116 model of metastatic
colorectal cancer.
Methods:
Mice (female Hsd:athymic nude-FoxnlU) were anesthetized with xylazine/ketamine
intraperitoneal injection, followed by incision approximately 10mm on the left subcostal region
(area disinfected with ethanol) to expose the peritoneum. The peritoneum was opened for about
8mm near the spleen, and 2.5x106 cells in 50 [tL PBS were injected into the spleen using a 30G
needle. The spleen was repositioned, and the surgical area was closed using sutures and clips.

The day after receiving cells, mice were randomized into groups of five based upon body weight
to provide groups with approximately equivalent mean body weight. Mice received a single,
daily oral dose of test article or vehicle (1% hydroxypropylmethylcellulose) beginning 48 hours
following cell injection into the spleen.
At study termination 28 days after HCT- 116 cell injection, body weights were recorded, and
spleens and livers were removed, weighed and fixed in 10% formalin. Livers were sectioned and
stained; the relative areas of normal and tumor tissue were quantified in histology sections with
quantitative planimetry software.
Results:
Tumors in the Vehicle control group occupied 14% of the liver as assessed by quantitative
planimetry in histology sections. Both compounds CQ and AC markedly reduced the area of
liver invaded by metastatic cancer cells. The Vehicle group had a 12% higher liver weight/body
weight ratio than the groups treated with either CQ or AC, corroborating the histology
planimetry measurements indicating that tumors increased the total liver mass in the Vehicle
group. Body weights were not significantly different between groups of mice treated with
vehicle-treated versus test compounds, indicating that the compounds of the invention were well
tolerated at a dose of 240 [tmol/kg/day for 28 days.

EXAMPLE R: Effects of compounds of the invention, sorafenib, and combinations in a mouse
model of human hepatocellular carcinoma
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common and lethal cancers worldwide,
generally developing as a consequence of chronic infection with hepatitis B or C viruses. The
tyrosine kinase inhibitor sorafenib is a multikinase inhibitor used for treatment of advanced
HCC, and has both direct antitumor and antiangiogenic properties. Compounds of the invention
act via a different mechanism of action than does sorafenib or other kinase inhibitors; therefore it
is possible that compounds of the invention, in addition to displaying single agent activity, may
also enhance the efficacy of sorafenib or other standard treatments in HCC and other cancers.
The Hep3B hepatocellular carcinoma cell line is human in origin, contains genetic traces of
hepatitis B virus, and can be injected into the livers of athymic immunocompromised mice as a
model of primary HCC. Oral sorafenib is active in this model and was used as both a positive
control treatment and as a partner for combination therapy with a selection of compounds of the
invention. The test compounds were all administered orally.
Methods:
The test compounds of the invention were suspended in 1% hydroxypropylmethylcellulose
(HPMC) using a sonicator equipped with a microtip to minimize particle size and maximize
uniformity of the suspension. Sorafenib was dissolved in a 1:1 mixture of Cremophor EL and
ethanol by heating to 60'C for 1 minute and then sonicating for 10 minutes to fully suspend.
Female nude mice (Hsd:athymic nude-Foxnlnu) weighing approximately 25 g were anesthetized
with ketamine/xylazine, laid on their backs, and a 1-cm transverse incision made through the
skin and peritoneum of the left upper abdomen. The mediant lobe of the liver was exposed by
applying gentle pressure on the abdomen. 1.5-2x106 Hep3B cells in a 20[tL volume of
matrigel:EMEM serum free (1:1) were slowly implanted by subserosal injection into the liver
using a 27-gauge needle on a Hamilton syringe. The liver was allowed to slip back into place,
and the peritoneum was closed with sutures and wound clips.

Mice were divided into 8 groups of mice each following injection of cells; the vehicle/vehicle
group comprised 12 mice and the other groups comprised 8 or 9. Mice began receiving oral
testdrug treatments 48hr post cell injection.

The test compounds, sorafenib, and vehicles were administered by oral gavage. Sorafenib or its
cremophor-containing vehicle were given in the morning and compounds of the invention or
their HPMC vehicle was administered in the afternoon each day; all animals received two gavage
treatments of drugs or appropriate vehicles daily. In the group with sorafenib as the only active
test agent, the daily dose was 30 mg/kg; when combined with compounds of the invention, the
sorafenib dose was reduced to 20 mg/kg because the tolerability of the combination was
unknown, and also because possible improved anticancer activity of compounds of the invention

combined with a lower dose of sorafenib over a higher dose of sorafenib alone would more
clearly demonstrate advantageous activity of compounds of the invention.
Mice were sacrificed at day 35 after 2 of the initial 12 vehicle-treated mice had died from tumor
progression; livers were removed and photographed, and tumors were dissected out for
measurement and weighing.
Results
All vehicle-treated mice developed tumors, with a mean weight of about 2 grams at the time of
sacrifice. Sorafenib (30 mg/kg/day) as a single agent reduced the tumor size by more than 50%.
Compounds AC and AB alone also reduced tumor size by more than 50%; AK alone produced a
numerically but not statistically significant reduction in tumor size versus vehicle. Addition of
sorafenib (20 mg/kg/day) to compounds of the invention resulted in better inhibition of tumor
growth than was achieved with sorafenib alone at 30 mg/kg/day. The combinations of DD or
AB with sorafenib produced more complete regressions (no viable tumor detected at necropsy)
than single-agent treatments. All treatments including combinations were well-tolerated as
indicated by maintenance of body weight throughout the entire duration of the study.

Compounds of the invention were screened for ability to kill or inhibit proliferation of cancer
cell lines in vitro, as a complement to in vivo studies on subsets of compounds demonstrating
anticancer efficacy in vivo, at doses that were well tolerated after either oral or intraperitoneal
administration.
Anticancer activity against 4T1 murine breast cancer cells cancer cells was assessed in vitro by
seeding 1x104 cells/well in flat bottom culture plates, then treating with selected 1 [tM or 5 tM
concentrations of compounds for 18hr after plating. Then 10 [tL of Wstl dye reagent, a

tetrazolium dye indicator for cell death, was added/well and incubated approximately 2hr before
being assayed on the Biotek EL800 Universal microplate reader (450nm, reference 630nm).
Activity against PC3 human prostate cancer cells in vitro was assessed by a similar method.
PC-3 prostate cancer cells were plated at 2x10 4 cells/well in 96 well flat bottom tissue culture
plates, and incubated for approximately 20 hours with vehicle or test compounds at
concentrations of 0.4, 0.5 or 2.5 [tM as indicated for specific compounds in the right-hand column
of Table 37. A 1/10h volume of Wstl dye was added/well and incubated for two hours in the cell
culture incubator. Samples were analyzed in triplicate on an EL800 Universal Microplate Reader
at 450nm, reference wavelength 630nm.
Numerical values in the Table 37 represent percent of cancer cell survival relative to vehicle
treated cells at the indicated concentrations, with values under 100 indicating anticancer cytotoxic
activity at the drugs concentrations tested.

EXAMPLE T: Effects of compounds of the invention of resistance of human prostate cancer
cells to cytotoxic chemotherapy agents in vitro
Cancer therapy is hindered by inherent or acquired resistance of tumor to single cytotoxic
anticancer agents. One mechanism of cancer cell resistance to chemotherapy agents such as
anthracylines, platinum compounds, vinca alkaloids, taxanes, and some tyrosine kinase
inhibitors, is to sequester anticancer agents in lysosomes or related acidic vacuoles. Compounds
of the invention were tested in vitro for their ability to increase sensitivity to several other classes
of anticancer agents to which PC-3 prostate cancer cells are relatively resitant in vitro and in
vivo.
PC-3 prostate cancer cells were plated at 2x10 4 cells/well in 96 well flat bottom tissue culture
plates, and incubated approximately 20 hours. Cells were treated with an anticipated suboptimal
concentration of test compounds for cell killing as a single agent for approximately 30 minutes.
Chemotherapeutic agents (doxorubicin, oxaliplatin, paclitaxel or vincristine at concentrations
suboptimal for PC-3 cell killing) were added and PC-3 cells were incubated for an additional 72
hours before being assayed using Wstl reagent. A 1/10w volume of Wstl dye was added/well
and incubated for two hours in the cell culture incubator. Samples were analyzed in triplicate on
an EL800 Universal Microplate Reader at 450nm, reference wavelength 630 nm.
In Table 38, numerical values in the column headed "No Chemo" represent percent cell survival
after exposure to the compounds of the invention at concentrations indicated to the left of that
column. In the columns headed by the names of the four chemotherapeutic agents, values lower
than the corresponding "No Chemo" values indicate better anticancer activity of the specific
combination of the cytotoxic agent in combination with a compound of the invention than was
obtained with either class of compound alone. At the concentrations indicated, the minimal
                                                  263

activity of the chemotherapy agents alone during 72 hours of exposure was normalized to 100%
for clarity in discerning synergistic or additive effects of compounds of the invention. The
results indicate that, at the concentrations tested, a broad range of compounds of the invention
increase sensitivity of cancer cells to one or more of the tested cytotoxic chemotherapy agents
doxorubicin, oxaliplatin, paclitaxel or vincristine.
