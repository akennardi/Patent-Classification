CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION
[0001]      This application is a divisional of Australian Patent Application No. <removed-apn>, filed
10 November 2016, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.
[0001a]     The parent of this application claims the benefit of and priority to U.S. Provisional
Application Serial No. 62/256,509, filed on November 17, 2015, the entire contents of which are
incorporated herein by reference.
BACKGROUND
1.      Technical Field
[0002]      The present disclosure relates to systems, methods, and devices for placing an ablation
antenna using ultrasound image guidance.
2.      Discussion of Related Art
[0003]      When planning a treatment procedure, clinicians often rely on patient data including X
ray data, computed tomography (CT) scan data, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data, or other
imaging data that allows the clinician to view the internal anatomy of a patient.       The clinician
utilizes the patient data to identify targets of interest and to develop strategies for accessing the
targets of interest for the surgical procedure.
[0004]      The use of CT images as a diagnostic tool has become routine and CT results are
frequently the primary source of information available to a clinician regarding the size and location
of a lesion, tumor or other similar target of interest. This information is used by the clinician for
planning an operative procedure such as a biopsy or an ablation procedure, but is only available as
"offline" information which must typically be memorized to the best of the clinician's ability prior
to beginning a procedure.

                                                     2
During a CT scan, a patient is digitally imaged and a CT image data volume is assembled. The CT
image data may then be viewed by the clinician each of the axial, coronal and sagittal directions. A
clinician reviews the CT image data slice by slice from each direction when attempting to identify or
locate a target. It is often difficult, however, for the clinician to effectively plan a surgical ablation
procedure based on the X-rays, CT images, or MRIs in their raw form.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
10040]      The present disclosure provides a system and method for planning and performing
microwave ablation surgical treatment. The system presents a clinician with a streamlined method
of treatment planning from the initial patient selection through a process of target identification and
selection, target sizing, treatment zone sizing, entry point and route selection to create a pathway to
the target, and treatment plan review. The treatment plan may then be used as a guide during the
performance of the surgical procedure, where the system is configured to track the position of
surgical tools inside the patient and give the clinician a real-time view of the position of the tools in
relation to the target and the pre-planned pathway toward the target. The system also presents a
clinician with the capability to compare and contrast pre-operative and post-operative CT image data
to assess the outcome of a surgical treatment procedure that has been performed.
10041]      Although the present disclosure will be described in terms of specific illustrative
embodiments, it will be readily apparent to those skilled in this art that various modifications,
rearrangements and substitutions may be made without departing from the spirit of the present
disclosure. The scope of the present disclosure is defined by the claims appended hereto.
10042]      Microwave ablation treatment, according to the present disclosure, is generally divided
into two phases: (1) a planning phase, and (2) a procedure phase. The planning phase of microwave
ablation treatment is more fully described in co-pending patent application number 14/821,950
entitled TREATMENT PROCEDURE PLANNING SYSTEM AND METHOD, filed on August 11,
2014 by Bharadwaj et al., the contents of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.
The alternative planning and a procedure phase are more fully described below.
10043]      A microwave ablation planning and procedure system according to the present disclosure
may be a unitary system configured to perform both the planning phase and the procedure phase, or
the system may include separate devices and software programs for the various phases. An example
of the latter may be a system wherein a first computing device with one or more specialized

                                                   7
software programs is used during the planning phase, and a second computing device with one or
more specialized software programs may import data from the first computing device to be used
during the procedure phase.
10044]      Referring now to FIG. 1, the present disclosure is generally directed to a treatment
system 10, which includes a computing device 100, a display 110, a table 120, an ablation probe
130, an ultrasound imager 140, and an ultrasound workstation 150. Computing device 100 may be,
for example, a laptop computer, desktop computer, tablet computer, or other similar device.
Computing device 100 may be configured to control an electrosurgical generator, a peristaltic pump,
a power supply, and/or any other accessories and peripheral devices relating to, or forming part of,
system 10. Display 110 is configured to output instructions, images, and messages relating to the
performance of the microwave ablation procedure. Table 120 may be, for example, an operating
table or other table suitable for use during a surgical procedure, which includes an electromagnetic
(EM) field generator 121.      EM field generator 121 is used to generate an EM field during the
microwave ablation procedure and forms part of an EM tracking system which is used to track the
positions of surgical instruments within the body of a patient. EM field generator 121 may include
various components, such as a specially designed pad to be placed under, or integrated into, an
operating table or patient bed.     An example of such an EM tracking system is the AURORATM
system sold by Northern Digital Inc.        Ablation probe 130 is a surgical instrument having a
microwave ablation antenna which is used to ablate tissue. While the present disclosure describes
the use of system 10 in a surgical environment, it is also envisioned that some or all of the
components of system 10 may be used in alternative settings, for example, an imaging laboratory
and/or an office setting.
10045]      In addition to the EM tracking system, the surgical instruments may also be visualized by
using ultrasound imaging.      Ultrasound imager 140, such as an ultrasound wand, may be used to
image the patient's body during the microwave ablation procedure to visualize the location of the
surgical instruments, such as ablation probe 130, inside the patient's body. Ultrasound imager 140
may have an EM tracking sensor embedded within or attached to the ultrasound wand, for example,
a clip-on sensor or a sticker sensor. As described further below, ultrasound imager 140 may be
positioned in relation to ablation probe 130 such that ablation probe 130 is at an angle to the
ultrasound image plane, thereby enabling the clinician to visualize the spatial relationship of
ablation probe 130 with the ultrasound image plane and with objects being imaged. Further, the EM

                                                   8
tracking system may also track the location of ultrasound imager 140. In some embodiments, one or
more ultrasound sensors 140 may be placed inside the body of the patient. EM tracking system may
then track the location of such ultrasound sensors 140 and ablation probe 130 inside the body of the
patient.
10046]       Various other surgical instruments or surgical tools, such as ligasure devices, surgical
staples, etc., may also be used during the performance of a microwave ablation treatment procedure.
Ablation probe 130 is used to ablate a lesion or tumor (hereinafter referred to as a "target") by using
electromagnetic radiation or microwave energy to heat tissue in order to denature or kill cancerous
cells. The construction and use of a system including such an ablation probe 130 is more fully
described in co-pending patent application no. 14/828,682 entitled MICROWAVE ABLATION
SYSTEM, filed on August 26, 2014, by Dickhans, co-pending patent application publication no.
2014/0046315 entitled MICROWAVE ABLATION CATHETER AND METHOD OF UTILIZING
THE SAME, filed on March 15, 2013, by Latkow et al., and co-pending patent application
publication no. 2014/0276739 entitled MICROWAVE ENERGY-DELIVERY DEVICE AND
SYSTEM, filed on March 15, 2013, by Brannan et al., the contents of all of which is hereby
incorporated by reference in its entirety.
10047]       The location of ablation probe 130 within the body of the patient may be tracked during
the surgical procedure. An example method of tracking the location of ablation probe 130 is by
using the EM tracking system, which tracks the location of ablation probe 130 by tracking sensors
attached to or incorporated in ablation probe 130. Various types of sensors may be used, such as a
printed sensor, the construction and use of which is more fully described in co-pending provision
patent application no. 62/095,563 filed December 22, 2014, the entire contents of which is
incorporated herein by reference. Prior to starting the procedure, the clinician is able to verify the
accuracy of the tracking system.
10048]       Turning now to FIG. 2, there is shown a system diagram of computing device 100.
Computing device 100 may include memory 202, processor 204, display 206, network interface 208,
input device 210, and/or output module 212.
10049]       Memory 202 includes any non-transitory computer-readable storage media for storing
data and/or software that is executable by processor 204 and which controls the operation of
computing device 100. In an embodiment, memory 202 may include one or more solid-state storage
devices such as flash memory chips. Alternatively or in addition to the one or more solid-state

                                                     9
storage devices, memory 202 may include one or more mass storage devices connected to the
processor 204 through a mass storage controller (not shown) and a communications bus (not
shown). Although the description of computer-readable media contained herein refers to a solid
state storage, it should be appreciated by those skilled in the art that computer-readable storage
media can be any available media that can be accessed by the processor 204. That is, computer
readable storage media includes non-transitory, volatile and non-volatile, removable and non
removable media implemented in any method or technology for storage of information such as
computer-readable instructions, data structures, program modules or other data.             For example,
computer-readable storage media includes RAM, ROM, EPROM, EEPROM, flash memory or other
solid state memory technology, CD-ROM, DVD, Blu-Ray or other optical storage, magnetic
cassettes, magnetic tape, magnetic disk storage or other magnetic storage devices, or any other
medium which can be used to store the desired information and which can be accessed by
computing device 100.
10050]      Memory 202 may store application 216 and/or CT data 214. Application 216 may, when
executed by processor 204, cause display 206 to present user interface 218.
10051]      Processor 204 may be a general purpose processor, a specialized graphics processing unit
(GPU) configured to perform specific graphics processing tasks while freeing up the general
purpose processor to perform other tasks, and/or any number or combination of such processors.
10052]      Display 206 may be touch sensitive and/or voice activated, enabling display 206 to serve
as both an input and output device. Alternatively, a keyboard (not shown), mouse (not shown), or
other data input devices may be employed.
10053]      Network interface 208 may be configured to connect to a network such as a local area
network (LAN) consisting of a wired network and/or a wireless network, a wide area network
(WAN), a wireless mobile network, a Bluetooth network, and/or the internet.                 For example,
computing device 100 may receive computed tomographic (CT) image data of a patient from a
server, for example, a hospital server, internet server, or other similar servers, for use during surgical
ablation planning. Patient CT image data may also be provided to computing device 100 via a
removable memory 202. Computing device 100 may receive updates to its software, for example,
application 216, via network interface 208. Computing device 100 may also display notifications on
display 206 that a software update is available.

                                                   10
100541       Input device 210 may be any device by means of which a user may interact with
computing device 100, such as, for example, a mouse, keyboard, foot pedal, touch screen, and/or
voice interface.
10055]       Output module 212 may include any connectivity port or bus, such as, for example,
parallel ports, serial ports, universal serial busses (USB), or any other similar connectivity port
known to those skilled in the art.
10056]       Application 216 may be one or more software programs stored in memory 202 and
executed by processor 204 of computing device 100. As will be described in more detail below,
during the planning phase, application 216 guides a clinician through a series of steps to identify a
target, size the target, size a treatment zone, and/or determine an access route to the target for later
use during the procedure phase. In some embodiments, application 216 is loaded on computing
devices in an operating room or other facility where surgical procedures are performed, and is used
as a plan or map to guide a clinician performing a surgical procedure, but without any feedback
from ablation probe 130 used in the procedure to indicate where ablation probe 130 is located in
relation to the plan. In other embodiments, system 10 provides computing device 100 with data
regarding the location of ablation probe 130 within the body of the patient, such as by EM tracking,
which application 216 may then use to indicate on the plan where ablation probe 130 are located.
10057]       Application 216 may be installed directly on computing device 100, or may be installed
on another computer, for example a central server, and opened on computing device 100 via
network interface 208. Application 216 may run natively on computing device 100, as a web-based
application, or any other format known to those skilled in the art. In some embodiments, application
216 will be a single software program having all of the features and functionality described in the
present disclosure. In other embodiments, application 216 may be two or more distinct software
programs providing various parts of these features and functionality. For example, application 216
may include one software program for use during the planning phase, and a second software
program for use during the procedure phase of the microwave ablation treatment. In such instances,
the various software programs forming part of application 216 may be enabled to communicate with
each other and/or import and export various settings and parameters relating to the microwave
ablation treatment and/or the patient to share information. For example, a treatment plan and any of
its components generated by one software program during the planning phase may be stored and
exported to be used by a second software program during the procedure phase.

                                                     11
100581      Application 216 communicates with a user interface 218 which generates a user interface
for presenting visual interactive features to a clinician, for example, on display 206 and for receiving
clinician input, for example, via a user input device. For example, user interface 218 may generate a
graphical user interface (GUI) and output the GUI to display 206 for viewing by a clinician.
Examples of the GUI are described below with reference to Figs. 3A-3E and 4.
10059]      Computing device 100 is linked to display 110, thus enabling computing device 100 to
control the output on display 110 along with the output on display 206. Computing device 100 may
control display 110 to display output which is the same as or similar to the output displayed on
display 206.      For example, the output on display 206 may be mirrored on display 100.
Alternatively, computing device 100 may control display 110 to display different output from that
displayed on display 206. For example, display 110 may be controlled to display guidance images
and information during the microwave ablation procedure, while display 206 is controlled to display
other output, such as configuration or status information.
100601      As used herein, the term "clinician" refers to any medical professional (i.e., doctor,
surgeon, nurse, or the like) or other user of the treatment planning system 10 involved in planning,
performing, monitoring and/or supervising a medical procedure involving the use of the
embodiments described herein.
100611      Turning now to Fig. 3A, there is shown an example GUI 300 generated by user interface
218 which may be presented by computing device 100 on display 206 and/or display 110. GUI 300
includes graphical representation of an ablation antenna 310 corresponding to ablation probe 130, a
graphical representation of an ultrasound wand 320 corresponding to ultrasound imager 140, a
graphical representation of a trajectory 315 of ablation probe 130, an ultrasound image plane 325,
and a projected ablation zone indicator 330 showing a projected ablation zone as configured for the
current ablation procedure.     Ultrasound image plane 325 will include an ultrasound image (not
shown here for the purpose of more clearly depicting the elements being described) based on
ultrasound image data captured by ultrasound imager 140. GUI 300 further includes an US probe
indicator 302 and antenna indicator 303 that indicates whether ultrasound imager 140 and ablation
probe 130 are connected to computing device 100 and system 10. GUI 300 also includes indicators
of a time 304, temperature 306, and wattage 308 configured for the current ablation procedure.
10062]      Trajectory 315 shows the trajectory at which ablation probe 130 is being navigated inside
the patient's body. The length of trajectory 315 corresponds to the length of ablation probe 130.

                                                   12
Likewise, the width of trajectory 315 corresponds to the width of ablation probe 130. Thus, when
positioning ablation probe 130 and ultrasound imager 140 outside the patient's body, trajectory 315
will show the distance ablation probe 130 can be navigated into the patient's body. As such, the
clinician can determine whether ablation probe 130 can reach the target tissue inside the patient's
body before inserting ablation probe 130 into the patient's body.
100631      GUI 300 may depict ablation antenna 310 and trajectory 315 as outlines, such that the
ultrasound image displayed on ultrasound image plane 325 is not obscured by ablation antenna 310
and trajectory 315. GUI 300 further depicts ablation antenna 310 and trajectory 315 in relation to
ultrasound image plane 325. That is, when ablation probe 130 does not intersect ultrasound image
plane 325, ablation antenna 310 is depicted as shadowed (e.g. dimmed or greyed-out). For example,
as shown in FIG. 3A, ablation antenna 310 is depicted in a shadowed section 31 Ob for the portion of
ablation antenna 310 displayed behind ultrasound image plane 325.         Likewise, trajectory 315 is
depicted as a shadowed section 315b for the portion of trajectory 315 that is behind ultrasound
image plane 325.     In contrast, the portion of the trajectory 315a which is in front of ultrasound
image plane 325 is shown as regular (of normal brightness and not shadowed or dimmed).
10064]      While FIG. 3A shows an example where all of ablation antenna 310 and trajectory 315
are behind ultrasound image plane 325, FIG. 3B shows an example where all of ablation antenna
310 and trajectory 315 are in front of ultrasound image plane 325. That is, ablation probe 130 is
located entirely in front of, and does not intersect, the plane of the image generated by ultrasound
imager 140.
100651      FIG. 3C shows another example GUI 300 generated by user interface 218 which may be
displayed by computing device 100 on display 206 and/or display 110. FIG. 3C includes many of
the same elements as FIGS. 3A and 3B. Those elements are identified using the same reference
numerals as in FIGS. 3A and 3B, and will not be described again for purpose of brevity.
100661      FIG. 3C shows an example where ablation antenna 310 is co-planar with ultrasound
image plane 325.    The area of intersection between plane of ablation antenna 310 and ultrasound
image plane 325 is indicated by an obround 340. Because ablation antenna 310 is co-planar with
ultrasound image plane 325, obround 340 is shown as two parallel lines on either side of ablation
antenna 310 and trajectory 315.
10067]      FIG. 3D shows an example where ablation antenna 310 intersects ultrasound image plane
325. Unlike in FIG. 3C, where ablation antenna 310 is co-planar with ultrasound image plane 325

                                                  13
and obround 340 extends the length of ablation antenna 310 and trajectory 315, in FIG. 3D, obround
340 appears elliptical around the area of intersection between ablation antenna 310 and ultrasound
image plane 325. The length and position of obround 340 is determined by the angle of intersection
between ablation antenna 310 and ultrasound image plane 325. That is, obround 340 shows the
direction and acuteness of the angle of intersection between ablation antenna 310 and ultrasound
image plane 325.     The point of intersection between ablation antenna 310 and ultrasound image
plane 325 is shown by intersection indicator 345.
100681      GUI 300 may further show an ablation progress indicator 335 after computing device
110 determines that the ablation procedure has been started. Ablation progress indicator 335 shows
the progress of the ablation procedure being performed. Ablation progress indicator 335 will start
close to ablation antenna 310 and move out toward projected ablation zone indicator 330 as the
ablation procedure proceeds.
100691      FIG. 3E shows another example GUI 300 generated by user interface 218 which may be
displayed by computing device 100 on display 206 and/or display 110. FIG. 3E includes many of
the same elements as FIGs. 3A-3D.          Those elements are identified using the same reference
numerals as in FIGs. 3A-3D and will not be described again for purpose of brevity.
10070]      FIGs. 3A-3D show ultrasound image plane 325 in which the orientation of ultrasound
wand 320 and ultrasound image plane 325 are maintained in a fixed orientation normal to GUI 300.
FIG. 3E, in contrast, depicts ultrasound wand 320 and an ultrasound image plane 327 according to
an orientation of ultrasound imager 140 within an EM field generated by EM field generator 121.
Thus, when the clinician moves ultrasound imager 140, the depiction of ultrasound wand 320 and
ultrasound image plane 327 in GUI 300 changes according to the movement and angle of ultrasound
imager 140 within the EM field, thereby providing a perspective view of the ablation zone and the
position of ablation probe 130 therein.
10071]      GUI 300 may further include a perspective view area configured to correspond to a
portion of the EM field that includes the treatment zone. For example, the patient may be positioned
on table 120 such that the EM field generated by EM field generator 121 includes the treatment zone.
Computing device 100 may then automatically and/or with assistance from the clinician select a
portion of the EM field that includes the treatment zone, and may configure application 216 and/or
GUI 300 to depict ablation antenna 310, ultrasound wand 320, ultrasound image plane 327, and the
various other elements described above, in the perspective view area based on their detected and/or

                                                    14
determined positions within the EM field. For example, ultrasound image plane 327 and ultrasound
wand 320 may only be depicted in the perspective view area when ultrasound imager 140 is detected
to be positioned within the portion of the EM field that is configured to be displayed in the
perspective view area of GUI 300. Likewise, ablation antenna 310 may only be depicted in the
perspective view area when ablation probe 130 is detected to be positioned within the portion of the
EM field that is configured to be displayed in the perspective view area of GUI 300. Thus, when
ultrasound imager 140 and/or ablation probe 130 are not in the portion of the EM field that is
configured to be displayed in the perspective view area of GUI 300, GUI 300 will not display
ultrasound wand 320, ultrasound image plane 327, and/or ablation antenna 310 in the perspective
view area. The portion of the EM field that is configured to be displayed in the perspective view
area of GUI 300 may be adjusted during the ablation procedure, such as by moving and/or zooming
in and out.
10072]       As depicted in FIG. 3E, ultrasound imager 140 is rotated approximately 900 to the left
and obliquely to the plane of the portion of the EM field shown in the perspective view area of GUI
300.   These differences in orientation assist the clinician in understanding how movement of
ultrasound imager 140 affects both ultrasound image plane 327 and ultrasound image plane 325. As
depicted in FIG. 3E, projected ablation zone indicator 330 and/or progress indicator 335 may be
three-dimensional (3D) projections. This 3D projection of either projected ablation zone indicator
330 and/or progress indicator 335 provides greater understanding of how the ablation zone interacts
with all tissue and other structures in the ablation zone, and, during treatment, depicts how energy is
being absorbed in all directions. Further, these features allow the clinician to sweep across ablation
probe 130 to ascertain with greater clarity the effects of the ablation treatment on the treatment zone.
10073]       FIG. 4 shows an example GUI 400 generated by user interface 218 which may be
displayed by computing device 100 on display 206 and/or display 110. FIG. 4 includes many of the
same elements as FIGS. 3A-3E. Those elements are identified using the same reference numerals as
in FIGS. 3A-3E and will not be described again for purpose of brevity.
10074]       GUI 400 includes side-by-side depictions of ultrasound image plane 325, which is
displayed normal to GUI 300, as shown in FIGS. 3A-3D, and ultrasound image plane 327, which is
shown relative to the placement of ultrasound imager 140 within the EM field generated by EM
field generator 121.

                                                  15
100751      Turning now to FIG. 5, there is shown a flowchart of an example method for performing
a microwave ablation procedure according to an embodiment of the present disclosure. At step 502,
computing device 100 receives ablation procedure configuration settings.        The settings may be
entered manually by a clinician performing the ablation procedure, or may be preloaded from a
preconfigured configuration settings file that was previously entered by the clinician. The ablation
settings may be based on a particular treatment profile specific to the patient and/or the type of
tissue sought to be ablated. The ablation settings may include an ablation time, temperature, and
wattage. Once received, GUI 300 will display these ablation settings at indicators 304, 306, and 308,
respectively. Further details about the planning phase of microwave ablation treatment is more fully
described in co-pending provisional patent application number 14/821,950 entitled TREATMENT
PROCEDURE PLANNING SYSTEM AND METHOD.
10076]       Then, at step 504, computing device 100 receives ultrasound image data from ultrasound
imager 140. The ultrasound image data may be relayed from ultrasound workstation 150. Next, or
concurrently with step 504, computing device 100 receives EM tracking data from the EM tracking
system for ultrasound imager 140 and ablation probe 130 at step 506.
10077]      Thereafter, at step 508, computing device 100 determines a trajectory of ablation probe
130 based on the EM tracking data.        Next, at step 510, computing device 100 determines an
intersection between ablation probe 130, or the trajectory of ablation probe 130, and the plane of the
ultrasound image data received from ultrasound imager 140. Thereafter, at step 512, computing
device 100 generates a GUI showing ablation antenna 310 and trajectory 315 in relation to
ultrasound image plane 325, which is based on the ultrasound image data received from ultrasound
imager 140, as well as the projected ablation zone 330, as shown in FIGS. 3A-3E and 4, described
above. Next, at step 514, computing device 100 displays the GUI on display 206 and/or display 110.
10078]      Next, at step 516, computing device determines whether the position of ablation probe
130 has changed. If yes, computing device 100 updates the GUI at step 520. If not, computing
device 100 determines, at step 518, whether the position of ultrasound imager 140 has changed. If
yes, computing device 100 updates the GUI at step 520.           If not, computing device continues
displaying the GUI unchanged at step 514. Steps 516 and 518 may be performed interchangeably
and/or concurrently, and will be performed iteratively throughout the ablation procedure.

                                                    16
100791       After updating the GUI, computing device 100 determines, at step 522, whether the
ablation procedure is complete. If yes, processing ends. If not, computing device displays the GUI,
and processing returns to step 514.
10080]       Simultaneously with step 516, at step 524, computing device 100 determines whether the
ablation process has started. If yes, computing device 100, at step 526, updates the GUI with an
indicator of the progress of the ablation process, for example, indicator 335 shown in FIGS. 3D and
3E. Thereafter, at step 528, computing device 100 determines whether the ablation process has been
completed.     If yes, processing ends.    If not, processing returns to step 526, where the GUI is
iteratively updated based on the progress of the ablation procedure.
100811       Turning now to FIGs. 6A-6D, there are shown another example GUI 600 generated by
user interface 218 which may be presented by computing device 100 on display 206 and/or display
110. GUI 600 includes many of the same elements as described above with reference to FIGs. 3A
3E. Such elements are identified by the same reference numerals as described above, and therefore
will not be described in detail again for purpose of brevity.
10082]       With reference to FIG. 6A, GUI 600 includes graphical representation of an ablation
antenna 310 corresponding to ablation probe 130, a graphical representation of an ultrasound wand
320 corresponding to ultrasound imager 140, a graphical representation of a trajectory 315 of
ablation probe 130, an ultrasound image plane 325 including an ultrasound image 326 based on
ultrasound image data captured by ultrasound imager 140, a projected ablation zone indicator 330
showing a projected ablation zone as configured for the current ablation procedure, and an obround
340 indicating the area of intersection between the plane of ablation antenna 310 and ultrasound
image plane 325. GUI 600 further includes a perspective view area showing a perspective view of
ultrasound wand 320 and an ultrasound image plane 327 based on the position of ultrasound imager
140 within the portion of the EM field configured to be displayed in the perspective view area, as
well as the position of ablation antenna 310 relative to ultrasound image plane 327, as described
above with reference to FIG. 3E. Because ultrasound image plane 327 is displayed in a perspective
view according to the position of ultrasound imager 140, projected ablation zone indicator 330 may
be displayed according to a three-dimensional perspective of the projected ablation zone, such as by
a dome 330a and/or a sphere (as shown in FIG. 6D).
100831       FIG. 6B shows another example GUI 600 generated by user interface 218 which may be
presented by computing device 100 on display 206 and/or display 110. As shown in FIG. 6B, GUI

                                                 17
600 displays ultrasound wand 320 and ablation antenna 310 at angles different from FIG. 6A,
thereby showing how moving ultrasound imager 140 and/or ablation probe 130 within the EM field
may result in different output on GUI 600.
10084]     FIG. 6C shows yet another example GUI 600 generated by user interface 218 which may
be presented by computing device 100 on display 206 and/or display 110. As shown in FIG. 6C,
GUI 600 displays ablation zone indicator 330 according to different settings and/or at a different
time during the ablation procedure, for example, after more time has elapsed.
100851     FIG. 6D shows yet another example GUI 600 generated by user interface 218 which may
be presented by computing device 100 on display 206 and/or display 110. As shown in FIG. 6D,
GUI 600 displays ablation zone indicator 330 as a spherical shape centered on the ablation antenna
310.
100861     Although embodiments have been described in detail with reference to the accompanying
drawings for the purpose of illustration and description, it is to be understood that the inventive
processes and apparatus are not to be construed as limited thereby. It will be apparent to those of
ordinary skill in the art that various modifications to the foregoing embodiments may be made
without departing from the scope of the disclosure.
