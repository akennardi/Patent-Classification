    FIELD OF INVENTION
    [00021 The invention relates to methods of increasing flux through a fermentation pathway
    by optimising enzymatic reactions.         More particularly, the invention relates to identifying
    and addressing reaction bottlenecks in fermentation pathways.
10  BACKGROUND
    [00031 Acetogenic microorganisms are known to be useful for the production of fuels and
    other chemicals (for example, ethanol, butanol or butanediol) by fermentation of substrates
    including carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and hydrogen, for example.
    [00041 Efforts so far to improve product concentration and substrate utilization have focused
15  on strain selection, optimisation of fermentation conditions and parameters as well as
    optimisation of media formulation or process conditions (Abubackar et al., 2012). The
    metabolism of natural organisms, however, did not evolve to achieve commercial objectives
    of high yields, rates and titers (Nielsen, 2011). While the rate of certain reactions in the
    organism can be increased by optimization of process conditions or strain selection, there are
20  typically some reactions that are not affected and will be rate limiting.
    [00051 In the last decade, a number of in silicon predictive tools have been developed to
    explore genome scale metabolic reconstructions.            These constraint-based models use a
    stoichiometric approach to study the flux through metabolic networks, in which all possible
    net flux distributions (feasible flux space) are constrained by observed cellular input and
25  output measurements (external fluxes) and by mass balance and thermodynamic equations.
    Flux balance analysis (FBA) probes this solution space to identify metabolic flux
    distributions that optimize certain objectives (usually maximizing growth). Flux balance
    analysis requires very little information in terms of the enzyme kinetic parameters and
    concentration of metabolites in the system. However, one limitation of such an approach is
30  that it is unable to identify rate limiting reactions (bottlenecks).

20  DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
    Definitions
    [0039] As referred to herein, a "fermentation pathway" is a cascade of biochemical reactions
    (referred to herein as "pathway reactions") by which a substrate, preferably a gaseous
    substrate, is converted to a fermentation product. The pathway reactions typically involve
25  enzymes and may involve co-factors whereby the enzyme or co-factor facilitates or increases
    the rate of the pathway reaction.
    [00401 As referred to herein, a "rate-limiting pathway reaction" is a reaction which is part of
    a fermentation pathway, and is a "bottleneck" in the pathway whereby flux through the entire
    pathway is slowed and determined by the rate of reaction of the rate-limiting pathway

    limiting pathway reaction has a knock-on effect on the rate of the overall fermentation
    pathway and potentially the production of the one or more fermentation products. Where "a"
    or "the" (singular) rate-limiting pathway reaction is referred to herein, it should be
 5  understood that multiple (for example 2 or more) rate-limiting pathway reactions are also
    included within the scope of the invention and such multiple reactions may also be
    determined and altered according to the methods described herein.
    [00411 As referred to herein, reaction "flux" refers to the flow of metabolites through one or
    more reactions in a fermentation pathway. The flux through individual pathway reactions has
10  an upper and lower limit therefore the flux may be changed by the adjustment of conditions
    or factors that affect enzymatic activity.     Adjustment of the flux through one pathway
    reaction may alter the overall flux of the fermentation pathway.       Flux may be measured
    according to methods known to one of skill in the art. By way of example, flux may be
    measured using flux-balance analysis (FBA) (Gianchandani et al., 2010).         In a particular
15  embodiment, the flux is increased by at least 5%, at least 10%, at least 20%, at least 30%, at
    least 50%, at least 100%. Flux through the pathway may also be measured by the level of
    metabolites and products (metabolomics) (Patti et al., 2012) and/or labelling experiments as
    C13 (fluxomics) (Niittylae et al., 2009; Tang et al., 2009).
    [0042] The term "nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide" (NADH) refers to either NAD+
20  (oxidized form), NADH + H+ (reduced form) or the the redox couple of both NAD+ and
    NADH + H+.
    [0043] The term "nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate" (NADPH) refers to either
    NADP+ (oxidized form), NADPH + H+ (reduced form) or the redox couple of both NADP+
    and NADPH + H+.
25  [0044] As referred to herein, an "enzyme co-factor", or simply a "co-factor" is a non-protein
    compound that binds to an enzyme to facilitate the biological function of the enzyme and thus
    the catalysis of a reaction.  Non-limiting examples of co-factors include NAD+, NADP+,
    cobalamine, tetrahydrofolate and ferredoxin. Increase in the overall availability of the co
    factor can increase the rate of a pathway reaction. Factors that may affect production of the
30  co-factor include the expression of co-factor biosynthesis genes which may be altered to
    achieve increased availability of the co-factor. Other factors known to one of skill in the art
    may also be used to achieve increased availability of the co-factor. Lack of availability of co

    factors can have rate-limiting effects on pathway reactions. Methods for the determination of
    availability of co-factors will be known to those of skill in the art.
    [00451 The term "adapted to" may be used herein to describe the function of a recombinant
    microorganism of the invention; for example, the microorganism is "adapted to" express a
 5  particular enzyme.      When used in relation to the expression of an enzyme, the term does not
    imply that the enzyme is continuously expressed, it is intended to cover situations where the
    enzyme may be expressed and such expression may be constitutive or induced.
    [0046] As referred to herein, a "fermentation broth" is a culture medium comprising at least
    nutrients and microorganism cells.
10  [0047] The terms "increasing the efficiency", "increased efficiency" and the like, when used
    in relation to a fermentation pathway or process, include, but are not limited to at least one of:
    an increased rate of growth of microorganisms effecting the fermentation; an increased rate
    of growth or product production rate at elevated product concentrations; an increased
    fermentation product concentration in the fermentation broth; an increased volume of
15  fermentation product produced per volume of substrate consumed; an increased rate of
    production or level of production of the fermentation product. The increases in efficiency are
    measured relative to the corresponding variable as measured when using a parental
    microorganism.
    [00481 "Enzyme activity", "activity of one or more enzymes" and like phrases should be
20  taken broadly to refer to enzymatic activity, including but not limited to the activity of an
    individual enzyme, the amount of enzyme, or the availability of an enzyme. Accordingly,
    where reference is made to "increasing" enzyme activity, it should be taken to include an
    increase in the activity of an individual enzyme, an increase in the amount of the enzyme, or
    an increase in the availability of an enzyme to catalyse a particular reaction.
25  [0049] The phrase "Involved in catalysing" is intended to encompass enzymes which directly
    catalyse (i.e. facilitate or increase the rate of) a reaction, as well as co.-factors which do not
    directly catalyse a reaction but facilitate the biological function of an associated enzyme.
    [0050] The phrase "substrate comprising carbon monoxide" and like terms should be
    understood to include any substrate in which carbon monoxide is available to one or more
30  strains of bacteria for growth and/or fermentation, for example.
    [0051] The phrase "gaseous substrate comprising carbon monoxide" and like phrases and
    terms includes any gas which contains a level of carbon monoxide. In certain embodiments
                                                     10

   WO 20141197746                                                             PCTIUS2014/041188
    the substrate contains at least about 20% to about 100% CO by volume, from 20% to 70%
    CO by volume, from 30% to 60% CO by volume, and from 40% to 55% CO by volume. In
    particular embodiments, the substrate comprises about 25%, or about 30%, or about 35%, or
    about 40%, or about 45%, or about 50% CO, or about 55% CO, or about 60% CO by volume.
 5  [0052] While it is not necessary for the substrate to contain any hydrogen, the presence of H2
    should not be detrimental to product formation in accordance with methods of the invention.
    In particular embodiments, the presence of hydrogen results in an improved overall efficiency
    of alcohol production. For example, in particular embodiments, the substrate may comprise
    an approx. 2:1, or 1:1, or 1:2 ratio of H2 :CO. In one embodiment the substrate comprises
10  about 30% or less H2 by volume, 20% or less H2 by volume, about 15% or less H2 by volume
    or about 10% or less H, by volume. In other embodiments, the substrate stream comprises
    low concentrations of H 2, for example, less than 5%, or less than 4%, or less than 3%, or less
    than 2%, or less than 1%, or is substantially hydrogen free. The substrate may also contain
    some CO 2 for example, such as about 1% to about 80% CO 2 by volume, or 1% to about 30%
15  CO 2 by volume. In one embodiment the substrate comprises less than or equal to about 20%
    CO 2 by volume.     In particular embodiments the substrate comprises less than or equal to
    about 15% CO 2 by volume, less than or equal to about 10% CO 2 by volume, less than or equal
    to about 5% CO 2 by volume or substantially no CO 2.
    [00531 In the description which follows, embodiments of the invention are described in terms
20  of delivering and fermenting a "gaseous substrate containing CO". However, it should be
    appreciated that the gaseous substrate may be provided in alternative forms. For example, the
    gaseous substrate containing CO may be provided dissolved in a liquid. Essentially, a liquid
    is saturated with a carbon monoxide containing gas and then that liquid is added to the
    bioreactor.   This may be achieved using standard methodology.          By way of example, a
25  microbubble dispersion generator (Hensirisak et. al. Scale-up of microbubble dispersion
    generator for aerobic fermentation; Applied Biochemistry and Biotechnology Volume 101,
    Number 3 / October, 2002) could be used. By way of further example, the gaseous substrate
    containing CO may be adsorbed onto a solid support.             Such alternative methods are
    encompassed by use of the term "substrate containing CO" and the like.
30  [00541 In particular embodiments of the invention, the CO-containing gaseous substrate is an
    industrial off or waste gas. "Industrial waste or off gases" should be taken broadly to include
    any gases comprising CO produced by an industrial process and include gases produced as a

    result of ferrous metal products manufacturing, non-ferrous products manufacturing,
    petroleum refining processes, gasification of coal, gasification of biomass, electric power
    production, carbon black production, and coke manufacturing.       Further examples may be
    provided elsewhere herein.
 5  [00551 Unless the context requires otherwise, the phrases "fermenting", "fermentation
    process" or "fermentation reaction" and the like, as used herein, are intended to encompass
    both the growth phase and product biosynthesis phase of the process. As will be described
    further herein, in some embodiments the bioreactor may comprise a first growth reactor and a
    second fermentation reactor.      As such, the addition of metals or compositions to a
10  fermentation reaction should be understood to include addition to either or both of these
    reactors.
    [0056] The term "bioreactor" includes a fermentation device consisting of one or more
    vessels and/or towers or piping arrangement, which includes the Continuous Stirred Tank
    Reactor (CSTR), Immobilized Cell Reactor (ICR), Trickle Bed Reactor (TBR), Bubble
15  Column, Gas Lift Fermenter, Static Mixer, or other vessel or other device suitable for gas
    liquid contact. In some embodiments the bioreactor may comprise a first growth reactor and
    a second fermentation reactor. As such, when referring to the addition of substrate to the
    bioreactor or fermentation reaction it should be understood to include addition to either or
    both of these reactors where appropriate.
20  [0057] As referred to herein, a "shuttle microorganism" is a microorganism in which a
    methyltransferase enzyme is expressed and is distinct from the destination microorganism.
    [00581 As referred to herein, a "destination microorganism" is a microorganism in which the
    genes included on an expression construct/vector are expressed and is distinct from the
    shuttle microorganism.
25  [0059] "Exogenous nucleic acids" are nucleic acids which originate outside of the
    microorganism to which they are introduced. Exogenous nucleic acids may be derived from
    any appropriate source, including, but not limited to, the microorganism to which they are to
    be introduced (for example in a parental microorganism from which the recombinant
    microorganism is derived), strains or species of microorganisms which differ from the
30  organism to which they are to be introduced, or they may be artificially or recombinantly
    created.   In one embodiment, the exogenous nucleic acids represent nucleic acid sequences
    naturally present within the microorganism to which they are to be introduced, and they are
                                                  12

   WO 20141197746                                                              PCTIUS2014/041188
    introduced to increase expression of or over-express a particular gene (for example, by
    increasing the copy number of the sequence (for example a gene), or introducing a strong or
    constitutive promoter to increase expression). In another embodiment, the exogenous nucleic
    acids represent nucleic acid sequences not naturally present within the microorganism to
 5  which they are to be introduced and allow for the expression of a product not naturally
    present within the microorganism or increased expression of a gene native to the
    microorganism (for example in the case of introduction of a regulatory element such as a
    promoter). The exogenous nucleic acid may be adapted to integrate into the genome of the
    microorganism to which it is to be introduced or to remain in an extra-chromosomal state.
10  [00601 "Exogenous" may also be used to refer to proteins. This refers to a protein that is not
    present in the parental microorganism from which the recombinant microorganism is derived.
    [0061] The term "endogenous" as used herein in relation to a recombinant microorganism
    and a nucleic acid or protein refers to any nucleic acid or protein that is present in a parental
    microorganism from which the recombinant microorganism is derived.
15  [0062] Oxidoreductases (or dehydrogenases, oxidases) include enzymes that catalyse the
    transfer of electrons from one molecule - the reductant, also called the electron donor, to
    another molecule - the oxidant, also called the electron acceptor. Oxidoreductases are
    classified as EC I in the EC number classification of enzymes.
    [00631 It should be appreciated that the invention may be practised using nucleic acids whose
20  sequence varies from the sequences specifically exemplified herein provided they perform
    substantially the same function. For nucleic acid sequences that encode a protein or peptide
    this means that the encoded protein or peptide has substantially the same function. For
    nucleic acid sequences that represent promoter sequences, the variant sequence will have the
    ability to promote expression of one or more genes. Such nucleic acids may be referred to
25  herein as "functionally equivalent variants".     By way of example, functionally equivalent
    variants of a nucleic acid include allelic variants, fragments of a gene, genes which include
    mutations (deletion, insertion, nucleotide substitutions and the like) and/or polymorphisms
    and the like.   Homologous genes from other microorganisms may also be considered as
    examples of functionally equivalent variants of the sequences specifically exemplified herein.
30  These include homologous genes in species such as Clostridium acetobutylicum, Clostridium
    bejerinckii, C Ijungdahlii details of which are publicly available on websites such as
    Genbank or NCBl. The phrase "functionally equivalent variants" should also be taken to
                                                   13

    include nucleic acids whose sequence varies as a result of codon optimisation for a particular
    organism. "Functionally equivalent variants" of a nucleic acid herein will preferably have at
    least approximately 70%, preferably approximately 80%, more preferably approximately
    85%, preferably approximately 90%, preferably approximately 95% or greater nucleic acid
 5  sequence identity with the nucleic acid identified.
    [0064] It should also be appreciated that the invention may be practised using polypeptides
    whose sequence varies from the amino acid sequence of the polypeptide specifically referred
    to or exemplified herein. These variants may be referred to herein as "functionally equivalent
    variants". A functionally equivalent variant of a protein or a peptide includes those proteins
10  or peptides that share at least 40%, preferably 50%, preferably 60%, preferably 70%,
    preferably 75%, preferably 80%, preferably 85%, preferably 90%, preferably 95% or greater
    amino acid identity with the protein or peptide identified and has substantially the same
    function as the peptide or protein of interest.      Such variants include within their scope
    fragments of a protein or peptide wherein the fragment comprises a truncated form of the
15  polypeptide wherein deletions may be from I to 5, to 10, to 15, to 20, to 25 amino acids, and
    may extend from residue 1 through 25 at either terminus of the polypeptide, and wherein
    deletions may be of any length within the region; or may be at an internal location.
    Functionally equivalent variants of the specific polypeptides herein should also be taken to
    include polypeptides expressed by homologous genes in other species of bacteria, for
20  example as exemplified in the previous paragraph.
    [00651 "Substantially the same function" as used herein is intended to mean that the nucleic
    acid or polypeptide is able to perform the function of the nucleic acid or polypeptide of which
    it is a variant. For example, a variant of an enzyme of the invention will be able to catalyse
    the same reaction as that enzyme. However, it should not be taken to mean that the variant
25  has the same level of activity as the polypeptide or nucleic acid of which it is a variant.
    [0066] One may assess whether a functionally equivalent variant has substantially the same
    function as the nucleic acid or polypeptide of which it is a variant using methods known to
    one of skill in the art. However, by way of example, assays to test for hydrogenase, formate
    dehydrogenase or methylene-THF-dehydrogenase activity are described in Huang et al
30  (2012).
    [0067] "Over-express", "over expression" and like terms and phrases when used in relation
    to the invention should be taken broadly to include any increase in expression of one or more
                                                   14

    proteins (including expression of one or more nucleic acids encoding same) as compared to
    the expression level of the protein (including nucleic acids) of a parental microorganism
    under the same conditions. It should not be taken to mean that the protein (or nucleic acid) is
    expressed at any particular level.
 5  [00681 A "recombinant microorganism" is a microorganism that has undergone intentional
    genetic modification when compared to a parental microorganism. A "genetic modification"
    should be taken broadly and includes insertion, deletion or substitution of nucleic acids, for
    example.
    [00691 A "parental microorganism" is a microorganism used to generate a recombinant
10  microorganism of the invention.       The parental microorganism may be one that occurs in
    nature (i.e. a wild type microorganism) or one that has been previously modified (i.e. it is a
    recombinant microorganism). The recombinant microorganisms of the invention may be
    modified to express or over-express one or more enzymes that were not expressed or over
    expressed to a desired level in the parental microorganism, or may be modified to exhibit
15  increased availability of one or more co-factors.
    [00701 The terms nucleic acid "constructs" or "vectors" and like terms should be taken
    broadly to include any nucleic acid (including DNA and RNA) suitable for use as a vehicle to
    transfer genetic material into a cell. The terms should be taken to include plasmids, viruses
    (including bacteriophage), cosmids and artificial chromosomes. Constructs or vectors may
20  include one or more regulatory elements, an origin of replication, a multicloning site and/or a
    selectable marker. In one particular embodiment, the constructs or vectors are adapted to
    allow expression of one or more genes encoded by the construct or vector. Nucleic acid
    constructs or vectors include naked nucleic acids as well as nucleic acids formulated with
    one or more agents to facilitate delivery to a cell (for example, liposome-conjugated nucleic
25  acid, an organism in which the nucleic acid is contained).      The vectors may be used for
    cloning or expression of nucleic acids and for transformation of microorganisms to produce
    recombinant microorganisms.
    [0071] The efficiency of a fermentation pathway can be increased by increasing the reaction
    flux through the pathway. The increased flux results in one or more of: an increased rate of
30  growth of microorganisms effecting the fermentation; an increased rate of growth and/or
    product production rate at elevated product concentrations; an increased fermentation product
    concentration in the fermentation broth; an increased volume of fermentation product
                                                   15

   WO 20141197746                                                              PCTIUS2014/041188
    produced per volume of substrate consumed; an increased rate of production or level of
    production of the fermentation product.      Preferably, the increased efficiency results in an
    increased fermentation product production rate.
    [0072] The inventors have demonstrated methods to identify rate limiting pathway reactions
 5  in the fermentation pathway where particular pathway reactions affect the flux through the
    entire pathway.      In some circumstances, these rate-limiting pathway reactions are not
    performing to their capacity and it may be desirable to increase their individual rate. The
    invention as described herein enables rate limiting pathway reactions (i.e. bottlenecks) in the
    fermentation pathway to be identified and strategies employed to increase the activity of
10  enzymes and/or the availability of co-factors which are involved in the rate limiting pathway
    reactions. This invention therefore contributes to identifying the bottleneck and adjusting the
    rate of the rate-limiting pathway reaction to have a concomitant effect on reaction flux
    through the pathway. This is the fist time that rate limiting pathway reactions have been
    identified and addressed using recombinant carboxydotrophic microorganisms.
15  [00731 One method to identify rate limiting reactions (bottlenecks) is to measure enzyme
    activities for all reactions involved in the fermentation pathway from substrate to product.
    This can be done by analysing the enzymatic activity of reactions in cells growing under
    process conditions to identify the reactions with the lowest rates. These can then be adjusted
    so as not to be rate limiting thus increasing the flux throughout the system. This kind of
20  pathway analysis and bottleneck removal has never been carried out in Clostridia species.
    [0074] The methods and recombinant microorganisms described herein enable further
    biochemical pathways to be explored and desirable fermentation products to be produced.
    The methods have particular utility for pathways where the product yield in the parental
    microorganism may have lacked the product yield to be a viable target or the yield was so
25  low as to be undetectable.
    [00751 The invention provides a method of producing a fermentation product, the method
    comprising at least the steps of:
         a) determining a rate-limiting pathway reaction in a fermentation pathway;
         b) identifying one or more enzymes, co-factors or both, which are involved in catalysing
30       the rate-limiting pathway reaction;

          c) fermenting     a CO-comprising substrate with a recombinant carboxydotrophic
          Clostridia microorganism adapted to exhibit at least one of: i) increased activity of the
          one or more enzymes of b) or a functionally equivalent variant of any one or more
          thereof, or ii) increased availability of the one or more co-factors of b), when compared
 5        to a parental microorganism, to produce a fermentation product.
    [00761 The invention also provides a method of increasing the flux through a fermentation
    pathway, the method comprising at least the steps of:
           a) determining a rate-limiting pathway reaction in the fermentation pathway;
           b) identifying one or more enzymes, co-factors or both, involved in catalysing the rate
10             limiting pathway reaction;
           c) fermenting a CO-comprising substrate with a recombinant carboxydotrophic
               Clostridia microorganism adapted to exhibit at least one of i) increased activity of
               the one or more enzymes of b) or a functionally equivalent variant of any one or
               more thereof, or ii) increased availability of the one or more co-factors of b), when
15             compared to a parental microorganism.
    [0077] The inventors have analysed the activity of enzymes involved in fermentation
    pathways and found that some pathway reactions exhibit substantially lower enzymatic
    activity than other reactions in the same pathway. This indicates that the pathway reaction is
    limiting the overall flux through the fermentation pathway and provides a method to identify
20  a rate-limiting pathway reaction.
    [0078] Enzymatic activity may be measured by methods known to one of skill in the art. In a
    particular embodiment, the enzymatic activity is measured by the method described in Huang
    et al (2012) and is referred to in Example 1.
    [0079] Examples of fermentation pathways that are amenable to analysis of enzyme activity
25  include the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway, fermentation pathways to produce ethanol, 2,3
    butanediol or a precursor thereof such as acetyl-CoA and pyruvate, and biosynthesis
    pathways for cofactors tetrahydrofolate and Cobalamine (B12) which may be required in
    fermentation pathways.
    [0080] The Wood-Ljungdahl pathway is composed of a number of reactions catalysed by

    pathway which lead to the production of desirable fermentation products are also considered
    to be part of the fermentation pathway.
    [0081] In a particular embodiment, the fermentation pathway results in the production of a
    fermentation product selected from the group consisting of ethanol, butanol, acetone,
 5  isopropanol, isobutanol, 2,3-butanediol, succinate, isoprenoids, fatty acids, and biopolymers.
    [00821 In one embodiment, in order to determine whether one or more of the pathway
    reactions is limiting the rate of flux through the fermentation pathway, the enzymatic activity
    of enzymes that catalyse at least two or more individual pathway reactions is compared. If,
    on comparison, it is found that one or more enzymes exhibit less activity than other enzymes
10  in the same reaction pathway, this indicates that the reaction is not performing to capacity. In
    a particular embodiment, the activity of the enzyme is 5%, 10% or 20% less than the activity
    of other enzymes in the pathway. In a particular embodiment, the activity is 69 % less. In
    another embodiment the activity is 86 % less. In another embodiment the activity is 90% less,
    or the difference in activity is greater than 90%.
15  [0083] As such, in a particular embodiment, the rate-limiting pathway reaction is determined
    by analysis of the enzymatic activity of two or more pathway reactions that make up the
    fermentation pathway then designating the enzyme with the lower/lowest activity as the rate
    limiting pathway reaction.
    [00841 The lack of enzymatic activity may be caused by a number of factors including: lack
20  of free enzyme to catalyse the reaction; inhibition or inactivation of the enzyme by a
    competing substrate; lack of co-factor to facilitate the reaction or lack of enzyme substrate.
    [0085] The invention also provides methods of addressing the issue of rate limiting pathway
    reactions. The deficit of enzymatic activity in the rate-limiting pathway reaction may be
    addressed by providing a recombinant Clostridia microorganism adapted to exhibit at least
25  one of i) an increase in activity of the enzyme or a functionally equivalent variant thereof or
    ii) availability of the co-factor involved in the rate-limiting pathway reaction. This results in
    an overall increase in the flux through the pathway.
    [00861 Accordingly,      the invention provides      a method of producing a recombinant
    carboxydotrophic Clostridia microorganism adapted to exhibit increased flux through a
30  fermentation pathway relative to a parental microorganism, the method comprising:
          a) determining a rate limiting pathway reaction in the fermentation pathway;

         b) identifying one or more enzymes, co-factors or both, which are involved in catalysing
         the rate-limiting pathway reaction;
         c) transforming a parental microorganism to yield a recombinant microorganism adapted
         to exhibit at least one of i) increased activity of the one or more enzymes of b) or a
 5       functionally equivalent variant of any one or more thereof, or ii) increased availability of
         the one or more co-factors of b), when compared to a parental microorganism;
    wherein the fermentation pathway is capable of producing one or more fermentation products
    from a substrate comprising CO.
    [0087] In a particular embodiment of the invention, the recombinant microorganism is
10  adapted to do at least one of:
          i) over-express the one or more enzymes involved in catalysing the rate-limiting
         pathway reaction or a functionally equivalent variant of any one or more thereof;
          ii) express one or more exogenous enzymes involved in catalysing the rate-limiting
         pathway reaction or a functionally equivalent variant of any one or more thereof; or
15        iii) have an increased availability of the one or more co-factors involved in catalysing the
         rate-limiting pathway reaction.
    [0088] In this way, the inventors have demonstrated a method to overcome at least one of i) a
    low or a lack of enzymatic activity or ii) a low or lack of availability of a co-factor in a way
    that increases the flux through a fermentation pathway and ultimately increases the efficiency
20  of the fermentation.
    [00891 In a particular embodiment of the invention, the one or more enzymes is selected from
    the group consisting of alcohol dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.l.1), aldehyde dehydrogenase

    [0091] In a particular embodiment of the invention, the recombinant microorganism is
    adapted to express an exogenous nucleic acid, or over-express an endogenous nucleic acid,
    wherein said nucleic acid encodes an enzyme or a functionally equivalent variant thereof, or
15  is involved in the biosynthesis of a co-factor, wherein said enzyme or co-factor is involved in
    catalysing the rate limiting pathway reaction.
    [0092] Methods to produce recombinant microorganisms of use in the invention are
    described hereinafter.
    [0093] The nucleic acids encoding enzymes described above would be known to one of skill
20  in the art and could be easily identified using gene information databases such as NCBI,
    KEGG, UniProt.
    [00941 The inventors have also surprisingly found that increasing the co-factor availability
    has an effect on the overall flux through the fermentation pathway.           In these cases, a
    fermentation pathway or reaction within this fermentation pathway is dependent on and may
25  be limited by the availability of a certain co-factor. The pool of a co-factor available for use
    in a reaction can be increased by altering the expression of proteins and genes involved in the
    biosynthesis pathway of this co-factor. As a result of increased co-factor availability, the
    reaction dependent on this co-factor is not limited anymore.
    [0095] In a particular embodiment, the co-factor comprises tetrahydrofolate.            As noted
30  above, enzymes involved in the biosyntbesis of such co-factor may be overexpressed,
    preferably by expressing or over-expressing the corresponding gene encoding the enzyme.

    [0097] The biosynthesis genes encoding the above-mentioned proteins would be known to
    one of skill in the art or could be easily identified using gene information databases.
 5  [0098] Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that an increase in the
    availability of a co-factor is achieved through over-expression of enzymes or genes involved
    in the biosynthesis pathway of said co-factor. As a result, reactions dependent on this co
    factor are no longer limiting.
    Modification of enymes to achieve higher activity
10  [0099] In a particular embodiment of the invention, the recombinant microorganism has
    undergone enzyme engineering to increase enzymatic activity of an enzyme capable of
    catalysing a rate-limiting pathway reaction. Enzyme engineering may include any genetic
    modification known to those of skill in the art including but not limited to deletion, insertion
    and substitution of one or more nucleotides.            Suitable methods to achieve increased
15  enzymatic activity will be known to one of skill in the art but by way of example, the method
    of enzyme engineering may be selected from the group consisting of directed evolution,
    knowledge based design, random mutagenesis methods, gene shuffling, codon optimization,
    use of site-specific libraries and use of site evaluation libraries.

    a parental microorganism.
    [01011 In particular embodiments, the increase in expression of the enzyme and/or the

    [01051 These strains form a subcluster within the Clostridial rRNA cluster I (Collins et al.,
    1994), having at least 99% identity on 16S rRNA gene level, although being distinct species
    as determined by DNA-DNA           reassociation and DNA fingerprinting experiments (WO

    and fermentative metabolism. The strains of this cluster lack cytochromes and conserve
    energy via an Rnf complex.

    of Wood-Ljungdahl pathway genes, responsible for gas uptake, has been found to be the
    same in all species, despite differences in nucleic and amino acid sequences (Kpke et al.,
    2011).
 5  [01081 The strains all have a similar morphology and size (logarithmic growing cells are
    between 0.5-0.7 x 3-5 im), are mesophilic (optimal growth temperature between 30-37 *C)
    and strictly anaerobe (Tanner et al., 1993; Abrini et al., 1994)(WO 2008/028055). Moreover,
    they all share the same major phylogenetic traits, such as same pH range (pH 4-7.5, with an
    optimal initial pH of 5.5-6), strong autotrophic growth on CO containing gases with similar
10  growth rates, and a metabolic profile with ethanol and acetic acid as main fermentation end
    product, with small amounts of 2,3-butanediol and lactic acid formed under certain conditions
    (Tanner et al., 1993; Abrini et al., 1994; K6pke et al., 201 1)(WO differentiate in substrate
    utilization of various sugars (e.g. rhamnose, arabinose), acids (e.g. gluconate, citrate), amino
    acids (e.g. arginine, histidine), or other substrates (e.g. betaine, butanol). Some of the species
15  were found to be auxotroph to certain vitamins (e.g. thiamine, biotin) while others were not.
    Reduction of carboxylic acids into their corresponding alcohols has been shown in a range of
    these organisms (Perez et al., 2012).
    [0109] The traits     described    are   therefore   not specific    to one organism      like C.
    autoethanogenum or C. jungdahlii, but rather general traits for carboxydotrophic, ethanol

    although there may be differences in performance.

    [0120] In certain embodiments, due to the restriction systems which are active in the
 5  microorganism to be transformed, it is necessary to methylate the nucleic acid to be
    introduced into the microorganism. This can be done using a variety of techniques, including
    those described below.
    [0121] By way of example, in one embodiment, a recombinant microorganism of the
    invention is produced by a method comprising the following steps:
10           introduction into a shuttle microorganism of (i) of an expression construct/vector
             comprising a nucleic acid as described herein and (ii) a methylation construct/vector
             comprising a methyltransferase gene;
             expression of the methyltransferase gene; isolation of one or more constructs/vectors
             from the shuttle microorganism; and, introduction of the one or more construct/vector
15           into a destination microorganism.
    [01221 In one embodiment, the methyltransferase gene of step B is expressed constitutively.
    In another embodiment, expression of the methyltransferase gene of step B is induced.
    [0123] The shuttle microorganism is a microorganism, preferably a restriction negative
    microorganism, that facilitates the methylation of the nucleic acid sequences that make up the
20  expression construct/vector.     In a particular embodiment, the shuttle microorganism is a
    restriction negative E. coli, Bacillus subtillis, or Lactococcus tactis.
    [0124] The methylation construct/vector comprises a nucleic acid sequence encoding a
    methyltransferase.
    [0125] Once the expression construct/vector and the methylation construct/vector are
25  introduced into the shuttle microorganism, the methyltransferase gene present on the
    methylation construct/vector is induced. Induction may be by any suitable promoter system
    although in one particular embodiment of the invention, the methylation construct/vector
    comprises an inducible lac promoter and is induced by addition of lactose or an analogue
    thereof, more preferably isopropyl-$-D-thio-galactoside (IPTG). Other suitable promoters
30  include the ara, tet, or T7 system. In a further embodiment of the invention, the methylation
    construct/vector promoter is a constitutive promoter.
                                                      27

   WO 20141197746                                                              PCTIUS2014/041188
    [01261 In a particular embodiment, the methylation construct/vector has an origin of
    replication specific to the identity of the shuttle microorganism so that any genes present on
    the methylation construct/vector are expressed in the shuttle microorganism. Preferably, the
    expression construct/vector has an origin of replication specific to the identity of the
 5  destination microorganism so that any genes present on the expression constmet/vector are
    expressed in the destination microorganism.
    [0127] Expression of the methyltransferase enzyme results in methylation of the genes
    present on the expression construct/vector.       The expression construct/vector may then be
    isolated from the shuttle microorganism according to any one of a number of known
10  methods.    By way of example only, the methodology described in the Examples section
    described hereinafter may be used to isolate the expression construct/vector.
    [0128] In one particular embodiment, both construct/vector are concurrently isolated.
    [01291 The    expression     construct/vector    may   be   introduced   into   the   destination
    microorganism using any number of known methods.             However, by way of example, the
15  methodology described in the Examples section hereinafter may be used.                 Since the
    expression construct/vector is methylated, the nucleic acid sequences present on the
    expression construct/vector are able to be incorporated into the destination microorganism
    and successfully expressed.
    [0130] It is envisaged that a methyltransferase gene may be introduced into a shuttle
20  microorganism      and    over-expressed.      Thus,   in   one    embodiment,    the   resulting
    methyltransferase enzyme may be collected using known methods and used in vitro to
    methylate an expression plasmid. The expression construct/vector may then be introduced
    into the destination      microorganism     for expression.      In another embodiment,        the
    methyltransferase gene is introduced into the genome of the shuffle microorganism followed
25  by introduction of the expression construct/vector into the shuttle microorganism, isolation of
    one or more constructs/vectors from the shuttle microorganism and then introduction of the
    expression construct/vector into the destination microorganism.
    [01311 It   is envisaged     that the     expression  construct/vector  and    the methylation
    construct/vector as defined above may be combined to provide a composition of matter.
30  Such a composition has particular utility in circumventing restriction barrier mechanisms to
    produce the recombinant microorganisms of the invention.

    [0132] In one particular embodiment, the expression construct/vector and/or the methylation
    construct/vector are plasmids.
    [01331 Persons of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate           a number of suitable
    methyltransferases of use in producing the microorganisms of the invention. However, by
 5  way of example the Bacillus subtilis phage <DT 1 methyltransferase and the methyltransferase
    described in the Examples herein after may be used.                In one embodiment, the
    methyltransferase has been described in WO/2012/053905.
    [0134] Any number of constructs/vectors adapted to allow expression of a methyltransferase
    gene may be used to generate the methylation construct/vector.         However, by way of
10  example, the plasmid described in the Examples section hereinafter may be used.
    Methods ofproduction
    [0135] As mentioned herein before, the invention also provides methods for the production
    of one or more products by fermentation of a substrate comprising CO.
    [0136] In a particular embodiment, the substrate comprising CO is a gaseous substrate
15  comprising CO. In a particular embodiment of any of the previous aspects, the substrate will
    typically contain a major proportion of CO, such as at least about 20% to about 100% CO by
    volume, from 20% to 70% CO by volume, from 30% to 60% CO by volume, and from 40%
    to 55% CO by volume. In particular embodiments, the substrate comprises about 25%, or
    about 30%, or about 35%, or about 40%, or about 45%, or about 50% CO, or about 55% CO,
20  or about 60% CO by volume.
    [0137] The gaseous substrate may be a CO-containing waste gas obtained as a by-product of
    an industrial process, or from some other source such as from automobile exhaust fumes. In
    certain embodiments, the industrial process is selected from the group consisting of ferrous
    metal products manufacturing, such as a steel mill, non-ferrous products manufacturing,
25  petroleum refining processes, gasification of coal, electric power production, carbon black
    production, ammonia production, methanol production and coke manufacturing.         In these
    embodiments, the CO-containing gas may be captured from the industrial process before it is
    emitted into the atmosphere, using any convenient method. The CO may be a component of
    syngas (gas comprising carbon monoxide and hydrogen). The CO produced from industrial
30  processes is normally flared off to produce CO 2 and therefore the invention has particular
    utility in reducing CO 2 greenhouse gas emissions and producing a biofiel. Depending on the
                                                  29

   WO 20141197746                                                              PCTIUS2014/041188
    composition of the gaseous CO -containing substrate, it may also be desirable to treat it to
    remove any undesired impurities, such as dust particles before introducing it to the
    fermentation.    For example, the gaseous substrate may be filtered or scrubbed using known
    methods.
 5  [0138] It will be appreciated that for growth of the bacteria and the production of products to
    occur, in addition to the CO-containing substrate gas, a suitable liquid nutrient medium will
    need to be fed to the bioreactor.
    [0139] In particular embodiments of the method aspects, the fermentation occurs in an
    aqueous culture medium. In particular embodiments of the method aspects, the fermentation
10  of the substrate takes place in a bioreactor.
    [0140] The substrate and media may be fed to the bioreactor in a continuous, batch or batch
    fed fashion.    A nutrient medium will contain vitamins and minerals sufficient to permit
    growth of the micro-organism used. Anaerobic media suitable for fermentation using CO are
    known in the art.      For example, suitable media are described Biebel (2001).           In one
15  embodiment of the invention the media is as described in the Examples section herein after.
    [01411 The fermentation should desirably be carried out under appropriate fermentation
    conditions for the production of the fermentation product to occur. Reaction conditions that
    should be considered include pressure, temperature, gas flow rate, liquid flow rate, media pH,
    media redox potential, agitation rate (if using a continuous stirred tank reactor), inoculum
20  level, maximum gas substrate concentrations to ensure that CO in the liquid phase does not
    become limiting, and maximum product concentrations to avoid product inhibition.
    [0142] In addition, it is often desirable to increase the CO concentration of a substrate stream
    (or CO partial pressure in a gaseous substrate) and thus increase the efficiency of
    fermentation reactions where CO is a substrate. Operating at increased pressures allows a
25  significant increase in the rate of CO transfer from the gas phase to the liquid phase where it
    can be taken up by the micro-organism as a carbon source for the production of fermentation.
    This in turn means that the retention time (defined as the liquid volume in the bioreactor
    divided by the input gas flow rate) can be reduced when bioreactors are maintained at
    elevated pressure rather than atmospheric pressure. The optimum reaction conditions will
30  depend partly on the particular micro-organism of the invention used. However, in general, it
    is preferred that the fermentation be performed at pressure higher than ambient pressure.
    Also, since a given CO conversion rate is in part a function of the substrate retention time,
                                                     30

   WO 20141197746                                                               PCTIUS2014/041188
    and achieving a desired retention time in turn dictates the required volume of a biorcactor, the
    use of pressurized systems can greatly reduce the volume of the bioreactor required, and
    consequently the capital cost of the fermentation equipment. According to examples given in
    US patent no. 5,593,886, reactor volume can be reduced in linear proportion to increases in
 5  reactor operating pressure, i.e. bioreactors operated at 10 atmospheres of pressure need only
    be one tenth the volume of those operated at I atmosphere of pressure.
    [0143] By way of example, the benefits of conducting a gas-to-ethanol fermentation at
    elevated pressures has been described.      For example, WO 02/08438 describes gas-to-ethanol
    fermentations performed under pressures of 30 psig and 75 psig, giving ethanol productivities
10  of 150 g/1/day and 369 g/l/day respectively.         However, example fermentations performed
    using similar media and input gas compositions at atmospheric pressure were found to
    produce between 10 and 20 times less ethanol per litre per day.
    [01441 It is also desirable that the rate of introduction of the CO-containing gaseous substrate
    is such as to ensure that the concentration of CO in the liquid phase does not become limiting.
15  This is because a consequence of CO-limited conditions may be that one or more product is
    consumed by the culture.
    [0145] The composition of gas streams used to feed a fermentation reaction can have a
    significant impact on the efficiency and/or costs of that reaction.       For example, 02 may
    reduce the efficiency of an anaerobic fermentation process.          Processing of unwanted or
20  unnecessary gases in stages of a fermentation process before or after fermentation can
    increase the burden on such stages (e.g. where the gas stream is compressed before entering a
    bioreactor, unnecessary energy may be used to compress gases that are not needed in the
    fermentation).     Accordingly, it may be desirable to treat substrate streams, particularly
    substrate streams derived from industrial sources, to remove unwanted components and
25  increase the concentration of desirable components.
    [0146] In certain embodiments a culture of a bacterium of the invention is maintained in an
    aqueous culture medium. Preferably the aqueous culture medium is a minimal anaerobic
    microbial growth medium. Suitable media are known in the art and described for example in
    US patent no.s 5,173,429 and 5,593,886 and WO 02/08438, and as described in the Examples
30  section herein after.

    [0147] Also, if the pH of the broth was adjusted as described above to enhance adsorption of
    acetic acid to the activated charcoal, the pH should be re-adjusted to a similar pH to that of
    the broth in the fermentation bioreactor, before being returned to the bioreactor.

    [0148] Fermentation pathways of carboxydotrophic bacteria such as C. autoethanogenum, C.
    jungdahlii, or C. ragsdalei for production of ethanol and 2,3-butanediol were analyzed for
    bottlenecks using enzyme assays. For this, oxidoreductase reactions are particularly suitable,
    as they are coupled with one or more co-factors whose reduction or oxidation can be
10  measured. A synthetic redox dye such as methylviologen or benzylviologen can be used for
    this purpose as well.
    [01491 Oxidoreductase enzyme steps of the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway and fermentation
    pathways to ethanol and 2,3-butanediol were assayed to determine their activity.           The
    enzymes in these pathways are involved in autotrophic growth including uptake and
15  utilization of CO, CO 2 , and H2 gases as well as product formation.
    [01501 The enzymes assayed and their activities are detailed in figure 1. All assays performed
    were tested using a synthetic redox dye as control, either methyl viologen (MV) or benzyl
    viologen (BV). Co-factors ferredoxin (Fd), NADH and NADPH or a combination thereof was
    tested as described below. Enzyme assays were performed using crude extracts from a
20  fermentation as described below growing autotrophically on CO and hydrogen:
    Fermentation
    [0151] Fermentations with C. autoethanogenum were carried out in 1.5L bioreactors at 370 C

    Fermentation media containing per litre: MgCl, CaC 2 (0.5mM), KCI (2mM), H3 PO 4 (5mM),
25  Fe (100pM), Ni, Zn (SpM), Mn, B, W, Mo, Se(2 pM) was used for culture growth. The
    media was transferred into the bioreactor and autoclaved at 121 0 C for 45 minutes. After
    autoclaving, the media was supplemented with Thiamine, Pantothenate (0.05mg), Biotin
    (0.02mg) and reduced with 3mM Cysteine-HCI. To achieve anaerobicity the reactor vessel
    was sparged with nitrogen through a 0.2 pim filter. Prior to inoculation, the gas was switched
30  to CO-containing steel mill gas, feeding continuously to the reactor.             The feed gas

    maintained between 5 and 5.2.
    Harvesting of cells
    [0152] At the time of harvesting the cells (biomass of 3.9 g cells/ fermentation broth), the
 5  gas consumption was 5 moles CO L' day' and 10 milimoles H 2 L' day', with the following
    metabolites produced: 14 g L' day' Acetate and 19.5 g L' day-' Ethanol. The pH of the
    culture was adjusted to pH 6 with KCO3 and the reactor chilled in an ice-water bath.
    Approximately 1.2 L of culture was collected on ice. The culture was divided between two 1
    L centrifuge bottles (this and all subsequent steps were carried out in an anaerobic chamber to
10  ensure anoxic conditions to avoid inactivation of the enzymes) and cells pelleted at 5000 rpm
    for 10 min. The supernatant was decanted, and residual liquid removed. Each pellet was
    resuspended in approximately 30 mL of 50 mM K P0                4 pH 7.0 with 10 mM DTT.
    Resuspensions were transferred to pre weighed 50-mL-Falcon-tubes and cells repelleted at
    maximum speed (5000g) for 15 min. The tubes were removed from the anaerobic chamber
15  and immediately frozen on liquid N 2 before assaying.
    Preparationof crude cell extracts and enzyme assays
    [0153] Cells were harvested from a continuous reactor under anoxic conditions. They were
    disrupted by three passes through a French press as described by Huang et al. (2012).
    Unbroken cells and cell debris were removed by centrifugation at 20,000 x g and 4 *C for 30
20  min. The supernatant was used for enzyme assays. Except where indicated, all assays were
    performed at 370 C in 1.5-ml anaerobic cuvettes closed with a rubber stopper filled with 0.8
    ml reaction mixture and 0.7 ml N 2 or H2 or CO at 1.2 x 10' Pa as described by Huang et al.
    (2012). Enzymes were assayed as described below or by (Huang et al., (2012). After the start
    of the reaction with enzyme, the reduction of NAD(P)                 or NAD 4 was monitored
25  spectrophotometrically at 340 nm (c    = 6.2 mM 1 cm') or at 380 nm (s = 1.2 mM' cm'), C.
    pasteurianum ferredoxin reduction at 430 nm       (EAoId  ~ 13.1 mM> cm ), methyl viologen
    reduction at 578 nm (s = 9.8 mM-> cm-') and benzyl viologen reduction at 578 nm (t        = 8.6
    mM~1 cm>).
    [01541 CO dehydrogenase was measured using an assay mixture that contained 100 mM

    Results
    [0164] All oxidoreductase reactions in the pathways to ethanol and 2,3-butanediol of
    carboxydotrophic bacterium C. autoethanogenum were assayed and successfully detected,
    with the exception of the methylene-THF reductase which the inventors believe requires an
10  as yet unknown coupling site (K6pke et al., 2010; Poehlein et al., 2012), and activity of this
    enzyme couldn't be detected in other organisms previously. Results are provided in Figure 1
    and 2. This data was used to analyze and determine bottlenecks in these pathways that would
    typically occur during a fermentation process.
    Example 2 - Bottleneckfor ethanol production
15  [0165j As seen in the ethanol fermentation pathway depicted in figure 1, the bottleneck for
    ethanol production is the alcohol dehydrogenase reaction. While all other measured reactions
    showed at least an activity of 1.1 U/mg, the alcohol dehydrogenase reaction step has only a
    total activity of 0.35 U/mg (or 31%), 0.2 U/mg (18%) with NADH and 0.15 U/mg (13%)
    with NADPH. This is 69% less than all other reactions in the pathway. In a similar fashion,
20  the aldehyde dehydrogenase reaction had only a total activity of 0.16 U/mg (14%), 0.08
    U/mg (7%) with NADH and 0.08 U/mg (7%) with NADPH. This is 86% less than all other
    reactions in the pathway. This reaction however can be bypassed via acetate and the
    aldehyde:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (AOR) which has an activity of 1.9 U/mg and has the
    advantage of yielding ATP through substrate level phosphorylation in the acetate kinase
25  reaction thus providing more energy to the cell. To go at least some way towards overcoming
    this bottleneck and increasing efficiency of a fermentation reaction, an endogenous alcohol
    and/or    aldehyde dehydrogenase     enzyme     may be overexpressed      in a recombinant
    microorganism, or an exogenous alcohol and/or aldehyde dehydrogenase enzyme may be
    introduced and expressed.

    Example 3 - Increasing the flux through an ethanol production pathway by removing
    bottlenecks
    [0166] The reactions catalysing the conversion of acetyl-coA to acetaldehyde and from
    acetaldehyde to ethanol have been identified to be the rate limiting steps in ethanol formation
 5  in C autoethanogenum, C ljungdahlii, or C. ragsdalei.This can be overcome by either
    i.      overexpressing the native bifunctional alcohol / aldehyde dehydrogenase,
    ii.     expressing a heterologous bifunctional alcohol/ aldehyde dehydrogenase, or
    iii.    expressing a heterologous aldehyde dehydrogenase and an alcohol dehydrogenase.
    These outcomes can be achieved by using the methods described below.
10  Overexpressing the native bifunctional alcohol / aldehyde dehydrogenase in C.
    autoethanogenum
    [0167] It was chosen to overexpress the native bifunctional alcohol / aldehyde dehydrogenase
    gene of C autoethanogenurn (Sequence ID: 1) and express a heterologous bifunctional
    alcohol / aldehyde dehydrogenase gene of C acetobutylicum (Genbank nucleic acid ID:
15  CP002661.1 and amino acid sequence ID: AE134903. 1) in C. autoethanogenum.
    [01681 Genetic modifications were carried out using a plasmid pMTL83155 containing 487
    bp promoter sequence of C autoethanogenum phosphate acetyltransferase gene of C.
    autoethanogenum between Notl and Ndel restriction enzyme sites (as described in
    W02012053905). This plasmid was methylated in vivo using a novel methyltransferase and
20  then transformed into C autoethanogenun.
    Design, synthesis and cloning of codon altered C autoethanogenum bifnctional alcohol /
    aldehyde dehydrogenasegene
    [01691 The nucleic acid sequence of C. autoethanogenum bifunctional alcohol / aldehyde
    dehydrogenase gene was codon altered to suit to other Clostridia (Sequence ID: 2) and
25  synthesized. This is done to reduce the probability of homologous recombination between the
    chromosomal and episomal copies of the gene. The codon altered C autoethanogenum
    bifunctional alcohol / aldehyde dehydrogenase gene shams 81% sequence identity with that
    of the unaltered one. The codon altered gene is isolated using Ndel and Nhel restriction
    enzymes. The 2613 bp fragment is gel extracted using ZYMO Gel Extraction kit. The
30  plasmid pMTL83155 is also treated with Ndel and Nhel restriction enzymes followed by

    plasmid is cleaned using ZYMO Clean and Concentrate kit. Ligation is set with the cut insert
    and vector using T4 DNA ligase (Fermentas) for I h at 160C following which the ligation mix
    is used to transform E. coli TOP10 (Life Technologies). The TOP10 colonies are screened for
 5  plasmid with correct insert by plasmid isolation (ZYMO Plasmid Prep kit), restriction
    digestion with Ndel / Nhel enzymes and finally by sequencing.

    Blue MRF' Kan strain already containing plasmid pGS20m with methyltransferase gene.

10  [0171] The genomic DNA from C. acetobutylicum is isolated using Purelink Genomic DNA
    mini kit from Life Technologies, according to the manufacturer's instruction.       The C.
    acetobutylicum bifunctional alcohol / aldehyde dehydrogenase gene is PCR amplified using
    primers caBiAADH-F (Sequence ID: 7) and caBiAADH-R (Sequence ID: 8) and iProof DNA
    polymerase (BioRad). The primers contain Ndel and Nhel restriction enzyme sites. The
15  2589 bp PCR product is cleaned using ZYMO Clean and Concentrate kit. The PCR product
    and plasmid pMTL83155 is treated with Ndel and Nhel restriction enzymes (Fermentas).
    The plasmid is further treated with FASTAP alkaline phosphatase (Fermentas). The cut and
    phosphatase treated plasmid and cut PCR product are cleaned using ZYMO Clean and
    Concentrate kit. Ligation is set with the cut insert and vector using T4 DNA ligase
20  (Fermentas) for 1 h at 16"C following which the ligation mix is used to transform E. coli
    TOP10 (Life Technologies). The TOP10 colonies are screened for plasmid with correct insert
    by plasmid isolation (ZYMO Plasmid Prep kit), restriction digestion with Ndel / Nhel
    enzymes and finally by sequencing.

    Germany - SEQ ID No. 29 from W02012053905 using EcoRL. The resulting methylation
 5  plasmid pGS20-methyltransferase was introduced into E. coli XLI-Blue MRF' Kan strain
    (Stratagene) and this transformant was transformed again with plasmids pMTL83155
    cod.alt.naBiAADH and pMTL83155-caBiAADH. In vivo methylation was induced by
    addition of 1 mM IPTG, and methylated plasmids were isolated (Qiagen min prep kit) and
    used for electroporating C. autoethanogenum.

 5  anaerobic chamber and harvested at 4,700 x g and 4 *C. The culture was twice washed with
    ice-cold electroporation buffer (270 mM sucrose, I mM MgCI2, 7 mM sodium phosphate, pH
    7.4) and finally suspended in a volume of 600 pI fresh electroporation buffer. This mixture

 5  [0178] Fermentations are carried out in 1.5L bioreactors at 370 C and CO-containing steel
    mill gas as sole energy and carbon source as described below. A defined medium containing
    per litre: MgCl, CaCI 2 (0.5mM), KCI (2mM), H3PO 4 (5mM), Fe (100pM), Ni, Zn (5pM),
    Mn, B, W, Mo, Se(2 pM) is used for culture growth. The media is transferred into the
    bioreactor and autoclaved at 121 0 C for 45 minutes. After autoclaving, the medium is
10  supplemented with Thiamine, Pantothenate (0.05mg), Biotin (0.02mg) and reduced with
    3mM Cysteine-HCI.       To achieve anaerobicity the reactor vessel is sparged with nitrogen
    through a 0.2 pm filter. Prior to inoculation, the gas is switched to CO-containing steel mill
    gas, feeding continuously to the reactor. The feed gas composition is 2% H2            42% CO
    20% CO2 36% N 2. The pH of the culture is maintained between 5 and 5.2. The gas flow is
15  initially set at 80 ml/min, increasing to 200 ml/min during mid-exponential phase, while the
    agitation is increased from 200 rpm to 350. Na 2S is dosed into the bioreactor at 0.25 ml/hr.
    Once the OD600 reached 0.5, the bioreactor is switched to a continuous mode at a rate of 1.0
    ml/min (Dilution rate 0.96 d~'). When the growth is stable, the reactor is spiked with 10 g / L
    racemic mix of acetoin. Media samples are taken to measure the biomass and metabolites by
20  HPLC.
    [0179] Analysis of metabolites is performed by HPLC using an Agilent 1100 Series HPLC
    system equipped with a RID operated at 35 *C (Refractive Index Detector) and an Alltech
    IOA-2000 Organic acid column (150 x 6.5 mm, particle size 5 Pin) kept at 32 *C. Slightly
    acidified water is used (0.005 M H 2SO 4 ) as mobile phase with a flow rate of 0.25 ml/min. To
25  remove proteins and other cell residues, 400 pl samples are mixed with 100 pl of a 2 % (w/v)
    5-Sulfosalicylic acid and centrifuged at 14,000 x g for 3 min to separate precipitated residues.
    10 pl of the supernatant are then injected into the HPLC for analyses of key metabolites like
    ethanol, acetate, 2,3-butanediol and lactate.
    [0180] The rate-limiting reaction diverting acetyl-coA to ethanol in C autoethanogenum is
30  relieved due to the overexpression of codon altered native bifunctional alcohol / aldehyde
    dehydrogenase gene of C. autoethanogenum or because of expression of a heterologous C.

    (supplied by Fermentas) and Nhel (supplied by Fermentas) restriction enzymes. The 1152 bp
    fragment is gel extracted using ZYMO Gel Extraction kit. The plasmid pMTL83155 is also
    treated with Ndel and Nhel restriction enzymes followed by treatment with FASTAP

    [0188] Fermentation is carried out as explained in Example 1. The metabolites at different
    stages of fermentation are analysed by HPLC for ethanol, acetate, 2,3-butanediol and lactate.
    [0189] Similar to the expression of bifunctional alcohol/ aldehyde dehydrogenase, the rate
    limiting steps diverting acetyl-coA to ethanol in C autoethanogenum is relieved due to the
 5  expression of codon optimized Zymomonas mobilis aldehyde dehydrogenase gene and C
    bejerinckii alcohol dehydrogenase either individually or together in an operon. Thus an
    enhanced production flux to ethanol would be expected and a higher ethanol titer is produced
    in these genetically modified C autoethanogenumstrains.
    Example 4 - Bottleneck for 2,3-butanediol production
10  [0190] As seen in figure 2, the bottleneck for 2,3-butanediol production is the reaction from
    acetyl CoA to pyruvate catalysed by the pyruvate:ferredoxin reductase (PFOR) enzyme.
    While all other measured reactions showed at least an activity of 1.1 U/mg, this rate limiting
    reaction exhibited an enzyme activity of only 0.11 U/mg (10 %) in the presence of
    Ferredoxin. This is 90% less than all other reactions in the pathway. To go at least some
15  way towards overcoming this bottleneck and increase the product yield from the
    fermentation, an endogenous PFOR enzyme may be overexpressed or an exogenous PFOR
    enzyme may be introduced and expressed.
    Example 5 - Increasingtheflux through the 2,3-butanediolproductionpathway by
    removing bottlenecks
20  [0191] The reaction catalysing the conversion of acetyl-coA to pyruvate has been identified
    in figure 2 to be the rate limiting steps in 2,3-butanediol formation in C autoethanogenum, C
    jungdahlii, or C. ragsdalei. This can be overcome by overexpressing the gene that encodes
    the pyruvate: ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PFOR) in C autoethanogenum.               The gene is
    synthesised with codons to express a protein with the amino acid sequence of that found
25  natively in C. autoethanogenum (SEQ ID NO: 11).
    [0192] The gene is codon-optimized and synthesized in order to reduce homology to the
    native gene and avoid unwanted integration events and minimise issues with expression (SEQ
    ID NO: 12). The gene is flanked by restriction enzyme cut sites, XbaI (3'-end) and NheI (5'
    end) for subcloning into pMTL83155.            The synthesized construct and pMTL83155 are
30  digested with XbaI and NheI (Fermentas), and the pyruvate: ferredoxin oxidoreductase gene
    is ligated into pMTL83155 with T4 DNA ligase (Fermentas). The ligation mix is used to
                                                      45

    transform E. coli TOP1O (Invitrogen, LifeTechnologies) and colonies containing the desired
    plasmid are identified by plasmid miniprep (Zymo Research) and restriction digestion
    (Fermentas). The desired plasmid is methylated and transformed in C. autoethanogenum as
    described in example 3. Successful transformants are identified by thiamphenicol resistance
 5  and PCR analysis with primers repHF (SEQ ID NO: 13) and CatR (SEQ ID NO: 14) which
    will yield a 1584 base pair product when the plasmid is present.
    [0193] Transformants identified as containing the desired plasmid are grown in serum bottles
    containing PETC-MES media in the presence of mill gas, and their metabolite production,
    measured by HPLC analysis, is compared to that of a parent organism not harbouring the
10  plasmid. The PFOR activity in the transformed strain is also measured in crude extracts (as
    described in Example 1) to confirm that the observed bottleneck in the parent strain is
    alleviated. Overexpression of PFOR increases the overall activity within the cell, alleviating
    the bottleneck in the pathway, and leading to an increase in the flux through pyruvate, and an
    increase in 2,3-butanediol production.
15  Example 6 - Bottleneck to increase acetyl-CoA precursorfor increase of overall product
    yield
    [01941 As seen in figure I and 2, gases CO and H2 are readily utilized by the
    carboxydotrophic bacteria via carbon monoxide dehydrogenase,              hydrogenase, and/or
    formate:hydrogen lyase with an activity of 2.7 and 2.4 U/mg respectively.        However, the
20  measured enzymes of the methyl branch of the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway (formate
    dehydrogenase, methylene-THF dehydrogenase) show only around 1.1 U/mg activity. To
    increase the level of acetyl-CoA, the precursor for all downstream products, endogenous
    enzymes of the methyl branch of the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway (Formate dehydrogenase,
    Formyl-THF      synthetase,  Methylene-THF,     dehydrogenase/Formyl-THF       cyclohydrolase,
25  Methylene-THF reductase, Acetyl-CoA synthase) may be overexpressed or exogenous
    enzymes with substantially the same function may be introduced and expressed. Another
    strategy would be to increase the availability of required co-factors tetrahydrofolate and
    cobalamine by increasing expression of their biosynthesis genes.

    Example 7 - Relieving last Bottlenecks for optimized system to achieve better production
    andgrowth rates
    [0195] Previous examples describe how to optimize flux through the system including the
    Wood-Ljungdahl pathway and the ethanol and 2,3-Butanediol fermentation pathways to
 5  match the     activity of the carbon       monoxide dehydrogenase,      hydrogenase,     and/or
    formate:hydrogen lyase with an activity of 2.7 and 2.4 U/mg respectively.
    [01961 Having addressed these previous bottlenecks, the inventors now turn to a further rate
    limiting pathway reaction; the aldehyde:ferredoxin oxidoreducatse (AOR) reaction (see
    figure 1). This reaction has an activity of 1.9 U/mg, which is about 30% lower than the
10  activity of the carbon monoxide dehydrogenase.             As both the aldehyde:ferredoxin
    oxidoreductase (AOR) and the carbon monoxide dehydrogenase are one of the few enzymes
    that use ferredoxin as co-factor, it is particularly important to match the activities of both.
    This is because there is a finite pool of ferredoxin so the oxidation and reduction reactions
    cycling it should be balanced so as to ensure maximum efficiency of the cycle. The inventors
15  have found that this can be achieved             by overexpressing   the aldehyde:ferredoxin
    oxidoreductase gene (AORI - SEQ ID No. 16). Overexpression improved ethanol production
    by 31%. Relieving this bottleneck not only improved ethanol production by fermentation, but
    also improved growth rate of the organism as the ferredoxin pool is better balanced. Results
    are described in detail below.
20  Construction ofAORI expression plasmid
    [01971 The DNA        sequences of Wood-Ljungdahl promoter (PWL)          (Seq. ID. 15) and
    aldehyde::ferredoxin oxidoreductase 1 gene (AORI) (Seq, ID. 16) were amplified by PCR
    with oligonucleotides in Table 4 using Phusion High Fidelity DNA Polymerase (New
    England Biolabs) from genomic DNA of Clostridum autoethanogenum DSM10061. Genomic
25  DNA was isolated using a modified method by Bertram and Diltre (1989). A 100-ml
    overnight culture was harvested (6,000 x g, 15 min, 4 0 C), washed with potassium phosphate
    buffer (10 mM, pH 7.5) and suspended in 1.9 m1 STE buffer (50 mM Tris-HCI, 1 mM EDTA,
    200 mM sucrose; pH 8.0). 300 pl lysozyme (-100,000 U) were added and the mixture was
    incubated at 37 *C for 30 min, followed by addition of 280 pl of a 10 % (w/v) SDS solution
30  and another incubation for 10 min. RNA was digested at room temperature by addition of 240
    pl of an EDTA solution (0.5 M, pH 8), 20 pl Tris-HC (I M, pH 7.5), and 10 pl RNase A

    (Fermentas). Then, 100 pl Proteinase K (0.5 U) were added and proteolysis took place for 1-3
    h at 37 *C. Finally, 600 pl of sodium perchlorate (5 M) were added, followed by a phenol
    chloroform extraction and an isopropanol precipitation. DNA quantity and quality was
    inspected spectrophotometrically. The amplified 573 bp promoter Pwt was cloned into the E.
 5  coli-Clostridiumshuttle vector pMTL 83151 (GenBank accession number FJ797647; Heap et
    aL, 2009) using NotI and Ndel restriction sites and E. coli strain DH5a-TlR (Invitrogen),
    resulting in plasmid pMTL83157. Since the coding sequence of AOR1 contains two internal
    NdeI sites, splice overlapping (SOE) PCR (Warrens et al, 1997) was used to remove these
    NdeI sites without alteration of the codons. Both the 1849bp PCR product of AORI and
10  plasmid pMTL83157 were digested with NdeI and EcoR1, and ligated to produce plasmid
    pMTL83157-AORI (Seq. ID. 17). The insert and promoter of the expression plasmid
    pMTL83157-AORI were completely sequenced using oligonucleotides given in Table 4 and
    results confirmed that the two internal Ndel sites of AORl were successfully altered and they
    were free of mutations (Figure 3).

   Overexpression ofAORI in Clostridium autoethanogenum DSM10061:
   [0198] Plasmids    pMTL83157       and  pMTL83157-AORI  were   introduced  into   C.
5  autoethanogenum DSM10061 as described above. C. autoethanogenum transformants were

    selected using 7.5 pg/mL thiamphenicol. Colonies were observed after 3 days of incubation
    and they were restreaked onto the same selective agar media for purification. To check the
    identity of the transconjugants, PCR was carried to detect adhE1 (CAETHG_3747) of C.
    autoethanogenum       DSM10061       using   primers    adhEl-F      (Seq.    ID.    No.    28;

    GTAAATATTCAAATATCAACTTTACTGCTTCAAGGGC).                           Figure 4 shows the presence
    of the expected 576 bp product in both plasmid control and AORI overexpression strains.
    Furthermore, plasmid DNA was extracted from C. autoethanogenum transformants and
    transformed back into E. coli XLI-Blue MRF' (Stratagene) before plasmid restriction digest
10  analysis was carried out. This is commonly referred to as 'plasmid rescue' because plasmids
    isolated from Clostridiaare not of sufficient quality for restriction digest analysis. Figure 5
    shows the presence of the expected fragments following Ndel and KpnI digestions of rescued
    plasmids from pMTL83157-AOR I transformants.
    Overexpression ofAOR1 improves growth rate:
15  [0199] The ability of C. autoethanogenum plasmid control (pMTL83157) and AORI
    overexpression strains (pMTL83157-AOR1) to grow autotrophically in 100/         CO was tested
    in triplicates of 250 mL serum bottles containing 50 mL PETC media (Table 3) and
    pressurized with 30 psi CO. Thiamphenicol was supplemented to a final concentration 7.5
    pg/mL for the two plasmid harbouring strains. 400 pL of active culture was inoculated into
20  each serum bottle and liquid phase samples were harvested for OD measurements at a
    wavelength of 600nm and metabolite analysis by HPLC.
    [0200] Figure 6 shows that the overexpression of the enzyme AORI catalysing a rate limiting
    pathway reaction improves autotrophic growth of C. autoethanogenum DSM10061 relative to
    a plasmid control under 100% CO conditions. For instance, the AORI overexpression strain
25  reached a peak ODe     of 1.73 on day 13 whereas plasmid control only achieved a peak OD,,
    of 0.78 on day 22.
    Overexpression ojAORJ increases ethanolproduction of Clostridium autoethanogenum
    [0201] In addition, in 100% CO, AORI overexpression strain of C. autoethanogenum
    reached very similar ODeco of 1.7-1.8 as the C. autoethanogenum wild-type strain, but the
30  AORI overexpression strain of C autoethanogenum generated 31% more ethanol (Figure
    7A, squares, upper line at day 10) than the wild-type (crosses, lower line at day 10). Acetate
                                                  50

    production was similar between the recombinant microorganism (Figure 7B, squares, lower
    line at day 10 ) and the wild-type microorganism (Figure 7B, crosses, upper line at day 10),
    therefore the AOR overexpression strain produced around 30% higher overall product titers.
    [0202] In summary, the above example shows how the inventors have successfully
 5  demonstrated how to firstly identify rate-limiting pathway reactions and the associated
    enzymes/co-factors involved in that reaction.        Secondly the inventors have produced a
    recombinant microorganism in which the enzyme exhibits increased activity thus greatly
    increasing the rate of flux (and hence overall efficiency) through the fermentation pathway.
