                                            THERAPEUTIC HYDROGEN APPARATUS
 Background of the Invention
 [0001] This invention relates to a therapeutic hydrogen apparatus, being particularly adapted
 to facilitate the generation and delivery of hydrogen for therapeutic use in a subject' s home
 Description of the Prior Art
 [0002] "Therapeutic hydrogen" is a term that is rapidly gaining general awareness and
 scientific favour due to a growing body of international studies that are showing significant
 beneficial effects that hydrogen has on the body. Mounting evidence suggests that increasing
 the amount of molecular hydrogen in the body will improve the health and life span of the
 body' s mitochondria (cells) and also acts as a poweful antioxidant.
 [0003] The therapeutic effects of molecular hydrogen for a wide range of disease models
 have been investigated since 2007. A total of 321 original articles have been published from
 2007 to June 2015. Most studies have been conducted in Japan, China, and the USA. The
 number of clinical trials is increasing every year. In most diseases, the effect of hydrogen has
 been reported with hydrogen water or hydrogen gas, which was followed by confirmation of
 the effect with hydrogen-rich saline. Hydrogen water is mostly given ad libitum (as desired).
 Hydrogen gas of less than 4 % is given by inhalation.
 [0004] The effects have been reported in essentially all organs covering 31 disease categories
 that can be subdivided into 166 disease models, treatment-associated pathologies, and
 pathophysiological conditions of plants with a predominance of oxidative stress-mediated
 diseases and inflammatory diseases.
 [0005] The prominent and therapeutic effects of molecular hydrogen (H 2 gas) are emerging
 to the forefront of scientific research. A 2010 review article on molecular hydrogen published
 in Free Radical Research (Huang C.S., Kawamura T., Toyoda Y., Nakao A. (2010) "Recent
 advances in hydrogen research as a therapeutic medical gas", Free Radical Research,
 44(9):971-82 stated: "It is not an overstatement to say that hydrogen' s impact on therapeutic
 and preventive medicine could be enormous in the future."

 [0007] Therapeutic hydrogen apparatus have been proposed in the prior art, but conventional
 apparatus are generally targeted towards use in medical environments such as hospitals and
 are not suitable for facilitating the therapeutic use of hydrogen in a home of a subject.
 Accordingly, conventional apparatus fail to enable more widespread adoption of hydrogen
 therapy for ongoing or preventative treatments by subjects outside of intensive medical
 environments.
 [0008] US20150359979A1 discloses a hydrogen molecule therapy apparatus. The apparatus
 includes: a hydrogen molecule-containing gas generating unit which is configured to generate
 a hydrogen molecule-containing gas containing hydrogen molecule; a hydrogen molecule
 containing mist generating unit which is configured to generate a hydrogen molecule
 containing mist containing hydrogen molecule; and an outputting unit which is configured to
 simultaneously output the hydrogen molecule-containing gas generated by the hydrogen
 molecule-containing                        gas generating unit and the hydrogen molecule-containing mist
 generated by the hydrogen molecule-containing mist generating unit.
 [0009] US20150047634A1 discloses devices for delivering hydrogen to a subject comprising
 a flow path including a breather bag and an inhalation outlet for engagement with the subject
 respiratory system; and a breathing gas supply source comprising hydrogen gas and in fluid
 communication with the flow path. Also disclosed are devices for the cutaneous delivery of
 hydrogen.
 [0010] CN102068743A discloses a hydrogen therapeutic apparatus which comprises a water
 electrolysis hydrogen generator, an air chamber, two air blowers, an air storage chamber, a
 mixing chamber, a flow sensor and a hydrogen concentration monitor. Hydrogen generated
 by the water-electrolysis hydrogen generator is blown into the mixing chamber, and air is
 blown into the air storage chamber and then conveyed into the mixing chamber. The
 hydrogen/oxygen mixed gas is introduced into a conduit at a patient end and used for treating
 the patient. The hydrogen therapeutic apparatus takes advantage of the antioxidant, anti
 inflammation and anti-necrosis effects of hydrogen and can be used for treating and
 preventing multiple diseases.

 [0011] KR101574305B1 discloses a treatment apparatus capable of using hydrogen to treat
 inflammation while alleviating wrinkles and improving pore conditions. The treatment
 apparatus generates the hydrogen by using a hydrogen generator and uses a cooling apparatus
 to cool on order to increase the yield of the hydrogen gas while using the optimized hydrogen
 gas. The apparatus includes a spray nozzle to spray the hydrogen gas to the skin or to an
 affected area.

 Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiments
 [0055] An example of a therapeutic hydrogen apparatus 100 will now be described with
 reference to Figures 1A and 1B, which respectively show the apparatus 100 not in use and in
 use.
 [0056] In broad terms, the therapeutic hydrogen apparatus 100 includes a portable wheeled
 housing 110 having wheels 120, a hydrogen generator 130 for generating hydrogen gas by
 electrolysis and a delivery device 140 for delivering the hydrogen gas to allow hydrogen
 therapy to be provided to a subject. The hydrogen generator 130 is contained in the housing
  110, and the delivery device 140 is stored in the housing 110 when not in use.
 [0057] It will be appreciated that providing the hydrogen generator contained in a portable
 wheeled housing 110 will facilitate the generation and delivery of hydrogen for therapeutic
 use in a subject' s home.A subject may conveniently relocate the housing 110 using its
 wheels to thereby allow hydrogen gas to be generated in different locations as desired by a
 subject, such as in the subject' s bedroom, lounge oom, kitchen, bathroom or even outdoor
 areas. Thus, the subject may take advantage of hydrogen therapy in and around their daily
 activities.
 [0058] The portability of the apparatus 100 is further enhanced by providing for the storage
 of the delivery device 140 in the housing 110 when the delivery device is not in use. In the
 example of Figures 1A and 1B, the delivery device 140 is in the form of a diffuser 141 for
 generating bubbles of hydrogen gas in a fluid 101 such as water, in this case to enable
 hydrogen therapy to be provided by ingesting the resulting hydrogenated water. The bubbles
 of hydrogen gas may vary in size depending on the particular implementation, usage scenario
 or other requirements, but typically will include microbubbles and/or nanobubbles. Hydrogen
 gas generated by the hydrogen generator 130 is supplied to a reservoir 131, which is in turn
 supplied to the diffuser 141 via a connector 132 and tubing 142 as shown in Figure 1B. When
 the apparatus 100 is not in use to provide hydrogen therapy, the diffuser 141 and the tubing
  142 may be conveniently stored in the housing 110 as shown in Figure 1A.

IH:\stp\Intrwon\NRPortbl\DCC\STP\16154359_ .docx-12 12/2017
                                                            - 10
 [0059] However, it should be understood that the type of delivery device 140 depicted in
 Figures 1A and 1B has been selected for the purpose of illustration only, and the particular
 type of delivery device 140 is not intended to be limited. As will be discussed in further detail
 below, the delivery device 140 may be configured to deliver the hydrogen gas to a fluid,
 deliver the hydrogen gas to a breathing gas or deliver the hydrogen gas to a region of skin of
 the subject, for example. Further details of suitable delivery devices 140 will be discussed in
 due course. In any event, the delivery device 140 may be stored in the wheeled housing 110
 to provide a portable hydrogen therapy solution.
 [0060] Whilst a single delivery device 140 is shown in Figures 1A and 1B, it should be
 appreciated that the apparatus 100 may be provided with a plurality of delivery devices 140,
 which may be of different types or sizes. This can enable the apparatus 100 to be used for
 different forms of hydrogen therapy or even by different users. The provision of storage in
 the housing 110 will be even more convenient in such cases, because while one of the
 delivery devices 140 is in use, any other delivery devices 140 not currently in use may be
 stored in the housing 110.
 [0061] In some embodiments, the housing 110 may include a main compartment 111 for
 containing the hydrogen generator 130 and a storage compartment 112 for storing the
 delivery device 140. In this case the main compartment 111 occupies a majority of the
 internal volume of the housing 110 whilst the storage compartment is provided near the top
 of the housing. Preferably the storage compartment 112 is separated from the main
 compartment, to thereby allow the delivery device 140 to be kept away from the hydrogen
 generator 130 and other functional elements. This can avoid exposing the delivery device 140
 to heat or other conditions resulting from the hydrogen generation process, and will similarly
 avoid the need for the subject to be exposed to the same when removing or replacing the
 delivery device 140 in the storage compartment.
 [0062] In the present example, the housing 110 includes a door 113 that encloses the storage
 compartment 112 when the door 113 is closed and that allows access to the storage
 compartment 112 when the door 113 is opened. This can help to ensure the delivery device
  140 remains easily accessible yet provide for a neater appearance when the apparatus 100 is
 not in use.

 [0063] The housing 110 may include a plurality of wheels, and in some examples at least one
 of the wheels may include a brake or similar arrangement for selectively locking the housing
  110 in a stationary position and preventing unwanted rolling of the housing 110. The wheels
 may be suitably provided using commercially available castors, and preferably at last a pair
 of the wheels should be capable of swivelling for providing better rolling manoeuvrability.
 This allows for the apparatus 100 to be utilised throughout the home depending on the
 mobility or convenience of the subject at that time.
 [0064] Further optional features of the apparatus 100 will now be described with regard to
 the additional Figures.
 [0065] Figure 2 shows a specific arrangement of elements used in the generation of hydrogen
 gas by the hydrogen generator 130, along with examples of possible delivery devices 140 that
 may be used to delivery the generated hydrogen gas.
 [0066] The hydrogen generator 130 may include an electrolysis cell including active,
 negative and neutral plates separated by gaskets. In one implementation, the plates may be
 formed from stainless steel, whilst the gaskets may be formed from polytetrafluoroethylene
 (PTFE). The hydrogen generator 130 may operate using an electrolyte solution including
 water and sodium hydroxide. The combination plate and gasket materials have been selected
 with regard to the particular electrolyte solution, to help to resist corrosion or other
 undesirable chemical reactions which may inhibit the performance of the hydrogen generator
  130.
 [0067] In this particular example, the hydrogen generator is configured to generate molecular
 hydrogen (and oxygen) by means of electrolysis utilising a single active, dual negative and
 twelve neutral plate cell made from 1.5mm 316L stainless steel. A plate size of 180mm x
  110mm has been selected in this example. The gaskets are made from PTFE to compliment
 the stainless steel and the electrolyte used. The electrolyte may be produced from distilled (or
 demineralised) water with a measured amount of sodium hydroxide (such as 1 tablespoon per
 2.5L) which will allow a current of 7-8A to be utilised from a suitably transformed 15V DC
 power supply. The volume of gas produced may be controlled by the use of a pulse width
 modulator to vary the current, thus allowing for different applications.

                                                            -12
 [0068] The selected combination of hydrogen generator plate size (180mm x 110mm),
 number of neutral plates (12), configuration of positive (1) and negative plates (2), voltage
 (15), current (7-8A) and strength of electrolyte solution (2 teaspoons per 2.5L), produces a
 hydrogen and oxygen gas (Hydroxide), at a volume of approximately 700ml per minute and
 an operating temperature of approximately 40 degrees Celsius.
 [0069] Embodiments of the apparatus 100 may include an electrolyte reservoir 231 and a
 scrubber reservoir 233. In this particular example, the apparatus 100 is configured so that an
 electrolyte solution is supplied from the electrolyte reservoir 231 to the hydrogen generator
  130 via flow path 251. Hydrogen gas generated by the electrolysis cell of the hydrogen
 generator 130 is initially and diffused through the electrolyte reservoir 231 via flow path 252
 and is subsequently diffused through the scrubber reservoir 232 via flow path 253. Then, the
 hydrogen gas may be supplied from the scrubber reservoir 232 to the delivery device 140 via
 flow path 254.
 [0070] In this example, the electrolyte reservoir 231 supplies the hydrogen cell of the
 hydrogen generator 130 with the electrolyte solution via gravity through a single entry point
 at the base of the hydrogen cell and the hydrogen gas is harvested from two exit points at the
 top of the hydrogen cell. The generated hydrogen gas (and co-generated oxygen gas) is then
 diffused back through the electrolyte reservoir 231 via piping, allowing the gas to re-enter the
 electrolyte reservoir 231 at the bottom of the electrolyte reservoir 231 and then pass through
 the scrubber reservoir 232 adjacent the electrolyte reservoir 231 before being supplied to the
 delivery device 140 for use by the subject.
  [0071] The electrolyte reservoir 231 may be filled with the electrolyte solution via an
 electrolyte fill point 233, whilst the scrubber reservoir 232 may be filled with distilled water
 or other suitable scrubber fluid via a scrubber fill point 234. Generated hydrogen gas may be
 supplied to the delivery device 130 via a hydrogen gas discharge point 235.
 [0072] The volume of gas generated by the hydrogen generator 130 is determined by the
 surface area of the plates used in the hydrogen cell and the current determined by the strength
 of the electrolyte solution. Heat is produced during the hydrogen generation process and the
 current needs to be controlled to keep the apparatus cool whilst still maintaining appropriate

 volumes of gas production for use. The apparatus 100 may be carefully designed ensure high
 safety whilst extending the operational lifespan of the apparatus 100.
 [0073] As mentioned above, Figure 2 also illustrates some example configurations of
 delivery devices 140 for facilitating the provision of hydrogen therapy to the subject using
 the hydrogen gas generated by the hydrogen generator 130. These examples relate to three
 different methods of hydrogen therapy, namely by the subject ingesting drinking water that
 has been enriched with the hydrogen gas, the subject inhaling a breathing gas mixture
 including the hydrogen gas, or the subject directly applying the hydrogen gas to the skin of
 the subject.
 [0074] In some examples, the delivery device 140 may be configured to deliver the hydrogen
 gas to a fluid. In Figure 2, one example delivery device 140 includes a diffuser 141 for
 generating bubbles of hydrogen gas in the fluid 101 as per the example of Figures 1A and 1B.
 In this case the fluid is drinking water, whereby the supply of hydrogen gas into the drinking
 water via the diffuser 141 produces hydrogenated water, which may be ingested by the
 subject as a form of hydrogen therapy. In one implementation, the diffuser 141 is a two
 micron discharge diffuser. In alternative examples, the hydrogen gas may be delivered to a
 fluid within a sufficiently large container to allow at least a portion of the subject to be
 immersed within the hydrogenated fluid as a means of applying hydrogen to the skin. For
 instance, hydrogen gas may be delivered into a bath or other large body of water to allow
 bathing in the hydrogen enriched water.
 [0075] It should be appreciated that a diffuser 141 as discussed above may be used to infuse
 hydrogen into water or any other fluid 101 on variable scales such as baths, pools or even an
 entire water supply to premises. In some examples, the diffuser may be particularly adapted
 for use a drinking water fountain or other water delivery facility. In some implementations, a
 diffuser 141 may be combined with water filtration and cooling/chilling functionalities.
 Embodiments of the apparatus 100 could also be utilised to enrich water within a header tank
 that would supply water for various consumption such as household water supply, central
 reservoir for hydroponic cultivation facilities, food preparation facilities to extend shelf life
 of products such as fruits and vegetables or seafood preparation and cleaning.

 [0076] The scale of this infusion method should not be limited with infusion capabilities
 envisaged beyond 100,000 litres per hour.
 [0077] In other examples, the delivery device 140 may be configured to deliver the hydrogen
 gas in a breathing gas mixture. In Figure 2, one example delivery device 140 includes a
 breathing adaptor 242 for allowing a subject 201 to inhale a breathing gas including hydrogen
 gas. Thus, hydrogen therapy may be provided to the subject 201 by absorption of inhaled
 hydrogen gas via the subject' slungs. In this example, the breathing adaptor 242 is in the form
 of a breathing mask, but other examples may use alternative forms of the breathing adaptor
 242, such as a mouthpiece or a nasal cannula. In some implementations, the delivery device
  140 may include a mixer (not shown) for mixing the hydrogen gas and the breathing gas at a
 predetermined mixture ratio. This can help to ensure the breathing gas is safe for inhalation
 by the subject without risk of asphyxiation of the subject.
  [0078] In yet other examples, the delivery device may be configured to deliver the hydrogen
 gas to a region of skin of the subject. In Figure 2, one example delivery device 140 includes a
 skin applicator 243, which is adapted for direct application of the hydrogen gas to the skin of
 the subject. In this example, the skin applicator 243 is generally dome shaped having an
 enlarged opening that can be applied to the subject to cover a region of skin so that the
 covered region is exposed to a hydrogen gas rich atmosphere, whereby hydrogen gas may be
 absorbed through the skin barrier to provide hydrogen therapy. In some implementations, a
 delivery device 140 in the form of a skin applicator may be provided as part of a garment to
 be worn by the subject. The garment may include a porous bladder or porous tubing into
 which hydrogen gas may be supplied so that the hydrogen gas can be released to the subject' s
 skin beneath the garment.
  [0079] As mentioned above, one or more delivery devices 140 may be stored in a storage
 compartment 112 of the apparatus 100, which may be located near the connector 132 through
 which hydrogen gas is discharged as shown in Figures 1A and 1B. Preferably, each delivery
 device 140 will have large user friendly quick connect fittings to allow for easy interchange
 of delivery devices 140 depending on the subject' sneeds. In some implementations, multiple
 delivery devices 140 may be provided that can use the same tubing 142.

IH:\stp\Intrwon\NRPortbl\DCC\STP\16154359_ .docx-I2 12/2017
                                                            - 15
 [0080] Other possible forms of delivery devices 140 may allow for diffusion of hydrogen gas
 into large water containers such as baths, limb encapsulating garments such as socks and
 gloves that will allow direct application to the skin, positively fed air devices and masks to
 treat sleep apnoea and breathing focussed therapies. It should be appreciated that there are
 many circumstances that may require molecular hydrogen ingestion to be concentrated in a
 certain manner to achieve a particular result. After a successful treatment of a particular
 ailment, the ingestion method may be altered to allow the body to maintain a healthy level of
 hydrogen benefit and keep the particular ailment in a remissive state.
 [0081] Whilst the subject will typically be a human subject, it should be noted that the
 apparatus 100 is not necessarily exclusively for human use, and may be used to provide
 hydrogen therapy to a non-human subject. For instance, the apparatus 100 may be used to
 generate therapeutic hydrogen for treating an animal. In such cases, the delivery devices 140
 may be specifically adapted for use by particular animals. For example, a delivery device 140
 may be provided in the form of a breathing adaptor to suit a canine or feline animal. In other
 examples, the apparatus 100 may be used to provide hydrogen enriched water for other
 purposes, such as for washing food products prior to consumption or for watering plants.
 [0082] Further optional implementation details of an embodiment of the apparatus 100 will
 now be described with regard to Figures 3A and 3B, which includes the hydrogen generation
 elements previously described with regard to Figure 2.
 [0083] In this embodiment, the storage compartment 112 is located in a top portion of the
 housing 110. The door 113 is inclined when closed and is configured to open upwardly about
 a hinge located at the top of the housing. A handle 311 is fitted to the housing 110 to
 facilitate movement of the housing 110 by the subject.
 [0084] The hydrogen generator 130 is located in a lower region of the main compartment 111
 of the housing 110, whilst the electrolyte reservoir 231 and the scrubber reservoir 232 are
 located above the hydrogen generator 130 and behind the storage compartment 112. The
 electrolyte fill point 233, scrubber fill point 234 and hydrogen gas discharge point 235 are
 located on top of the housing 110 to enable convenient filling and connection to the
 generated hydrogen gas. Flow paths 251, 252, 253, 254 as discussed previously with regard

 to Figure 2 are also indicated in Figures 3A and 3B. In addition, this embodiment includes
 drainage discharge valves 336 for facilitating drainage of the electrolyte solution and/or the
 scrubber fluid.
 [0085] The drainage discharge valves 336 and associated service points are located near the
 base of the housing 110 and may be easily controlled by the maintainer. A diluted vinegar
 solution may be used to clean and flush the hydrogen cell of the hydrogen generator 130,
 electrolyte reservoir 131 and scrubber reservoir 132 every 3-6 months depending on usage.
 The apparatus 100 may then be flushed 2-3 times with distilled or demineralised water before
 being refilled through the easily accessed filling points 233, 234 at the top of the housing
  110, primed with electrolyte and put back into commission.
 [0086] In this embodiment, the apparatus 100 also includes a power supply 221 (150W
 switch mode 15V DC in this case), a cooling fan 222, and a switch panel 223 for controlling
 the operation of the hydrogen generator 130.
 [0087] As mentioned above, both the electrolyte and the 316L stainless steel plates of the
 hydrogen generator have been chosen to ensure a non-corrosive partnership between products
 and a subsequently long operating life span. The housing 110 itself may also be made from
 the same 316L stainless steel material ensuring long life in all conditions.
 [0088] Further details of the electrical configuration of the apparatus 100 will now be
 described with regard to Figure 4.
 [0089] Mains 240V AC power supplied via mains plug 404 may be utilised to run the
 cooling fan 322 and is connected via a mains power isolation point 401 to the 15V DC power
 supply 321 that powers the hydrogen generator 130. The mains power isolation point 401
 may be provided as part of the aforementioned switch panel 223 together with a generator
 power off switch 402 and a generator power on switch 403.
 [0090] The apparatus 100 may further include safety elements such as dual power isolation
 points, a timer controller 423, an over heating shut down relay 424 and a temperature switch
 405. The apparatus 100 may also include a pilot light 431 for indicating operation of the
 hydrogen generator 130. The timer controller 423 may be configured to deactivate the

 hydrogen generator 130 after a predetermined period of operation, such as 23 minutes in one
 example.
 [0091] Further optional configurations of the apparatus 100 will now be discussed with
 regard to Figures 5A to 5D which show photographs of a prototype implementation of the
 apparatus 100 described above.
 [0092] Figure 5A shows the apparatus 100 which has a stainless steel housing 110 including
 a door 113 in a closed position and castor wheels 120. In this example, handles 311 are
 mounted on side walls of the housing 110. The cooling fan 222 is mounted in a side of the
 housing 110 and the drainage discharge valves 336 may be accessed on the same side near
 the base of the housing 110. A switch panel 223 including the mains power isolation point
 401, the generator power off switch 402, the generator power on switch 403 and the pilot
 light 431 are provided on the front of the housing 110 beneath the door 113. The hydrogen
 gas discharge point 235 and reservoir fill points are located on the top of the housing 110
 above the door 113.
 [0093] Figure 5B shows the apparatus 100 with the door 113 in the open position revealing
 the storage compartment 112 of the housing 110 inside. In this case, a delivery device 140
 including tubing is stored in the storage compartment 112.
 [0094] Figure 5C shows a rear view of the apparatus 100, with a rear panel of the housing
  110 removed to expose the contents of the main compartment 111 of the housing 110. The
 hydrogen generator 130 is mounted on the base of the housing 110, whilst the electrolyte
 reservoir 231 and the scrubber reservoir 232 are mounted in a top portion of the housing 110
 such that the electrolyte fill point 231 and the scrubber fill point 232 are accessible from
 outside the top of the housing 110. Generated hydrogen gas is discharged from the scrubber
 reservoir 232 at the hydrogen gas discharge point 235 located between the two fill points 233,
 234. The location of the drainage discharge valves 336 near the base of the housing 110 can
 be seen, together with the internal positioning of the power supply 321 and the cooling fan
 322.
 [0095] Figure 5D also shows a rear view of the apparatus 100 with the rear panel removed
 but in this case a number of elements have been removed including the hydrogen generator

  130, the electrolyte reservoir 231 and the scrubber reservoir 232, to allow other elements
 within the main compartment to be seen. In particular, the mains plug 404 can be seen near
 the base of the housing 110, along with previously mentioned the timer controller 423 and the
 over heating shut down relay 424 and a 240V AC to 15V DC power transformer 501.
 [0096] As shown in Figure 6, the electrolyte reservoir 231 and the scrubber reservoir 232
 may be provided in an assembly for easy removal from the housing 110 of Figures 5A to 5D.
 The two reservoirs are connected by a mounting plate 601 having the electrolyte filler point
 531 and the scrubber filler point 532 protruding from the plate such that the plate 601 may be
 mounted inside a top panel of the housing 110 with the filler points 531, 532 extending
 outside of the housing through appropriately configured holes.
 [0097] Figure 7 shows further details of the hydrogen generator 130, which has been
 removed from the housing 110 of Figures 5A to 5D. In this embodiment, the hydrogen
 generator 130 includes a gas harvest discharge point 701 near the top and an electrolyte
 supply and drainage point 702 near the bottom. The hydrogen cell plates of the hydrogen
 generator 130 are provided in a layered arrangement interspersed with gaskets. In particular,
 the hydrogen cell includes a positive DC power plate 703 associated with a single plate at the
 centre of the hydrogen cell and two negative DC power plates 704 at the outer layers of the
 hydrogen cell. Twelve neutral plates 705 are arranged between the positive and negative
 power plates 703, 704.
 [0098] An alternative embodiment of the apparatus 800 will now be described with regard to
 Figures 8 and 9.
 [0099] It should be noted that this version of the apparatus 800 as shown in Figure 8 is
 similar to the previously described embodiment shown in Figures 3A and 3B, but includes
 some additional optional features. Features that are common to both embodiments have been
 assigned the same reference numerals and their functionalities will be generally as described
 above, except if noted otherwise.
 [0100] As per the previous examples, the embodiment of the apparatus 800 of Figure 8
 includes a portable wheeled housing 110 having wheels 120, a hydrogen generator 130 for

IH:\stp\Intrwon\NRPortbl\DCC\STP\16154359_ .docx-12 12/2017
                                                            - 19
 generating hydrogen gas by electrolysis and a delivery device (not shown in Figure 8) for
 delivering the hydrogen gas to allow hydrogen therapy to be provided to a subject.
 [0101] In this case, the apparatus 800 includes a filter 801 for filtering the generated
 hydrogen gas after exiting the scrubber 232 along flow path 254 and before being discharged
 at the hydrogen gas discharge point 235.
 [0102] In addition, the apparatus 800 also includes a water condensation valve 802 for
 allowing water condensation that may accumulate with the generated hydrogen gas to be
 selectively discharged. Water condensation will flow along flow path 802 and may be
 discharged from the same point as the electrode solution drainage discharge valve 336. In this
 example, the water condensation valve 802 is a push spring return valve.
 [0103] The electrical elements of the apparatus 800 of Figure 8 are shown in Figure 9, and it
 will be noted that the electrical elements are similar to those described above with regard to
 Figure 4, with common features between the different versions being assigned the same
 references numerals and having generally equivalent functionalities.
 [0104] Whilst the previous example of Figure 4 included a timer controller 423, the present
 example of Figure 9 includes a digital timer 901 which adds the capability of allowing more
 sophisticated time-based control including periodic generation and application of therapeutic
 hydrogen.
 [0105] Furthermore, in place of the over heating shut down relay 424 of the previous
 example, the present example includes a pulse width modulation (PWM) controller 902. The
 PWM controller 902 may be configured to regulate the current supplied to the hydrogen
 generator 130 and hence the hydrogen gas production rate, and can also be used to provide
 thermal protection by controlling the current based on temperature measurements.
 [0106] In this example, the apparatus 800 also includes a circuit breaker 903 to provide an
 additional electrical safeguard, and a light emitting diode (LED) light array 904 for providing
 visual indications of the apparatus operational conditions.

 [0107] Another alternative embodiment of the apparatus 1000 will now be described with
 regard to Figures 10A to 1OC, 11, 12 and 13.
 [0108] This particular embodiment of the apparatus 1000 also includes a portable wheeled
 housing 110 having wheels 120, a hydrogen generator 130 for generating hydrogen gas by
 electrolysis and a delivery device for delivering the hydrogen gas to allow hydrogen therapy
 to be provided to a subject. In this case, the delivery device is in the form of an infuser pump
 arrangement that is capable of enriching 16-25 litres of water per minute with hydrogen. The
 infuser pump used in this embodiment is a nanobubble generating gas infuser pump that is
 rated for production of at least 80% of its bubbles in nano size. Whilst the generation of
 nanobubbles may be preferred in some applications, it should be appreciated that this is not
 essential and alternative embodiments may be provided for generating microbubbles.
  [0109] The infuser pump arrangement includes an infuser pump 1020 that receives water
 from a water source via a water inlet 1002 and infuses the water with hydrogen gas generated
 by the hydrogen generator 130, with the resulting hydrogen enriched water being provided
 for use via a hydrogenated water outlet 1003. The infuser pump 1020 may be driven by an
 electric motor 1030.
  [0110] Despite this additional functionality, the apparatus 1000 remains relatively small,
 portable and available as a combined hydrogen generator and water infusion device that is
 also able to be utilized for direct gas inhalation or direct application to the surface of the
 biological system in question, as per the previous examples.
 [0111] It is noted that Figure 10A shows the hydrogen generation elements and the infuser
 pump arrangement as packaged together in the portable wheeled housing 110, whereas the
 hydrogen generation elements have been hidden from view in Figures 10B and 10C. On the
 other hand, Figure 11 shows the hydrogen generation elements and the infuser pump
 arrangement in a schematic view for allowing the interconnections between the different
 elements to be better appreciated.
 [0112] As shown in Figure 12, the infuser pump arrangement may be connected to a body of
 fluid via the water inlet 1002 and hydrogenated water outlet 1003 using hoses to facilitate

IH:\stp\Intrwon\NRPortbl\DCC\STP\16154359_ .docx-12 12/2017
                                                            - 21
 circulation or ' in line" water gas enrichment.Further details in this regard will be discussed
 in due course.
 [0113] Flow control for both the hydrogen gas and water is required for optimal infusion
 rates and may be facilitated by means of a pulse width modulator (PWM) controller 902 as
 discussed in the previous example, to thereby control gas production. Multi-turn valves may
 also be used to control fluid flow, pressures and vacuum rates.
 [0114] In some embodiments, the functionalities of the apparatus 1000 may be selectively
 applied, for instance there may be an ability to operate the infuser pump arrangement with or
 without the use of generated molecular hydrogen (i.e. by alternatively allowing for air
 infusion), or the hydrogen generator 130 may be used with or without the infuser pump
 arrangement.
 [0115] With regard to different views of the apparatus 1000 as shown in Figures 10A to 1OC,
 it is noted that the hydrogen generation elements of the apparatus 1000 are generally the
 same as the earlier described embodiment of the apparatus 800 as shown in Figure 8, but in
 this case, rather than discharging generated hydrogen for delivery via a hydrogen discharge
 point 235, the generated hydrogen proceeds from the filter 801 towards the infuser pump
 arrangement along flow path 1055. The generated hydrogen passes through a hydrogen flow
 meter 1006 and may be mixed with air received from the environment via air port 1001
 which passes along flow path 1056 through an air flow meter 1005. It should be understood
 that mixing the generated hydrogen with air is optional. In some scenarios, only air may be
 supplied to the infuser pump 1020 by turning off the flow of hydrogen gas.
 [0116] The hydrogen gas (or hydrogen-air mixture) may be supplied along flow path 1057 to
 the infuser pump 1020 via a flow controller 1022 which may be adjust the flow rate of the
 hydrogen gas in accordance with the supply of water to the infuser pump 1020. As mentioned
 above, the infuser pump 1020 receives water at a water input 1021 from a water source via
 the water inlet 1002, with the flow of water being along flow path 1061. A water flow meter
  1008 may be used to measure the flow rate of the received water and this measurement may
 be used by the flow controller 1022 to adjust the hydrogen flow rate accordingly.

 [0117] The infuser pump 1020, which may be driven by an electric motor 1030, will pump
 the received water and infuse it with generated hydrogen, with the hydrogenated water being
 supplied from the infuser pump 1020 at the hydrogenated water output 1023. The
 hydrogenated water will flow along flow path 1062 to a storage tank 1010, and this flow rate
 may be measured by another water flow meter 1007. The hydrogenated water may be
 discharged from the storage tank 1010 along flow path 1064 for use via the hydrogenated
 water outlet 1003.
  [0118] In some examples, water from the water inlet 1002 may be allowed to bypass the
 infuser pump 1020 and flow directly into the storage tank 1010 along flow line 1063, by
 operation of bypass valve 1004. This may allow flushing of the storage tank 1010, for
 instance. An optional drain valve 1005 may be provided for allowing the storage tank 1010 to
 be drained for servicing.
  [0119] As mentioned above, the hydrogen generator 130 and infuser pump 1020 may be
 selectively applied depending on operational requirements, and this may be facilitated by
 providing an power controller 1101 that allows electrical power from the connected mains
 plug to be selectively applied to the hydrogen generator 130 and/or the infuser pump 1020 by
 operating respective power switches, or the like.
  [0120] An example of a potential usage of the apparatus 1000 for infusing a body of fluid
 with hydrogen gas will now be described with regard to Figure 12. In this case, the body of
 fluid is provided in the form of a water tank 1210. The volume of the water tank 1210 may be
 scaled according to the hydrogen generation capability of the apparatus 1000 and the desired
 hydrogen concentration. For instance, a water tank with a volume capacity of between 200L
 and 3000L may be used.
  [0121] The water tank 1210 may be filled by a filling line 1201, and the filling operation may
 be automatically controlled using a float valve 1211 as shown. Water can be discharged from
 the water tank 1210 via tank outlet 1202 and supplied to the water inlet 1002 of the apparatus
  1000 for hydrogen infusion. In this example, the water is passed through a water filter 1220
 as shown, to help to prevent introducing contaminants into the apparatus 1000.

                                                            - 23
 [0122] The water will be infused with hydrogen in the apparatus 1000 using the hydrogen
 generator 130 and the infuser pump arrangement as discussed above, and the hydrogenated
 water that is produced as a result will be supplied from the apparatus 1000 at the
 hydrogenated water outlet 1003. The hydrogenated water may in turn be delivered from the
 hydrogenated water outlet 1003 back to the water tank 1210 or to another receptacle as
 required. In this case, the hydrogenated water is supplied via a tank inlet 1203 and introduced
 into the water tank at a discharge point 1230.
 [0123] A separate pump 1240 may be provided for pumping hydrogenated water from the
 water tank 1210 via flow path 1204 and supplying the hydrogenated water for use along flow
 path 1205. The water tank 1210 may also include a vent 1212 for venting hydrogen gas that
 does not remain in solution.
 [0124] The electrical elements of the apparatus 1000 of Figures 1OA to 1OC and 11 are
 shown in Figure 13, and it will be noted that these electrical elements are similar to those
 described above with regard to Figure 9, with common features between the different
 versions being assigned the same references numerals and having generally equivalent
 functionalities.
 [0125] In this case, the main electrical difference compared to the previous example of
 Figure 9 is the inclusion of the power controller 1101 for allowing electrical power to be
 selectively applied to the hydrogen generator 130 and/or the infuser pump 1020.
  [0126] Embodiments with a built-in infuser pump arrangement may be used in various
 scalable applications for both domestic and commercial purposes. The apparatus 100 is able
 to be utilised for the ability to treat a multitude of biological systems or organisms such as in
 agriculture, horticulture and aquaculture through the administration of supplemental levels of
 molecular hydrogen and oxygen via the various methods suited to the system in question and
 the scale required.
  [0127] In view of the above, it will be appreciated that the apparatus provides a single
 portable device that enables the subject to administer the therapeutic benefits of molecular
 hydrogen in any manner that best suits the user and the particular ailment, relief or assistance

 they require. The apparatus may be easily used in the privacy and comfort of the subject' s
 own home and may be easily maintained using readily available products.
 [0128] It should be understood that since molecular hydrogen stabilises and dissipates into
 the atmosphere after its generation, it is preferable that it be generated and used on demand
 and as required. Accordingly, the therapeutic hydrogen apparatus 100 has been deliberately
 engineered for its ease of use and diversity of application.
 [0129] The apparatus may be provided with a range of different types of delivery devices for
 enabling hydrogen therapy to be provided to subjects using different delivery mechanisms.
 This may allow the apparatus to specifically address each particular ailment or illness that
 requires an increased concentration of molecular hydrogen. Examples of delivery devices
 include bubble diffusers which may be used to diffuse hydrogen gas into drinking water or
 larger bodies of fluids such as baths, breathing masks or the like, skin applicators, and
 specific skin applicator garments such as gloves, socks or body suits.
 [0130] The apparatus provides a user friendly, portable hydrogen gas generator that will
 allow the subject to be able to provide for themselves sufficient volumes of hydrogen for
 personal use in their own home while enabling the subject the freedom to administer via
 water enrichment, inhalation or direct application to the skin. This versatility of ingestion
 allows for the entirety of therapeutic benefits to be accessed by the user with one apparatus
 and for whatever benefit he or she requires.
 [0131] Throughout this specification and claims which follow, unless the context requires
 otherwise, the word "comprise", and variations such as "comprises" or "comprising", will be
 understood to imply the inclusion of a stated integer or group of integers or steps but not the
 exclusion of any other integer or group of integers.
 [0132] Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that numerous variations and modifications
 will become apparent. All such variations and modifications which become apparent to
 persons skilled in the art, should be considered to fall within the spirit and scope that the
 invention broadly appearing before described.
