5.0       Abstract
The Self Aligning Pressurised Oil (SAPO) Seal utilises pressurised oil as the sealing
medium. It has the capacity to maintain parallel alignment with the shaft when the housing
that it is mounted on is misaligned radially, vertically and horizontally.
Current sealing methods use grease to fill the voids within a labyrinth seal. The labyrinth
grooves are required to be sufficiently large to allow for the abovementioned misalignment.
This grease that is meant to operate as a sealing medium becomes contaminated resulting
in the lubrication within the housing also becoming contaminated, causing premature bearing
failure.
The Self Aligning Pressurised Oil (SAPO) Seal uses pressurised oil (0.5 Bar/50kPa
minimum) between two oil seals to provide a contamination barrier from the external
environment to maintain clean lubricant within the bearing housing.

                    Self-Aligning Pressurised Oil (SAPO) Seal
1.0      Current Labyrinth Seals
For many years, labyrinth seals commonly used in conveyor applications have utilised
grease as a sealing medium. Due to the misalignment requirements, the labyrinth grooves
have a significant clearance that the grease must fill in order to stop the ingress of
contamination. This contamination usually comprises of:
     *    Fine dust/abrasive material (usually the product being conveyed)
     *    Water (from external sources such as high pressure washing and exposure to the
          environment)
The current method for minimising this ingress is to utilise a labyrinth that is filled with grease
to mitigate the contamination ingress.
These seals (Photos 1 & 2) are ineffective at maintaining an adequate seal even with the
installation of automated greasing lines.
Bearing failure analysis on numerous pulley failures clearly indicates the grease does not act
as a barrier for contamination, but it is the carrier (Photos 3 & 4).
Any dust or contaminant that contacts the grease lubricant that is used to seal these
labyrinths has a tendency to become 'mixed' due to the rotation. This mixing results in the
labyrinth sealing medium becoming contaminated which then enters the bearing housing
cavity (Photos 3 & 4).

2.0     SAPO Seal Component Description
There are two key components that make the SAPO Seal innovative:
     1. The Alignable Carrier
     2. The Pressurised Oil Sealing Medium
2.1     The Alignable Carrier
The purpose of the carrier is to locate two contact lip style oil seals filled with oil in a cavity
between them that is maintained under pressure.
The SAPO Seal Carrier has many requirements to fulfil in order to maintain a positive seal
with respect the shaft. These requirements are:
     1. Misalignment in three (3) axes - vertical, horizontal and radial
        The SAPO Seal is required to maintain a positive seal whilst accommodating these
        three (3) misalignment axes.
     2. Parallelism with the shaft
        The seal must accommodate these various misalignments whilst maintaining
        parallelism with the shaft.
The SAPO Seal has the ability to misalign on the housing face horizontally and vertically as
well as maintaining parallelism with the shaft by having the ability to misalign radially within
its own Cartridge.
The SAPO Seal (Figure 1) comprises of three primary items:
     *  Outer seal carrier (Item 1 - mounts to housing face)
     *  Inner seal carrier (Item 2 - Alignable Inner Seal Carrier)
     e  Oil Seals (Item 3 - Oil Seals)
2.2     The Pressurised Oil Sealing Medium
Within the Inner Seal Carrier component are holes to allow for oil filling and air purging. The
holes are required for:
      " Filling the void between seals (circled red - Figure 2);
      * Purging air from the void;
      * Attaching pressurised oil source.

Item 1 - Bearing Housing
Item 2 - Shaft
Item 3 - Seal Alignable Carrier (SAPO Seal)
Item 4 - Mounting Bolts
                                           Pacie 4 of 7

3.0     SAPO Seal Operation
During operation, the shaft (Item 2) may not maintain parallelism with the housing (Item 1)
and so the entire seal (Item 3) must be able to move with respect to the housing (vertically
and horizontally (in and out of the page)). Furthermore, the shaft is axially misaligning about
bearing centre line (vertical red line).
To maintain seal parallelism with respect to the shaft during this misalignment, the Alignable
Inner Seal Carrier (Figure 1, Item 2) must move within the Outer Seal Carrier (Figure 1, Item
1).
The Seal Alignable Carrier (SAPO Seal) must be sealed to the housing with a flexible seal.
This seal must allow for the relative movement between the housing and the Seal Alignable
Carrier (SAPO Seal) and resist contamination ingress.
To allow for this relative Seal Alignable Carrier (SAPO Seal) movement, the mounting holes
for the mounting bolts (Figure 2, Item 4) are machined oversized. These bolts will be
tightened (or spaced) to allow for adequate sealing force between the housing (Figure 2,
Item 1) and the Seal Alignable Carrier (SAPO Seal) (Figure 2, Item 3).
3.1     Operation - Sealing Medium
The oil seal (Figure 1, Item 3) cavity (Figure 2, circled red) will be filled with oil. The viscosity
grade will vary depending upon the application. Furthermore, this oil will then be pressurised
to a minimum 0.5 Bar (50 kPa) above atmospheric pressure. Any material attempting to
breach the seal will be forced out along with a small quantity of oil. This oil pressure will vary
depending on the application.

4.0     SAPO Seal Claim
Current sealing systems use grease as the sealing medium. This grease has a tendency to
become contaminated by surrounding dust and abrasive material eventually contaminating
the bearing lubricant within the housing.
Conventional oil seals require oil from the components being lubricated to lubricate the seal
lip face or shaft damage will result. The SAPO Seal utilises its own oil reservoir to maintain
pressure whilst lubricating seal lip faces. Depending on the application, this oil pressure
could also be sourced from the equipment using the oil.
Fundamentally, the concept is to utilise pressurised oil between the oil seals to maintain a
contamination barrier from the item requiring sealing on a rotating shaft. Some examples of
applications with rotating shafts that require seals for bearing lubricant cleanliness to be
maintained are:
     *  Conveyor Pulleys
     *   Electric motors
     *  Gearboxes
     *   Railway traction motors and axle boxes
     *   Pumps
     *  Crushers
     *  Screens
The SAPO Seal has the ability to maintain parallelism with the shaft where horizontal, axial
and radial misalignment are present.
Summary of SAPO Seal Claim:
     1. Misalignment in three (3) axes - vertical, horizontal and radial
     2. Parallelism with the shaft
     3. Pressurised oil as a sealing medium (pressure and viscosity will vary depending on
        application)
