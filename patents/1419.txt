Technical Field
[0001] This invention relates to a clamp assembly particularly but not exclusively
applicable for mounting agricultural or earth working tools to a tool bar.
Background Art
[0002] It is common in agricultural equipment to employ a tractor or other prime
mover drawn tool bar to which any suitable tools may be mounted directly or
indirectly depending upon the application required. The tool bar generally extends
transversely of the direction of movement of the prime mover and respective tools
such as tilling or ploughing tools are mounted either directly to the tool bar by
different forms of clamp assemblies or to an arm which is mounted by a clamp
assembly to a tool bar. Commonly the clamp assemblies comprise two parts which
locate on opposite sides of the tool bar and which are clamped together by bolts. In
other forms of clamp assembly a pair of clamp members is provided which are
hingedly interconnected at one end and adapted to be clamped to the tool bar by a
single bolt between the clamp members at their opposite ends. In yet a further
simplified form the clamp assemblies may simply comprise U-bolts.
[0003] In each of the above arrangements difficulties can be encountered in
positioning the clamp assembly at a required location along the tool bar, whilst at the
same time actuating the clamping members to hold the clamp assembly to the tool
bar. The clamping effect achieved in some circumstances such as where U-bolts are
used is also not often very effective or secure. A further difficulty encountered with
known clamp assemblies is that the load applied to the clamp assembly is often an
upward twisting load which tends to loosen the clamp assembly. Consequently
known clamp assemblies often are required to be heavily constructed to resist such
loadings. Where the clamp assembly includes a bolt or bolts which clamp the clamp
assembly to the tool bar, the bolt or bolts can fail due to the high loads which may be
encountered.        Furthermore access to the nuts for tightening the clamp assembly
YEO100300PDESCRIPTION20022107

                                               2
onto a tool bar is often limited and as a consequence the clamp assembly is not
often securely mounted to the tool bar.
Summary of the Invention
[0004] The present            invention aims to address one or more of the above
disadvantages of the known clamping assemblies or at least provide an alternative to
known clamping assemblies. The present invention also aims in a preferred aspect
to provide a clamp assembly which may be relatively easily mounted to a tool bar or
other member and which will resist loads applied by tools mounted directly or
indirectly to the tool bar particularly twisting loads or other loads tending to loosen
the clamp assembly.
[0005] The present invention thus provides in one preferred aspect, a clamp
assembly for mounting to a rectangular or square sectioned support member, said
clamp assembly having a main jaw part having first and second members adapted to
be juxtaposed with respective adjacent side faces of said support member and
clamping means adapted to be disposed on the side of said support member
opposite the said main jaw part and being engageable with said main jaw part, said
clamping means comprising an J-shaped member having first, second and third
arms, said first and second arms being adapted to be juxtaposed with further
adjacent side faces of said support member and means for connecting said first and
third arms to said jaw part whereby said support member may be captured between
said jaw part and said clamping means.
[0006] Preferably the connecting means comprises means for urging the first and
second arms of the J-shaped member relatively towards the jaw part to clampingly
secure the jaw part of the clamp assembly to the support member.
[0007] Preferably the jaw part includes slots or openings for receipt of opposite end
portions of the J-shaped member. Preferably slots or openings are provided in the
first and second members of the jaw part respectively. Preferably one slot or opening
is adapted to receive an end of the first arm of the J-shaped member and the other
slot or opening is adapted to receive an end of the third arm of the J-shaped
YEO100300PDESCRIPTION20022107

                                            3
member. Suitably the first member of the jaw part includes a through opening or
aperture for receipt of the end of the first arm of the J-shaped member and the
second member of the main body of jaw part includes a slot for receipt of the third
arm of the J-shaped member. The slot suitably is provided at a leading end of the
second member and extends inwardly therefrom in a direction substantially normal to
the axis of the third arm when the jaw part is clamped to the support member.
[0008] Preferably the first and second members of the jaw part have first and second
mutually perpendicular faces respectively adapted to mate with complementary first
and second faces of the support member. The first and second members of the jaw
part comprise first and second jaw members respectively defining the first and
second faces.
[0009] Preferably the connecting means comprise opposite free ends of the J
shaped clamping member which are threaded for engagement by nuts to enable the
J-shaped member or members to be urged towards the main body part. The J
shaped member suitably comprises a J-shaped rod. Preferably the threads are
provided adjacent the ends of the first and third arms.
[0010] Preferably the third arm of the J-shaped member or rod extends at an obtuse
angle from the second arm and lies in the same plane as the first and second arms.
Preferably also the third arm is located on the same side of the second arm as the
first arm such that the clamping means is in the described J-shaped configuration.
Most preferably the obtuse angle is 1352. Preferably the nut engageable with the
thread on the third arm of the J-shaped member is adapted to cooperate with stop
means provided on the second jaw member. Preferably the stop means presents
stop surfaces or edges which extend substantially at right angles to the third arm.
[0011] Preferably the second jaw member includes a pair of members or flanges
provided respectively on opposite sides of the slot and defining the stop means such
that when engaged with the J-shaped clamping member, the first arm thereof
extends between the pair of members or flanges and through the aperture or slot.
The stop surfaces of the stop means extend in a direction substantially normal to the
axis of the third arm when the jaw part is clamped to the support member.

[0012] In one preferred aspect, the support member comprises a tool bar and a
support arm for supporting an agricultural or earth working tool is secured to the first
jaw member of the main jaw part. Thus the present invention in this aspect provides
a clamp assembly for mounting a support arm carrying a earth working or agricultural
tool to a tool bar, said support arm extending substantially normal to said tool bar,
said clamp assembly including a main jaw part adapted to be located on one side of

J-shaped member having first, second and third arms, said first arm of said J-shaped
member being mountable to said jaw part and said third arm of said J-shaped
member being mountable to said jaw part such that said tool bar is captured
between said jaw part and said clamping means, and means for urging said J
shaped member towards said jaw part to clampingly secure said clamp assembly to
said tool bar.      Suitably the support arm is mounted or secured at one end to a jaw
member of the jaw part such that when the clamp assembly is clamped to the tool
bar, the support arm extends substantially normal to the tool bar. Preferably the jaw
member include a socket for receiving an end of the support arm.        Means may be
provided for securing the support arm in the socket such as pinning means
.Alternatively, the support arm may be bolted or welded to the socket,
[0013] The present invention in a further aspect provides an agricultural or earth
working tool, said tool having a tool shank, said tool shank being clampingly secured
indirectly or directly to a tool bar by means of a clamping assembly as described
above.

Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiment
[0019] Referring to the drawings and firstly to Figs. 1 and 2 there is illustrated a
clamp assembly 10 according an embodiment of the present invention in exploded
view adapted in this instance for mounting to a horizontal tool bar 11 of an
agricultural implement (see Figs. 3 to 5), the tool bar 11 being of a rectangular or
square cross section. The clamp assembly 10 includes a main body or jaw part 12
comprising a first jaw member 13 having an inner planar face 14 which is adapted to
be juxtaposed with a side normally upright face 15 of the tool bar 11 (see Fig. 3).
[0020] Extending from the member 13 at the upper end thereof is a second jaw
member 16 which extends substantially at right angles to the jaw member 13 and
which has on its underside a planar face 17.        The planar face 17 of the second
member 16 is adapted to be juxtaposed with a second upper face 18 of the tool bar
11 which normally lies in a substantially horizontal plane. Typically the jaw part 12 is
formed as a casting with the jaw members 13 and 16 formed integrally but the jaw
part 12 may be fabricated with the members 13 and 16 interconnected by welding.
[0021] The member 13 has an opening 19 through the face 14 which is of an
outwardly stepped configuration upwardly from its lower end where it is of part
circular configuration 20 to locate an end of a clamping bolt as described further
below. The member 13 also has opposite outwardly extending side flanges 21 and a
top flange 22 joining the side flanges 21. The flanges 21 have aligned apertures 23
YEO100300PDESCRIPTION20022107

                                            6
to accept a bolt or pin and the top flange 22 is provided with a central aperture 24
again to receive a bolt of pin. The flanges 21 and 22 define a mounting or socket for
various configurations of tool supporting arms such as the arm 25 shown in Fig. 3 in
dotted outline. The end of the arm 25 may be received in the socket by projecting
inwardly between the flanges 22 to be secured thereto by bolting through the
openings 23 and/or 24. Alternatively the arm 25 may be of a configuration to project
into and mate with the opening 19.       In another arrangement, the arm 25 may be
secured to the flanges 21 and 22 by welding. The arm 25 may be welded to the
flanges 21 and 22 to project outwardly normal to the tool bar 11 in the manner shown
in Fig. 3. The arm 25 may carry any form of earth working tool such as a coulter
wheel assembly as described further below.
[0022] The jaw member 16 includes a pair of opposite upstanding side flanges 26
which join and support transversely extending angled stop flanges 27 at the free end
of the member 16. The flanges 27 are spaced apart to define a slot 28 therebetween
which can receive an end of a clamp bolt as described further below. The rear faces
29 of the stop flanges 27 are of a planar configuration and define stops for
cooperation with a nut and washer of the clamp bolt as also described further below.
Typically the faces 29 are angled at 45 to the face 17 of the jaw member 13. The
slot 27 is of arcuate form at its lower end at 30 so that the clamp bolt may be
received neatly in position and nest within the arcuate slot end 30 in use.
[0023] The clamp assembly 10 additional includes a clamping bolt 31 for securing
the jaw part 12 to the tool bar 11. The clamping bolt 31 is of a somewhat J- shape in
configuration having a pair of arms 32 and 33 extending at right angles to each
other, the arm 32 being adapted to be juxtaposed in use with the bottom face 34 of
the tool bar 11 and the arm 33 being adapted to be juxtaposed with the side face 35
of the tool bar 11 opposite the face 14. The arm 32 is threaded at its free end 36
and the end 36 in use extends through the opening 19 nesting within the curved
lower end 20 thereof and is accessible from the outer side of the member 13 for
receipt of a washer 37 and engagement with a nut 38. Typically the clamping bolt 31
is formed of a rod material such as a steel rod.
YEO100300PDESCRIPTION20022107

                                           7
[0024] The other arm 33 of the bolt 31 joins an angled shorter end arm 39 which
extends at an obtuse angle from the arm 33 and lies in the same plane as the arm
32 so that the bolt 30 is of a J-shaped configuration. The arm 39 threaded at is free
end 40 and is freely receivable in the slot 28 and between the stop members or
flanges 27. The threaded end 40 of the arm 39 can receive a further washer 41 and
nut 42, at least the washer being of a diameter or of transverse dimensions sufficient
to span and seat on the surfaces 29 of the spaced apart flanges 27. It will also be
noted that the arm 39 is angled and such that its axis X-X is at right angles to the
stop surfaces 29 of the flanges 27 such that in use the washer 41 will sit flat on the
respective surface 29. Preferably the arm 39 extends at 1352 to the arm 33 when
the surfaces 29 are angled at 45 2 to the surface 17.         The arm 33 has a length
between the arm 23 and arm 39 which is substantially the same as the depth of the
tool bar 11, that is the distance between the surfaces 18 and 34, to ensure firm
clamping of the jaw member 12 to the tool bar 11.
[0025] In use and as shown in Figs. 3 to 5, the jaw part 10 of the clamp assembly 10
is applied to the tool bar 11 so that the members 13 and 16 are juxtaposed with the
mutually perpendicular faces 15 and 18 of the tool bar 11 with the inner faces of the
members 14 and 17 being in face-to-face contact with the faces 15 and 18 of the tool
bar 11.
[0026] The clamping bolt 31 is then positioned opposite the jaw member 12 such that
the arms 32 and 33 are located adjacent to the mutually perpendicular faces 34 and
35 of the tool bar 11 and so that the threaded ends 36 and 40 are received in and
project respectively through the opening 19 in the jaw member 13 and the slot 28 of
the jaw member 16. Washers and nuts 37 and 41, and 38 and 42 are then applied
to the threaded ends 36 and 40 of the bolt 31.     It will be appreciated that when the
nut 42 is tightened against the faces 29 of the flanges 27 via the washer 41, it will
apply a clamping force in two directions tending to lift the bolt 31 as indicated by the
arrows A in Fig. 4 upwardly and move it inwardly and upwardly against the tool bar
11 so that the faces 14 and 17 of the jaw part 12 are urged against the surfaces 15
and 18 of the tool bar 11. When the nut 38 is tightened, it will apply an inward
clamping force via the washer 37 in the direction B parallel to the arm 32 to urge the
YEO100300PDESCRIPTION20022107

                                                8
clamping bolt 31 against face 35 of the tool bar 11 and urge the jaw member 13
firmly against the face 15 of the tool bar 11.
[0027] To release the clamp assembly 10, the nuts 38 and 42 are loosened until the
clamping member 31 can be detached from the jaw part 12 which allows the jaw part
12 to be disengaged from the tool bar 11.         Alternatively, the nuts 38 and 42 may be
loosened sufficiently to enable the end 39 to be moved outwardly free of the flanges
27 which will allow the clamping member 31 to pivot about the axis of the arm 32 and
therefore allow the jaw part 12 to be moved free of the tool bar 11.
[0028] The clamping assembly 10 described above can be used for mounting an
arm to a transverse tool bar for agricultural applications as for example shown in Fig.
6 where arm 25 projects forwardly (or rearwardly) from the tool bar 11, the arm 25
being secured to the jaw member 13 of the jaw part 12 such as by welding to the
flanges 21 and 22 as shown in dotted outline Fig. 3. Alternatively, the arm 25 may
be received in the socket defined by the flanges 21 and 22 and secured by bolts or
other fasteners passed through the openings 23 and support arm 25. Any form of
earth working tool such as the coulter wheel assembly 43 shown in Fig. 6 may be
mounted to the arm 25 whilst the arm 25 is mounted by the clamp assembly 10 to
the tool bar 11. The clamping assembly, however, may be applied to other clamping
applications and to secure any other tool to a support member.
[0029] The configuration of the clamp assembly 10 may also be varied to suit the
application. The clamp assembly described above is shown in association with a tool
bar or member of square section form. The principles of the invention, however, of
course may be applied to clamping to members 11 of rectangular cross sectional
form by varying the size of the members 13 and 16 and configuration of the clamp
member 31.
[0030] Any loads on the clamp assembly 10 will tend to be loads which apply an anti
clockwise force to the clamp assembly 11 as indicated by the arrow C in Fig.6 due to
the tool of the implement such as the coulter wheel assembly 43 being located in the
ground or earth.          The majority of this force will be taken by the arms 32 of the
clamping bolt 31 acting against the under surface 44 of the tool bar 11 and tension

                                            9
applied to the arm 33 which is transferred to the flanges 27 via the arm 39.  Hence
the load taken by the jaw part 12 will be reduced in comparison to conventional
clamping arrangements.
[0031] Whilst the clamp assembly described above is shown with a single clamping
member 31, in another form, the clamping assembly may include more than one
clamping member 31.
[0032] The components of the clamp assembly of the invention are preferably
fabricated from steel, however, the main jaw part 12 of the clamp assembly 10 if
desired may be cast with all parts integrally formed.
[0033] Whilst the above has been given by way of illustrative embodiment of the
invention, all such modifications and variations thereto as would be apparent to
persons skilled in the art are deemed to fall within the broad scope and ambit of the
invention as defined in the appended claims.
