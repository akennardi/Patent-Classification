                                         ABSTRACT
  A storage tank is described. The storage tank includes a base and at least one side wall
  extending upwardly from the base. The base includes a raised inner portion and an
  outer peripheral foot portion, and wherein the foot portion, a lower portion of the side
5 wall and the raised inner portion in combination define a peripheral sump.

                                            Storage Tank
   Field of the invention
   [001] The invention relates to storage tanks, and in particular to storage tanks for
   receiving and storing liquids, including fluid waste in the form of sludge or slurry.
   Background of the invention
   [002] To date, storage tanks for receiving and storing fluid waste types - such as
   waste in the form of sludges or slurries, or liquid waste that contains suspended solids
   are usually formed with a downward tapered base defining a central sump. Such a base
   enables the waste to be collected from the sump, which is the location where residual
   waste will concentrate due to the effects of gravity.
   [003] There are a number of limitations and trade-offs involved in traditional storage
   tanks. One trade-off is that the outward tapered base requires the tank to be elevated
   and supported by a stabilising stand or frame, and thus the stability of the tank is
   dependent on such a stand or frame and its stability and strength. Another is that the
   tapered base significantly increases the height of the tank without also significantly
   increasing its volume. The overall space occupied by the arrangement, including the
   stand, is significantly increased and includes dead space not devoted to storage.
   [004] Reference to any prior art in the specification is not an acknowledgment or
   suggestion that this prior art forms part of the common general knowledge in any
   jurisdiction or that this prior art could reasonably be expected to be understood,
   regarded as relevant, and/or combined with other pieces of prior art by a skilled person
   in the art.
   Summary of the invention
   [005] The present invention provides a storage tank including: a base and at least one
   side wall extending upwardly from the base, the base including a raised inner portion
   and an outer peripheral foot portion, and wherein the foot portion, a lower portion of the
   side wall and the raised inner portion in combination define a peripheral sump; and at
   least one waste outlet in communication with the sump for permitting the drainage of
   waste accumulated in the sump.

   waste outlet.
   [012] The storage tank can further include a purge pipe having at least one outlet
   positioned in the sump, the purge inlet being defined by the at least one outlet of the
   purge pipe.
   [013] The purge pipe can terminate in a T-junction located in the sump, and the at least
   one outlet of the purge pipe includes two oppositely facing outlet openings formed in the
   T-junction and directed along the lower portion of the side wall.
   [014] The purge pipe can pass through the side wall and communicates with a source
   of purging liquid.
   [015] The raised inner portion can include at least one radially extending rib.
   [016] The raised inner portion can have one of a conical, frustoconical or dome shape.
   [017] The raised inner portion can be formed integrally with the foot portion.
   [018] The base can be formed integrally with the side wall.
   [019] The storage tank can further include a top cover formed integrally with the upper
   end of the side wall.

   Detailed description of the embodiments
   [036] A first embodiment of a storage tank 1 is depicted within Figures 1A-7 and
   includes a base 2, a cylindrical side wall 3 extending upwardly from the base 2, and a
   top cover 5 formed at an upper end of the side wall 3. The side wall 3 has a
   substantially circular cross section, and includes two circumferential reinforcing ribs 7A,
   7B recessed into the interior of the tank 1 and extending substantially around the
   circumference of the tank 1 in positions spaced apart in the axial direction of the tank 1.
   The top cover 5 is formed as a slightly dome shaped or convex disc with a
   circumference that corresponds to the upper end of the side wall 3, and is provided with
   an inspection opening 9 offset from the central axis of the tank 1. The top cover 5
   further includes four dome shaped protuberances 11, each of which may accommodate
   a waste inlet or measuring device (e.g. an ultrasonic or other type of measuring device).
   [037] The side wall 3 has two vertical recesses 13A, 13B, each vertical recess 13A,
   13B extending the entire height of the side wall 3, i.e. from a lower end to an upper end
   of the side wall 3. As depicted in Figure 2, the vertical recesses 13A, 13B are located at
   diametrically opposed positions in the side wall 3, and their upper ends are connected
   by a horizontal recess 15 formed in the top cover 5. Together, the vertical recesses
   13A, 13B and the horizontal recess 15 provide a receiving portion in which an optional
   frame (not shown) may be received to fix the tank 1 in situ. In order to allow easier
   access to the base of such a frame, the bottom end of the vertical recesses 13A, 13B
   are flared outwards as shown in Figures 1A and 1B.
   [038] The storage tank 1 is provided with a suction pipe 17 that passes through the
   side wall 3 at a location proximate the upper end of said side wall 3. As shown in
   Figures 1A and 2, the side wall 3 is formed with a recessed portion 19 at the location at
   which the suction pipe 17 passes through, this recessed portion 19 being formed with a
   flat surface 19. An external section 17A of the suction pipe 17 extends vertically down
   the exterior of the side wall 3 from said recessed portion 19, and is fixed to an exterior
   of the side wall 3 with bracket 21. This external section 17A terminated in a lower open
   end that may be in communication with a suction pump (not shown).
                                                     4
P5405AU02

   [039] The storage tank 1 is further provided with a purge pipe 23 that passes through
   the side wall 3 at a location proximate the upper end of said side wall 3. The side wall 3
   is formed with a recessed portion 25 at the location at which the purge pipe 23 passes
   through, this recessed portion 25 being formed with a flat surface. As can be taken from
   Figure 2, the recessed portion 25 through which the purge pipe 23 passes is formed at
   a location diametrically opposite the location at which the recessed portion 19 is formed.
   An external section 23A of the purge pipe 23 extends vertically down the exterior of the
   side wall 3 from said recessed portion 25, and terminates in an open end which may be
   connected to a source of flushing or purging liquid, such as a water pump.
   [040] As shown in Figures 4 and 5, the base 2 includes a central raised portion 27
   protruding into the tank 1 and a flat, outer peripheral foot portion 29 extending
   circumferentially around the central raised portion 27. Together with a lower portion of
   the side wall 3, said central raised portion 27 and foot portion 29 define a sump 31 for
   collecting residual waste.
   [041] In the present embodiment the central raised portion 27 is formed integrally with
   the foot portion 29 and has a substantially conical shape. It will be appreciated that, in
   alternative embodiments, the central raised portion 27 may initially be formed separately
   from and subsequently sealed to the foot portion 29.
   [042] In this embodiment of the tank 1, the foot portion 29 is flat and coplanar and
   extends completely around the outer circumference of the central raised portion 27. In
   other words, the foot portion 29 has the form of an annulus between the lower end of
   the side wall 3 and the outer circumference of the central raised portion 27. The flat and
   coplanar nature of the foot portion 29 allows the tank 1 to be stably supported by the
   foot portion 29 when it is placed on even ground. It will be appreciated that, in
   alternative embodiments, the foot portion 29 may be formed such that it does not extend
   completely around the outer circumference of the central raised portion 27, and/or may
   be formed with a stepped configuration
   [043] In certain embodiments the external and internal shapes of the foot portion are
   the same: i.e. the internal shape of the foot portion is flat and the external shape of the
   foot portion is flat. In other embodiments the internal and external shape of the foot
   portion 29 may differ. For example, a stepped or sloped foot portion 29 may be provided
   to assist in feeding fluid towards a tank discharge point (e.g. an inlet opening 37 of the
                                                     5
P5405AU02

   suction pipe 17). In such embodiments, the step/slope shape of the foot portion 29 may
   be internal to the tank only (i.e. the internal shape of the foot portion) and the external
   shape of the foot portion 29 may be shaped (e.g. flat) to provide a stable surface for the
   tank 1 to sit on.
   [044] As shown in Figures 4 and 5, the central raised portion 27 is provided with a
   number of radially extending reinforcing ribs 33 recessed into the surface of the conical
   shape. In this embodiment of the tank 1, the central raised portion 27 is provided with
   three reinforcing ribs 33. Figure 12 shows an alternative embodiment of the base which
   is formed with four reinforcing ribs 33. It will be appreciated that alternative
   embodiments may include more or fewer reinforcing ribs 33, or may even omit such
   reinforcing ribs 33. Alternatively, added reinforcement may be provided in the form, for
   example, of a cruciform array of ribs extending across the raised portion and forming
   part of the base.
   [045] As depicted in Figure 5, an internal section 17B of the suction pipe 17 extends
   downwardly along, and spaced apart from, the interior of the side wall 3. This internal
   section 17B of the suction pipe 17 is fixed to the interior of the side wall 3 with a bracket
   and terminates in a T-junction 35 located in the sump 31 of the tank 1. The long portion
   of the T-junction 35 is connected to the internal section 17B of the suction pipe 17 at a
   slight angle from the vertical, and the short portion of the T-junction 35 has two inlet
   openings 37 that face in opposite, circumferential directions along the lower portion of
   the side wall 3.
   [046] As depicted in Figures 4 and 5, an internal section 23B of the purge pipe 23
   extends downwardly along, and spaced apart from, the interior of the side wall 3. This
   internal section 23B of the purge pipe 23 terminates in a T-junction 39 located in a sump
   31 of the tank 1. Although not shown, the T-junction 39 of the internal section 23B of the
   purge pipe 23 has two outlet openings that face in opposite, circumferential directions
   along the lower portion of the side wall 3 to allow the entry of purging of flushing liquid
   that can agitate slurry accumulated in the sump and direct it towards the suction inlet.
   [047] As shown in Figure 5, the diameter of the suction pipe 17 is significantly larger
   than the diameter of the purge pipe 23. The diameter of the suction pipe is selected to
   allow the extraction from the tank of waste having various forms, such as sludge, slurry
   or liquid waste that contain solids.
                                                      6
P5405AU02

   [048] It will be appreciated that whilst this embodiment of the storage tank 1 includes
   both a suction pipe 17 and a purge pipe 23, alternative embodiments may omit the
   purge pipe 23 completely, and/or may omit the suction pipe 17. In an alternative
   embodiment, the tank 1 may be provided with at least one outlet in communication with
   the sump 31 for permitting the draining of waste accumulated in the sump. Such an
   outlet may take the form of the above described suction pipe 17, or may merely be
   gravity fed from the sump 31. In a still further embodiment, a waste outlet through which
   waste can be discharged/collected may be provided anywhere on the tank 1. For
   example, in the depicted tank 1 opening 9 could be used as a waste outlet by inserting
   a suction pipe/hose therethrough so an end of the suction pipe/hose can collect waste
   from the sump 31. Such a suction pipe/hose may be provided with tank 1, or be entirely
   separate thereto (and carried, for example, by a waste collection vehicle).
   [049] The base 2, cylindrical side wall 3 and top cover 5 of the tank 1 are integrally
   formed from high-density polyethylene (HDPE) using a roto-moulding manufacturing
   process. It will be appreciated that the tank 1 may manufactured from any other suitable
   material, such as aluminium, stainless steel, galvanised steel or fibreglass, using an
   appropriate manufacturing process. The base 2, cylindrical side wall 3 and top cover 5
   may alternatively be formed separately from each other.
   [050] In a particular aspect of this embodiment of the tank 1, the side wall 3 may have
   a diameter of 1620 mm and a height 2470 mm, and the conical central raised portion 27
   may have a height of 650 mm. With the surface of the cone set at about 450 to the
   horizontal, such dimensions result in a tank having a capacity of 4000 litres.
   [051] Alternative embodiments with different dimensions and capacities are, of course,
   possible. Furthermore, the surface of the cone may be formed at alternative angles to
   450. For example, angles of between 100 and 700 may be appropriate in certain cases.
   [052] An alternative embodiment of a storage tank 101 will now be described with
   reference to Figures 8 to 11. It will be appreciated that many of the features of the
   storage tank 101 are similar, if not identical, to corresponding features of storage tank 1.
   Accordingly, these features will be identified by the same reference numerals prefixed
   with "1"or "10". Moreover, the following description will be restricted to those areas of
   the storage tank 101 that substantially differ from the storage tank 101.
                                                      7
P5405AU02

   [053] As was the case for the storage tank 1, the storage tank 101 includes a base
   102, a cylindrical side wall 103 extending upwardly from the base 102, and a top cover
   105 formed at an upper end of the side wall 103. The side wall 103 has a substantially
   circular cross section, and includes three circumferential reinforcing ribs 107A, 107B,
   107C recessed into the tank 101 and extending substantially around the circumference
   of the tank 101 in positions spaced apart in the axial direction of the tank 101.
   [054] The side wall 103 has two vertical recesses connected at their upper ends by a
   horizontal recess formed in the top cover 105. A vertical tie-bar 141 is received in each
   of the two vertical recesses and a horizontal tie-down or cross bar 143 is received in the
   horizontal recess. Together, the two vertical tie-bars 141 and the horizontal tie-down bar
   143 provide a U-shaped tie-bar or staple arrangement to fix the tank 101 in situ and to
   stabilise it.
   [055] The upper end of each vertical tie-bar 141 may be provided with a bolt or
   threaded rod that can be inserted through a corresponding aperture provided in the
   horizontal tie-down bar 143 so as to protrude through the horizontal tie-down bar 143. A
   nut can be screwed onto the bolt or threaded rod so as to fix the horizontal tie-down bar
   143 to the upper end of the respective vertical tie-bar 141. The nuts at each end of the
   horizontal tie-down bar 143 may be screwed onto the respective bolt or threaded rod to
   differing heights, which allows the U-shaped tie-bar or staple arrangement to
   compensate for minor variations in the supporting surface. The lower end of each
   vertical tie-bar 141 may be provided with a flange plate with apertures through which
   securing bolts can be inserted to secure the vertical tie-bar 141 to the supporting
   surface.
   [056] In the depicted embodiment, the two vertical recesses are located at
   diametrically opposed positions in the side wall 103. It will be appreciated that, in an
   alternative embodiment, the two vertical recesses may be offset and/or further recesses
   may be provided to receive additional U-shaped tie-bar arrangements or frames. In
   addition, the two vertical tie-bars 141 and the horizontal tie-down bar 143 are formed
   from rectangular hollow section (RHS) steel. It will also be appreciated that, in an
   alternative embodiment, the tie-bar arrangements or frames may be formed from any
   other suitable material apart from RHS steel.
                                                    8
P5405AU02

   [057] Similar to the storage tank 1, the storage tank 103 is provided with a suction pipe
   117 that passes through the side wall 3 at a location proximate the upper end of said
   side wall 103. In contrast, a purge pipe has been omitted from this embodiment.
   [058] The storage tank 103 further includes a ladder arrangement 145 extending the
   height of the side wall 103 and connected to the horizontal tie-down bar 143 across the
   top cover 105 of the tank 101. The ladder arrangement 145 includes a ladder portion
   comprising a plurality of rungs 147 and terminating at its upper end in a landing 149 to
   allow access to an inspection opening 109 formed in the top cover 105. The ladder
   arrangement 145 further includes a frame portion that extends up from the landing 149
   and across the top cover 105 to be connected with the horizontal tie-down bar 143.
   [059] In the embodiments illustrated above the raised portion 27 of the tank 1 has a
   dome/conical shape. The raised portion may, however, have alternative shapes.
   Figures 13 to 18 provide sectional depictions of various shapes a raised portion 27 of a
   tank could take. In Fig. 13 the raised portion 27 is a dome shape. In Fig. 14 the raised
   portion 27 is an elevated dome shape - i.e. a dome shape sitting atop a
   cylinder/vertically extending wall. In Fig. 15 the raised portion 27 is a pointed cone (or
   pyramid) shape. In Fig. 16 the raised portion 27 is an elevated pointed cone. In Figs 17
   and 18 the raised portion 27 is an asymmetric dome/cone/pyramid (i.e. the apex of the
   dome/cone/pyramid is off-centre).
   [060] Furthermore, the term 'central' with respect to the raised portion is not intended
   to be construed as referring to a strict centre-line of the tank. For example, Figures 19
   and 20 each provide a sectional depiction of a tank 1 with a raised portion 27 that is
   offset from the centre of the tank 1. The raised portions 27 in these figures are internally
   raised portions.
   [061] The shapes of the raised portions 27 as depicted in Figures 13 to 20 are
   provided by way of non-limiting example only. Further variations are possible within the
   general concept of a raised internal portion that, together with a base of the tank and a
   lower portion of the side wall of the tank, define a peripheral sump.
   [062] The embodiments described herein may provide various advantages over
   traditional tanks with downwardly tapered bases. For example, the embodiments can be
   stably positioned without the need for an external frame or other support (though such a
                                                      9
P5405AU02

   frame can be provided if desired, for example to secure the tank in place). Avoiding the
   need for a support structure can significantly reduce the cost and work involved in
   installing a tank.
   [063] Another (or alternative) advantage that may be offered by certain embodiments
   described herein is improved waste discharge/collection, particularly where the tank is
   used for thick slurries/sludges. In traditional tanks with downwardly tapered bases, the
   slurry/sludge may form a plug in the tapered portion of the tank. In this case the sludge
   will not flow through an outlet under the force of gravity, and applying suction will often
   only exacerbate the problem by compacting the plug of waste and making it even more
   difficult to remove. This problem is avoided by embodiments described herein.
