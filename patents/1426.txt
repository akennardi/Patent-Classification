                                       BACKGROUND
                                        Technical Field
         The present invention relates to the field of therapeutic agent delivery using lipid
particles. In particular, the present invention provides cationic lipids and lipid particles
comprising these lipids, which are advantageous for the in vivo delivery of nucleic acids,
as well as nucleic acid-lipid particle compositions suitable for in vivo therapeutic use.
Additionally, the present invention provides methods of making these compositions, as
well as methods of introducing nucleic acids into cells using these compositions, e.g., for
the treatment of various disease conditions.
                               Description of the Related Art
         Therapeutic nucleic acids include, e.g., small interfering RNA (siRNA), micro
RNA (miRNA), antisense oligonucleotides, ribozymes, plasmids, immune stimulating
nucleic acids, antisense, antagomir, antimir, microRNA mimic, supermir, Ul adaptor,
and aptamer. These nucleic acids act via a variety of mechanisms. In the case of siRNA
or miRNA, these nucleic acids can down-regulate intracellular levels of specific proteins
                                                1

 WO 2010/054406                                                              PCT/US2009/063933
through a process termed RNA interference (RNAi). Following introduction of siRNA or
miRNA into the cell cytoplasm, these double-stranded RNA constructs can bind to a
protein termed RISC. The sense strand of the siRNA or miRNA is displaced from the
RISC complex providing a template within RISC that can recognize and bind mRNA
with a complementary sequence to that of the bound siRNA or miRNA. Having bound
the complementary mRNA the RISC complex cleaves the mRNA and releases the
cleaved strands. RNAi can provide down-regulation of specific proteins by targeting
specific destruction of the corresponding mRNA that encodes for protein synthesis.
        The therapeutic applications of RNAi are extremely broad, since siRNA and
miRNA constructs can be synthesized with any nucleotide sequence directed against a
target protein. To date, siRNA constructs have shown the ability to specifically down
regulate target proteins in both in vitro and in vivo models. In addition, siRNA constructs
are currently being evaluated in clinical studies.
        However, two problems currently faced by siRNA or miRNA constructs are, first,
their susceptibility to nuclease digestion in plasma and, second, their limited ability to
gain access to the intracellular compartment where they can bind RISC when
administered systemically as the free siRNA or miRNA. These double-stranded
constructs can be stabilized by incorporation of chemically modified nucleotide linkers
within the molecule, for example, phosphothioate groups. However, these chemical
modifications provide only limited protection from nuclease digestion and may decrease
the activity of the construct. Intracellular delivery of siRNA or miRNA can be facilitated
by use of carrier systems such as polymers, cationic liposomes or by chemical
modification of the construct, for example by the covalent attachment of cholesterol
molecules. However, improved delivery systems are required to increase the potency of
siRNA and miRNA molecules and reduce or eliminate the requirement for chemical
modification.
        Antisense oligonucleotides and ribozymes can also inhibit mRNA translation into
protein. In the case of antisense constructs, these single stranded deoxynucleic acids have
a complementary sequence to that of the target protein mRNA and can bind to the mRNA
by Watson-Crick base pairing. This binding either prevents translation of the target
mRNA and/or triggers RNase H degradation of the mRNA transcripts. Consequently,
                                                2

  WO 2010/054406                                                            PCT/US2009/063933
antisense oligonucleotides have tremendous potential for specificity of action (i.e.,
down-regulation of a specific disease-related protein). To date, these compounds have
shown promise in several in vitro and in vivo models, including models of inflammatory
disease, cancer, and HIV (reviewed in Agrawal, Trends in Biotech. 14:376-387 (1996)).
Antisense can also affect cellular activity by hybridizing specifically with chromosomal
DNA. Advanced human clinical assessments of several antisense drugs are currently
underway. Targets for these drugs include the bcl2 and apolipoprotein B genes and
mRNA products.
          Immune-stimulating nucleic acids include deoxyribonucleic acids and ribonucleic
acids. In the case of deoxyribonucleic acids, certain sequences or motifs have been shown
to illicit immune stimulation in mammals. These sequences or motifs include the CpG
motif, pyrimidine-rich sequences and palindromic sequences. It is believed that the CpG
motif in deoxyribonucleic acids is specifically recognized by an endosomal receptor, toll
like receptor 9 (TLR-9), which then triggers both the innate and acquired immune
stimulation pathway. Certain immune stimulating ribonucleic acid sequences have also
been reported. It is believed that these RNA sequences trigger immune activation by
binding to toll-like receptors 6 and 7 (TLR-6 and TLR-7). In addition, double-stranded
RNA is also reported to be immune stimulating and is believe to activate via binding to
TLR-3.
          One well known problem with the use of therapeutic nucleic acids relates to the
stability of the phosphodiester internucleotide linkage and the susceptibility of this linker
to nucleases. The presence of exonucleases and endonucleases in serum results in the
rapid digestion of nucleic acids possessing phosphodiester linkers and, hence, therapeutic
nucleic acids can have very short half-lives in the presence of serum or within cells.
(Zelphati, 0., et al., Antisense. Res. Dev. 3:323-338 (1993); and Thierry, A.R., et al.,
pp147-161 in Gene Regulation: Biology of Antisense RNA and DNA (Eds. Erickson, RP
and Izant, JG; Raven Press, NY (1992)). Therapeutic nucleic acid being currently being
developed do not employ the basic phosphodiester chemistry found in natural nucleic
acids, because of these and other known problems.
          This problem has been partially overcome by chemical modifications that reduce
serum or intracellular degradation. Modifications have been tested at the internucleotide
                                               3

  WO 2010/054406                                                             PCT/US2009/063933
phosphodiester bridge (e.g., using phosphorothioate, methylphosphonate or
phosphoramidate linkages), at the nucleotide base (e.g., 5-propynyl-pyrimidines), or at
the sugar (e.g., 2'-modified sugars) (Uhlmann E., et al. Antisense: Chemical
Modifications. Encyclopedia of Cancer, Vol. X., pp 64-81 Academic Press Inc. (1997)).
Others have attempted to improve stability using 2'-5' sugar linkages (see, e.g., U.S. Pat.
No. 5,532,130). Other changes have been attempted. However, none of these solutions
have proven entirely satisfactory, and in vivo free therapeutic nucleic acids still have only
limited efficacy.
         In addition, as noted above relating to siRNA and miRNA, problems remain with
the limited ability of therapeutic nucleic acids to cross cellular membranes (see, Vlassov,
et al., Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1197:95-1082 (1994)) and in the problems associated with
systemic toxicity, such as complement-mediated anaphylaxis, altered coagulatory
properties, and cytopenia (Galbraith, et al., Antisense Nucl. Acid DrugDes. 4:201-206
(1994)).
         To attempt to improve efficacy, investigators have also employed lipid-based
carrier systems to deliver chemically modified or unmodified therapeutic nucleic acids.
In Zelphati, 0 and Szoka, F.C., J. Contr.Rel. 41:99-119 (1996), the authors refer to the
use of anionic (conventional) liposomes, pH sensitive liposomes, immunoliposomes,
fusogenic liposomes, and cationic lipid/antisense aggregates. Similarly siRNA has been
administered systemically in cationic liposomes, and these nucleic acid-lipid particles
have been reported to provide improved down-regulation of target proteins in mammals
including non-human primates (Zimmermann et al., Nature 441: 111-114 (2006)).
         In spite of this progress, there remains a need in the art for improved lipid
therapeutic nucleic acid compositions that are suitable for general therapeutic use.
Preferably, these compositions would encapsulate nucleic acids with high-efficiency,
have high drug:lipid ratios, protect the encapsulated nucleic acid from degradation and
clearance in serum, be suitable for systemic delivery, and provide intracellular delivery of
the encapsulated nucleic acid. In addition, these lipid-nucleic acid particles should be
well-tolerated and provide an adequate therapeutic index, such that patient treatment at an
effective dose of the nucleic acid is not associated with significant toxicity and/or risk to
the patient. The present invention provides such compositions, methods of making the

compositions, and methods of using the compositions to introduce nucleic acids into
cells, including for the treatment of diseases.

                                DETAILED DESCRIPTION
         The present invention is based, in part, upon the discovery of cationic lipids that
provide advantages when used in lipid particles for the in vivo delivery of a therapeutic
agent. In particular, as illustrated by the accompanying Examples, the present invention
provides nucleic acid-lipid particle compositions comprising a cationic lipid according to
the present invention. In some embodiments, a composition described herein provides
increased activity of the nucleic acid and/or improved tolerability of the compositions in
vivo, which can result in a significant increase in therapeutic index as compared to lipid
nucleic acid particle compositions previously described. Additionally compositions and
methods of use are disclosed that can provide for amelioration of the toxicity observed
with certain therapeutic nucleic acid-lipid particles.
         In certain embodiments, the present invention specifically provides for improved
compositions for the delivery of siRNA molecules. It is shown herein that these
compositions are effective in down-regulating the protein levels and/or mRNA levels of
target proteins. Furthermore, it is shown that the activity of these improved compositions

is dependent on the presence of a certain cationic lipids and that the molar ratio of
cationic lipid in the formulation can influence activity.
        The lipid particles and compositions of the present invention may be used for a
variety of purposes, including the delivery of associated or encapsulated therapeutic
agents to cells, both in vitro and in vivo. Accordingly, the present invention provides
methods of treating diseases or disorders in a subject in need thereof, by contacting the
subject with a lipid particle of the present invention associated with a suitable therapeutic
agent.
        As described herein, the lipid particles of the present invention are particularly
useful for the delivery of nucleic acids, including, e.g., siRNA molecules and plasmids.
Therefore, the lipid particles and compositions of the present invention may be used to
modulate the expression of target genes and proteins both in vitro and in vivo by
contacting cells with a lipid particle of the present invention associated with a nucleic
acid that reduces target gene expression (e.g., an siRNA) or a nucleic acid that may be
used to increase expression of a desired protein (e.g., a plasmid encoding the desired
protein).
        Various exemplary embodiments of the cationic lipids of the present invention, as
well as lipid particles and compositions comprising the same, and their use to deliver
therapeutic agents and modulate gene and protein expression are described in further
detail below.

         In one embodiment, the lipid is a racemic mixture.
         In one embodiment, the lipid is enriched in one diastereomer, e.g. the lipid has at
least 95%, at least 90%, at least 80% or at least 70% diastereomeric excess.
         In one embodiment, the lipid is enriched in one enantiomer, e.g. the lipid has at
least 95%, at least 90%, at least 80% or at least 70% enantiomer excess.
         In one embodiment, the lipid is chirally pure, e.g. is a single optical isomer.
         In one embodiment, the lipid is enriched for one optical isomer.
         Where a double bond is present (e.g., a carbon-carbon double bond or carbon
nitrogen double bond), there can be isomerism in the configuration about the double bond
(i.e. cis/trans or E/Z isomerism). Where the configuration of a double bond is illustrated
in a chemical structure, it is understood that the corresponding isomer can also be present.
The amount of isomer present can vary, depending on the relative stabilities of the
isomers and the energy required to convert between the isomers. Accordingly, some
double bonds are, for practical purposes, present in only a single configuration, whereas
others (e.g., where the relative stabilities are similar and the energy of conversion low)
may be present as inseparable equilibrium mixture of configurations.

            Although not all diasteromers for a lipid are shown, one aspect of the present invention is to provide all diastereomers and
as such chirally pure and diastereomerically enriched lipids are also part of this invention.
            In particular embodiments, the lipids of the present invention are cationic lipids.
As used herein, the term "cationic lipid" is meant to include those lipids having one or
two fatty acid or fatty alkyl chains and an amino head group (including an alkylamino or
dialkylamino group) that may be protonated to form a cationic lipid at physiological pH.
In some embodiments, a cationic lipid is referred to as an "amino lipid."
            Other cationic lipids would include those having alternative fatty acid groups and
other dialkylamino groups, including those in which the alkyl substituents are different
(e.g., N-ethyl-N-methylamino-, N-propyl-N-ethylamino- and the like). For those
embodiments in which R1 and R 2 are both long chain alkyl or acyl groups, they can be the
same or different. In general, lipids (e.g., a cationic lipid) having less saturated acyl
chains are more easily sized, particularly when the complexes are sized below about 0.3
microns, for purposes of filter sterilization. Cationic lipids containing unsaturated fatty
acids with carbon chain lengths in the range of ClO to C 20 are typical. Other scaffolds can
also be used to separate the amino group (e.g., the amino group of the cationic lipid) and
the fatty acid or fatty alkyl portion of the cationic lipid. Suitable scaffolds are known to
those of skill in the art.
                                                                   51

 WO 2010/054406                                                               PCT/US2009/063933
        In certain embodiments, cationic lipids of the present invention have at least one
protonatable or deprotonatable group, such that the lipid is positively charged at a pH at
or below physiological pH (e.g. pH 7.4), and neutral at a second pH, preferably at or
above physiological pH. Such lipids are also referred to as cationic lipids. It will, of
course, be understood that the addition or removal of protons as a function of pH is an
equilibrium process, and that the reference to a charged or a neutral lipid refers to the
nature of the predominant species and does not require that all of the lipid be present in
the charged or neutral form. Lipids that have more than one protonatable or
deprotonatable group, or which are zwiterrionic, are not excluded from use in the
invention.
        In certain embodiments, protonatable lipids (i.e., cationic lipids) according to the
invention have a pKa of the protonatable group in the range of about 4 to about 11.
Typically, lipids will have a pKa of about 4 to about 7, e.g., between about 5 and 7, such
as between about 5.5 and 6.8, when incorporated into lipid particles. Such lipids will be
cationic at a lower pH formulation stage, while particles will be largely (though not
completely) surface neutralized at physiological pH around pH 7.4. One of the benefits
of a pKa in the range of between about 4 and 7 is that at least some nucleic acid
associated with the outside surface of the particle will lose its electrostatic interaction at
physiological pH and be removed by simple dialysis; thus greatly reducing the particle's
susceptibility to clearance. pKa measurements of lipids within lipid particles can be
performed, for example, by using the fluorescent probe 2-(p-toluidino)-6-napthalene
sulfonic acid (TNS), using methods described in Cullis et al., (1986) Chem Phys Lipids
40, 127-144.
        In one embodiment, the formulations of the invention are entrapped by at least
75%, at least 80% or at least 90%.
        In one embodiment, the formulations of the invention further comprise an
apolipoprotein. As used herein, the term "apolipoprotein" or "lipoprotein" refers to
apolipoproteins known to those of skill in the art and variants and fragments thereof and
to apolipoprotein agonists, analogues or fragments thereof described below.
Suitable apolipoproteins include, but are not limited to, ApoA-I, ApoA-II, ApoA-IV,
ApoA-V and ApoE, and active polymorphic forms, isoforms, variants and mutants as
                                             52

  WO 2010/054406                                                             PCT/US2009/063933
well as fragments or truncated forms thereof. In certain embodiments, the apolipoprotein
is a thiol containing apolipoprotein. "Thiol containing apolipoprotein" refers to an
apolipoprotein, variant, fragment or isoform that contains at least one cysteine residue.
The most common thiol containing apolipoproteins are ApoA-I Milano (ApoA-Im) and
ApoA-I Paris (ApoA-Ip) which contain one cysteine residue (Jia et al., 2002, Biochem.
Biophys. Res. Comm. 297: 206-13; Bielicki and Oda, 2002, Biochemistry 41: 2089-96).
ApoA-II, ApoE2 and ApoE3 are also thiol containing apolipoproteins. Isolated ApoE
and/or active fragments and polypeptide analogues thereof, including recombinantly
produced forms thereof, are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,672,685; 5,525,472; 5,473,039;
5,182,364; 5,177,189; 5,168,045; 5,116,739; the disclosures of which are herein
incorporated by reference. ApoE3 is disclosed in Weisgraber, et al., "Human E
apoprotein heterogeneity: cysteine-arginine interchanges in the amino acid sequence of
the apo-E isoforms," J. Biol. Chem. (1981) 256: 9077-9083; and Rall, et al., "Structural
basis for receptor binding heterogeneity of apolipoprotein E from type III
hyperlipoproteinemic subjects," Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. (1982) 79: 4696-4700. See also
GenBank accession number K00396.
         In certain embodiments, the apolipoprotein can be in its mature form, in its
preproapolipoprotein form or in its proapolipoprotein form. Homo- and heterodimers
(where feasible) of pro- and mature ApoA-I (Duverger et al., 1996, Arterioscler. Thromb.
Vasc. Biol. 16(12):1424-29), ApoA-I Milano (Klon et al., 2000, Biophys. J. 79:(3)1679
87; Franceschini et al., 1985, J. Biol. Chem. 260: 1632-35), ApoA-I Paris (Daum et al.,
1999, J. Mol. Med. 77:614-22), ApoA-II (Shelness et al., 1985, J. Biol. Chem.
260(14):8637-46; Shelness et al., 1984, J. Biol. Chem. 259(15):9929-35), ApoA-IV
(Duverger et al., 1991, Euro. J. Biochem. 201(2):373-83), and ApoE (McLean et al., 1983,
J. Biol. Chem. 258(14):8993-9000) can also be utilized within the scope of the invention.
         In certain embodiments, the apolipoprotein can be a fragment, variant or isoform
of the apolipoprotein. The term "fragment" refers to any apolipoprotein having an amino
acid sequence shorter than that of a native apolipoprotein and which fragment retains the
activity of native apolipoprotein, including lipid binding properties. By "variant" is meant

abolish the activity of native apolipoprotein, including lipid binding properties. Thus, a
variant can comprise a protein or peptide having a substantially identical amino acid
sequence to a native apolipoprotein provided herein in which one or more amino acid
residues have been conservatively substituted with chemically similar amino acids.
Examples of conservative substitutions include the substitution of at least one
hydrophobic residue such as isoleucine, valine, leucine or methionine for another.
Likewise, the present invention contemplates, for example, the substitution of at least one
hydrophilic residue such as, for example, between arginine and lysine, between glutamine
and asparagine, and between glycine and serine (see U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,004,925, 6,037,323
and 6,046,166). The term "isoform" refers to a protein having the same, greater or partial
function and similar, identical or partial sequence, and may or may not be the product of
the same gene and usually tissue specific (see Weisgraber 1990, J. Lipid Res. 31(8):1503

         In certain embodiments, the methods and compositions of the present invention
include the use of a chimeric construction of an apolipoprotein. For example, a chimeric
construction of an apolipoprotein can be comprised of an apolipoprotein domain with
high lipid binding capacity associated with an apolipoprotein domain containing ischemia
reperfusion protective properties. A chimeric construction of an apolipoprotein can be a
construction that includes separate regions within an apolipoprotein (i.e., homologous
construction) or a chimeric construction can be a construction that includes separate
regions between different apolipoproteins (i.e., heterologous constructions).

Compositions comprising a chimeric construction can also include segments that are
apolipoprotein variants or segments designed to have a specific character (e.g., lipid
binding, receptor binding, enzymatic, enzyme activating, antioxidant or reduction
oxidation property) (see Weisgraber 1990, J. Lipid Res. 31(8):1503-11; Hixson and

        Apolipoproteins utilized in the invention also include recombinant, synthetic,
semi-synthetic or purified apolipoproteins. Methods for obtaining apolipoproteins or
equivalents thereof, utilized by the invention are well-known in the art. For example,
apolipoproteins can be separated from plasma or natural products by, for example,
density gradient centrifugation or immunoaffinity chromatography, or produced
synthetically, semi-synthetically or using recombinant DNA techniques known to those
of the art (see, e.g., Mulugeta et al., 1998, J. Chromatogr. 798(1-2): 83-90; Chung et al.,

        Apolipoproteins utilized in the invention further include apolipoprotein agonists
such as peptides and peptide analogues that mimic the activity of ApoA-I, ApoA-I
Milano (ApoA-Im), ApoA-I Paris (ApoA-Ip), ApoA-II, ApoA-IV, and ApoE. For
example, the apolipoprotein can be any of those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,004,925,

        Apolipoprotein agonist peptides or peptide analogues can be synthesized or
manufactured using any technique for peptide synthesis known in the art including, e.g.,
the techniques described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,004,925, 6,037,323 and 6,046,166. For
example, the peptides may be prepared using the solid-phase synthetic technique initially
described by Merrifield (1963, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 85:2149-2154). Other peptide
synthesis techniques may be found in Bodanszky et al., Peptide Synthesis, John Wiley &
Sons, 2d Ed., (1976) and other references readily available to those skilled in the art. A
summary of polypeptide synthesis techniques can be found in Stuart and Young, Solid
Phase Peptide. Synthesis, Pierce Chemical Company, Rockford, Ill., (1984). Peptides
may also be synthesized by solution methods as described in The Proteins, Vol. II, 3d Ed.,
Neurath et. al., Eds., p. 105-237, Academic Press, New York, N.Y. (1976). Appropriate
protective groups for use in different peptide syntheses are described in the above
mentioned texts as well as in McOmie, Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry, Plenum
Press, New York, N.Y. (1973). The peptides of the present invention might also be
prepared by chemical or enzymatic cleavage from larger portions of, for example,
apolipoprotein A-I.
        In certain embodiments, the apolipoprotein can be a mixture of apolipoproteins.
In one embodiment, the apolipoprotein can be a homogeneous mixture, that is, a single
type of apolipoprotein. In another embodiment, the apolipoprotein can be a
heterogeneous mixture of apolipoproteins, that is, a mixture of two or more different
apolipoproteins. Embodiments of heterogenous mixtures of apolipoproteins can comprise,
for example, a mixture of an apolipoprotein from an animal source and an apolipoprotein
from a semi-synthetic source. In certain embodiments, a heterogenous mixture can
comprise, for example, a mixture of ApoA-I and ApoA-I Milano. In certain embodiments,
a heterogeneous mixture can comprise, for example, a mixture of ApoA-I Milano and
ApoA-I Paris. Suitable mixtures for use in the methods and compositions of the invention
will be apparent to one of skill in the art.
        If the apolipoprotein is obtained from natural sources, it can be obtained from a
plant or animal source. If the apolipoprotein is obtained from an animal source, the
apolipoprotein can be from any species. In certain embodiments, the apolipoprotien can
be obtained from an animal source. In certain embodiments, the apolipoprotein can be

LIPID PARTICLES
        The present invention also provides lipid particles comprising one or more of the
cationic lipids described above. Lipid particles include, but are not limited to, liposomes.
As used herein, a liposome is a structure having lipid-containing membranes enclosing an
aqueous interior. Liposomes may have one or more lipid membranes. The invention
contemplates both single-layered liposomes, which are referred to as unilamellar, and
multi-layered liposomes, which are referred to as multilamellar. When complexed with
nucleic acids, lipid particles may also be lipoplexes, which are composed of cationic lipid
bilayers sandwiched between DNA layers, as described, e.g., in Felgner, Scientific
American.
        The lipid particles of the present invention may further comprise one or more
additional lipids and/or other components such as cholesterol. Other lipids may be
included in the liposome compositions of the present invention for a variety of purposes,
such as to prevent lipid oxidation or to attach ligands onto the liposome surface. Any of a
number of lipids may be present in liposomes of the present invention, including
amphipathic, neutral, cationic, and anionic lipids. Such lipids can be used alone or in
combination. Specific examples of additional lipid components that may be present are
described below.
        Additional components that may be present in a lipid particle of the present
invention include bilayer stabilizing components such as polyamide oligomers (see, e.g.,
U.S. Patent No. 6,320,017), peptides, proteins, detergents, lipid-derivatives, such as PEG
coupled to phosphatidylethanolamine and PEG conjugated to ceramides (see, U.S. Patent
No. 5,885,613).
        In particular embodiments, the lipid particles include one or more of a second
amino lipid or cationic lipid, a neutral lipid, a sterol, and a lipid selected to reduce
aggregation of lipid particles during formation, which may result from steric stabilization
of particles which prevents charge-induced aggregation during formation.
                                               57

 WO 2010/054406                                                             PCT/US2009/063933
         Examples of lipids that reduce aggregation of particles during formation include
polyethylene glycol (PEG)-modified lipids, monosialoganglioside Gml, and polyamide
oligomers ("PAO") such as (described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,320,017). Other compounds
with uncharged, hydrophilic, steric-barrier moieties, which prevent aggregation during
formulation, like PEG, Gml or ATTA, can also be coupled to lipids for use as in the
methods and compositions of the invention. ATTA-lipids are described, e.g., in U.S.
Patent No. 6,320,017, and PEG-lipid conjugates are described, e.g., in U.S. Patent Nos.
5,820,873, 5,534,499 and 5,885,613. Typically, the concentration of the lipid component
selected to reduce aggregation is about 1 to 15% (by mole percent of lipids).
         Specific examples of PEG-modified lipids (or lipid-polyoxyethylene conjugates)
that are useful in the present invention can have a variety of "anchoring" lipid portions to
secure the PEG portion to the surface of the lipid vesicle. Examples of suitable PEG
modified lipids include PEG-modified phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidic acid,
PEG-ceramide conjugates (e.g., PEG-CerCl4 or PEG-CerC20) which are described in
co-pending USSN 08/486,214, incorporated herein by reference, PEG-modified
dialkylamines and PEG-modified 1,2-diacyloxypropan-3-amines. Particularly preferred
are PEG-modified diacylglycerols and dialkylglycerols.
         In embodiments where a sterically-large moiety such as PEG or ATTA are
conjugated to a lipid anchor, the selection of the lipid anchor depends on what type of
association the conjugate is to have with the lipid particle. It is well known that mPEG
(mw2000)-diastearoylphosphatidylethanolamine (PEG-DSPE) will remain associated
with a liposome until the particle is cleared from the circulation, possibly a matter of
days. Other conjugates, such as PEG-CerC20 have similar staying capacity. PEG
CerC 14, however, rapidly exchanges out of the formulation upon exposure to serum, with
a Tm/2 less than 60 mins. in some assays. As illustrated in U.S. Pat. Application SN
08/486,214, at least three characteristics influence the rate of exchange: length of acyl
chain, saturation of acyl chain, and size of the steric-barrier head group. Compounds
having suitable variations of these features may be useful for the invention. For some
therapeutic applications it may be preferable for the PEG-modified lipid to be rapidly lost
from the nucleic acid-lipid particle in vivo and hence the PEG-modified lipid will possess
relatively short lipid anchors. In other therapeutic applications it may be preferable for
                                              58

 WO 2010/054406                                                              PCT/US2009/063933
the nucleic acid-lipid particle to exhibit a longer plasma circulation lifetime and hence the
PEG-modified lipid will possess relatively longer lipid anchors.
         It should be noted that aggregation preventing compounds do not necessarily
require lipid conjugation to function properly. Free PEG or free ATTA in solution may
be sufficient to prevent aggregation. If the particles are stable after formulation, the PEG
or ATTA can be dialyzed away before administration to a subject.
        Neutral lipids, when present in the lipid particle, can be any of a number of lipid
species which exist either in an uncharged or neutral zwitterionic form at physiological
pH. Such lipids include, for example diacylphosphatidylcholine,
diacylphosphatidylethanolamine, ceramide, sphingomyelin, dihydrosphingomyelin,
cephalin, and cerebrosides. The selection of neutral lipids for use in the particles
described herein is generally guided by consideration of, e.g., liposome size and stability
of the liposomes in the bloodstream. Preferably, the neutral lipid component is a lipid
having two acyl groups, (i.e., diacylphosphatidylcholine and
diacylphosphatidylethanolamine). Lipids having a variety of acyl chain groups of
varying chain length and degree of saturation are available or may be isolated or
synthesized by well-known techniques. In one group of embodiments, lipids containing
saturated fatty acids with carbon chain lengths in the range of CIO to C20 are preferred. In
another group of embodiments, lipids with mono or diunsaturated fatty acids with carbon
chain lengths in the range of CIO to C20 are used. Additionally, lipids having mixtures of
saturated and unsaturated fatty acid chains can be used. Preferably, the neutral lipids
used in the present invention are DOPE, DSPC, POPC, DPPC or any related
phosphatidylcholine. The neutral lipids useful in the present invention may also be
composed of sphingomyelin, dihydrosphingomyeline, or phospholipids with other head
groups, such as serine and inositol.
         The sterol component of the lipid mixture, when present, can be any of those
sterols conventionally used in the field of liposome, lipid vesicle or lipid particle
preparation. A preferred sterol is cholesterol.
         Other cationic lipids, which carry a net positive charge at about physiological pH,
in addition to those specifically described above, may also be included in lipid particles
of the present invention. Such cationic lipids include, but are not limited to, N,N-dioleyl

("DMRIE"). Additionally, a number of commercial preparations of cationic lipids can be
used, such as, e.g., LIPOFECTIN (including DOTMA and DOPE, available from
GIBCO/BRL), and LIPOFECTAMINE (comprising DOSPA and DOPE, available from
GIBCO/BRL).       In particular embodiments, a cationic lipid is an amino lipid.
         Anionic lipids suitable for use in lipid particles of the present invention include,
but are not limited to, phosphatidylglycerol, cardiolipin, diacylphosphatidylserine,
diacylphosphatidic acid, N-dodecanoyl phosphatidylethanoloamine, N-succinyl
phosphatidylethanolamine, N-glutaryl phosphatidylethanolamine,
lysylphosphatidylglycerol, and other anionic modifying groups joined to neutral lipids.
         In numerous embodiments, amphipathic lipids are included in lipid particles of
the present invention. "Amphipathic lipids" refer to any suitable material, wherein the
hydrophobic portion of the lipid material orients into a hydrophobic phase, while the
hydrophilic portion orients toward the aqueous phase. Such compounds include, but are
not limited to, phospholipids, aminolipids, and sphingolipids. Representative
phospholipids include sphingomyelin, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine,
phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidic acid, palmitoyloleoyl
phosphatdylcholine, lysophosphatidylcholine, lysophosphatidylethanolamine,
dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine, dioleoylphosphatidylcholine,
distearoylphosphatidylcholine, or dilinoleoylphosphatidylcholine. Other phosphorus
lacking compounds, such as sphingolipids, glycosphingolipid families, diacylglycerols,

and    -acyloxyacids, can also be used. Additionally, such amphipathic lipids can be
readily mixed with other lipids, such as triglycerides and sterols.
        Also suitable for inclusion in the lipid particles of the present invention are
programmable fusion lipids. Such lipid particles have little tendency to fuse with cell
membranes and deliver their payload until a given signal event occurs. This allows the
lipid particle to distribute more evenly after injection into an organism or disease site
before it starts fusing with cells. The signal event can be, for example, a change in pH,
temperature, ionic environment, or time. In the latter case, a fusion delaying or
"cloaking" component, such as an ATTA-lipid conjugate or a PEG-lipid conjugate, can
simply exchange out of the lipid particle membrane over time. By the time the lipid
particle is suitably distributed in the body, it has lost sufficient cloaking agent so as to be
fusogenic. With other signal events, it is desirable to choose a signal that is associated
with the disease site or target cell, such as increased temperature at a site of
inflammation.
        In certain embodiments, it is desirable to target the lipid particles of this invention
using targeting moieties that are specific to a cell type or tissue. Targeting of lipid
particles using a variety of targeting moieties, such as ligands, cell surface receptors,
glycoproteins, vitamins (e.g., riboflavin) and monoclonal antibodies, has been previously
described (see, e.g., U.S. Patent Nos. 4,957,773 and 4,603,044). The targeting moieties
can comprise the entire protein or fragments thereof. Targeting mechanisms generally
require that the targeting agents be positioned on the surface of the lipid particle in such a
manner that the target moiety is available for interaction with the target, for example, a
cell surface receptor. A variety of different targeting agents and methods are known and
available in the art, including those described, e.g., in Sapra, P. and Allen, TM, Prog.
Lipid Res. 42(5):439-62 (2003); and Abra, RM et al., J. Liposome Res. 12:1-3, (2002).
        The use of lipid particles, i.e., liposomes, with a surface coating of hydrophilic
polymer chains, such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) chains, for targeting has been
proposed (Allen, et al., Biochimica et Biophysica Acta 1237: 99-108 (1995); DeFrees, et
al., Journalof the American Chemistry Society 118: 6101-6104 (1996); Blume, et al.,

Zalipsky, in Stealth Liposomes Chapter 9 (Lasic and Martin, Eds) CRC Press, Boca
Raton Fl (1995). In one approach, a ligand, such as an antibody, for targeting the lipid
particle is linked to the polar head group of lipids forming the lipid particle. In another
approach, the targeting ligand is attached to the distal ends of the PEG chains forming the
hydrophilic polymer coating (Klibanov, et al., JournalofLiposome Research 2: 321-334
(1992); Kirpotin et al., FEBS Letters 388: 115-118 (1996)).
        Standard methods for coupling the target agents can be used. For example,
phosphatidylethanolamine, which can be activated for attachment of target agents, or
derivatized lipophilic compounds, such as lipid-derivatized bleomycin, can be used.
Antibody-targeted liposomes can be constructed using, for instance, liposomes that
incorporate protein A (see, Renneisen, et al., J. Bio. Chem., 265:16337-16342 (1990) and
Leonetti, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (USA), 87:2448-2451 (1990). Other examples of
antibody conjugation are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 6,027,726, the teachings of which
are incorporated herein by reference. Examples of targeting moieties can also include
other proteins, specific to cellular components, including antigens associated with
neoplasms or tumors. Proteins used as targeting moieties can be attached to the
liposomes via covalent bonds (see, Heath, Covalent Attachment ofProteinsto
Liposomes, 149 Methods in Enzymology 111-119 (Academic Press, Inc. 1987)). Other
targeting methods include the biotin-avidin system.
        In one exemplary embodiment, the lipid particle comprises a mixture of a cationic
lipid of the present invention, neutral lipids (other than a cationic lipid), a sterol (e.g.,
cholesterol) and a PEG-modified lipid (e.g., a PEG-DMG or PEG-DMA). In certain
embodiments, the lipid mixture consists of or consists essentially of a cationic lipid of the
present invention, a neutral lipid, cholesterol, and a PEG-modified lipid. In further
preferred embodiments, the lipid particle consists of or consists essentially of the above

        In particular embodiments, the lipid particle consists of or consists essentially of a
cationic lipid chosen from Table 1 or Table 2, DSPC, Chol, and either PEG-DMG or

Therapeutic Agent-Lipid Particle Compositions and Formulations
         The present invention includes compositions comprising a lipid particle of the
present invention and an active agent, wherein the active agent is associated with the lipid
particle. In particular embodiments, the active agent is a therapeutic agent. In particular
embodiments, the active agent is encapsulated within an aqueous interior of the lipid
particle. In other embodiments, the active agent is present within one or more lipid layers
of the lipid particle. In other embodiments, the active agent is bound to the exterior or
interior lipid surface of a lipid particle.
         "Fully encapsulated" as used herein indicates that the nucleic acid in the particles
is not significantly degraded after exposure to serum or a nuclease assay that would
significantly degrade free nucleic acids. In a fully encapsulated system, preferably less
than 25% of particle nucleic acid is degraded in a treatment that would normally degrade
100% of free nucleic acid, more preferably less than 10% and most preferably less than
5% of the particle nucleic acid is degraded. Alternatively, full encapsulation may be
determined by an Oligreen* assay. Oligreen* is an ultra-sensitive fluorescent nucleic
acid stain for quantitating oligonucleotides and single-stranded DNA in solution
                                              63

(available from Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, CA). Fully encapsulated also suggests
that the particles are serum stable, that is, that they do not rapidly decompose into their
component parts upon in vivo administration.
         Active agents, as used herein, include any molecule or compound capable of
exerting a desired effect on a cell, tissue, organ, or subject. Such effects may be
biological, physiological, or cosmetic, for example. Active agents may be any type of
molecule or compound, including e.g., nucleic acids, peptides and polypeptides,
including, e.g., antibodies, such as, e.g., polyclonal antibodies, monoclonal antibodies,
antibody fragments; humanized antibodies, recombinant antibodies, recombinant human
antibodies, and PrimatizedTM antibodies, cytokines, growth factors, apoptotic factors,
differentiation-inducing factors, cell surface receptors and their ligands; hormones; and
small molecules, including small organic molecules or compounds.
         In one embodiment, the active agent is a therapeutic agent, or a salt or derivative
thereof. Therapeutic agent derivatives may be therapeutically active themselves or they
may be prodrugs, which become active upon further modification. Thus, in one
embodiment, a therapeutic agent derivative retains some or all of the therapeutic activity
as compared to the unmodified agent, while in another embodiment, a therapeutic agent
derivative lacks therapeutic activity.
         In various embodiments, therapeutic agents include any therapeutically effective
agent or drug, such as anti-inflammatory compounds, anti-depressants, stimulants,
analgesics, antibiotics, birth control medication, antipyretics, vasodilators, anti
angiogenics, cytovascular agents, signal transduction inhibitors, cardiovascular drugs,
e.g., anti-arrhythmic agents, vasoconstrictors, hormones, and steroids.
         In certain embodiments, the therapeutic agent is an oncology drug, which may
also be referred to as an anti-tumor drug, an anti-cancer drug, a tumor drug, an
antineoplastic agent, or the like. Examples of oncology drugs that may be used according
to the invention include, but are not limited to, adriamycin, alkeran, allopurinol,

Nucleic Acid-Lipid Particles
        In certain embodiments, lipid particles of the present invention are associated with
a nucleic acid, resulting in a nucleic acid-lipid particle. In particular embodiments, the
nucleic acid is fully encapsulated in the lipid particle. As used herein, the term "nucleic
acid" is meant to include any oligonucleotide or polynucleotide. Fragments containing
up to 50 nucleotides are generally termed oligonucleotides, and longer fragments are
called polynucleotides. In particular embodiments, oligonucletoides of the present
invention are 15-50 nucleotides in length.
        In the context of this invention, the terms "polynucleotide" and "oligonucleotide"
refer to a polymer or oligomer of nucleotide or nucleoside monomers consisting of
naturally occurring bases, sugars and intersugar (backbone) linkages. The terms
"polynucleotide" and "oligonucleotide" also includes polymers or oligomers comprising
non-naturally occurring monomers, or portions thereof, which function similarly. Such
modified or substituted oligonucleotides are often preferred over native forms because of
properties such as, for example, enhanced cellular uptake and increased stability in the
presence of nucleases.
        The nucleic acid that is present in a lipid-nucleic acid particle according to this
invention includes any form of nucleic acid that is known. The nucleic acids used herein
                                               65

 WO 2010/054406                                                            PCT/US2009/063933
can be single-stranded DNA or RNA, or double-stranded DNA or RNA, or DNA-RNA
hybrids. Examples of double-stranded DNA include structural genes, genes including
control and termination regions, and self-replicating systems such as viral or plasmid
DNA. Examples of double-stranded RNA include siRNA and other RNA interference
reagents. Single-stranded nucleic acids include, e.g., antisense oligonucleotides,
ribozymes, microRNA, and triplex-forming oligonucleotides. The nucleic acid that is
present in a lipid-nucleic acid particle of this invention may include one or more of the
oligonucleotide modifications described below.
        Nucleic acids of the present invention may be of various lengths, generally
dependent upon the particular form of nucleic acid. For example, in particular
embodiments, plasmids or genes may be from about 1,000 to 100,000 nucleotide residues
in length. In particular embodiments, oligonucleotides may range from about 10 to 100
nucleotides in length. In various related embodiments, oligonucleotides, single-stranded,
double-stranded, and triple-stranded, may range in length from about 10 to about 50
nucleotides, from about 20 o about 50 nucleotides, from about 15 to about 30 nucleotides,
from about 20 to about 30 nucleotides in length.
        In particular embodiments, the oligonucleotide (or a strand thereof) of the present
invention specifically hybridizes to or is complementary to a target polynucleotide.
"Specifically hybridizable" and "complementary" are terms which are used to indicate a
sufficient degree of complementarity such that stable and specific binding occurs
between the DNA or RNA target and the oligonucleotide. It is understood that an
oligonucleotide need not be 100% complementary to its target nucleic acid sequence to
be specifically hybridizable. An oligonucleotide is specifically hybridizable when
binding of the oligonucleotide to the target interferes with the normal function of the
target molecule to cause a loss of utility or expression therefrom, and there is a sufficient
degree of complementarity to avoid non-specific binding of the oligonucleotide to non
target sequences under conditions in which specific binding is desired, i.e., under
physiological conditions in the case of in vivo assays or therapeutic treatment, or, in the
case of in vitro assays, under conditions in which the assays are conducted. Thus, in
other embodiments, this oligonucleotide includes 1, 2, or 3 base substitutions, e.g.
                                               66

mismatches, as compared to the region of a gene or mRNA sequence that it is targeting or
to which it specifically hybridizes.
RNA Interference Nucleic Acids
         In particular embodiments, nucleic acid-lipid particles of the present invention are
associated with RNA interference (RNAi) molecules. RNA interference methods using
RNAi molecules may be used to disrupt the expression of a gene or polynucleotide of
interest. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) has essentially replaced antisense ODN and
ribozymes as the next generation of targeted oligonucleotide drugs under development.
          SiRNAs are RNA duplexes normally 16-30 nucleotides long that can associate
with a cytoplasmic multi-protein complex known as RNAi-induced silencing complex
(RISC). RISC loaded with siRNA mediates the degradation of homologous mRNA
transcripts, therefore siRNA can be designed to knock down protein expression with high
specificity. Unlike other antisense technologies, siRNA function through a natural
mechanism evolved to control gene expression through non-coding RNA. This is
generally considered to be the reason why their activity is more potent in vitro and in vivo
than either antisense ODN or ribozymes. A variety of RNAi reagents, including siRNAs
targeting clinically relevant targets, are currently under pharmaceutical development, as
described, e.g., in de Fougerolles, A. et al., Nature Reviews 6:443-453 (2007).
         While the first described RNAi molecules were RNA:RNA hybrids comprising
both an RNA sense and an RNA antisense strand, it has now been demonstrated that
DNA sense:RNA antisense hybrids, RNA sense:DNA antisense hybrids, and DNA:DNA
hybrids are capable of mediating RNAi (Lamberton, J.S. and Christian, A.T., (2003)
Molecular Biotechnology 24:111-119). Thus, the invention includes the use of RNAi
molecules comprising any of these different types of double-stranded molecules. In
addition, it is understood that RNAi molecules may be used and introduced to cells in a
variety of forms. Accordingly, as used herein, RNAi molecules encompasses any and all
molecules capable of inducing an RNAi response in cells, including, but not limited to,
double-stranded oligonucleotides comprising two separate strands, i.e. a sense strand and
an antisense strand, e.g., small interfering RNA (siRNA); double-stranded
oligonucleotide comprising two separate strands that are linked together by non
                                               67

  WO 2010/054406                                                             PCT/US2009/063933
nucleotidyl linker; oligonucleotides comprising a hairpin loop of complementary
sequences, which forms a double-stranded region, e.g., shRNAi molecules, and
expression vectors that express one or more polynucleotides capable of forming a double
stranded polynucleotide alone or in combination with another polynucleotide.
        A "single strand siRNA compound" as used herein, is an siRNA compound which
is made up of a single molecule. It may include a duplexed region, formed by intra
strand pairing, e.g., it may be, or include, a hairpin or pan-handle structure. Single strand
siRNA compounds may be antisense with regard to the target molecule
        A single strand siRNA compound may be sufficiently long that it can enter the
RISC and participate in RISC mediated cleavage of a target mRNA. A single strand
siRNA compound is at least 14, and in other embodiments at least 15, 20, 25, 29, 35, 40,
or 50 nucleotides in length. In certain embodiments, it is less than 200, 100, or 60
nucleotides in length.
        Hairpin siRNA compounds will have a duplex region equal to or at least 17, 18,
19, 29, 21, 22, 23, 24, or 25 nucleotide pairs. The duplex region will may be equal to or
less than 200, 100, or 50, in length. In certain embodiments, ranges for the duplex region
are 15-30, 17 to 23, 19 to 23, and 19 to 21 nucleotides pairs in length. The hairpin may
have a single strand overhang or terminal unpaired region. In certain embodiments, the
overhangs are 2-3 nucleotides in length. In some embodiments, the overhang is at the
sense side of the hairpin and in some embodiments on the antisense side of the hairpin.
        A "double stranded siRNA compound" as used herein, is an siRNA compound
which includes more than one, and in some cases two, strands in which interchain
hybridization can form a region of duplex structure.
        The antisense strand of a double stranded siRNA compound may be equal to or at
least, 14, 15, 16 17, 18, 19, 25, 29, 40, or 60 nucleotides in length. It may be equal to or
less than 200, 100, or 50, nucleotides in length. Ranges may be 17 to 25, 19 to 23, and 19
to2l nucleotides in length. As used herein, term "antisense strand" means the strand of
an siRNA compound that is sufficiently complementary to a target molecule, e.g. a target
RNA.

         The sense strand of a double stranded siRNA compound may be equal to or at
least 14, 15, 16 17, 18, 19, 25, 29, 40, or 60 nucleotides in length. It may be equal to or
less than 200, 100, or 50, nucleotides in length. Ranges may be 17 to 25, 19 to 23, and 19
to 21 nucleotides in length.
         The double strand portion of a double stranded siRNA compound may be equal to
or at least, 14, 15, 16 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 29, 40, or 60 nucleotide pairs in
length. It may be equal to or less than 200, 100, or 50, nucleotides pairs in length.
Ranges may be 15-30, 17 to 23, 19 to 23, and 19 to 21 nucleotides pairs in length.
         In many embodiments, the siRNA compound is sufficiently large that it can be
cleaved by an endogenous molecule, e.g., by Dicer, to produce smaller siRNA
compounds, e.g., siRNAs agents
         The sense and antisense strands may be chosen such that the double-stranded
siRNA compound includes a single strand or unpaired region at one or both ends of the
molecule. Thus, a double-stranded siRNA compound may contain sense and antisense
strands, paired to contain an overhang, e.g., one or two 5' or 3' overhangs, or a 3'
overhang of 1 - 3 nucleotides. The overhangs can be the result of one strand being longer
than the other, or the result of two strands of the same length being staggered. Some
embodiments will have at least one 3' overhang. In one embodiment, both ends of an
siRNA molecule will have a 3' overhang. In some embodiments, the overhang is 2
nucleotides.
         In certain embodiments, the length for the duplexed region is between 15 and 30,
or 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, and 23 nucleotides in length, e.g., in the ssiRNA compound range
discussed above. ssiRNA compounds can resemble in length and structure the natural
Dicer processed products from long dsiRNAs. Embodiments in which the two strands of
the ssiRNA compound are linked, e.g., covalently linked are also included. Hairpin, or
other single strand structures which provide the required double stranded region, and a 3'
overhang are also within the invention.
         The siRNA compounds described herein, including double-stranded siRNA
compounds and single-stranded siRNA compounds can mediate silencing of a target
RNA, e.g., mRNA, e.g., a transcript of a gene that encodes a protein. For convenience,

 WO 2010/054406                                                            PCT/US2009/063933
such mRNA is also referred to herein as mRNA to be silenced. Such a gene is also
referred to as a target gene. In general, the RNA to be silenced is an endogenous gene or
a pathogen gene. In addition, RNAs other than mRNA, e.g., tRNAs, and viral RNAs, can
also be targeted.
        As used herein, the phrase "mediates RNAi" refers to the ability to silence, in a
sequence specific manner, a target RNA. While not wishing to be bound by theory, it is
believed that silencing uses the RNAi machinery or process and a guide RNA, e.g., an
ssiRNA compound of 21 to 23 nucleotides.
        In one embodiment, an siRNA compound is "sufficiently complementary" to a
target RNA, e.g., a target mRNA, such that the siRNA compound silences production of
protein encoded by the target mRNA. In another embodiment, the siRNA compound is
"exactly complementary" to a target RNA, e.g., the target RNA and the siRNA
compound anneal, for example to form a hybrid made exclusively of Watson-Crick base
pairs in the region of exact complementarity. A "sufficiently complementary" target
RNA can include an internal region (e.g., of at least 10 nucleotides) that is exactly
complementary to a target RNA. Moreover, in certain embodiments, the siRNA
compound specifically discriminates a single-nucleotide difference. In this case, the
siRNA compound only mediates RNAi if exact complementary is found in the region
(e.g., within 7 nucleotides of) the single-nucleotide difference.
MicroRNAs
        Micro RNAs (miRNAs) are a highly conserved class of small RNA molecules
that are transcribed from DNA in the genomes of plants and animals, but are not
translated into protein. Processed miRNAs are single stranded ~17-25 nucleotide (nt)
RNA molecules that become incorporated into the RNA-induced silencing complex
(RISC) and have been identified as key regulators of development, cell proliferation,
apoptosis and differentiation. They are believed to play a role in regulation of gene
expression by binding to the 3'-untranslated region of specific mRNAs. RISC mediates
down-regulation of gene expression through translational inhibition, transcript cleavage,
or both. RISC is also implicated in transcriptional silencing in the nucleus of a wide
range of eukaryotes.

Antisense Oligonucleotides
         In one embodiment, a nucleic acid is an antisense oligonucleotide directed to a
target polynucleotide. The term "antisense oligonucleotide" or simply "antisense" is
meant to include oligonucleotides that are complementary to a targeted polynucleotide
sequence. Antisense oligonucleotides are single strands of DNA or RNA that are
complementary to a chosen sequence, e.g. a target gene mRNA. Antisense
oligonucleotides are thought to inhibit gene expression by binding to a complementary
mRNA. Binding to the target mRNA can lead to inhibition of gene expression by
through making the
         either by preventing translation of complementary mRNA strands by binding to it
or by leading to degradation of the target mRNA Antisense DNA can be used to target a
specific, complementary (coding or non-coding) RNA. If binding takes places this
DNA/RNA hybrid can be degraded by the enzyme RNase H. In particular embodiment,
antisense oligonucleotides contain from about 10 to about 50 nucleotides, more
preferably about 15 to about 30 nucleotides. The term also encompasses antisense
oligonucleotides that may not be exactly complementary to the desired target gene. Thus,
the invention can be utilized in instances where non-target specific-activities are found
with antisense, or where an antisense sequence containing one or more mismatches with
the target sequence is the most preferred for a particular use.
         Antisense oligonucleotides have been demonstrated to be effective and targeted
inhibitors of protein synthesis, and, consequently, can be used to specifically inhibit
protein synthesis by a targeted gene. The efficacy of antisense oligonucleotides for
inhibiting protein synthesis is well established. For example, the synthesis of
polygalactauronase and the muscarine type 2 acetylcholine receptor are inhibited by
                                              71

antisense oligonucleotides directed to their respective mRNA sequences (U. S. Patent
5,739,119 and U. S. Patent 5,759,829). Further, examples of antisense inhibition have
been demonstrated with the nuclear protein cyclin, the multiple drug resistance gene
(MDG 1), ICAM- 1, E-selectin, STK- 1, striatal GABAA receptor and human EGF
(Jaskulski et al., Science. 1988 Jun 10;240(4858):1544-6; Vasanthakumar and Ahmed,

and U.S. Patent 5,610,288). Furthermore, antisense constructs have also been described
that inhibit and can be used to treat a variety of abnormal cellular proliferations, e.g.

        Methods of producing antisense oligonucleotides are known in the art and can be
readily adapted to produce an antisense oligonucleotide that targets any polynucleotide
sequence. Selection of antisense oligonucleotide sequences specific for a given target
sequence is based upon analysis of the chosen target sequence and determination of
secondary structure, Tm, binding energy, and relative stability. Antisense
oligonucleotides may be selected based upon their relative inability to form dimers,
hairpins, or other secondary structures that would reduce or prohibit specific binding to
the target mRNA in a host cell. Highly preferred target regions of the mRNA include
those regions at or near the AUG translation initiation codon and those sequences that are
substantially complementary to 5' regions of the mRNA. These secondary structure
analyses and target site selection considerations can be performed, for example, using v.4
of the OLIGO primer analysis software (Molecular Biology Insights) and/or the
BLASTN 2.0.5 algorithm software (Altschul et al., Nucleic Acids Res. 1997,
25(17):3389-402).
Antagomirs
        Antagomirs are RNA-like oligonucleotides that harbor various modifications for
RNAse protection and pharmacologic properties, such as enhanced tissue and cellular
uptake. They differ from normal RNA by, for example, complete 2'-O-methylation of
sugar, phosphorothioate backbone and, for example, a cholesterol-moiety at 3'-end.
Antagomirs may be used to efficiently silence endogenous miRNAs by forming duplexes
comprising the antagomir and endogenous miRNA, thereby preventing miRNA-induced

gene silencing. An example of antagomir-mediated miRNA silencing is the silencing of
miR-122, described in Krutzfeldt et al, Nature, 2005, 438: 685-689, which is expressly
incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. Antagomir RNAs may be synthesized
using standard solid phase oligonucleotide synthesis protocols. See U.S. Patent
Application Ser. Nos. 11/502,158 and 11/657,341 (the disclosure of each of which are
incorporated herein by reference).
        An antagomir can include ligand-conjugated monomer subunits and monomers
for oligonucleotide synthesis. Exemplary monomers are described in U.S. Application
No. 10/916,185, filed on August 10, 2004. An antagomir can have a ZXY structure, such
as is described in PCT Application No. PCT/US2004/07070 filed on March 8, 2004. An
antagomir can be complexed with an amphipathic moiety. Exemplary amphipathic
moieties for use with oligonucleotide agents are described in PCT Application
No. PCT/US2004/07070, filed on March 8, 2004.
Aptamers
        Aptamers are nucleic acid or peptide molecules that bind to a particular molecule
of interest with high affinity and specificity (Tuerk and Gold, Science 249:505 (1990);
Ellington and Szostak, Nature 346:818 (1990)). DNA or RNA aptamers have been
successfully produced which bind many different entities from large proteins to small
organic molecules. See Eaton, Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1:10-16 (1997), Famulok, Curr.
Opin. Struct. Biol. 9:324-9(1999), and Hermann and Patel, Science 287:820-5 (2000).
Aptamers may be RNA or DNA based, and may include a riboswitch. A riboswitch is a
part of an mRNA molecule that can directly bind a small target molecule, and whose
binding of the target affects the gene's activity. Thus, an mRNA that contains a
riboswitch is directly involved in regulating its own activity, depending on the presence
or absence of its target molecule. Generally, aptamers are engineered through repeated
rounds of in vitro selection or equivalently, SELEX (systematic evolution of ligands by
exponential enrichment) to bind to various molecular targets such as small molecules,
proteins, nucleic acids, and even cells, tissues and organisms. The aptamer may be
prepared by any known method, including synthetic, recombinant, and purification
methods, and may be used alone or in combination with other aptamers specific for the
same target. Further, as described more fully herein, the term "aptamer" specifically
                                               73

  WO 2010/054406                                                             PCT/US2009/063933
includes "secondary aptamers" containing a consensus sequence derived from comparing
two or more known aptamers to a given target.
Ribozymes
        According to another embodiment of the invention, nucleic acid-lipid particles are
associated with ribozymes. Ribozymes are RNA molecules complexes having specific
catalytic domains that possess endonuclease activity (Kim and Cech, Proc Natl Acad Sci
U S A. 1987 Dec;84(24):8788-92; Forster and Symons, Cell. 1987 Apr 24;49(2):211-20).
For example, a large number of ribozymes accelerate phosphoester transfer reactions with
a high degree of specificity, often cleaving only one of several phosphoesters in an
oligonucleotide substrate (Cech et al., Cell. 1981 Dec;27(3 Pt 2):487-96; Michel and
Westhof, J Mol Biol. 1990 Dec 5;216(3):585-610; Reinhold-Hurek and Shub, Nature.
1992 May 14;357(6374):173-6). This specificity has been attributed to the requirement
that the substrate bind via specific base-pairing interactions to the internal guide sequence
("IGS") of the ribozyme prior to chemical reaction.
        At least six basic varieties of naturally-occurring enzymatic RNAs are known
presently. Each can catalyze the hydrolysis of RNA phosphodiester bonds in trans (and
thus can cleave other RNA molecules) under physiological conditions. In general,
enzymatic nucleic acids act by first binding to a target RNA. Such binding occurs
through the target binding portion of a enzymatic nucleic acid which is held in close
proximity to an enzymatic portion of the molecule that acts to cleave the target RNA.
Thus, the enzymatic nucleic acid first recognizes and then binds a target RNA through
complementary base-pairing, and once bound to the correct site, acts enzymatically to cut
the target RNA. Strategic cleavage of such a target RNA will destroy its ability to direct
synthesis of an encoded protein. After an enzymatic nucleic acid has bound and cleaved
its RNA target, it is released from that RNA to search for another target and can
repeatedly bind and cleave new targets.
        The enzymatic nucleic acid molecule may be formed in a hammerhead, hairpin, a
hepatitis 6 virus, group I intron or RNaseP RNA (in association with an RNA guide
sequence) or Neurospora VS RNA motif, for example. Specific examples of
hammerhead motifs are described by Rossi et al. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992 Sep
11;20(17):4559-65. Examples of hairpin motifs are described by Hampel et al. (Eur. Pat.
                                               74

  WO 2010/054406                                                            PCT/US2009/063933
Apple. Publ. No. EP 0360257), Hampel and Tritz, Biochemistry 1989 Jun 13;28(12):4929

5,631,359. An example of the hepatitis      virus motif is described by Perrotta and Been,
Biochemistry. 1992 Dec 1;31(47):11843-52; an example of the RNaseP motif is
described by Guerrier-Takada et al., Cell. 1983 Dec;35(3 Pt 2):849-57; Neurospora VS
RNA ribozyme motif is described by Collins (Saville and Collins, Cell. 1990 May
 18;61(4):685-96; Saville and Collins, Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1991 Oct
 1;88(19):8826-30; Collins and Olive, Biochemistry. 1993 Mar 23;32(11):2795-9); and an
example of the Group I intron is described in U. S. Patent 4,987,071. Important
characteristics of enzymatic nucleic acid molecules used according to the invention are
that they have a specific substrate binding site which is complementary to one or more of
the target gene DNA or RNA regions, and that they have nucleotide sequences within or
surrounding that substrate binding site which impart an RNA cleaving activity to the
molecule. Thus the ribozyme constructs need not be limited to specific motifs mentioned
herein.
         Methods of producing a ribozyme targeted to any polynucleotide sequence are
known in the art. Ribozymes may be designed as described in Int. Pat. Appl. Publ. No.
WO 93/23569 and Int. Pat. Appl. Publ. No. WO 94/02595, each specifically incorporated
herein by reference, and synthesized to be tested in vitro and in vivo, as described therein.
         Ribozyme activity can be optimized by altering the length of the ribozyme
binding arms or chemically synthesizing ribozymes with modifications that prevent their
degradation by serum ribonucleases (see e.g., Int. Pat. Appl. Publ. No. WO 92/07065; Int.
Pat. Appl. Publ. No. WO 93/15187; Int. Pat. Appl. Publ. No. WO 91/03162; Eur. Pat.
Appl. Publ. No. 92110298.4; U. S. Patent 5,334,711; and Int. Pat. Appl. Publ. No. WO
94/13688, which describe various chemical modifications that can be made to the sugar
moieties of enzymatic RNA molecules), modifications which enhance their efficacy in
cells, and removal of stem II bases to shorten RNA synthesis times and reduce chemical
requirements.
Immunostimulatorv Oligonucleotides
        Nucleic acids associated with lipid particles of the present invention may be
immunostimulatory, including immunostimulatory oligonucleotides (ISS; single-or
                                             75

 WO 2010/054406                                                            PCT/US2009/063933
double-stranded) capable of inducing an immune response when administered to a
subject, which may be a mammal or other patient. ISS include, e.g., certain palindromes
leading to hairpin secondary structures (see Yamamoto S., et al. (1992) J. Immunol. 148:
4072-4076), or CpG motifs, as well as other known ISS features (such as multi-G
domains, see WO 96/11266).
        The immune response may be an innate or an adaptive immune response. The
immune system is divided into a more innate immune system, and acquired adaptive
immune system of vertebrates, the latter of which is further divided into humoral cellular
components. In particular embodiments, the immune response may be mucosal.
        In particular embodiments, an immunostimulatory nucleic acid is only
immunostimulatory when administered in combination with a lipid particle, and is not
immunostimulatory when administered in its "free form." According to the present
invention, such an oligonucleotide is considered to be immunostimulatory.
        Immunostimulatory nucleic acids are considered to be non-sequence specific
when it is not required that they specifically bind to and reduce the expression of a target
polynucleotide in order to provoke an immune response. Thus, certain
immunostimulatory nucleic acids may comprise a seuqence correspondign to a region of
a naturally occurring gene or mRNA, but they may still be considered non-sequence
specific immunostimulatory nucleic acids.
        In one embodiment, the immunostimulatory nucleic acid or oligonucleotide
comprises at least one CpG dinucleotide. The oligonucleotide or CpG dinucleotide may
be unmethylated or methylated. In another embodiment, the immunostimulatory nucleic
acid comprises at least one CpG dinucleotide having a methylated cytosine. In one
embodiment, the nucleic acid comprises a single CpG dinucleotide, wherein the cytosine
in said CpG dinucleotide is methylated. In a specific embodiment, the nucleic acid
comprises the sequence 5' TAACGTTGAGGGGCAT 3'. In an alternative embodiment,
the nucleic acid comprises at least two CpG dinucleotides, wherein at least one cytosine
in the CpG dinucleotides is methylated. In a further embodiment, each cytosine in the
CpG dinucleotides present in the sequence is methylated. In another embodiment, the
nucleic acid comprises a plurality of CpG dinucleotides, wherein at least one of said CpG
dinucleotides comprises a methylated cytosine.

        In one specific embodiment, the nucleic acid comprises the sequence 5'
TTCCATGACGTTCCTGACGT 3'. In another specific embodiment, the nucleic acid
sequence comprises the sequence 5' TCCATGACGTTCCTGACGT 3', wherein the two
cytosines indicated in bold are methylated. In particular embodiments, the ODN is

invention have a phosphodiester ("PO") backbone or a phosphorothioate ("PS")

Decoy Oligonucleotides
        Because transcription factors recognize their relatively short binding sequences,
even in the absence of surrounding genomic DNA, short oligonucleotides bearing the
                                               78

consensus binding sequence of a specific transcription factor can be used as tools for
manipulating gene expression in living cells. This strategy involves the intracellular
delivery of such "decoy oligonucleotides", which are then recognized and bound by the
target factor. Occupation of the transcription factor's DNA-binding site by the decoy
renders the transcription factor incapable of subsequently binding to the promoter regions
of target genes. Decoys can be used as therapeutic agents, either to inhibit the expression
of genes that are activated by a transcription factor, or to upregulate genes that are
suppressed by the binding of a transcription factor. Examples of the utilization of decoy
oligonucleotides may be found in Mann et al., J. Clin. Invest., 2000, 106: 1071-1075,

Supermir
        A supermir refers to a single stranded, double stranded or partially double
stranded oligomer or polymer of ribonucleic acid (RNA) or deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)
or both or modifications thereof, which has a nucleotide sequence that is substantially
identical to an miRNA and that is antisense with respect to its target. This term includes
oligonucleotides composed of naturally-occurring nucleobases, sugars and covalent
internucleoside (backbone) linkages and which contain at least one non-naturally
occurring portion which functions similarly. Such modified or substituted
oligonucleotides are preferred over native forms because of desirable properties such as,
for example, enhanced cellular uptake, enhanced affinity for nucleic acid target and
increased stability in the presence of nucleases. In a preferred embodiment, the supermir
does not include a sense strand, and in another preferred embodiment, the supermir does
not self-hybridize to a significant extent. An supermir featured in the invention can have
secondary structure, but it is substantially single-stranded under physiological conditions.
An supermir that is substantially single-stranded is single-stranded to the extent that less
than about 50% (e.g., less than about 40%, 30%, 20%, 10%, or 5%) of the supermir is
duplexed with itself. The supermir can include a hairpin segment, e.g., sequence,
preferably at the 3' end can self hybridize and form a duplex region, e.g., a duplex region
of at least 1, 2, 3, or 4 and preferably less than 8, 7, 6, or n nucleotides, e.g., 5 nuclotides.
The duplexed region can be connected by a linker, e.g., a nucleotide linker, e.g., 3, 4, 5,
or 6 dTs, e.g., modified dTs. In another embodiment the supermir is duplexed with a
                                                79

shorter oligo, e.g., of 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 nucleotides in length, e.g., at one or both of the 3'

miRNA mimics
         miRNA mimics represent a class of molecules that can be used to imitate the gene
silencing ability of one or more miRNAs. Thus, the term "microRNA mimic" refers to
synthetic non-coding RNAs (i.e. the miRNA is not obtained by purification from a source
of the endogenous miRNA) that are capable of entering the RNAi pathway and regulating
gene expression. miRNA mimics can be designed as mature molecules (e.g. single
stranded) or mimic precursors (e.g., pri- or pre-miRNAs). miRNA mimics can be
comprised of nucleic acid (modified or modified nucleic acids) including
oligonucleotides comprising, without limitation, RNA, modified RNA, DNA, modified
DNA, locked nucleic acids, or 2'-0,4'-C-ethylene-bridged nucleic acids (ENA), or any
combination of the above (including DNA-RNA hybrids). In addition, miRNA mimics
can comprise conjugates that can affect delivery, intracellular compartmentalization,
stability, specificity, functionality, strand usage, and/or potency. In one design, miRNA
mimics are double stranded molecules (e.g., with a duplex region of between about 16
and about 31 nucleotides in length) and contain one or more sequences that have identity
with the mature strand of a given miRNA. Modifications can comprise 2' modifications
(including 2'-O methyl modifications and 2' F modifications) on one or both strands of
the molecule and internucleotide modifications (e.g. phorphorthioate modifications) that
enhance nucleic acid stability and/or specificity. In addition, miRNA mimics can include
overhangs. The overhangs can consist of 1-6 nucleotides on either the 3' or 5' end of
either strand and can be modified to enhance stability or functionality. In one
embodiment, a miRNA mimic comprises a duplex region of between 16 and 31
nucleotides and one or more of the following chemical modification patterns: the sense
strand contains 2'-O-methyl modifications of nucleotides 1 and 2 (counting from the 5'
end of the sense oligonucleotide), and all of the Cs and Us; the antisense strand
modifications can comprise 2' F modification of all of the Cs and Us, phosphorylation of
the 5' end of the oligonucleotide, and stabilized internucleotide linkages associated with a
2 nucleotide 3 'overhang.
Antimir or miRNA inhibitor.

  WO 2010/054406                                                              PCT/US2009/063933
         The terms " antimir" "microRNA inhibitor", "miR inhibitor", or "inhibitor" are
synonymous and refer to oligonucleotides or modified oligonucleotides that interfere with
the ability of specific miRNAs. In general, the inhibitors are nucleic acid or modified
nucleic acids in nature including oligonucleotides comprising RNA, modified RNA,
DNA, modified DNA, locked nucleic acids (LNAs), or any combination of the above.
Modifications include 2' modifications (including 2'-0 alkyl modifications and 2' F
modifications) and internucleotide modifications (e.g. phosphorothioate modifications)
that can affect delivery, stability, specificity, intracellular compartmentalization, or
potency. In addition, miRNA inhibitors can comprise conjugates that can affect delivery,
intracellular compartmentalization, stability, and/or potency. Inhibitors can adopt a
variety of configurations including single stranded, double stranded (RNA/RNA or
RNA/DNA duplexes), and hairpin designs, in general, microRNA inhibitors comprise
contain one or more sequences or portions of sequences that are complementary or
partially complementary with the mature strand (or strands) of the miRNA to be targeted,
in addition, the miRNA inhibitor may also comprise additional sequences located 5' and
3' to the sequence that is the reverse complement of the mature miRNA. The additional
sequences may be the reverse complements of the sequences that are adjacent to the
mature miRNA in the pri-miRNA from which the mature miRNA is derived, or the
additional sequences may be arbitrary sequences (having a mixture of A, G, C, or U). In
some embodiments, one or both of the additional sequences are arbitrary sequences
capable of forming hairpins. Thus, in some embodiments, the sequence that is the reverse
complement of the miRNA is flanked on the 5' side and on the 3' side by hairpin
structures. Micro-RNA inhibitors, when double stranded, may include mismatches
between nucleotides on opposite strands. Furthermore, micro-RNA inhibitors may be
linked to conjugate moieties in order to facilitate uptake of the inhibitor into a cell. For
example, a micro-RNA inhibitor may be linked to cholesteryl 5-(bis(4
methoxyphenyl)(phenyl)methoxy)-3 hydroxypentylcarbamate) which allows passive
uptake of a micro-RNA inhibitor into a cell. Micro-RNA inhibitors, including hairpin
miRNA inhibitors, are described in detail in Vermeulen et al., "Double-Stranded Regions
Are Essential Design Components Of Potent Inhibitors of RISC Function," RNA 13: 723
730 (2007) and in W02007/095387 and WO 2008/036825 each of which is incorporated

herein by reference in its entirety. A person of ordinary skill in the art can select a
sequence from the database for a desired miRNA and design an inhibitor useful for the
methods disclosed herein.
U1 adaptor
Ul adaptor inhibit polyA sites and are bifunctional oligonucleotides with a target domain
complementary to a site in the target gene's terminal exon and a 'U1 domain' that binds
to the Ul smaller nuclear RNA component of the Ul snRNP (Goraczniak, et al., 2008,
Nature Biotechnology, 27(3), 257-263, which is expressly incorporated by reference
herein, in its entirety). Ul snRNP is a ribonucleoprotein complex that functions
primarily to direct early steps in spliceosome formation by binding to the pre-mRNA
exon- intron boundary (Brown and Simpson, 1998, Annu Rev Plant Physiol Plant Mol
Biol 49:77-95). Nucleotides 2-11 of the 5'end of Ul snRNA base pair bind with the 5'ss
of the pre mRNA. In one embodiment, oligonucleotides of the invention are Ul adaptors.
In one embodiment, the Ul adaptor can be administered in combination with at least one
other iRNA agent.
Olionucleotide modifications
        Unmodified oligonucleotides may be less than optimal in some applications, e.g.,
unmodified oligonucleotides can be prone to degradation by e.g., cellular nucleases.
Nucleases can hydrolyze nucleic acid phosphodiester bonds. However, chemical
modifications of oligonucleotides can confer improved properties, and, e.g., can render
oligonucleotides more stable to nucleases.
        As oligonucleotides are polymers of subunits or monomers, many of the
modifications described below occur at a position which is repeated within an
oligonucleotide, e.g., a modification of a base, a sugar, a phosphate moiety, or the non
bridging oxygen of a phosphate moiety. It is not necessary for all positions in a given
oligonucleotide to be uniformly modified, and in fact more than one of the
aforementioned modifications may be incorporated in a single oligonucleotide or even at
a single nucleoside within an oligonucleotide.
        In some cases the modification will occur at all of the subject positions in the
oligonucleotide but in many, and in fact in most cases it will not. By way of example, a
                                              82

 WO 2010/054406                                                               PCT/US2009/063933
modification may only occur at a 3' or 5' terminal position, may only occur in the
internal region, may only occur in a terminal regions, e.g. at a position on a terminal
nucleotide or in the last 2, 3, 4, 5, or 10 nucleotides of an oligonucleotide. A
modification may occur in a double strand region, a single strand region, or in both. A
modification may occur only in the double strand region of a double-stranded
oligonucleotide or may only occur in a single strand region of a double-stranded
oligonucleotide. E.g., a phosphorothioate modification at a non-bridging oxygen position
may only occur at one or both termini, may only occur in a terminal regions, e.g., at a
position on a terminal nucleotide or in the last 2, 3, 4, 5, or 10 nucleotides of a strand, or
may occur in double strand and single strand regions, particularly at termini. The 5' end
or ends can be phosphorylated.
         A modification described herein may be the sole modification, or the sole type of
modification included on multiple nucleotides, or a modification can be combined with
one or more other modifications described herein. The modifications described herein can
also be combined onto an oligonucleotide, e.g. different nucleotides of an oligonucleotide
have different modifications described herein.
         In some embodiments it is particularly preferred, e.g., to enhance stability, to
include particular nucleobases in overhangs, or to include modified nucleotides or
nucleotide surrogates, in single strand overhangs, e.g., in a 5' or 3' overhang, or in both.
E.g., it can be desirable to include purine nucleotides in overhangs. In some
embodiments all or some of the bases in a 3' or 5' overhang will be modified, e.g., with a
modification described herein. Modifications can include, e.g., the use of modifications
at the 2' OH group of the ribose sugar, e.g., the use of deoxyribonucleotides, e.g.,
deoxythymidine, instead of ribonucleotides, and modifications in the phosphate group,
e.g., phosphothioate modifications. Overhangs need not be homologous with the target
sequence.
         Specific modifications are discussed in more detail below.
The Phosphate Group
         The phosphate group is a negatively charged species. The charge is distributed
equally over the two non-bridging oxygen atoms. However, the phosphate group can be
modified by replacing one of the oxygens with a different substituent. One result of this
                                                83

  WO 2010/054406                                                             PCT/US2009/063933
modification to RNA phosphate backbones can be increased resistance of the
oligoribonucleotide to nucleolytic breakdown. Thus while not wishing to be bound by
theory, it can be desirable in some embodiments to introduce alterations which result in
either an uncharged linker or a charged linker with unsymmetrical charge distribution.
         Examples of modified phosphate groups include phosphorothioate,
phosphoroselenates, borano phosphates, borano phosphate esters, hydrogen phosphonates,
phosphoroamidates, alkyl or aryl phosphonates and phosphotriesters. In certain
embodiments, one of the non-bridging phosphate oxygen atoms in the phosphate
backbone moiety can be replaced by any of the following: S, Se, BR 3 (R is hydrogen,
alkyl, aryl), C (i.e. an alkyl group, an aryl group, etc...), H, NR2 (R is hydrogen, alkyl,
aryl), or OR (R is alkyl or aryl). The phosphorous atom in an unmodified phosphate
group is achiral. However, replacement of one of the non-bridging oxygens with one of
the above atoms or groups of atoms renders the phosphorous atom chiral; in other words
a phosphorous atom in a phosphate group modified in this way is a stereogenic center.
The stereogenic phosphorous atom can possess either the "R" configuration (herein Rp)
or the "S" configuration (herein Sp).
         Phosphorodithioates have both non-bridging oxygens replaced by sulfur. The
phosphorus center in the phosphorodithioates is achiral which precludes the formation of
oligoribonucleotides diastereomers. Thus, while not wishing to be bound by theory,
modifications to both non-bridging oxygens, which eliminate the chiral center, e.g.
phosphorodithioate formation, may be desirable in that they cannot produce diastereomer
mixtures. Thus, the non-bridging oxygens can be independently any one of S, Se, B, C,
H, N, or OR (R is alkyl or aryl).
         The phosphate linker can also be modified by replacement of bridging oxygen,
(i.e. oxgen that links the phosphate to the nucleoside), with nitrogen (bridged
phosphoroamidates), sulfur (bridged phosphorothioates) and carbon (bridged
methylenephosphonates). The replacement can occur at the either linking oxygen or at
both the linking oxygens. When the bridging oxygen is the 3'-oxygen of a nucleoside,
replcament with carbobn is preferred. When the bridging oxygen is the 5'-oxygen of a
nucleoside, replcament with nitrogen is preferred.
                                                84

 WO 2010/054406                                                            PCT/US2009/063933
Replacement of the Phosphate Group
         The phosphate group can be replaced by non-phosphorus containing connectors.
While not wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that since the charged
phosphodiester group is the reaction center in nucleolytic degradation, its replacement
with neutral structural mimics should impart enhanced nuclease stability. Again, while
not wishing to be bound by theory, it can be desirable, in some embodiment, to introduce
alterations in which the charged phosphate group is replaced by a neutral moiety.
         Examples of moieties which can replace the phosphate group include methyl
phosphonate, hydroxylamino, siloxane, carbonate, carboxymethyl, carbamate, amide,
thioether, ethylene oxide linker, sulfonate, sulfonamide, thioformacetal, formacetal,
oxime, methyleneimino, methylenemethylimino, methylenehydrazo,
methylenedimethylhydrazo and methyleneoxymethylimino. Preferred replacements
include the methylenecarbonylamino and methylenemethylimino groups.
         Modified phosphate linkages where at least one of the oxygens linked to the
phosphate has been replaced or the phosphate group has been replaced by a non
phosphorous group, are also referred to as "non phosphodiester backbone linkage."
Replacement of Ribophosphate Backbone
         Oligonucleotide- mimicking scaffolds can also be constructed wherein the
phosphate linker and ribose sugar are replaced by nuclease resistant nucleoside or
nucleotide surrogates. While not wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that the
absence of a repetitively charged backbone diminishes binding to proteins that recognize
polyanions (e.g. nucleases). Again, while not wishing to be bound by theory, it can be
desirable in some embodiment, to introduce alterations in which the bases are tethered by
a neutral surrogate backbone. Examples include the mophilino, cyclobutyl, pyrrolidine
and peptide nucleic acid (PNA) nucleoside surrogates. A preferred surrogate is a PNA
surrogate.
Suzar modifications
         A modified RNA can include modification of all or some of the sugar groups of
the ribonucleic acid. E.g., the 2' hydroxyl group (OH) can be modified or replaced with a
number of different "oxy" or "deoxy" substituents. While not being bound by theory,
enhanced stability is expected since the hydroxyl can no longer be deprotonated to form a
                                              85

 WO 2010/054406                                                                PCT/US2009/063933
2'-alkoxide ion. The 2'-alkoxide can catalyze degradation by intramolecular nucleophilic
attack on the linker phosphorus atom. Again, while not wishing to be bound by theory, it
can be desirable to some embodiments to introduce alterations in which alkoxide
formation at the 2' position is not possible.
        Examples of "oxy"-2' hydroxyl group modifications include alkoxy or aryloxy
(OR, e.g., R = H, alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, aralkyl, heteroaryl or sugar);
polyethyleneglycols (PEG), O(CH 2CH 2O), 1CH 2CH 2 OR; "locked" nucleic acids (LNA) in
which the 2' hydroxyl is connected, e.g., by a methylene bridge, to the 4' carbon of the
same ribose sugar; O-AMINE (AMINE          =  NH 2 ; alkylamino, dialkylamino, heterocyclyl,
arylamino, diaryl amino, heteroaryl amino, or diheteroaryl amino, ethylene diamine,
polyamino) and aminoalkoxy, O(CH 2)nAMINE, (e.g., AMINE             = NH 2 ; alkylamino,
dialkylamino, heterocyclyl, arylamino, diaryl amino, heteroaryl amino, or diheteroaryl
amino, ethylene diamine, polyamino). It is noteworthy that oligonucleotides containing
only the methoxyethyl group (MOE), (OCH 2CH 20CH3, a PEG derivative), exhibit
nuclease stabilities comparable to those modified with the robust phosphorothioate
modification.
        "Deoxy" modifications include hydrogen (i.e. deoxyribose sugars, which are of
particular relevance to the overhang portions of partially ds RNA); halo (e.g., fluoro);
amino (e.g. NH 2; alkylamino, dialkylamino, heterocyclyl, arylamino, diaryl amino,
heteroaryl amino, diheteroaryl amino, or amino acid); NH(CH 2 CH 2NH) 1 CH 2CH 2
AMINE (AMINE        =  NH 2 ; alkylamino, dialkylamino, heterocyclyl, arylamino, diaryl
amino, heteroaryl amino,or diheteroaryl amino), -NHC(O)R (R = alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl,
aralkyl, heteroaryl or sugar), cyano; mercapto; alkyl-thio-alkyl; thioalkoxy; and alkyl,
cycloalkyl, aryl, alkenyl and alkynyl, which may be optionally substituted with e.g., an
amino functionality. Preferred substitutents are 2'-methoxyethyl, 2'-OCH3, 2'-O-allyl,
2'-C- allyl, and 2'-fluoro.
        The sugar group can also contain one or more carbons that possess the opposite
stereochemical configuration than that of the corresponding carbon in ribose. Thus, an
oligonucleotide can include nucleotides containing e.g., arabinose, as the sugar. The
monomer can have an alpha linkage at the 1' position on the sugar, e.g., alpha
nucleosides. Oligonucleotides can also include "abasic" sugars, which lack a nucleobase
                                               86

 WO 2010/054406                                                             PCT/US2009/063933
at C-i'. These abasic sugars can also be further containing modifications at one or more
of the constituent sugar atoms. Oligonucleotides can also contain one or more sugars that
are in the L form, e.g. L-nucleosides.
Terminal Modifications
         The 3' and 5' ends of an oligonucleotide can be modified. Such modifications can
be at the 3' end, 5' end or both ends of the molecule. They can include modification or
replacement of an entire terminal phosphate or of one or more of the atoms of the
phosphate group. E.g., the 3' and 5' ends of an oligonucleotide can be conjugated to
other functional molecular entities such as labeling moieties, e.g., fluorophores (e.g.,
pyrene, TAMRA, fluorescein, Cy3 or Cy5 dyes) or protecting groups (based e.g., on
sulfur, silicon, boron or ester). The functional molecular entities can be attached to the
sugar through a phosphate group and/or a linker. The terminal atom of the linker can
connect to or replace the linking atom of the phosphate group or the C-3' or C-5' 0, N, S
or C group of the sugar. Alternatively, the linker can connect to or replace the terminal
atom of a nucleotide surrogate (e.g., PNAs).
         When a linker/phosphate-functional molecular entity-linker/phosphate array is
interposed between two strands of a dsRNA, this array can substitute for a hairpin RNA
loop in a hairpin-type RNA agent.
         Terminal modifications useful for modulating activity include modification of the
5' end with phosphate or phosphate analogs. E.g., in preferred embodiments antisense
strands of dsRNAs, are 5' phosphorylated or include a phosphoryl analog at the 5' prime
terminus. 5'-phosphate modifications include those which are compatible with RISC
mediated gene silencing. Suitable modifications include: 5'-monophosphate
((HO)2(O)P-0-5'); 5'-diphosphate ((HO)2(O)P-0-P(HO)(O)-0-5'); 5'-triphosphate
((HO)2(O)P-O-(HO)(O)P-0-P(HO)(O)-0-5'); 5'-guanosine cap (7-methylated or non
methylated) (7m-G-0-5'-(HO)(O)P-O-(HO)(O)P-0-P(HO)(O)-0-5'); 5'-adenosine cap
(Appp), and any modified or unmodified nucleotide cap structure (N-0-5'-(HO)(O)P-0
(HO)(O)P-0-P(HO)(O)-0-5'); 5'-monothiophosphate (phosphorothioate; (HO)2(S)P-0
5'); 5'-monodithiophosphate (phosphorodithioate; (HO)(HS)(S)P-0-5'), 5'
phosphorothiolate ((HO)2(0)P-S-5'); any additional combination of oxgen/sulfur
replaced monophosphate, diphosphate and triphosphates (e.g. 5'-alpha-thiotriphosphate,
                                              87

 WO 2010/054406                                                            PCT/US2009/063933
5'-gamma-thiotriphosphate, etc.), 5'-phosphoramidates ((HO)2(O)P-NH-5',
(HO)(NH2)(O)P-0-5'), 5'-alkylphosphonates (R=alkyl=methyl, ethyl, isopropyl, propyl,
etc., e.g. RP(OH)(O)-0-5'-, (OH)2(O)P-5'-CH2-), 5'-alkyletherphosphonates
(R=alkylether=methoxymethyl (MeOCH2-), ethoxymethyl, etc., e.g. RP(OH)(O)-0-5'-).
         Terminal modifications can also be useful for monitoring distribution, and in such
cases the preferred groups to be added include fluorophores, e.g., fluorscein or an Alexa
dye, e.g., Alexa 488. Terminal modifications can also be useful for enhancing uptake,
useful modifications for this include cholesterol. Terminal modifications can also be
useful for cross-linking an RNA agent to another moiety; modifications useful for this
include mitomycin C.
Nucleobases
         Adenine, guanine, cytosine and uracil are the most common bases found in RNA.
These bases can be modified or replaced to provide RNA's having improved properties.
E.g., nuclease resistant oligoribonucleotides can be prepared with these bases or with
synthetic and natural nucleobases (e.g., inosine, thymine, xanthine, hypoxanthine,
nubularine, isoguanisine, or tubercidine) and any one of the above modifications.
Alternatively, substituted or modified analogs of any of the above bases, e.g., "unusual
bases", "modified bases", "non-natual bases" and "universal bases" described herein, can
be employed. Examples include without limitation 2-aminoadenine, 6-methyl and other
alkyl derivatives of adenine and guanine, 2-propyl and other alkyl derivatives of adenine
and guanine, 5-halouracil and cytosine, 5-propynyl uracil and cytosine, 6-azo uracil,
cytosine and thymine, 5-uracil (pseudouracil), 4-thiouracil, 5-halouracil, 5-(2
aminopropyl)uracil, 5-amino allyl uracil, 8-halo, amino, thiol, thioalkyl, hydroxyl and
other 8-substituted adenines and guanines, 5-trifluoromethyl and other 5-substituted
uracils and cytosines, 7-methylguanine, 5-substituted pyrimidines, 6-azapyrimidines and
N-2, N-6 and 0-6 substituted purines, including 2-aminopropyladenine, 5-propynyluracil
and 5 -propynylcytosine, dihydrouracil, 3 -deaza-5-azacytosine, 2-aminopurine, 5

Engineering, pages 858-859, Kroschwitz, J. I., ed. John Wiley & Sons, 1990, and those
disclosed by Englisch et al., Angewandte Chemie, International Edition, 1991, 30, 613.
Cationic Groups
        Modifications to oligonucleotides can also include attachment of one or more
cationic groups to the sugar, base, and/or the phosphorus atom of a phosphate or modified
phosphate backbone moiety. A cationic group can be attached to any atom capable of
substitution on a natural, unusual or universal base. A preferred position is one that does
not interfere with hybridization, i.e., does not interfere with the hydrogen bonding
interactions needed for base pairing. A cationic group can be attached e.g., through the
C2' position of a sugar or analogous position in a cyclic or acyclic sugar surrogate.
Cationic groups can include e.g., protonated amino groups, derived from e.g., O-AMINE
(AMINE     = NH 2 ; alkylamino, dialkylamino, heterocyclyl, arylamino, diaryl amino,
heteroaryl amino, or diheteroaryl amino, ethylene diamine, polyamino); aminoalkoxy,
e.g., O(CH 2)n1AMINE, (e.g., AMINE       = NH 2; alkylamino, dialkylamino, heterocyclyl,
arylamino, diaryl amino, heteroaryl amino, or diheteroaryl amino, ethylene diamine,
polyamino); amino (e.g. NH 2 ; alkylamino, dialkylamino, heterocyclyl, arylamino, diaryl
amino, heteroaryl amino, diheteroaryl amino, or amino acid); or
NH(CH 2CH 2NH) 1 CH 2CH 2-AMINE (AMINE             = NH 2 ; alkylamino, dialkylamino,
heterocyclyl, arylamino, diaryl amino, heteroaryl amino,or diheteroaryl amino).
Placement within an oligonucleotide
        Some modifications may preferably be included on an oligonucleotide at a
particular location, e.g., at an internal position of a strand, or on the 5' or 3' end of an
oligonucleotide. A preferred location of a modification on an oligonucleotide, may
confer preferred properties on the agent. For example, preferred locations of particular

modifications may confer optimum gene silencing properties, or increased resistance to
endonuclease or exonuclease activity.
        One or more nucleotides of an oligonucleotide may have a 2'-5' linkage. One or
more nucleotides of an oligonucleotide may have inverted linkages, e.g. 3'-3', 5'-5', 2'
2' or 2'-3' linkages.
        A double-stranded oligonucleotide may include at least one 5'-uridine-adenine-3'
(5'-UA-3') dinucleotide wherein the uridine is a 2'-modified nucleotide, or a terminal 5'
uridine-guanine-3' (5'-UG-3') dinucleotide, wherein the 5'-uridine is a 2'-modified
nucleotide, or a terminal 5'-cytidine-adenine-3' (5'-CA-3') dinucleotide, wherein the 5'
cytidine is a 2'-modified nucleotide, or a terminal 5'-uridine-uridine-3' (5'-UU-3')
dinucleotide, wherein the 5'-uridine is a 2'-modified nucleotide, or a terminal 5'
cytidine-cytidine-3' (5'-CC-3') dinucleotide, wherein the 5'-cytidine is a 2'-modified
nucleotide, or a terminal 5'-cytidine-uridine-3' (5'-CU-3') dinucleotide, wherein the 5'
cytidine is a 2'-modified nucleotide, or a terminal 5'-uridine-cytidine-3' (5'-UC-3')
dinucleotide, wherein the 5'-uridine is a 2'-modified nucleotide. Double-stranded
oligonucleotides including these modifications are particularly stabilized against
endonuclease activity.

        In one embodiment, the linker comprises at least one cleavable linking group.
        In certain embodiments, the linker is a branched linker. The branchpoint of the
branched linker may be at least trivalent, but may be a tetravalent, pentavalent or
hexavalent atom, or a group presenting such multiple valencies. In certain embodiments,
the branchpoint is , -N, -N(Q)-C, -0-C, -S-C, -SS-C, -C(O)N(Q)-C, -OC(O)N(Q)-C,

Cleavable Linking Groups
        A cleavable linking group is one which is sufficiently stable outside the cell, but
which upon entry into a target cell is cleaved to release the two parts the linker is holding
together. In a preferred embodiment, the cleavable linking group is cleaved at least 10
times or more, preferably at least 100 times faster in the target cell or under a first
reference condition (which can, e.g., be selected to mimic or represent intracellular
conditions) than in the blood of a subject, or under a second reference condition (which
can, e.g., be selected to mimic or represent conditions found in the blood or serum).
Cleavable linking groups are susceptible to cleavage agents, e.g., pH, redox potential or
the presence of degradative molecules. Generally, cleavage agents are more prevalent or
found at higher levels or activities inside cells than in serum or blood. Examples of such
degradative agents include: redox agents which are selected for particular substrates or
which have no substrate specificity, including, e.g., oxidative or reductive enzymes or
reductive agents such as mercaptans, present in cells, that can degrade a redox cleavable
linking group by reduction; esterases; endosomes or agents that can create an acidic
environment, e.g., those that result in a pH of five or lower; enzymes that can hydrolyze
or degrade an acid cleavable linking group by acting as a general acid, peptidases (which
can be substrate specific), and phosphatases.
        A cleavable linkage group, such as a disulfide bond can be susceptible to pH. The
pH of human serum is 7.4, while the average intracellular pH is slightly lower, ranging
from about 7.1-7.3. Endosomes have a more acidic pH, in the range of 5.5-6.0, and
lysosomes have an even more acidic pH at around 5.0. Some linkers will have a
                                              95

  WO 2010/054406                                                              PCT/US2009/063933
cleavable linking group that is cleaved at a preferred pH, thereby releasing the cationic
lipid from the ligand inside the cell, or into the desired compartment of the cell.
         A linker can include a cleavable linking group that is cleavable by a particular
enzyme. The type of cleavable linking group incorporated into a linker can depend on
the cell to be targeted. For example, liver targeting ligands can be linked to the cationic
lipids through a linker that includes an ester group. Liver cells are rich in esterases, and
therefore the linker will be cleaved more efficiently in liver cells than in cell types that
are not esterase-rich. Other cell-types rich in esterases include cells of the lung, renal
cortex, and testis.
         Linkers that contain peptide bonds can be used when targeting cell types rich in
peptidases, such as liver cells and synoviocytes.
         In general, the suitability of a candidate cleavable linking group can be evaluated
by testing the ability of a degradative agent (or condition) to cleave the candidate linking
group. It will also be desirable to also test the candidate cleavable linking group for the
ability to resist cleavage in the blood or when in contact with other non-target tissue.
Thus one can determine the relative susceptibility to cleavage between a first and a
second condition, where the first is selected to be indicative of cleavage in a target cell
and the second is selected to be indicative of cleavage in other tissues or biological fluids,
e.g., blood or serum. The evaluations can be carried out in cell free systems, in cells, in
cell culture, in organ or tissue culture, or in whole animals. It may be useful to make
initial evaluations in cell-free or culture conditions and to confirm by further evaluations
in whole animals. In preferred embodiments, useful candidate compounds are cleaved at
least 2, 4, 10 or 100 times faster in the cell (or under in vitro conditions selected to mimic
intracellular conditions) as compared to blood or serum (or under in vitro conditions
selected to mimic extracellular conditions).
Redox cleavable linking groups
         One class of cleavable linking groups are redox cleavable linking groups that are
cleaved upon reduction or oxidation. An example of reductively cleavable linking group
is a disulphide linking group (-S-S-). To determine if a candidate cleavable linking group
is a suitable "reductively cleavable linking group," or for example is suitable for use with
a particular iRNA moiety and particular targeting agent one can look to methods
                                                96

 WO 2010/054406                                                               PCT/US2009/063933
described herein. For example, a candidate can be evaluated by incubation with
dithiothreitol (DTT), or other reducing agent using reagents know in the art, which mimic
the rate of cleavage which would be observed in a cell, e.g., a target cell. The candidates
can also be evaluated under conditions which are selected to mimic blood or serum
conditions. In a preferred embodiment, candidate compounds are cleaved by at most
10% in the blood. In preferred embodiments, useful candidate compounds are degraded
at least 2, 4, 10 or 100 times faster in the cell (or under in vitro conditions selected to
mimic intracellular conditions) as compared to blood (or under in vitro conditions
selected to mimic extracellular conditions). The rate of cleavage of candidate compounds
can be determined using standard enzyme kinetics assays under conditions chosen to
mimic intracellular media and compared to conditions chosen to mimic extracellular
media.
Phosphate-basedcleavable linking groups
         Phosphate-based cleavable linking groups are cleaved by agents that degrade or
hydrolyze the phosphate group. An example of an agent that cleaves phosphate groups in
cells are enzymes such as phosphatases in cells. Examples of phosphate-based linking
groups are -O-P(O)(ORk)-O-, -O-P(S)(ORk)-O-, -O-P(S)(SRk)-O-, -S-P(O)(ORk)-O-,
O-P(O)(ORk)-S-, -S-P(O)(ORk)-S-, -O-P(S)(ORk)-S-, -S-P(S)(ORk)-O-, -O-P(O)(Rk)

P(O)(OH)-0-, -0-P(O)(OH)-S-, -S-P(O)(OH)-S-, -0-P(S)(OH)-S-, -S-P(S)(OH)-0-, -0

S-. A preferred embodiment is -0-P(O)(OH)-0-. These candidates can be evaluated
using methods analogous to those described above.
Acid cleavable linking groups
         Acid cleavable linking groups are linking groups that are cleaved under acidic
conditions. In preferred embodiments acid cleavable linking groups are cleaved in an
acidic environment with a pH of about 6.5 or lower (e.g., about 6.0, 5.5, 5.0, or lower), or
by agents such as enzymes that can act as a general acid. In a cell, specific low pH
organelles, such as endosomes and lysosomes can provide a cleaving environment for
                                               97

  WO 2010/054406                                                           PCT/US2009/063933
acid cleavable linking groups. Examples of acid cleavable linking groups include but are
not limited to hydrazones, esters, and esters of amino acids. Acid cleavable groups can
have the general formula -C=NN-, C(O)O, or -OC(O). A preferred embodiment is when
the carbon attached to the oxygen of the ester (the alkoxy group) is an aryl group,
substituted alkyl group, or tertiary alkyl group such as dimethyl pentyl or t-butyl. These
candidates can be evaluated using methods analogous to those described above.
Ester-based linking groups
        Ester-based cleavable linking groups are cleaved by enzymes such as esterases
and amidases in cells. Examples of ester-based cleavable linking groups include but are
not limited to esters of alkylene, alkenylene and alkynylene groups. Ester cleavable
linking groups have the general formula -C(O)O-, or -OC(O)-. These candidates can be
evaluated using methods analogous to those described above.
Peptide-basedcleaving groups
        Peptide-based cleavable linking groups are cleaved by enzymes such as
peptidases and proteases in cells. Peptide-based cleavable linking groups are peptide
bonds formed between amino acids to yield oligopeptides (e.g., dipeptides, tripeptides
etc.) and polypeptides. Peptide-based cleavable groups do not include the amide group (
C(O)NH-). The amide group can be formed between any alkylene, alkenylene or
alkynelene. A peptide bond is a special type of amide bond formed between amino acids
to yield peptides and proteins. The peptide based cleavage group is generally limited to
the peptide bond (i.e., the amide bond) formed between amino acids yielding peptides
and proteins and does not include the entire amide functional group. Peptide-based
cleavable linking groups have the general formula - NHCHRAC(O)NHCHRBC(O)-,
where RA and RB are the R groups of the two adjacent amino acids. These candidates can
be evaluated using methods analogous to those described above.
Ligands
        A wide variety of entities can be coupled to the oligonucleotides and lipids of the
present invention. Preferred moieties are ligands, which are coupled, preferably
covalently, either directly or indirectly via an intervening tether.
                                               98

  WO 2010/054406                                                              PCT/US2009/063933
         In preferred embodiments, a ligand alters the distribution, targeting or lifetime of
the molecule into which it is incorporated. In preferred embodiments a ligand provides
an enhanced affinity for a selected target, e.g., molecule, cell or cell type, compartment,
e.g., a cellular or organ compartment, tissue, organ or region of the body, as, e.g.,
compared to a species absent such a ligand. Ligands providing enhanced affinity for a
selected target are also termed targeting ligands. Preferred ligands for conjugation to the
lipids of the present invention are targeting ligands.
         Some ligands can have endosomolytic properties. The endosomolytic ligands
promote the lysis of the endosome and/or transport of the composition of the invention,
or its components, from the endosome to the cytoplasm of the cell. The endosomolytic
ligand may be a polyanionic peptide or peptidomimetic which shows pH-dependent
membrane activity and fusogenicity. In certain embodiments, the endosomolytic ligand
assumes its active conformation at endosomal pH. The "active" conformation is that
conformation in which the endosomolytic ligand promotes lysis of the endosome and/or
transport of the composition of the invention, or its components, from the endosome to
the cytoplasm of the cell. Exemplary endosomolytic ligands include the GALA peptide
(Subbarao et al., Biochemistry, 1987, 26: 2964-2972), the EALA peptide (Vogel et al., J.
Am. Chem. Soc., 1996, 118: 1581-1586), and their derivatives (Turk et al., Biochem.
Biophys. Acta, 2002, 1559: 56-68). In certain embodiments, the endosomolytic
component may contain a chemical group (e.g., an amino acid) which will undergo a
change in charge or protonation in response to a change in pH. The endosomolytic
component may be linear or branched. Exemplary primary sequences of peptide based
endosomolytic ligands are shown in Table 4.

         Ligands can be proteins, e.g., glycoproteins, or peptides, e.g., molecules having a
specific affinity for a co-ligand, or antibodies e.g., an antibody, that binds to a specified
cell type such as a cancer cell, endothelial cell, or bone cell. Ligands may also include
hormones and hormone receptors. They can also include non-peptidic species, such as
lipids, lectins, carbohydrates, vitamins, cofactors, multivalent lactose, multivalent
galactose, N-acetyl-galactosamine, N-acetyl-gulucosamine multivalent mannose,
multivalent fucose, or aptamers. The ligand can be, for example, a lipopolysaccharide, an
activator of p38 MAP kinase, or an activator of NF-KB.
         The ligand can be a substance, e.g, a drug, which can increase the uptake of the
iRNA agent into the cell, for example, by disrupting the cell's cytoskeleton, e.g., by
disrupting the cell's microtubules, microfilaments, and/or intermediate filaments. The
drug can be, for example, taxon, vincristine, vinblastine, cytochalasin, nocodazole,
japlakinolide, latrunculin A, phalloidin, swinholide A, indanocine, or myoservin.
         The ligand can increase the uptake of the iRNA agent into the cell by activating
an inflammatory response, for example. Exemplary ligands that would have such an
effect include tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha), interleukin-1 beta, or gamma
interferon.
         In one aspect, the ligand is a lipid or lipid-based molecule. Such a lipid or lipid
based molecule preferably binds a serum protein, e.g., human serum albumin (HSA). An
HSA binding ligand allows for distribution of the conjugate to a target tissue, e.g., a non
kidney target tissue of the body. For example, the target tissue can be the liver, including
parenchymal cells of the liver. Other molecules that can bind HSA can also be used as
ligands. For example, neproxin or aspirin can be used. A lipid or lipid-based ligand can
(a) increase resistance to degradation of the conjugate, (b) increase targeting or transport
into a target cell or cell membrane, and/or (c) can be used to adjust binding to a serum
protein, e.g., HSA.
         A lipid based ligand can be used to modulate, e.g., control the binding of the
conjugate to a target tissue. For example, a lipid or lipid-based ligand that binds to HSA
more strongly will be less likely to be targeted to the kidney and therefore less likely to
                                               103

  WO 2010/054406                                                               PCT/US2009/063933
be cleared from the body. A lipid or lipid-based ligand that binds to HSA less strongly
can be used to target the conjugate to the kidney.
         In a preferred embodiment, the lipid based ligand binds HSA. Preferably, it binds
HSA with a sufficient affinity such that the conjugate will be preferably distributed to a
non-kidney tissue. However, it is preferred that the affinity not be so strong that the
HSA-ligand binding cannot be reversed.
         In another preferred embodiment, the lipid based ligand binds HSA weakly or not
at all, such that the conjugate will be preferably distributed to the kidney. Other moieties
that target to kidney cells can also be used in place of or in addition to the lipid based
ligand.
         In another aspect, the ligand is a moiety, e.g., a vitamin, which is taken up by a
target cell, e.g., a proliferating cell. These are particularly useful for treating disorders
characterized by unwanted cell proliferation, e.g., of the malignant or non-malignant
type, e.g., cancer cells. Exemplary vitamins include vitamin A, E, and K. Other
exemplary vitamins include are B vitamin, e.g., folic acid, B12, riboflavin, biotin,
pyridoxal or other vitamins or nutrients taken up by cancer cells. Also included are HAS,
low density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL).
         In another aspect, the ligand is a cell-permeation agent, preferably a helical cell
permeation agent. Preferably, the agent is amphipathic. An exemplary agent is a peptide
such as tat or antennopedia. If the agent is a peptide, it can be modified, including a
peptidylmimetic, invertomers, non-peptide or pseudo-peptide linkages, and use of D
amino acids. The helical agent is preferably an alpha-helical agent, which preferably has
a lipophilic and a lipophobic phase.
         The ligand can be a peptide or peptidomimetic. A peptidomimetic (also referred
to herein as an oligopeptidomimetic) is a molecule capable of folding into a defined
three-dimensional structure similar to a natural peptide. The peptide or peptidomimetic
moiety can be about 5-50 amino acids long, e.g., about 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, or
50 amino acids long (see Table 6, for example).

         A peptide or peptidomimetic can be, for example, a cell permeation peptide,
cationic peptide, amphipathic peptide, or hydrophobic peptide (e.g., consisting primarily
of Tyr, Trp or Phe). The peptide moiety can be a dendrimer peptide, constrained peptide
or crosslinked peptide. In another alternative, the peptide moiety can include a

  WO 2010/054406                                                             PCT/US2009/063933
hydrophobic membrane translocation sequence (MTS). An exemplary hydrophobic
MTS-containing peptide is RFGF having the amino acid sequence
AAVALLPAVLLALLAP. An RFGF analogue (e.g., amino acid sequence
AALLPVLLAAP) containing a hydrophobic MTS can also be a targeting moiety. The
peptide moiety can be a "delivery" peptide, which can carry large polar molecules
including peptides, oligonucleotides, and protein across cell membranes. For example,
sequences from the HIV Tat protein (GRKKRRQRRRPPQ) and the Drosophila
Antennapedia protein (RQIKIWFQNRRMKWKK) have been found to be capable of
functioning as delivery peptides. A peptide or peptidomimetic can be encoded by a
random sequence of DNA, such as a peptide identified from a phage-display library, or
one-bead-one-compound (OBOC) combinatorial library (Lam et al., Nature, 354:82-84,
1991). Preferably the peptide or peptidomimetic tethered to an iRNA agent via an
incorporated monomer unit is a cell targeting peptide such as an arginine-glycine-aspartic
acid (RGD)-peptide, or RGD mimic. A peptide moiety can range in length from about 5
amino acids to about 40 amino acids. The peptide moieties can have a structural
modification, such as to increase stability or direct conformational properties. Any of the
structural modifications described below can be utilized.
        An RGD peptide moiety can be used to target a tumor cell, such as an endothelial
tumor cell or a breast cancer tumor cell (Zitzmann et al., Cancer Res., 62:5139-43, 2002).
An RGD peptide can facilitate targeting of an iRNA agent to tumors of a variety of other
tissues, including the lung, kidney, spleen, or liver (Aoki et al., Cancer Gene Therapy
8:783-787, 2001). Preferably, the RGD peptide will facilitate targeting of an iRNA agent
to the kidney. The RGD peptide can be linear or cyclic, and can be modified, e.g.,
glycosylated or methylated to facilitate targeting to specific tissues. For example, a
glycosylated RGD peptide can deliver an iRNA agent to a tumor cell expressing avB3
(Haubner et al., Jour. Nucl. Med., 42:326-336, 2001).
         Peptides that target markers enriched in proliferating cells can be used. E.g.,
RGD containing peptides and peptidomimetics can target cancer cells, in particular cells
that exhibit an avp3 integrin. Thus, one could use RGD peptides, cyclic peptides
containing RGD, RGD peptides that include D-amino acids, as well as synthetic RGD
mimics. In addition to RGD, one can use other moieties that target the avp3 integrin
                                             106

  WO 2010/054406                                                            PCT/US2009/063933
ligand. Generally, such ligands can be used to control proliferating cells and angiogeneis.
Preferred conjugates of this type lignads that targets PECAM-1, VEGF, or other cancer
gene, e.g., a cancer gene described herein.
         A "cell permeation peptide" is capable of permeating a cell, e.g., a microbial cell,
such as a bacterial or fungal cell, or a mammalian cell, such as a human cell. A microbial
cell-permeating peptide can be, for example, an a-helical linear peptide (e.g., LL-37 or
Ceropin P1), a disulfide bond-containing peptide (e.g., a -defensin,   p-defensin or
bactenecin), or a peptide containing only one or two dominating amino acids (e.g., PR-39
or indolicidin). A cell permeation peptide can also include a nuclear localization signal
(NLS). For example, a cell permeation peptide can be a bipartite amphipathic peptide,
such as MPG, which is derived from the fusion peptide domain of HIV- 1 gp41 and the
NLS of SV40 large T antigen (Simeoni et al., Nucl. Acids Res. 31:2717-2724, 2003).
         In one embodiment, a targeting peptide tethered to an iRNA agent and/or the
carrier oligomer can be an amphipathic a-helical peptide. Exemplary amphipathic a
helical peptides include, but are not limited to, cecropins, lycotoxins, paradaxins, buforin,
CPF, bombinin-like peptide (BLP), cathelicidins, ceratotoxins, S. clava peptides, hagfish
intestinal antimicrobial peptides (HFIAPs), magainines, brevinins-2, dermaseptins,
melittins, pleurocidin, H 2A peptides, Xenopus peptides, esculentinis-1, and caerins. A
number of factors will preferably be considered to maintain the integrity of helix stability.
For example, a maximum number of helix stabilization residues will be utilized (e.g., leu,
ala, or lys), and a minimum number helix destabilization residues will be utilized (e.g.,
proline, or cyclic monomeric units. The capping residue will be considered (for example
Gly is an exemplary N-capping residue and/or C-terminal amidation can be used to
provide an extra H-bond to stabilize the helix. Formation of salt bridges between
residues with opposite charges, separated by i + 3, or i + 4 positions can provide stability.
For example, cationic residues such as lysine, arginine, homo-arginine, ornithine or
histidine can form salt bridges with the anionic residues glutamate or aspartate.
         Peptide and peptidomimetic ligands include those having naturally occurring or
modified peptides, e.g., D or L peptides; a, $, or y peptides; N-methyl peptides;
azapeptides; peptides having one or more amide, i.e., peptide, linkages replaced with one
or more urea, thiourea, carbamate, or sulfonyl urea linkages; or cyclic peptides.

         The targeting ligand can be any ligand that is capable of targeting a specific
receptor. Examples are: folate, GalNAc, galactose, mannose, mannose-6P, clusters of
sugars such as GalNAc cluster, mannose cluster, galactose cluster, or an apatamer. A
cluster is a combination of two or more sugar units. The targeting ligands also include
integrin receptor ligands, Chemokine receptor ligands, transferrin, biotin, serotonin
receptor ligands, PSMA, endothelin, GCPII, somatostatin, LDL and HDL ligands. The
ligands can also be based on nucleic acid, e.g., an aptamer. The aptamer can be
unmodified or have any combination of modifications disclosed herein.
         Endosomal release agents include imidazoles, poly or oligoimidazoles, PEls,
peptides, fusogenic peptides, polycaboxylates, polyacations, masked oligo or poly cations
or anions, acetals, polyacetals, ketals/polyketyals, orthoesters, polymers with masked or
unmasked cationic or anionic charges, dendrimers with masked or unmasked cationic or
anionic charges.
         PK modulator stands for pharmacokinetic modulator. PK modulator include
lipophiles, bile acids, steroids, phospholipid analogues, peptides, protein binding agents,
PEG, vitamins etc. Examplary PK modulator include, but are not limited to, cholesterol,
fatty acids, cholic acid, lithocholic acid, dialkylglycerides, diacylglyceride, phospholipids,
sphingolipids, naproxen, ibuprofen, vitamin E, biotin etc. Oligonucleotides that comprise
a number of phosphorothioate linkages are also known to bind to serum protein, thus
short oligonucleotides, e.g. oligonucleotides of about 5 bases, 10 bases, 15 bases or 20
bases, comprising multiple of phosphorothioate linkages in the backbaone are also
amenable to the present invention as ligands (e.g. as PK modulating ligands).
         In addition, aptamers that bind serum components (e.g. serum proteins) are also
amenable to the present invention as PK modulating ligands.
         Other ligands amenable to the invention are described in copending applications

different properties. For example, a ligand can have targeting properties, have
endosomolytic activity or have PK modulating properties. In a preferred embodiment, all
the ligands have different properties.
        Ligands can be coupled to the oligonucleotides various places, for example, 3'
end, 5'-end, and/or at an internal position. In preferred embodiments, the ligand is
attached to the oligonucleotides via an intervening tether. The ligand or tethered ligand
may be present on a monomer when said monomer is incorporated into the growing
strand. In some embodiments, the ligand may be incorporated via coupling to a
"precursor" monomer after said "precursor" monomer has been incorporated into the
growing strand. For example, a monomer having, e.g., an amino-terminated tether (i.e.,
having no associated ligand), e.g., TAP-(CH 2)n1 NH 2 may be incorporated into a growing
sense or antisense strand. In a subsequent operation, i.e., after incorporation of the
precursor monomer into the strand, a ligand having an electrophilic group, e.g., a
pentafluorophenyl ester or aldehyde group, can subsequently be attached to the precursor
monomer by coupling the electrophilic group of the ligand with the terminal nucleophilic
group of the precursor monomer's tether.
        For double- stranded oligonucleotides, ligands can be attached to one or both
strands. In some embodiments, a double-stranded iRNA agent contains a ligand
conjugated to the sense strand. In other embodiments, a double-stranded iRNA agent
contains a ligand conjugated to the antisense strand.
        In some embodiments, lignad can be conjugated to nucleobases, sugar moieties,
or internucleosidic linkages of nucleic acid molecules. Conjugation to purine nucleobases
or derivatives thereof can occur at any position including, endocyclic and exocyclic
atoms. In some embodiments, the 2-, 6-, 7-, or 8-positions of a purine nucleobase are
attached to a conjugate moiety. Conjugation to pyrimidine nucleobases or derivatives
thereof can also occur at any position. In some embodiments, the 2-, 5-, and 6-positions
of a pyrimidine nucleobase can be substituted with a conjugate moiety. Conjugation to
sugar moieties of nucleosides can occur at any carbon atom. Example carbon atoms of a
sugar moiety that can be attached to a conjugate moiety include the 2', 3', and 5' carbon
atoms. The 1' position can also be attached to a conjugate moiety, such as in an abasic
residue. Internucleosidic linkages can also bear conjugate moieties. For phosphorus

containing linkages (e.g., phosphodiester, phosphorothioate, phosphorodithiotate,
phosphoroamidate, and the like), the conjugate moiety can be attached directly to the
phosphorus atom or to an 0, N, or S atom bound to the phosphorus atom. For amine- or
amide-containing internucleosidic linkages (e.g., PNA), the conjugate moiety can be
attached to the nitrogen atom of the amine or amide or to an adjacent carbon atom.
        There are numerous methods for preparing conjugates of oligomeric compounds.
Generally, an oligomeric compound is attached to a conjugate moiety by contacting a
reactive group (e.g., OH, SH, amine, carboxyl, aldehyde, and the like) on the oligomeric
compound with a reactive group on the conjugate moiety. In some embodiments, one
reactive group is electrophilic and the other is nucleophilic.
        For example, an electrophilic group can be a carbonyl-containing functionality
and a nucleophilic group can be an amine or thiol. Methods for conjugation of nucleic
acids and related oligomeric compounds with and without linking groups are well
described in the literature such as, for example, in Manoharan in Antisense Research and
Applications, Crooke and LeBleu, eds., CRC Press, Boca Raton, Fla., 1993, Chapter 17,

Characteristic of Nucleic Acid-Lipid Particles
                In certain embodiments, the present invention relates to methods and
compositions for producing lipid-encapsulated nucleic acid particles in which nucleic
acids are encapsulated within a lipid layer. Such nucleic acid-lipid particles,
incorporating siRNA oligonucleotides, are characterized using a variety of biophysical
parameters including: (1)drug to lipid ratio; (2) encapsulation efficiency; and (3) particle
size. High drug to lipid rations, high encapsulation efficiency, good nuclease resistance
and serum stability and controllable particle size, generally less than 200 nm in diameter
are desirable. In addition, the nature of the nucleic acid polymer is of significance, since
the modification of nucleic acids in an effort to impart nuclease resistance adds to the
cost of therapeutics while in many cases providing only limited resistance. Unless stated
otherwise, these criteria are calculated in this specification as follows:
                Nucleic acid to lipid ratio is the amount of nucleic acid in a defined
volume of preparation divided by the amount of lipid in the same volume. This may be
on a mole per mole basis or on a weight per weight basis, or on a weight per mole basis.
For final, administration-ready formulations, the nucleic acid: lipid ratio is calculated after
dialysis, chromatography and/or enzyme (e.g., nuclease) digestion has been employed to
remove as much of the external nucleic acid as possible;
                Encapsulation efficiency refers to the drug to lipid ratio of the starting
mixture divided by the drug to lipid ratio of the final, administration competent
formulation. This is a measure of relative efficiency. For a measure of absolute
efficiency, the total amount of nucleic acid added to the starting mixture that ends up in
the administration competent formulation, can also be calculated. The amount of lipid
lost during the formulation process may also be calculated. Efficiency is a measure of the
wastage and expense of the formulation; and
                Size indicates the size (diameter) of the particles formed. Size distribution
may be determined using quasi-elastic light scattering (QELS) on a Nicomp Model 370
sub-micron particle sizer. Particles under 200 nm are preferred for distribution to neo
vascularized (leaky) tissues, such as neoplasms and sites of inflammation.

Pharmaceutical Compositions
         The lipid particles of present invention, particularly when associated with a
therapeutic agent, may beformulated as a pharmaceutical composition, e.g., which further
comprises a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent, excipient, or carrier, such as
physiological saline or phosphate buffer, selected in accordance with the route of
administration and standard pharmaceutical practice.
         In particular embodiments, pharmaceutical compositions comprising the lipid
nucleic acid particles of the invention are prepared according to standard techniques and
further comprise a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Generally, normal saline will be
employed as the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Other suitable carriers include, e.g.,
water, buffered water, 0.9% saline, 0.3% glycine, and the like, including glycoproteins
for enhanced stability, such as albumin, lipoprotein, globulin, etc. In compositions
comprising saline or other salt containing carriers, the carrier is preferably added
following lipid particle formation. Thus, after the lipid-nucleic acid compositions are
formed, the compositions can be diluted into pharmaceutically acceptable carriers such as
normal saline.
         The resulting pharmaceutical preparations may be sterilized by conventional, well
known sterilization techniques. The aqueous solutions can then be packaged for use or
filtered under aseptic conditions and lyophilized, the lyophilized preparation being
combined with a sterile aqueous solution prior to administration. The compositions may
contain pharmaceutically acceptable auxiliary substances as required to approximate
physiological conditions, such as pH adjusting and buffering agents, tonicity adjusting
agents and the like, for example, sodium acetate, sodium lactate, sodium chloride,
potassium chloride, calcium chloride, etc. Additionally, the lipidic suspension may
include lipid-protective agents which protect lipids against free-radical and lipid
peroxidative damages on storage. Lipophilic free-radical quenchers, such as a
tocopherol and water-soluble iron-specific chelators, such as ferrioxamine, are suitable.
         The concentration of lipid particle or lipid-nucleic acid particle in the
pharmaceutical formulations can vary widely, i.e., from less than about 0.0 1%, usually at
or at least about 0.05-5% to as much as 10 to 3 0% by weight and will be selected
primarily by fluid volumes, viscosities, etc., in accordance with the particular mode of
                                               112

administration selected. For example, the concentration may be increased to lower the
fluid load associated with treatment. This may be particularly desirable in patients
having atherosclerosis-associated congestive heart failure or severe hypertension.
Alternatively, complexes composed of irritating lipids may be diluted to low
concentrations to lessen inflammation at the site of administration. In one group of
embodiments, the nucleic acid will have an attached label and will be used for diagnosis
(by indicating the presence of complementary nucleic acid). In this instance, the amount
of complexes administered will depend upon the particular label used, the disease state
being diagnosed and the judgement of the clinician but will generally be between about
0.01 and about 50 mg per kilogram of body weight, preferably between about 0.1 and
about 5 mg/kg of body weight.
         As noted above, the lipid-therapeutic agent (e.g., nucleic acid) particels of the
invention may include polyethylene glycol (PEG)-modified phospholipids, PEG
ceramide, or ganglioside GMl-modified lipids or other lipids effective to prevent or limit
aggregation. Addition of such components does not merely prevent complex
aggregation. Rather, it may also provide a means for increasing circulation lifetime and
increasing the delivery of the lipid-nucleic acid composition to the target tissues.
         The present invention also provides lipid-therapeutic agent compositions in kit
form. The kit will typically be comprised of a container that is compartmentalized for
holding the various elements of the kit. The kit will contain the particles or
pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention, preferably in dehydrated or
concentrated form, with instructions for their rehydration or dilution and administration.
In certain embodiments, the particles comprise the active agent, while in other
embodiments, they do not.
Methods of Manufacture
         The methods and compositions of the invention make use of certain cationic
lipids, the synthesis, preparation and characterization of which is described below and in
the accompanying Examples. In addition, the present invention provides methods of
preparing lipid particles, including those associated with a therapeutic agent, e.g., a
nucleic acid. In the methods described herein, a mixture of lipids is combined with a
buffered aqueous solution of nucleic acid to produce an intermediate mixture containing
                                             113

  WO 2010/054406                                                             PCT/US2009/063933
nucleic acid encapsulated in lipid particles wherein the encapsulated nucleic acids are
present in a nucleic acid/lipid ratio of about 3 wt% to about 25 wt%, preferably 5 to 15
wt%. The intermediate mixture may optionally be sized to obtain lipid-encapsulated
nucleic acid particles wherein the lipid portions are unilamellar vesicles, preferably
having a diameter of 30 to 150 nm, more preferably about 40 to 90 nm. The pH is then
raised to neutralize at least a portion of the surface charges on the lipid-nucleic acid
particles, thus providing an at least partially surface-neutralized lipid-encapsulated
nucleic acid composition.
        As described above, several of these cationic lipids are amino lipids that are
charged at a pH below the pKa of the amino group and substantially neutral at a pH above
the pKa. These cationic lipids are termed titratable cationic lipids and can be used in the
formulations of the invention using a two-step process. First, lipid vesicles can be
formed at the lower pH with titratable cationic lipids and other vesicle components in the
presence of nucleic acids. In this manner, the vesicles will encapsulate and entrap the
nucleic acids. Second, the surface charge of the newly formed vesicles can be neutralized
by increasing the pH of the medium to a level above the pKa of the titratable cationic
lipids present, i.e., to physiological pH or higher. Particularly advantageous aspects of
this process include both the facile removal of any surface adsorbed nucleic acid and a
resultant nucleic acid delivery vehicle which has a neutral surface. Liposomes or lipid
particles having a neutral surface are expected to avoid rapid clearance from circulation
and to avoid certain toxicities which are associated with cationic liposome preparations.
Additional details concerning these uses of such titratable cationic lipids in the
formulation of nucleic acid-lipid particles are provided in U.S. Patent 6,287,591 and U.S.
Patent 6,858,225, incorporated herein by reference.
        It is further noted that the vesicles formed in this manner provide formulations of
uniform vesicle size with high content of nucleic acids. Additionally, the vesicles have a
size range of from about 30 to about 150 nm, more preferably about 30 to about 90 nm.
        Without intending to be bound by any particular theory, it is believed that the very
high efficiency of nucleic acid encapsulation is a result of electrostatic interaction at low
pH. At acidic pH (e.g. pH 4.0) the vesicle surface is charged and binds a portion of the
nucleic acids through electrostatic interactions. When the external acidic buffer is
                                               114

exchanged for a more neutral buffer (e.g., pH 7.5) the surface of the lipid particle or
liposome is neutralized, allowing any external nucleic acid to be removed. More detailed
information on the formulation process is provided in various publications (e.g., U.S.
Patent 6,287,591 and U.S. Patent 6,858,225).
        In view of the above, the present invention provides methods of preparing
lipid/nucleic acid formulations. In the methods described herein, a mixture of lipids is
combined with a buffered aqueous solution of nucleic acid to produce an intermediate
mixture containing nucleic acid encapsulated in lipid particles, e.g., wherein the
encapsulated nucleic acids are present in a nucleic acid/lipid ratio of about 10 wt% to
about 20 wt%. The intermediate mixture may optionally be sized to obtain lipid
encapsulated nucleic acid particles wherein the lipid portions are unilamellar vesicles,
preferably having a diameter of 30 to 150 nm, more preferably about 40 to 90 nm. The
pH is then raised to neutralize at least a portion of the surface charges on the lipid-nucleic
acid particles, thus providing an at least partially surface-neutralized lipid-encapsulated
nucleic acid composition.
        In certain embodiments, the mixture of lipids includes at least two lipid
components: a first lipid component of the present invention that is selected from among
lipids which have a pKa such that the lipid is cationic at pH below the pKa and neutral at
pH above the pKa, and a second lipid component that is selected from among lipids that
prevent particle aggregation during lipid-nucleic acid particle formation. In particular
embodiments, the amino lipid is a novel cationic lipid of the present invention.
        In preparing the nucleic acid-lipid particles of the invention, the mixture of lipids
is typically a solution of lipids in an organic solvent. This mixture of lipids can then be
dried to form a thin film or lyophilized to form a powder before being hydrated with an
aqueous buffer to form liposomes. Alternatively, in a preferred method, the lipid mixture
can be solubilized in a water miscible alcohol, such as ethanol, and this ethanolic solution
added to an aqueous buffer resulting in spontaneous liposome formation. In most
embodiments, the alcohol is used in the form in which it is commercially available. For
example, ethanol can be used as absolute ethanol (100%), or as 95% ethanol, the
remainder being water. This method is described in more detail in U.S. Patent 5,976,567).

         In one exemplary embodiment, the mixture of lipids is a mixture of cationic
lipids, neutral lipids (other than a cationic lipid), a sterol (e.g., cholesterol) and a PEG
modified lipid (e.g., a PEG-DMG or PEG-DMA) in an alcohol solvent. In preferred
embodiments, the lipid mixture consists essentially of a cationic lipid, a neutral lipid,
cholesterol and a PEG-modified lipid in alcohol, more preferably ethanol. In further
preferred embodiments, the first solution consists of the above lipid mixture in molar
ratios of about 20-70% cationic lipid: 5-45% neutral lipid:20-55% cholesterol:0.5-15%
PEG-modified lipid. In still further preferred embodiments, the first solution consists
essentially of a lipid chosen from Table 1 or Table 2, DSPC, Chol and PEG-DMG or
PEG-DMA, more preferably in a molar ratio of about 20-60% cationic lipid: 5-25%
DSPC:25-55% Chol:0.5-15% PEG-DMG or PEG-DMA. In particular embodiments, the
molar lipid ratio is approximately 40/10/40/10 (mol% cationic lipid/DSPC/Chol/PEG
DMG or PEG-DMA), 35/15/40/10 (mol% cationic lipid/DSPC/Chol/PEG-DMG or PEG
DMA) or 52/13/30/5 (mol% cationic lipid/DSPC/ChoI/PEG-DMG or PEG-DMA). In
another group of preferred embodiments, the neutral lipid in these compositions is
replaced with POPC, DPPC, DOPE or SM.
         In accordance with the invention, the lipid mixture is combined with a buffered
aqueous solution that may contain the nucleic acids. The buffered aqueous solution of is
typically a solution in which the buffer has a pH of less than the pKa of the protonatable
lipid in the lipid mixture. Examples of suitable buffers include citrate, phosphate,
acetate, and MES. A particularly preferred buffer is citrate buffer. Preferred buffers will
be in the range of 1-1000 mM of the anion, depending on the chemistry of the nucleic
acid being encapsulated, and optimization of buffer concentration may be significant to
achieving high loading levels (see, e.g., U.S. Patent 6,287,591 and U.S.
Patent 6,858,225).     Alternatively, pure water acidified to pH 5-6 with chloride, sulfate or
the like may be useful. In this case, it may be suitable to add 5% glucose, or another non
ionic solute which will balance the osmotic potential across the particle membrane when
the particles are dialyzed to remove ethanol, increase the pH, or mixed with a
pharmaceutically acceptable carrier such as normal saline. The amount of nucleic acid in
buffer can vary, but will typically be from about 0.01 mg/mL to about 200 mg/mL, more
preferably from about 0.5 mg/mL to about 50 mg/mL.
                                               116

  WO 2010/054406                                                              PCT/US2009/063933
        The mixture of lipids and the buffered aqueous solution of therapeutic nucleic
acids is combined to provide an intermediate mixture. The intermediate mixture is
typically a mixture of lipid particles having encapsulated nucleic acids. Additionally, the
intermediate mixture may also contain some portion of nucleic acids which are attached
to the surface of the lipid particles (liposomes or lipid vesicles) due to the ionic attraction
of the negatively-charged nucleic acids and positively-charged lipids on the lipid particle
surface (the amino lipids or other lipid making up the protonatable first lipid component
are positively charged in a buffer having a pH of less than the pKa of the protonatable
group on the lipid). In one group of preferred embodiments, the mixture of lipids is an
alcohol solution of lipids and the volumes of each of the solutions is adjusted so that upon
combination, the resulting alcohol content is from about 20% by volume to about 45% by
volume. The method of combining the mixtures can include any of a variety of
processes, often depending upon the scale of formulation produced. For example, when
the total volume is about 10-20 mL or less, the solutions can be combined in a test tube
and stirred together using a vortex mixer. Large-scale processes can be carried out in
suitable production scale glassware.
        Optionally, the lipid-encapsulated therapeutic agent (e.g., nucleic acid) complexes
which are produced by combining the lipid mixture and the buffered aqueous solution of
therapeutic agents (nucleic acids) can be sized to achieve a desired size range and
relatively narrow distribution of lipid particle sizes. Preferably, the compositions
provided herein will be sized to a mean diameter of from about 70 to about 200 nm, more
preferably about 90 to about 130 nm. Several techniques are available for sizing
liposomes to a desired size. One sizing method is described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,737,323,
incorporated herein by reference. Sonicating a liposome suspension either by bath or
probe sonication produces a progressive size reduction down to small unilamellar
vesicles (SUVs) less than about 0.05 microns in size. Homogenization is another method
which relies on shearing energy to fragment large liposomes into smaller ones. In a
typical homogenization procedure, multilamellar vesicles are recirculated through a
standard emulsion homogenizer until selected liposome sizes, typically between about 0.1
and 0.5 microns, are observed. In both methods, the particle size distribution can be
                                              117

  WO 2010/054406                                                             PCT/US2009/063933
monitored by conventional laser-beam particle size determination. For certain methods
herein, extrusion is used to obtain a uniform vesicle size.
        Extrusion of liposome compositions through a small-pore polycarbonate
membrane or an asymmetric ceramic membrane results in a relatively well-defined size
distribution. Typically, the suspension is cycled through the membrane one or more
times until the desired liposome complex size distribution is achieved. The liposomes
may be extruded through successively smaller-pore membranes, to achieve a gradual
reduction in liposome size. In some instances, the lipid-nucleic acid compositions which
are formed can be used without any sizing.
        In particular embodiments, methods of the present invention further comprise a
step of neutralizing at least some of the surface charges on the lipid portions of the lipid
nucleic acid compositions. By at least partially neutralizing the surface charges,
unencapsulated nucleic acid is freed from the lipid particle surface and can be removed
from the composition using conventional techniques. Preferably, unencapsulated and
surface adsorbed nucleic acids are removed from the resulting compositions through
exchange of buffer solutions. For example, replacement of a citrate buffer (pH about 4.0,
used for forming the compositions) with a HEPES-buffered saline (HBS pH about 7.5)
solution, results in the neutralization of liposome surface and nucleic acid release from
the surface. The released nucleic acid can then be removed via chromatography using
standard methods, and then switched into a buffer with a pH above the pKa of the lipid
used.
        Optionally the lipid vesicles (i.e., lipid particles) can be formed by hydration in an
aqueous buffer and sized using any of the methods described above prior to addition of
the nucleic acid. As described above, the aqueous buffer should be of a pH below the
pKa of the amino lipid. A solution of the nucleic acids can then be added to these sized,
preformed vesicles. To allow encapsulation of nucleic acids into such "pre-formed"
vesicles the mixture should contain an alcohol, such as ethanol. In the case of ethanol, it
should be present at a concentration of about 20% (w/w) to about 45% (w/w). In
addition, it may be necessary to warm the mixture of pre-formed vesicles and nucleic
acid in the aqueous buffer-ethanol mixture to a temperature of about 250 C to about 50' C
depending on the composition of the lipid vesicles and the nature of the nucleic acid. It
                                               118

will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that optimization of the encapsulation
process to achieve a desired level of nucleic acid in the lipid vesicles will require
manipulation of variable such as ethanol concentration and temperature. Examples of
suitable conditions for nucleic acid encapsulation are provided in the Examples. Once
the nucleic acids are encapsulated within the prefromed vesicles, the external pH can be
increased to at least partially neutralize the surface charge. Unencapsulated and surface
adsorbed nucleic acids can then be removed as described above.
Method of Use
        The lipid particles of the present invention may be used to deliver a therapeutic
agent to a cell, in vitro or in vivo. In particular embodiments, the therapeutic agent is a
nucleic acid, which is delivered to a cell using a nucleic acid-lipid particles of the present
invention. While the following description o various methodsof using the lipid particles
and related pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention are exemplified by
description related to nucleic acid-lipid particles, it is understood that these methods and
compositions may be readily adapted for the delivery of any therapeutic agent for the
treatment of any disease or disorder that would benefit from such treatment.
        In certain embodiments, the present invention provides methods for introducing a
nucleic acid into a cell. Preferred nucleic acids for introduction into cells are siRNA,
immune-stimulating oligonucleotides, plasmids, antisense and ribozymes. These
methods may be carried out by contacting the particles or compositions of the present
invention with the cells for a period of time sufficient for intracellular delivery to occur.
        The compositions of the present invention can be adsorbed to almost any cell
type. Once adsorbed, the nucleic acid-lipid particles can either be endocytosed by a
portion of the cells, exchange lipids with cell membranes, or fuse with the cells. Transfer
or incorporation of the nucleic acid portion of the complex can take place via any one of
these pathways. Without intending to be limited with respect to the scope of the
invention, it is believed that in the case of particles taken up into the cell by endocytosis
the particles then interact with the endosomal membrane, resulting in destabilization of
the endosomal membrane, possibly by the formation of non-bilayer phases, resulting in
introduction of the encapsulated nucleic acid into the cell cytoplasm. Similarly in the
                                                119

case of direct fusion of the particles with the cell plasma membrane, when fusion takes
place, the liposome membrane is integrated into the cell membrane and the contents of
the liposome combine with the intracellular fluid. Contact between the cells and the
lipid-nucleic acid compositions, when carried out in vitro, will take place in a
biologically compatible medium. The concentration of compositions can vary widely
depending on the particular application, but is generally between about 1 pmol and about
10 mmol. In certain embodiments, treatment of the cells with the lipid-nucleic acid
compositions will generally be carried out at physiological temperatures (about 37 0 C) for
periods of time from about 1 to 24 hours, preferably from about 2 to 8 hours. For in vitro
applications, the delivery of nucleic acids can be to any cell grown in culture, whether of
plant or animal origin, vertebrate or invertebrate, and of any tissue or type. In preferred
embodiments, the cells will be animal cells, more preferably mammalian cells, and most
preferably human cells.
         In one group of embodiments, a lipid-nucleic acid particle suspension is added to
60-80% confluent plated cells having a cell density of from about 103 to about 105
cells/mL, more preferably about 2 x 104 cells/mL. The concentration of the suspension
added to the cells is preferably of from about 0.01 to 20 pg/mL, more preferably about 1
pg/mL.
         In another embodiment, the lipid particles of the invention can be may be used to
deliver a nucleic acid to a cell or cell line (for example, a tumor cell line). Non-limiting
examples of such cell lines include: HELA (ATCC Cat N: CCL-2), KB (ATCC Cat N:
CCL-17), HEP3B (ATCC Cat N: HB-8064), SKOV-3 (ATCC Cat N: HTB-77), HCT
116 (ATCC Cat N: CCL-247), HT-29 (ATCC Cat N: H TB-38), PC-3 (ATCC Cat N:
CRL-1435), A549 (ATCC Cat N: CCL-185), MDA-MB-231 (ATCC Cat N: HTB-26).
         Typical applications include using well known procedures to provide intracellular
delivery of siRNA to knock down or silence specific cellular targets. Alternatively
applications include delivery of DNA or mRNA sequences that code for therapeutically
useful polypeptides. In this manner, therapy is provided for genetic diseases by
supplying deficient or absent gene products (i.e., for Duchenne's dystrophy, see Kunkel,
et al., Brit. Med. Bull. 45(3):630-643 (1989), and for cystic fibrosis, see Goodfellow,
Nature 341:102-103 (1989)). Other uses for the compositions of the present invention

include introduction of antisense oligonucleotides in cells (see, Bennett, et al., Mol.
Pharm. 41:1023-1033 (1992)).
         Alternatively, the compositions of the present invention can also be used for
deliver of nucleic acids to cells in vivo, using methods which are known to those of skill
in the art. With respect to delivery of DNA or mRNA sequences, Zhu, et al., Science
261:209-211 (1993), incorporated herein by reference, describes the intravenous delivery
of cytomegalovirus (CMV)-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) expression plasmid
using DOTMA-DOPE complexes. Hyde, et al., Nature 362:250-256 (1993),
incorporated herein by reference, describes the delivery of the cystic fibrosis
transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene to epithelia of the airway and to
alveoli in the lung of mice, using liposomes. Brigham, et al., Am. J. Med. Sci. 298:278
281 (1989), incorporated herein by reference, describes the in vivo transfection of lungs
of mice with a functioning prokaryotic gene encoding the intracellular enzyme,
chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT). Thus, the compositions of the invention can
be used in the treatment of infectious diseases.
         For in vivo administration, the pharmaceutical compositions are preferably
administered parenterally, i.e., intraarticularly, intravenously, intraperitoneally,
subcutaneously, or intramuscularly. In particular embodiments, the pharmaceutical
compositions are administered intravenously or intraperitoneally by a bolus injection.
For one example, see Stadler, et al., U.S. Patent No. 5,286,634, which is incorporated
herein by reference. Intracellular nucleic acid delivery has also been discussed in
Straubringer, et al., METHODS INENZYMOLOGY, Academic Press, New York.

Crit. Rev. Other.Drug CarrierSyst. 6:239-271 (1989), and Behr, Acc. Chem. Res.
26:274-278 (1993). Still other methods of administering lipid-based therapeutics are
described in, for example, Rahman et al., U.S. Patent No. 3,993,754; Sears, U.S. Patent
No. 4,145,410; Papahadjopoulos et al., U.S. Patent No. 4,235,871; Schneider, U.S. Patent
No. 4,224,179; Lenk et al., U.S. Patent No. 4,522,803; and Fountain et al., U.S. Patent
No. 4,588,578.
         In other methods, the pharmaceutical preparations may be contacted with the
target tissue by direct application of the preparation to the tissue. The application may be

made by topical, "open" or "closed" procedures. By "topical," it is meant the direct
application of the pharmaceutical preparation to a tissue exposed to the environment,
such as the skin, oropharynx, external auditory canal, and the like. "Open" procedures
are those procedures which include incising the skin of a patient and directly visualizing
the underlying tissue to which the pharmaceutical preparations are applied. This is
generally accomplished by a surgical procedure, such as a thoracotomy to access the
lungs, abdominal laparotomy to access abdominal viscera, or other direct surgical
approach to the target tissue. "Closed" procedures are invasive procedures in which the
internal target tissues are not directly visualized, but accessed via inserting instruments
through small wounds in the skin. For example, the preparations may be administered to
the peritoneum by needle lavage. Likewise, the pharmaceutical preparations may be
administered to the meninges or spinal cord by infusion during a lumbar puncture
followed by appropriate positioning of the patient as commonly practiced for spinal
anesthesia or metrazamide imaging of the spinal cord. Alternatively, the preparations
may be administered through endoscopic devices.
        The lipid-nucleic acid compositions can also be administered in an aerosol
inhaled into the lungs (see, Brigham, et al., Am. J. Sci. 298(4):278-281 (1989)) or by
direct injection at the site of disease (Culver, Human Gene Therapy, MaryAnn Liebert,
Inc., Publishers, New York. pp. 7 0 - 7 1 (1994)).
        The methods of the present invention may be practiced in a variety of hosts.
Preferred hosts include mammalian species, such as humans, non-human primates, dogs,
cats, cattle, horses, sheep, and the like.
        Dosages for the lipid-therapeutic agent particles of the present invention will
depend on the ratio of therapeutic agent to lipid and the administrating physician's
opinion based on age, weight, and condition of the patient.
        In one embodiment, the present invention provides a method of modulating the
expression of a target polynucleotide or polypeptide. These methods generally comprise
contacting a cell with a lipid particle of the present invention that is associated with a
nucleic acid capable of modulating the expression of a target polynucleotide or
polypeptide. As used herein, the term "modulating" refers to altering the expression of a
target polynucleotide or polypeptide. In different embodiments, modulating can mean
                                               122

  WO 2010/054406                                                              PCT/US2009/063933
increasing or enhancing, or it can mean decreasing or reducing. Methods of measuring
the level of expression of a target polynucleotide or polypeptide are known and available
in the arts and include, e.g., methods employing reverse transcription-polymerase chain
reaction (RT-PCR) and immunohistochemical techniques. In particular embodiments,
the level of expression of a target polynucleotide or polypeptide is increased or reduced
by at least 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, or greater than 50% as compared to an
appropriate control value.
        For example, if increased expression of a polypeptide desired, the nucleic acid
may be an expression vector that includes a polynucleotide that encodes the desired
polypeptide. On the other hand, if reduced expression of a polynucleotide or polypeptide
is desired, then the nucleic acid may be, e.g., an antisense oligonucleotide, siRNA, or
microRNA that comprises a polynucleotide sequence that specifically hybridizes to a
polnucleotide that encodes the target polypeptide, thereby disrupting expression of the
target polynucleotide or polypeptide. Alternatively, the nucleic acid may be a plasmid
that expresses such an antisense oligonucletoide, siRNA, or microRNA.
        In one particular embodiment, the present invention provides a method of
modulating the expression of a polypeptide by a cell, comprising providing to a cell a
lipid particle that consists of or consists essentially of a lipid chosen from Table 1 or
Table 2, DSPC, Chol and PEG-DMG or PEG-DMA, e.g., in a molar ratio of about 20
60% cationic lipid: 5-25% DSPC:25-55% Chol:0.5-15% PEG-DMG or PEG-DMA,
wherein the lipid particle is assocated with a nucleic acid capable of modulating the
expression of the polypeptide. In particular embodiments, the molar lipid ratio is
approximately 40/10/40/10 (mol% cationic lipid/DSPC/Chol/PEG-DMG or PEG-DMA),
35/15/40/10 (mol% cationic lipid/DSPC/Chol/PEG-DMG or PEG-DMA) or 52/13/30/5
(mol% cationic lipid/DSPC/Chol/PEG-DMG or PEG-DMA). In another group of
embodiments, the neutral lipid in these compositions is replaced with POPC, DPPC,
DOPE or SM.
        In particular embodiments, the therapeutic agent is selected from an siRNA, a
microRNA, an antisense oligonucleotide, and a plasmid capable of expressing an siRNA,
a microRNA, or an antisense oligonucleotide, and wherein the siRNA, microRNA, or
antisense RNA comprises a polynucleotide that specifically binds to a polynucleotide that

encodes the polypeptide, or a complement thereof, such that the expression of the
polypeptide is reduced.
         In other embodiments, the nucleic acid is a plasmid that encodes the polypeptide
or a functional variant or fragment thereof, such that expression of the polypeptide or the
functional variant or fragment thereof is increased.
         In related embodiments, the present invention provides a method of treating a
disease or disorder characterized by overexpression of a polypeptide in a subject,
comprising providing to the subject a pharmaceutical composition of the present
invention, wherein the therapeutic agent is selected from an siRNA, a microRNA, an
antisense oligonucleotide, and a plasmid capable of expressing an siRNA, a microRNA,
or an antisense oligonucleotide, and wherein the siRNA, microRNA, or antisense RNA
comprises a polynucleotide that specifically binds to a polynucleotide that encodes the
polypeptide, or a complement thereof.
         In one embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition comprises a lipid particle
that consists of or consists essentially of a lipid chosen from Table 1 or Table 2, DSPC,
Chol and PEG-DMG or PEG-DMA, e.g., in a molar ratio of about 20-60% cationic lipid:
5-25% DSPC:25-55% Chol:0.5-15% PEG-DMG or PEG-DMA, wherein the lipid particle
is assocated with the therapeutic nucleic acid. In particular embodiments, the molar lipid
ratio is approximately 40/10/40/10 (mol% cationic lipid/DSPC/Chol/PEG-DMG or PEG

Synthesis of compound 6b
         To a flame dried 500 mL RB flask, freshly activated Mg turnings (2.4 g, 100
mmol) were added and the flask was equipped with a magnetic stir bar, an addition
funnel and a reflux condenser. This set-up was degassed and flushed with argon and 10
mL of anhydrous ether was added to the flask via syringe. The bromide 3 (26.5 g, 80.47
mmol) was dissolved in anhydrous ether (50 mL) and added to the addition funnel. About
5 mL of this ether solution was added to the Mg turnings while stirring vigorously. An
exothermic reaction was noticed (to confirm/accelerate the Grignard reagent formation, 5
mg of iodine was added and immediate decolorization was observed confirming the
formation of the Grignard reagent) and the ether started refluxing. The rest of the solution
of the bromide was added dropwise while keeping the reaction under gentle reflux by
cooling the flask in water. After the completion of the addition the reaction mixture was
kept at 35 0C for 1 h and then cooled in ice bath. Ethyl formate (2.68 g, 36.2 mmol) was
dissolved in anhydrous ether (40 mL) and transferred to the addition funnel and added
dropwise to the reaction mixture with stirring. An exothermic reaction was observed and
the reaction mixture started refluxing. After the initiation of the reaction the rest of the
ethereal solution of formate was quickly added as a stream and the reaction mixture was
stirred for a further period of 1 h at ambient temperature. The reaction was quenched by
adding 10 mL of acetone dropwise followed by ice cold water (60 mL). The reaction

Synthesis of compound 7
         To a solution of the alcohol 6b (3 g, 5.68 mmol) in CH2 Cl 2 (60 mL), freshly
activated 4 A molecular sieves (50 g) were added and to this solution powdered PCC (4.9
g, 22.7 mmol) was added portion wise over a period of 20 minutes and the mixture was
further stirred for 1 hour (Note: careful monitoring of the reaction is necessary in order to
get good yields since prolonged reaction times leads to lower yields) and the TLC of the
reaction mixture was followed every 10 minutes (5 % ether in hexanes) After completion
of the reaction, the reaction mixture was filtered through a pad of silica gel and the
residue was washed with CH 2Cl 2 (400 mL). The filtrate was concentrated and the thus
obtained crude product was further purified by column chromatography (silica gel, 1%

An ice-cold solution of compound 650 (1.05 g, 10.7 mmol) and NEt 3 (1.2 eq) in DCM
(50 mL) was treated in a dropwise fashion over 5 min with MsCl (1.1 eq). After 1 h at
00 C, aqueous workup gave crude mesylate (1.88 g, 99 %, pure by TLC) which was used
without purification in the next step. The mesylate (10.5 mmol) was treated with 33 %
H2NMe in EtOH (100 mL) at 50'C over 18 h. Excess H 2NMe was removed by co
evaporation with Et 2 0, then the ethanolic solution of the product was treated with conc.
HCl (2 eq). The EtOH was removed by evaporation and the residue was redissolved in
DCM (100 mL). NEt3 (4 eq) was added followed by Cbz-OSu (1.5 eq) and the mixture
was stirred at r.t. for 3 h. Aqueous workup then column chromatography gave pure

Synthesis of 654A and 654B:
To a solution of compound 640 (5g, 0.01930mol) in a mixture of (10:1) mixture of
acetone and water (220ml) in a single neck 500ml RBF was added NMO (6.784g,
0.05791mol) followed by a 6.25% solution of Os0          4 (0.245g, 0.0009652mol) in tert
butanol. The resulting solution was stirred at room temperature and progress of the
reaction was monitored by TLC. After complete consumption of compound 640 (~2.0 h
by TLC) reaction mixture was quenched with 100ml aqueous Na 2SO 3 solution and the
mixture was stirred at room temperature for 1.0 h. Aqueous phase was then extracted well
with dichloromethane (2 x 250ml) and separated out. Organic layer was washed with sat.
NaHCO 3 (2 x 50ml) followed by brine (1 x 50ml). Organic phase was then dried over
Na 2SO 4 , filtered and concentrated in vacuum to give crude mass, which was subjected to
column purification on 60-120 mesh silica gel and eluted with 6-10% methanol in
dichloromethane system to afford pure diastereomeric mixture as thick yellow oil. Yield:

cyanoethyl-phosphoramidite were purchased from (Promega). All phosphoramidites
were used at a concentration of 0.2M in acetonitrile (CH 3CN) except for guanosine which
was used at 0.2M concentration in 10% THF/ANC (v/v). Coupling/recycling time of 16
minutes was used. The activator was 5-ethyl thiotetrazole (0.75M, American
International Chemicals), for the PO-oxidation Iodine/Water/Pyridine was used and the
PS-oxidation PADS (2 %) in 2,6-lutidine/ACN (1:1 v/v) was used.
        3'-ligand conjugated strands were synthesized using solid support containing the
corresponding ligand. For example, the introduction of cholesterol unit in the sequence
was performed from a hydroxyprolinol-cholesterol phosphoramidite. Cholesterol was
tethered to trans-4-hydroxyprolinol via a 6-aminohexanoate linkage to obtain a
hydroxyprolinol-cholesterol moiety. 5'-end Cy-3 and Cy-5.5 (fluorophore) labeled
siRNAs were synthesized from the corresponding Quasar-570 (Cy-3) phosphoramidite
were purchased from Biosearch Technologies. Conjugation of ligands to 5'-end and or
internal position is achieved by using appropriately protected ligand-phosphoramidite
building block An extended 15 min coupling of 0.1M solution of phosphoramidite in
anhydrous CH 3CN in the presence of 5-(ethylthio)- 1H-tetrazole activator to a solid bound
oligonucleotide. Oxidation of the internucleotide phosphite to the phosphate was carried
out using standard iodine-water as reported (1) or by treatment with tert-butyl
hydroperoxide/acetonitrile/water (10: 87: 3) with 10 min oxidation wait time conjugated
oligonucleotide. Phosphorothioate was introduced by the oxidation of phosphite to
phosphorothioate by using a sulfur transfer reagent such as DDTT (purchased from AM
Chemicals), PADS and or Beaucage reagent The cholesterol phosphoramidite was
synthesized in house, and used at a concentration of 0.1 M in dichloromethane. Coupling
time for the cholesterol phosphoramidite was 16 minutes.
        After completion of synthesis, the support was transferred to a 100 ml glass
bottle(VWR). The oligonucleotide was cleaved from the support with simultaneous
deprotection of base and phosphate groups with 80 mL of a mixture of ethanolic
ammonia [ammonia: ethanol (3:1)] for 6.5h at 55 0C. The bottle was cooled briefly on ice
and then the ethanolic ammonia mixture was filtered into a new 250 ml bottle. The CPG
was washed with 2 x 40 mL portions of ethanol/water (1:1 v/v). The volume of the

mixture was then reduced to ~ 30 ml by roto-vap. The mixture was then frozen on dyince
and dried under vacuum on a speed vac.
        The dried residue was resuspended in 26 ml of triethylamine, triethylamine
trihydrofluoride (TEA.3HF) or pyridine-HF and DMSO (3:4:6) and heated at 60'C for 90
minutes to remove the tert-butyldimethylsilyl (TBDMS) groups at the 2' position. The
reaction was then quenched with 50 ml of 20mM sodium acetate and pH adjusted to 6.5,
and stored in freezer until purification.
        The oligoncuelotides were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC) prior to purification and selection of buffer and column depends on nature of the
sequence and or conjugated ligand.
        The ligand conjugated oligonucleotides were purified reverse phase preparative
HPLC. The unconjugated oligonucleotides were purified by anion-exchange HPLC on a
TSK gel column packed in house. The buffers were 20 mM sodium phosphate (pH 8.5) in
10% CH 3CN (buffer A) and 20 mM sodium phosphate (pH 8.5) in 10% CH 3CN, IM
NaBr (buffer B). Fractions containing full-length oligonucleotides were pooled, desalted,
and lyophilized. Approximately 0.15 OD of desalted oligonucleotidess were diluted in
water to 150 pl and then pipetted in special vials for CGE and LC/MS analysis.
Compounds were finally analyzed by LC-ESMS and CGE.
        For the preparation of siRNA, equimolar amounts of sense and antisense strand
were heated in lxPBS at 95'C for 5 min and slowly cooled to room temperature.
Integrity of the duplex was confirmed by HPLC analysis

Example 55: Serum stability assay for siRNA
        A medium throughput assay for initial sequence-based stability selection was
performed by the "stains all" approach. To perform the assay, an siRNA duplex was
incubated in 90% human serum at 37'C. Samples of the reaction mix were quenched at
various time points (at 0 min., 15, 30, 60, 120, and 240 min.) and subjected to
electrophoretic analysis (Figure 1). Cleavage of the RNA over the time course provided
information regarding the susceptibility of the siRNA duplex to serum nuclease
degradation.
        A radiolabeled dsRNA and serum stability assay was used to further characterize
                                                                         32
siRNA cleavage events. First, a siRNA duplex was 5'end-labeled with         P on either the
sense or antisense strand. The labeled siRNA duplex was incubated with 90% human
serum at 37'C, and a sample of the solution was removed and quenched at increasing
time points. The samples were analyzed by electrophoresis.

mL, excess) were added under argon. The reaction mixture was then allowed to stir at
ambient temperature overnight. Solvents and volatiles were removed under vacuum and
the residue was dissolved in DCM (200 mL) and charged on a column of silica gel
packed in ethyl acetate. The column was initially eluted with ethyl acetate and
subsequently with gradient of 5-10 % methanol in dichloromethane to afford the desired

Synthesis of 2002: To 660ml of freshly distilled toluene in a 2L multineck RB flask
fitted with reflux condenser under argon was added sodium pieces (41.1 g, 1.785 mol). To
this was added TMSCl (192 mL, 1.499 mol) slowly and heated to 40'C after addition.
Then a solution of 2001(1 1Og, 0.357 mol) in 275ml of freshly distilled toluene was added
slowly by maintaining the reaction temperature at 40'C over a period of Ihr. It was then
refluxed for 2-3hrs. After 3hrs the reaction mass turned pale purple in color (TLC).
Heating was stopped and the reaction mass was cooled to room temperature, filtered
through a pad of celite and washed with toluene. (CAUTION: The reaction mixture
contained unreacted sodium pieces). The filtrate obtained was stirred with 3L of sat.
NH 4 Cl solution for 15 - 20 minutes until the silyl ether converted to the required a-keto
alcohol. The organic layer was separated and the aqueous layer was washed with ethyl
acetate (3xI000ml). The combined organic layer was washed with brine (IL), dried over
sodium sulfate, filtered and evaporated at reduced pressure to obtain the crude material,
which was purified by silica gel chromatography using hexane/ethyl acetate as eluent.
The product got eluted at 3% ethyl acetate in hexane to get 2002 (44 g, 47%) as a pale

cationic lipids using an in vivo rodent Factor VII silencing model.
         Factor VII (FVII), a prominent protein in the coagulation cascade, is synthesized
in the liver (hepatocytes) and secreted into the plasma. FVII levels in plasma can be
determined by a simple, plate-based colorimetric assay. As such, FVII represents a
convenient model for determining sirna-mediated downregulation of hepatocyte-derived
proteins, as well as monitoring plasma concentrations and tissue distribution of the
nucleic acid lipid particles and siRNA.

The cationic lipids shown above were used to formulate liposomes containing the AD
1661 duplex using an in-line mixing method, as described in U.S. provisional patent
application 61/228,373. Lipid particles were formulated using the following molar ratio:
50% Cationic lipid/ 10% distearoylphosphatidylcholine (DSPC) / 38.5% Cholesterol/
1.5% PEG-DMG (1-(monomethoxy-polyethyleneglycol)-2,3-dimyristoylglycerol,              with
an average PEG molecular weight of 2000).
        C57BL/6 mice (Charles River Labs, MA) received either saline or formulated
siRNA via tail vein injection. At various time points after administration, serum samples
were collected by retroorbital bleed. Serum levels of Factor VII protein were determined
in samples using a chromogenic assay (Biophen FVII, Aniara Corporation, OH). To
determine liver mRNA levels of Factor VII, animals were sacrificed and livers were
harvested and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Tissue lysates were prepared from the
frozen tissues and liver mRNA levels of Factor VII were quantified using a branched
DNA assay (QuantiGene Assay, Panomics, CA).
        FVII activity was evaluated in FVII siRNA-treated animals at 48 hours after
intravenous (bolus) injection in C57BL/6 mice. FVII was measured using a
commercially available kit for determining protein levels in serum or tissue, following
the manufacturer's instructions at a microplate scale. FVII reduction was determined
against untreated control mice, and the results were expressed as % Residual FVII. Two
dose levels (0.05 and 0.005 mg/kg FVII siRNA) were used in the screen of each novel
liposome composition. Figure 6 shows a graph illustrating the relative FVII protein levels
in animals administered with 0.05 or 0.005 mg/kg of lipid particles containing different
cationic lipids.

Example 80 siRNA formulation using preformed vesicles
        Cationic lipid containing particles were made using the preformed vesicle method.
Cationic lipid, DSPC, cholesterol and PEG-lipid were solubilised in ethanol at a molar
ratio of 40/10/40/10, respectively. The lipid mixture was added to an aqueous buffer
(50mM citrate, pH 4) with mixing to a final ethanol and lipid concentration of 30%
(vol/vol) and 6.1 mg/mL respectively and allowed to equilibrate at room temperature for
2 min before extrusion. The hydrated lipids were extruded through two stacked 80 nm
pore-sized filters (Nuclepore) at 22 0C using a Lipex Extruder (Northern Lipids,
Vancouver, BC) until a vesicle diameter of 70-90 nm, as determined by Nicomp analysis,
was obtained. This generally required 1-3 passes. For some cationic lipid mixtures which
did not form small vesicles hydrating the lipid mixture with a lower pH buffer (50mM
citrate, pH 3) to protonate the phosphate group on the DSPC headgroup helped form
stable 70-90 nm vesicles.
The FVII siRNA (solubilised in a 50mM citrate, pH 4 aqueous solution containing 30%
ethanol) was added to the vesicles, pre-equilibrated to 35 0 C, at a rate of-5mL/min with
mixing. After a final target siRNA/lipid ratio of 0.06 (wt/wt) was achieved, the mixture
was incubated for a further 30 min at 35 0 C to allow vesicle re-organization and
encapsulation of the FVII siRNA. The ethanol was then removed and the external buffer
replaced with PBS (155mM NaCl, 3mM Na2HPO4, ImM KH2PO4, pH 7.5) by either
dialysis or tangential flow diafiltration. The final encapsulated siRNA-to-lipid ratio was
determined after removal of unencapsulated siRNA using size-exclusion spin columns or
ion exchange spin columns.
Example 81: In vivo determination of efficacy of novel lipid formulations
         Test formulations were initially assessed for their FVII knockdown in female 7-9
week old, 15-25g, female C57Bl/6 mice at 0.1, 0.3, 1.0 and 5.0 mg/kg with 3 mice per
treatment group. All studies included animals receiving either phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS, Control group) or a benchmark formulation. Formulations were diluted to the
appropriate concentration in PBS immediately prior to testing. Mice were weighed and
the appropriate dosing volumes calculated (10 pl/g body weight). Test and benchmark
formulations as well as PBS (for Control animals) were administered intravenously via
                                              245

the lateral tail vein. Animals were anesthetised 24 h later with an intraperitoneal
injection of Ketamine/Xylazine and 500-700 ptl of blood was collected by cardiac
puncture into serum separator tubes (BD Microtainer). Blood was centrifuged at 2,000 x
g for 10 min at 150 C and serum was collected and stored at -70 0 C until analysis. Serum
samples were thawed at 37 0 C for 30 min, diluted in PBS and aliquoted into 96-well
assay plates. Factor VII levels were assessed using a chromogenic assay (Biophen FVII
kit, Hyphen BioMed) according to manufacturer's instructions and absorbance measured
in microplate reader equipped with a 405 nm wavelength filter. Plasma FVII levels were
quantified and ED50s (dose resulting in a 50% reduction in plasma FVII levels compared
to control animals) calculated using a standard curve generated from a pooled sample of
serum from Control animals. Those formulations of interest showing high levels of FVII
knockdown (ED50 << 0.1 mg/kg) were re-tested in independent studies at a lower dose
range to confirm potency and establish ED50. The ED50 values of a representative
number of compounds is shown in Table 8
Example 82: Determination of pKa of formulated lipids
The pKa's of the different ionisable cationic lipids were determined essentially as
described (Eastman et al 1992 Biochemistry 31:4262-4268) using the fluorescent probe
2-(p-toluidino)-6-naphthalenesulfonic acid (TNS), which is non-fluorescent in water but
becomes appreciably fluorescent when bound to membranes. Vesicles composed of
cationic lipid/DSPC/CH/PEG-c-DOMG (40:10:40:10 mole ratio) were diluted to 0.1mM
in buffers (130mM NaCl, 10mM CH 3COONH 4, 10mM MES, 10mM HEPES) of various
pH's, ranging from 2 to 11.   An aliquot of the TNS aqueous solution (1 pM final) was
added to the diluted vesicles and after a 30 second equilibration period the fluorescent of
the TNS-containing solution was measured at excitation and emission wavelengths of
321m and 445nm, respectively. The pKa of the cationic lipid-containing vesicles was
determined by plotting the measured fluorescence against the pH of the solutions and
fitting the data to a Sigmodial curve using the commercial graphing program IgorPro.
The pKa values for a representative number of compounds is shown in Table 8

reaction mass. The suspension was stirred for 2hrs, and the mass temperature slowly
raised to RT. After 2hrs the reaction mass became homogeneous. TLC showed the
absence of starting material. The reaction was quenched with 100ml of water, and
concentrated to remove excess solvent. The residue obtained was again diluted with
water (500ml), and extracted with DCM (4x500ml). The combined organic layer was
washed with brine (500ml), dried over sodium sulfate, filtered and evaporated at reduced
pressure to obtain the crude product, which was purified by silica gel chromatography
using hexane /ethyl acetate as eluent. The product eluted from 4% to 20% of ethyl acetate
in hexane to get 2003 (36g, 82%) as a white semisolid. 'H NMR (CDCl 3): 6 0.89 (t, 6H,
