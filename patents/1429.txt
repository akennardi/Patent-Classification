                                                 TITLE
     SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR PERFORMING ALTERNATIVE AND SEQUENTIAL
                       BLOOD AND PERITONEAL DIALYSIS MODALITIES
                                            BACKGROUND
             [0001] The examples discussed below relate generally to medical fluid delivery. More
  particularly, the examples disclose systems, methods and apparatuses for the control of fluid
  flow in kidney failure treatment systems.
             [0002] Due to various causes, a person's renal system can fail. Renal failure produces
  several physiological derangements. The balance of water, minerals and the excretion of daily
  metabolic load is no longer possible and toxic end products of nitrogen metabolism (urea,
  creatinine, uric acid, and others) can accumulate in blood and tissue.
            [0003] Kidney failure and reduced kidney function have been treated with dialysis.
  Dialysis removes waste, toxins and excess water from the body that would otherwise have been
  removed by normal functioning kidneys. Dialysis treatment for replacement of kidney functions
  is critical to many people because the treatment is life saving.
            [0004] Hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis are two types of dialysis therapies used
 commonly to treat loss of kidney function.         A hemodialysis ("HD") treatment utilizes the
 patient's blood to remove waste, toxins and excess water from the patient.           The patient is
 connected to a hemodialysis machine and the patient's blood is pumped through the machine,
 Catheters are inserted into the patient's veins and arteries so that blood can flow to and from the
 hemodialysis machine.       The blood passes through a dialyzer of the machine, which removes
 waste, toxins and excess water from the blood. The cleaned blood is returned to the patient. A
 large amount of dialysate, for example about 80 to 120 liters, is consumed during a single
 hemodialysis therapy. Hemodialysis treatment lasts several hours and is generally performed in
 a treatment center about three or four times per week.
           [0005] Another form of kidney failure treatment involving blood is hemofiltration
("HF"), which is an alternative renal replacement therapy that relies on a convective transport of
toxins from the patient's blood.         This therapy is accomplished by adding substitution or
replacement fluid to the extracorporeal circuit during treatment (typically ten to ninety liters of
such fluid).       That substitution fluid and the fluid accumulated by the patient in between
treatments is ultrafiltered over the course of the HF treatment, providing a convective transport
mechanism that is particularly beneficial in removing middle and large molecules.
                                                   1a'-

            [0006] Hemodiafiltration ("HDF") is another blood treatment modality that combines
   convective and diffusive clearances. HDF uses dialysate to flow through a dialyzer, similar to
   standard hemodialysis, providing diffusive clearance.        In addition, substitution solution is
  provided directly to the extracorporeal circuit, providing convective clearance.
           [00071 Peritoneal dialysis uses a dialysis solution, also called dialysate, which is infused
  into a patient's peritoneal cavity via a catheter. The dialysate contacts the peritoneal membrane
  of the peritoneal cavity. Waste, toxins and excess water pass from the patient's bloodstream,
  through the peritoneal membrane and into the dialysate due to diffusion and osmosis, i.e., an
  osmotic gradient occurs across the membrane. The spent dialysate is drained from the patient,
  removing waste, toxins and excess water from the patient. This cycle is repeated.
           [00081 There are various types of peritoneal dialysis therapies, including continuous
  ambulatory peritoneal dialysis ("CAPD"), automated peritoneal dialysis ("APD"), tidal flow
  dialysis and continuous flow peritoneal dialysis ("CFPD").            CAPD is a manual dialysis
  treatment.    The patient manually connects an implanted catheter to a drain, allowing spent
  dialysate fluid to drain from the peritoneal cavity. The patient then connects the catheter to a
 bag of fresh dialysate, infusing fresh dialysate through the catheter and into the patient. The
 patient disconnects the catheter from the fresh dialysate bag and allows the dialysate to dwell
 within the peritoneal cavity, wherein the transfer of waste, toxins and excess water takes place.
 After a dwell period, the patient repeats the manual dialysis procedure, for example, four times
 per day, each treatment lasting more than an hour.           Manual peritoneal dialysis requires a
 significant amount of time and effort from the patient, leaving ample room for improvement.
          [0009] Automated peritoneal dialysis ("APD") is similar to CAPD in that the dialysis
 treatment includes drain, fill, and dwell cycles. APD machines, however, perform the cycles
 automatically, typically while the patient sleeps. APD machines free patients from having to
manually perform the treatment cycles and from having to transport supplies during the day.
APD machines connect fluidly to an implanted catheter, to a source or bag of fresh dialysate and
to a fluid drain.    APD machines pump fresh dialysate from a dialysate source, through the
catheter, into the patient's peritoneal cavity, and allow the dialysate to dwell within the cavity,
and allow the transfer of waste, toxins and excess water to take place.           The source can be
multiple sterile dialysate solution bags.
         [0010] APD machines pump spent dialysate from the peritoneal cavity, though the
catheter, to the drain.    As with the manual process, several drain, fill and dwell cycles occur
during dialysate.    A "last fill" sometimes occurs at the end of APD, which remains in the
peritoneal cavity of the patient until the next treatment.
                                                   2

            [0011] Both CAPD and APD are batch type systems that send spent dialysis fluid to a
   drain. Tidal flow systems are modified batch systems. With tidal flow, instead of removing all
   of the fluid from the patient over a longer period of time, a portion of the fluid is removed and
  replaced after smaller increments of time.
           [0012] Continuous flow, or CFPD, systems clean or regenerate spent dialysate instead of
  discarding it. The systems pump fluid into and out of the patient, through a loop. Dialysate
  flows into the peritoneal cavity through one catheter lumen and out another catheter lumen. The
  fluid exiting the patient passes through a reconstitution device that removes waste from the
  dialysate, e.g., via a urea removal column that employs urease to enzymatically convert urea into
  ammonia.       The ammonia is then removed from the dialysate by adsorption prior to
  reintroduction of the dialysate into the peritoneal cavity. Additional sensors are employed to
  monitor the removal of ammonia. CFPD systems are typically more complicated than batch
  systems.
           [0013] It is known with PD therapy that the diffusive properties of the peritoneum
  degrade over time due at least in part to chronic exposure to glucose. While research has been
 done to find an alternative osmotic agent, glucose remains the industry standard. Accordingly, a
 need exists for an improved PD therapy, which addresses the degradation of the effectiveness of
 the diffusive properties of the peritoneum over time.
                                             SUMMARY
          [0014] The examples below describe systems that provide an improved dialysis
 treatment.     The systems address the degradation of clearance effectiveness of PD due to the
 chronic exposure of the peritoneum to glucose. In one preferred implementation of the systems
 described below, the systems are tailored to be used by the patient at home.           It should be
 appreciated however that the machines are not limited to at home use and can instead be adapted
 for in-center or hospital use.
          [0015] The systems in general provide an opportunity to the patient to alternate between
peritoneal dialysis ("PD") and hemodialysis ("HD").            Alternating therapies provides two
primary advantages, namely, preserving maximum residual renal function in PD and obtaining
maximum urea clearance through HD.            The systems provide "peritoneal rest" by enabling
patients to perform HD over given intervals of time. Preliminary studies (:          Tomo T et al J
Artif Organs, 2005; 8(2): 125-9;    (2)Zareie M., et a), Nepzhrol Dial Transplant, 2005 Jan; 20(1):
189-93; ( 3 Rodriquez A., Advanced Pi-eritonealDialysis, 2002; 18:7880) indicate that "peritoneal
rest" after one or more PD treatment allows the peritoneum to heal at least to some degree prior
to the next exposure to glucose.
                                                   3

             [0016] Disclosed below are three primary embodiments, namely, HD in combination
   with online batch PD, HD in combination with online continuous flow peritoneal dialysis
   ("CFPD"), and HD in combination with a simplified or bagged dialysate batch PD. In each of
  the three combinations, the HD therapy is the same, which is in one embodiment performed by
  making HD dialysate online and delivering the dialysate to and across the dialyzer to drain,
  while a blood pump pumps blood from a patient, to a dialyzer, cleaning the blood, and from the
  dialyzer, back to the patient.
             [0017] In combination with the HD therapy, the first, online batch PD therapy swaps out
  the concentrates used to make HD dialysate with a PD dialysate concentrate and possibly a
  chemical disinfectant. The HD system hot water disinfects all blood and dialysate lines after a
  treatment in one embodiment. A subsequent PD treatment may also require that a chemical
  disinfectant be used alternatively or additionally with the hot water disinfection due to the fact
  that PD dialysate is delivered directly to the patient, heightening the need to high purity or
  sterility.
            [0018] The online batch PD treatment primes the entire system with PD dialysate, after
 which a PD connection set 100 is connected to the primed and reused arterial and venous lines.
 The PD connection set is itself primed via pumping or gravity, after which the PD connection set
 is placed in fluid communication with the patient's transfer set.         Batch PD dialysis is then
 performed with multiple fill, dwell and drain (full or tidal drains) cycles. Each drain cycle
 removes an amount of ultrafiltrate ("UF") absorbed via an osmotic gradient provided by the PD
 dialysate. If needed, an initial drain can be performed to remove a PD last fill from a patient's
 previous PD treatment.
           [0019] In combination with the HD therapy, the second, CFPD therapy also swaps out
 the concentrates used to make HD dialysate with a PD dialysate concentrate and possibly the
chemical disinfectant. The CFPD therapy can prime all lines the same as with the online batch
PD treatment.
           [0020] One primary difference between online batch PD and CFPD is that the CFPD
connection set is a dual lumen connection set, while the online batch PD connection set can be a
single lumen connection set that Y's or T's to connect to both the arterial and venous lines. The
dual lumen CFPD connection set enables PD dialysate to be delivered to and removed from the
patient's peritoneum simultaneously.
          [0021] Another primary difference between CFPD and batch online PD is that CFPD
flows PD dialysate continuously across the outsides of the dialyzer membranes to drain, while
batch online PD pushes PD dialysate across the dialyzer membranes, into the PD patient circuit,
into the patient for batch filling, and then stops. CFPD flows PD dialysate continuously on both
                                                   4

   sides of the dialyzer membranes in a manner similar to HD. The PD dialysate on the outsides of
  the dialyzer membranes osmotically cleans the PD dialysate on the insides of the dialyzer
  membranes, so that the PD dialysate delivered to the patient is continuously freshened. Again,
  the PD dialysate on the outside of the dialyzer membranes, which osmotically pulls patient
  waste products from the PD dialysate on the insides of the dialyzer membranes, is delivered to
  drain in one embodiment.
            [0022] In combination with the HD therapy, the third, bagged dialysate batch PD therapy
  does not make dialysate online. Instead, a source of PD dialysate, such as a bag or container, is
  used. A single line patient connection set is used instead of the "Y" or "T" patient connection
  set used with online batch PD. The HD blood pump is used to pull PD dialysate from the source
  and push the PD dialysate through the dialyzer, the venous line and the single line patient
  connection set for priming, and then to the patient once priming is completed.
            [0023] After a specified dwell period, the used dialys ate or from-dialyzer dialysate pump
  is used to pull spent dialysate from the patient, across the dialyzer membranes, to drain. A new
  fill cycle can then be commenced.       If the container is a single fill container, which is expired
 after the first fill, the blood pump can alternatively be used to drain the patient and push the
 effluent dialysate back to the source.
           [0024] Multiple pneumatic configurations for pumping at higher pressures (positive and
 negative) for HD and at lower pressures (positive and negative) for PD are disclosed. Providing
 multiple pneumatic storage tanks with selective valving and/or providing electrically variable
 pressure regulators are examples discussed in detail below for providing higher pressures on HD
 therapy days and lower pressures on PD therapy days.
           [0025] An alternative electrically controlled configuration is also disclosed. The pumps,
and valves of the present disclosure are not limited to pneumatic pumps and valves. Peristaltic
pumps operating with volumetric metering devices and solenoid pinch clamps, as disclosed
below, may be used alternatively.
          [0026] It is an advantage of the present disclosure to provide combination hemodialysis
and peritoneal dialysis systems that can provide alternative therapies to the same patient on
different days.
          [0027] Another advantage of the present disclosure is to provide a single structure
yielding multiple systems for automatically performing different modalities of dialysis as
desired or prescribed.
          [0028] A further advantage of the present disclosure is to provide a single structure that
can pump at different pressures for different treatment modalities or therapies.
                                                    5

           [0029] It is still another advantage of the patient disclosure to provide systems and
  methods that reuse the same (or largely the same) disposables for different therapies or treatment
  modalities.
           [0030] It is yet another advantage of the patient disclosure to provide online systems and
  methods that can be used for multiple therapies or treatment modalities.
           [0031] Additional features and advantages are described herein, and will be apparent
 from, the following Detailed Description and the figures.

                                     DETAILED DESCRIPTION
                                           HD and Batch PD
            [0042] Referring now to the drawings and in particular to Fig. 1, one embodiment for a
   combined PD/HD system is illustrated by system 10a. Fig. 1 is a simplified version of a
   hemodialysis ("HD") system. System 10a and any of the systems discussed here can include
   any of the structure and functionality described in U.S. Publication No. 2008/0216898, entitled,
  "Cassette System Integrated Apparatus", filed February 27, 2008, and in U.S. Publication No.
  2013/0037480, entitled, "Hemodialysis Systems And Methods", filed August 8, 2012, the entire
  contents of each of which (referred to herein as the "referenced publications") are hereby
  incorporated by reference and relied upon. Generally, the systems shown herein include a very
  simplified version of the dialysate or process fluid delivery circuit. The blood circuits are also
  simplified but not to the degree that the dialysate circuit is simplified. It should be appreciated
  that the circuits have been simplified to make the description of the present disclosure easier,
  and that the systems if implemented would have additional structure and functionality, such as is
  found in the referenced publications listed above.
           [0043] System 10a of Fig, I includes a blood circuit 20. Blood circuit 20 pulls blood
  from and returns blood to a patient 12. Blood is pulled from patient 12 via an arterial line 14,
 and is returned to the patient via a venous line 16. Arterial line 14 includes an arterial line
 connector 14a that connects to an arterial needle 14b, which is in blood draw flow
 communication with patient 12.       Venous line 16 includes a venous line connector 16a that
 connects to a venous needle 16b, which is in blood return flow communication with the patient.
 Arterial and venous lines 14 and 16 also include line clamps 18a and 18v, which can be a spring
 loaded, fail safe mechanical pinch clamps. Line clamps 18a and 18v are closed automatically in
 an emergency situation in one embodiment.
          [0044] Arterial and venous lines 14 and 16 also include air or bubble detectors 22a and
22v, respectively, which can be ultrasonic air detectors. Air or bubble detectors 20a and 20v
look for air in the arterial and venous lines 14 and 16, respectively. If air is detected by one of
air detectors 22a and 22v, system 10a closes line clamps 18a and 18v, pauses the blood and
dialysate pumps and provides instructions to the patient to clear the air so that treatment can
resume.
         [0045] A blood pump 30 is located in arterial line 14 in the illustrated embodiment. In
the illustrated embodiment, blood pump 30 includes a first blood pump pod 30a and a second
blood pump pod 30b. Blood pump pod 30a operates with an inlet valve 32i and an outlet valve
                                                  7

   32o.   Blood pump pod 30b operates with an inlet valve 34i and an outlet valve 34o. In an
   embodiment, blood pump pods 30a and 30b are each blood receptacles that include a hard outer
   shell, e.g., spherical, with a flexible diaphragm located within the shell, forming a diaphragm
  pump. Once side of each diaphragm receives blood, while the other side of each diaphragm is
  operated by negative and positive air pressure.
            [0046] To operate blood pump pods 30a and 30b, taking pod 30a for example, inlet
  valve 32i is opened, while outlet valve 32o is closed, and while negative air pressure is applied
  to the diaphragm to draw blood into blood pump pod 30a. Conversely, inlet valve 32i is closed,
  while outlet valve 32o is opened, and while positive air pressure is applied to the diaphragm to
  push blood out of blood pump pod 30a. The same is done for blood pump pod 30b using inlet
  valve 34i and an outlet valve 34o.       In one embodiment, blood pump pods 30a and 30b are
  operated sequentially so that while blood pump pods 30a is drawing in blood, blood pump pod
  30b is pushing blood out, and vice versa. This allows blood flow to be relatively continuous
  through dialyzer 40.
           [00471 A heparin vial 24 and heparin pump 26 are located between blood pump 30 and
  dialyzer 40 in the illustrated embodiment.      Heparin pump 26 can be a pneumatic pump or a
 syringe pump (e.g., stepper motor driven syringe pump) as desired. Supplying heparin upstream
 of dialyzer 40 helps to prevent clotting of the dialyzer membranes.
           [0048] A control unit 50 includes one or more processor and memory, receives air
 detection signals from air detectors 22a and 22v (and other sensors of system 10a, such as
 temperature sensors, blood leak detectors, conductivity sensors and pressure sensors), and
 controls components such as line clamps 18a and 18v, blood pump 30, heparin pump 26, and the
 dialysate pumps (described below).
          [0049] Blood exiting dialyzer 40 flows through an airtrap 28, Airtrap 28 removes any
 air from the blood before the dialyzed blood is returned to patient 12 via venous line 16. Airtrmp
28 can also have a pierceable septum that allows blood samples to be removed from blood
circuit 20. Air that escapes airtrap 28 is sensed by venous air detector 22v. Control unit 50
receives the air sensed signal from venous air detector 22v and causes line clamps 18a and 18v
to close and the user interface of system IOa (which in one embodiment is a tablet user interface)
to display a clear air alarm screen. Arterial air detector 22a helps to detect whether arterial line
connector 14a is properly connected to arterial needle 14b. At the end of prime, system 10a can
pull blood from the patient into the arterial line 14 and venous line 16. At that time, venous air
detector 22b can be used with control unit 50 detect whether venous line connector 16a is
properly connected to venous needle 16b.

            [0050] With hemodialysis system 10a of Fig. 1, dialysis fluid or dialysate is pumped
   along the outside of the membranes of dialyzer 40, while blood is pumped through the insides of
  the dialyzer membranes. Dialysis fluid or dialysate is prepared beginning with the purification
  of water by water purification unit 60. One suitable water purification unit is set forth in U.S.
  Patent Publication No. 2011/0197971, entitled, "Water Purification System and Method", filed
  April 25, 2011, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference and relied
  upon. In one embodiment, water purification unit includes filters and other structure to purify
  tap water (e.g., remove pathogens and ions such as chlorine) so that the water is in one
  implementation below 0.03 endotoxin units/ml ("EU/ml") and below 0.1 colony forming
  units/ml ("CFU/mI"). Water purification unit 60 can be provided in a housing separate from the
  housing of the hemodialysis machine, which includes blood circuit 20 and a dialysate circuit 70.
           [0051] Dialysate circuit 70 is again highly simplified in Fig. 1 to ease illustration and to
  better highlight blood circuit 20. Dialysate circuit 70 in actuality can include all of the relevant
  structure and functionality set forth in the referenced publications. Certain features of dialysate
  circuit 70 are illustrated in Fig. 1, In particular, dialysate circuit 70 includes a to-dialyzer
  dialysate pump 64.     Pump 64 is in one embodiment configured the same a blood pump 30.
  Pump 64, like pump 30, includes a pair of pump pods, which again can be spherically
  configured. Only one pump pod 66 is illustrated, however, two pump pods are provided as with
  blood pump 30 in one embodiment. Inlet valve 68i and outlet valve 68o are sequenced with
 pump pod 66 to pull fluid into the pod (inlet valve 68i open, while outlet valve 68o closed) and
 to push fluid out of the pod (inlet valve 68i closed, while outlet valve 68o opened). The two
 pump pods, like with blood pump 30, are operated alternatingly so that one pump pod is filling
 with HD dialysate, while the other pump pod is expelling HD dialysate.
          [0052] Pump 64 is a to-dialyzer dialysate pump. There is another dual pod pump 96,
 like pump 64, located in drain line 82 to push used dialysate to drain. There is a third pod pump
 (not illustrated) used to pump purified water through bicarbonate cartridge 72. There is a fourth
 pod pump (not illustrated) used to pump acid from container 74 into missing line 62. The third
 and fourth pumps, the concentrate pumps, can be single pod pumps because continuous pumping
 is not as important in mixing line 62 because there is a buffering dialysate tank (not illustrated)
between mixing line 62 and to-dialyzer dialysate pump 64 in one embodiment.               A fifth pod
pump (not illustrated) provided in drain line 82 is used to remove a known amount of
ultrafiltration ("UF") when the HD therapy is provided.
         [0053] Purified water from water purification unit 60 is pumped along a mixing line 62
though a bicarbonate cartridge 72. Acid from a container 74 is pumped along mixing line 62
into the bicarbonated water flowing from bicarbonate cartridge 72 to form an electrolytically and
                                                    9

   physiologically compatible dialysate solution.           The pumps and temperature-compensated
   conductivity sensors used to properly mix the purified water with the bicarbonate and acid are
   not illustrated but are disclosed in detail in the referenced publications,
            [0054] Fig. 1 also illustrates that dialysate is pumped along a fresh dialysate line 76,
   through a heater 78 and an ultrafilter 80, before reaching dialyzer 40 and dialyzing blood of
  patient 12, after which the used dialysate is pumped to drain via drain line 82, Heater 78 heats
  the dialysate to body temperature or about 37"C. Ultrafilter 80 further cleans and purifies the
  dialysate before reaching dialyzer 40, filtering bugs or contaminants introduced for example via
  bicarbonate cartridge 72 or acid container 74 from the dialysate.
           [0055] Dialysate circuit 70 also includes a sample port 84 in the illustrated embodiment.
  Dialysate circuit 70 will further include a blood leak detector (not illustrated but used to detect if
  a dialyzer fiber is torn) and other components that are not illustrated, such as balance chambers,
  plural valves, and a dialysate holding tank, all illustrated and described in detail in the
  referenced applications.
           [0056] femodialysis system 10a is an online, pass-through system that pumps dialysate
  through the dialyzer one time and then pumps the used dialysate to drain. Both blood circuit 20
  and dialysate circuit 70 are hot water disinfected after each treatment, such that blood circuit 20
  and dialysate circuit 70 can be reused. In one implementation, blood circuit 20 including
 dialyzer 40 are hot water disinfected and reused daily for about one month, while dialysate
 circuit 70 is hot water disinfected and reused for about six months. Prior to running the hot
 water disinfections, system 10a returns or rinses back the blood to patient 12, To do so, system
  10a in one embodiment pushes dialysate across dialyzer 40 into blood circuit 20, which in turn
 pushes blood though both arterial and venous lines 14 and 16 back to patient 12.                In an
 embodiment, system 10a knows how much dialysate to push into blood circuit 20 by knowing
 the volume of the blood circuit and counting known volume pump strokes until that volume is
 reached. Alternatively or additionally, a blood leak detector can be added to blood circuit 20 to
 look for a color change (from blood to clear) to know when to stop the blood rinseback process.
In any case, at the end of the hemodialysis treatment, both circuits 20 and 70 are filled with
dialysate.
          [0057] Referring now to Figs. 2 and 3, system 10b, using largely the same equipment as
HD system 10a, is used instead to perform peritoneal dialysis. As discussed above in the
SUMMARY, it has been reported that there are therapeutic benefits to alternating or mixing in
peritoneal dialysis treatments into a hemodialysis regime and vice versa. System 10 (referring
collectively to systems l0a and l0b) allows hemodialysis to be performed one day and the
peritoneal dialysis to be performed the next day, and so on. Each element numbered the same in
                                                     10

  Figs. I to 3 includes all of the structure, functionality and alternatives discussed herein, for
  example, as discussed in connection with Fig. 1. There are a few differences discussed next
  between the structure of hemodialysis system 10a in Fig. I and the structure of peritoneal
  dialysis system 10b as illustrated in Figs. 2 and 3.
           [0058] One primary difference is that bicarbonate cartridge 72 and acid container 74 of
 hemodialysis system 10a have been replaced by disinfect source 86 and peritoneal dialysis
 concentrate source 88 in Figs. 2 and 3. Disinfect source 86 is used after the previous treatment,
 e.g., a hemodialysis treatment, during disinfection. Again, in one embodiment dialysis system
  10 (referring to both systems 10a and 10b) heat disinfects blood circuit 20 and dialysate circuit
 70 after treatment. If peritoneal dialysis is to be performed in the next treatment, then either
 before or after the hot water disinfection, system 10b operates a cycle in which a disinfectant is
 run through blood circuit 20 and dialysate circuit 70, e.g., over multiple passes, so that any bugs
 or contaminants left after the hot water disinfection has taken place are killed or removed to
 drain. This is done because instead of blood being pumped through blood circuit 20 in the next
 treatment, peritoneal dialysis fluid will be pumped through dialyzer 40, into arterial line 14 and
 venous line 16, and directly into patient 12. Accordingly, peritoneal dialysis system 10b must
 be as sterile as possible.
          [0059] Suitable disinfectants for source 86 include renalin and peracetic acid, sold by
 under tradenames, such as PericidinTM, ActrilTM, Peristeril PlusM and Puristeril 340TM and
 MinncareM. System 10b can in an embodiment proportion peracetic acid to a concentration of
 about 1% and deliver same to both circuits 20 and 70. ActrilTM solution can be partially pre
 diluted and then proportioned by system l0b to achieve the desired concentration.          Another
 suitable disinfectant for source 86 is sodium hypochlorite (household bleach) provided at about
five to six percent strength. Sodium hypochlorite can be used intermittently, e.g., once a week
and, is particularly useful in removing organic deposits.         System l0b can dilute sodium
hypochlorite down to a 100 to 500 parts per million ("ppm").               One source of sodium
hypochlorite is sold under the tradename Tuitol KFTM at 3.9% concentration. A further suitable
disinfectant for source 86 is sold under the tradename Sporotal     100TM,  which includes sodium
hypochlorite with potassium hydroxide and corrosion inhibitors, and which is particularly useful
in removing biofilms.
         [0060] System 10b in an embodiment rinses circuits 20 and 70 free of dialysis solution,
introduces one of the disinfectants listed above, allows the disinfectant to dwell for a specified
period of time, rinses the disinfectant out of circuits 20 and 70, and checks for residual
disinfectant prior to use. The conductivity sensors (illustrated in the referenced publications)
provided by systems 10a and l0b can be used to detect the presence or absence of disinfectant,
                                                   11

  e.g., for both bleach and peracetic acid, to ensure no disinfectant remains at the time of the next
  patient treatment. Alternatively or additionally, a residual disinfectant check can be performed
  by patient 12, nurse or caregiver using a test strip, e.g., a pH test strip, which can be specific to
  the disinfectant type. The chemical disinfectant can be performed before or during the hot water
  disinfect cycle or be performed after the hot water disinfection cycle and be followed by an
  additional hot water disinfections cycle.
           [0061] Alternatively or additionally, during the hot water disinfection cycle, small
 amounts of anhydrous sodium carbonate powder (e.g., 13 grams) can be diluted by the
 proportioning or mixing circuit of systems 10a and l0b and used as a chemical during the heat
 disinfection cycle to remove organic deposits, fats and proteins.
           [0062] Alternatively or additionally, during the hot water disinfection cycle, small
 amounts of citric acid anhydrate powder, e.g., 32 grams, can be diluted by the proportioning or
 mixing circuit of systems 10a and 10b as a chemical to disinfect and decalcify. Citric acid
 improves the disinfect efficiency because an 804C to 90'C citric acid water solution will kill
 spore forming bacteria.
           [0063] Alternatively or additionally, during the hot water disinfection cycle, citric acid
 liquid can be diluted by the proportioning or mixing circuit of systems 10a and l0b as a
 chemical to disinfect and decalcify. Again, citric acid liquid improves the disinfect efficiency
 because an 80'C to 90*C citric acid water solution will kill spore forming bacteria.
          [0064] Alternatively or additionally, during the hot water disinfection cycle, hydroxy
 acetic acid and water under the tradename DiasterilTM can be used for chemical and heat
 disinfection similar to the citric acid heat treatment.
          [0065] The heat disinfection cycle in an embodiment heats the water to 80'C to 90*C,
e.g., for fifteen minutes to one hour, and then cools circuits 20 and 70 with cool fresh water. In
further alternative autoclave embodiment, heater 78 heats water to 120'C and recirculates the
hot water/steam, e.g., for fifteen minutes to one hour, through circuits 20 and 70 before cooling
the circuits with cool fresh water.
          [0066] In an embodiment, the pump used to pump purified water through bicarbonate
cartridge 72 in Fig. 1 is used instead to pump disinfectant from source 86 in Figs. 2 and 3. The
pump used to pump acid from container 74 in Fig. I is used instead to pump peritoneal dialysis
fluid concentrate from container 88.            Disinfectant from source 86 can be provided in
concentrated form and mixed with water from purification source 60 to provide a suitable
volume of disinfection fluid, in a suitable concentration, to disinfect the entire system 10b.
         [0067] In an embodiment, disinfection source 86 is provided in a volume sized to be
used completely in one use. Control unit 50 knows the volume of disinfection source 86 and
                                                    12

  also the volume of fluid pumped by each stroke of the pod pump used to pump disinfectant from
  source 86. In this manner, control unit 50 can count full strokes of the disinfectant source pump
  and tally the amount of disinfectant pumped from the source until the full volume of disinfectant
  is removed from source 86. The disinfectant and purified water mixture is then circulated
  around and around system 10b. When chemical disinfection is completed, the disinfectant and
 purified water mixture is then pumped to drain via drain line 82, allowing system 10b to dry for
 the next treatment, which will be a peritoneal dialysis treatment.
          [0068] Alternatively or in addition to chemical disinfection, peritoneal dialysis system
  10b can use steam disinfection or ozone for sterilization.      Ozone can be created online by
 subjecting oxygen to ultraviolet light. The ozone can then be drawn into purified water in
 mixing line 62, e.g., via a venture pump. Ozone tends not to store well under positive pressure.
          [0069] Control unit 50 also knows the volume of fluid pumped by each stroke of the pod
 pump used to pump peritoneal dialysis fluid concentrate from container 88. In this manner,
 control unit 50 can count full strokes of the concentrate pump and tally the amount of
 concentrate pumped from container 88, so that the concentrate is mixed in the proper or desired
 proportion with purified water.
          [0070] Hemodialysis dialysate is made in an embodiment using conductivity probes.
 When the dialysate reads the proper concentration, the dialysate is mixed properly. Peritoneal
 dialysis fluid is proportioned instead volumetrically in one embodiment using a known volume
 of purified water from unit 60 mixed with a known volume of concentrate, the volumes being
known again by knowing the volume of each water pump stroke and each concentrate pump
stroke. In an alternative embodiment, one or more sensor is used to servo the peritoneal dialysis
fluid mixing, as is done with the hemodialysis fluid mixing. Sensors for servoing the peritoneal
dialysis fluid mixing may include conductivity sensors and/or glucose sensors.            Peritoneal
dialysis concentrate for container 88 can include any one or more of dextrose, icodextrin, amino
acids or bicarbonate. In an alternative embodiment, water purification unit 60 and concentrate
container 88 are not used and bagged, premade peritoneal dialysis fluid is used instead to feed
outer (meaning in fluid communication with the outsides of the dialyzer membranes) dialysate
circuit 70.
         [0071] Pump 64 pumps the online peritoneal dialysis fluid through heater 78 and
ultrafilter 80 and into dialyzer 40 as illustrated in Fig. 2. Ultrafilter 80 and dialyzer 40 both
serve to further purify the peritoneal dialysis ("PD") fluid before the fluid enters a PD patient
circuit 90. PD patient circuit 90 in Figs. 2 and 3 replaces blood circuit 20 in Fig. 1. Here, the
hemodialysis needles 14b and 16b are replaced by a PD connection set 100. PD connection set
100 includes a patient line 102 that connects to the PD transfer set of patient 12. The patient's
                                                 13

  PD transfer set connects to a PD catheter dwelling inside patient 12. PD connection set 100 also
  includes a leg 104 that connects fluidly to arterial line connector 14a, and a leg 106 that connects
  fluidly to venous line connector 16a. PD connection set 100 further includes a small single use
  filter 108, such as a small ultrafilter, which acts as a final barrier against any bugs or
  contaminants entering patient 12.
           [0072] Prior to connecting PD connection set 100 to arterial line connector 14a and
  venous line connector 16a, connectors 14a and 16a are connected together forming a closed loop
  that has been hot water and chemically disinfected, then dried. To-dialysate pump 64 pumps
  filtered PD fluid into PD patient circuit 90, where blood pump 30 circulates the PD fluid to push
  air through dialyzer 40 to drain via drain line 82 and open drain valve 92. When PD patient
 circuit 90 is fully primed, lines 14 and 16 are clamped, e.g., via manual pinch clamps such as
 RobertsTM clamps, connectors       4a and 16a are disconnected from each other and connected to
 PD connection set 100. Patient line 102 can have a removable hydrophobic tip or be placed at
 the same elevation as dialyzer 40, so that when lines 14 and 16 are unclamped, PD dialysate
 flows through PD connection set 100, pushing air out though patient line 102.
           [0073] Patient line 102 is then connected to the patient's transfer set and drain valve 92
 is closed. The patient can now be filled with PD dialysate as illustrated in Fig. 2. To do so in
 the illustrated embodiment, to-dialysate pump 64 pumps filtered PD fluid through venous line
 16 to patient 12, while blood pump 30 pushes filtered PD fluid through arterial line 14 to patient
 12.    Alternatively, only one of to-dialysate pump 64 or blood pump 30 pushes filtered PD to
 patient 12. It does not matter which line 14 or 16 is used to deliver PD dialysate to patient 12.
 Further alternatively, PD connection set 100 may only include one of legs 104 and 106, which
 connects to one of connectors 14a and 16a, only. The other connector 14a or 16a is plugged or
 capped after priming.
          [0074] Control unit 50 knows how much PD dialysate is delivered from primed PD
patient circuit 90 to patient 12 again by counting known volume pump strokes of one or both of
to-dialysate pump 64 or blood pump 30 in one embodiment. Once the patient's peritoneum is
filled with a prescribed fill volume, control unit 50 stops to-dialysate pump 64 and/or blood
pump 30. The PD dialysate is then allowed to reside or dwell within the patient's peritoneum
for a prescribed amount of time.
          [0075] As illustrated in Fig. 3, when the prescribed dwell period has ended, control unit
50 opens drain valve 92 and closes delivery valve 94 in fresh dialysate line 76 to perform a drain
phase. Valve 94 is open during the fill phase. To drain the patient, control unit 50 causes blood
pump 30 and/or a from-dialyzer pump 96, operating with valves 98i and 98o as has been
described herein, to pull the fill volume's worth of used PD dialysate and an expected amount of
                                                  14

   ultrafiltrate ("UF") from patient 12 and push same to drain via drain line 82. Control unit 50
   again relies on pump stroke counting for volumetric accuracy to drain patient 12.
             [0076] Control unit 50 then repeats the above-described fill, dwell and drain process, If
  patient 12 uses system 10b to perform peritoneal dialysis for multiple treatments in a row, the
  patient may have a full peritoneum from a last fill performed during a prior PD treatment when
  first connecting to PD patient circuit 90. If so, patient 12 can inform control unit 50 of same.
  Or, control unit 50 may already know that patient 12 needs to be drained and prompts the patient
  to do so. In either case, control unit 50 performs an initial drain through primed PD patient
  circuit 90 first before performing a first fill.     In an alternative embodiment, patient 12 is
  prompted to perform a manual drain and enter the drain weight into control unit 50 before
  connecting to PD patient circuit 90.
                                      HD and Continuous Flow PD
            [0077] It should be appreciated that PD system 10b is a batch PD system in which PD
  fluid is pumped to patient 12, dwells within the patient and is then removed from the patient to
  drain. Batch PD system 10b can attempt to drain all the PD fluid in the drain cycle or only a
  portion of the PD fluid in what is known as tidal flow PD. Referring now to Figs. 4 and 5,
  hemodialysis system 10a of Fig. I is used instead in any desired alternating treatment sequence
  with a continuous flow peritoneal dialysis ("CFPD") system 10c.              CFPD system 10c is
  structurally very similar to that of batch PD system IOb, so like element numbers, including all
 structure, function and alternatives discussed above in Figs. 2 and 3, are repeated and are
 included in Figs. 4 and 5.
           [0078] For the combination of systems 10a and 10c, hemodialysis takes place just like
 above with Fig. 1. Hemodialysis system 10a is hot water disinfected after treatment, and if a
 next treatment is scheduled or selected to be a PD treatment, chemical disinfectant from source
 86 can be used to additionally sterilize circuits 70 and 90. Chemical disinfectant from source 86
 is metered into purified water from unit 60 in the same manner described above for Fig. 2.
           [0079] For CFPD system 10c, batch PD connection set 100 of system 10b is replaced
with a CFPD connection set 110. CFPD connection set 110 uses dual lumens 114 and 116
instead of the "Y" or "T" connector 102, 104, 106 of batch PD connection set 100. Arterial
lumen 114 is connected removably to arterial line connector 14a of arterial line 14, while venous
lumen 116 is connected removably to venous line connector 16a of venous line 16, via the last
chance, single use filter 108 in the illustrated embodiments.       Filter 108 can again be a final
ultrafilter to remove any remaining bugs or contaminants from the PD dialysate before entering
the peritoneum of patient 12.
                                                   15

            [0080] In an embodiment, CFPD system 10c is primed just as described above in
   connection with Fig. 2, wherein arterial line connector 14a is connected to venous line connector
   16a, while CFPD connection set 110 still resides within its sterile package. Control unit 50
  causes PD dialysate to be pumped via blood pump 30 and/or to-dialyzer pump 64 until all air is
  purged from PD patient circuit 90 and pumped to drain. At that point, arterial line connector 14a
  and venous line connector 16a are disconnected from each other, CFPD connection set 110 is
  removed from its package, connected to connectors 14a and 16a, and purged, e.g., by setting the
  patient-side tips of lumens at a vertical elevation that allows gravity to fill and prime CFPD
  connection set 110. Once primed, CFPD connection set 110 is connected to the patient's PD
  transfer set, which can include dual indwelling catheters, for example, one that introduces PD
  solution at a lower end of the patient's peritoneum, and another that removes PD solution from
  an upper end of the patient's peritoneum.
           [0081] When prime is complete and patient 12 is connected to system 10c, control unit
  50 causes the CFPD circulation illustrated in Fig. 4 to take place. CFPD does not have fills,
  dwells and drains as with batch PD. Instead, CFPD acts much like hemodialysis, except that
 blood circuit 20 is replaced with PD patient circuit 90. Fresh dialysate pump 64 and spent
 dialysate pump 96 pump PD dialysate with valves 92 and 94 open through the dialysate circuit
 70 and dialyzer 40, cleaning the dialysate circulating through PD patient circuit 90 and pumping
 used dialysate to drain via drain line 82.
          [0082] At the same time, control unit 50 causes blood pump 30 to circulate PD dialysate
 around PD patient circuit 90, into patient 12 via venous line 16 and last chance filter 108, across
 the peritoneum of patient 12, out arterial line 14, and back into blood pump 30. Circulation
 through dual loops 70 and 90 is continued for a doctor-prescribed amount of time. Online PD
 dialysate is prepared as needed using purified water from unit 60 and concentrate from container
 88 as described above. CFPD typically requires a larger amount of PD dialysate than does batch
PD.
         [0083] As with batch PD system 10b, CFPD system 10c can be used with bagged
dialysate, for example, if it is desired to conserve PD dialysate usage. Here, once PD patient
circuit 90 is primed and patient 12 is connected to the PD patient circuit, control unit 50 instead
causes blood pump 30 to circulate dialysate around PD patient circuit 90 as before, but now
causes dialysate circuit valves 92 and 94 to be closed and dialysate circuit pumps 64 and 96 to
remain idle. From time to time, control unit 50 can cause dialysate circuit valves 92 and 94 to
be opened and dialysate circuit pumps 64 and 96 to be operated to replace a portion of PD
dialysate in circuit 90, which has been running through the patient's peritoneum for some time,
with new and fresh dialysate from dialysate circuit 70. This is more of a convective exchange of
                                                  16

   used dialysate with fresh dialysate as opposed to the osmotic cleaning performed when blood
   pump 30 and dialysate circuit pumps 64 and 96 are operated continuously.
           [0084] In any case, after CFPD has been performed for the prescribed time or until a
  prescribed PD fluid volume has been consumed, CFPD system is drained as illustrated in Fig. 5.
  Here, control unit 50 causes fill valve 94 to be closed and drain valve 92 to be opened. One or
  both of blood pump 30 and spent dialysate pump 96 are operated to pull used dialysate through
  one or both of arterial line 14 and venous line 16 for a number of strokes prescribed to remove
  both a fill volume plus an expected amount of UF from the patient's peritoneum. Control unit
  50 can again count known volume strokes of blood pump 30 and/or spent dialysate pump 96 to
  arrive at the prescribed removal volume. Also, as discussed above with Figs. I to 3, if PD
  treatments are performed back to back, and patient 12 in the second PD treatment arrives at
  treatment full of spent PD as is often the case, the second treatment can, after prime and patient
  connection have been completed, begin with a drain sequence controlled by control unit 50 in
  the manner just described.
                                     HD and Simplified Batch PD
          [0085] Referring now to Figs, 6 and 7, hemodialysis system 10a of Fig. I is used instead
 in any desired alternating treatment sequence with a simplified batch peritoneal dialysis system
  10d. System 10d is structurally similar to that of batch PD system 10b and CFPD system 10c,
 so like element numbers, including all structure, function and alternatives discussed above in
 Figs. 2 to 5, are repeated and are included in Figs. 6 and 7.
         [0086] For combination systems I0a and IOd, hemodialysis takes place just like above
 with Fig. 1. Hemodialysis system 10a is hot water disinfected after treatment, and if a next
 treatment is scheduled or selected to be a PD treatment, chemical disinfectant from source 86
can be used to additionally sterilize circuits 70 and 90. Chemical disinfectant from source 86 is
metered into purified water from unit 60 in the same manner described above for Fig. 2.
         [0087] For batch system 10d, batch PD connection set 100 of system 10b is replaced
with a single line connection set 120. Single line connection set 120 uses a single line and single
lumen instead of the "Y" or "T" connector 102, 104, 106 of batch PD connection set 100 or the
dual lumens of CFPD set 110. Single line connection set 120 is connected removably via last
chance, single use filter 108 to venous line connector 16a of venous line 16. Filter 108 can
again be a final ultrafilter to remove any remaining bugs or contaminants from the PD dialysate
before entering the peritoneum of patient 12.        Also different from above, a source 122 of
premade and sterilized PD dialysate is connected removably to arterial line connector 14a of
venous line 14.
                                                  17

            [0088] In an embodiment, simplified batch system 10d is primed by pumping PD
   dialysate from source 122 via blood pump 30, through arterial line 14, dialyzer 40, venous line
   16, and to an end of single line connection set 120. The end of single line connection set 120 (as
   well as the ends of sets 100 and 110) can be found either by providing a hydrophobic membrane
   at a removable tip of connection set 120 and sensing a pressure increase at blood pump 30 once
  the PD dialysate hits the hydrophobic tip. Or, the end of the single line connection set 120 (or
  sets 100 and 110) can be set at the same elevation as source 122 (or some other pressure head
  source for sets 100 and I10), so that PD dialysate that is gravity fed by opening all valves 32i,
  32o, 34i and 34o of blood pump 30 comes to rest naturally at the end of single line connection
  set 120.
            [0089] When prime is complete and patient 12 is connected to system I d as illustrated
  in Fig. 6, control unit 50 causes the batch filling to take place via known pump stroke volume
  blood pump 30. Here, dialysate valves 92 and 94 are closed, so that PD dialysate is forced
  through dialyzer 40, through venous line 16, and into the peritoneum of patient 12. The fill
 volume is measured by counting and adding the known volume pump strokes.
           [0090] Once the patient's peritoneum is filled to a prescribed fill volume, control unit 50
 stops blood pump 30. The PD dialysate is then allowed to reside or dwell within the patient's
 peritoneum for a prescribed amount of time. Batch system 10d, like system 10b, performs
 multiple fills, dwells and drains. System 10d, like batch system 10b, can perform total drains
 including expected UF, or perform partial drains and fills in a tidal peritoneal dialysis modality.
           [0091] In Fig. 7, control unit 50 causes the batch draining to take place. Here, fresh
 dialysate fluid valve 94 is closed, while spent dialysate valve 92 is opened to allow spent
 dialysate to flow through drain line 82 to a house drain or drain container. In one embodiment,
 from-dialyzer pump 96 is used to pull a prescribed amount of drain fluid, e.g., via control unit 50
counting known volume strokes of pump 96, and push the drain fluid to drain.
          [0092] Control unit 50 then repeats the above-described fill, dwell and drain process. As
before, if patient 12 uses system I0d to perform peritoneal dialysis for multiple treatments in a
row, the patient may have a full peritoneum from the prior PD treatment when first connecting
to PD patient circuit 90. If so, patient 12 can inform control unit 50 of same. Or, control unit 50
may already know that patient 12 needs to be drained and instructs the patient to do so
accordingly.     In this case, control unit 50 performs an initial drain through primed PD patient
circuit 90 first before performing a first fill. In an alternative embodiment, patient 12 performs a
manual drain and enters the drain weight into control unit 50 before connecting to PD patient
circuit 90.
                                                   18

           [0093] In an alternative draining embodiment, and assuming PD dialysate source 122
   holds a single fill volume such that the source is emptied in the fill phase of Fig. 6, control unit
   50 can instead cause blood pump 30 to pump from patient 12 back to source 122.                Here,
   dialysate valves 92 and 94 are closed, so that PD dialysate is forced through venous line 16,
  through dialyzer 40, through arterial line 14, and back into PD dialysate source 122. Dialysate
  source 122 in this embodiment is sized to hold an additional amount of UF removed from the
  patient during the drain phase.
                                  Pumping Pressures for HD versus PD
           [0094] HD typically pumps at higher pressures than does PD.            HD blood pumping
  pressures can in arterial line 14 before blood pump 30 pump be from about -50 mmHg to -300
  mmHg. Arterial needle or catheter 14b restricts the inlet to blood pump 30 and creates a slight
  vacuum. At pressures below -250 mmHg, HD system 10a may alarm for low blood flow, The
  highest pressure in blood circuit 20 occurs just after blood pump 30. Post blood pump pressure
  is dependent on blood flow rate, dialyzer 40 pressure drop, hematocrit (percentage of red blood
  cells to whole blood, which determines blood viscosity), needle size for needles 14b, 16b size,
  and any clotting in venous blood return line 16. Blood pump pressure can be 100 to 200 mmHg
 higher than the pressure in venous line 16, which can for example be 100 to 250 mmHg. The
 venous pressure will increase if venous needle 16b is pushed against the wall of the access. It is
 contemplated for system 10a to monitor venous blood pressure from 0 to 500 mmHg.
          [0095] The pressures in the dialysate circuit 70 are dependent on dialyzer type,
 ultrafiltration rate and the extracorporeal blood pressures. Typical pressure monitoring range is
 from -500 mmHg to +600 mmHg. Dialysate pressure can be different depending upon whether
the pressure is measured at the dialyzer inlet or outlet due to the pressure drop on the dialysate
side of dialyzer 40. The ultrafiltration coefficient of dialyzer 14 is also variable in the dialysate
pressure. The ultrafiltration coefficient is the number of milliliters of fluid removed per hour per
mmHg.       It is contemplated that dialysate remain positive as much as possible to prevent the
pulling of air from the dialysate solution.
          [0096] PD dialysate pumping pressures are less and can be, for example, up to three psig
positive pumping pressure and as low as -1.5 psig negative pumping pressure. Or, PD dialysate
pumping pressures can be about 78 mmHG for filling and draining. Pumping to and from the
patient's peritoneum must be done at lower pressures to prevent patient discomfort and potential
patient harm. HD pressures are higher due to the flowrates involved and having to push and pull
blood through one or more needle. It is therefore necessary that each combination of systems
10a/10b, l0a/10c and 10a/l0d be able to provide the desired operating pressures for both H-ID
and PD. Figs. 8 to 10 provide different alternatives for achieving different pump pressures for
                                                  19

   the different treatments. The alternatives for Figs. 8 to 10 apply to each combination of systems
   lOa/10b, l0a/10c and 10a/10d.
            [0097] Referring now to Fig. 8, system combinations lOa/lOb, l0a/10c and lOa/lOd can
  each employ a pneumatic pressurization system 150. Pressurization system 150 supplies the
  positive and negative air pressure to each of the pumps and possibly to each of the valves of
  system combinations iOa/10b, l0a/ Oc and 10a/10d. Pressurization system 150 is under control
  of control unit 50 of each of system combinations iOa/10b, l0a/10c and l0a/10d, and each
  dashed line in Fig. 8 corresponds to a data or electrical connection with control unit 50.
           [00983 Pressurization system 150 includes a positive air compressor 152 and a negative
  air compressor 154. Positive air compressor 152 is in pneumatic communication via pneumatic
  line 156 with a HiPos air supply tank 160 and a LoPos air supply tank 162.              Negative air
  compressor 154 is in pneumatic communication via pneumatic line 158 with a HiNeg air supply
  tank 164 and a LoNeg air supply tank 166. Positive air compressor 152 pressurizes HiPos air
  supply tank 160 to the highest positive pressure needed for HD dialysate and blood pumping.
 Positive air compressor 152 pressurizes LoPos air supply tank 162 to the highest positive
 pressure needed for PD dialysate pumping. Negative air compressor 154 evacuates HiNeg air
 supply tank 164 to the highest negative pressure needed for HD dialysate and blood pumping.
 Negative air compressor 154 evacuates LoNeg air supply tank 166 to the highest negative
 pressure needed for PD dialysate pumping.          Each of the four pressures is achieved in the
 respective tanks through feedback to control unit 50 via an electronic pressure gauge 168,
 wherein compressors 152 and 154 are operated until the corresponding pressure gauge 168
 indicates that the desired positive or negative pressure resides in the respective tank.
          [0099] Pressurization system 150 includes electrically controlled solenoid valves 170,
 172, 174 and 176 that control unit 50 opens and closes to allow HD pressure (HiPos, HiNeg) or
PD pressure (LoPos, LoNeg) to be used as needed.             If valve 170 is opened, HiPos air is
communicated via outlet line 180 with each of a plurality of pneumatic pump control valves,
which are in turn controlled via control unit 50 to selectively close the pump membranes of
pumps 30, 64 and 96 for HD. If valve 172 is opened, LoPos air is communicated instead via
outlet line 180 with each of the pneumatic pump control valves, which are in turn controlled via
control unit 50 to selectively close the pump membranes of pumps 30, 64 and 96 for PD. If
valve 174 is opened, HiNeg air is communicated via outlet line 182 with each of the pneumatic
pump control valves, which are in turn controlled via control unit 50 to selectively open the
pump membranes of pumps 30, 64 and 96 for HD.                If valve 176 is opened, LoPos air is
communicated instead via outlet line 182 with each of the pneumatic pump control valves,
                                                  20

   which are in turn controlled via control unit 50 to selectively open the pump membranes of
   pumps 30, 64 and 96 for PD.
            [00100]        In an alternative version of Fig. 8, for example if the HD and PD therapies
   each require different positive and negative pressures for different purposes, e.g., pump
   membrane versus valve membrane or dialysate pumping versus blood pumping, each of tanks
   160, 162, 164 and 166 can be set on a given day for an HD treatment or a PD treatment. Thus
  both HiPos and LoPos tanks 160 and 162 could be set on a given day for HD or PD, while both
  HiNeg and LoNeg tanks 164 and 166 are correspondingly set on the given day for HD or PD. In
  this alternative version, separate outlet lines 180 are provided for each of HiPos and LoPos tanks
   160 and 162, while separate outlet lines 182 are provided for each of HiNeg and LoNeg tanks
   164 and 166. Separate outlet lines allow for simultaneous use of different positive and negative
  pressures.
           [00101]        Referring now to Fig. 9, system combinations lOa/10b, 10a/10c and
  lOa/lOd can each alternatively employ a pneumatic pressurization system 190. Pressurization
  system 190 supplies the positive or negative air pressure to each of the pumps and possibly to
  each of the valves of system combinations lOa/10b, l0a/10c and l0a/10d. Pressurization system
  190 is likewise under control of control unit 50 of each of system combinations lOa/lOb,
  l0a/10c and 10a/10d, and each dashed line in Fig. 9 corresponds to a data or electrical
  connection with control unit 50.
           [00102]        Pressurization system 190 likewise includes a positive air compressor 152
  and a negative air compressor 154. Positive air compressor 152 is in pneumatic communication
 with a Pos air supply tank 192. Negative air compressor 154 is in pneumatic communication
 with a Neg air supply tank 194. Positive air compressor 152 pressurizes Pos air supply tank 192
 to the highest positive pressure needed that day for either for HD blood pumping, HD dialysate
 pumping or PD dialysate pumping. Negative air compressor 194 evacuates Neg air supply tank
  194 to the highest negative pressure needed that day for HD dialysate or blood pumping or PD
 dialysate pumping. Each of tank pressure is again achieved through feedback to control unit 50
 via an electronic pressure gauge 168, wherein compressors 152 and 154 are operated until the
 corresponding pressure gauge 168 indicates that the desired positive or negative pressure resides
 in the respective tank 192 or 194.
          [00103]        An electrically controlled positive pressure air regulator 196 is provided
to regulate down the pressure of the air received from positive tank 192 if needed. Thus if tank
 192 is pressurized to the positive pressure needed for HD pumping, control unit 50 could
electrically control positive pressure air regulator 196 to limit the pressure to the level needed
for PD dialysate pumping. Or, control unit 50 could electrically control positive pressure air
                                                   21

  regulator 196 to limit the pressure to the level needed for an HD pump or valve purpose needing
  less positive pressure than which resides in tank 192.         Likewise, if Neg air tank 194 is
  pressurized to the negative pressure needed for HD pumping, control unit 50 could electrically
  control negative air regulator 198 to limit the negative pressure to the level needed for PD
  dialysate pumping. Or, control unit 50 could electrically control negative air regulator 198 to
  limit the pressure to the level needed for an HD pump or valve purpose needing less positive
 pressure than which resides in tank 194.
          [001041         Downstream pressure gauges 168 are used to provide feedback to control
 unit 50, so that control unit 50 can servo air regulators 196 and 198 to achieve the desired pump
 or valve positive or negative operating pressure. While a single positive pressure air regulator
  196 is illustrated operating with positive tank 192, multiple positive pressure air regulators 196
 can be provided alternatively for different, simultaneous positive air pressure pumping or valve
 actuation. Likewise, while a single negative pressure air regulator 198 is illustrated operating
 with negative tank 194, multiple negative pressure air regulators 198 can be provided
 alternatively for different, simultaneous negative air pressure pumping or valve actuation.
          [00105]        Up until now, the focus of this application has been on the use of
 pneumatic pumps and valves. In an alternative embodiment illustrated in connection with Fig.
 10, any or more or all of pumps 30, 64 and 96 of system combinations lOa/10b, 10a/10c and
 lOa/IOd can alternatively be an electrically driven pump, such as a peristaltic tubing pump 212.
 Control unit 50 causes a roller of peristaltic tubing pump 212 to rotate clockwise in Fig. 10 to
push fluid (blood or dialysate) under positive to a destination, such as patient 12 or dialyzer 40.
 Control unit 50 causes the roller of peristaltic tubing pump 212 to rotate counterclockwise in
Fig. 10 to pull fluid (blood or dialysate) under negative pressure through line 214 from a source,
such as patient 12 or dialyzer 40.
         [00106]         Control unit 50 sets the positive and negative pumping pressures by
changing the speed of the rotation of the roller of pump 212. Downstream electronic pressure
gauges 214 and 216 provide positive and negative pressure feedback, respectively, to control
unit 50. Control unit 50 uses the pressure signal feedback to set the speed of roller pump 212 to
achieve a desired positive or negative pressure at pressure gauges 214 and 216.
         [00107]        Also until now, volumetric control of the blood and dialysate pumps has
been performed by counting and adding known volume pump strokes. It is contemplated to use
other forms of volumetric control.      First, any of system combinations 10a/0b, l0a/10c and
l0a/10d can rely alternatively on the use of balance chambers to control dialysate or blood flow
volume. Balance chambers are disclosed in the referenced publications. Fig. 10 illustrates is
similar type of metering system 220 used with peristaltic pump 212. Metering system 220
                                                  22

  includes two inlet valves 222 and 224 under control of control unit 50, two outlet valves 226 and
  228 under control of control unit 50, and a central known volume pod 230 having a diaphragm
  232 that flaps back and forth within pod 230, similar to the diaphragms or membranes located
  within pumps 30, 64 and 96.
            [00108]      Control unit 50 opens and closes valves 222 and 228 at the same time, and
  opens and closes valves 224 and 226 at the same time. Opening valve 222 allows fluid pressure
  to cause diaphragm 232 to move and expel a known volume of fluid through valve 228 to outlet
  line 234. Opening valve 224 allows fluid pressure to cause diaphragm 232 to move and expel a
  known volume of fluid through valve 226 to outlet line 234.          Fluid flow can take place
  alternatively under negative pressure from line 234, through metering system 220, to pump 212.
  By metering flow in such a way, control unit 50 knows how much fluid that roller pump 212 is
 pumping by counting how many times valves 222 to 228 are sequenced. Thus, peristaltic pump
 212 is not relied upon for pumping accuracy, but is, as discussed above controlled to achieve a
 desired positive or negative pressure at line 234.
           [00109]       While pneumatic valves could be used with electrically controlled
 peristaltic pump 212, it is also contemplated to eliminate the pneumatics altogether from any of
 the system combinations above. Here instead, electrically activated pinch or solenoid clamps or
 valves under the control of control unit 50, such as for valves 222, 224, 226 and 228, can be
 used.
          [00110]        Other forms of blood and dialysate flow volume control may be used
 alternatively or in addition to one or more of the above-described volume control methods. For
 example, one or more weigh scale in communication with control unit 50 may be used. In
 another example, a volume calculation using the ideal gas equation may be used. One such
 system and method is described in U.S. Patent No. 8,197,439, entitled, "Fluid Volume
 Determination For Medical Treatment System", the entire contents of which are incorporated
 herein by reference and relied upon.
