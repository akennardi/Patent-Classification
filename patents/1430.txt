A PROTECTIVE DEVICE FOR A WEIGHING PLATFORM
ABSTRACT
      The present invention relates to a protective device (10) for a weighing platform (1),
particularly for weighing animals, the weighing platform (1) comprising a weighing plate that
defines two longitudinal ends, wherein at each of the plate (2) ends a protective device (10) is
arranged, which, when projected in side view, defines an L-shaped profile (11), the profile (11)
comprising a lower end (12) that defines a base for supporting the protective device (10) and an
upper end (13) that is mounted near end of the plate (12) of the weighing platform (1), being
capable of barring dirt brought by the animals, preventing the accumulation of residues/debris
under the platform (1), which might entail problems in the precision of the weighing or even lead
to locking of the platform (10).

A PROTECTIVE DEVICE FOR A WEIGHING PLATFORM
[0001] The present invention relates to a protective device for a weighing platform disclosed in
patent application BR 10 2015 026489-5.
Description of the Prior Art
[0002] Weighing platforms are devices that optimize the weighing of animals. Weighing
platforms generally accommodate weighing bars that are positioned under its structures and are
applied in various areas, including in the cattle-breading branch, where often there is the need to
weigh animals with precision and in large numbers. Therefore, it is necessary to employ robust,
precise and durable equipment.
[0003] Due to the different places where weighing platforms are applied, for example, in the
open field, exposed to rainwater and mud, there is a need to have an easy-to-maintain-and-clean
assembly
[0004] One does not observe, in the prior art, a weighing platform that comprises at least one
protection device arranged at each of its longitudinal ends, capable of barring the dirt deposited
on the platform, preventing the accumulation of residues/debris under the platform, which might
entail problems in the precision weighing, or even lead to equipment locking.
Objectives of the Invention
[0005] The objective lies in providing a protective device for a weighing platform, which is
arranged at the longitudinal ends of the platform and is capable of barring dirt during the
weighing of animals, preventing accumulation of residues/debris under the platform.
Brief Description of the Invention
[0006] The objectives of the present invention are achieved by means of a protective device for
a weighing platform, which comprises a weighing plate, which defines two longitudinal ends,
wherein at each of the plate ends a protective device is provides, which, when projected in side
view, defines an L-shaped profile, the profile comprising a lower end that defines a horizontal

                                                2
base for the protective device and an upper base that is mounted near the end of the plate of the
weighing platform.
Brief Description of the Drawing
[0007] The present invention will now be described in greater detail with reference to the
drawings. The figures show:
[0008] Figure 1 - a perspective view of the weighing platform comprising the protective device
of the invention; and
[0009] Figure 2 - a side view of the weighing platform comprising the protective device of the
invention.
Detailed Description of the Figures
[0010] With reference to the drawings, one observes, in figure 1, a weighing platform 1
comprising a weighing plate 2 that defines two longitudinal ends, each of the ends being
supported on a bar 3 and comprising a protective device 10.
[0011] In figure 2 one observes the supportive device 10 of the present model, which, when
projected in side view, defines an L-shaped profile 11 and is arranged at one of the longitudinal
ends of the platform 1.
[0012] The profile 11 comprises a lower end 12 defining a horizontal base for supporting the
protective device 10 and an upper end 13 that is mounted near the end of the plate 2, defining a
minimum space sufficient to enable movement of the plate 2 with respect to the protective
device 10.
[0013] The protective device 10 is manufactured from a metallic or polymeric material,
depending on the need of the environment and design. The thicknesses, widths and heights of
the protective device 10 vary according to the design of the weighing platform 1.
[0014] The protective device 10 has the objective of barring dirt brought by the animals during
the weighing, preventing the accumulation of residues/debris under the platform 1. It is

                                                 3
important that such accumulation of dirt be prevented, since it might entail problems in the
precision of the weighing or even result in locking the platform 1.
