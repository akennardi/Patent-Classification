Description
SYSTEM FOR CONTROLLING OPERATION OF A MACHINE
Technical Field
[0001]      The present disclosure generally relates to a system for controlling operation of a
machine. More particularly, the present disclosure relates to a system that selectively controls
operation of a machine on the basis of door movements that are recorded and a state of a key
switch present in the machine.
Background
[0002]      Machines that are used in the construction field typically employ various measures in
their operational schema to avoid risks to operating personnel as well as personnel located in the
vicinity of such machines. For instance, U.S Patent 8,204,611 discloses a machine that includes
a master electronic control module and at least one secondary electronic control module. A
method for operating the machine includes the steps of: determining whether preconditions are
satisfied for changing the master electronic control module from an operating state to a low
power state, and determining whether preconditions are satisfied for changing the secondary
electronic control module from an operating state to a power off state by opening a power supply
circuit. The method also includes steps of changing the secondary electronic control module
from the operating state to the power off state, and changing the master electronic control
module from the operating state to the low power state.
[0003]      However, manufacturers of constructional machines are nevertheless endeavoring to
integrate various other types of measures in the operational schema of the machines in order to
provide increased risk avoidance to the operating personnel and also to personnel located in the
vicinity of such machines.
Summary of the Disclosure
[0004]      In one aspect of the present disclosure, a system for controlling operation of a machine
includes a door switch that is communicably coupled to a door of the machine, a door switch
control module (DCM) that is communicably coupled to the door switch, and an Electronic
Control Module (ECM) that is communicably coupled to the door switch and the DCM. The

                                                 -2
door switch is configured to generate signals on the basis of the door being moved in at least one
of: from an open position to a closed position, or from the closed position to the open position.
The DCM monitors signals from the door switch and is configured to selectively wake-up the
ECM for an amount of time in response to the door being moved in at least one of: from the open
position to the closed position, or from the closed position to the open position.
[0005]     In another aspect of the present disclosure, a computer-implemented method for
controlling operation of a machine includes monitoring movement in a door of the machine from
an open position to a closed position, and from the closed position to the open position. The
method further includes selectively waking-up an Electronic Control Module (ECM) of the
machine in response to the door being moved: from the open position to the closed position, and
from the closed position to the open position. The method further includes maintaining the ECM
in the wake-up state for an amount of time; and activating a sleep state of the ECM if no door
movement is detected by the door switch within the amount of time.
[0006]     In yet another aspect of the present disclosure, a non-transitory computer-readable
medium is provided. The non-transitory computer-readable medium has sequences of instruction
stored thereon that when executed by a computer-based system causes the computer-based
system to perform operations as outlined herein. The instructions when executed by the
computer based system cause the computer-based system to monitor a movement in a door of the
machine i.e., movement of the door from an open position to a closed position, and from the
closed position to the open position. The instructions when executed by the computer-based
system also cause the computer-based system to selectively wake-up an Electronic Control
Module (ECM) of the machine in response to the door being moved: from the open position to
the closed position, and from the closed position to the open position; and then maintain the
ECM in the wake-up state for an amount of time. Thereafter, if no door movement is detected by
the door switch within the amount of time, the instructions when processed by the computer
based system cause the computer-based system to activate a sleep state of the ECM.
[0007]     Other features and aspects of this disclosure will be apparent from the following
description and the accompanying drawings.

[0016]      The detailed description of exemplary embodiments of the disclosure herein makes
reference to the accompanying drawings and figures, which show the exemplary embodiments
by way of illustration only. While these exemplary embodiments are described in sufficient
detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the disclosure, it should be understood that
other embodiments may be realized and that logical and mechanical changes may be made

applications. Thus, the detailed description herein is presented for purposes of illustration only
and not of limitation. For example, the steps recited in any of the method or process descriptions
may be executed in any order and are not limited to the order presented.
[0017]      For the sake of brevity, conventional data networking, application development and
other functional aspects of the systems (and components of the operating systems) may not be
described in detail herein. Furthermore, the connecting lines shown in the various figures
contained herein are intended to represent exemplary functional relationships and/or
physical/communicative couplings between the various elements. It should be noted that many
alternative or additional functional relationships or physical/communicative connections may be
present in a practical system.
[0018]      The present disclosure is described herein with reference to system architecture, block
diagrams and flowchart illustrations of methods, and computer program products according to
various aspects of the disclosure. It will be understood that each functional block of the block
diagrams, the flowchart illustrations, and combinations of functional blocks in the block
diagrams, the flowchart illustrations, and combinations of functional blocks in the block
diagrams, respectively, can be implemented by computer program instructions.
[0019]      These computer program instructions may be loaded onto a general purpose computer,
special purpose computer, or other programmable data processing apparatus to produce a
machine, such that the instructions that execute on the computer or other programmable data
processing apparatus create means for implementing the functions specified in the flowchart
block or blocks. These computer program instructions may also be stored in a computer
readable memory that can direct a computer or other programmable data processing apparatus to

                                                  -5
function in a particular manner, such that the instructions stored in the computer-readable
memory produce output/s that implement the function specified in the flowchart block or blocks.
The computer program instructions may also be loaded onto a computer or other programmable
data processing apparatus to cause a series of operational steps to be performed on the computer
or other programmable apparatus to produce a computer-implemented process such that the
instructions which execute on the computer or other programmable apparatus provide steps for
implementing the functions specified in the flowchart block or blocks.
[0020]      Accordingly, functional blocks of the block diagrams and flow diagram illustrations
support combinations of means for performing the specified functions, combinations of steps for
performing the specified functions, and program instruction means for performing the specified
functions. It will also be understood that each functional block of the block diagrams and
flowchart illustrations, and combinations of functional blocks in the block diagrams and
flowchart illustrations, can be implemented by either special purpose hardware-based computer
systems which perform the specified functions or steps, or suitable combinations of special
purpose hardware and computer instructions. It should be further appreciated that the multiple
steps as illustrated and described as being combined into a single step for the sake of simplicity
may be expanded into multiple steps. In other cases, steps illustrated and described as single
process steps may be separated into multiple steps but have been combined for simplicity.
[0021]      It may be further noted that references in the specification to "one embodiment", "an
embodiment", "an example embodiment", etc., indicate that the embodiment described may
include a particular feature, structure, or characteristic, but every embodiment may not
necessarily include the particular feature, structure, or characteristic. Moreover, such phrases are
not necessarily referring to the same embodiment. Further, when a particular feature, structure,
or characteristic is described in connection with an embodiment, it would be within the
knowledge of one skilled in the art to affect such feature, structure, or characteristic in
connection with other embodiments whether or not explicitly described.
[0022]      The systems, methods and computer program products disclosed in conjunction with
various embodiments of the present disclosure are embodied in systems, modules, and methods
for controlling operation of a machine. Specific nomenclature used herein is merely exemplary
and only used for descriptive purposes. Hence, such nomenclature must not be construed as
being limiting of the scope of the present disclosure.

                                                   -6
[0023]     The present disclosure is now described in more detail herein in terms of the above
disclosed exemplary embodiments of system, methods, processes and computer program
products. This is for convenience only and is not intended to limit the application of the present
disclosure. In fact, after reading the following description, it will be apparent to one skilled in
the relevant art(s) how to implement the following disclosure in alternative embodiments.
[0024]     With reference to FIG. 1, an exemplary machine 100 is depicted, in which
embodiments of the present disclosure may be implemented. As shown, the machine 100 is
embodied in the form of a Load Haul Dumper (LHD). The machine 100 may be used in a
variety of applications including mining, quarrying, road construction, construction site
preparation, etc. For example, the LHD of the present disclosure may be employed for hauling
earth materials such as ore, soil, debris, or other naturally occurring deposits from a worksite.
[0025]     Although the exemplary machine 100 is embodied as a LHD in the illustrated
embodiment of FIG. 1, it will be appreciated that the other types of machines such as, for e.g.,
but not limited to, shovels, diggers, buckets, hydraulic excavators, motor graders, and the like
can be optionally used in lieu of the LHD disclosed herein to implement the embodiments of the
present disclosure. Moreover, in alternative embodiments of the present disclosure, the machine
100 can optionally be embodied in the form of a manually operated machine, an autonomous
machine, or a machine that is operable in both manual and autonomous mode. Therefore,
notwithstanding any particular configuration of machine disclosed in this document, it may be
noted that embodiments disclosed herein can be similarly applied to other types of machines
without deviating from the spirit of the present disclosure.
[0026]     As shown in FIG. 1, the machine 100 may include a drive system 102, a transmission
system 104, an articulated steering system 105, an articulation system 106, a work implement
108 for e.g., a bucket, and multiple ground engaging members for e.g., wheels 110. The drive
system 102 may include an engine (not shown), an electric motor for e.g., a traction motor (not
shown), or both depending on specific requirements of an application. The transmission system
104 may include gears, differential systems, axles, and other components (not shown) that are
coupled to the drive system 102 and the wheels 110 of the machine 100. The transmission
system 104 is configured to transfer power from the drive system 102 to the wheels 110 and
hence, propel the machine 100 on a work surface 112.

                                                  -7
[0027]      The articulated steering system 105 allows the wheels 1 10a to accomplish steering of
the machine 100 relative to the wheels 11 Ob. Moreover, the articulation system 106 disclosed
herein may include linkages 114 that are coupled to the drive system 102 and the work
implement 108. The articulation system 106 allows articulation of the work implement 108
during operation so that the work implement 108 can operatively perform functions such as, but
not limited to, hauling and dumping materials relative to the work surface 112.
[0028]      The machine 100 also includes a cab 116 having a door 118. The door 118 is
configured to allow access to an operator for entering and exiting the cab 116. As such, the cab
116 is sized and shaped to house an operator of the machine 100. Moreover, the cab 116
includes control implements (not shown) that are operable for controlling a working of the
machine 100. Still further, the cab 116 may include a key switch module 120 disposed therein.
The key switch module 120 is operable for activating the drive system 102, the transmission
system 104, the articulated steering system 105, and/or the articulation system 106 of the
machine 100, and for rendering the machine 100 in an operational state subject to embodiments
of the present disclosure, explanation to which will be made later in this document. In one
example, the key switch module 120 can be operable, for e.g., by way of a physical key (not
shown) that co-operates with the key switch module 120, or by receiving an operator input at the
key switch module 120.
[0029]      The present disclosure relates to a system 200 for controlling operation of the machine
100. Referring to FIG. 2, a schematic representation of the system 200 is illustrated. The system
200 includes a door switch 202 that is communicably coupled to the door 118 of the machine
100. The door switch 202 is configured to generate signals SI on the basis of the door 118 being
moved: from an open position to a closed position, and from the closed position to the open
position. For example, if an operator moves the door 118 from the closed position to the open
position for accessing the cab 116, the door switch 202 records the movement of the door 118 as
being opened and generates a first signal SI that is indicative of the door 118 being opened. In
another example, upon gaining access to the cab 116, if the operator moves shuts the door 118
i.e., moves the door 118 from the open position to the closed position, the door switch 202
records the closing movement of the door 118 and accordingly generates a second signal SI that
is indicative of the door 118 being closed.

                                                  -8
[0030]      In an embodiment of this disclosure, the door switch 202 may be embodied in the
form of a contact-type switch i.e., using contact with the door 118 as a means to detect
movement of the door 118 from closed to open position, or open to closed position. In another
embodiment, the door switch 202 may be of a non-contact type for e.g., using Hall-effect sensors
for detecting movement of the door 118 from closed to open position, and open to closed
position. Although a contact-type and a non-contact type switch are disclosed herein, one of
ordinary skill the art can contemplate using any type of door switch 202 to perform functions that
are consistent with the present disclosure. Therefore, a type and/or nature of the door switch 202
is merely exemplary in nature and hence, non-limiting of this disclosure. Any type of door
switch 202 known in the art may be used without deviating from the spirit of the present
disclosure.
[0031]      The system 200 further includes a door switch control module (DCM) 204, and an
Electronic Control Module (ECM) 206. The DCM 204 is communicably coupled to the door
switch 202 while the ECM 206 is communicably coupled to the door switch 202 and the DCM
204. Further, the ECM 206 is beneficially coupled to the drive system 102, the transmission
system 104, the articulated steering system 105, and the articulation system 106 of the machine
100. The DCM 204 monitors signals SI generated by the door switch 202 as a result of the door
118 being opened or closed. The DCM 204 is further configured to selectively wake-up the
ECM 206 for an amount of time T in response to the door 118 being moved from the open
position to the closed position, and from the closed position to the open position. The DCM 204,
disclosed herein may include various software and/or hardware components that are configured
to perform functions consistent with the present disclosure. Explanation pertaining to the DCM
204 will be made later in this document.
[0032]      As shown in the illustrated embodiment of FIG. 2, the system 200 further includes a
display module 208 that is communicably coupled to the ECM 206. The display module 208
may be embodied in the form of one or more interfaces (not shown) allowing the operator of the
machine 100 to visually, aurally, and/or haptic-ally know an operating state of the machine 100
and accordingly, control an operation of the machine 100 using such interfaces. As shown in
FIG. 2, the display module 208 can also communicably coupled to the DCM 204 for executing
functions that will be described later in this document.

                                                 -9
[0033]      In an embodiment of the present disclosure, the ECM 206 switches "ON" the display
module 208 for the amount of time T on the basis of the door 118 being moved from the open
position to the closed position. For instance, if the door 118 has been moved by the operator
from the open position to the closed position after gaining access into the cab 116, the DCM 204
first wakes-up the ECM 206 which in turn may switch "ON" the display module 208. Although
it is disclosed herein that the ECM 206 is configured to switch "ON" the display module 208, in
an alternative embodiment of this disclosure, it can be contemplated to configure the DCM 204
in lieu of the ECM 206 to perform the function of switching "ON" the display module 208. As
such, the DCM 204 is also beneficially disposed in communication with the display module 208,
as shown in the illustrated embodiment of FIG. 2.
[0034]      The amount of time T disclosed herein may be regarded as a maximum period of time
within which at least one door movement i.e., opening or closing of the door 118 should ideally
be recorded at the door switch 202 by the DCM 204. In various embodiments of the present
disclosure, this pre-defined amount of time T could lie in the range of approximately 10 seconds
to 5 minutes. For example, in an application, the amount of time T may be set to a minute i.e., 1
minute. In another application, the amount of time T may be set to 2 minutes. In yet another
example, the amount of time T may be set to 30 seconds. However, one of ordinary skill in the
art can contemplate setting the amount of time T to any value depending on specific
requirements of an application without deviating from the spirit of the present disclosure.
[0035]      In an embodiment of this disclosure, if no door movement is detected at the door
switch 202 within the amount of time T, the ECM 206 generates a sleep request signal to the
DCM 204. In response to the sleep request signal generated by the ECM 206, the DCM 204 can
de-activate i.e., switch "OFF" the ECM 206 and the display module 208. As the ECM 206 is
beneficially coupled to the drive system 102, the transmission system 104, the articulated
steering system 105, and the articulation system 106 of the machine 100, switching "OFF" the
ECM 206 can disable the drive system 102, the transmission system 104, the articulated steering
system 105, and the articulation system 106 of the machine 100 and hence, render the machine
100 in a non-operational state.
[0036]      As shown in the illustrated embodiment of FIG. 2, the system 200 further includes a
key switch 210 that is communicably coupled to the ECM 206 and the key switch module 120 of
the machine 100. The ECM 206 is configured to receive a key input signal S2 from the key

                                                 -10
switch 210 upon actuation of the key switch module 120 for e.g., when the key switch module
120 is turned "ON" or "OFF" with the help of a physical key (not shown), or when the key
switch module 120 receives an operator input.
[0037]     In an embodiment, the ECM 206 further performs diagnostic functions on the DCM
204 and the door switch 202 in response to the door 118 being currently disposed in the closed
position as determined by the ECM 206; and upon receipt of a key input signal S2 that is
indicative of the key switch module 120 being turned "ON". The diagnostic functions disclosed
herein can be regarded as including functions such as, but limited to, monitoring integrity of the
door switch 202 and the DCM 204. For example, if the door switch 202 or the DCM 204 has
been tampered with so as to cause any hindrance to an operational regime of the door switch 202
and/or the DCM 204, then the ECM 206 can record such instances to disable the drive system
102, the transmission system 104, the articulated steering system 105, and/or the articulation
system 106 of machine 100 and hence, render the machine 100 in a non-operational state. As
such, the ECM 206 is configured to allow machine movement in response to the door 118 being
currently disposed in the closed position (as determined by the ECM 206); and upon receipt of a
key input signal S2 that is indicative of the key switch module 120 being turned "ON".
[0038]     However, if the door switch 202 generates a signal SI indicative of the door 118 being
in the open position and the key input signal S2 from the key switch 210 is indicative of the key
switch module 120 being turned "ON", then the ECM 206 disables the drive system 102, the
transmission system 104, the articulated steering system 105, and/or the articulation system 106
of the machine 100 so as to render the machine 100 in a non-operational state. Therefore, in
various embodiments of the present disclosure, the ECM 206 prevents the operator from
operating the machine 100 (i.e., by disabling the drive system 102, the transmission system 104,
the articulated steering system 105, and the articulation system 106 of the machine 100) when
the door 118 is left open and the key switch module 120 is turned "ON". As disclosed earlier
herein, the open position of the door 118 can be determined by the ECM 206 from the signal SI
generated at the door switch 202, and the "ON" state of the key switch module 120 can be
determined from the key input signal S2 generated by the key switch 210.
[0039]     FIG. 3 is an exemplary low level implementation 300 of a portion of the system 200 of
FIG. 2 for controlling operation of the exemplary machine 100 of FIG. 1 in accordance with
embodiments of the present disclosure. For the sake of simplicity in this document, the low level

                                                   -11
implementation 300 of a portion of the system 200 will hereinafter be referred to as 'the system'
and designated with identical reference numeral '300'). Referring to the system 300 of FIG. 3,
the system 300 includes a first relay 304, a second relay 306, and a pair of Darlington transistors
310, 312. The system 300 also includes a first capacitor 314 and a second capacitor 316. The
first capacitor 314 is located between the first relay 304 and a first Darlington transistor 310
while the second capacitor 316 is located between the first relay 304 and a second Darlington
transistor 312. Moreover, the first capacitor 314 and the first Darlington transistor 310 are
disposed in parallel to the second capacitor 316 and the second Darlington transistor 312
respectively. The system 300 as disclosed in FIG. 3 may include various additional components
other than illustrated and described above, and explanation to such additional components has
been willfully omitted for the sake of brevity in this document, and also for the sake of simplicity
in understanding the present disclosure.
[0040]       Although not shown in FIG. 3, the system 300 may include and be in operable
communication with the door switch 202. During operation, the door switch 202 generates a
signal SI indicative of the door 118 being in the open position or in the closed position. If the
door 118 is in the closed position, then the door switch 202 energizes the first relay 304 so as to
take up a first operational state. When in the first operational state, pulse voltage from the first
relay 304 may be communicated to the first Darlington transistor 310 via the first capacitor 314
and subsequently to the second relay 306 so as to position the second relay 306 in the first
operational state i.e., a wake-up state. The second relay 306 in turn wakes-up the ECM 206.
Alternatively, when the door 118 has been moved into the closed position, the first relay 304
could communicate the pulse voltage to the second Darlington transistor 312 via the second
capacitor 316 and subsequently to the second relay 306 so as to position the second relay 306 in
the first operational state i.e., a wake-up state.
[0041]       However, if the door 118 is in the open position and has been left un-attended for the
amount of time T (i.e., no further door movement has been recorded at the door switch 202 for
the amount of time T), or if there has been no actuation of the key switch module 120 within the
amount of time T (i.e., no key input signal S2 from the key switch 210 within the amount of time
T), then the ECM 206 (See FIG. 2) latches the second relay 306 into a second operational state
i.e., a sleep mode. The second relay 306 can then cause a sleep mode to be implemented at the
ECM 206.

components, modules, and various processing steps. It should be appreciated that such
functional blocks may be realized by any number of hardware and/or software components
configured to perform the specified functions. For example, system 200 may employ various
integrated circuit components, e.g., memory elements, processing elements, logic elements, look
up tables, and/or the like, which may carry out a variety of functions under the control of one or
more microprocessors or other control devices. Similarly, the software elements of the system
200 may be implemented with any programming or scripting language such as C, C++, Java,
COBOL, assembler, PERL, Visual Basic, SQL Stored Procedures, extensible markup language
(XML), with the various algorithms being implemented with any combination of data structures,
objects, processes, routines or other programming elements. Further, it should be noted that the
system 200 may employ any number of conventional techniques for data transmission, signaling,
data processing, network control, and/or the like. Still further, the system 200 could be
configured to detect or prevent security issues with a user-side scripting language, such as
JavaScript, VBScript or the like. In an embodiment of the present disclosure, the networking
architecture between components of the system 200, for e.g., between the DCM 204 and the
ECM 206 of system 200 may be implemented by way of a client-server architecture. In an
embodiment of the present disclosure, the client-server architecture may be built on a
customizable.Net (dot-Net) platform. However, it may be apparent to a person ordinarily skilled
in the art that various other software frameworks may be utilized to build the client-server
architecture between components of the system 200 for e.g., between the DCM 204 and the ECM
206 without departing from the spirit and scope of the disclosure.
[0043]      These software elements may be loaded onto a general purpose computer, special
purpose computer, or other programmable data processing apparatus to produce a machine, such
that the instructions that execute on the computer or other programmable data processing
apparatus create means for implementing the functions specified in the flowchart block or
blocks. These computer program instructions may also be stored in a computer-readable
memory that can direct a computer or other programmable data processing apparatus to function
in a particular manner, such that the instructions stored in the computer-readable memory
produce instructions which implement the function specified in the flowchart block or blocks.
The computer program instructions may also be loaded onto a computer or other programmable
data processing apparatus to cause a series of operational steps to be performed on the computer
or other programmable apparatus to produce a computer-implemented process such that the

thereof) may be implemented using hardware, software or a combination thereof, and may be
implemented in one or more computer systems or other processing systems. However, the
manipulations performed by the present disclosure were often referred to in terms such as
monitoring, detecting, determining, comparing, or checking, which are commonly associated
with mental operations performed by a human operator. No such capability of a human operator
is necessary, or desirable in most cases, in any of the operations described herein, which form a
part of the present disclosure. Rather, the operations are machine operations. Useful machines
for performing the operations in the present disclosure may include general-purpose digital
computers or similar devices.
[0045]      In fact, in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure, the present

electromagnetic, optical or other signals capable of being received by communication interface
424. Signals 426 may be provided to communication interface 424 via a communication path
(e.g., channel) 428. Communication path 428 carries signals 426 and may be implemented using
wire or cable, fiber optics, a telephone line, a cellular link, a radio frequency (RF) link and other
communication channels.
[0051]      In this document, the terms "computer program medium" and "computer usable

implemented using a software, the software may be stored in a computer program product and
loaded into computer system 400 using removable storage drive 416, hard disk drive 414 or
communication interface 424. The control logic (software), when executed by processor 402,
causes processor 402 to perform the functions of the present disclosure as described herein.

Industrial Applicability
[0058]     FIG. 5 is a flowchart illustrating a computer implemented method 500 for controlling
operation of the exemplary machine 100, according to an embodiment of the present disclosure.
[0059]     At step 502, the method 500 includes monitoring movement in the door 118 of the
machine 100 from the open position to the closed position, and from the closed position to the
open position. At step 504, the method 500 further includes selectively waking-up the Electronic
Control Module (ECM) 206 in response to the door 118 being moved from the open position to
the closed position, or from the closed position to the open position. At step 506, the method
500 further includes maintaining the ECM 206 in the wake-up state for an amount of time T. At
step 508, the method 500 further includes activating a sleep state of the ECM 206 if no door
movement is detected by the door switch 202 within the amount of time T. As disclosed earlier
herein, in various embodiments, the amount of time T can lie in the range of approximately 10
seconds to 5 minutes. For example, in an application, the amount of time T could be set to 2
minutes. However, as disclosed earlier herein, the amount of time T could be set to any value
depending on specific requirements of an application.
[0060]     In an aspect of the present disclosure, the method 500 further includes selectively
switching "ON" the display module 208 of the machine 100 for the amount of time T on the
basis of the door 118 being moved from the open position to the closed position.
[0061]     In another aspect of the present disclosure, the method 500 further includes receiving
the key input signal S2 from the key switch 210 upon actuation of the key switch module 120 of
the machine 100 at the ECM 206.
[0062]     If the door 118 is currently disposed in the closed position, as determined by the DCM
204; and if the key switch 210 generates a key input signal S2 that is indicative of the key switch
module 120 being turned "ON" to the ECM 206, then the ECM 206 allows movement of the
machine 100 i.e., allows movement or operation of the drive system 102, the transmission system

                                                  -17
104, the articulated steering system 105, and the articulation system 106. Moreover, the ECM
206 proceeds to perform diagnostic functions on the DCM 204 and the door switch 202 to verify
or determine the integrity of the DCM 204 and the door switch 202. As disclosed earlier herein,
diagnostic functions could include checking whether the door switch 202 or the DCM 204 has
been tampered with so as to cause hindrance in the operation of the door switch 202 or the DCM
204, or to cause inadvertent or incorrect operation of the machine 100 itself.
[0063]      FIG. 6 illustrates a low level process flowchart 600 showing steps 602-640 in an
exemplary implementation of the present disclosure, pursuant to the method 500 of FIG. 5. As
such, the process flowchart 600 of FIG. 6 also outlines the logic flow with which the system 200
of the present disclosure can operate for controlling operation of the machine 100. However,
while explaining the process 600 illustrated in FIG. 6, some aspects of the foregoing disclosure
may be recapitulated or omitted for the purposes of better understanding of the present disclosure
or for the sake of brevity in the present document. However, it should be noted that such
explanation should not be construed as being limiting of this disclosure, rather the explanation
pertaining to FIG. 6 should be taken merely in the illustrative and explanatory sense only. The
exact scope of the present disclosure is defined by the claims appended herein.
[0064]      Referring to FIG. 6, the process 600 is shown to initiate with a start step 602. At step
604, the DCM 204 determines if any movement of the door 118 has been detected by the door
switch 202. If no door movement has been detected, the process 600 proceeds to step 606 where
the DCM 204 continues to maintain the ECM 206 in the sleep state. Thereafter, the process 600
terminates at step 608.
[0065]      However, if at step 604, the DCM 204 determines that door movement has been
detected by the door switch 202, then the process 600 proceeds to step 610 where the DCM 204
further determines from the door switch 202 whether the door 118 has been opened or closed. If
the door 118 has been opened, then the process 600 proceeds to step 612 where the DCM 204
wakes-up the ECM 206 for the amount of time T. Thereafter, the process 600 proceeds to step
614, where the DCM 204 determines if any further door movement has been recorded at the door
switch 202 within the amount of time T. At step 614, if door movement has been detected within
the amount of time T i.e., if the door 118 has been closed within the amount of time T, then the
process 600 proceeds to step 624b where the ECM 206 switches "ON" the display module 208
for the amount of time T. Moreover, as shown at step 624c, the ECM 206 also resets its timer to

                                                 -18
a start of the amount of time T i.e., at 0 seconds of the amount of time T or no lapse of time from
within the amount of time T.
[0066]      However, if at step 610, the DCM 204 has determined that the door switch 202 has
recorded a door movement from open to closed position, then the process 600 directly proceeds
from step 610 to step 624a in which the DCM 204 wakes-up the ECM 206 for the amount of
time T, while the ECM 206 switches "ON" the display module 208 for the amount of time T (see
step 624b). As shown at step 624c, the ECM 206 also resets its timer to a start of the amount of
time T i.e., at 0 seconds of the amount of time T or no lapse of time from within the amount of
time T. In various aspects of the present disclosure, it should be noted that the steps 624a, 624b,
and 624c may occur in a substantially simultaneous manner or in a tandem manner without
limiting the scope of the present disclosure.
[0067]      The process 600 then proceeds from step 624c to step 630 in which the ECM 206
makes a determination as to whether the key switch module 120 has been turned "ON" within
the amount of time T. If the key switch module 120 has been turned "ON" within the amount of
time T, then the process 600 proceeds to step 632 in which the ECM 206 allows an operation of
the machine 100, i.e., the ECM 206 allows operation of the drive system 102, the transmission
system 104, the articulated steering system 105, and the articulation system 106 of the machine
100. Moreover, the process 600 further proceeds to step 638 wherein the ECM 206 performs
diagnostic functions on the door switch 202 and the DCM 204. For example, the ECM 206 may
perform diagnostic functions on the door switch 202 and the DCM 204 to check or verify the
integrity of the door switch 202 and the DCM 204. The process 600 then terminates at step 640.
[0068]      In an embodiment, if at step 630, the key switch module 120 has not been turned on
within the amount of time T, then the proceeds from step 630 to step 616 wherein the ECM 206
sends a sleep request signal to the DCM 204. Upon receipt of the sleep request signal by the
DCM 204 at step 618, the DCM 204 puts the ECM 206 in a sleep state so as to render the
machine 100 non-operational. Moreover, as shown at step 620, the DCM 204 or the ECM 206
switches "OFF" the display module 208. The process 600 then terminates at step 622.
[0069]      Alternatively, if the key switch module 120 has been turned "ON" after a
lapse/completion of the amount of time T as shown at step 634, then the process 600 could
proceed to step 636 in which the DCM 204 further determines if the door 118 has been closed. It

                                                   -19
can be assumed that at this point, the ECM 206 is in a sleep state upon completion of the amount
of time T. Moreover, as the DCM 204 monitors signals SI from the door switch 202 (that are
indicative of the closing and opening of the door 118), if the door movement last recorded at the
door switch 202 is that of the door 118 being closed, then the DCM 204 receives the signal SI
indicative of the door 118 closure from the door switch 202 and wakes-up the ECM 206.
Thereafter, the ECM 206 allows an operation of the machine 100 as shown at step 632, i.e., the
ECM 206 allows operation of the drive system 102, the transmission system 104, the articulated
steering system 105, and the articulation system 106 of the machine 100. The process 600 then
proceeds to step 638 wherein the ECM 206 performs diagnostic functions on the door switch 202
and the DCM 204. For example, the ECM 206 may perform diagnostic functions on the door
switch 202 and the DCM 204 to check or verify the integrity of the door switch 202 and the
DCM 204. The process 600 then terminates at step 640.
[0070]      Embodiments of the present disclosure have applicability for use and implementation
in controlling an operation of a machine. It has been seen that in many cases, operators of
machines may sometimes inadvertently operate the machine with the door of the machine being
left in the open position. In some other cases, personnel located in the vicinity of the machine,
for e.g., near the articulation hitch area of load haul dumpers, may open the door when the
machine is in an operating state. Such instances may pose a risk to the operating personnel
and/or the personnel located in the vicinity of the machine. However, with implementation of
the system 200 disclosed herein, the machine may be disabled with immediate effect upon
detecting that the door is in the open position.
[0071]      Moreover, operators may sometimes tamper with the door switch for the sake of
convenience thereby overriding protocols or measures. In such cases, the system 200 of the
present disclosure also performs diagnostic functions on the door switch to ensure that any
tampering of the door switch is detected and that machine operation is immediately disabled.
Therefore, with use of embodiments disclosed herein, operators are prevented from operating the
machine when there is a risk to the operating personnel as well as personnel located in the
vicinity of the machine. Use of embodiments disclosed herein can thus help operators to ensure
that risk avoidance measures are adhered to when operating the machine in a worksite.
[0072]      While aspects of the present disclosure have been particularly shown and described
with reference to the embodiments above, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that

                                            -20
various additional embodiments may be contemplated by the modification of the disclosed
machines, systems and methods without departing from the spirit and scope of what is disclosed.
Such embodiments should be understood to fall within the scope of the present disclosure as
determined based upon the claims and any equivalents thereof.
