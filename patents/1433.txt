   DETAILED DESCRIPTION
20 [0056]         For the purposes of promoting an understanding of the principals of the
   invention, reference will now be made to the embodiments illustrated in the drawings,
   which are described below. The embodiments disclosed below are not intended to be
   exhaustive or limit the invention to the precise form disclosed in the following detailed
   description. Rather, the embodiments are chosen and described so that others skilled
25 in the art may utilize their teachings. It will be understood that no limitation of the scope
   of the invention is thereby intended. The invention includes any alterations and further
                                                   -5-

   modifications in the illustrative devices and described methods and further applications
   of the principles of the invention which would normally occur to one skilled in the art to
   which the invention relates.
   [0057]         With reference first to Figs. 1-4, the general nature of the vehicle will be
 5 described. As shown, vehicle 2 is an ATV class vehicle for a single rider having
   dimensions similar to those of the Polaris Sportsman XP vehicle. That is, the wheel
   base of ATV 2 (the longitudinal distance between the center of wheels 12, 14) is
   between 60 and 65 inches in length, and in the embodiment shown in 62 inches.
   However as vehicle 2 includes a roll cage structure 4, the vehicle includes a walk
 0 through opening at 6 as best shown in Fig. 3, accessing an operator's area 8. With that
   background, the vehicle will be described in greater detail.
   [0058]         As shown in Fig. 1, vehicle 2 includes a frame 10, supported by front
   wheels 12 and rear wheels 14. Frame 10 generally supports a powertrain 20 as well as
   a single seat 22 shown in the form of a bucket seat. The bucket seat 22 may take the
 5 form of the seat in the vehicle known as the Polaris RZR, which is also shown in U.S.
   Patent 7,819,220, mentioned above, the subject matter of which is incorporated herein
   by reference.
   [0059]         As shown in Fig. 2, the vehicle may be steered by a steering wheel 30
   which is adjustable by adjustment mechanism 32. Alternatively, vehicle 2 may be
 O steered by a handlebar as is known by the Polaris Sportsman XP referred to above. In
   terms of vehicle speed controls, vehicle 2 may have operator controls 34 in the form of
   an accelerator pedal and a brake pedal similar to that of the Polaris RZR vehicle, or the
   vehicle may have vehicle speed controls by way of a thumb throttle and hand brakes on
   the handlebar as known by the Polaris Sportsman XP. As also shown in Figs. 2 and 4,
25 ATV 2 includes a front suspension 40 and a rear suspension 42. With the ATV 2 as
   generally described, the ATV 2 will be described in greater detail.
   [0060]         With reference now to Figs. 5-9, frame 10 will be described in greater
   detail. As shown best in Figs. 5 and 6, frame 10 is comprised of frame tubes 50 and 52,
   which extend generally longitudinally and define the main structure for ATV 2. Frame

                                                   -9-

   thereto as described further herein. Plate sections 254 and 256 include mounting
   apertures 272 for mounting a winch thereto as further described herein.
   [0071]         It should be generally understood that the frame 10 as described above is
   a structurally rigid member. The frame is described as having a plurality of tubes and
 5 channels, and it should be understood that these items are structurally rigid, for
   example steel or aluminum tubes. Many plates are also referred to and these could be
   stamped and formed items of steel or aluminum construction, but they could also be
   one piece cast items, or composite materials. In the case of the steel construction, the
   various items are fixed together for example by welding, but the items could also be
 0 held together by fasteners, and some items could be held together by industrial
   adhesives, for example as shown and described in Applicants US patent application
   serial number 13/027,116 filed February 14, 2011, the subject matter of which is
   incorporated herein by reference.
   [0072]         With reference now to Fig. 13, front suspension 42 will be described in
 5 greater detail. As shown, front suspension 42 is comprised of lower control arms 280
   (also known as A-arms) having an inner end at 282 and an outer end at 284. As shown,
   inner end 282 is coupled between first and second mounting extensions 202, 214.
   Outer end 284 of control arm 280 is defined as a ball joint and is coupled to a lower end
   of strut 290. As shown, strut 290 includes an upper shock absorber portion 292 and a
 O lower steering portion 294. Steering portion 294 is comprised of a hub carrier 296
   having a hub 298 rotatably coupled thereto. Strut steering portion 294 also includes a
   steering coupler at 300 as described herein. Shock absorber portion 292 of strut 290 is
   coupled to portion 242 of shock tower 240. Thus it should be understood that lower
   control arm (and wheel 12 attached to it) is movable upwardly and downwardly under
25 the controlled resistance of an internal shock absorber 302.
   [0073]         With reference now to Figs. 14-17, the steering assembly will be described
   in greater detail. With reference first to Fig. 14, the steering assembly includes a
   steering mechanism 310, which in the disclosed embodiment is a rack and pinion type
   steering system having an input shaft 312 (Fig. 17) with an output to steering arms 314
30 (Fig. 14). Input to steering shaft 312 is by way of steering wheel 30 (Fig. 15) to a
                                                 -10-

   steering shaft 320 coupled to steering post 322. It should be understood that the
   connection of steering shaft 320 to steering post 322 and connection of steering post
   322 to steering mechanism 310 is by way of universal joints, for example universal joint
   324 shown in Fig. 15.
 5 [0074]         As mentioned above, steering wheel 30 and steering shaft 320 are
   pivotally connected to steering post mount portion 74, the pivoting angle being
   adjustable through adjustment mechanism 32. With reference again to Fig. 13, it should
   be appreciated that steering arms 314 are coupled to steering couplers 300 on strut
   290, the steering arms 314, therefore rotating the steering portions 294 of struts 290 for
 0 steering purposes. As shown best in Figs. 13 and 17, steering mechanism 310 is fixed
   to the rear surface of plate 250 fixedly coupling steering mechanism 310 to the frame
   10. In particular, steering mechanism 310 is attached by way of fasteners through
   apertures 270.
   [0075]         With reference now to Fig. 13 and 14, ATV 2 includes a front differential
 5 330 which includes constant velocity couplings 332 as output from differential 330 and
   further includes constant velocity couplings 336 (Fig. 13) as input to steering portions
   294, thereby driving hubs 298. As shown best in Fig. 13, differential is mounted to a top
   of plate 212 by way of a plurality of fasteners 340. As shown in Figs. 14 and 15,
   steering mechanism 310 and front differential 330 are positioned in a somewhat tandem
 O relationship and as best shown in Fig. 14, the centerline of differential 330 (shown at
   342 in Fig. 14) is positioned rearward of a centerline through constant velocity couplings
   336 (shown at 342 in Fig. 14), therefore sub shafts 338 angle forward to the constant
   velocity couplings 336. Differential 330 also includes an input shaft at 350 and a
   universal joint at 352.
25 [0076]         With reference now to Figs. 18-20, rear suspension 42 will be described in
   greater detail. As shown, rear suspension 42 is comprised of lower control arm 360 and
   upper control arm 362 coupled to brackets 100, 102. Lower control arm 360 has inner
   couplings at 364 and upper control arm 362 has couplings at 366. These couplings are
   positioned within channels 100, 102 and pivotally attached by way of fasteners 368 as
30 best shown in Fig. 19. Lower control arm 360 includes a bracket 370 for mounting a
                                                -11-

   shock absorber 372 with the shock rod 374 coupled to bracket 184 (Fig. 18). As shown
   best in Fig. 19, rear suspension 42 further comprises spindles 380 coupled to coupling
   382 of lower control arm 360 and upper coupling 384 of upper control arm 362. A hub
   390 is rotatably coupled to spindle 380 and includes a brake disk 392.
 5 [0077]        With reference now to Figs. 21 and 22, power train 20 is shown in greater
   detail. Power train 20 includes engine 60 and transmission 62 coupled to each other as
   shown in U.S. patent application in either of U.S. Patent Applications 12/849,480 or
   12/849,516, both of which were filed on August 3, 2010, the subject matter of which is
   incorporated herein by reference. Engine 60 couples to transmission by way of a
 0 continuously variable transmission (CVT) 400 and are mechanically connected to each
   other by way of links 402 (Fig. 23). CVT 400 includes an inner housing 410 and an
   outer housing 412 which houses a drive and driven clutch as is known in the art. Inner
   cover 410 includes cooling air inlet duct at 414 which may be connected to an intake
   duct as described in either of U.S. Patent Applications 12/849,480 or 12/849,516, both
 5 of which were filed on August 3, 2010, the subject matter of which is incorporated herein
   by reference.
   [0078]        As shown, transmission 62 includes an output 420 (Fig. 22) facing
   forwardly and positioned under CVT 400, which drives front differential 330 through
   drive shaft 426. As shown in Fig. 23, transmission 62 is integrated with rear differential
 O 430 having splined output drive couplings 432. Thus as shown, engine 60 and
   transmission 62 are both drivingly coupled to each other through CVT 400 as well as
   rigidly connected together by way of links 402. The engine and transmission can
   therefore be mounted as a subassembly and mounted within frame 10 of ATV 2.
   Engine and transmission subassembly are mounted via a three point mounting system
25 through front engine mount 440 and rear engine mount 442, as described below.
   [0079]         Front engine mount 440 is shown best in Fig. 21 having a cross beam 446
   attached to bracket 448 having mounting apertures at 450. Engine mount 440 is shown
   somewhat exploded away from engine 60 in Fig. 23, and it should be appreciated that
   front engine mount 440 is attached to the block of engine 60 by removing fasteners 460
30 and inserting fasteners 460 through mounting apertures 450. Front engine mount 440
                                               -12-

   further includes mount arms 462 which includes resilient engine mounts 464. With
   reference to Fig. 23, rear mount 442 includes a bracket 470 fixed to the transmission 62
   which retains a resilient engine mount 472 which is substantially the same as those
   shown at 464. Each of the mounts 464, 472 includes locating pegs 478 and fasteners
 5 480 for coupling the engine mounts to the frame.
   [0080]         With reference again to Figs. 18 and 19, engine and transmission
   subassembly is shown supported by the frame with engine mounts 464 attached to front
   engine mounts 140. In this configuration, locating pegs 478 of mounts 464 are located
   in locating apertures 148 (Fig. 10) while fasteners 480 are positioned through apertures
 0 146. Meanwhile, locating pegs 478 of mount 442 are located in locating apertures 146
   (Fig. 9) while fasteners 480 are positioned through apertures 134 (Fig. 9).
   [0081]         With reference now to Figs. 24-26, the operator's compartment 6 will be
   described in greater detail. As shown, ATV 2 includes a front enclosure member 500
   which includes a back wall 502, side walls 504 and 506, an inclined floor portion 508
 5 and floor board portion 510. A recess portion 512 is provided for the operator's foot,
   such that the operator's heel can be positioned in the recess 512 and operate the
   accelerator pedal 520 of the operator controls 34. The recess 512 could be similarly
   designed to that shown in U.S. patent application 12/218,572 filed July 16, 2008, the
   subject matter of which is incorporated herein by reference.
 O [0082]         Front enclosure 500 further includes a center section 521 including a first
   convex section 522, a protruding section 524 and a recessed portion 526. Front
   enclosure 500 further includes lateral sections 530 which extend outwardly from the
   operator's area and overlap frame tubes 230. As shown best in Fig. 26, the front
   enclosure 500 further includes a wall portion 534 extending upwardly from floor board
25 portion 510 extending substantially up to seat 22. With reference still to Fig. 26, ATV 2
   is shown in section which shows concave portion 522 extending over and providing
   clearance for differential 330; protrusion 524 providing clearance for universal joint 324;
   and recessed portion 526 providing clearance for steering rod 322.
   [0083]         It should also be appreciated that the operator's compartment, particularly
30 the feet room defined between side walls 504 and 506 is extremely voluminous, even
                                               -13-

   with the reduced wheel base of ATV 2. This is accomplished by providing the front
   steering mechanism 310 and front differential 330 in tandem relation relative to each
   other and by providing the front suspension as a strut mechanism as opposed to a
   double control arm mechanism. Said differently, if an upper control arm had been used
 5 in addition to the front lower control arm 280, then an inner coupling position of an upper
   control arm would have reduced the allowable space for front compartment 500. For
   example and with reference again to Fig. 14, if an upper control arm had been used, it
   would have been mounted generally vertically above lower control arms and would have
   been mounted above front differential 330. Rather, the use of a single lower control arm
 0 280 and the use of struts allow side walls 504 and 506 to be at least as wide as front
   frame tubes 230.
   [0084]         With reference now to Figs. 27-29, frame 10 is provided with a coupling
   assembly to couple roll cage 4. As shown in Fig. 27, couplers 158 are fixed within an
   open end of frame tube portion 156 and are provided in a semi-cylindrical configuration.
 5 As shown in Figs. 28 and 29, front frame tube 246 includes cut out portions 48 at each
   end which provides access to mounting apertures 550 (Fig. 29). More specifically, front
   frame tube 246 includes a front tube wall and a rear tube wall, and a portion of the front
   tube wall adjacent each end is cut away to expose the rear-tube wall. Couplers 552 are
   provided having a semi-cylindrical portion having a flat face 554 which can abut a back
 O surface 558 of frame tube 246, and the fasteners are received through apertures 550
   retaining couplers 552 thereto. As described, four couplers, that is couplers 158 and
   552 are provided such that roll cage 4 can be assembled and disassembled from ATV
   2, as further described herein. With reference again to Fig. 4, as described above roll
   cage 4 defines an enlarged enclosure for an operator. As shown in Fig. 4, due to the
25 outward configuration of frame tubes 150, the enclosure extends beyond lines 560
   which project from inner surfaces of the front tires. More particularly, a width shown at
   562 of the roll cage 4 is 36.028 inches in width (915.115 mm).
   [0085]         With reference now to Figs. 30-32, radiator 570 is shown supported by
   radiator bracket 572. Radiator bracket 572 is attached to front bracket 72 by way of
30 fasteners through apertures 576 of tabs 574 into threaded apertures 266 (Fig. 12).
   Radiator bracket 572 also includes upper tabs 580 having apertures 582 therethrough.
                                               -14-

   Tabs 580 overlap top wall 252 of bracket 72 and a fastener may be positioned through
   apertures 582 into threaded apertures 267. This provides an upper platform surface
   578 for supporting radiator 570.
   [0086]         As also shown in Fig. 32, winch 600 is provided having a mounting
 5 bracket 602 having apertures 604 with threaded members 606 attached thereto.
   Bracket 602 may be positioned within side walls 254, 256 with apertures 604 aligned
   with apertures 272 where upon a fastener may be positioned through apertures 272 to
   engage thread members 606.
   [0087]         With reference now to Figs. 33 and 34, roll cage 4 is shown in greater
 0 detail. As shown, roll cage 4 includes left frame member 610 and right frame member
   612, the frame members 610 and 612 being fastened together by way of cross braces
   614, 616 and 618. In the embodiment shown, cross braces 614, 616 and 618 are
   structural members formed of a rigid material and as shown are stamped and formed
   steel members. Brackets 622, 624 and 626 are coupled to the frame members 610 and
 5 612, and cross brace 614 is attached to the brackets 622; cross brace 616 is attached
   to the brackets 624; and cross brace 618 is attached to the brackets 626. In addition,
   front couplers 630 are provided, which correspond with couplers 552 (see Fig. 29), and
   the couplers 552, 630 are attached to each other by way of fasteners. Rear couplers
   632 are also provided, which correspond with couplers 158 (see Fig. 5), and the
 O couplers 158, 632 are attached to each other by way of fasteners. In the embodiment
   shown, brackets 622, 624 and 626 are structural members formed of steel or of a
   casting and are welded to the left and right frame members 610 and 612. Cross braces
   614, 616 and 618 may then be attached to the brackets by way of fasteners. As should
   be appreciated, the entire roll rage 4 can be added or removed by way of the fasteners
25 through the couplers 630, 632.
   [0088]         With reference now to Figs. 35-46, a second embodiment will be shown.
   With reference first to Figs. 35-36, the general nature of the vehicle will be described.
   As shown, vehicle 702 is an ATV class vehicle for a single rider having dimensions
   similar to those of the Polaris Sportsman XP vehicle. However as vehicle 702 includes
30 a roll cage structure 704, the vehicle includes a walk through opening at 706 entering
                                               -15-

   into operator's compartment 708, as best shown in Fig. 36. With that background, the
   vehicle will be described in greater detail.
   [0089]         As shown in Fig. 36, vehicle 702 includes a frame 710, supported by front
   wheels 712 and rear wheels 714. Frame 710 generally supports a powertrain 720 as
 5 well as a single seat 722 shown in the form of a bucket seat. The bucket seat 722 may
   take the form of the seat in the vehicle known as the Polaris RZR, which is also shown
   in U.S. Patent 7,819,220 (EP Patent 2046625 B1), the subject matter of which is
   incorporated herein by reference.
   [0090]         As shown in Fig. 36, the vehicle may be steered by a steering wheel 730
 0 which is adjustable by adjustable mechanism 732. Alternatively, vehicle 702 may be
   steered by a handlebar as is known by the Polaris Sportsman XP referred to above. In
   terms of vehicle speed controls, vehicle 702 may have an accelerator pedal and a brake
   pedal similar to that of the Polaris RZR vehicle, or the vehicle may have vehicle speed
   controls by way of a thumb throttle and hand brakes on the handlebar as known by the
 5 Polaris Sportsman XP. The vehicle 702 includes a front suspension 734 and a rear
   suspension 736, as best shown in Fig. 38.
   [0091]          In either event, and with reference to Fig. 37, operator's area 708 includes
   a front enclosure 740 defined by back wall 742 and shrouded sidewalls 744 and 746.
   This allows the operator's feet to be fully forward and nested in front enclosure 740
 O preventing the operator's feet and legs from moving from side to side. As also shown in
   Fig. 37, floorboard 748 is substantially flat allowing the ingress and egress of the
   operator. As shown, shrouded portion 744 can include an integrated cup holder such
   as 750 providing an ergonomic position for a cup holder or water bottle for the driver.
   As also shown in Figs. 38 and 39, entry treads 754 flank the operator walk through
25 entry. While these are shown as flush with the floorboard 748, it should be appreciated
   that they could also be provided with a lip, to further define an enclosure. Side nets
   may also be provided to cover the opening across the operator's entry way, as shown
   and described in assignee's pending US application serial number 12/796,495 (and
   corresponding PCT application PCT/US2010/38709 ) the subject matter of which is
30 incorporated herein by reference.
                                                 -16-

   [0092]         With reference again to Figs. 36 and 37, single seat 722 is shown having
   a seat bottom 760 for supporting the driver. As shown, seat bottom 760 is flanked by
   side panels 766 and 768. Side panel 766 could have an inner cavity accessed by a
   pivotal door which opens allowing the operator to have storage area inside the side
 5 panels 766, 768. Side panel 768 is partially occupied by a filler tube (not shown) which
   is connected to a gas tank situated under the driver's seat bottom 760 and which is
   closed by the filler cap 772 (Fig. 37). Side panel 768 would also include a pivotal door
   774. As shown, both the side panels 766 and 768 are approximately the same level as
   seat bottom 760 which allows the operator to use the top of the side panels for sliding in
 0 or out of the seat 722 upon ingress or egress. That in combination with the walk
   through entry, allows easy ingress/egress of the driver, even with the roll cage.
   [0093]         With reference now to Figs. 38-42, frame 710 will be described in greater
   detail. As shown best in Fig. 38, frame 710 is comprised of box tube frames 780 and
   782, which define the main structure for vehicle 702. Frame 710 includes a rear engine
 5 and transmission mount portion 784, a rear suspension mount portion 786 and front
   suspension mount portion shown generally at 788. As shown, frame 710 mounts an
   engine 790 and transmission 792 to mount portion 784. Engine 790 is of the type
   shown and described in Assignee's Serial No. 61/385,802 filed September 23, 2010,
   and corresponding PCT application PCTIUS2011/52914; the subject matter of which
 O are incorporated herein by reference. Transmission 792, and the mounting of the
   engine and transmission together, as well as the mounting of the engine 790 and
   transmission 792 to frame 710 is similar to that shown in either of U.S. Patent
   Applications 12/849,480 or 12/849,516, both of which were filed on August 3, 2010, and
   corresponding PCT application PCT/US2011/46395; the subject matter of which are
25 incorporated herein by reference.
   [0094]         As shown in Figs. 38, 39 and 46, front frame portion 788 is shown with
   frame tubes 780 and 782 that neck down and are coupled with frame uprights 801 and
   802, and which support crossbar 804, strut frame (or shock tower) 806 and frame tubes
   808. Front frame portion 788 allows mounting of struts 810, suspension arms 812, front
30 differential 814, rack and pinion steering mechanism 816 as well as steering arms 818.
   A steering post 820 (Fig. 46) extends upwardly from steering mechanism 816 for
                                               -17-

    steering the ATV 702. Half shafts or stub shafts 822 connect front differential 814 to the
    wheels by way of couplings 828. As shown in Fig. 46, a centerline through couplings
    828 is forward of a centerline through wheels 712, 714 and therefore stub shafts 822
    extend rearwardly and downwardly to the wheels 712, 714. Struts 810 are comprised of
 5  shock absorber portion 824 and hub portion 826, where hub portions 826 rotate relative
    to shock absorber portions 824.
    [0095]         With reference now to Fig. 40, the rear mount section 786 includes a
    frame tube 830 to which brackets of engine 790 are mounted as more fully described in
    our U.S. Applications 12/849,480 and 12/849,516 as described above. Transmission
 0  792 is also mounted to frame portion 784 (Fig. 38) by way of an isolation mount, again
    as described in Serial Nos. 12/849,480 and 12/849,516. As shown in Fig. 40, rear
    frame portion 784 further includes a rear bracket structure 840 for mounting muffler 842
    which is connected to engine by way of exhaust pipe 844. As shown, muffler 842 is
    positioned in the rear of the vehicle as shown in Figs. 38 and 40. As mounted, engine
 5  and transmission, 790, 792, provide an engine output shaft 850, a transmission input
    shaft 852 to which a continuously variable transmission (CVT, not shown) would be
    coupled. This provides a forward output shaft 854 for driving front differential and front
    wheels, and a rear output shaft (not shown) for driving rear wheels. With reference to
    Figs. 38 and 40, suspension frame mount 786 provides channels 858 for receiving
 ,0 double A-arms 860, 862 to which wheel hubs 864 are mounted.
    [0096]         With reference now to Figs. 41 and 42, upper support pedestals 880 are
    provided which are supported above frame rails 780 and 782 by bracing such as 882,
    884 and 886, and include connector members 890 attached thereto for attachment to
    roll cage 704.
25  [0097]         With reference now to Fig. 43, support bracket 900 is held by upright 802
    to support a connector 902 for attachment to the front of roll cage 704. Note that
    bracket 900 supports roll cage 704 forward of strut 810 as described herein.
    [0098]         With reference now to Fig. 44, a front frame casting 910 is provided which
    may be attached to front frame 788 and in particular to uprights 802 and cross-frame
30  806. Frame casting 910 provides support for front shroud 920 and front rack 922, as
                                                -18-

  shown in Figs. 35 and 36. A steering post 940 extends upwardly from front frame
  portion 788 providing support for steering wheel 730, as shown best in Fig. 46.
  [0099]        With reference again to Figs. 35-37, vehicle 702 also includes a rear utility
  box 950 supported on a rear of vehicle 702 where a rear portion 704a of roll cage 704
5 extends downwardly through cargo box 950 (through aperture 960, see Fig. 45) and
  portion 704b extends downwardly through an aperture 962 of front utility rack 922, see
  Figs. 36 and 43. As shown in Figs. 38 and 40, rear suspension includes a double A
  arm suspension having arms 970 and shock 972.
  [00100]       While this invention has been described as having an exemplary design,
0 the present invention may be further modified within the spirit and scope of this
  disclosure. This application is therefore intended to cover any variations, uses, or
  adaptations of the invention using its general principles. Further, this application is
  intended to cover such departures from the present disclosure as come within known or
  customary practices in the art to which this invention pertains.
