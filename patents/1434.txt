                                          ABSTRACT
A diagnostic method for predicting quantitatively whether a human tumor will be sensitive or
resistant to treatment with an ERBB3 inhibitor, e.g, an anti-ERBB3 antibody, is disclosed.
The method is based on measurement of NRG1 expression at the RNA level, or at the protein
level, in a tissue sample from the tumor.

                       CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS
    10001]       This application is a divisional application of Australian Application No.
    2012318541, filed on 5 October 2012, and is related to International Patent Application No.
    PCT/US2012/058871 and claims priority from U.S. provisional application no. 61/636,183,

                                       FIELD OF THE INVENTION
    10002]       The field of the invention is molecular biology, oncology, and clinical diagnostics.
                                              BACKGROUND
    10003]       Most cancer drugs are effective in some patients, but not in others. This results
    from genetic variation among tumors, and can be observed even among tumors within the same
    patient. Variable patient response is particularly pronounced with respect to targeted
 [0 therapeutics. Therefore, the full potential of targeted therapies cannot be realized without
    suitable tests for determining which patients will benefit from which drugs. According to the
    National Institutes of Health (NIH), the term "biomarker" is defined as "a characteristic that is
    objectively measured and evaluated as an indicator of normal biologic or pathogenic processes
    or pharmacological response to a therapeutic intervention." (Biomarkers Definitions Working
15  Group, 2001, Clin. Pharmacol.Ther. 69:89-95)
    The development of improved diagnostics based on the discovery of biomarkers has the
    potential to accelerate new drug development by identifying, in advance, those patients most
    likely to show a clinical response to a given drug. This would significantly reduce the size,
    length and cost of clinical trials. Technologies such as genomics, proteomics and molecular
20  imaging currently enable rapid, sensitive and reliable detection of specific gene mutations,
    expression levels of particular genes, and other molecular biomarkers. In spite of the
    availability of various technologies for molecular characterization of tumors, the clinical

                                                 -2
   utilization of cancer biomarkers remains largely unrealized because few cancer biomarkers
   have been discovered. For example, a recent review article states:
            There is a critical need for expedited development of biomarkers and their
            use to improve diagnosis and treatment of cancer. (Cho, 2007, Molecular
 5          Cancer 6:25)
   Another recent review article on cancer biomarkers contains the following comments:
            The challenge is discovering cancer biomarkers. Although there have been
            clinical successes in targeting molecularly defined subsets of several tumor
            types - such as chronic myeloid leukemia, gastrointestinal stromal tumor,
10          lung cancer and glioblastoma multiforme - using molecularly targeted
            agents, the ability to apply such successes in a broader context is severely
            limited by the lack of an efficient strategy to evaluate targeted agents in
            patients. The problem mainly lies in the inability to select patients with
            molecularly defined cancers for clinical trials to evaluate these exciting new
15          drugs. The solution requires biomarkers that reliably identify those patients
            who are most likely to benefit from a particular agent. (Sawyers, 2008,
            Nature 452:548-552, at 548)
   Comments such as the foregoing illustrate the recognition of a need for the discovery of
   clinically useful biomarkers and diagnostic methods based on such biomarkers.
20 [0005]        There are three distinct types of cancer biomarkers: (1) prognostic biomarkers, (2)
   predictive biomarkers, and (3) pharmacodynamic (PD) biomarkers. A prognostic biomarker is
   used to classify a cancer, e.g., a solid tumor, according to aggressiveness, i.e., rate of growth
   and/or metastasis, and refractiveness to treatment. This is sometimes called distinguishing
   "good outcome" tumors from "poor outcome" tumors. A predictive biomarker is used to assess
25 the probability that a particular patient will benefit from treatment with a particular drug. For
   example, patients with breast cancer in which the ERBB2 (HER2) gene is amplified are likely
   to benefit from treatment with trastuzumab (HERCEPTIN*), whereas patients without ERBB2
   gene amplification are unlikely to benefit from treatment with trastuzumab. A PD biomarker is
   an indication of the effect(s) of a drug on its molecular target while the patient is taking the
30 drug. Accordingly, PD biomarkers often are used to guide dosage level and dosing frequency,
   during the early stages of clinical development of a new drug. For a discussion of cancer
   biomarkers, see, e.g., Sawyers, 2008, Nature 452:548-552.
   [0006]        Tumors driven by EGFR or HER2 often respond to treatment with inhibitors of
   EGFR or HER2, but these tumors invariably develop resistance to these inhibitors. At least one

                                                -3
   mechanism of acquired resistance to anti-EGFR or anti-HER2 treatment is activation of
   ERBB3 (also known as HER3) signaling. See, e.g., Engelman et al., 2006, Clin. CancerRes.
    12:4372; Ritter et al., 2007, Clin. CancerRes. 13:4909; Sergina et al., 2007, Nature 445:437.
   NRG 1-induced activation of HER2-ERBB3 heterodimers also has been associated with
 5 resistance to EGFR inhibitors (Zhou et al., 2006, Cancer Cell 10:39). Thus, ERBB3 plays an
   important role in development of drug resistance, as well as being involved in tumor initiation
   and maintenance, through its heterodimerization with EGFR and HER2. Consequently, there
   has been interest in development of ERBB3 inhibitors, especially anti-ERBB3 antibodies, since
   ERBB3 lacks kinase activity.
10 [0007]       As with other types of targeted therapy, some, but not all, tumors respond to anti
   ERBB3 therapy. Therefore, there is a need for diagnostic methods based on predictive
   biomarkers that can be used to identify patients with tumors that are likely (or unlikely) to
   respond to treatment with an ERBB3 inhibitor such as an anti-ERBB3 antibody.
                                               SUMMARY
   [0008]       The invention is based, in part, on the discovery that neuregulin-1 (NRG1)
15 expression in a tissue sample from a mammalian tumor (e.g., a human tumor) correlates with
   sensitivity of the tumor to treatment with an ERBB3 inhibitor, e.g., an anti-ERBB3 antibody.
   Surprisingly, it has been discovered that the correlation is strong enough that measurement of
   NRG1 expression alone is sufficient for useful classification of a tumor as sensitive or resistant
   to treatment with an ERBB3 inhibitor. Accordingly, the invention provides a method of
20 identifying a tumor that is sensitive to treatment with an ERBB3 inhibitor. The method
   includes: (a) measuring NRG1 gene expression in a tissue sample from the tumor, thereby
   determining an NRG 1 score; and (b) comparing the NRG 1 score against a threshold score
   defined by a threshold determination analysis. An NRG1 score equal to or above the threshold
   score indicates that the tumor is likely to be sensitive to treatment with an ERBB3 inhibitor,
25 e.g., an anti-ERBB3 antibody. Alternatively, an NRG1 score below the threshold indicates that
   the tumor is likely to be resistant to treatment with an ERBB3 inhibitor, e.g., an anti-ERBB3
   antibody. In certain embodiments, the method is not based on the expression of any other gene
   than NRG 1.

                                              -4
   [0009]      Measurement of NRG1 expression can be at the protein level, e.g., by immuno
   histochemistry (IHC) involving a chromophore or fluorophore conjugated to an anti-NRG1
   antibody. Alternatively, measurement of NRG1 expression can be at the RNA level, e.g., by
   measuring the level of mRNA encoding NRG1, e.g., by quantitative PCR or microarray. The
 5 threshold determination analysis can include a receiver operator characteristic curve analysis.
   Methods of the invention are useful for testing various types of tumors, e.g., solid tumors,
   including, e.g., breast tumors, lung tumors, kidney tumors, colorectal tumors, head and neck
   tumors, esophageal tumors, ovarian tumors, and pancreatic tumors.

                         DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
   Definitions
   [0035]       As used herein, "AV-203" means the humanized anti-human ERBB3 monoclonal
   antibody whose full-length heavy chain amino acid sequence is SEQ ID NO: 9, and whose full
10 length light chain amino acid sequence is SEQ ID NO: 10.
   [0036]       As used herein, "ERBB3" (also known as HER3) means the human protein encoded
   by the gene identified by Entrez Gene ID No. 2065, and allelic variants thereof.
   [0037]       As used herein, "ERBB3 inhibitor" means a molecule (small molecule or
   macromolecule, e.g., an antibody or antigen binding fragment thereof) that binds to ERBB3
15 and inhibits, neutralizes, prevents or eliminates the biological activity of ERBB3 in a tumor
   cell.
   [0038]       As used herein, "NRGl" (also known as neuregulin-1, heregulin, HRG and HRG1)
   means the human protein encoded by the gene identified by Entrez Gene ID No. 3084, and
   allelic variants thereof.
20 [0039]       As used herein, "optimum threshold score" means the threshold score at which the
   classifier gives the most desirable balance between the cost of false negative calls and false
   positive calls.
   [0040]       As used herein, "receiver operating characteristic" (ROC) curve means a plot of
   false positive rate (sensitivity) versus true positive rate (specificity) for a binary classifier
25 system. In construction of an ROC curve, the following definitions apply:
            False negative rate: FNR = 1 - TPR
            True positive rate:    TPR = true positive / (true positive + false negative)

                                               -8
           False positive rate:  FPR = false positive / (false positive + true negative)
   [0041]      As used herein, "response" or "responding" to treatment means, with regard to a
   treated tumor, that the tumor displays: (a) slowing of growth, (b) cessation of growth, or (c)
   regression.
 5 [0042]      As used herein, a "NRG1 score" is a numerical value representing the level of
   NRG1 expression in a tumor. The NRG1 score can be based on NRG1 gene expression at the
   RNA level or at the protein level. For example, an NRG1 score could be expressed as a (1) Ct
   value from a qRT-PCR assay, or (2) staining intensity in an IHC assay. Ct value and NRG1
   expression are inversely related. Therefore, a lower Ct value translates to a higher NRG1
10 score. The NRG1 score can be interpreted with respect to a threshold score, which can be
   empirically determined in a threshold determination analysis, e.g., using ROC curve analysis.
   [0043]      As used herein, "threshold determination analysis" means analysis of a dataset
   representing a given tumor type, e.g., human renal cell carcinoma, to determine a threshold
   score for that particular tumor type. The dataset representing a given tumor type includes, for
15 each tumor from a population of such tumors: (a) actual tumor response data (response and
   non-response to an ERBB3 inhibitor such as an anti-ERBB3 antibody), and (b)
   NRGlexpression level.
   [0044]      As used herein, "threshold score" means a score above which a tumor is classified
   as being sensitive to treatment with an ERBB3 inhibitor.
20 ERBB3 Antibodies
   [0045]      The methods disclosed herein can be used for predicting tumor response to
   treatment with an ERBB3 inhibitor such as an anti-ERBB3 antibody, or antigen-binding
   fragment of an anti-ERBB3 antibody. In some embodiments, a tumor is classified as sensitive
   or resistant to an ERBB3 antibody (or antigen binding fragment thereof) that inhibits or
25 prevents NRG1 (e.g., NRGl-P31) from binding to ERBB3, thereby indirectly inhibiting or
   preventing ligand-induced dimerization of ERBB3 (e.g., anti-ERBB3 antibodies AV-203,
   04D01, 12A07, 18H02 and 22A02). In other embodiments, a tumor is classified as sensitive or
   resistant to an antibody (or antigen-binding fragment thereof) that inhibits or prevents ERBB3
   dimerization, without preventing NRG1 binding to ERBB3 (e.g., anti-ERBB3 antibody 09D03
30 and 1IGO1).

   [0052]      Anti-ERBB3 antibody 18H02 comprises an immunoglobulin heavy chain variable

20 [0053]      Anti-ERBB3 antibody 22A02 comprises an immunoglobulin heavy chain variable
   region comprising a CDRH1 comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 57, a CDRH2
   comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 58, and a CDRH3 comprising the amino

   chain amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 61 and an immunoglobulin light chain amino acid
   sequence of SEQ ID NO: 62, as shown in FIG. 11.
   [0054]      It is contemplated that the skilled person would understand that a complete heavy or
   kappa chain antibody sequences can be created by ligating a variable region as described above
 5 to a respective constant region sequence(s) to produce active full length immunoglobulin heavy
   and light chains. For example, a complete heavy chain comprises a heavy variable sequence
   followed by the murine or human IgGI or IgG2b heavy chain constant sequence (which are
   known in the art) and a complete kappa chain comprises a kappa variable sequence followed by
   the murine or human kappa light chain constant sequence (which are known in the art). It is
10 further contemplated that CDR1, CDR2, and CDR3 sequences from the immunoglobulin heavy
   and light chains may be interposed between human or humanized immunoglobulin framework
   regions.
   Tissue Sample
   [0055]      A tissue sample from a tumor in a human patient (e.g., a tissue sample from a tumor
15 obtained from a human patient, e.g., a human patient being considered for treatment with an
   ERBB3 inhibitor) can be used as a source of RNA, a source of protein, or a source of thin
   sections for immunohistochemistry (IHC), so the level of NRG1 in the sample can be
   determined in practicing the disclosed methods. The tissue sample can be obtained by using
   conventional tumor biopsy instruments and procedures. Endoscopic biopsy, excisional biopsy,
20 incisional biopsy, fine needle biopsy, punch biopsy, shave biopsy and skin biopsy are examples
   of recognized medical procedures that can be used by one of skill in the art to obtain tumor
   samples. The tumor tissue sample should be large enough to provide sufficient RNA, protein,
   or thin sections for measuring NRG1 and ERBB3 gene expression.
   [0056]      The tumor tissue sample can be in any form that allows measurement of NRG1 and
25 ERBB3 expression or content. In other words, the tissue sample must be sufficient for RNA
   extraction, protein extraction, or preparation of thin sections. Accordingly, the tissue sample
   can be fresh, preserved through suitable cryogenic techniques, or preserved through non
   cryogenic techniques. A standard process for handling clinical biopsy specimens is to fix the
   tissue sample in formalin and then embed it in paraffin. Samples in this form are commonly

                                               - 13
   known as formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue. Suitable techniques of tissue
   preparation for subsequent analysis are well-known to those of skill in the art.
   NRG1 Gene Expression
   [0057]      As described herein, determining or measuring the level of NRG1 gene expression
 5 in a tissue sample from a tumor can be performed by any suitable method. Several such
   methods are known in the art. For example, determining NRG1 gene expression can be done
   by measuring the level or amount of NRG1 protein, or measuring the level or amount of NRG1
   RNA, in a sample.
   [0058]      Neuregulin 1 is produced in numerous isoforms upon expression of the NRG1 gene.
10 Relative abundance of the various isoforms appears to vary, depending on factors such as tissue
   type and/or developmental stage. The EGF-like domain of Neuregulin 1 is essential for
   binding to ERBB3. It is found in all of the various NRG1 isoforms as a beta variant (NRG1p)
   or alpha variant (NRGa). Therefore, when determining the level NRG1 gene expression as
   described herein, the NRG1 assay preferably is designed to detect at least the EGF-like domain
15 of NRG1, in order to detect most, if not all, of the NRG1 isoforms present. Accordingly, in
   some embodiments, PCR primers are designed to amplify a portion of the EGF-like domain.
   Similarly, in some embodiments, microarray probes are designed to hybridize with a sequence
   in the EGF-like domain or a sequence conserved across multiple variants. If an anti-NRG1
   antibody is used to detect NRG1 protein, the antibody preferably will recognize the EGF-like
20 domain.
   [0059]      In some embodiments, classification of a tumor as sensitive or resistant to treatment
   with an ERBB3 inhibitor is based solely on the expression of NRG1 in a tissue sample from the
   tumor. In other embodiments, expression of one or more other genes is measured in addition to
   NRG1 expression, to classify a tumor as sensitive or resistant to treatment with an ERBB3
25 inhibitor. It is contemplated herein that in embodiments when the expression of one or more
   other genes is measured in addition to NRG1, the one or more other genes do not include
   ErbB1, ErbB2, and ErbB3 (e.g., monomers, heterodimers and/or homodimers of any of ErbB1,
   ErbB2 and ErbB3, and/or phosphorylated ErbB1, ErbB2 and ErbB3 either in monomeric or
   dimeric form). In other embodiments, the expression of NRG1 is not measured in combination
30 with beta-cellulin (BCT) secretion. It is further contemplated herein that the expression of one

                                               - 14
   or more other genes measured in addition to NRG1 may include genes serving as controls or
   standards, e.g., for data normalization.
   RNA Analysis
   [0060]      Conventional microarray analysis and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
 5 are examples of methods for determining the level of NRG1 gene expression at the mRNA
   level. In some embodiments, RNA is extracted from the cells, tumor or tissue of interest using
   standard protocols. In other embodiments, RNA analysis is performed using techniques that do
   not require RNA isolation.
   [0061]      Methods for rapid and efficient extraction of eukaryotic mRNA, i.e., poly(a) RNA,
10 from tissue samples are well established and known to those of skill in the art. See, e.g.,
   Ausubel et al., 1997, CurrentProtocolsofMolecular Biology, John Wiley & Sons. The tissue
   sample can be fresh, frozen or fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples such as clinical study
   tumor specimens. In general, RNA isolated from fresh or frozen tissue samples tends to be less
   fragmented than RNA from FFPE samples. FFPE samples of tumor material, however, are
15 more readily available, and FFPE samples are suitable sources of RNA for use in methods of
   the present invention. For a discussion of FFPE samples as sources of RNA for gene
   expression profiling by RT-PCR, see, e.g., Clark-Langone et al., 2007, BMC Genomics 8:279.
   Also see, De Andres et al., 1995, Biotechniques 18:42044; and Baker et al., U.S. Patent
   Application Publication No. 2005/0095634. The use of commercially available kits with
20 vendor's instructions for RNA extraction and preparation is widespread and common.
   Commercial vendors of various RNA isolation products and complete kits include Qiagen
   (Valencia, CA), Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA), Ambion (Austin, TX) and Exiqon (Woburn, MA).
   [0062]      In general, RNA isolation begins with tissue/cell disruption. During tissue/cell
   disruption it is desirable to minimize RNA degradation by RNases. One approach to limiting
25 RNase activity during the RNA isolation process is to ensure that a denaturant is in contact with
   cellular contents as soon as the cells are disrupted. Another common practice is to include one
   or more proteases in the RNA isolation process. Optionally, fresh tissue samples are immersed
   in an RNA stabilization solution, at room temperature, as soon as they are collected. The
   stabilization solution rapidly permeates the cells, stabilizing the RNA for storage at 4'C, for
30 subsequent isolation. One such stabilization solution is available commercially as RNAlater*
   (Ambion, Austin, TX).

                                               - 15
   [00631       In some protocols, total RNA is isolated from disrupted tumor material by cesium
   chloride density gradient centrifugation. In general, mRNA makes up approximately 1%to 5%
   of total cellular RNA. Immobilized Oligo(dT), e.g., oligo(dT) cellulose, is commonly used to
   separate mRNA from ribosomal RNA and transfer RNA. If stored after isolation, RNA must
 5 be stored under RNase-free conditions. Methods for stable storage of isolated RNA are known
   in the art. Various commercial products for stable storage of RNA are available.
                Microarray
   [0064]       The mRNA expression level of NRG1 can be measured using conventional DNA
   microarray expression profiling technology. A DNA microarray is a collection of specific
10 DNA segments or probes affixed to a solid surface or substrate such as glass, plastic or silicon,
   with each specific DNA segment occupying a known location in the array. Hybridization with
   a sample of labeled RNA, usually under stringent hybridization conditions, allows detection
   and quantitation of RNA molecules corresponding to each probe in the array. After stringent
   washing to remove non-specifically bound sample material, the microarray is scanned by
15 confocal laser microscopy or other suitable detection method. Modern commercial DNA
   microarrays, often known as DNA chips, typically contain tens of thousands of probes, and
   thus can measure expression of tens of thousands of genes simultaneously. Such microarrays
   can be used in practicing the present invention. Alternatively, custom chips containing as few
   probes as those needed to measure NRG1, plus necessary controls or standards, e.g., for data
20 normalization, can be used in practicing the disclosed methods.
   [0065]       To facilitate data normalization, a two-color microarray reader can be used. In a
   two-color (two-channel) system, samples are labeled with a first fluorophore that emits at a first
   wavelength, while an RNA or cDNA standard is labeled with a second fluorophore that emits at
   a different wavelength. For example, Cy3 (570 nm) and Cy5 (670 nm) often are employed
25 together in two-color microarray systems.
   [0066]       DNA microarray technology is well-developed, commercially available, and widely
   employed. Therefore, in performing disclosed methods, a person of ordinary skill in the art can
   use microarray technology to measure expression levels of genes encoding biomarker proteins
   without undue experimentation. DNA microarray chips, reagents (such as those for RNA or
30 cDNA preparation, RNA or cDNA labeling, hybridization and washing solutions), instruments

                                             - 16
   (such as microarray readers) and protocols are well known in the art and available from various
   commercial sources. Commercial vendors of microarray systems include Agilent Technologies
   (Santa Clara, CA) and Affymetrix (Santa Clara, CA), but other PCR systems can be used.
               Quantitative PCR
 5 [0067]      The level of mRNA encoding NRG 1 can be measured using conventional
   quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) technology.
   Advantages of qRT-PCR include sensitivity, flexibility, quantitative accuracy, and ability to
   discriminate between closely related mRNAs. Guidance concerning the processing of tissue
   samples for quantitative PCR is available from various sources, including manufacturers and
10 vendors of commercial instruments and reagents for qRT-PCR (e.g., Qiagen (Valencia, CA)
   and Ambion (Austin, TX)). Instruments and systems for automated performance of qRT-PCR
   are commercially available and used routinely in many laboratories. An example of a well
   known commercial system is the Applied Biosystems 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR System
   (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).
15 [0068]      Once mRNA is isolated, the first step in gene expression measurement by RT-PCR
   is the reverse transcription of the mRNA template into cDNA, which is then exponentially
   amplified in a PCR reaction. Two commonly used reverse transcriptases are avilo
   myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (AMV-RT) and Moloney murine leukemia virus
   reverse transcriptase (MMLV-RT). The reverse transcription reaction typically is primed with
20 specific primers, random hexamers, or oligo(dT) primers. Suitable primers are commercially
   available, e.g., GeneAmp* RNA PCR kit (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA). The resulting cDNA
   product can be used as a template in the subsequent polymerase chain reaction.
   [0069]      The PCR step is carried out using a thermostable DNA-dependent DNA
   polymerase. The polymerase most commonly used in PCR systems is a Thermus aquaticus
25 (Taq) polymerase. The selectivity of PCR results from the use of primers that are
   complementary to the DNA region targeted for amplification, i.e., regions of the cDNAs
   reverse transcribed from genes encoding proteins of interest. Therefore, when qRT-PCR is
   employed in the present invention, primers specific to each marker gene are based on the
   cDNA sequence of the gene. Commercial technologies such as SYBR* green or TaqMan*
30 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) can be used in accordance with the vendor's

                                               - 17
   instructions. Messenger RNA levels can be normalized for differences in loading among
   samples by comparing the levels of housekeeping genes such as beta-actin or GAPDH. The
   level of mRNA expression can be expressed relative to any single control sample such as
   mRNA from normal, non-tumor tissue or cells. Alternatively, it can be expressed relative to
 5 mRNA from a pool of tumor samples, or tumor cell lines, or from a commercially available set
   of control mRNA.
   [0070]      Suitable primer sets for PCR analysis of expression of genes NRG1 or ERBB3 can
   be designed and synthesized by one of skill in the art, without undue experimentation.
   Alternatively, PCR primer sets for practicing the present invention can be purchased from
10 commercial sources, e.g., Applied Biosystems. PCR primers preferably are about 17 to 25
   nucleotides in length. Primers can be designed to have a particular melting temperature (Tm),
   using conventional algorithms for Tm estimation. Software for primer design and Tm
   estimation are available commercially, e.g., Primer Express TM (Applied Biosystems), and also
   are available on the internet, e.g., Primer3 (Massachusetts Institute of Technology). By
15 applying established principles of PCR primer design, a large number of different primers can
   be used to measure the expression level of any given gene, including NRG 1 and ERBB3.
               qNPATM
   [0071]      In some embodiments, RNA analysis is performed using a technology that does not
   involve RNA extraction or isolation. One such technology is quantitative nuclease protection
20 assay, which is commercially available under the name qNPATM (High Throughput Genomics,
   Inc., Tucson, AZ). This technology can be advantageous when the tumor tissue samples to be
   analyzed are in the form of FFPE material. See, e.g., Roberts et al., 2007, Laboratory
   Investigation 87:979-997.
   Protein analysis
25 [0072]      In other embodiments, NRG1 and ERBB3 gene expression can be detected at the
   protein level. Examples of methods for measuring the level of NRG1 or ERBB3 gene
   expression at the protein level include enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and IHC
   analysis.

                                                - 18
                ELISA
   [0073]       Performing an NRG1 ELISA requires at least one antibody against NRG1, i.e., the
   detection antibody. NRG1 protein from a sample to be analyzed is immobilized on a solid
   support such as a polystyrene microtiter plate. This immobilization can be by non-specific
 5 binding, i.e., through adsorption to the surface. Alternatively, immobilization can be by
   specific binding, i.e., through binding of NRG1 from the sample by a capture antibody (anti
   NRG1 antibody different from the detection antibody), in a "sandwich" ELISA. After the
   NRG1 is immobilized, the detection antibody is added, and the detection antibody forms a
   complex with the bound NRGl. The detection antibody is linked to an enzyme, either directly
10 or indirectly, e.g., through a secondary antibody that specifically recognizes the detection
   antibody. Typically between each step, the plate, with bound NRG1, is washed with a mild
   detergent solution. Typical ELISA protocols also include one or more blocking steps, which
   involve use of a non-specifically-binding protein such as bovine serum albumin to block
   unwanted non-specific binding of protein reagents to the plate. After a final wash step, the
15 plate is developed by addition of an appropriate enzyme substrate, to produce a visible signal,
   which indicates the quantity of NRG1 in the sample. The substrate can be, e.g., a chromogenic
   substrate or a fluorogenic substrate. ELISA methods, reagents and equipment are well-known
   in the art and commercially available.
                Immunohistochemistry (IHC)
20 [0074]       The presence and level of NRG1 in a tumor tissue sample, or clinical specimen, can
   be determined (e.g., visualized) by immunohistochemistry (IHC) or immunofluorescence (IF).
   Because clinical specimens often are preserved as formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE)
   blocks, IHC and IF are particularly useful for measuring NRG1 protein in clinical specimens.
   Assaying NRG1 by IHC or IF requires at least one antibody against NRGl. Anti-NRG1
25 antibodies suitable for IHC and IF are commercially available. For example, suitable
   antibodies can be purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN), abeam (Cambridge, MA),
   Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA), or Novus Biologicals (Littleton, CO). Using
   standard techniques, the anti-NRG1 antibody can be used to detect the presence of NRG1
   protein in thin sections, e.g., 5 micron sections, obtained from tumors, including FFPE sections
30 and frozen tumor sections. Typically, the tumor sections are initially treated in such a way as
   to retrieve the antigenic structure of proteins that were fixed in the initial process of collecting

                                                 - 19
    and preserving the tumor material. Slides are then blocked to prevent non-specific binding by
    the anti-NRG1 detection antibody. The presence of NRG1 protein is then detected by binding
    of the anti-NRG1 antibody (primary antibody) to the NRG1 protein. The detection antibody
    (secondary antibody), which recognizes and binds to the primary antibody, is linked to a
 5  detectable enzyme or fluorophore. Typically, the tumor sections are washed and blocked with
    non-specific protein such as bovine serum albumin between steps. If the detection antibody is
    linked to a detectable enzyme, the slide is developed using an appropriate enzyme substrate to
    produce a visible signal. If the detection antibody is linked to a fluorophore, the slide is viewed
    by using a fluorescence microscope. The samples can be counterstained with hematoxylin.
10  Data Interpretation
    [0075]       An NRG1 score for a tumor can be interpreted with respect to a threshold score. An
    NRG1 score that is equal to or higher than the threshold score can be interpreted as predictive
    of the tumor being sensitive (responsive) to treatment with an ERBB3 inhibitor, e.g., an
    ERBB3 antibody. Alternatively, NRG1 scores equal to or lower than the threshold score can
15  be interpreted as predictive of a tumor being resistant (non-responsive) to treatment with an
    ERBB3 inhibitor.
    [0076]       An optimum threshold NRG1 score can be determined (or at least approximated)
    empirically by performing a threshold determination analysis. Preferably, threshold
    determination analysis includes receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. ROC
20  curve analysis is an established statistical technique, the application of which is within ordinary
    skill in the art. For a discussion of ROC curve analysis, see generally Zweig et al., 1993,
    "Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) plots: a fundamental evaluation tool in clinical
    medicine," Clin. Chem. 39:561-577; and Pepe, 2003, The statisticalevaluation of medical tests
   for classificationandprediction, Oxford Press, New York.
25  [0077]       NRG1 scores and the optimum threshold NRG1 score may vary from tumor type to
    tumor type. Therefore, a threshold determination analysis preferably is performed on one or
    more datasets representing any given tumor type to be tested using the present invention. The
    dataset used for threshold determination analysis includes: (a) actual response data (response
    or non-response), and (b) an NRG1 score for each tumor sample from a group of tumors. Once
30  an NRG1 score threshold is determined with respect to a given tumor type, that threshold can

                                               - 20
   be applied to interpret NRG1 scores from tumors of that tumor type. In certain embodiments, a
   threshold score is determined by measuring NRG1 expression in tissue samples of tumors
   obtained from human patients previously treated with an anti-ERBB3 inhibitor and shown to be
   sensitive to the anti-ERBB3 inhibitor and human patients previously treated with an anti
 5 ERBB3 inhibitor and shown to be resistant to anti-ERBB3 inhibitor.
   [0078]      The ROC curve analysis can be performed as follows. Any sample with an NRG1
   score greater than or equal to the threshold is identified as a responder (sensitive).
   Alternatively, any sample with an NRG1 score less than the threshold is identified as a non
   responder (resistant). For every NRG1 score from a tested set of samples, "responders" and
10 "non-responders" (hypothetical calls) are classified using that score as the threshold. This
   process enables calculation of TPR (y vector) and FPR (x vector) for each potential threshold,
   through comparison of hypothetical calls against the actual response data for the data set. Then
   an ROC curve is constructed by making a dot plot, using the TPR vector, and FPR vector. If
   the ROC curve is above the diagonal from (0, 0) point to (1.0, 0.5) point, it shows that the
15 NRG1 test result is a better test result than random.
   [0079]      The ROC curve can be used to identify the best operating point, or optimum
   threshold. The best operating point is the one that yields the best balance between the cost of
   false positives weighed against the cost of false negatives. These costs need not be equal. The
   average expected cost (C) of classification at point x,y in the ROC space is determined by the
20 following formula.
                   C  = (1-p) alpha*x + p*beta(1-y)
                   wherein:
                   alpha = cost of a false positive,
                   beta = cost of missing a positive (false negative), and
25                 p = proportion of positive cases.
   [0080]      False positives and false negatives can be weighted differently by assigning
   different values for alpha and beta. For example, if it is decided to include more patients in the
   responder group at the cost of treating more patients who are non-responders, one can put more
   weight on alpha. In this case, it is assumed that the cost of false positive and false negative is

                                              -21
   the same (alpha equals to beta). Therefore, the average expected cost of classification at point
   x,y in the ROC space is:
                   C' = (1-p)*x + p*(1-y).
   The smallest C' can be calculated after using all pairs of false positive and false negative (x, y).
 5 The optimum score threshold is calculated as the score of the (x, y) at C'.
   [0081]      In addition to predicting whether a tumor will be sensitive or resistant to treatment
   with an ERBB3 inhibitor, i.e., binary classification, an NRG1 score provides an approximate,
   but useful, indication of how likely a tumor is to be sensitive or resistant. In general, the higher
   the NRG1 score, the more likely a tumor is to be sensitive to an ERBB3 inhibitor, and the
10 lower the NRG1 score, the more likely a tumor is to be resistant to an ERBB3 inhibitor.
   Test Kits
   [0082]      Also disclosed is a diagnostic test kit comprising certain components for performing
   methods of the invention. A diagnostic test kit enhances convenience, speed and
   reproducibility in the performance of diagnostic assays. For example, in an exemplary qRT
15 PCR-based embodiment, a basic diagnostic test kit includes PCR primers for analyzing
   expression of NRGl. In other embodiments, a more elaborate test kit contains not only PCR
   primers, but also buffers, reagents and detailed instructions for measuring NRG1 expression
   levels, using PCR technology. In some embodiments, the kit includes a test protocol and all the
   consumable components needed for the test, except the RNA sample(s).
20 [0083]      In an exemplary DNA microarray-based embodiment, a test kit includes a micro
   fluidic card (array) designed for use with a particular instrument. Optionally, the micro fluidic
   card is a custom made device designed specifically for measurement of NRGl. Such custom
   micro fluidic cards are commercially available. For example, the TaqMan Array is a 384-well
   micro fluidic card (array) designed for use with the Applied Biosystems 7900HT Fast Real
25 Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). It is understood that additional
   probes can optionally be included on a fluidic card to measure the expression of one or more
   additional genes. Such additional genes may be included to serve as controls or standards, e.g.,
   for data normalization, or may be otherwise informative.

   [0084]       In some embodiments, the test kit contains materials for determining NRG1 content
   by IHC. An IHC kit, for example, may contain a primary antibody against NRG1, and a
   secondary antibody conjugated to a reporter enzyme, e.g., horseradish peroxidase. In some
   embodiments, the secondary antibody is replaced with a conjugated polymer that specifically
 5 recognizes the primary antibody.
                                                EXAMPLES
   [0085]       The invention is further illustrated by the following examples. The examples are
   provided for illustrative purposes only, and are not to be construed as limiting the scope or
   content of the invention in any way.
   Example 1: Xenograft Tumor Response to AV-203
10 [0086]       Evaluation of tumor response to AV-203 was performed as follows. In order to
   establish xenograft tumor, tumor cells were initially grown in culture at 370 C in an atmosphere
   containing 5% C02, using medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were inoculated
   subcutaneously into the flank of 8-week old female NCR nude or CB. 17 SCID mice (Taconic
   Labs) with 2-10 x 106 cells per mouse in 50% matrigel (BD Biosciences, Cat No. 356237).
15 Tumor measurements were taken twice weekly using vernier calipers. Tumor volume was
   calculated using the formula: width x width x length/2. When tumors reached approximately
   200 mm 3, the mice were randomized into two groups of 10 mice each, PBS vehicle control or
   AV-203 dosed intraperitoneally (IP) at 20 mg/kg twice weekly. In some studies, a second
   control group was used, which received human IgG dosed at 20 mg/kg IP twice weekly.
20 [0087]       In total, 25 xenograft tumors were treated with AV-203. Response to AV-203 was
   varied, ranging from -10% tumor growth inhibition (TGI) to tumor regression. "Tumor
   regression" means that a tumor is smaller at the end of the evaluation period compared to the
   size of the tumor at the beginning of the evaluation period prior to treatment. Based on the
   tumor growth inhibition achieved, responders (defined as those with TGI > 60%) and non
25 responders (defined as those with TGI < 6 0%) were identified. Of the 25 tumors evaluated, 10
   were found to be responders (e.g., a hNRG1 Ct value equal to or less than 22.9), and 15 were
   found to be non-responders (Table 1). These groups enabled the identification of a molecular
   marker for AV-203 responsiveness.

   Example 2: Relationship between AV-203 response and NRG1 levels
   [0088]      For the 25 tumors that were evaluated, RNA was prepared from an untreated healthy
   tumor. Flash frozen tumor samples were pulverized using Covaris CryoPrepTM system
 5 (Covaris Inc. Model CP-02). Approximately 30 mg of pulverized tumor material was
   transferred into a 2 mL SafeLock TM tube (Eppendorf, Cat. No. 02236652). One mL of TRIzol,
   (Invitrogen, Cat. No. 15596-026) and one (5 mm) stainless steel shaker bead (Qiagen, Cat. No.
   69989) were added to each tube. The tubes were then placed in racks in the Tissue Lyser IITM
   (Qiagen, Cat. No. 85300) for cell lysis. The samples were shaken for two 30-second cycles.
10 The racks then were rotated and shaken again for two more cycles.
   [0089]      The total RNA (aqueous phase) was extracted from the cell lysate by the addition of
   200 pL chloroform to each sample. The samples were shaken vigorously for 15 seconds and
   centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 15 minutes at 4'C. The upper supernatants (350 PL) were
   transferred to new 2 mL SafeLockTM tube and placed in QIAcubeTM Automated Purification
                                                                                     TM
15 Instrument (Qiagen, Cat. No.9001292) for automated RNA isolation with RNeasy         Mini
   QlAcube Kit (Qiagen, Cat. No. 74116). A DNase I treatment step was included in the RNA
   isolation. The isolated total RNA concentration was measured with NanoDrop TM (Thermo
   Scientific, Model 1000), and the RNA integrity was determined by electrophoresis to verify the
   position of the 18S band and detection of any RNA degradation. The RNA was aliquoted into
20 two 1.7 mL microtubes (Axygen Cat. No. MCT-175-C) and stored at -80'C.
   [0090]      Human NRG1, ERBB3 and p-Actin expression levels were determined using
   quantitative, real-time RT-PCR. Total tumor RNA expression was assayed using QuantiTectTM
   SYBR Green RT PCR Kit (Qiagen Cat. No.204245) and run on a Applied Biosystems
   Thermocycler, Model 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems,
25 Cat.No.4329001). Each RNA tumor sample was assayed in quadruplicate in 20 PL reactions.
   Each reaction contained 50 ng of total tumor RNA, 10pL of 2x QuantiTectTM SYBR Green RT
   PCR Master Mix, 0.2pL QuantiTect RT Mix and forward and reverse gene specific primers
   (synthesized by Eurofins MWG Operon) at final concentration of 900 nM. The reactions setup

                                                - 25
   using Qiagen BioRobot Rapidplate liquid handling system in a 384-well plate (Applied
   Biosystems, Cat. No. 4309849) and sealed with MicroAmp Optical Adhesive Film (Applied
   Biosystems, Cat. No. 4311971). The Real-Time plate was assayed with the following Program:
   30 minutes at 50'C, 15 minutes at 95'C, followed by 40 cycles of 15 seconds at 95'C, 30
 5 seconds at 54'C, 30 seconds at 72'C. Cycle threshold (Ct) value averages were then calculated
   in Microsoft Excel. Ct value is defined as cycle number at the threshold level of log-based
   fluorescence. A low Ct value reflects a high specific RNA level (i.e., a low Ct value reflects
   high expression of NRG1).
   [0091]       AV-203 tumor growth inhibition in these 25 tumors was then plotted against NRG1
10 expression levels (represented as Ct values) within each tumor. As shown in FIG. 12, a
   positive correlation was observed between tumor growth inhibition and NRG1 expression.
   More specifically, increased tumor growth inhibition after treatment with AV-203 correlated
   with increased NRG1 expression (lower Ct value). This correlation was found to be highly
   statistically significant (Table 2).

   Example 3: Relationship between AV-203 response and ERBB3 levels
   [0092]       As described for NRG1, ERBB3 levels were also determined by quantitative RT
20 PCR from these 25 tumor models. AV-203 tumor growth inhibition in these 25 tumors was
   then plotted against ERBB3 expression levels (represented as Ct values) for each tumor. As

                                                -26
   shown in FIG. 13, tumor growth inhibition did not correlate with increased ERBB3 expression,
   even though ERBB3 is the target for AV-203.
   Example 4: NRG1 threshold determination
   [0093]       Using the Ct values for NRG1 from the AV-203 responding (sensitive) and non
 5 responding (resistant) xenograft tumor models, a receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve
   was generated to determine an NRG1 expression threshold useful to predict AV-203 tumor
   response (FIG. 14). In general, a ROC curve is used to determine if the test result (e.g., an
   NRG1 biomarker test result) is significantly different from a random event and to determine the
   optimum threshold score (e.g., an optimum threshold NRG1 score). For example, if the test
10 results are random, a diagonal line would divide the ROC space. In this example, the ROC
   curve is above the diagonal line indicating that the test is achieving a high degree of separation
   between responders and non-responders (FIG. 14). As shown in FIG. 14, the optimum
   threshold is Ct= 22.9, which yields a false positive rate of 0.13, and a false negative rate of 0.2.
   Results of the ROC analysis indicate that AV-203 tumor response can be predicted by high
15 NRG1 expression level, using a cut-off at Ct value 22.9. Using the xenograft tumor models
   listed in Table 1, the Ct value cut-off of 22.9 (e.g., equal to or less than 22.9) predicted AV-203
   response with statistical significance (FIG. 15). As shown in FIG. 15, increased TGI was
   observed following treatment with AV-203 in tumors with a low Ct value (which indicates high
   NRG1 expression and a high NRG1 score).
20 Example 5: Primary human tumor model response
   [0094]       In order to validate this prediction method for response to AV-203, primary human
   tumor models were classified as having high or low NRG1 expression, based on a microarray
   analysis of the primary human tumors. These models were then tested for response to AV-203
   treatment.
25 [0095]       Evaluation of human primary tumor response to AV-203 was performed as follows.
   Primary human tumors were collected from surgical resection. Tumor samples were shipped
   on wet ice overnight in media containing 10% FBS. Upon arrival, tumor samples were cut into
   2 mm x 2 mm fragments and implanted subcutaneously into five NCR nude mice (Taconic)
   using a 10 gauge trocar needle. In order to establish xenograft tumor material to be used for
30 efficacy studies, tumors were collected at 500 mm 3 and propagated further into 20 sites. Once

                                               - 27
   these tumors achieved a size of 500 mm 3 , they were collected for further propagation, efficacy
   studies, and molecular characterization. For efficacy studies, tumor fragments were implanted
   subcutaneously into 8-week old female NCR nude mice. Tumor measurements were taken
   twice weekly, using vernier calipers. Tumor volume was calculated using the formula: width x
 5 width x length/2. When tumors reached approximately 200 mm 3, the mice were randomized
   into two groups of 10 mice each, PBS vehicle control, or AV-203 dosed intraperitoneally (IP)
   at 20 mg/kg twice weekly. In some studies, a second control group was used, which received
   human IgG dosed at 20 mg/kg twice weekly.
   [0096]      In total, xenografts of four primary human lung tumors were treated with AV-203.
10 Two were predicted to respond, and two were predicted not to respond, based on NRG1
   expression ranking of the microarray data. The two NRG 1 high human primary tumors that
   were predicted to respond to AV-203 treatment did respond, displaying significant tumor
   growth inhibition. Data from these sensitive tumors are summarized in FIGS. 16 and 17. The
   two NRG1 low human primary tumors predicted not to respond, did not respond to AV-203
15 treatment. Data from the resistant tumors are summarized in FIGS. 18 and 19. These data
   demonstrated that human primary tumor sensitivity to treatment with AV-203 can be predicted
   on the basis of high NRG1 expression in the tumor.
   Example 6: Xenograft Tumor Model Response to Anti-ERBB3 Antibody AV-203
   [0097]      Two additional xenograft tumors (i.e., a CAL-27 head and neck tumor xenograft
20 and a KYSE 150 esophageal tumor xenograft) were selected for high NRG1 expression based
   on the Ct value cut-off of 22.9 (e.g., equal to or less than 22.9) outlined in Example 4 and,
   therefore, were predicted to respond to AV-203. In addition, an H520 non-small cell lung
   carcinoma (NSCLC) xenograft tumor was selected for low NRG1 expression based on the
   same Ct value cut-off of 22.9 outlined in Example 4 and, therefore, was predicted not to
25 respond to AV-203. All three tumor models were treated with 20 mg/kg of antibody AV-203.
   The response to antibody AV-203 ranged from 75.2-79.9% tumor growth inhibition for the
   sensitive tumors (i.e., CAL-27 and KYSE 150) (TGI, see Table 3 and FIGS. 20-21) and was
   -8.0% TGI for the resistant tumor (i.e., H520) (see Table 3 and FIG. 22).

   [0098]      These data demonstrate that the response of solid tumors to treatment with AV-203
 5 can be predicted by measuring NRG1 expression.
   Example 7: Xenograft Tumor Model Response to Anti-ERBB3 Antibody I1GO1
   [0099]      To validate the prediction method for response to other anti-ERBB3 antibodies,
   tumor models expressing high NRG1 levels were treated with an anti-ERBB3 antibody having
   a different mechanism of action from AV-203. As discussed above, AV-203 inhibits binding
10 of NRG1 to ERBB3, therefore, the following experiment was conducted using an antibody that
   blocks dimerization of ERBB3 without inhibiting binding of NRG1 to ERBB3, i.e., antibody
    1IGO1. Evaluation of tumor response to antibody 1IGO1 was performed as described in
   Example 1.
   [00100]     Three xenograft tumors (i.e., a BxPC3 pancreas tumor xenograft, a DU145 prostate
15 tumor xenograft and an H322 lung tumor xenograft) were selected for high NRG1 expression
   based on the Ct value cut-off of 22.9 (e.g., equal to or less than 22.9) outlined in Example 4
   and, therefore, were predicted to respond to an anti-ERBB3 antibody. All 3 tumor models were
   treated with 20 mg/kg of antibody 11 GO 1. Response to antibody 11 GO 1 ranged from 60-72%
   tumor growth inhibition (TGI, see Table 4 and FIGS. 23-25).

    antibody 11 GO 1. These data demonstrate that the response of solid tumors to treatment with
    anti-ERBB3 antibodies including neutralizing antibodies (e.g., AV-203) and dimerization
    inhibiting antibodies (e.g., antibody 1 IGO1) can be predicted by measuring high hNRG1
