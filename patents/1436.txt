The present invention is related to methods and compositions for diagnosis and treatment of
 amyloidosis, a group of disorders and abnormalities associated with amyloid protein such as
Alzheimer's disease.
Amyloidosis is not a single disease entity but rather a diverse group of progressive disease
processes characterized by extracellular tissue deposits of a waxy, starch-like protein called
amyloid, which accumulates in one or more organs or body systems. As the amyloid deposits
accumulate, they begin to interfere with the normal function of the organ or body system. There
are at least 15 different types of amyloidosis. The major forms are primary amyloidosis without
known antecedent, secondary amyloidosis following some other condition, and hereditary
amyloidosis.
Secondary amyloidosis occurs during chronic infection or inflammatory disease, such as
tuberculosis,   a bacterial   infection called familial  Mediterranean    fever, bone infections
(osteomyelitis), rheumatoid arthritis, inflammation of the small intestine (granulomatous ileitis),
Hodgkin's disease, and leprosy.
Amyloid deposits include amyloid P (pentagonal) component (AP), a glycoprotein related to
normal    serum amyloid P (SAP),         and   sulphated glycosaminoglycans     (GAG),   complex
carbohydrates of connective tissue. Amyloid protein fibrils, which account for about 90% of the
amyloid material, comprise one of several different types of proteins. These proteins are capable
of folding into so-called "beta-pleated" sheet fibrils, a unique protein configuration which
exhibits binding sites for Congo red resulting in the unique staining properties of the amyloid
protein.
Many diseases of aging are based on or associated with amyloid-like proteins and               are
characterized, in part, by the buildup of extracellular deposits of amyloid or amyloid-like
material that contribute to the pathogenesis, as well as the progression of the disease. These
diseases include, but are not limited to, neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's Disease
(AD),    Lewy body dementia, Down's           syndrome,  hereditary cerebral hemorrhage      with
                                                1

    WO 2008/011348                                                          PCT/US2007/073504
amyloidosis (Dutch type); the Guam Parkinson-Dementia complex. Other diseases which are
based on or associated with amyloid-like proteins are progressive supranuclear palsy, multiple
sclerosis; Creutzfeld Jacob disease, Parkinson's disease, HIV-related dementia, ALS (amyotropic
lateral sclerosis), Adult Onset Diabetes; senile cardiac amyloidosis; endocrine tumors, and
others, including macular degeneration.
Although pathogenesis of these diseases may be diverse, their characteristic deposits often
contain many shared molecular constituents. To a significant degree, this may be attributable to
the local activation of pro-inflammatory pathways thereby leading to the concurrent deposition
of activated complement components, acute phase reactants, immune modulators, and other
inflammatory mediators (McGeer et al., 1994).
Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a neurological disorder primarily thought to be caused by amyloid
plaques, an accumulation of abnormal deposit of proteins in the brain. The most frequent type of
amyloid found in the brain of affected individuals is composed primarily of A0 fibrils. Scientific
evidence demonstrates that an increase in the production and accumulation of beta-amyloid
protein in plaques leads to nerve cell death, which contributes to the development and
progression of AD. Loss of nerve cells in strategic brain areas, in turn, causes reduction in the
neurotransmitters and impairment of memory.          The proteins principally responsible for the
plaque build up include amyloid precursor protein (APP) and two presenilins (presenilin I and
presenilin II).     Sequential cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), which is
constitutively expressed and catabolized in most cells, by the enzymes    # and y secretase leads to
the release of a 39 to 43 amino acid A0 peptide. The degradation of APPs likely increases their
propensity to aggregate in plaques. It is especially the A13(1-42) fragment that has a high
propensity of building aggregates due to two very hydrophobic amino acid residues at its C
terminus. The A1(1-42) fragment is therefore believed to be mainly involved and responsible for
the initiation of neuritic plaque formation in AD and to have, therefore, a high pathological
potential. There is therefore a need for agents to prevent the formation of amyloid plaques and to
diffuse existing plaques in AD.
The symptoms of AD manifest slowly and the first symptom may only be mild forgetfulness. In
this stage, individuals may forget recent events, activities, the names of familiar people or things
and may not be able to solve simple math problems. As the disease progresses, symptoms are
                                                2

     WO 2008/011348                                                      PCT/US2007/073504
more easily noticed and become serious enough to cause people with AD or their family
members to seek medical help. Mid-stage symptoms of AD include forgetting how to do simple
 tasks such as grooming, and problems develop with speaking, understanding, reading, or writing.
 Later stage AD patients may become anxious or aggressive, may wander away from home and
ultimately need total care.
Presently, the only definite way to diagnose AD is to identify plaques and tangles in brain tissue
 in an autopsy after death of the individual. Therefore, doctors can only make a diagnosis of
 "possible" or "probable" AD while the person is still alive. Using current methods, physicians
 can diagnose AD correctly up to 90 percent of the time using several tools to diagnose
 "probable" AD.     Physicians ask questions about the person's general health, past medical
problems, and the history of any difficulties the person has carrying out daily activities.
Behavioral tests of memory, problem solving, attention, counting, and language provide
information on cognitive degeneration and medical tests such as tests of blood, urine, or spinal
fluid, and brain scans can provide some further information.
The management of AD consists of medication-based and non-medication based treatments.
Treatments aimed at changing the underlying course of the disease (delaying or reversing the
progression) have so far been largely unsuccessful. Medicines that restore the deficit (defect), or
malfunctioning, in the chemical messengers of the nerve cells (neurotransmitters), in particular
the cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs) such as tacrine and rivastigmine, have been shown to
improve symptoms. ChEIs impede the enzymatic degradation of neurotransmitters thereby
increasing the amount of chemical messengers available to transmit the nerve signals in the
brain.
For some people in the early and middle stages of the disease, the drugs tacrine (COGNEX*,
Morris Plains, NJ), donepezil (ARICEPT*, Tokyo, JP), rivastigmine (EXELON*, East Hanover,
NJ), or galantamine (REMINYL*, New Brunswick, NJ) may help prevent some symptoms from
becoming worse for a limited time. Another drug, memantine (NAMENDA*, New York, NY),
has been approved for treatment of moderate to severe AD. Medications are also available to
address the psychiatric manifestations of AD. Also, some medicines may help control behavioral
symptoms of AD such as sleeplessness, agitation, wandering, anxiety, and depression. Treating
these symptoms often makes patients more comfortable and makes their care easier for
                                              3

 caregivers. Unfortunately, despite significant treatment advances showing that this class of
 agents is consistently better than a placebo, the disease continues to progress, and the average
 effect on mental functioning has only been modest.     Many of the drugs used in AD medication
 such as, for example, ChEIs also have side effects that include gastrointestinal dysfunction, liver
 toxicity and weight loss.
 Another disease that is based on or associated with the accumulation and deposit of amyloid-like
protein is macular degeneration.
 Macular degeneration is a common eye disease that causes deterioration of the macula, which is
the central area of the retina (the paper-thin tissue at the back of the eye where light-sensitive
 cells send visual signals to the brain). Sharp, clear, 'straight ahead' vision is processed by the
macula. Damage to the macula results in the development of blind spots and blurred or distorted
vision. Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a major cause of visual impairment in the
United States and for people over age 65 it is the leading cause of legal blindness among
Caucasians. Approximately 1.8 million Americans age 40 and older have advanced AMD, and
another 7.3 million people with intermediate AMD are at substantial risk for vision loss. The
government estimates that by 2020 there will be 2.9 million people with advanced AMD.
Victims of AMD are often surprised and frustrated to find out how little is known about the
causes and treatment of this blinding condition.
There are two forms of macular degeneration: dry macular degeneration and wet macular
degeneration.    The dry form, in which the cells of the macula slowly begin to break down, is
diagnosed in 85 percent of macular degeneration cases. Both eyes are usually affected by dry
AMD, although one eye can lose vision while the other eye remains unaffected. Drusen, which
are yellow deposits under the retina, are common early signs of dry AMD. The risk of
developing advanced dry AMD or wet AMD increases as the number or size of the drusen
increases. It is possible for dry AMD to advance and cause loss of vision without turning into
the wet form of the disease; however, it is also possible for early-stage dry AMD to suddenly
change into the wet form.
The wet form, although it only accounts for 15 percent of the cases, results in 90 percent of the
blindness, and is considered advanced AMD (there is no early or intermediate stage of wet
AMD). Wet AMD is always preceded by the dry form of the disease. As the dry form worsens,
                                                4

    WO 2008/011348                                                          PCT/US2007/073504
some people begin to have abnormal blood vessels growing behind the macula. These vessels
are very fragile and will leak fluid and blood (hence 'wet' macular degeneration), causing rapid
damage to the macula.
The dry form of AMD will initially often cause slightly blurred vision. The center of vision in
particular may then become blurred and this region grows larger as the disease progresses. No
symptoms may be noticed if only one eye is affected. In wet AMD, straight lines may appear
wavy and central vision loss can occur rapidly.
Diagnosis of macular degeneration typically involves a dilated eye exam, visual acuity test, and a
viewing of the back of the eye using a procedure called fundoscopy to help diagnose AMD,
and-if wet AMD is suspected-fluorescein angiography may also be performed. If dry AMD
reaches the advanced stages, there is no current treatment to prevent vision loss. However, a
specific high dose formula of antioxidants and zinc may delay or prevent intermediate AMD
from progressing to the advanced stage.          Macugen@ (pegaptanib sodium injection), laser
photocoagulation and photodynamic therapy can control the abnormal blood vessel growth and
bleeding in the macula, which is helpful for some people who have wet AMD; however, vision
that is already lost will not be restored by these techniques. If vision is already lost, low vision
aids exist that can help improve the quality of life.
One of the earliest signs of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the accumulation of
extracellular deposits known as drusen between the basal lamina of the retinal pigmented
epithelium (RPE) and Bruch's membrane (BM). Recent studies conducted by Anderson et al.
have confirmed that drusen contains amyloid beta. (Experimental Eye Research 78 (2004) 243
256).
Ongoing research continues with studies exploring environmental, genetic, and dietary factors
that may contribute to AMD. New treatment strategies are also being explored, including retinal
cell transplants, drugs that will prevent or slow down the progress of the disease, radiation
therapy, gene therapies, a computer chip implanted in the retina that may help stimulate vision
and agents that will prevent the growth of new blood vessels under the macula.

 An important factor to consider when developing new drugs is the ease of use for the target
 patients. Oral drug delivery, -specifically tablets, capsules and softgels-, account for 70% of all
 dosage forms consumed because of patient convenience.         Drug developers agree that patients
 prefer oral delivery rather than subjecting themselves to injections or other, more invasive forms
 of medicinal administration. Formulations resulting in low dosing intervals (i.e. once a day or
 sustained release) are also preferable. The ease of administering antibiotics in oral dosage forms
 results in an increase of patient compliance during treatment.
 What is needed are effective methods and compositions for preventing or addressing the
 complications associated with amyloidosis, a group of diseases and disorders associated with
 amyloid plaque formation including secondary amyloidosis and age-related amyloidosis
 including, but not limited to, neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's Disease (AD), Lewy
body dementia, Down's syndrome, hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis (Dutch
type); the Guam Parkinson-Dementia complex; as well as other diseases which are based on or
 associated with amyloid-like proteins such as progressive supranuclear palsy, multiple sclerosis;
 Creutzfeld Jacob disease, Parkinson's disease, HIV-related dementia, ALS (amyotropic lateral
 sclerosis), Adult Onset Diabetes; senile cardiac amyloidosis; endocrine tumors, and others,
including macular degeneration. In particular what is needed are agents capable of counteracting
the physiological manifestations of the disease such as the formation of plaques associated with
aggregation of fibers of the amyloid or amyloid-like peptide.
Anti-amyloid antibodies elicited by the inoculation of AOI-42 mixed with Freund complete or
incomplete adjuvant were reported to reduce the amyloid burden in transgenic mice for human
Alzheimer disease (Schenk et al., 1999). Intraperitoneal inoculation of tetrapalmitoylated A     1 .-
                                                                                                   16
reconstituted in liposomes to NORBA transgenic mice elicited significant titers of anti-amyloid
antibodies, which were reported to solubilize amyloid fibers and plaques in vitro and in vivo.
(Nicolau et al., 2002).
A possible mechanism by which the dissolution of amyloid plaques and fibres occurred was first
suggested by Bard et al., (2000), who concluded that the antibodies opsonized the plaques, which
were subsequently destroyed by the macrophages of the microglia. De Mattos et al., (2001)
indicated that a mAb directed against the central domain of f-amyloid was able to bind and
completely sequester plasma amyloid. They argued that the presence of these mAbs in
                                                6

    WO 2008/011348                                                         PCT/US2007/073504
circulation shifted the equilibrium of AO between brain and plasma, favoring the peripheral
clearing and catabolism instead of deposition within the brain.
Prolonged human therapy with rodent antibodies may result in an antiglobulin response which is
detectable at about 8-12 days after administration and reaches a peak at about 20-30 days. If such
an antiglobulin response is encountered, the treatment must be discontinued after not more than
about 10 days and re-treatment at a latter date is usually precluded because it will lead to rapid
onset of a secondary antiglobulin response. Although rodent antibodies share a considerable
degree of sequence conservation with that of human antibodies, there are many sequence
differences between rodents and human antibodies sufficient for the rodent antibodies to be
immunogenic in humans.
This problem may be overcome by generating antibodies directly in humans or by the creation of
"humanized' (a.k.a. "reshaped' antibodies). Humanized antibodies have a variable region amino
acid sequence that contains the rodent-derived CDRs interspersed into human or human-like
framework sequences. Since the specificity of the humanized antibody is provided by the rodent
derived CDRs, their residues are to be used essentially unchanged with only minor modifications
being allowable, which do not significantly interfere with the affinity and specificity of the
antibody for its target antigen. Framework residues may be derived from any primate or,
particularly, from any human variable region or may be a combination thereof and the resultant
designed variable region would be considered reshaped.
To maximise the likelihood that affinity will be retained in the reshaped antibody it is important
to make a proper selection of the framework region. It is known that the framework sequences
serve to hold the CDRs in their correct spatial orientation for interaction with antigen, and that
framework residues can sometimes even participate in antigen binding. In order to maintain the
affinity of the antibody for its antigen it is advantageous to select human framework sequences
that are most similar to the sequences of the rodent frameworks. It then may still be necessary to
replace one or more amino acids in the human framework sequence with the corresponding
residue in the rodent framework to avoid losses with the affinity. This replacement may be aided
by computer modelling.

In a specific embodiment of the invention, the CDR of non-human origin is obtained from a
donor antibody, but particularly from a murine donor antibody, raised against an antigen
fragment which does not contain said distinct binding site. This shift in the epitopic region may
have at least partially been caused by the use of a supramolecular antigenic construct comprising
an antigenic peptide corresponding to the amino acid sequence of the O-amyloid peptide,
particularly of    -amyloid peptide A01- 16 , modified with a hydrophilic moiety such as, for
example, polyethylene glycol (PEG), wherein said hydrophilic moiety is covalently bound to
each of the termini of the antigenic peptide through at least one, particularly one or two amino
acids such as, for example, lysine, glutamic acid and cysteine or any other suitable amino acid or
amino acid analogue capable of serving as a connecting device for coupling the hydrophilic
moiety to the peptide fragment, as described herein below in the immunization process. When a
PEG is used as the hydrophilic moiety, the free PEG termini are covalently bound to
phosphatidylethanolamine or any other compound suitable to function as the anchoring element,
for example, to embed the antigenic construct in the bilayer of a liposome as described herein.
In particular, the CDR of non-human origin is obtained from a murine donor antibody which
exhibits the characteristic properties of ACI-01-Ab7C2 (also named "mC2" throughout the

parts thereof inhibits the aggregation of the AO monomers and/or AO soluble polymers
 comprising a plurality of said AO monomeric units to high molecular polymeric fibrils by at least

Binding of the antibodies according to the invention and as described herein to amyloidogenic
monomeric and/or polymeric peptides but, particularly, to the amyloid form (1-42) leads to
inhibition of the aggregation of monomeric and/or polymeric amyloidogenic peptides to high
molecular fibrils or filaments. Through the inhibition of the aggregation of amyloidogenic
monomeric and/or polymeric peptides the antibodies according to the present invention are
capable of preventing or slowing down the formation of amyloid plaques, particularly the
amyloid form (1-42), which is know to become insoluble by change of secondary conformation
and to be the major part of amyloid plaques in brains of diseased animals or humans.
The aggregation inhibition potential of the antibody according to the invention may be
determined by any suitable method known in the art, particularly by density-gradient
ultracentrifugation followed by a SDS-PAGE sedimentation analysis on a preformed gradient
and/or by a thioflavin T (Th-T) fluorescent assay.

hours, particularly for 18 hours to 30 hours, more particularly for 24 hours at a temperature of

according to the invention including any functionally equivalent antibody or functional parts
thereof is capable of disaggregating the preformed polymeric fibrils or filaments by at least 24%
at a molar concentration ratio of antibody to A01 -42 of 1:100.
In another specific embodiment of the invention, the antibody, particularly the humanized
antibody according to the invention including any functionally equivalent antibody or functional
parts thereof is capable of disaggregating the preformed polymeric fibrils or filaments by at least
32% at a molar concentration ratio of antibody to A01 -42 of 1:10.
Through the disaggregation of amyloidogenic polymeric fibrils or filaments the antibodies
according to the present invention are capable of preventing or slowing down the formation of
amyloid plaques which leads to an alleviation of the symptoms associated with the disease and a
delay or reversal of its progression.
Accordingly, it is a further embodiment of the invention to provide an antibody, particularly a
humanized antibody, including any functionally equivalent antibody or functional parts thereof
as described herein, which antibody is capable of decreasing the total amount of AO in the brain
of an animal, particularly a mammal, but especially a human suffering from a disease or

high degree of conformational sensitivity.
In particular, the invention relates to a chimeric antibody or a fragment thereof, or a humanized

antibody, upon co-incubation with amyloid monomeric and/or polymeric soluble amyloid
peptides, particularly with O-amyloid monomeric peptides such as, for example, AO monomeric
peptides 1-39; 1-40, 1-41, or 1-42, and/or a polymeric soluble O-amyloid peptide comprising a
plurality of said AO monomeric units, but especially with an Ao1- 42 monomeric and/or an AO
polymeric soluble amyloid peptide comprising a plurality of said Ao 1 -42 monomeric units,,
inhibits the aggregation of the AO monomers into high molecular polymeric fibrils or filaments
and, in addition, upon co-incubation with preformed high molecular polymeric amyloid fibrils or

towards an a-helix and/or a random coil conformation, but particularly a random coil
conformation, even more particularly a random coil conformation at a given location in the
molecule, especially in the environment of Tyr 10 and Val 12 of the AO protein, which leads to an
increase of the random coil conformation at the expense of the /-sheet conformation and an
improved solubilization of the preformed high molecular polymeric amyloid fibrils or filaments.
In particular the decrease of the /-sheet conformation amounts to at least 30%, particularly to at
least 35%, and more particularly to at least 40% and more as compared to the respective
preformed amyloid polymeric fibrils or filaments incubated in buffer (control).
The antibody's potential in inducing a transition in the secondary structure is determined by solid

conformations of Tyr 10 and Val 12 CO in the A0 1-42 peptide.

of at least about 1 x 10~8 M to at least about 2 x 10-8,M' but, preferably, does not show any
significant cross-reactivity with amyloid precursor protein (APP).
In another embodiment of the invention, a chimeric antibody or a fragment thereof, or a
humanized antibody or a fragment thereof according to the present invention and as described
herein before, is provided comprising at least one light chain or a fragment thereof or at least
one heavy chain or a fragment thereof, wherein said antibody or fragment binds to an AO fiber,
fibril or filament with a high binding affinity with a KD in a range of between at least about 1 x
10-7 M to at least about 1 x 10-1 M, particularly of at least about 1 x 10-8 M to at least about 1 x
10-11 M, more particularly of at least about 1 x 10-9 M to at least about 1 x 1040 M, even more
particularly of at least about 2 x 10-9 M to at least about 5 x 10-9 M, but, preferably, does not
show any significant cross-reactivity with amyloid precursor protein (APP).
In another embodiment, the antibody according to the invention and as described herein before
or a fragment thereof, exhibits an binding affinity to an AO fiber, fibril or filament which is at
least 2 times, particularly at least 4 times, particularly at least 10 times, particularly at least 15
times, more particularly at least 20 times, but especially at least 25 times higher than the binding
affinity to an AO monomer.
In still another embodiment, a chimeric antibody or a fragment thereof, or a humanized antibody
or a fragment thereof is provided as described herein before, which antibody substantially binds
to aggregated AO, including AO plaques, in the mammalian, particularly the human brain but,
preferably, does not show any significant cross-reactivity with amyloid precursor protein (APP).
In another aspect of the invention, the chimeric antibody or a fragment thereof, or a humanized
antibody or a fragment thereof is provided as described herein before, which antibody

    WO 2008/011348                                                          PCT/US2007/073504
substantially binds to soluble polymeric amyloid, particularly amyloid       # (AO), including AO
monomers, in the mammalian, particularly the human brain but, preferably, does not show any
significant cross-reactivity with amyloid precursor protein (APP).
Further provided is a chimeric antibody or a fragment thereof, or a humanized antibody or a
fragment thereof according to the invention and as described herein before, which antibody
significantly reduces AO plaque burden in the mammalian, particularly the human brain. This can
be achieved by either binding of the antibody to the plaque or by shifting the equilibrium
between amyloid, particularly amyloid 3 (AO), in its insoluble and aggregated state towards its
soluble form by disaggregating fibers to soluble poly- and monomeric forms by inducing a shift
in conformation and binding and stabilizing the disaggregated and solubilized amyloid forms,
particularly amyloid    /  (AO) forms, in the tissue and/or body fluids, particularly the brain.
Through the activity of the antibody according to the invention the peripheral clearing and
catabolism is thus favored rather than deposition within the tissue and/or body fluids, particularly
the brain. The beneficial effect of the antibody according to the invention can thus be obtained
without binding of the antibody to the plaque.
Through this stabilizing activity, the antibody according to the invention is able to neutralize the
toxic effects of the polymeric and less aggregated soluble amyloid protein, particularly amyloid
/ (AO) protein, in the tissue and/or body fluids. In a specific embodiment of the invention the
antibody according to the invention may thus achieve its beneficial effects without necessarily
binding aggregated amyloid beta in the brain.

immunoglobulin kappa and lambda, alpha, gamma, delta, epsilon and mu constant region genes,
as well as myriad immunoglobulin variable region genes. Light chains are classified as either
kappa or lambda. Heavy chains are classified as gamma, mu, alpha, delta, or epsilon, which in
turn define the immunoglobulin classes, IgG,          IgM,    IgA, IgD and IgE, respectively.      Also
subclasses of the heavy chain are known. For example, IgG heavy chains in humans can be any
of IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4 subclass. The immunoglobulin according to the invention can be
of any class (IgG, IgM, IgD, IgE, IgA and IgY) or subclass (IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgAl and
IgA2) of immunoglobulin molecule.
As used herein "specifically binds" in reference to an antibody means that the antibody binds to
its target antigen with greater affinity that it does to a structurally different antigen(s).
A typical immunoglobulin structural unit is known to comprise a tetramer. Each tetramer is
composed of two identical pairs of polypeptide chains, each pair having one "light" (about 25
kD) and one "heavy" chain (about 50-70 kD). The N-terminus of each chain defines a variable
region of about 100 to 110 or more amino acids primarily responsible for antigen recognition.
The terms variable light chain (VL) and variable heavy chain (VH) refer to these light and heavy
chains respectively.
Antibodies exist as full length intact antibodies or as a number of well-characterized fragments
produced by digestion with various peptidases or chemicals. Thus, for example, pepsin digests
an antibody below the disulfide linkages in the hinge region to produce F(ab') 2, a dimer of Fab
which itself is a light chain joined to VH-CHI by a disulfide bond. The F(ab') 2 may be reduced
under mild conditions to break the disulfide linkage in the hinge region thereby converting the
F(ab') 2 dimer into an Fab' monomer. The Fab' monomer is essentially a Fab fragment with part
of the hinge region (see, Fundamental Immunology, W. E. Paul, ed., Raven Press, N.Y. (1993),
for a more detailed description of other antibody fragments). While various antibody fragments
are defined in terms of the digestion of an intact antibody, one of skill will appreciate that any of
a variety of antibody fragments may be synthesized de novo either chemically or by utilizing
recombinant DNA methodology. Thus, the term antibody, as used herein also includes antibody
fragments either produced by the modification of whole antibodies or synthesized de novo or
antibodies and fragments obtained by using recombinant DNA methodologies.

 "Antibodies" are intended within the scope of the present invention to include monoclonal
antibodies, polyclonal antibodies, chimeric, single chain, bispecific, simianized, human and
humanized antibodies as well as active fragments thereof. Examples of active fragments of
molecules that bind to known antigens include separated light and heavy chains, Fab, Fab/c, Fv,
Fab', and F(ab') 2 fragments, including the products of an Fab immunoglobulin expression library
and epitope-binding fragments of any of the antibodies and fragments mentioned above.
These active fragments can be derived from an antibody of the present invention by a number of
techniques. For example, monoclonal antibodies can be cleaved with an enzyme, such as pepsin,
and subjected to HPLC gel filtration. The appropriate fraction containing Fab fragments can then
be collected and concentrated by membrane filtration and the like. For further description of
general techniques for the isolation of active fragments of antibodies, see for example, Khaw, B.
A. et al. J. Nucl. Med. 23:1011-1019 (1982); Rousseaux et al. Methods Enzymology, 121:663
69, Academic Press, 1986.
Recombinantly made antibodies may be conventional full length antibodies, active antibody
fragments known from proteolytic digestion, unique active antibody fragments such as Fv or
single chain Fv (scFv), domain deleted antibodies, and the like. An Fv antibody is about 50 Kd
in size and comprises the variable regions of the light and heavy chain. A single chain Fv
("scFv") polypeptide is a covalently linked VH::VL heterodimer which may be expressed from a
nucleic acid including VH- and VL-encoding sequences either joined directly or joined by a
peptide-encoding linker. See Huston, et al. (1988) Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA, 85:5879-5883. A
number of structures for converting the naturally aggregated, but chemically separated light and
heavy polypeptide chains from an antibody V region into an scFv molecule which will fold into
a three dimensional structure substantially similar to the structure of an antigen-binding site. See,
e.g. U.S. Patent Nos. 5,091,513, 5,132,405 and 4,956,778.
The combining site refers to the part of an antibody molecule that participates in antigen binding.
The antigen binding site is formed by amino acid residues of the N-terminal variable ("V")
regions of the heavy ("H") and light ("L") chains. The antibody variable regions comprise three
highly divergent stretches referred to as "hypervariable regions" or              "complementarity
determining regions" (CDRs) which are interposed between more conserved flanking stretches
known as "framework regions" (FRs). In an antibody molecule, the three hypervariable regions
                                               56

    WO 2008/011348                                                        PCT/US2007/073504
of a light chain (LCDR1, LCDR2, and LCDR3) and the three hypervariable regions of a heavy
chain (HCDR1, HCDR2 and HCDR3) are disposed relative to each other in three dimensional
space to form an antigen binding surface or pocket.        The antibody combining site therefore
represents the amino acids that make up the CDRs of an antibody and any framework residues
that make up the binding site pocket.
The identity of the amino acid residues in a particular antibody that make up the combining site
can be determined using methods well known in the art. For example, antibody CDRs may be
identified as the hypervariable regions originally defined by Kabat et al. (see, "Sequences of
Proteins of Immunological Interest," E. Kabat et al., U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services; Johnson, G and Wu, TT (2001) Kabat Database and its applications: future directions.
Nucleic Acids Research, 29: 205-206; http://immuno.bme.nwa.edu). The positions of the CDRs
may also be identified as the structural loop structures originally described by Chothia and
others, (see Chothia and Lesk, J. Mol. Biol. 196, 901 (1987), Chothia et al., Nature 342, 877
(1989), and Tramontano et al., J. Mol. Biol. 215, 175 (1990)). Other methods include the "AbM
definition" which is a compromise between Kabat and Chothia and is derived using Oxford
Molecular's AbM antibody modeling software (now Accelrys) or the "contact definition" of
CDRs by Macallum et al., ("Antibody-antigen interactions: contact analysis and binding site
topography," J Mol Biol. 1996 Oct 11;262(5):732-45).        The following chart identifies CDRs
based upon various known definitions.

General guidelines by which one may identify the CDRs in an antibody from sequence alone are
as follows:
         LCDR1:
 Start - Approximately residue 24.
Residue before is always a Cys.
Residue after is always a Trp. Typically TRP is followed with TYR-GLN, but also may be
followed by LEU-GLN, PHE-GLN, or TYR-LEU.
Length is 10 to 17 residues.
         LCDR2:
Start - 16 residues after the end of Li.
Sequence before is generally ILE-TYR, but also may be VAL-TYR, ILE-LYS, or ILE-PHE.
Length is generally 7 residues.
         LCDR3:
Start - generally 33 residues after end of L2.
Residue before is a Cys.
Sequence after is PHE-GLY-X-GLY.
Length is 7 to 11 residues.
         HCDR1:
Start - at approximately residue 26 (four residues after a CYS) [Chothia / AbM definition] Kabat
definition starts 5 residues later.
Sequence before is CYS-X-X-X.
Residues after is a TRP, typically followed by VAL, but also followed by ILE, or ALA.
Length is 10 to 12 residues under AbM definition while Chothia definition excludes the last 4
residues.
         HCDR2:
Start - 15 residues after the end of Kabat /AbM definition of CDR-H 1.

    WO 2008/011348                                                           PCT/US2007/073504
 Sequence before typically LEU-GLU-TRP-ILE-GLY (SEQ ID NO. 1), but a number of
variations are possible.
 Sequence after is LYS/ARG-LEU/ILE/VAL/PHE/THR/ALA-THR/SER/ILE/ALA
Length is 16 to 19 residues under Kabat definition (AbM definition ends 7 residues earlier).
          HCDR3:
 Start -33 residues after end of CDR-H2 (two residues after a CYS).
 Sequence before is CYS-X-X (typically CYS-ALA-ARG).
 Sequence after is TRP-GLY-X-GLY.
Length is 3 to 25 residues.
The identity of the amino acid residues in a particular antibody that are outside the CDRs, but
nonetheless make up part of the combining site by having a side chain that is part of the lining of
the combining site (i.e., it is available to linkage through the combining site), can be determined
using methods well known in the art such as molecular modeling and X-ray crystallography. See
e.g., Riechmann et al., (1988) Nature, 332:;323-327.
Chimeric antibodies are those in which one or more regions of the antibody are from one species
of animal and one or more regions of the antibody are from a different species of animal. A
preferred chimeric antibody is one which includes regions from a primate immunoglobulin. A
chimeric antibody for human clinical use is typically understood to have variable regions from a
non-human animal, e.g. a rodent, with the constant regions from a human. In contrast, a
humanized antibody uses CDRs from the non-human antibody with most or all of the variable
framework regions from and all the constant regions from a human immunoglobulin. A human
chimeric antibody is typically understood to have the variable regions from a rodent. A typical
human chimeric antibody has human heavy constant regions and human light chain constant
regions with the variable regions of both the heavy and light coming from a rodent antibody. A
chimeric antibody may include some changes to a native amino acid sequence of the human
constant regions and the native rodent variable region sequence. Chimeric and humanized
antibodies may be prepared by methods well known in the art including CDR grafting
approaches (see, e.g., U.S. Patent Nos. 5,843,708; 6,180,370; 5,693,762; 5,585,089; 5,530,101),
chain shuffling strategies (see e.g., U.S. Patent No. 5,565,332; Rader et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.
                                                 59

     WO 2008/011348                                                         PCT/US2007/073504
 USA (1998) 95:8910-8915), molecular modeling strategies (U.S. Patent No. 5,639,641), and the
 like.
 A "humanized antibody" as used herein in the case of a two chain antibody is one where at least
 one chain is humanized. A humanized antibody chain has a variable region where one or more
 of the framework regions are human. A humanized antibody which is a single chain is one
 where the chain has a variable region where one or more of the framework regions are human.
 The non-human portions of the variable region of the humanized antibody chain or fragment
 thereof is derived from a non-human source, particularly a non-human antibody, typically of
rodent origin. The non-human contribution to the humanized antibody is typically provided in
 form at least one CDR region which is interspersed among framework regions derived from one
 (or more) human immunoglobulin(s). In addition, framework support residues may be altered to
preserve binding affinity.
The humanized antibody may further comprise constant regions (e.g., at least one constant
region or portion thereof, in the case of a light chain, and preferably three constant regions in the
case of a heavy chain). The constant regions of a humanized antibody if present generally are
human.
Methods to obtain "humanized antibodies" are well known to those skilled in the art. (see, e.g.,
Queen et al., Proc. Natl Acad Sci USA, 86:10029-10032 (1989), Hodgson et al.,
Bio/Technology, 9:421 (1991)).
A "humanized antibody" may also be obtained by a novel genetic engineering approach that
enables production of affinity-matured human-like polyclonal antibodies in large animals such
as, for example, rabbits and mice. See, e.g. U.S. Pat No. 6,632,976.
The term constant region (CR) as used herein refers to constant regions genes of the
immunoglobulin. The constant region genes encode the portion of the antibody molecule which
confers effector functions. For Chimeric human antibodies and humanized antibodies, typically
non-human (e.g., marine), constant regions are substituted by human constant regions. The
constant regions of the subject chimeric or humanized antibodies are typically derived from
human immunoglobulins. The heavy chain constant region can be selected from any of the five
isotypes: alpha, delta, epsilon, gamma or mu. Further, heavy chains of various subclasses (such
                                                60

     WO 2008/011348                                                        PCT/US2007/073504
as the IgG subclasses of heavy chains) are responsible for different effector functions and thus,
by choosing the desired heavy chain constant region, antibodies with desired effector function
can be produced. Constant regions that may be used within the scope of this invention are
gamma 1 (IgGi), particularly an Fc region of the gamma 1 (IgG1) isotype, gamma 3 (IgG3) and
especially gamma 4 (IgG4). The light chain constant region can be of the kappa or lambda type,
preferably of the kappa type. In one embodiment the light chain constant region is the human
kappa constant chain (Heiter et al. (1980) Cell 22:197-207) and the heavy constant chain is the
human IgG4 constant chain.
The term "monoclonal antibody" is also well recognized in the art and refers to an antibody that
is the product of a single cloned antibody producing cell. Monoclonal antibodies are typically
made by fusing a normally short-lived, antibody-producing B cell to a fast-growing cell, such as
a cancer cell (sometimes referred to as an "immortal" cell). The resulting hybrid cell, or
hybridoma, multiplies rapidly, creating a clone that produces the antibody.
For the purpose of the present invention, "monoclonal antibody" is also to be understood to
comprise antibodies that are produced by a mother clone which has not yet reached full
monoclonality.
"Functionally equivalent antibody" is understood within the scope of the present invention to
refer to an antibody which substantially shares at least one major functional property with an
antibody mentioned above and herein described comprising: binding specificity to the -amyloid
protein, particularly to the Aol-42 protein, and more particularly to the 16-21 epitope region of
the Ao3-  42 protein, immunoreactivity in vitro, inhibition of aggregation of the Ao3- 42 monomers
into high molecular polymeric fibrils and/or disaggregation of preformed Aol-42 polymeric
fibrils, and/or a -sheet breaking property and alleviating the effects of amyloidosis, a group of
diseases and disorders associated with amyloid plaque formation including secondary
amyloidosis and age-related amyloidosis such as diseases including, but not limited to,
neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's Disease (AD), Lewy body dementia, Down's
syndrome, hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis (Dutch type); the Guam Parkinson
Dementia complex; as well as other diseases which are based on or associated with amyloid-like
proteins such as progressive supranuclear palsy, multiple sclerosis; Creutzfeld Jacob disease,
Parkinson's disease, HIV-related dementia, ALS (amyotropic lateral sclerosis), Adult Onset

 Diabetes; senile cardiac amyloidosis; endocrine tumors, and others, including macular
 degeneration, when administered prophylactically or therapeutically. The antibodies can be of
 any class such as IgG, IgM, or IgA, etc or any subclass such as IgG1, IgG2a, etc and other
 subclasses mentioned herein above or known in the art, but particularly of the IgG4 class.
 Further, the antibodies can be produced by any method, such as phage display, or produced in
 any organism or cell line, including bacteria, insect, mammal or other type of cell or cell line
 which produces antibodies with desired characteristics, such as humanized antibodies. The
 antibodies can also be formed by combining a Fab portion and an Fe region from different
 species.
The term "hybridize" as used refers to conventional hybridization conditions, preferably to
hybridization conditions at which 5xSSPE, 1% SDS, 1xDenhardts solution is used as a solution
 and/or hybridization temperatures are between 35'C and 70'C, preferably 65'C. After
hybridization, washing is preferably carried out first with 2xSSC, 1% SDS and subsequently
with 0.2xSSC at temperatures between 35'C and 70'C, preferably at 65'C (regarding the
definition of SSPE, SSC and Denhardts solution see Sambrook et al. loc. cit.). Stringent
hybridization conditions as for instance described in Sambrook et al, supra, are particularly
preferred. Particularly preferred stringent hybridization conditions are for instance present if
hybridization and washing occur at 65'C as indicated above. Non-stringent hybridization
conditions, for instance with hybridization and washing carried out at 45'C are less preferred and
at 35'C even less.
"Homology" between two sequences is determined by sequence identity. If two sequences which
are to be compared with each other differ in length, sequence identity preferably relates to the
percentage of the nucleotide residues of the shorter sequence which are identical with the
nucleotide residues of the longer sequence. Sequence identity can be determined conventionally
with the use of computer programs such as the Bestfit program (Wisconsin Sequence Analysis
Package, Version 8 for Unix, Genetics Computer Group, University Research Park, 575 Science
Drive Madison, WI 53711). Bestfit utilizes the local homology algorithm of Smith and
Waterman, Advances in Applied Mathematics 2 (1981), 482-489, in order to find the segment
having the highest sequence identity between two sequences. When using Bestfit or another
sequence alignment program to determine whether a particular sequence has for instance 95%
identity with a reference sequence of the present invention, the parameters are preferably so

     WO 2008/011348                                                        PCT/US2007/073504
adjusted that the percentage of identity is calculated over the entire length of the reference
sequence and that homology gaps of up to 5% of the total number of the nucleotides in the
reference sequence are permitted. When using Bestfit, the so-called optional parameters are
preferably left at their preset ("default") values. The deviations appearing in the comparison
between a given sequence and the above-described sequences of the invention may be caused for
instance by addition, deletion, substitution, insertion or recombination. Such a sequence
comparison can preferably also be carried out with the program "fasta20u66" (version 2.0u66,
September 1998 by William R. Pearson and the University of Virginia; see also W.R. Pearson
(1990),       Methods     in     Enzymology         183, 63-98,     appended      examples      and
http://workbench.sdsc.edu). For this purpose, the "default" parameter settings may be used.
The antibody according to the invention may be an immunoglobulin or antibody, which is
understood to have each of its binding sites identical (if multivalent) or, in the alternative, may
be a "bispecific" or "bifunctional antibody".
A "bispecific" or "bifunctional antibody" is an artificial hybrid antibody having two different
heavy/light chain pairs and two different binding sites. Bispecific antibodies can be produced by
a variety of methods including fusion of hybridomas or linking of Fab' fragments. See, e.g.,
Songsivilai & Lachmann, Clin. Exp. Immunol. 79:315-321 (1990); Kostelny et al., J. Immunol.
148, 1547-1553 (1992).
The term "fragment" refers to a part or portion of an antibody or antibody chain comprising
fewer amino acid residues than an intact or complete antibody or antibody chain. Fragments can
be obtained via chemical or enzymatic treatment of an intact or complete antibody or antibody
chain. Fragments can also be obtained by recombinant means. Exemplary fragments include
Fab, Fab', F(ab')2, Fabc and/or Fv fragments. The term "antigen-binding fragment" refers to a
polypeptide fragment of an immunoglobulin or antibody that binds antigen or competes with
intact antibody (i.e., with the intact antibody from which they were derived) for antigen binding
(i.e., specific binding).
Binding fragments are produced by recombinant DNA techniques, or by enzymatic or chemical
cleavage of intact immunoglobulins.        Binding fragments include Fab, Fab', F(ab')2 , Fabc, Fv,
single chains, and single-chain antibodies.

 "Fragment" also refers to a peptide or polypeptide comprising an amino acid sequence of at least
 5 contiguous amino acid residues, at least 10 contiguous amino acid residues, at least 15
contiguous amino acid residues, at least 20 contiguous amino acid residues, at least 25
contiguous amino acid residues, at least 40 contiguous amino acid residues, at least 50

amino acid residues, at least contiguous 80 amino acid residues, at least contiguous 90 amino
acid residues, at least contiguous 100 amino acid residues, at least contiguous 125 amino acid
residues, at least 150 contiguous amino acid residues, at least contiguous 175 amino acid
residues, at least contiguous 200 amino acid residues, or at least contiguous 250 amino acid
residues of the amino acid sequence of another polypeptide. In a specific embodiment, a
fragment of a polypeptide retains at least one function of the polypeptide.
The term "antigen" refers to an entity or fragment thereof which can bind to an antibody. An
immunogen refers to an antigen which can elicit an immune response in an organism,
particularly an animal, more particularly a mammal including a human.           The term antigen
includes regions known as antigenic determinants or epitopes which refers to a portion of the
antigen (which are contacted or which play a significant role in supporting a contact reside in the
antigen responsible for antigenicity or antigenic determinants.
As used herein, the term "soluble" means partially or completely dissolved in an aqueous
solution.
Also as used herein, the term "immunogenic" refers to substances which elicit the production of
antibodies, T-cells and other reactive immune cells directed against an antigen of the
immunogen.
An immune response occurs when an individual produces sufficient antibodies, T-cells and other
reactive immune cells against administered immunogenic compositions of the present invention
to moderate or alleviate the disorder to be treated.
The term immunogenicity as used herein refers to a measure of the ability of an antigen to elicit

     WO 2008/011348                                                         PCT/US2007/073504
 invention is concerned with approaches that reduce the immunogenicity of the subject human
 chimeric or humanized antibodies.
 Humanized antibody of reduced immunogenicity refers to a humanized antibody exhibiting
 reduced immunogenicity relative to the parent antibody, e.g., the murine antibody.
 Humanized antibody substantially retaining the binding properties of the parent antibody refers
to a humanized antibody which retains the ability to specifically bind the antigen recognized by
the parent antibody used to produce such humanized antibody.             Preferably the humanized
 antibody will exhibit the same or substantially the same antigen-binding affinity and avidity as
the parent antibody. Ideally, the affinity of the antibody will not be less than 10% of the parent
 antibody affinity, more preferably not less than about 30%, and most preferably the affinity will
not be less than 50% of the parent antibody. Methods for assaying antigen-binding affinity are
well known in the art and include half-maximal binding assays, competition assays, and
 Scatchard analysis. Suitable antigen binding assays are described in this application.
A "back mutation" is. a mutation introduced in a nucleotide sequence which encodes a
humanized antibody, the mutation results in an amino acid corresponding to an amino acid in the
parent antibody (e.g., donor antibody, for example, a murine antibody).          Certain framework
residues from the parent antibody may be retained during the humanization of the antibodies of
the invention in order to substantially retain the binding properties of the parent antibody, while
at the same time minimizing the potential immunogenicity of the resultant antibody. In one
embodiment of the invention, the parent antibody is of mouse origin. For example, the back
mutation changes a human framework residue to a parent murine residue.                  Examples of
framework residues that may be back mutated include, but are not limited to, canonical residues,
interface packing residues, unusual parent residues which are close to the binding site, residues
in the "Vernier Zone" (which forms a platform on which the CDRs rest) (Foote & Winter, 1992,
J. Mol. Biol. 224, 487-499), and those close to CDR H3.
As used herein a "conservative           change"   refers to alterations that are substantially
conformationally or antigenically neutral, producing minimal changes in the tertiary structure of
the mutant polypeptides, or producing minimal changes in the antigenic determinants of the
mutant polypeptides, respectively, as compared to the native protein. When referring to the
                                                65

     WO 2008/011348                                                           PCT/US2007/073504
 antibodies and antibody fragments of the invention, a conservative change means an amino acid
 substitution that does not render the antibody incapable of binding to the subject receptor. Those
 of ordinary skill in the art will be able to predict which amino acid substitutions can be made
 while maintaining a high probability of being conformationally and antigenically neutral. Such
 guidance is provided, for example in Berzofsky, (1985) Science 229:932-940 and Bowie et al.
 (1990) Science 247:1306-1310.         Factors to be considered that affect the probability of
 maintaining conformational and antigenic neutrality include, but are not limited to:              (a)
 substitution of hydrophobic amino acids is less likely to affect antigenicity because hydrophobic
 residues are more likely to be located in a protein's interior; (b) substitution of physiochemically
 similar, amino acids is less likely to affect conformation because the substituted amino acid
 structurally mimics the native amino acid; and (c) alteration of evolutionarily conserved
 sequences is likely to adversely affect conformation as such conservation suggests that the amino
 acid sequences may have functional importance. One of ordinary skill in the art will be able to
 assess alterations in protein conformation using well-known assays, such as, but not limited to
microcomplement fixation methods (Wasserman et al. (1961) J. Immunol. 87:290-295; Levine et
 al.   (1967)     Meth.    Enzymol.     11:928-936)     and     through     binding    studies  using
 conformation-dependent monoclonal antibodies (Lewis et al. (1983) Biochem. 22:948-954).
Further, the term "therapeutically effective amount" refers to the amount of antibody which,
when administered to a human or animal, which is sufficient to result in a therapeutic effect in
said human or animal. The effective amount is readily determined by one of skill in the art
following routine procedures.
As used herein, the terms "treat," "prevent," "preventing," and "prevention" refer to the
prevention of the recurrence or onset of one or more symptoms of a disorder in a subject
resulting from the administration of a prophylactic or therapeutic agent.
Construction of Humanized Antibodies
The present invention may be understood more readily by reference to the following detailed
description of specific embodiments included herein. Although the present invention has been
described with reference to specific details of certain embodiments, thereof, it is not intended
that such details should be regarded as limitations upon the scope of the invention.

 The present invention provides novel methods and compositions comprising highly specific and
highly effective antibodies having the ability to specifically recognize and bind to specific
 epitopes from a range of f-amyloid antigens.       The antibodies enabled by the teaching of the
present invention are particularly useful for the treatment of amyloidosis, a group of diseases and
 disorders associated with amyloid plaque formation including secondary amyloidosis and age
related amyloidosis including, but not limited to, neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's
 Disease (AD), Lewy body dementia, Down's syndrome, hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with
 amyloidosis (Dutch type); the Guam Parkinson-Dementia complex; as well as other diseases
which are based on or associated with amyloid-like proteins such as progressive supranuclear
palsy, multiple sclerosis; Creutzfeld Jacob disease, hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with
 amyloidosis Dutch type, Parkinson's disease, HIV-related dementia, ALS (amyotropic lateral
 sclerosis), Adult Onset Diabetes; senile cardiac amyloidosis; endocrine tumors, and others,
including macular degeneration, to name just a few.
A fully humanized or reshaped variable region according to the present invention may be created
within the scope of the invention by first designing a variable region amino acid sequence that
contains non-human-, particularly rodent-derived CDRs, but especially CDRs derived from
murine antibody ACI-01-Ab7C2 (named "mC2" throughout the application and deposited 01
December 2005 with the "Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen GmbH
(DSMZ) in Braunschweig, Mascheroder Weg 1 B, 38124 Branuschweig, under the provisions of
the Budapest Treaty and given accession no DSM ACC2750) embedded in human-derived
framework sequences. The non-human-, particularly the rodent-derived CDRs, which may be
obtained from the antibody according to the present invention, provide the desired specificity.
Accordingly, these residues are to be included in the design of the reshaped variable region
essentially unchanged. Any modifications should thus be restricted to a minimum and closely
watched for changes in the specificity and affinity of the antibody. On the other hand, framework
residues in theory can be derived from any human variable region.
In order to create a reshaped antibody which shows an acceptable or an even improved affinity, a
human framework sequences should be chosen, which is equally suitable for creating a reshaped
variable region and for retaining antibody affinity.

    WO 2008/011348                                                       PCT/US2007/073504
In order to achieve this goal, the best-fit strategy was developed. As it is known that the
framework sequences serve to hold the CDRs in their correct spatial orientation for interaction
with antigen, and that framework residues can sometimes even participate in antigen binding,
this strategy aims at minimizing changes that may negatively effect the three-dimensional
structure of the antibody by deriving the human framework sequence used for antibody
reshaping from the human variable region that is most homologous or similar to the non-human-,
particularly the rodent-derived variable region. This will also maximise the likelihood that
affinity will be retained in the reshaped antibody.
At its simplest level, the "best fit" strategy involves comparing the donor rodent V-region with
all known human V-region amino acid sequences, and then selecting the most homologous to
provide the acceptor framework regions for the humanization exercises. In reality there are
several other factors which should be considered, and which may influence the final selection of
acceptor framework regions. Molecular modelling predictions may be used in this regard prior
to any experimental work in an attempt to maximise the affinity of the resultant reshaped
antibody. Essentially, the goal of the modelling is to predict which key residues (if any) of the
most homologous human framework should be left as in the rodent to obtain the best affinity in
the reshaped antibody.
In one embodiment of the invention, the CDRs are obtainable from mouse monoclonal antibody,
particularly from mouse monoclonal antibody ACI-01-Ab7C2 (named "mC2" throughout the
application) described in co-pending application EP 05 02 7092.5 filed 12.12.2005, the
disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.
Hybridoma cells FP-12H3-C2, producing mouse monoclonal antibody ACI-01-Ab7C2 (named
"mC2" and hC2 for the humanized C2 antibody, throughout the application) were deposited 01
December 2005 in co-pending application no EP05027092.5 with the "Deutsche Sammlung von

The mouse antibody may be raised against a supramolecular antigenic construct comprising an
antigenic peptide corresponding to the amino acid sequence of the              -amyloid peptide,

 particularly of -amyloid peptide A0 1 .15 , AO1.16 and   A01.16(Ai4), modified with a hydrophobic
moiety such as, for example, palmitic acid or a hydrophilic moiety such as, for example,
polyethylene glycol (PEG) or a combination of both, wherein the hydrophobic and hydrophilic
moiety, respectively, is covalently bound to each of the termini of the antigenic peptide through
 at least one, particularly one or two amino acids such as, for example, lysine, glutamic acid and
 cysteine or any other suitable amino acid or amino acid analogue capable of serving as a
 connecting device for coupling the hydrophobic and hydrophilic moiety to the peptide fragment.
When a PEG is used as the hydrophilic moiety, the free PEG termini is covalently bound to
phosphatidylethanolamine or any other compound suitable to function as the anchoring element,
 for example, to embed the antigenic construct in the bilayer of a liposome.
In particular, a mouse antibody may be raised against a supramolecular antigenic construct
comprising an antigenic peptide corresponding to the amino acid sequence of the g-amyloid
peptide Ao 1.16 modified with a hydrophilic moiety such as, for example, polyethylene glycol
(PEG) hydrophilic moiety is covalently bound to each of the termini of the antigenic peptide
through at least one, particularly one or two amino acids such as, for example, lysine, glutamic
acid and cysteine or any other suitable amino acid or amino acid analogue capable of serving as a
connecting device for coupling the hydrophobic and hydrophilic moiety to the peptide fragment.
When a PEG is used as the hydrophilic moiety, the free PEG termini are covalently bound to
phosphatidylethanolamine or any other compound suitable to function as the anchoring element,
for example, to embed the antigenic construct in the bilayer of a liposome.
In an embodiment of the invention, a chimeric antibody or a fragment thereof, or a humanized
antibody or a fragment thereof is provided which comprises in the variable region at least one
CDR of non-human origin embedded in one or more human- or primate-derived framework
regions and combined with a constant region derived from a human or primate source antibody,
which chimeric antibody or a fragment thereof, or a humanized antibody or a fragment thereof is
capable of specifically recognizing and binding g-amyloid monomeric peptide.
The CDRs contain the residues most likely to bind antigen and must be retained in the reshaped
antibody. CDRs are defined by sequence according to Kabat et al., Sequence of Proteins of
Immunological Interest,      5 th Edition, The United States Department of Health and Human
Services, The United States Government Printing Office, 1991. CDRs fall into canonical classes
                                                69

     WO 2008/011348                                                       PCT/US2007/073504
(Chothia et al, 1989 Nature, 342, 877-883) where key residues determine to a large extent the
structural conformation of the CDR loop. These residues are almost always retained in the
reshaped antibody.
In the process for preparing a humanized antibody according to the invention, the amino acid
sequences of the C2 heavy chain and light chain variable regions (VH and VK) are compared to
rodent antibody VH and VK sequences in the NCBI and Kabat databases.
The closest match mouse germ line gene to C2 VK is bbl, Locus MMU231201, (Schable et al,
 1999). A comparison reveals that two amino acids differ from this germ line sequence, both
located within CDRL1. Mature murine antibodies with similar, but not identical, sequence can
be found. Several have an identical CDRL2 and identical CDRL3, but the CDRL1 of C2 seems
to be unique. Comparison with human germ line VK sequences shows that genes from subgroup
VKII are the best match for C2 VK (Cox et al, 1994).      C2 VK can thus be assigned to Kabat
subgroup MuVKII. Sequence.
DPK15 together with the human J region HuJK1 may be selected to provide the acceptor
framework sequences for the humanized VK.
The residues at the interface between the variable light and heavy chains have been defined
(Chothia et al, 1985 J. Mol. Biol., 186, 651-663). These are usually retained in the reshaped
antibody. The Phe at position 87 of mouse C2 VK is unusual at the interface, where a Tyr is more
common in the VKII subgroup, indicating that this framework residue may be important for
antibody activity. Tyr 87 is present in the human germline and humanized C2VK.
The humanized VK sequences thus may be designed such that the C2HuVK1 consists of mouse
C2 VK CDRs with frameworks from DPK 15 and human JK1. In a specific embodiment of the
invention, murine residues may be substituted in the human framework region at positions 45,
and/or 87. In the CDR2 region obtainable from a mouse monoclonal antibody, particularly
murine antibody ACI-01-Ab7C2, amino acid substitutions may be made at Kabat positions 50
and/or 53. Residue 45 may be involved in supporting the conformation of the CDRs. Residue 87
is located at the interface of the VH and VK domains. Therefore these residues may be critical for
maintenance of antibody binding.

     WO 2008/011348                                                        PCT/US2007/073504
 The closest match mouse germ line gene to C2 VH AF is VH7183, Locus AF120466, (Langdon
 et al, 2000). Comparison with human germ line VH sequences shows that genes from subgroup
 VHIII are the best match for C2 VH. C2 VH AF can be assigned to Kabat subgroup MuVHIIID.
 Sequence DP54 together with the human J region HuJH6 can be selected to provide the acceptor
 framework sequences for the humanized VH.
 The comparison shows that there are nine amino acid differences between the C2 VH sequences
 and the human acceptor germ line sequence DP54 and JH6, most being located within CDRH2.
 Mature murine antibodies with identical or similar (one residue different) CDRH1 or with
 similar CDRH2 (one residue different) are found, but none with all three CDRs identical to C2
 VH  AF. CDRH3 of C2 antibody is unusually short, consisting of only three residues. However,
 other antibodies are found in the database with CDRH3 of this length. Residue 47 of C2 VH is
 Leu rather than the more common Trp, and residue 94 is Ser rather than the normal Arg,
 indicating that these framework residues may be important for antibody activity.
 Various humanized VH sequences may be designed. C2HuVH1 consists of C2 VH AF CDRs
with frameworks from DP54 and HuJH6.           In a specific embodiment of the invention, murine
residues may be substituted in the human framework region at positions 47 or 94 or both.
Residue 47 in framework 2 makes contact both with the CDRs and with the VK domain. Residue
 94 may be involved in supporting the conformation of the CDRs. Therefore these residues may
be critical for maintenance of antibody binding.
Different HCVR and LCVR regions may be designed which comprise the non-human CDRs
obtainable from the donor antibody, for example, a murine antibody, embedded into the native or
modified human- or primate-derived framework regions. The modification may particularly
concern an exchange of one or more amino acid residues within the framework region by non
human residues, particularly murine residues, more commonly found in this position in the
respective subgroups or by residues which have similar properties to the ones more commonly
found in this position in the respective subgroups.
The modification of the framework region the framework sequences serve to hold the CDRs in
their correct spatial orientation for interaction with antigen, and that framework residues can
sometimes even participate in antigen binding. In one embodiment of the invention measures are

taken to further adapt the selected human framework sequences to make them most similar to the
sequences of the rodent frameworks in order to maximise the likelihood that affinity will be
retained in the reshaped antibody.
Accordingly, murine residues in the human framework region may be substituted. In particular,
murine residues may be substituted in the human framework region of the Heavy Chain Variable
(HCVR) region at positions 47 or 94 or both and in the human framework region of the Light
Chain Variable (LCVR) region at positions 45 and/or 87. In the CDR2 region obtainable from a
mouse monoclonal antibody, particularly murine antibody ACI-01-Ab7C2,                  amino acid
substitutions may be made at Kabat positions 50 and/or 53..
The residues found in the above indicated positions in the human framework region may be
exchanged by murine residues more commonly found in this position in the respective
subgroups. In particular, the Trp in Kabat position 47 in the human- or primate-derived
framework region of the Heavy Chain Variable Region as shown in SEQ ID NO: 15 may be
replaced by an Leu or by an amino acid residue that has similar properties and the substitution of
which leads to alterations that are substantially conformationally or antigenically neutral,
producing minimal changes in the tertiary structure of the mutant polypeptides, or producing
minimal changes in the antigenic determinants. In particular, the Trp in Kabat position 47 in the
human- or primate-derived framework region of the Heavy Chain Variable Region as shown in
SEQ ID NO: 15 may further be replaced by an amino acid selected from the group consisting of
norleucine, Ile, Val, Met, Ala, and Phe, particularly by Ile. Alternative conservative substitutions
may be contemplated which are conformationally and antigenically neutral.
The Arg in Kabat position 94 in the human- or primate-derived framework region of the Heavy
Chain Variable Region as shown in SEQ ID NO: 15 may be replaced by Ser or by an amino acid
residue that has similar properties and the substitution of which leads to alterations that are
substantially conformationally or antigenically neutral, producing minimal changes in the tertiary
structure of the mutant polypeptides, or producing minimal changes in the antigenic
determinants. In particular, the Arg in Kabat position 94 in the human- or primate-derived
framework region of the Heavy Chain Variable Region as shown in SEQ ID NO: 15 may
alternatively be replaced by Thr.

 In another embodiment of the invention, both residues may be replaced in the humanized
 antibody.
 The Gln in Kabat position 45 in the human- or primate-derived framework region of the Light
 Chain Variable Region as shown in SEQ ID NO: 12 may be replaced by Lys or by an amino acid
 residue that has similar properties and the substitution of which leads to alterations that are
 substantially conformationally or antigenically neutral, producing minimal changes in the tertiary
 structure of the mutant polypeptides, or producing minimal changes in the antigenic
 determinants. In particular, the Gln in Kabat position 45 in the human- or primate-derived
 framework region of the Light Chain Variable Region as shown in SEQ ID NO: 12 may be
replaced by an amino acid selected from the group consisting of Arg, Gln, and Asn, particularly
by Arg.
The Leu in Kabat position 50 in the human- or primate-derived framework region of the Light
 Chain Variable Region as shown in SEQ ID NO: 12 may be replaced by Lys or by an amino acid
residue that has similar properties and the substitution of which leads to alterations that are
 substantially conformationally or antigenically neutral, producing minimal changes in the tertiary
structure of the mutant polypeptides, or producing minimal changes in the antigenic
determinants. In particular, the Leu in Kabat position 50 in the human- or primate-derived
framework region of the Light Chain Variable Region as shown in SEQ ID NO: 12 may be
replaced by an amino acid selected from the group consisting of Arg, Gln, and Asn, particularly
by Arg.
The Asn in Kabat position 53 in the human- or primate-derived framework region of the Light
Chain Variable Region as shown in SEQ ID NO: 12 may be replaced by His and Gln or by an
amino acid residue that has similar properties and the substitution of which leads to alterations
that are substantially conformationally or antigenically neutral, producing minimal changes in
the tertiary structure of the mutant polypeptides, or producing minimal changes in the antigenic
determinants. In particular, the Asn in Kabat position 53 in the human- or primate-derived
framework region of the Light Chain Variable Region as shown in SEQ ID NO: 12 may be
replaced by an amino acid selected from the group consisting of Gln, His, Lys and Arg.
The Thr in Kabat position 87 in the human- or primate-derived framework region of the Light
Chain Variable Region as shown in SEQ ID NO: 12 may be replaced by Phe or by an amino acid

     WO 2008/011348                                                      PCT/US2007/073504
residue that has similar properties and the substitution of which leads to alterations that are

structure of the mutant polypeptides, or producing minimal changes in the antigenic
determinants. In particular, the Tyr in Kabat position 87 in the human- or primate-derived
framework region of the Light Chain Variable Region as shown in SEQ ID NO: 12 may be
replaced by an amino acid selected from the group consisting of Leu, Val, Ile, and Ala,
particularly by Leu.
The so obtained variable region comprising at least one CDR of non-human origin embedded in
one or more human- or primate-derived framework regions may then be combined with a
constant region derived from a human or primate source antibody, particularly with human IgG4
or K constant regions respectively. The IgG4 constant region may be modified by, for example,
changing Serine at position 228 in the hinge region to Proline (HuIgG4 Ser-Pro). This mutation
stabilizes the interchain disulphide bond and prevents the formation of half molecules that may
occur in native human IgG4 preparations. The IgG4 constant region may be further modified by
deletion of the terminal Lys in position 439 as shown in SEQ ID NO: 16.
The modified variable regions may be constructed by method known in the art such as, for
example overlapping PCR recombination. The expression cassettes for the chimeric antibody,
C2 ChVH AF and C2 ChVK, may be used as templates for mutagenesis of the framework regions
to the required sequences. Sets of mutagenic primer pairs are synthesized encompassing the
regions to be altered. The humanized VH and VK expression cassettes produced may be cloned
into appropriate cloning vectors know in the art such as, for example, pUC19. After the entire
DNA sequence is confirmed to be correct for each VH and VK, the modified heavy and light
chain V-region genes can be excised from the cloning vector as expression cassettes. These can
then be transferred to appropriate expression vectors such as pSVgpt and pSVhyg which include
human IgG4 Ser-Pro or K constant regions respectively.
EXPRESSION VECTORS
Expression vector pSVgpt is based on pSV 2gpt (Mulligan and Berg, 1980) and includes the
ampicillin resistance gene for selection in bacterial cells, the gpt gene for selection in
mammalian cells, the murine heavy chain immunoglobulin enhancer region, genomic sequence

encoding the constant region gene and SV40 poly A sequences. The heavy chain variable region
for expression is inserted as a HindIII to BamHI fragment.
Expression vector pSVhyg includes the ampicillin resistance gene for selection in bacterial cells,
the hyg gene for selection in mammalian cells, the murine heavy chain immunoglobulin
enhancer region, genomic sequence encoding the kappa constant region gene and including the
kappa enhancer and SV40 poly A sequences. The light chain variable region for expression is
inserted as a HindIII to BamHI fragment.
The DNA sequence is then to be confirmed to be correct for the humanized VH and VK in the
expression vectors.
For antibody production the humanized heavy and light chain expression vectors may be
introduced into appropriate production cell lines know in the art such as, for example, NSO cells.
Introduction    of the   expression   vectors may be     accomplished    by    co-transfection via
electroporation or any other suitable transformation technology available in the art. Antibody
producing cell lines can then be selected and expanded and humanized antibodies purified. The
purified antibodies can then be analyzed by standard techniques such as SDS-PAGE.
ANTIBODY WITH IMPROVED AFFINITY, SPECIFICITY, STABILITY
The CDRL2 sequence ("KVSNRFS") of the mouse C2 antibody may be modified slightly
without adversely affecting antibody activity. Conservative substitutions may be made through
exchange of R for K at position 50 and S for N at position 53. The two alternative CDRL2
sequences are therefore "RVSNRFS" and "KVSSRFS", respectively. These are incorporated
into the murine VK sequence with no other changes, as C2 VK-R and C2 VK-S, respectively.
The affinity, specificity and stability of an antibody according to the invention as described
herein before or a fragment thereof can be modified by change of its glycosylation profile or
pattern resulting in improved therapeutic values.
To achieve this change in glycosylation pattern, host cells may be engineered such that they are
capable of expressing a preferred range of a glycoprotein-modifying glycosyl transferase activity
which increases complex N-linked oligosaccharides carrying bisecting GIcNAc. Further,

PHARMACEUTICAL PREPARATION AND ADMINISTRATION
The antibodies according to the invention, but particularly a monoclonal antibody according the
invention, can be prepared in a physiologically acceptable formulation and may comprise a
pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, diluent and/or excipient using known techniques.          For
example, the antibody according to the invention and as described herein before including any
functionally equivalent antibody or functional parts thereof, in particular, the monoclonal
antibody including any functionally equivalent antibody or functional parts thereof is combined
with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, diluent and/or excipient to form a therapeutic
composition. Suitable pharmaceutical carriers, diluents and/or excipients are well known in the
art and include, for example, phosphate buffered saline solutions, water, emulsions such as
oil/water emulsions, various types of wetting agents, sterile solutions, etc.
Formulation of the pharmaceutical composition according to the invention can be accomplished
according to standard methodology know to those skilled in the art.
The compositions of the present invention may be administered to a subject in the form of a
solid, liquid or aerosol at a suitable, pharmaceutically effective dose. Examples of solid
compositions include pills, creams, and implantable dosage units. Pills may be administered
orally.   Therapeutic creams may be administered topically. Implantable dosage units may be
administered locally, for example, at a tumor site, or may be implanted for systematic release of
the therapeutic composition, for example, subcutaneously. Examples of liquid compositions
include formulations adapted for injection intramuscularly, subcutaneously, intravenously, intra
arterially, and formulations for topical and intraocular administration. Examples of aerosol
formulations include inhaler formulations for administration to the lungs.

The compositions may be administered by standard routes of administration. In general, the
composition may be administered by topical, oral, rectal, nasal, interdermal, intraperitoneal, or
parenteral (for example, intravenous, subcutaneous, or intramuscular) routes. In addition, the
composition may be incorporated into sustained release matrices such as biodegradable
polymers, the polymers being implanted in the vicinity of where delivery is desired, for example,
at the site of a tumor. The method includes administration of a single dose, administration of
repeated doses at predetermined time intervals, and sustained administration for a predetermined
period of time.
A sustained release matrix, as used herein, is a matrix made of materials, usually polymers which
are degradable by enzymatic or acid/base hydrolysis or by dissolution. Once inserted into the
body, the matrix is acted upon by enzymes and body fluids.             The sustained release matrix
desirably is chosen by biocompatible materials such as liposomes, polylactides (polylactide
acid), polyglycolide (polymer of glycolic acid), polylactide co-glycolide (copolymers of lactic
acid and glycolic acid), polyanhydrides, poly(ortho)esters, polypeptides, hyaluronic acid,
collagen, chondroitin sulfate, carboxylic acids, fatty acids, phospholipids, polysaccharides,
nucleic acids, polyamino acids, amino acids such phenylalanine, tyrosine, isoleucine,
polynucleotides, polyvinyl propylene, polyvinylpyrrolidone            and silicone.     A preferred
biodegradable matrix is a matrix of one of either polylactide, polyglycolide, or polylactide co
glycolide (co-polymers of lactic acid and glycolic acid).
It is well know to those skilled in the pertinent art that the dosage of the composition will depend
on various factors such as, for example, the condition of being treated, the particular composition
used, and other clinical factors such as weight, size, sex and general health condition of the
patient, body surface area, the particular compound or composition to be administered, other
drugs being administered concurrently, and the route of administration.
The composition may be administered in combination with other compositions comprising an
biologically active substance or compound, particularly at least one compound selected from the
group consisting of compounds against oxidative stress, anti-apoptotic compounds, metal
chelators, inhibitors of DNA         repair such as pirenzepin and metabolites, 3-amino-i
propanesulfonic acid (3APS), 1,3-propanedisulfonate (1,3PDS), c-secretase activators, 0- and y

derivative, together with an antibody according to the present invention and, optionally, a
pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and/or a diluent and/or an excipient and procedures for the
treatment of diseases.
Proteinaceous pharmaceutically active matter may be present in amounts between 1 ng and 10
mg per dose. Generally, the regime of administration should be in the range of between 0.1 pg
and 10 mg of the antibody according to the invention, particularly in a range 1.0 pg to 1.0 mg,
and more particularly in a range of between 1.0 pg and 100 pg, with all individual numbers
falling within these ranges also being part of the invention. If the administration occurs through
continuous infusion a more proper dosage may be in the range of between 0.01 pg and 10 mg
units per kilogram of body weight per hour with all individual numbers falling within these
ranges also being part of the invention.
Administration will generally be parenterally, eg intravenously. Preparations for parenteral
administration include sterile aqueous or non-aqueous solutions, suspensions and emulsions.
Non-aqueous solvents include without being limited to it, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol,
vegetable oil such as olive oil, and injectable organic esters such as ethyl oleate. Aqueous
solvents may be chosen from the group consisting of water, alcohol/aqueous solutions,
emulsions or suspensions including saline and buffered media. Parenteral vehicles include
sodium chloride solution, Ringer's dextrose, dextrose and sodium chloride, lactated Ringer's, or
fixed oils. Intravenous vehicles include fluid and nutrient replenishers, electrolyte replenishers
(such as those based on Ringer's dextrose) and others. Preservatives may also be present such as,
for example, antimicrobials, anti-oxidants, chelating agents, inert gases, etc.

The pharmaceutical composition may further comprise proteinaceous carriers such as, for
example, serum albumin or immunoglobulin, particularly of human origin. Further biologically
active agents may be present in the pharmaceutical composition of the invention dependent on its
the intended use.
When the binding target is located in the brain, certain embodiments of the invention provide for
the antibody or active fragment thereof to traverse the blood-brain barrier. Certain
neurodegenerative diseases are associated with an increase in permeability of the blood-brain
barrier, such that the antibody or active fragment thereof can be readily introduced to the brain.
When the blood-brain barrier remains intact, several art-known approaches exist for transporting
molecules across it, including, but not limited to, physical methods, lipid-based methods, and
receptor and channel-based methods.
Physical methods of transporting the antibody or active fragment thereof across the blood-brain
barrier include, but are not limited to, circumventing the blood-brain barrier entirely, or by
creating openings in the blood-brain barrier. Circumvention methods include, but are not limited
to, direct injection into the brain (see, e.g., Papanastassiou et al., Gene Therapy 9: 398-406
(2002)) and implanting a delivery device in the brain (see, e.g., Gill et al., Nature Med. 9: 589
595 (2003); and Gliadel Wafers TM, Guildford Pharmaceutical). Methods of creating openings in
the barrier include, but are not limited to, ultrasound (see, e.g., U.S. Patent Publication No.
2002/0038086), osmotic pressure (e.g., by administration of hypertonic mannitol (Neuwelt, E.
A., Implication of the Blood-Brain Barrier and its Manipulation, Vols 1 & 2, Plenum Press, N.Y.
(1989))), permeabilization by, e.g., bradykinin or permeabilizer A-7 (see, e.g., U.S. Patent Nos.
5,112,596, 5,268,164, 5,506,206, and 5,686,416), and transfection of neurons that straddle the
blood-brain barrier with vectors containing genes encoding the antibody or antigen-binding
fragment (see, e.g., U.S. Patent Publication No. 2003/0083299).
Lipid-based methods of transporting the antibody or active fragment thereof across the blood
brain barrier include, but are not limited to, encapsulating the antibody or active fragment thereof
in liposomes that are coupled to antibody binding fragments that bind to receptors on the
vascular endothelium of the blood-brain barrier (see, e.g., U.S. Patent Application Publication
No. 20020025313), and coating the antibody or active fragment thereof in low-density

 Receptor and channel-based methods of transporting the antibody or active fragment thereof
 across the blood-brain barrier include, but are not limited to, using glucocorticoid blockers to
 increase permeability of the blood-brain barrier (see, e.g., U.S. Patent Application Publication
 Nos. 2002/0065259, 2003/0162695, and 2005/0124533); activating potassium channels (see,
 e.g., U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2005/0089473), inhibiting ABC drug transporters
 (see, e.g., U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2003/0073713); coating antibodies with a
 transferrin and modulating activity of the one or more transferrin receptors (see, e.g., U.S. Patent
 Application Publication No. 2003/0129186), and cationizing the antibodies (see, e.g., U.S. Patent
No. 5,004,697).
DETECTION/DIAGNOSIS
In a further embodiment the present invention provides methods and kits for the detection and
diagnosis of amyloid-associated         diseases or conditions. These methods include known
immunological methods commonly used for detecting or quantifying substances in biological
samples or in an in situ condition.
Diagnosis of an amyloid-associated disease or condition in a patient may be achieved by
detecting the immunospecific binding of a monoclonal antibody or an active fragment thereof to
an epitope of the amyloid protein in a sample or in situ, which includes bringing the sample or a
specific body part or body area suspected to contain the amyloid protein into contact with an
antibody which binds an epitope of the amyloid protein, allowing the antibody to bind to the
amyloid protein to form an immunological               complex,   detecting the formation      of the
immunological complex and correlating the presence or absence of the immunological complex
with the presence or absence of amyloid protein in the sample or specific body part or area.
Biological samples that may be used in the diagnosis of an amyloid-associated disease or
condition are, for example, fluids such as serum, plasma, saliva, gastric secretions, mucus,
cerebrospinal fluid, lymphatic fluid and the like or tissue or cell samples obtained from an
organism such as neural, brain, cardiac or vascular tissue. For determining the presence or
                                                 80

     WO 2008/011348                                                         PCT/US2007/073504
absence of the amyloid protein in a sample any immunoassay known to those of ordinary skill in
the art. (See Harlow and Lane, Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual (Cold Spring Harbor
Laboratory, New York 1988 555-612) may be used such as, for example, assays which utilize
indirect   detection   methods    using    secondary    reagents   for  detection,  ELISA's   and
immunoprecipitation and agglutination assays. A detailed description of these assays is, for
example, given in W096/13590 to Maertens and Stuyver, Zrein et al. (1998) and W096/29605.
For in situ diagnosis, the antibody or any active and functional part thereof may be administered
to the organism to be diagnosed by methods known in the art such as, for example, intravenous,
intranasal, intraperitoneal, intracerebral, intraarterial injection such that a specific binding
between the antibody according to the invention with an eptitopic region on the amyloid protein
may occur. The antibody/antigen complex may be detected through a label attached to the
antibody or a functional fragment thereof.
The immunoassays used in diagnostic applications typically rely on labelled antigens, antibodies,
or secondary reagents for detection. These proteins or reagents can be labelled with compounds
generally known to those skilled in the art including enzymes, radioisotopes, and fluorescent,
luminescent and chromogenic substances including colored particles, such as colloidal gold and
latex beads. Of these, radioactive labelling can be used for almost all types of assays and with
most variations. Enzyme-conjugated labels are particularly useful when radioactivity must be
avoided or when quick results are needed. Fluorochromes, although requiring expensive
equipment for their use, provide a very sensitive method of detection. Antibodies useful in these
assays include monoclonal antibodies, polyclonal antibodies, and affinity purified polyclonal
antibodies.
Alternatively, the antibody may be labelled indirectly by reaction with labelled substances that
have an affinity for immunoglobulin, such as protein A or G or second antibodies. The antibody
may be conjugated with a second substance and detected with a labelled third substance having
an affinity for the second substance conjugated to the antibody. For example, the antibody may
be conjugated to biotin and the antibody-biotin conjugate detected using labelled avidin or
streptavidin. Similarly, the antibody may be conjugated to a hapten and the antibody-hapten
conjugate detected using labelled anti-hapten antibody.

    WO 2008/011348                                                       PCT/US2007/073504
Those of ordinary skill in the art will know of these and other suitable labels which may be
employed in accordance with the present invention. The binding of these labels to antibodies or
fragments thereof can be accomplished using standard techniques commonly known to those of
ordinary skill in the art. Typical techniques are described by Kennedy, J. H., et al.,1976 (Clin.
Chim. Acta 70:1-3 1), and Schurs, A. H. W. M., et al. 1977 (Clin. Chim Acta 81:1-40). Coupling
techniques mentioned in the latter are the glutaraldehyde method, the periodate method, the
dimaleimide method, and others, all of which are incorporated by reference herein.
Current immunoassays utilize a double antibody method for detecting the presence of an analyte,
wherein. The antibody is labeled indirectly by reactivity with a second antibody that has been
labeled with a detectable label. The second antibody is preferably one that binds to antibodies of
the animal from which the monoclonal antibody is derived. In other words, if the monoclonal
antibody is a mouse antibody, then the labeled, second antibody is an anti-mouse antibody. For
the monoclonal antibody to be used in the assay described below, this label is preferably an
antibody-coated bead, particularly a magnetic bead. For the polyclonal antibody to be employed
in the immunoassay described herein, the label is preferably a detectable molecule such as a
radioactive, fluorescent or an electrochemiluminescent substance.
An alternative double antibody system often referred to as fast format systems because they are
adapted to rapid determinations of the presence of an analyte, may also be employed within the
scope of the present invention. The system requires high affinity between the antibody and the
analyte. According to one embodiment of the present invention, the presence of the amyloid
protein is determined using a pair of antibodies, each specific for amyloid protein. One of said
pairs of antibodies is referred to herein as a "detector antibody" and the other of said pair of
antibodies is referred to herein as a "capture antibody". The monoclonal antibody of the present
invention can be used as either a capture antibody or a detector antibody. The monoclonal
antibody of the present invention can also be used as both capture and detector antibody,
together in a single assay. One embodiment of the present invention thus uses the double
antibody sandwich method for detecting amyloid protein in a sample of biological fluid. In this
method, the analyte (amyloid protein) is sandwiched between the detector antibody and the
capture antibody, the capture antibody being irreversibly immobilized onto a solid support. The
detector antibody would contain a detectable label, in order to identify the presence of the
antibody-analyte sandwich and thus the presence of the analyte.

Exemplary solid phase substances include, but are not limited to, microtiter plates, test tubes of
polystyrene, magnetic, plastic or glass beads and slides which are well known in the field of
radioimmunoassay and enzyme immunoassay. Methods for coupling antibodies to solid phases
are also well known to those skilled in the art. More recently, a number of porous material such
as nylon, nitrocellulose, cellulose acetate, glass fibers and other porous polymers have been
employed as solid supports.
The present invention also relates to a diagnostic kit for detecting amyloid protein in a biological
sample comprising a composition as defined above. Moreover, the present invention relates to
the latter diagnostic kit which, in addition to a composition as defined above, also comprises a
detection reagent as defined above. The term "diagnostic kit" refers in general to any diagnostic
kit known in the art. More specifically, the latter term refers to a diagnostic kit as described in
Zrein et al. (1998).
It is still another object of the present invention to provide novel immunoprobes and test kits for
detection and diagnosis of amyloid-associated diseases and conditions comprising antibodies
according to the present invention. For immunoprobes, the antibodies are directly or indirectly
attached to a suitable reporter molecule, e.g., an enzyme or a radionuclide. The test kit includes a
container holding one or more antibodies according to the present invention and instructions for
using the antibodies for the purpose of binding to amyloid protein to form an immunological
complex and detecting the formation of the immunological complex such that presence or
absence of the immunological complex correlates with presence or absence of amyloid protein.

 EXAMPLES
Materials
 The development and preparation of mouse monoclonal antibody ACI-01-Ab7C2 (named
 "mC2'   and hC2 for the humanized C2 antibody, throughout the application) is described in co
 pending application EP 05 02 7092.5 filed 12.12.2005, the disclosure of which is incorporated
 herein by reference.
 Hybridoma cells FP-12H3-C2, producing mouse monoclonal antibody ACI-01-Ab7C2 (named
 "mC2" and hC2 for the humanized C2 antibody, throughout the application) were deposited 01
 December 2005 in co-pending application no EP05027092.5 with the "Deutsche Sammlung von
Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen GmbH (DSMZ) in Braunschweig, Mascheroder Weg 1 B,
 38124 Braunschweig, under the provisions of the Budapest Treaty and given accession no DSM
ACC2750.
 Hybridoma cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented
with 10% foetal bovine serum and antibiotics (Penicillin/Streptomycin).      The isotype of the
antibody produced was checked and found to be mouse IgG2b/kappa, as expected.
Assay
An ELISA for binding to Amyloid Beta provided a reliable measure of the potency of C2
antibodies.    Positive control antibodies, murine FP-12H3-C2 antibody (Genovac Lot No:
AK379/01), and standard Chemicon antibody 1560 (Lot no: 0508008791).
Choice of human constantregions
As immune system recruitment is not desirable for the clinical antibody candidate, the selected
human constant region for the heavy chain was human IgG4, modified to change Serine at
position 228 in the hinge region to Proline (HuIgG4 Ser-Pro).      This mutation stabilizes the
interchain disulphide bond and prevents the formation of half molecules that may occur in native
human IgG4 preparations. The antibody expressed from the production cell lines will also have
the terminal lysine removed.    The sequences of human constant regions HuIgG4 Ser-Pro and
human Kappa are given in SEQ ID NO: 17 and 14, respectively.

 Example 1      Cloning and Sequencing of Antibody Variable Regions
 Total RNA was prepared from 3 x 106 hybridoma cells (one T175 flask) using the Qiagen
 RNeasy mini kit (Cat No: 74104).      RNA was eluted in 50ptL water and checked on a 1.2%
 agarose gel. The conditioned medium from the cells was retained and a sample used for testing
 in the antibody activity assay.
VH    and VK cDNAs were prepared using reverse transcriptase with mouse IgG and          K constant
region primers.    The first strand cDNAs were amplified by PCR using a large set of signal
 sequence primers. The amplified DNAs were gel-purified and cloned into the vector pGem@ T
Easy (Promega). The VH and VK clones obtained were screened for inserts of the expected size
by PCR and the DNA sequence of selected clones determined by automated DNA sequencing.
The locations of the complementarity determining regions (CDRs) in the sequences were
determined with reference to other antibody sequences (Kabat EA et al., 1991). The numbering
convention of Kabat for antibody variable regions is used throughout this application; hence
residue numbers may differ from the strict linear number.
The DNA sequence and deduced amino acid sequence for mC2 VK is shown in SEQ ID NO: 29
and 27, respectively. Four clones gave this identical productive sequence. A non-productive
aberrant VK sequence that arises from the hybridoma fusion partner was also found in a number
of clones.
For mC2 VH, two different productive sequences were isolated. The mC2 VH AF sequence (see
SEQ ID NO: 30) was found in a total of 29 clones, with 14 single base pair changes in individual
clones. The mC2 VH B sequence was found in a total of 8 clones. Five of these represented the
majority sequence, with the other 3 clones being variations on this.      It is possible that these
similar VH B sequences arose as an artifact of the PCR amplification. A non-productive aberrant
VH   was also obtained from the C2 hybridoma and is attributed to defective V-D-J joining.
In order to determine which is the correct active mC2 VH, two chimeric antibodies were prepared
with the two different VH sequences, AF and B, combined with the mC2 VK, to be tested for the
correct antibody activity.

Example 2        Construction of Chimeric Antibody Genes
A human chimeric antibody in its most common form consists of human constant regions linked
to murine (or other non-human) variable regions. A chimeric antibody provides a very useful
tool, firstly for confirmation that the correct variable regions have been identified, secondly for
use as a control antibody in antigen binding assays with the same effector functions and utilizing
the same secondary detection reagents as a humanized or engineered antibody, and also may be
used to investigate the pharmacokinetic and other properties of the human constant regions with
reference to the particular target for the antibody.
Two chimeric heavy chain expression vectors were constructed consisting of mC2 VH AF or
mC2 VH B variable regions linked to HuIgG4 (Ser-Pro) constant region in the expression vector
pSVgpt.     This is based on pSV 2gpt (Mulligan and Berg, 1980) and includes the ampicillin

murine heavy chain immunoglobulin enhancer region, genomic sequence encoding the constant
region gene and SV40 poly A sequences.          The heavy chain variable region for expression is
inserted as a HindlIl to BamHI fragment.
A chimeric light chain vector was constructed consisting of C2 VK linked to human C Kappa
constant region in the expression vector pSVhyg. (Hieter PA et al, 1980) pSVhyg includes the
ampicillin resistance gene for selection in bacterial cells, the hyg gene for selection in
mammalian cells, the murine heavy chain immunoglobulin enhancer region, genomic sequence
encoding the kappa constant region gene and including the kappa enhancer and SV40 poly A
sequences.     The light chain variable region for expression is inserted as a HindlIl to BamHI
fragment.
Expression cassettes for the murine C2 VH and VK sequences were constructed by addition of
5'  flanking sequence including the leader signal peptide, leader intron and the murine
immunoglobulin promoter, and 3' flanking sequence including the splice site and intron
sequence, using the vectors VH-PCR1 and VK-PCRI as templates (Riechmann et al., 1988).
The DNA sequence was confirmed to be correct for the VH and VK in the chimeric expression

 cassettes are shown in Figures 1 and 2.
Example 3        Expression of Chimeric Antibodies
3.1 Expression in stable cell lines
The host cell line for antibody expression was NSO, a non-immunoglobulin producing mouse
myeloma, obtained from the European Collection of Animal Cell Cultures, Porton UK (ECACC No
 85110503). The heavy and light chain expression vectors were co-transfected into NSO cells by
electroporation. Colonies expressing the gpt gene were selected in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's
Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum (FBS), 0.8 tg/ml mycophenolic
acid and 250 pg/ml xanthine. Transfected cell clones were screened for production of human
antibody by ELISA for human IgG. Cell lines secreting antibody were expanded and the highest
producers selected and frozen down in liquid nitrogen. The best producing cell lines for each
antibody were expanded in medium as above but with only 5% FBS. Chimeric antibodies were
purified using Prosep@-A (Bioprocessing Ltd). The concentration was determined by ELISA for
human IgGK antibody. The antibodies were also analyzed by SDS-PAGE.
3.2 Transient expression of chimeric antibodies
To expedite the testing of the different chimeric antibodies, transient expression was used to
produce quickly small quantities of cell supernatant containing recombinant antibody for testing.
The mC2 VH and VK expression cassettes were transferred to vectors based on pcDNA3.1
(Invitrogen) for transient expression. The heavy chain vector included a human IgG constant
region. The light chain vector included a human kappa constant region. Both mC2 VH AF and
mC2 VH B were transfected with mC2 VK into human embryonic kidney (HEK 298) cells with
Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen Cat No: 11668) according to the protocol supplied by
the manufacturer. Conditioned medium was harvested from cells 3 days after transfection. The
amount of antibody produced was determined by ELISA for human IgGK antibody.

    WO 2008/011348                                                       PCT/US2007/073504
Example 4       Activity of Chimeric C2 Antibodies
4.1 Activity of chimeric C2 antibodies produced by transient transfection
Samples of conditioned medium from transient transfection for the two different chimeric
antibodies were tested in the ELISA for binding to Amyloid Beta. The results clearly indicate
that the C2 VH AF is the correct sequence. The C2 VH AF/C2 VK chimeric antibody binds well
in the assay, but the C2 VH B/C2 VK does not show any binding at all. The Chemicon 1560
murine control antibody showed good binding, but binding by the purified murine C2 antibody
supplied was low. It should be noted that a different secondary antibody was employed for the
murine antibodies with the mouse constant regions compared to the chimeric antibodies with
human constant regions, so the results are not directly comparable. Conditioned medium from
the C2 hybridoma was later found to give a good result in the assay.
4.2 Activity ofpurified chimeric C2 antibodies
The two different C2 chimeric antibodies were purified from stable NSO cell lines as described
and tested using the Amyloid Beta ELISA. The results obtained are in accordance with the
results obtained with transiently expressed antibody. The C2 ChVH AF/ChVK antibody binds
well in the ELISA and the C2 ChVH B/ChVK antibody does not bind at all.
Example 5       Design of Humanized C2 Antibody Genes
The mC2 VH and VK amino acid sequences were compared to rodent antibody VH and VK
sequences in the NCBI and Kabat databases.
5.1 Light chain variable region
The closest match mouse germ line gene to mC2 VK is bbl, Locus MMU231201, (Schable et al,
1999). Only two amino acids differ from this germ line sequence, both located within CDRL1.
Mature murine antibodies with similar, but not identical, sequence are found. Several have an
identical CDRL2 and identical CDRL3, but the CDRL1 of mC2 seems to be unique. mC2 VK
can be assigned to Kabat subgroup MuVKII. Position 87 of mC2 VK is F rather than the Y that is
more common in the subgroup, indicating that this framework residue may be important for
antibody activity.   Comparison with human germ line VK sequences shows that genes from
                                              88

     WO 2008/011348                                                       PCT/US2007/073504
 subgroup VKII are the best match for mC2 VK (Cox et al, 1994). Sequence DPK1 5 together with
 the human J region HuJK1 were selected to provide the acceptor framework sequences for the
 humanized VK.
 Four humanized VK sequences were designed.         C2HuVK1 consists of mC2 VK CDRs with
 frameworks from DPK 15 and human JK1. In versions 2, 3 and 4 murine residues have been
 substituted in the framework at positions 45 or 87 or both. Residue 45 may be involved in
 supporting the conformation of the CDRs. Residue 87 is located at the interface of the VH and
 VK  domains. Therefore these residues may be critical for maintenance of antibody binding.
The positions and changes that have been made in the light chain framework regions are shown
 in Table 6. A comparison of the humanized sequences with mC2 VK sequence, and with DPK1 5
 and human JK1
 5.2 Heavy chain variable region
The closest match mouse germ line gene to mC2 VH AF is VH7183, Locus AF120466, (Langdon
et al, 2000). The comparison is shown in Figure 3. Nine amino acids differ from this germ line
sequence, most being located within CDR2. Mature murine antibodies with identical or similar
(one residue different) CDR1 or with similar CDR2 (one residue different) are found, but none
with all three CDRs identical to mC2 VH AF.         CDR3 of mC2 antibody is unusually short,
consisting of only three residues.   However, other antibodies are found in the database with
CDR3 of this length. mC2 VH AF can be assigned to Kabat subgroup MuVHIIID. Residue 47 of
mC2 VH is L rather than the more common W, and residue 94 is S rather than the normal R,
indicating that these framework residues may be important for antibody activity. Comparison
with human germ line VH sequences shows that genes from subgroup VHIII are the best match
for mC2 VH. Sequence DP54 together with the human J region HuJH6 was selected to provide
the acceptor framework sequences for the humanized VH
Four humanized VH sequences were designed. C2HuVH1 consists of mC2 VH AF CDRs with
frameworks from DP54 and HuJH6. In versions 2, 3 and 4 murine residues have been substituted
in the framework at positions 47 or 94 or both. Residue 47 in framework 2 makes contact both
with the CDRs and with the VK domain.          Residue 94 may be involved in supporting the
conformation of the CDRs. Therefore these residues may be critical for maintenance of antibody
binding.

The positions and changes that have been made in the heavy chain framework regions are shown
in Table 7.
Example 6       Construction of Humanized Antibody Genes
The modified variable regions were constructed by the method of overlapping PCR
recombination. The expression cassettes for the chimeric antibody, C2 ChVH AF and C2 ChVK,
were used as templates for mutagenesis of the framework regions to the required sequences.
Sets of mutagenic primer pairs were synthesized encompassing the regions to be altered. The
humanized VH and VK expression cassettes produced were cloned into pUC19 and the entire
DNA sequence was confirmed to be correct for each VH and VK. The modified heavy and light
chain V-region genes were excised from pUC19 as HindIl to BamHI expression cassettes.
These were transferred to the expression vectors pSVgpt and pSVhyg which include human
IgG4 Ser-pro or   K constant regions respectively, as for the chimeric antibody vectors. The DNA
sequence was confirmed to be correct for the humanized VH and VK in the expression vectors.
Example 7       Expression of Humanized Antibodies
 7.1 Expression in stable cell lines
The humanized heavy and light chain expression vectors were co-transfected into NSO cells by
electroporation, as for the expression of chimeric antibodies. Antibody producing cell lines were
selected and expanded and humanized antibodies purified, exactly as for the chimeric antibody.
The purified antibodies were analyzed by SDS-PAGE.
 7.2 Transient expression of humanized antibodies
To expedite testing of the different humanized VH and VK constructs, the C2 humanized VH and
VK   expression cassettes were also transferred to the vectors for transient expression described in
section 7.2. The four humanized C2 VK constructs were co-transfected with the chimeric C2 VH
construct into HEK293 cells.        Similarly, the four humanized C2 VH constructs were co
transfected with the chimeric C2 VK construct into HEK293 cells. Conditioned medium was
                                                90

     WO 2008/011348                                                         PCT/US2007/073504
harvested from cells three days after transfection.       The amount of antibody produced was
determined by ELISA for human IgGK antibody.
Example 8        Activity of Humanized C2 Antibodies
8.1 Activity of humanized C2 antibodies produced by transient transfection
Samples of conditioned medium from the transient transfection were tested in the Amyloid Beta
ELISA. The results obtained clearly indicate that the humanized VH constructs C2 HuVH AF
versions 2 and 4 are functional when combined with the chimeric C2 kappa chain, and are
comparable to the chimeric C2 antibody in the assay. In contrast, the antibodies containing C2
HuVH AF versions 1 and 3 combined with the chimeric C2 kappa chain show no binding at all
in the assay. This indicates that the substitution of the murine residue at position 94 is essential
for antibody activity.    Antibodies containing the chimeric C2 heavy chain combined with the
four humanized C2 kappa chains all showed good binding, comparable to the chimeric antibody,
in the ELISA.
8.2 Activity of purified humanized C2 antibodies
Eight different humanized C2 antibodies comprising all combinations of two humanized heavy
chains and four humanized light chains were purified from stable NSO cell lines as described and
tested using the Amyloid Beta ELISA (Figure 4).
The results obtained clearly indicate that C2 HuVH4 antibodies perform better in the assay than
C2 HuVH2 antibodies.        Of the C2 HuVH2 antibodies, C2 HuVH2/HuVK3 shows the best
binding activity, but this is approximately 2 fold reduced compared to the chimeric control
antibody C2 ChVHAF/ChVK.            C2 HuVH2/HuVK2 activity is four to five fold reduced
compared to the control. The activities of the antibodies comprising C2HuVH4 with the four
different humanized light chains are similar.            The highest activity is observed for
C2HuVH4/HuVKl and all four antibodies are close to the control chimeric antibody in the assay.

Example 9       Modifications to CDRL2
9.1 Design light chain with modified CDR 2
As noted above, many antibodies share the same CDRL2 sequence ("KVSNRFS") as the C2
antibody. It was decided to test whether CDRL2 could be modified slightly without adversely
affecting antibody activity. Two conservative substitutions were selected: R for K at position 50
and S for N at position 53. The two alternative CDRL2 sequences are therefore "RVSNRFS"
and "KVSSRFS". These were incorporated into the murine VK sequence with no other changes,
as mC2 VK-R and mC2 VK-S respectively.
9.2 Transient expression of modified CDRL2 antibody
The two C2 light chain constructs with modified CDRL2 described in Section 11.2.1 were
cloned into the light chain vector for transient expression.   Each was co-transfected with the
chimeric C2 VH vector into HEK293 cells. Conditioned medium was harvested from cells three
days after transfection. The amount of antibody produced was determined by ELISA for human
IgGK antibody.
9.3 Activity of C2 antibody with modified CDRL2
Samples of conditioned medium from the transient transfection of mC2 VKs with modified
CDRL2 combined with mC2 VH were tested in the Amyloid Beta ELISA.(Figure 5) Both the
VK-R and the VK-S antibodies are comparable to the chimeric C2 antibody, indicating that the
individual modifications to CDRL2 chosen do not markedly affect the activity of the antibody in
the assay.
Example 10     Affinity Determination
To assess the binding specificity and affinity of mouse (ACI-01-Ab-7-C2) chimeric (AF) and
humanized antibodies (H4K1; H4K4), BIACORE.RTM. analysis was performed using amyloid
beta 1-42 monomers and fibers as antigen immobilized on a CM5 chip. BIACORE.RTM.
technology utilizes changes in the refractive index at the surface layer upon binding of the
antibody to the antigen immobilized on the layer. Binding is detected by surface plasmon
resonance (SPR) of laser light refracting from the surface. Analysis of the signal kinetics on rate

Example 11 Immunhistochemical Binding Assay
11.1    Human brain sections
Brains from healthy, non-demented pre-AD and AD patients were obtained from the
Universitatsklinik in Bonn after ethical approval. Brains were fixed in formaldehyde and the
hippocampus region was dehydrated, embedded in paraffin and 5 ym sections were cut with a
microtome. Paraffin sections were stored at RT until use. For fresh material, 5 tm cryosections
were cut with a cryostat and sections stored at -80'C until use.
11.2    Immunohistochemistry
Paraffin sections were deparaffinized and rehydrated by bathing slides in xylene followed by
 100% ethanol, 90% ethanol and 70% ethanol. Background was decreased by 30 minutes
incubation in 10%H 2 02 , 10% methanol in water. Antigen retrieval was obtained by incubating
the slides in 100% formic acid for 3 minutes. After 3 washes in Tris buffered saline (TBS, pH
7.5), non-specific labeling was blocked by a 2 hour incubation of the slides in 10 %BSA, 0.25%
Triton X-100 in TBS. After washing (3 washes in TBS) blocking of endogenous antibodies was
performed by adding a non-labeled anti-human IgG (Biomeda) and incubating slides in humid
chambers overnight at RT. After another 3 washes, the primary human anti amyloid antibody
was added to the slides and incubated another 24 hours at RT. Following washing, an alkaline
phosphatase labeled secondary anti human IgG (Sigma) was added to the slides and incubated
                                                93

 for 2 hours at RT. After washing, slides were developed with Liquid permanent Red
 (Dakocytomation) washed with water and air-dried before mounting with permanent mounting
media (corbitbalsam).
 Cryosection were fixed in methanol for 30 minutes at -80'C and background decreased by
 adding H2 02 to the cold methanol to a final concentration of 10% and incubating for 30 minutes
at RT. After 3 washes in Tris buffered saline (TBS, pH7.5), non-specific labeling was blocked by
a 2 hour incubation of the slides in 10 % BSA, 0.25% Triton X 100 in TBS as above and the
same staining procedure as above was carried out.
Sections were examined with a Leica DMLB microscope and photographed using a Leica
DC500 camera and Leica FireCam1.2.0 software.
Both human antibodies A and C labeled plaques of brains from AD disease patients (Figure 6).
Both diffuse and cored plaques were labeled. Moreover, diffuse plaques in non -demented pre
AD patients could also be detected by the A and C antibodies. Amyloid in cerebral amyloid
angiopathy (CAA) was labeled with both antibodies and some staining of neurons which may
correspond to intracellular amyloid was also detected. No labeling was seen on control brains
from healthy patient. Plaques could be detected on paraffin sections pretreated with formic acid
but no plaques were labeled on paraffin sections without formic acid pretreatment and on
cryosections fixed in methanol.     The human antibody B did not detect plaques on paraffin
sections and the mouse antibody did not stain either paraffin or cryosections of human brains.

 12.1    Modification of Conformation of Ad-42 Fibers and Initiation of Disaggregationafter
Binding of the mC2 antibody
In order to evaluate the mechanism by which the antibody is capable to disaggregate preformed
beta-amyloid (AO31 42 ) fibers a head-to-head comparison of Thioflavin-T (Th-T) fluorescent assay
was performed measuring disaggregation and solid-state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) of
U-13C Tyrosinel0 and Valinel2-labeled A1-42 peptide analysing secondary conformation
(Figure 7A). The mC2 antibody solubilised 35.4 % of the preformed A31-42 fibers and
simultaneously induced a shift in secondary conformation from beta sheet to random coiled. The
reduction in the population of the beta sheet conformation with respect to the random coil is of
the order of 35% and is therefore in close agreement with that measured using fluorescence Th-T
assay (Figure 7B). These data indicate that the binding of the mC2 antibody initiates a transition
of the secondary structure        which potentially causes       a destabilization of the parallel
intermolecular arrangement of the beta sheets affecting a break of elongated fibers into smaller
fragments.
12.2     Conformation-dependentBinding Affinity of mC2 antibody
Since it is well known in the scientific literature that a proportion of the antibody-antigen binding
energy can be used for energy-dependent modification of the conformation of an antigen (Blond
and Goldberg, 1987), a comparison experiment of the binding affinity of the C2 antibody to the
whole A0 1-42 protein and to a smaller, nine amino acid long, peptide comprising the antibody's
epitope was performed (Figure 8). For this comparison the affinities of the humanized antibody
C2 were analyzed by ELISA using biotinylated peptides covering the complete amino-acid
sequence of the C2's epitope (produced by Mimotopes and purchased from ANAWA Trading
SA) and a biotinylated complete A01 -42 peptide (Bachem). The analysis was done according to
the manufacturer's (Mimotopes) instructions. As demonstrated in Figure 8 andTable 2, the
antibody binds with a 36.0% higher affinity to the peptide comprising its specific epitope
(aminoacids 13-21 of the Aol- 42 sequence) than to the whole A01-42 protein. It is therefore
suggested that the difference in binding affinity energy was used for the energy-consuming
transition of the secondary conformation of the amyloid protein to present the antigen in a more
acceptable position for the antibody interaction. This explains why the affinity of the antibody is
lower for the native (the whole amyloid protein) than for the isolated subunit.

Example 13       Effects of the anti-amyloid hC2 on the aggregation of amyloid beta 1-42
peptide
To evaluate the ability of the humanized anti-human amyloid beta monoclonal antibody hC2 to
mediate anti-aggregating and disaggregating effects on amyloid beta (AO) a thioflavin T
spectrofluorescence assay was accomplished.
 13.1 Inhibition of Aggregation Assay
A1-42 lyophilized powder was reconstituted in hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) to 1 mM. The
peptide solution was sonicated for 15 min at room temperature, agitated overnight, and aliquots
made into non-siliconized microcentrifuge tubes. The HFIP was then evaporated under a stream
of argon. The resulting peptide film was vacuum dried for 10 min and stored at -80'C until used.
To assay for the antibody-mediated inhibition of A1-42 aggregation the hC2 antibody was pre
diluted in PBS and an assay solution containing the following components was made in a non
siliconized incubation tube: 3.3 or 0.33 pM pre-diluted antibody, 10 pM thioflavin T, 33 pM
A01 -42, and 8.2% DMSO. Therefore the final molar ratios of antibody to A01 -42 were 1:10 and
1:100. Appropriate control solutions were also prepared. The solutions were then incubated for
24 hrs at 37'C, and the spectrofluorescence (relative fluorescence units; RFU) read in six
replicates   in  black   384-well  plates  (Perkin-Elmer)  on  a   Perkin-Elmer    FluoroCount
spectrofluorometer.      The spectrofluorescence was then measured       and % disaggregation
calculated as described below.
13.2 Disaggregation Assay
To assay for antibody-mediated disaggregation of pre-aggregated A01 -42, a low-molecular
weight A0 1-42, prepared as described above, was made up as a 110 pM solution in 27% DMSO
and lx PBS. This solution was then allowed to aggregate at 37'C for 24 hrs after which the

following were added: 3.3 or 0.33 pM pre-diluted antibody, and 10 yM thioflavin T. This
resulted in a molar ratio of 1:10 and 1:100 antibody to A01 -42. This solution was then incubated
for additional 24 hrs at 370 C. The spectrofluorescence was then measured and % disaggregation
calculated as described below.
13.3 Calculation
Inhibition of aggregation or disaggregation is expressed as mean % inhibition or disaggregation,
respectively,  standard error of the mean (SEM) according to the following equation:
   % inhibition = (RFU of pos contr - RFU of neg control) - (RFU of sample with Ap1-42 - RFU of sample without AB1-42) x 100%
                                             (RFU of pos control - RFU of neg control)
13.4 Result
13.4.1 Inhibition ofAf1-42 aggregation
Inhibition of A13 -42 aggregation using the hC2 antibody is shown in Table 3 and Figure 11. At
an antibody to A1l-42 molar ratio of 1:100 the inhibition averaged 30% (2 independent
experiments), whereas at a 1:10 molar ratio the inhibition was 80% (2 independent experiments;
see Table 3).

Using the thioflavin T assay, the bi-functional properties of the anti-Af humanized antibody hC2
 can be demonstrated, namely to inhibit the aggregation of Al-42 into pathogenic protofibrillar
conformation and in addition to disaggregate preformed Af1-42 protofibrils.          hC2 inhibited
A01-42 aggregation by 80% at an antibody to Af1-42 molar ratio of 1:10. The ability of hC2 to
disaggregate pre-aggregated protofibrils of A01 -42 at a 1:10 molar ratio was shown to be 32%.
Example 14: Conformation-specific binding of mC2 to different classes of Amyloid Protein
In order to evaluate the specificity of mC2 to different stages of polymerized amyloid protein,
monomeric, polymeric soluble       and fibrillic amyloid, an ELISA coated with these different
stages of polymeric beta-amyloid was performed (Figure 9). Monomers were prepared according
to a modified method published by (Klein, 2002), soluble polymeric amyloid beta according to
(Barghorn et al., 2005), whereas fibers were performed by incubation of amyloid (Bachem,
Switzerland) with a final concentration of 1pLg/pl in Tris/HCl pH 7.4 at 370 C for 5 days followed
by a centrifugation step (10,000 rpm for 5 minutes). Then amyloid polymers were coated on an
ELISA plates with a final concentration of 55ptg/ml and binding affinity ELISA by using an anti
mouse IgG monoclonal antibody (Jackson) labelled with alkaline phosphate was performed. As
demonstrated in Table 5 the mC2 antibody binds with higher affinity to soluble polymeric
amyloid beta than to fibers and with the lowest to monomers. These data indicate that the
antibody's binding is influenced by the amyloid epitope and by the conformation of the different
amyloid aggregates.

Example 15: Epitope mapping of AC Immune's monoclonal antibody hC2
Epitope mapping of the humanized monoclonal antibody hC2 was performed by ELISA using
three different peptide libraries. One library comprised a total of 33 biotinylated peptides
covering the complete amino acid (aa) sequence of AP1-42 (produced by Mimotopes and
purchased from ANAWA Trading SA), the second library contains biotinylated peptides using
peptide 12 (aal2-20 of AO) from the first peptide library and substituting each aa in the sequence
by an alanine (see table 8 below) , and the third library contains biotinylated peptides 13, 14, or
 15 (aa 13-21, 14-22 or 15-23 of AO) and substituting in each case the last amino acids to an
alanine or to a glycine for aa 21 which is already an alanine (see table 9 below). A biotinylated
complete A1-42 peptide was used as positive control (Bachem). Epitope mapping was done
according to the manufacturer's (Mimotopes) instructions. Briefly, Streptavidin coated plates
(NUNC) were blocked with 0.1% BSA in PBS overnight at 4'C. After washing with PBS-0.05%
Tween 20, plates were coated for 1 hour at RT with the different peptides from the library,
diluted in 0.1% BSA, 0.1% Sodium Azide in PBS to a final concentration of 10 yM. After
washing, plates were incubated for 1 hour at RT with the hC2 antibody or a non Ap. binding
chimeric IgG4 antibody diluted to 200 ng/ml in 2% BSA, 0.1% Sodium Azide in PBS. Plates
were washed again and incubated with alkaline phosphatase conjugated goat anti human IgG for
lh at RT. After final washing, plates were incubated with phosphatase substrate (pNPP) and read
at 405 nm using an ELISA plate reader.
It was shown that the humanized monoclonal antibody hC2 bound specifically to peptides
12,13,14,15 and 16 of the first peptide library. These peptides comprise aa 12-20, 13-21, 14-22,
15-23 and 16-24 respectively of A 1-42, suggesting that the epitope lies in region 12-24 of AO.
A second library with alanine substitutions was used to determine the critical aa for binding to
A012-20 (VHHQKLVFF). The binding of the hC2 antibody is lost completely when amino acids
                                               99

     WO 2008/011348                                                         PCT/US2007/073504
 16, 17, 19 or 20 are substituted by an alanine, indicating that these aa are absolutely critical for
binding of the antibody to A0. The binding of the hC2 antibody is partially lost when aa 15 and
 18 are substituted.
The binding was also almost completely lost when aa 14 was substituted for an alanine,
indicating that aa 14 is also very important for binding.
Finally, a third library was used to determine whether aa 21, 22 or 23 are critical for binding to
the epitope. The binding of the antibody to aa 15-23 was reduced when aa 23 was substituted for
an alanine, indicating that aa 23 is also important for binding. The binding was partially lost
when aa 21 was substituted for a glycine and slightly lost when aa 22 was substituted for an
alanine.
Example 16: Neuroprotection by the hC2 Antibody
The ability of antibody hC2 to protect neurons from Abeta oligomer-induced degeneration was
assessed in an in vitro assay. Embryonic day 16.5-17.5 mouse cortical neurons were isolated,
dissociated, and cultured in vitro in N3-F12 media. The cells were grown for nine days in total,
and were fed on day 3 and on the day that Abeta oligomer, or Abeta oligomer plus anti-Abeta
antibody hC2 was added. At day five ("4 days Abeta") or day six ("3 days Abeta"), certain wells
of cells were treated with either 2 tM Abeta oligomer alone, or a combination of 2 tM Abeta
oligomer and 50 ptg/mL anti-Abeta antibody hC2.
The Abeta oligomer was prepared by dissolving Abeta 1-42 (rPeptide) in HFIP, from which
Abeta peptides were aliquoted into 10ptl aliquots at 1mg/ml and then evaporated in a fume hood
for 30 minutes and peptide films were stored at -80C until use. Upon use, the peptide film was
dissolved in 10pl of DMSO, then 78.6pl of HAMS F12, and the Abeta peptide solution was
incubated at 4C for 24-48 hours (25tM final concentration of Abeta).
For control cells, DMSO-F12 alone was added at the same volume as Abeta-DMSO at day 5,
and the cells were cultured for an additional 4 days without any additional treatment. On day 9,
neurons from all culture conditions were fixed and stained with Tuj1 (an anti-beta-tubulin
antibody), followed by staining with secondary antibodies labeled with FITC to visualize
microtubules, and thus neuronal processes in general. The results are shown in Figure 13.

Untreated mouse embryonic cortical neurons showed normal morphology after nine days of
culture (Figure 13, leftmost panel). Treatment of the cells with Abeta oligomer for three days
induced axon degeneration and caused a decrease in the total number of axons (Figure 13, lower
center panel), and this effect was even more pronounced at four days of treatment (Figure 13,
upper center panel). In contrast, the cells treated with the combination of Abeta oligomer and
anti-Abeta antibody hC2 looked similar to control cells (Figure 13, upper and lower right
panels).  These results indicate that anti-Abeta antibody hC2 was able to protect embryonic
mouse cortical neurons from Abeta oligomer-induced degeneration.
