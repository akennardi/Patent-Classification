ABSTRACT
A fishing lure for the controlled release of burley with a fore chamber into which water
enters the lure, leading to an aft chamber from which burley and water exit the lure.
The lure accepts a squeeze bottle for easy filling with burley. Optional weights vary the
buoyancy of the lure and an optional beak can be fitted to help the lure dive as it is
being reeled in.

                               Burley Dispensing Fishing Lure
FIELD OF THE INVENTION
[0001]      The present invention relates to fishing lures, in particular to a fishing lure
that dispense burly (also known as chum).
BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION
[0002]      To help attract fish, recreational fishermen often disperse burley (chum) in
the water where they are fishing. Whilst often successful at attracting fish, the burley is
often quickly dispersed, giving a limited window of opportunity to try and catch the fish
that have been attracted.
[0003]      Various burley dispensers have been developed to slowly release burley
over a period of time.     Such devices are usually suspended by their own line in the
water. Whilst the burley is dispensed slowly, it is also restricted to a small area
adjacent to the dispenser. With ocean currents at play it is often difficult for a
fisherman to cast his line into the area of water with the burley present.
[0004]      In order to both slow down and co-locate burley dispersion with the fishing
line, burley dispensing lures have been developed. Known designs comprise a single
chamber for holding the burley with a number of apertures for the ingress of water and
egress of water/burley mixture. Such a device is shown in US patent publication US
6,588,138 B1. Whilst offering some advantages, such devices are found wanting,
either dispensing burley too quickly or too slowly depending on the size of the
apertures.
[0005]      The object of this invention is to provide burley lure to alleviate the above
problem, or at least provide the public with a useful alternative.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
[0006]      In a first aspect the invention comprises fishing lure for the controlled
release of burley, comprising a fore chamber into which water enters the lure and aft
chamber from which burley and water exit the lure, wherein the fore chamber is in fluid
communication with the aft chamber.
[0007]      Preferably the fore chamber and aft chamber are separated by a baffle.

[0008]      In preference the lure further comprises a hole adapted to receive burley
from a squeeze bottle and a skirt to direct burley towards the aft chamber.
[0009]      The lure may further comprise apertures for receiving lead shot and a beak
to direct the lure downwards as the lure moves through a body of water.
[0010]      It should be noted that any one of the aspects mentioned above may include
any of the features of any of the other aspects mentioned above and may include any
of the features of any of the embodiments described below as appropriate.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
[0019]     The following detailed description of the invention refers to the
accompanying drawings. Wherever possible, the same reference numbers will be used
throughout the drawings and the following description to refer to the same and like
parts. Dimensions of certain parts shown in the drawings may have been modified
and/or exaggerated for the purposes of clarity or illustration.
[0020]     The present invention provides a burley dispensing fishing lure with
improved burley dispersing performance. Uniquely the lure comprises a fore chamber
into which water enters which is in fluid communication with an aft burley chamber from
which the burley is dispensed. Such an arrangement produces a controlled release of
burley that provides sufficient burley to attract fish, whilst not emptying too quickly to
require frequent refilling.

                                                -r
[0021]      A lure 10 according to the present invention is shown from a first side in
Figure 1 and a second side in Figure 2. These two views show the external features of
the lure and correspond to the left shell 20 and right shell 30 which join together to form
the lure. The shells are generally elongate in the form of a fish and holds eyelets 51,
52 and 53 to which gang hooks 61, 62 and 63 are attached. As the hooks are attached
via eyelets they can be readily changed to other styles or sizes of hooks. A further
eyelet 50 allows for attachment of the lure to a fishing line.
[0022]      The left shell 20 as seen in Figure 1 comprises holes 21 and slits 22 towards
the front that allow water to enter the lure and holes 24 towards the rear that allows
water to exit the lure carrying burley. A series of shots holders 23 allow the lure to be
weighted with lead shot to control buoyancy.
[0023]      Similarly, the right shell 30 as seen in Figure 2 comprises holes 31 and slits
32 towards the front that allow water to enter the lure and holes 34 towards the rear
that allows water to exit the lure carrying burley. A series of shots holders 33 allow the
lure to be weighted with lead shot to control buoyancy. Unique to the right shell is a
burley inlet hole 35 for filling the lure with burley.
[0024]      The internal features of the lure 10 can be appreciated from the exploded
view of Figure 3. The lure 10 is substantially hollow and divided into a fore chamber 41
and an aft chamber and aft chamber 42. The two chambers are in fluid communication
via baffle 37. Water can enter the fore chamber 41via holes 31 and slits 32 on the right
hand side and holes 21 and 22 on the left hand side. The aft chamber 42 holds the
burley in the form of a slurry and allows it to exit via holes 34 on the right hand side and
holes 24 on the left hand side. Burley is introduced into the aft chamber 42 via burley
inlet hole 35. The hole 35 is flanked by skirt 36 which directs the burley rearwards into
the chamber 42.
[0025]      The internal features can be further appreciated with the aid of Figure 4
which shows the mid section of the right shell 30 in close up. Of note, the baffle 37 has
a comparable structure in the left hand shell (not shown) and the skirt 36 protrudes
beyond the edges of the shell 30 into an opposing void formed by the left hand shell
20.
[0026]      Figure 5 demonstrates how the lure 10 is filled with burley. A burley mix is
conveniently stored in a plastic squeeze bottle 70 with a twist closure 71 as is

commonly used for condiments such as tomato sauce. The tip of the twist closure 71 is
placed into the burley inlet hole 35 and the bottle squeezed to transfer the burley into
the lure. Internally the burley will be directed by skirt 36 towards the aft chamber 42.
The squeeze bottle may be filled with a variety of different burley mixtures depending
on the type of fish and fishing style being undertaken, e.g. se fishing, lake fishing, river
fishing etcetera. Burley mixtures may be supplied ready made in squeeze bottles by
retailers such as bait shops, or made by anglers themselves who could re-use
commercially supplied squeeze bottles, purchase empty squeeze bottles in conjunction
with a lure or even re-purpose squeeze bottles from other products. An angler would
most likely carry several bottles with different burley mixtures in anticipation of the
different varieties of fish they may encounter.
[0027]      Figure 6 shows the right hand shell 30 fitted with an optional beak 39. The
beak is a hydrodynamic aid to make the lure dive as it is pulled through the water in
order to mimic the behaviour of some fish. A similar beak would also be fitted to the left
hand shell
[0028]      The reader will now appreciate the present invention which provides a burley
dispensing lure with much improved burley dispensing performance.
[0029]      Further advantages and improvements may very well be made to the present
invention without deviating from its scope. Although the invention has been shown and
described in what is conceived to be the most practical and preferred embodiment, it is
recognized that departures may be made therefrom within the scope of the invention,
which is not to be limited to the details disclosed herein but is to be accorded the full
scope of the claims so as to embrace any and all equivalent devices and apparatus.
Any discussion of the prior art throughout the specification should in no way be
considered as an admission that such prior art is widely known or forms part of the
common general knowledge in this field.
[0030]      In the present specification and claims (if any), the word "comprising" and its
derivatives including "comprises" and "comprise" include each of the stated integers
but does not exclude the inclusion of one or more further integers.
