                                    ABSTRACT
A method performed in a portable computing device for intelligently performing
audio playback, upon connecting with an audio output system. The portable
computing device detects that a connection is made with an audio output system.
The portable computing device determines a first audio playback application that
last played audio and when the first audio playback application last played
audio. If the first audio playback application played audio within a specified
amount of time in the past, then the portable computing device signals that audio
playback be performed from the first audio playback application (through the
connection made with the audio output system.) If the first audio playback
application did not play audio within the specified amount of time in the past,
then the portable computing device determines a second audio playback
application that last played audio when the portable computing device was
previously connected to the audio output system and signals audio playback
from the second audio playback application (through the connection made with
the audio output system.) Other embodiments are also described and claimed.

                                         FIELD
[0002]     An embodiment of the invention is related to intelligently deciding
audio playback when a portable computing device such as a smart p connects to
an audio output system such as an automobile radio head unit. Other
embodiments are also described and claimed.
                                   BACKGROUND
[0003]     Modern automotive head units can connect with a portable computing
device (e.g., a smartphone) through either a wired connection (e.g., a universal
serial bus, USB, cable) or through a wireless connection (e.g., a Bluetooth
connection) to play audio content from an application running on the portable
computing device, which is converted to sound through the vehicle's speaker
system. Such playback of audio content can be halted and then resumed, by the
user manually selecting a pause or stop button and then a play button. The
playback can also be halted automatically when the portable computing device is
disconnected from the head unit. A process running in the portable computing
device monitors the "last playing audio application", by updating a data
structure that identifies the application that is in foreground and currently
playing audio. Examples include a music player application, a podcast
application, and a music streaming application.
                                            1

1002191195
[0004]     When the portable computing device connects to the head unit, the head
unit may send a command to the portable computing device to start playing
audio. In many cases, the portable computing device responds by playing audio
from the application that is currently running in the foreground. Some head
units will request a list of songs stored in a music library of the portable
computing device and then send a command to the portable computing device to
play the first song in the list (e.g., first song alphabetically). In both of these
cases, the decision of which application to play audio from is determined
simplistically, and more often than not, the decision does not meet the desires of
the user. Other head units do not automatically request audio playback to begin,
when the portable computing device connects to the head unit, but instead wait
for the user to manually choose what application to play audio from, which may
inconvenience the user.

                                DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0010]     Several embodiments of the invention with reference to the appended
drawings are now explained. Whenever aspects of the embodiments described
here are not explicitly defined, the scope of the invention is not limited only to
the parts shown, which are meant merely for the purpose of illustration. Also,
while numerous details are set forth, it is understood that some embodiments of
the invention may be practiced without these details. In other instances, well
known circuits, structures, and techniques have not been shown in detail so as
not to obscure the understanding of this description.
[0011]     Fig. 1 is a flow diagram illustrating a process for intelligently signaling
audio playback, according to some embodiments. The operations of the flow
diagram may be performed by a portable computing device (e.g., a smartphone
or a portable music player). In one embodiment, the process is initiated when the
portable computing device detects that a connection is made with an audio
output system (block 110). The audio output system may be a head unit of a
vehicle (that is coupled to one or more speakers in the vehicle), a speaker dock, or
any system that is capable of converting into sound the audio content that is
being played from the portable computing device. In one embodiment, the
connection between the portable computing device and the audio output system
is a wired connection made over a Universal Serial Bus (USB) cable. In other
embodiments, the connection is a wireless connection such as a Bluetooth
connection or a Wi-Fi connection.
[0012]     Upon detecting that a connection is made with the audio output system,
the portable computing device determines which audio playback application last
played audio in the portable computing device (, most recently played audio)
                                              3

1002191195
(block 120). An audio playback application, as used herein, is an application that
is capable of producing digital audio (e.g., from a music file, or other audio
program file) and allows a user to control the production of the digital audio by
halting and resuming the production of the digital audio. Examples of audio
playback applications include music player applications that play music content
stored locally in the portable computing device, music streaming applications
that stream music received from a music provider (e.g., over a data network such
as the Internet), and video playback applications. In some instances, a web
browser may also be an audio playback application (e.g., when it is used to play
audio or video).
[0013]     In one embodiment, the portable computing device executes an audio
playback controller program that manages audio playback for the portable
computing device. In one embodiment, the audio playback controller keeps track
of 1) which audio playback application last played audio (through a built-in
sound conversion subsystem of the portable computing device, or through an
external sound conversion subsystem such as a wired/wireless connected
headset, speaker dock, or vehicle head unit, just name a few examples) and 2)
when it last played audio. Other programs executing on the portable computing
device may access this stored information from the audio playback controller
program, to determine which audio playback application last played audio.
[0014]     The portable computing device determines whether the audio playback
application that last played audio in the portable computing device did so within
a specified amount of time in the past (block 130). This is to find out whether a
user was "recently" listening to audio from the audio playback application. For
example, the portable computing device could determine whether the audio
playback application that last played did so within the last eight minutes. The
eight minute value is provided by way of example and not limitation, and as
such this time interval can be configured as desired. As introduced above, the
audio playback controller may keep track of when the audio playback
                                          4

1002191195
application that last played audio did so, for example by associating a stored time
stamp with a stored identifier for the application. The time stamp could indicate
the time at which the audio playback was halted for any reason. The portable
computing device may access this stored information from the audio playback
controller to determine whether or not the audio playback application that last
played audio did so within a specified amount of time in the past.
[0015]     If the audio playback application that last played audio did so within the
specified amount of time in the past (e.g., within the last eight minutes), then this
indicates that the user was most likely recently listening to that audio playback
application. Thus, it is likely that the user would want to continue listening to
that audio playback application now (upon connecting with the audio output
device/system). As such, a process running in the portable computing device
signals that audio playback should begin from the audio playback application
that last played audio. This audio playback will be through the recently made
connection with the audio output system (block 140).
[0016]     Note that the application which is signaled to begin audio playback may
be, at that point, already in foreground (in which case the ongoing audio
playback is routed to the current connection with the audio output system), or it
may be in background (in which case it will be moved to foreground to play
audio out through the connection), or it may be closed (in which case it will be
launched so that is can play audio through the connection.)
[0017]     For example, consider a user that listens to a podcast on a headset
connected to his or her smartphone while walking to his or her vehicle. As the
user approaches the vehicle, the user disconnects the headset which stops the
playback (and pauses the podcast), and within a few minutes after having settled
inside the vehicle connects the smartphone to the head unit of the vehicle. In this
case, it is likely that the user would want to continue listening to the podcast.
The embodiment described here would automatically resume playback of the
                                            5

1002191195
paused podcast (through the vehicle speaker system) when the user connects the
smartphone to the head unit of the vehicle.
[0018]     On the other hand, if the audio playback application that last played
audio did not do so within the specified amount of time in the past (e.g., within
the last eight minutes), then this indicates that the user was not recently listening
to that audio playback application. Thus, it is likely that the user would want to
continue listening to whichever audio playback application the user was listening
to the last time the portable computing device of the user was connected to the
(now connected) audio output system. That information, namely the identity of
the application that was playing the last time the portable computing device was
connected to the audio output system, may have been monitored by the audio
playback controller program (e.g., previously stored, for access by other
programs in the portable computing device). As such, a process running in the
portable computing device signals that audio playback should begin from the
audio playback application that last played audio when the portable computing
device was previously connected to the audio output system. This audio
playback will be through the recently made connection with the audio output
system (block 150). For example, consider a user that listens to a podcast on a
smartphone (from a podcast application on the smartphone) while driving to
work (by connecting to a head unit of the vehicle). Once arrived at the office, the
user disconnects the smartphone from the vehicle (which pauses the podcast)
and begins working at her desk. A few hours later during lunchtime, for
example, the user listens to music (from a music playback application on the
smartphone that is different from the podcast application), but otherwise does
not listen to any other audio playback applications on the smartphone. When the
user returns to the vehicle late in the afternoon for the ride home, and connects
the smartphone to the head unit of the vehicle, it is likely that the user would
want to continue listening to the podcast application, and not the lunchtime
music (from the music playback application.) The embodiment described here
                                            6

1002191195
would automatically resume playback from the podcast application, when the
user connects the smartphone to the head unit of the vehicle.
[0019]     The decision of which audio playback application to play when a
portable computing device connects to an audio output system described above
is a heuristic, and thus the process may make a decision that does not match the
desires of the user.    As such, in another embodiment, the portable computing
device may provide a user interface for the user that allows the user to choose to
change the audio playback decision, to a different audio playback application
than the one initially chosen by the heuristic. The user interface thus provides a
"second option" that the user can choose, just in case the primary or first option
chosen by the heuristic is not what the user desired. Fig. 1 is used to illustrate
this "another choice" embodiment.
[0020]     For example, referring to Fig. 1, if the process running in the portable
computing device has decided upon the primary option being to begin the audio
playback from the audio playback application that last played audio (e.g., as in
block 140), then the portable computing device may provide a user interface for
the user to change the audio playback decision, to the application that last played
audio when the portable computing device was previously connected to the
audio output system (block 160). In other words, while playback is initially and
(automatically) decided as per block 140, the user is then prompted in block 160
to change the playback to a second option.
[0021]     Similarly, in another example of the second option depicted in Fig. 1, if
the process running in the portable computing device initially decided that audio
playback should be from the audio playback application that last played audio
when the portable computing device was previously connected to the audio
output system (e.g., as in block 150), then the portable computing device may
provide a user interface for the user to change the audio playback decision to the
second option, where the second option in this case is playback from the audio
playback application that last played audio (block 170).
                                             7

1002191195
[0022]     More generally, in one embodiment, the second options mentioned
above may be different than the ones given in blocks 160, 170 of Fig. 1, and may
be determined by a prediction model such as the prediction model described
below with reference to Fig. 2. In this way, the user interface provides the user
with an option to change the audio playback decision (initially made by the
heuristic) and instead begin playback from a different audio playback application
than the one chosen by the heuristic.
[0023]     In one embodiment, the portable computing device may provide the
user interface on a display of the audio output system. For example, in one
embodiment, the user interface is provided as a prompt/virtual button displayed
on a display of a vehicle head unit. The user may tap the virtual button on the
display (if the display is a touchscreen display) or actuate a physical button of the
head unit to begin audio playback from the second option instead of the primary
option. In another embodiment, the user interface is provided as a
prompt/virtual button displayed on a touchscreen display that is built into the
portable computing device. The user may tap the virtual button on the
touchscreen display or actuate a physical button of the portable computing
device to resume audio playback from the second option instead of the primary
option. In one embodiment, the user interface is provided as a voice command
interface. For example, a voice command application may prompt the user
whether the user wants to begin audio playback from the second option instead
of the primary option. The user may respond to the voice command application
by speaking a command to the voice command application (e.g., "yes" or "no").
[0024]     Fig. 2 is a flow diagram illustrating another process for intelligently
beginning audio playback, according to some embodiments. The operations of
the flow diagram may be performed by a portable computing device (e.g., a
smartphone or a portable music player). In one embodiment, the process is
initiated when the portable computing device detects that a connection is made
with an audio output system (block 210). The audio output system may be a
                                             8

1002191195
head unit of a vehicle (coupled to one or more speakers in a vehicle), a speaker
dock, or any system that is capable of converting audio content being played
from and received from the portable computing device. The connection between
the portable computing device and the audio output system may be wired or
wireless (as above, in the embodiments described in connection with Fig. 1).
[0025]     Upon detecting that a connection is made, the portable computing
device retrieves contextual information (block 220). In one embodiment, the
contextual information may relate to the surrounding situation of the portable
computing device (or its user context). For example, contextual information may
relate to the time of day, the date, the day of the week, current location, and/or
the current weather. In one embodiment, contextual information may also
include information relating to the current audio output system that the portable
computing device is connected with. The contextual information may be
obtained from one or more components of the portable computing device. For
example, contextual information may be obtained from any combination of
hardware devices and/or software code that operate as an internal digital clock, a
Global Positioning System (GPS) device, or a calendar. In one embodiment,
contextual information may be obtained by accessing information over a data
network (e.g., the Internet). In another embodiment, the contextual information
may include the current user context, e.g., walking, running, driving, and
exercising.
[0026]     The portable computing device identifies, using a prediction model, an
audio playback application that has the highest probability of being accessed by a
user, based on the contextual information (block 230). The prediction model may
learn the audio playback preferences and behavior patterns of the user, for
example, by keeping a record of how often, and under what circumstances, a
user plays audio from a given audio playback application. Thus, the prediction
model may be based on historical interactions of the user with the portable
computing device. The prediction model may utilize the contextual information,
                                           9

1002191195
along with learned audio playback preferences and behavior patterns of the user,
to predict the likelihood that a given audio playback application will be accessed
by the user (upon connecting with a particular audio output system), under
current circumstances. The prediction model can be based on any suitable
predictive modelling technique and/or machine learning technique. Examples of
such techniques are given in Appendix A titled "Application Recommendation
Based on Detected Triggering Events").
[0027]     For example, the predictive model may have learned from past behavior
of the user that the user almost always (e.g., nine times out of ten) plays a news
podcast from a podcast application on his or her morning commute to work. As
such, when the user connects his or her portable computing device to the head
unit of the vehicle in the morning, the predictive model may determine that the
podcast application has the highest probability (amongst the audio playback
applications stored in the portable computing device) of being accessed by the
user.
[0028]     The portable computing device begins audio playback from the audio
playback application that has the highest probability of being accessed by the
user. This audio playback will be through the recently made connection with the
audio output system (block 240). Thus, the portable computing device
intelligently makes a decision of which audio playback application to play based
on contextual information and the learned preferences and/or behavior patterns
of the user.
[0029]     The decision of which audio playback application to play when a
portable computing device connects to an audio output system described above
is a prediction that may make a decision that does not match the desires of the
user. As such, in one embodiment, the portable computing device may provide a
user interface for the user that allows the user to choose to change the audio
playback decision, to a different audio playback application than the one initially
chosen by the prediction model. The user interface thus provides a "second
                                          10

1002191195
option" that the user can choose, just in case the primary or first option chosen by
the prediction model is not what the user desired.
[0030]     For example, in one embodiment, the portable computing device
determines the second option by identifying, using the prediction model, an
audio playback application that has the second highest probability of being
accessed by the user based on the contextual information (block 250). The
portable computing device then provides a user interface for the user to indicate
that audio playback should be from the audio playback application that has the
second highest probability of being accessed by the user (block 260). In one
embodiment, the second option is determined by a heuristic such as the heuristic
described above with reference to Fig. 1. In this way, the user interface provides
the user with an option to start audio playback from a different audio playback
application than the one chosen by the heuristic. In one embodiment, the user
interface may provide more than one option for the user to select from. Similar
to the user interface discussed above with reference to Fig. 1, the portable
computing device may provide the user interface on a display of the audio
output system (e.g., display of a vehicle head unit) or a touchscreen display that
is built into the portable computing device. Also, the user interface may be
provided as a voice command interface.
[0031]     Any combination of the heuristic and the predictive model can be used
to intelligently and automatically (e.g., without needing a play command from
the user) start audio playback when a portable computing device connects to an
audio output system. For example, if the predictive model identifies an audio
playback application that has a high probability of being accessed by the user
(e.g., greater than 90 percent), the portable computing device may decide to start
audio playback from this audio playback application and not rely on the
heuristic. If the predictive model is not able to identify an audio playback
application that has a high enough probability of being accessed by the user, the
portable computing device may decide to rely on the heuristic to decide which
                                           11

1002191195
audio playback application to invoke. In one embodiment, the portable
computing device may override a command, received from the connected audio
output system, that is requesting to play audio from a particular audio playback
application, and instead play audio from an audio playback application that was
chosen based on a heuristic or a predictive model, as described above. These
processes, running in the portable computing device, may provide more
intelligent decisions than the audio output system, since they can take into
account the context of the portable computing device, e.g., its user context.
[0032]     In one embodiment, the portable computing device may also determine
the content to be played by the user via the audio output system. Once the audio
playback application is determined (e.g., blocks 140, 150, 230), the operating
system of the portable computing device may determine the recommended
content to be played during playback (e.g., blocks 140, 150 and 240). The
operating system may also generate a playback queue of recommended content
for the audio playback application that was determined (e.g., blocks 140, 150,
230). The operating system may also generate the playback queue of
recommended content for the audio playback application that is presented as an
alternative to the user (e.g., blocks 160, 170, 260). For example, at blocks 160, 170,
260, when the user is presented with a user interface that indicate that the audio
playback should be from a different audio playback application from the audio
playback application from which the audio playback has begun (blocks 140, 150,
and 240), the operating system may provide a playback queue of recommended
content and display the recommended content from the playback queue on the
user interface.
[0033]     The content may be, for example, a song, an album, an artist, an episode
of a podcast, etc. The operating system of the portable computing device may
determine the content to be played and build a playback queue of content (e.g., a
song queue, a playlist, etc.). When an audio playback application plays back
content, the audio playback application transmits a dictionary that includes a key
                                            12

1002191195
and values that identifies and describes the content being played to the operating
system. The operating system dynamically updates the dictionary during
playback. The key is a high level metadata that identifies the content (e.g., the
artist's name), and the values may specifically describe the content (e.g., the title
of the song, the album, the duration of the song, etc.). The operating system may
store the dictionary in a memory location in the portable computing device that is
accessible to the other parts of the portable computing device. For example,
other programs executing on the portable computing device (e.g., an audio
playback application) may access the memory location to obtain the key and
values and provides this information (e.g., title of the song currently playing and
the artist) to be displayed on the user interface (e.g., touch screen) to the user.
This audio playback application may also transmit to the operating system a
content tree. The root of the content tree may be the collection or lists of artists,
the collection of albums, the collection of songs, the collection of playlists, etc. If
the root is the collection of playlists (e.g., "all playlists"), the next level in content
tree includes a listing of all of the playlists (e.g., "on-the-go", "workout mix",
"studying music", etc.). The next level in the content tree from a selected playlist
(e.g., "workout mix") may include a list of all of the songs in this playlist.
[0034]     In one embodiment, using the dictionary and the content tree from the
audio playback applications, the operating system may include an analytical
engine that compiles a history of the content being played back by the user as
well as the frequency of playback of the content (e.g., a play count of a song,
album, artist, podcast etc.). The history of the content may also compile a time or
day that the user plays back a given content (e.g., workout songs in the morning).
The analytical engine may use the history of the content being played back and
the frequency of playback to determine the recommended content and to
generate a playback queue of recommended content. The recommendation of
content to be played or the playback queue of recommended content may also be
                                             13

1002191195
displayed to the user via the user interface to allow the user to select a content to
be played.
[0035]     In another embodiment, the analytical engine may also use the
contextual information to determine the recommended content and to generate a
playback queue of recommended content. For example, the analytical engine
may determine from the contextual information that the user is running, the user
is at the gym, and the time of day indicates that it is in the morning. Using this
contextual information, the analytical engine determines that the user's most
frequently played song from his "workout mix" playlist is the recommended

[0038]     Wireless circuitry 308 is used to send and receive information over a
wireless link or network to one or more other devices' conventional circuitry such
as an antenna system, an RF transceiver, one or more amplifiers, a tuner, one or
more oscillators, a digital signal processor, a CODEC chipset, memory, etc.
Wireless circuitry 308 can use various protocols, e.g., as described herein.
[0039]     Wireless circuitry 308 is coupled to processing system 304 via
peripherals interface 316. Interface 316 can include conventional components for
establishing and maintaining communication between peripherals and
processing system 304. Voice and data information received by wireless circuitry
308 (e.g., in speech recognition or voice command applications) is sent to one or
more processors 318 via peripherals interface 316. One or more processors 318
are configurable to process various data formats for one or more application
programs 334 stored on medium 302.
[0040]     Peripherals interface 316 couple the input and output peripherals of the
device to processor 318 and computer-readable medium 302. One or more
processors 318 communicate with computer-readable medium 302 via a
controller 320. Computer-readable medium 302 can be any device or medium
that can store code and/or data for use by one or more processors 318. Medium
302 can include a memory hierarchy, including cache, main memory and
secondary memory.
[0041]     Device 300 also includes a power system 342 for powering the various
hardware components. Power system 342 can include a power management
system, one or more power sources (e.g., battery, alternating current (AC)), a
recharging system, a power failure detection circuit, a power converter or
inverter, a power status indicator (e.g., a light emitting diode (LED)) and any
other components typically associated with the generation, management and
distribution of power in mobile devices.
[0042]     In some embodiments, device 300 includes a camera 344. In some
embodiments, device 300 includes sensors 346. Sensors can include
                                            15

1002191195
accelerometers, compass, gyrometer, pressure sensors, audio sensors, light
sensors, barometers, and the like. Sensors 346 can be used to sense location
aspects, such as auditory or light signatures of a location.
[0043]     In some embodiments, device 300 can include a GPS receiver, sometimes
referred to as a GPS unit 348. A mobile device can use a satellite navigation
system, such as the Global Positioning System (GPS), to obtain position
information, timing information, altitude, or other navigation information.
During operation, the GPS unit can receive signals from GPS satellites orbiting
the Earth. The GPS unit analyzes the signals to make a transit time and distance
estimation. The GPS unit can determine the current position (current location) of
the mobile device. Based on these estimations, the mobile device can determine a
location fix, altitude, and/or current speed. A location fix can be geographical
coordinates such as latitudinal and longitudinal information.
[0044]     One or more processors 318 run various software components stored in
medium 302 to perform various functions for device 300. In some embodiments,
the software components include an operating system 322, a communication
module (or set of instructions) 324, a location module (or set of instructions) 326,
an audio playback application selection module 328, and other applications (or
set of instructions) 334, such as a car locator app and a navigation app.
[0045]     Operating system 322 can be any suitable operating system, including
iOS, Mac OS, Darwin, RTXC, LINUX, UNIX, OS X, WINDOWS, or an embedded
operating system such as VxWorks. The operating system can include various
procedures, sets of instructions, software components and/or drivers for
controlling and managing general system tasks (e.g., memory management,
storage device control, power management, etc.) and facilitates communication
between various hardware and software components.
[0046]       Communication module 324 facilitates communication with other
devices over one or more external ports 336 or via wireless circuitry 308 and
includes various software components for handling data received from wireless
                                           16

1002191195
circuitry 308 and/or external port 336. External port 336 (e.g., USB, FireWire,
Lightning connector, 60-pin connector, etc.) is adapted for coupling directly to
other devices or indirectly over a network (e.g., the Internet, wireless LAN, etc.).
[0047]     Location/motion module 326 can assist in determining the current
position (e.g., coordinates or other geographic location identifier) and motion of
device 300. Modern positioning systems include satellite based positioning
systems, such as Global Positioning System (GPS), cellular network positioning
based on "cell IDs," and Wi-Fi positioning technology based on a Wi-Fi
networks. GPS also relies on the visibility of multiple satellites to determine a
position estimate, which may not be visible (or have weak signals) indoors or in
"urban canyons." In some embodiments, location/motion module 326 receives
data from GPS unit 348 and analyzes the signals to determine the current
position of the mobile device. In some embodiments, location/motion module
72326 can determine a current location using Wi-Fi or cellular location
technology. For example, the location of the mobile device can be estimated
using knowledge of nearby cell sites and/or Wi-Fi access points with knowledge
also of their locations. Information identifying the Wi-Fi or cellular transmitter is
received at wireless circuitry 308 and is passed to location/motion module 326. In
some embodiments, the location module receives the one or more transmitter
IDs. In some embodiments, a sequence of transmitter IDs can be compared with
a reference database (e.g., Cell ID database, Wi-Fi reference database) that maps
or correlates the transmitter IDs to position coordinates of corresponding
transmitters, and computes estimated position coordinates for device 300 based
on the position coordinates of the corresponding transmitters. Regardless of the
specific location technology used, location/motion module 326 receives
information from which a location fix can be derived, interprets that information,
and returns location information, such as geographic coordinates,
latitude/longitude, or other location fix data.

[0048]     An audio playback application selection module 328 can perform any
of the operations or processes discussed above for one or more of the
embodiments, to intelligently signal the start of audio playback when the device
300 connects to an audio output system (not shown).
[0049]     The one or more applications 334 on the mobile device can include any
applications installed on the device 300, including without limitation, a browser,
address book, contact list, email, instant messaging, word processing, keyboard
emulation, widgets, JAVA-enabled applications, encryption, digital rights
management, voice recognition, voice replication, a music player (which plays
back recorded music stored in one or more files, such as MP3 or AAC files), etc.
[0050]     There may be other modules or sets of instructions (not shown), such
as a graphics module, a time module, etc. For example, the graphics module can
include various conventional software components for rendering, animating and
displaying graphical objects (including without limitation text, web pages, icons,
digital images, animations and the like) on a display surface. In another example,
a timer module can be a software timer. The timer module can also be
implemented in hardware. The time module can maintain various timers for any
number of events.
[0051]     The I/O subsystem 306 can be coupled to a display system (not shown),
which can be a touch-sensitive (i.e., touchscreen) display. The display displays
visual output to the user in a GUI. The visual output can include text, graphics,
video, and any combination thereof. Some or all of the visual output can
correspond to user-interface objects. A display can use LED (light emitting
diode), LCD (liquid crystal display) technology, or LPD (light emitting polymer
display) technology, although other display technologies can be used in other
embodiments.
[0052]     In some embodiments, I/O subsystem 306 can include a display and
user input devices such as a keyboard, mouse, and/or track pad. In some
embodiments, I/O subsystem 306 can include a touch-sensitive display. A touch
                                          18

1002191195
sensitive display can also accept input from the user based on haptic and/or
tactile contact. In some embodiments, a touch-sensitive display forms a touch
sensitive surface that accepts user input. The touch-sensitive display/surface
(along with any associated modules and/or sets of instructions in medium 302)
detects contact (and any movement or release of the contact) on the touch
sensitive display and converts the detected contact into interaction with user
interface objects, such as one or more soft keys, that are displayed on the touch
screen when the contact occurs. In some embodiments, a point of contact
between the touch-sensitive display and the user corresponds to one or more
digits of the user. The user can make contact with the touch-sensitive display
using any suitable object or appendage, such as a stylus, pen, finger, and so forth.
A touch-sensitive display surface can detect contact and any movement or release
thereof using any suitable touch sensitivity technologies, including capacitive,
resistive, infrared, and surface acoustic wave technologies, as well as other
proximity sensor arrays or other elements for determining one or more points of
contact with the touch-sensitive display.
[0053]      Further, the I/O subsystem can be coupled to one or more other
physical control devices (not shown), such as pushbuttons, keys, switches, rocker
buttons, dials, slider switches, sticks, LEDs, etc., for controlling or performing
various functions, such as power control, speaker volume control, ring tone
loudness, keyboard input, scrolling, hold, menu, screen lock, clearing and ending
communications and the like. In some embodiments, in addition to the touch
screen, device 300 can include a touchpad (not shown) for activating or
deactivating particular functions. In some embodiments, the touchpad is a
touch-sensitive area of the device that, unlike the touch screen, does not display
visual output. The touchpad can be a touch-sensitive surface that is separate
from the touch-sensitive display or an extension of the touch-sensitive surface
formed by the touch-sensitive display.

configured component might or might not be reconfigurable for a different
operation. For example, a programmable processor can be configured by
providing suitable executable code; a dedicated logic circuit can be configured by
suitably connecting logic gates and other circuit elements; and so on.
[0055]     Any of the software components or functions described in this
application may be implemented as software code to be executed by a processor,
where the software code may be in any suitable computer language such as, for
example, Java, C, C++, C#, Objective-C, Swift, or scripting language such as Perl
or Python using, for example, conventional or object-oriented techniques. The
software code may be stored as a series of instructions or commands on a
computer readable medium for storage and/or transmission. A suitable non
transitory computer readable medium can include random access memory
(RAM), a read only memory (ROM), a magnetic medium such as a hard-drive or
a floppy disk, or an optical medium such as a compact disk (CD) or DVD (digital
versatile disk), flash memory, and the like. The computer readable medium may
be any combination of such storage or transmission devices.
[0056]     An embodiment may be an article of manufacture in which a machine
readable storage medium has stored thereon instructions that program one or
more data processing components (generically referred to here as a "processor")
to perform the operations described above. Examples of machine-readable
storage mediums include read-only memory, random-access memory, CD
ROMs, DVDs, magnetic tape, optical data storage devices, and carrier waves.

The machine-readable storage medium can also be distributed over a network so
that software instructions are stored and executed in a distributed fashion. In
other embodiments, some of these operations might be performed by specific
hardware components that contain hardwired logic. Those operations might
alternatively be performed by any combination of programmed data processing
components and fixed hardwired circuit components.
[0057]      Fig. 4 illustrates the available audio playbacks to a connection that is
