20 Field of Invention
    The present disclosure relates to fiber optic enclosure, and more particularly, to a fiber
    optic enclosure with cable payout.
25 Background of Invention
   As demand for telecommunications increases, fiber optic networks are being extended in
    more and more areas. In facilities                          such as multiple dwelling units, apartments,
    condominiums, businesses, etc., fiber optic enclosures are used to provide a subscriber
30  access point to the fiber optic network. These fiber optic enclosures are connected to the
    fiber optic network through subscriber cables connected to a network hub. However, the
    length of subscriber cable needed between the fiber optic enclosure and the network hub
    varies depending upon the location of the fiber optic enclosure with respect to the network

   Detailed Description of Preferred Embodiments of the Invention
 5 Reference will now be made in detail to the exemplary aspects of the present disclosure
   that are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Wherever possible, the same reference
   numbers will be used throughout the drawings to refer to the same or like structure.
   Referring now to FIG. 1 , a schematic representation of a fiber optic network, generally
10  designated 11, in a facility 13 (e.g. individual residence, apartment, condominium,
   business, etc.) is shown. The fiber optic network 11 includes a feeder cable 15 from a
    central office (not shown). The feeder cable 15 enters a feeder cable input location 17 (e.g.,
    a fiber distribution hub, a network interface device, etc.) having one or more optical
    splitters (e.g., 1-to-8 splitters, 1-to-16 splitters, or 1-to-32 splitters) that generate a number
15  of individual fibers. In the present disclosure, the feeder cable input location 17 will be
   referred to as a fiber distribution hub 17. It will be understood, however, that the feeder
    cable input location 17 is not limited to being a fiber distribution hub 17. In the subject
    embodiment, and by way of example only, the fiber distribution hub 17 is located on a
    lower level 19 of the facility 13. Each unit in the facility 13 includes a fiber optic
20  enclosure, generally designated 21, mounted to a structure or mounting location (e.g., a
   wall, etc.). Each of the fiber optic enclosures 21 includes a first cable 22 (e.g., a subscriber

    The termination module 29 of the fiber optic enclosure 21 serves as the dividing line
   between incoming fibers of a first cable (e.g., the subscriber cable 22) and outgoing fibers
    of the second cable 23. As the termination module 29 has been described in detail in U.S.
   Patent Application Serial No. 11/762,427, entitled "Modular Optical Wall Box Enclosure",
10  filed on June 13, 2007 and hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety, the termination
   module 29 will only be briefly described herein. The termination module 29 includes a
    frame, generally designated 37, that includes a plurality of sidewalls 39. In the subject
    embodiment, two of the sidewalls 39 include cable ports 40 which allow fiber optic cables
   to be routed out of the housing 25 to a desired end location. The frame 37 has a front
15 portion 41 and a back portion 43. The termination module 29 further includes a front panel
   45, a rear panel 47, and a stepped panel portion, generally designated 48. In the subject
    embodiment, the front panel 45 is generally parallel to the rear panel 47 and is located
    adjacent the front portion 41 of the frame 37. The stepped panel portion 48 extends from
   the front panel 45 to the rear panel 47 and includes first and second intermediate panels 49,
20  51 that are separated by a step 53. In the subject embodiment, the first and second
    intermediate panels 49, 51 angularly extend between the front panel 45 and the rear panel
    47.
    Referring now to FIGS. 2A and 3, the first intermediate panel 49 defines a termination
25 bank opening 55 and a plurality of termination bank fastener openings 57, which are
    disposed adjacent to the termination bank opening 55. A termination bank, generally

    intermediate panel 51 using the storage bank fastener openings 63. An exemplary storage
   bank 65 that is suitable for use with the fiber optic enclosure 21 has been described in U.S.
   Patent No. 7,218,827, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.
 5 Referring now to FIGS. 4 and 5, the termination bank 59 is adapted to receive a plurality of
    adapters, generally designated 401. The adapters 401 are SC-type adapters 401, although it
   will be understood that the scope of the present disclosure is not limited to SC-type
    adapters 401. As the SC-type adapter 401 was described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,317,663, which
    is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety, the SC-type adapter will only be briefly
10  described herein. The SC-type adapter includes a main body 403 with a pair of tabs 405,
   407 located on the exterior of the main body 403. The tabs 405, 407 serve to support the
    adapter 401 in the termination bank 59. The adapter 401 further includes a pair of retaining
    clips 409, 411, with one retaining clip 409, 411 associated with each tab 405, 407. A front
    side 413 of the adapter 401 is inserted into the termination bank 59. As the adapter 401 is
15  inserted through the termination bank 59, the retaining clips 409, 411 compress against the
   main body 403. The adapter is inserted into the termination bank 59 until the tabs 405, 407
    abut the termination bank 59. With the tabs 405, 407 abutting the termination bank 59, the
   retaining clips 409, 411 decompress on the opposite side of the termination bank 59,
   thereby retaining the termination bank 59 between the retaining clips 409, 411 and the tabs
20 405,407.
   Referring now to FIGS. 2 and 6, the base 31 will be described. In the subject embodiment,
   the base 31 includes a panel, generally designated 71, having a front side 73 and a back
    side 75. The panel 71 of the base 31 further includes a plurality of sides 77. In the subject
25  embodiment, the base 31 is pivotally engaged to the back portion 43 of one of the
    sidewalls 39 of the termination module 29. In the subject embodiment, the pivotal
    engagement is accomplished by a hinge 79 disposed on the back portion 43 of one of the
    sidewalls 39 of the termination module 29 and one of the sides 77 of the base 31. The
   pivotal engagement between the termination module 29 and the base 31 allows the
30  interface between the termination module 29 and the base 31 to be selectively opened and
    closed, hi the open position (shown in FIG. 2 and 6), the termination module 29 can be

   I: \tId\Interwovn\NRPortbl\DCC\TLD\16080424 Idocx-29 It 2017

   pivoted away from the front side 73 of the panel 71 to provide access to the back portion
   43 of the termination module 29. In the closed position (shown schematically in FIG. 7),
   the front side 73 of the panel 71 and the interior surfaces of the sidewalls 39 of the frame
    37 define an interior region 83 of the housing 25. In addition, the back side 75 of the base
 5  31 and the outer surfaces of the sidewalls 39 of the frame 37 define the exterior surfaces of
   the housing 25.
    The panel 71 of the base 31 defines a cable passage 85 that extends through the back side
    75 and front side 73. In a preferred embodiment, the cable passage 85 is chamfered with
10 the opening of the cable passage 85 at the front side 73 of the base 31 being larger than the
    opening of the cable passage 85 at the back side 75. The chamfer provides bend radius
   protection for cable passing through the cable passage 85 by eliminating perpendicular
    corners. The panel 71 further defines a plurality of mounting holes 87.
15 Referring now to FIG. 7, a cable spool, generally designated 89, is disposed on the back
    side 75 of the base 31 such that the cable spool 89 is disposed on the exterior surface of the
   housing 25. The cable spool 89 includes a first axial end 91, an oppositely disposed second
    axial end 93, and a spooling portion 95 disposed between the first and second axial ends
    91, 93. The first axial end 91 is rigidly engaged with the back side 75 of the base 31. In the
20  subject embodiment, the rigid engagement of the base 31 and the first axial end 91 of the
    cable spool 89 is provided by a plurality of fasteners 97 (e.g., bolts, screws, rivets, etc.). In
    a preferred embodiment, the fasteners 97 are countersunk into the first axial end 91 so as
   not to interfere with the payout of the subscriber cable 22. The fasteners 97 extend through
   the first axial end 91 of the cable spool 89 and through the mounting holes 87 in the panel
25  71 such that ends of the fasteners are disposed within the interior region 83 of the housing
   25 when the base 31 and termination module 29 are in the closed position. In the subject
    embodiment, retainers 99 (shown in FIG. 6), such as nuts, rivet heads, cotter pins, etc.,
   maintain the fasteners 97 in the mounting holes 87 and thereby rigidly retain the cable
    spool 89 to the back side 75 of the base 31.
30
   In one embodiment, outer diameters of the first and second axial ends 91, 93 of the cable

                                                                - 11
    spool 89 are greater than or equal to a height H of the fiber optic enclosure 21. In another
    embodiment, outer diameters of the first and second axial ends 91, 93 of the cable spool 89
    are greater than or equal to a length L of the fiber optic enclosure 21. In another
    embodiment, outer diameters of the first and second axial ends 91, 93 of the cable spool 89
 5  are less than the length L of the fiber optic enclosure 21. In another embodiment, outer
    diameters of the first and second axial ends 91, 93 of the cable spool 89 are less than the
   height H of the fiber optic enclosure 21.
   In the subject embodiment, the cable spool 89 defines an axial bore 101 that extends
10 through the first and second axial ends 91, 93. The axial bore 101 is adapted to receive a
    spindle 103 having a central axis 105. The spindle 103 includes a mounting plate 107
   having a plurality of mounts 109 for mounting the mounting plate 107 to a wall. As the
    cable spool 89 is connected to the housing 25, the engagement between the axial bore 101
    of the cable spool 89 and the spindle 103 allows the cable spool 89 and the housing 25 of
15 the fiber optic enclosure 21 to rotate unitarily about the central axis 105 of the spindle 103.
   It will be understood that the term "unitarily" as used in the specification and the claims to
    describe the rotation of the cable spool 89 and the enclosure 28, or components of the
    enclosure 28, means that the cable spool and the enclosure 28 rotate in unison. In a
   preferred embodiment, a bearing (e.g., a needle bearing, ball bearing, roller bearing,
20 bushing, etc.) is disposed between the axial bore 101 and the spindle 103.
   Referring still to FIG. 7, the subscriber cable 22 is coiled around the spooling portion 95 of
   the cable spool 89. In order to protect the subscriber cable 22 from attenuation resulting
    from the coiling of the subscriber cable 22 around the spooling portion 95, the cable spool
25  89 has an outer circumferential surface 111 having a radius that is greater than the
    minimum bend radius of the subscriber cable 22. The subscriber cable 22 includes a first
    end 113 (shown in FIG. 6), which is inserted through the cable passage 85 (shown in FIG.
    6) in the panel 71, and a second end 115. As previously stated, the subscriber cable 22 can
    include multiple optical fibers. In the subject embodiment, each of the multiple optical
30  fibers of the first end 113 of the subscriber cable 22 would have a connectorized end that is
    in connected engagement with the rear side of the termination bank 59. The connectorized

   I: \tId\Interwovn\NRPortbl\DCC\TLD\16080424 Idocx-29 It 2017
                                                                - 12
    ends of the subscriber cable 22 would be adapted for optical connection with connectorized
    ends of the second cable 23 (shown in FIG. IA). It will be understood, however, that the
    scope of the present disclosure is not limited to the first end 113 having connectorized ends
    since the optical fibers of the first end 113 of the subscriber cable 22 could be spliced to a
 5 plurality of pigtails having connectorized ends. In an alternate embodiment, the first end
    113 could be optically connected to the second cable 23 by a splice connection disposed
   within the enclosure 28.
    The second end 115 of the subscriber cable 22 is configured for connectivity with the fiber
10  distribution hub 17. However, as shown in FIG. 1, the length of subscriber cable 22 needed
   between each of the fiber optic enclosures 21 in the facility 13 and the fiber distribution
   hub 17 will vary depending upon the location of each fiber optic enclosure 21 with respect
   to the fiber distribution hub 17.
15 A method of installing and using the fiber optic enclosure 21 to account for the varying
    lengths of subscriber cable 22 needed between the fiber optic enclosure 21 and the fiber
    distribution hub 17 will now be described. The fiber optic enclosure 21 provides dual
    functionality by serving as a storage location for the subscriber cable 22 and by selectively
   paying out a desired length of the subscriber cable 22.
20
   A first length of subscriber cable 22 is stored in the fiber optic enclosure 21 by coiling the
    length of subscriber cable 22 around the cable spool 89. The first length of subscriber cable
   22 includes an installation length, which is sufficiently long to extend from the mounting
    location of the enclosure 28 to the fiber distribution hub 17, and an excess length, which is
25 the length of subscriber cable 22 remaining on the cable spool 89 after the installation
    length has been paid out. In one embodiment, the first length is greater than or equal to
    about 100 feet. In another embodiment, the first length of subscriber cable 22 is greater
   than or equal to about 200 feet. In another embodiment, the first length of subscriber cable
   22 is greater than or equal to about 300 feet. In another embodiment, the first length of
30  subscriber cable 22 is greater than or equal to about 400 feet. In another embodiment, the
    first length of subscriber cable 22 is greater than or equal to about 500 feet. In another

   I: \tId\Interwovn\NRPortbl\DCC\TLD\16080424 _.docx-29 I 2017
                                                                - 13
    embodiment, the first length of subscriber cable 22 is in the range of about 100 to about
   2,000 feet. In another embodiment, the first length of subscriber cable 22 is in the range of
    about 100 to about 1,500 feet. In another embodiment, the first length of subscriber cable
   22 is in the range of about 500 to about 1,500 feet. In a preferred embodiment, the first
 5  length of subscriber cable 22, which is coiled around the cable spool 89, is in the range of
    100 to 500 feet. With the cable spool 89 disposed on the exterior surface of the housing 25,
   the interior region 83 of the housing 25 can be much more compact since a cable storage
    area is not required in the interior region 83. In addition, the fiber optic enclosure 21 with
   the cable spool 89 can provide more effective cable management for a greater length of
10  subscriber cable 22 than a fiber optic enclosure without the cable spool 89.
   In one embodiment, a second length, or the excess length, of subscriber cable 22 is stored
    around the cable spool 89 after the first length of subscriber cable 22 has been paid out. If
   the first length of subscriber cable 22 is greater than the installation length of subscriber
15  cable 22, the second length, or excess length, is stored around the cable spool 89.
    The second function of the fiber optic enclosure 21 involves the selective payout of the
    subscriber cable 22. As previously mentioned, the first end 59, which is disposed in the
    interior region 83 of the housing 25. In one embodiment, the first end 113 of the subscriber
20  cable 22 is in connected engagement with adapters 401. Yet, even with this engagement
   between the first end 113 of the subscriber cable 22 and the termination bank 59, the
    subscriber cable 22 can still be paid out without disrupting the connection between the first
    end 113 and the adapter 401 as the cable spool 89 and the adapters rotate about an axis in
   unison. As previously stated, the cable spool 89 is rigidly engaged with the housing 25 and
25 the axial bore 101 of the cable spool 89 is engaged with the spindle 103 such that the cable
    spool 89 and housing 25 can selectively rotate about the central axis 105 of the spindle
    103. Therefore, with the spindle 103 mounted to the wall and the fiber optic enclosure 21
    engaged with the spindle 103, the desired length of the subscriber cable 22 can be paid out
    from the fiber optic enclosure 21 by rotating the fiber optic enclosure 21 in a rotational
30  direction 117 (shown as a dashed arrow in FIG. 7) about the central axis 105 of the spindle
    103. Since the housing 25 and the cable spool 89 rotate unitarily about the central axis 105

   I: \tId\Interwovn\NRPortbl\DCC\TLD\16080424 _.docx-29 I 2017
                                                                - 14
    of the spindle 103, the second end 115 of the subscriber cable 22 can be paid out without
   the first end 113 of the subscriber cable 22 being pulled out of the termination bank 59.
    Once the desired length of subscriber cable 22 has been paid out, the rotation of the fiber
    optic enclosure 21 is ceased. At this point, the position of the fiber optic enclosure 21 can
 5 be fixed such that it does not rotate relative to the spindle 103. In the subject embodiment,
    a pin 119 is inserted through an opening 121 in the second axial end 93 of the cable spool
    89 and through a corresponding opening 123 in the mounting plate 107 to fix the position
    of the fiber optic enclosure 21. In a preferred embodiment, the fiber optic enclosure 21 is
    fixed in position when the fiber optic enclosure 21 is generally level.
10
   An alternate method of selectively paying-out subscriber cable 22 from the fiber optic
    enclosure 21 will now be described. With the fiber optic enclosure 21 positioned near the
    fiber distribution hub 17, the second end 115 of the subscriber cable 22 is unwound from
   the cable spool 89. In one embodiment, the second end 115 is optically connected to the
15  fiber distribution hub 17. With the second end 115 of the subscriber cable 22 optically
    connected to the fiber distribution hub 17 and the first end 113 of the subscriber cable 22 in
    connected engagement with the termination bank 59, the fiber optic enclosure 21 is
   transported away from the fiber distribution hub 17. In one embodiment, the fiber optic
    enclosure 21 is carried away from the fiber distribution hub 17 by an installer. In another
20  embodiment, the fiber optic enclosure 21 is transported away from the fiber distribution
   hub 17 in a wheeled cart (e.g., dolly, 4- wheeled cart, etc.). In a preferred embodiment, the
    fiber optic enclosure is disposed in a packaging enclosure (e.g., a box) during transport. As
   the fiber optic enclosure 21 is transported away from the fiber distribution hub 17, the
    subscriber cable 22 unwinds from the cable spool 89 causing the cable spool 89 and the
25 housing 25 to rotate within the packaging enclosure. When the fiber optic enclosure 21 has
   been transported to its mounting location, the fiber optic enclosure 21 is removed from the
   packaging enclosure, mounted to the mounting location and fixed in position.
   Referring now to FIGS. 8 and 9, an alternate embodiment of a fiber optic enclosure 221 is
30  shown. The fiber optic enclosure 221 includes a housing, generally designated 223 a cable
    spool, generally designated 227, a bearing mount, generally designated 229 (shown in FIG.

   I: \tId\Interwovn\NRPortbl\DCC\TLD\16080424 _.docx-29 I 2017
                                                                - 15
    9), and a mounting plate, generally designated 231.
   Referring now to FIG. 10, the housing 223 includes a cover 225, a base 233, a first
    sidewall 235, and an oppositely disposed second sidewall 237. The first and second
 5  sidewalls 235, 237 extend outwardly from the base 233 such that the base 233 and the first
    and second sidewalls 235, 237 cooperatively define an interior region 239.
   A termination module, generally designated 241, is disposed in the interior region 239 of
   the housing 223. The termination module 241 of the fiber optic enclosure 221 serves as the
10  dividing line between the incoming fibers and the outgoing fibers. In the subject
    embodiment, the termination module 241 is mounted to the base 233 of the housing 223.
   In the subject embodiment, the termination module 241 includes an adapter plate 243
   having adapter slots 245. The adapter slots 245 are adapted to receive the plurality of
15  adapters 401 (shown in FIGS. 3 and 4).
   Referring now to FIG. 11, the base 233 of the housing 223 defines a cable passage 247
   through which incoming optical fibers pass. The interior region 239 of the housing 223
    includes a slack storage area 249 in which is disposed a plurality of bend radius protectors
20 251. Each of the bend radius protectors 251 is sized such that an outer radius of the bend
   radius protector 251 is larger than the minimum bend radius of the optical fiber so as to
    avoid attenuation damage to the optical fibers during storage. In the subject embodiment,
   the cable passage 247 is disposed between the slack storage area 249 and the termination
   module 241. As incoming optical fibers pass through the cable passage 247, the incoming
25  optical fibers are routed to the slack storage area 249. Connectorized ends of the incoming
    optical fibers are then routed from the slack storage area 249 to the front sides 413 of the
    adapters 401. Connectorized ends of outgoing optical fibers are routed from the back sides
    of the adapters 401 and through fiber exit ports 253 which are disposed in the first and
    second sidewalls 235, 237.
30
   Referring now to FIG. 9, the cable spool 227 is disposed on an exterior of the housing 223.

   I: \tId\Interwovn\NRPortbl\DCC\TLD\16080424 Idocx-29 It 2017
                                                                - 16
   In the subject embodiment, the cable spool 227 is disposed on the back side of the base
   233. The cable spool 227 includes a first axial end 255, an oppositely disposed second
    axial end 257, and a spooling portion 259 disposed between the first and second axial ends
   255, 257. The first axial end 255 is rigidly engaged (i.e., non-rotatable) to the back side of
 5 the base 233. In the subject embodiment, the rigid engagement of the base 233 and the first
    axial end 255 of the cable spool 227 is provided by a plurality of fasteners (e.g., bolts,
    screws, rivets, etc.). In one embodiment, the fasteners are countersunk into the first axial
    end 255 so as not to interfere with the payout of a subscriber cable 222. The fasteners
    extend through the first axial end 255 of the cable spool 227 and through a plurality of
10 mounting holes 261 (shown in FIG. 11) in the base 233 such that ends of the fasteners are
    disposed within the interior region 239 of the housing 223. In order to retain the cable
    spool 227 to the back side of the base 233, the fasteners may be threaded into the base 233
    or retained by a plurality of retainers, such as nuts, rivet heads, cotter pins, etc.
15  The first axial end 255 of the cable spool 227 includes a passage 262. During engagement
    of the first axial end 255 and the back side of the base 233 of the housing 223, the first
    axial end 255 of the cable spool 227 is mounted to the base 233 such that the passage 262
    is aligned with the cable passage 247. With the passage 262 of the cable spool 227 and the
    cable passage 247 of the base 233 aligned, incoming optical fibers, which are coiled
20  around the spooling portion 259 of the cable spool 227, can enter the housing 223.
    The bearing mount 229 includes a first plate 263 and a second plate 265. In the subject
    embodiment, each of the first and second plates 263, 265 of the bearing mount 229
    includes a central hole 267 having a central axis 269 (shown as a dashed line in FIG. 3).
25  The first and second plates 263, 265 are connectedly engaged through a bearing, such as a
   ball bearing. The bearing allows the second plate 265 to rotate about the central axis 269
    when the first plate 263 is fixed.
    The first plate 263 of the bearing mount 229 is rigidly engaged to the second axial end 257
30  of the cable spool 227. In the subject embodiment, the rigid engagement of the first plate
    263 of the bearing mount 229 and the second axial end 257 of the cable spool 227 is

   provided by a plurality of fasteners (e.g., bolts, screws, rivets, etc.). The fasteners extend
   through a plurality of mounting holes 271 in the first plate 263 of the bearing mount 229
    and through a plurality of mounting apertures 273 in the second axial end 257 of the cable
    spool 227.

    The second plate 265 of the bearing mount 229 is rigidly engaged to the mounting plate
   231. The mounting plate 231 includes a base panel 275 and a plurality of sidewalls 277
   that extend outwardly from the base panel 275. The base panel 275 includes a plurality of
   holes 279 for rigidly engaging the base panel 275 to the second plate 265 of the bearing
10 mount 229. In the subject embodiment, a plurality of fasteners (e.g., bolts, screws, rivets,
    etc.) provides the rigid engagement of the base panel 275 and the second plate 265. The
   base panel 275 further includes a plurality of apertures 280 for mounting the fiber optic
    enclosure 221 to a wall.
15 Referring now to FIGS. 1, 12 and 13, the subscriber cable 22, which includes multiple
    optical fibers, is coiled around the spooling portion 259 of the cable spool 227. In order to
   protect the subscriber cable 22 from attenuation resulting from the coiling of the subscriber
    cable 22 around the spooling portion 259, the cable spool 227 has an outer circumferential
    surface 281 having a radius that is greater than the minimum bend radius of the subscriber
20  cable 22. The subscriber cable 22 includes a first end having connectorized ends, which are
    inserted through the passage 262 and the cable passage 247 and connectedly engaged with
   the first end 413 of the adapter 401. The second end of the subscriber cable 22 is
    configured for connectivity with the fiber distribution hub 17. However, as shown in FIG.
    1, the length of subscriber cable 22 needed between each of the fiber optic enclosures 221
25  in the facility 13 and the fiber distribution hub 17 will vary depending upon the location of
    each fiber optic enclosure 221 with respect to the fiber distribution hub 17.
   A method of selectively paying-out the subscriber cable 22 will now be described. As
   previously mentioned, the first end of the subscriber cable 22 is in connected engagement
30  with the termination module 241, which is disposed in the interior region 239 of the
    housing 223. With the first end of the subscriber cable 22 in connected engagement with

   I: \tId\Interwovn\NRPortbl\DCC\TLD\16080424 _.docx-29 I 2017

   the front sides 413 of the adapters 401 and the outgoing optical fibers disengaged from the
   back sides of the adapters 401, the subscriber cable 22 can be paid out. As previously
    stated, the first axial end 255 of the cable spool 227 is rigidly engaged to the housing 223
    and the second axial end 257 of the cable spool 227 is engaged with the first plate 263 of
 5 the bearing mount 229 such that the cable spool 227 and housing 223 can selectively rotate
    about the central axis 269 of the bearing mount 229. Therefore, with the second plate 265
    of the bearing mount 229 mounted to the mounting plate 231 , which is mounted to a wall,
   the desired length of the subscriber cable 22 can be paid out from the fiber optic enclosure
   221 by rotating the fiber optic enclosure 21 in a rotational direction about the central axis
10 269 of the bearing mount 229. Since the housing 223 and the cable spool 227 rotate
   unitarily about the central axis 269 of the bearing mount 229, the second end of the
    subscriber cable 22 can be paid out without the first end of the subscriber cable 22 being
   pulled out of the termination module 241. Once the desired length of subscriber cable 22
   has been paid out, the rotation of the fiber optic enclosure 221 is ceased. At this point, the
15 position of the fiber optic enclosure 221 can be fixed such that it does not rotate relative to
   the bearing mount 29.
   Referring now to FIG. 14, a bracket 283 can be used to secure the position of the fiber
    optic enclosure 221 after the rotation of the fiber optic enclosure 221 has ceased. In the
20  subject embodiment, the bracket 283 is an L-shaped bracket having an upper portion 285
    and a lower portion 287. It will be understood, however, that the scope of the present
    disclosure is not limited to the bracket 283 being an L-shaped bracket. A plurality of thru
   holes 289 are defined in the upper and lower portions 285, 287 of the bracket 283. The
   thru-holes 289 in the lower portion 287 of the bracket 283 align with holes 291 in the
25  sidewalls 277 of the mounting plate 231 while the thru-holes 289 in the upper portion 285
    of the bracket 283 align with holes 293 in the first and second sidewalls 235, 237. In the
    subject embodiment, fasteners are inserted through the thru-holes 289 in the upper and
    lower portions 285, 287 of the bracket 283 and connectedly engaged to the housing 223
    and the mounting plate 231 , respectively. With the bracket 283 engaged with the housing
30 223 and the mounting plate 231 , the housing 223 and cable spool 227 cannot move
   relative to the mounting plate 231, thereby fixing the position of the fiber optic enclosure

   221.
   In an alternative method of installing and using the fiber optic enclosure 221 to account for
   varying lengths of subscriber cable 22, the cable spool 227 is disengaged from the housing
 5 223. The subscriber cable 22 is then paid out from the cable spool 227 such that the cable
    spool 227 rotates about the central axis 259 of the bearing mount 229. With the desired
    length of subscriber cable 22 paid out, the housing 223 is then engaged to the first axial
    end 255 of the cable spool 227. The connectorized ends of the first end of the subscriber
    cable 22 are passed through the passage 262 in the first axial end 255 of the cable spool
10 227 and through the cable passage 247 in the base 233 of the housing 223. With the
    connectorized ends of the subscriber cable 22 disposed in the interior region 239 of the
   housing 223, the connectorized ends are connectedly engaged with the first ends 413 of the

                                                                            - 29
   member 755 in sliding contact. The mating bearing surface 771 is disposed at an angle                                    p,
    which is measured from the plane in which the second end surface 769 is disposed as
    shown in FIG. 29. In the subject embodiment, the angle                                 P is about equal to the angle a. In
    another embodiment, the angle                               P is an oblique angle less than about 90 degrees. In another
 5  embodiment, the angle                           P is in the range of about 30 degrees to about 75 degrees.      In another
    embodiment, the angle                           P is in the range of about 45 degrees to about 60 degrees.
    In the subject embodiment, an outer periphery of the puck member 757 is sized slightly
    smaller than the inner bore 763 of the ring member 755. This difference in size between
10  the outer periphery of the puck member 757 and the inner bore 763 of the ring member 755
    creates a clearance 773 between the ring member 755 and the puck member 757. This
    clearance 773 allows for rotation of the puck member 757 in the ring member 755
    following dimensional expansion of the outer periphery of the puck member 757, which
    results from heat generated from rotation of the puck member 757 in the ring member 755.
15  In one embodiment, the clearance 773 is filled with silicon grease or other lubricant to
   reduce the amount of heat generated.
   Various modifications and alterations of this disclosure will become apparent to those
    skilled in the art without departing from the scope and spirit of this disclosure, and it
20  should be understood that the inventive scope of this disclosure is not to be unduly limited
   to the illustrative embodiments set forth herein.
