                           muscle training gear
Belonging to the technical field
  The innovation patent can directly transmit signals to the muscles and
 promote the movement of the muscles through the current stimulation,
  especially for the muscle training gear which can relieve the muscle
   fatigue, strengthen the muscle strength and shape the muscle lines.
Background technique
      At present, the well-known smart fitness instrument on the market
consists of an abdominal instrument, a controller, and a hydrogel sticker.
The hydrogel paste affixed to the abdominal device at the patch, the
controller connected with the abdominal device, start the controller,
abdominoscope and muscle paste Department will produce the
corresponding current by the current to stimulate the muscles, so as to
achieve exercise effect, however, many fitness apparatus set a wide
range of frequency, different frequencies of different degrees of muscle
stimulation, the effect is also a big difference, and some may also
damage the muscles.
Content of the invention
     in order to overcome the deficiencies of the existing intelligent
                                        1

fitness equipment on the muscle caused by the frequency difference and
the exercise effect, the innovation patent provides an intelligent fitness
equipment which is based on the theory of sports medicine and focuses
on the muscular mechanism and compares and verifies a number of
different frequency of exercise, not only can effectively play a role in
muscle training, but also can ease muscle fatigue and strengthen muscle
strength.
      The technical scheme adopted by the innovation to solve the
technical problem is that the smart core of the controller adopts the EMS
microelectronic technology and the independently developed CMH pulse
of 20 Hz and keeps the good tension after a certain period of time under
the stimulation of 20 Hz, So you can conclude that 20Hz can continue to
effectively exercise the muscles.
      The innovation has the beneficial effects that the muscle can be
prevented from being aged, weak and the structure is simple while
effectively exercising the muscle.
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS FIG
      The innovation will be further described below with reference to
the accompanying drawings and embodiments.

Detailed Description
      In Figure 1, the power connector (3), the cable (2), the hydrogel
patch (4) are connected. Usually, the current generated by the Hertz is
different. In order to ensure the most effective and safe current output,
the controller's smart core Using EMS microelectronic technology,
independently developed 20Hz CMM pulse.

The claims
1. The intelligent fitness apparatus is sequentially connected with the
main body of the abdominoscope, the hydrogel tape and the power
interface and the controller. The innovation is characterized in that the
hydrogel sticking on the main body of the abdominometer is pasted with
the human body, the controller is connected with the power interface,
after the muscle produces a 20Hz CMM pulse.
2. According to the intelligent fitness apparatus of claim 1,
characterized in that: the smart core of the controller adopts the EMS
microelectronic technology and independently developed CMH pulse of
20Hz, and the 20Hz can continuously and effectively exercise the muscle
