A system comprising one or more processors configured to receive data relating to vehicles
associated with a transportation network formed from interconnected routes; wherein the one or
more processors are further configured, based at least in part on the data, to determine origin and
destination pairs for different vehicle systems formed from different groups of the vehicles and
traveling in the transportation network, each of the vehicle systems having a respective plurality
of the vehicles that travel together, to identify the vehicles included in the different vehicle
systems, and to direct one or more display devices to display different graphical representations
of the vehicle systems based on the vehicles included in the vehicle systems on a map of the
transportation network that is displayed on one of the one or more display devices, wherein the
one or more processors are configured to display the graphical representations of the vehicle
systems (i) each as a respective spatial sequence of the plurality of vehicles in the vehicle system
relative to one another and (ii) the graphical representations are displayed larger on the display
for vehicle systems having a larger number of vehicles and smaller for vehicle systems having a
smaller number of vehicles and (iii) the graphical representations include numbers or other
indicia to indicate the number of vehicles in each vehicle system.

FIELD
[0002]          Embodiments of the present disclosure generally relate to systems and methods
for monitoring vehicles and routes within transportation networks.
BACKGROUND
[0003]          Some cargo shippers have issues of having to track each railcar of trains
individually to capture statuses of a single shipment. Many of these shippers use unit trains,
which have dedicated engine power to move railcars for only that shipper. For example, some
shippers want to know what is happening with the cargo traffic of the shippers, across
transportation networks utilized by the shippers. Some known cargo tracking systems focus on
the details of individual railcars first, with a drill-up management of the information from
individual railcars. This can involve tracking significant amounts of data and, as a result, some
of the more important, high-level information can be lost to the shippers or be difficult to obtain
in an expedient manner.
[0004]          Additionally, tracking the details of railcar mileage has been a problem of the rail
industry for decades. Many shippers lease railcars from private railcar owners, and the leases for
these railcars can have mileage limitations and/or maintenance schedules that are based on the
miles traveled by the railcars. Shippers may be required to incorporate mileage into the everyday
planning of cargo shipments. Some shippers calculate railcar mileage in highly manual manners
and these calculations typically are estimates at best.
                                                  1

[0005]          The information that is used to track cars and cargo can be provided from a
variety of sources, such as waybills, car location messages (CLMs), manifests, or the like. In
some circumstances, this information can be communicated to a tracking system via a web
service data feed.     This type of web service communication can require two systems to
communicate via a common schema that both system can recognize. A common schema may
incorporate the data structure, parent/child hierarchy relationships, and data element names.
Most systems, however, do not have identical formats. For example, the waybill or CLM may
use a different name to refer to a location of a car than is used by a tracking system that receives
the waybill or CLM data, the location of the car may be nested inside a different data hierarchy
in the waybill or CLM than in the tracking system, etc. In order for the correct data in the
waybill or CLM to be placed into the proper location in the tracking system to allow for the
tracking system to monitor the cars or cargo, the data may need to be translated to enable the
tracking system to understand and import the data. This can be a resource intensive task that is
both costly and time consuming.
[0006]          A reference herein to a patent document or other matter which is given as prior art
is not to be taken as an admission that the document or matter was known or that the information
it contains was part of the common general knowledge as at the priority date of any the claims.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0033]          Certain embodiments of the present disclosure provide systems and methods for
displaying various aspects of a transportation network and/or vehicles moving within the
transportation network.     A transportation network can include interconnected routes, such as
tracks, roads, waterways, paths in the air, or the like, over which vehicles can travel between
various locations. These vehicles can include automobiles, rail vehicles, off-highway vehicles
(e.g., mining vehicles or other vehicles that are not legally permitted or designed for travel on
public roadways), marine vessels, airplanes, or the like. The transportation network can include
two or more different types of routes, such as waterways that meet up with or otherwise intersect
tracks or roads at a port, shipping locations (e.g., airports, warehouses, etc.) where tracks and
roads meet up, or the like. The transportation network can extend over a large area and may
include many vehicles concurrently traveling in the network. One or more embodiments of the
inventive subject matter described herein provide for improved techniques for tracking and/or
displaying movements, statuses, or the like, of the vehicles and/or routes in the transportation
network.
[0034]          Figure 1 illustrates one example of a vehicle system 100 that may travel in a
transportation network as described herein. The vehicle system 100 includes multiple vehicles
102, 104 that travel together along one or more routes 106 of the transportation network. The
vehicles 102 (e.g., units 102A-C) represent propulsion-generating vehicles that are capable of
producing tractive effort to propel the vehicles 102. Examples of propulsion-generating vehicles
102 include locomotives, automobiles, trucks, marine vessels, airplanes, etc. The vehicles 104
(e.g., units 104A-E) represent non-propulsion-generating        vehicles that are not capable of
producing tractive effort. Examples of non-propulsion-generating vehicles 104 include rail cars,
trailers, barges, or the like. The vehicles 102, 104 may be mechanically connected with each
other, such as by couplers 108, to travel together as the vehicle system 100 along the routes 106.
Alternatively, the vehicles 102, 104 may not all be mechanically connected with each other. For
example, the vehicles 102 may be connected with the vehicles 104, but not with other vehicles
                                                  7

102, such that the vehicles 102 separately move the vehicles 104.          The vehicles 102 may
communicate with each other to coordinate their movements so that the vehicles 102, 104 move
along the routes 106 together. One example of the vehicle system 100 includes a rail vehicle
consist, such as a train. Optionally, the vehicle system 100 may represent a truck pulling one or
more trailers, a boat pushing or pulling one or more barges, an airplane, etc. In one embodiment,
the vehicle system 100 may not include the non-propulsion-generating vehicles 104.
[0035]          Figure 2 illustrates one embodiment of a transportation monitoring system 200.
The system 200 includes one or more processors 202, which can represent hardware circuitry
that includes and/or is connected with one or more processors, controllers, or other electronic
logic-based devices. The system 200 also includes one or more input devices 204, such as a
keyboard, electronic mouse, microphone, touchscreen, or the like. The system 200 includes one
or more display devices 206, such as a monitor, television, smart phone, touchscreen (e.g., the
same or different touchscreen as the input device 204), or the like. The system 200 also includes
a memory 208, which can represent one or more computer hard drives, random access memories,
read only memories, or the like. The processor 202 can perform various operations described
herein based on computer readable instructions (e.g., software) that is stored on the memory 208
or in another location.
[0036]          In one embodiment, the system 200 can provide for the monitoring and/or
management of unit vehicles. A unit vehicle can include a vehicle system 100 (shown in Figure
1) that travels from an origin location to a destination location in a transportation network to
transport the same cargo from the origin location to the destination location. With respect to the
vehicle system 100 shown in Figure 1, the vehicle system 100 may be a unit vehicle when all of
the vehicles 102, 104 in the vehicle system 100 travel from the same starting location to the same
destination location in a trip. The vehicle system 100 may not be a unit vehicle when one or
more of the vehicles 102 and/or 104 are added to or removed from the vehicle system 100 at a
location where the other vehicles 102, 104 are not added to or removed from the vehicle system
100.    For example, a vehicle system 100 traveling in a trip from Chicago, Illinois to San
Francisco, California that begins the trip with all of the vehicles 102, 104 in Chicago and ends
the trip with all of the same vehicles 102, 104 in San Francisco can be a unit vehicle, while a
vehicle system 100 that begins the trip with all of the vehicles 102, 104 in Chicago but picks up
                                                  8

one or more additional vehicles 102, 104 and/or removes one or more vehicles 102, 104 from the
vehicle system 100 in a location between Chicago and San Francisco may not be a unit vehicle.
[0037]          Alternatively, the content of a unit vehicle may be altered during a trip.        For
example, instead of the unit vehicle having the same vehicles 102, 104 for an entire trip, the unit
vehicle may have vehicles 104 added and/or removed at one or more locations between an origin
location of a trip and a destination location of the trip. In contrast, a manifest vehicle includes a
vehicle that is completely dismantled upon arrival at a major yard or junction located between
origin and destination locations of a trip. The individual vehicles 104 are re-combined onto one
or more new manifest vehicles based on the destinations of the individual vehicles 104. Unit
vehicles can be altered at the same locations, but typically maintain the vast majority of the
vehicles 104 in the unit vehicles.      A vehicle can maintain the same vehicle identification
throughout a trip, whereas a manifest vehicle may be broken up and re-built with each new
manifest vehicle receiving a new vehicle identification.
[0038]           Some entities that transport cargo from one location to another (which may be
referred to herein as "shippers") previously may have had to track each vehicle 104 individually
in order to monitor the status of a cargo shipment being carried by the vehicles 104. The status
of the shipment can include the location of the vehicles 104 carrying the cargo along the routes
106, an estimated and/or scheduled time of arrival of the vehicles 104 at the destination location
and/or one or more intermediate locations, a health or damage to the vehicles 104, among other
information.
[0039]          In one aspect, the system 200 may monitor the status of the entire unit vehicle 100
and present this information to a user of the system 200. The vehicles 102, 104 that are included
in the vehicle 100 may be provided to the system 200 via the input device 204 and stored in the
memory 208, but only the status of the entire unit vehicle 100 may be provided to the user via the
display device 206.
[0040]          Figure 3 illustrates one example of a display representation 300 (or image) that
may be presented to a user via the display device 206 of the system 200 shown in Figure 2. The
display representation 300 can be created by the processor 202 (shown in Figure 2) and
displayed on the display device 206. The display representation 300 illustrates a transportation
                                                   9

network 302 formed by several interconnected routes 106. Only three routes 106 are labeled in
Figure 3, but the transportation network 302 may include more routes 106, fewer routes 106, or a
single route 106.
[0041]          Several graphical representations 304 (e.g., graphical representations 304A-F) are
shown in the display representation 300. The graphical representations 304 can include icons
that represent different vehicle systems 100 traveling in the transportation network 302. In one
aspect, the graphical representations 304 represent different unit vehicles 100. The graphical
representations 304 can be displayed in different sizes, colors, or other appearances to indicate
differences between the unit vehicles 100. For example, the graphical representations 304 may
be larger for unit vehicles 100 having a larger number of vehicles 102 and/or 104 and smaller for
unit vehicles 100 having a smaller number of vehicles 102 and/or 104. Optionally, the graphical
representations 304 may include numbers or other indicia to indicate the number of vehicles 104
(and/or vehicles 102) in the unit vehicle 100. For example, the graphical representation 304D
may be larger than other graphical representations 304 and/or may include the number "1041"
because the graphical representation 304D represents a unit vehicle 100 having 1,041 vehicles
104 while the other unit vehicles 100 have fewer vehicles 104.
[0042]          A user of the system 200 may view or otherwise obtain additional details about
the vehicle systems 100 represented by one or more of the graphical representations 304. As one
example, the input device 204 may be used to select a graphical representation 304. In response
to this selection, the processor 202 can obtain additional information about the vehicle system
100 associated with the selected graphical representation 304 from the memory 208 or
elsewhere, and cause the display device 206 to present this information.
[0043]          Figure 4 illustrates another example of a display representation 400 (or image)
that may be presented to a user via the display device 206 of the system 200 shown in Figure 2.
The display representation 400 can be created by the processor 202 (shown in Figure 2) and
displayed on the display device 206. The display representation 400 illustrates the transportation
network 302.      The display representation 400 includes an information display 402, which
presents additional information about one or more of the vehicle systems 100 (shown in Figure
1) represented by a selected graphical representation 304.
                                                 10

[0044]           For example, in response to a user employing the input device 204 to select the
graphical representation 304F during presentation of the display representation 300 shown in
Figure 3, the processor 202 may obtain and direct the display device 206 to present the
information display 402. The information display 402 can include additional information about
the vehicle system 100 represented by the graphical representation 304F selected by the user,
such as a list of vehicles 102 and/or 104 in the vehicle system 100, the origin location of the
vehicle system 100, the destination location of the vehicle system 100, the estimated and/or
scheduled time of arrival of the vehicle system 100, the cargo being carried by the vehicles 104,
mileage of the vehicle system 100, mileage of individual vehicles 104, mileage of individual
vehicles 102, or the like.
[0045]           The processor 202 can generate user-customizable rules for use in identifying
which vehicles 104 are included in the different vehicle systems 100. For example, a user may
employ the input device 204 to identify which vehicles 104 are included in a vehicle system 100,
such as by selecting the vehicles 104 from a list, by specifying a type of the vehicles 104 (e.g.,
by the manufacturer, model number, or the like, of the vehicle 104), by specifying a cargo being
carried by the vehicles 104, etc. Based on this identification, the processor 202 can examine a
list, table, or other memory structure in the memory 208 to identify which vehicles 104 match,
meet, or otherwise satisfy the criteria or criterion provided by the user.        The user-provided
criteria optionally may include a spatial sequence of the vehicles 104 in a vehicle system 100,
such as where the vehicles 104 are located within the vehicle system 100 relative to each other.
The processor 202 may then "build" the vehicle system 100, such as by associating the vehicles
104 that match, meet, or otherwise satisfy the user-provided criteria or criterion.
[0046]           In one aspect, one or more of the criteria used by the processor 202 to determine
which vehicles 104 are included in a vehicle system 100 may be based on a history of previous
vehicles 104 included in the same vehicle system 100 for one or more previous trips of the
vehicle system 100.      For example, if the same thirty vehicles 104 are included in the same
vehicle system 100 at least a designated number of times (with the designated number being
greater than one), then the processor 202 may identify these vehicles 104 as forming a baseline
group of vehicles 104. The processor 202 may then automatically include these same vehicles
104 in the vehicle system 100 for future trips of the vehicle system 100 when the vehicles 104
                                                 11

are available for inclusion in the vehicle system 100 (e.g., the vehicles 104 are at the same origin
location for a trip of the vehicle system 100).
[0047]           The processor 202 can store these criteria that are used to identify which vehicles
104 are included in a vehicle system 100, such as in the memory 208 or another location. The
processor 202 can use the criteria to automatically determine which vehicles 104 are included in
a vehicle system 100, to automatically determine the spatial sequence of the vehicles 104 in the
vehicle system 100, to automatically add and/or remove vehicles 104 to the vehicle system 100
(e.g., when additional vehicles 104 matching the criteria are added to or removed from the
memory 208, the vehicles 104 can automatically be added to or removed from a vehicle system
100), or the like.
[0048]           The routes 106 may be presented in different manners on the display device 206.
Different graphical representations of the routes 106 can include displaying the routes 106 in
different colors, with different types of lines (e.g., dashed, solid, different types of dashes, etc.),
with lines of different thicknesses, or the like. For example, the routes 106 can be displayed as
differently colored lines that overlay a map, as shown in Figures 3 and 4. The different colors
used for the routes 106 can indicate different ownership of the routes 106, different types of
routes 106, or other differences between the routes 106. For example, all routes 106 that are
owned or maintained by the same entity (e.g., company or government) may be displayed using
the same color, type of line, or the like, while other routes 106 that are owned or maintained by
other entities may be displayed using other colors, line types, or the like. As another example,
all routes 106 of the same class (e.g., Federal Railroad Administration track classifications) may
be displayed as the same color, or the routes 106 of one class may be displayed in one color,
while all other routes 106 (even routes 106 in different classes) are displayed in the same, but
different color. In one aspect, the graphical representations 300, 400 generated by the processor
202 and shown on the display device 206 show one type of routes 106 (e.g., rail lines or tracks),
but not other types of routes 106 (e.g., roads).
[0049]           Figure 5 illustrates another display representation 500 of the transportation
network 302 shown in Figures 3 and 4 according to another embodiment.               In contrast to the
graphical representations 300, 400, the display representation 500 does not display as many
                                                  12

routes 106 in the transportation network 302 as are shown in the graphical representations 300,
400. For example, the graphical representations 300, 400 may show all of the routes 106 in the
transportation network 302, the routes 106 of a selected type or class (e.g., as selected by a user
of the system 200) but not all routes 106, or the routes 106 of another subset (but not all routes
106). The display representation 500 may display a smaller number of the routes 106.
[0050]          For example, the display representation 500 may only display routes 106A-J
instead of the many more routes 106 shown in the graphical representations 300, 400 in Figures
3 and 4. The processor 202 may select a group of routes 106A-J for display based on which
routes 106 are currently being traveled and/or are scheduled to be traveled by vehicle systems
100.   As a result, the display representation 500 may only display those routes 106 that are
currently being traveled and/or that are scheduled to be traveled by designated vehicle systems
100. A user of the system 200 may identify a group of vehicle systems 100 and/or the system
200 may automatically identified this group of vehicle systems 100 and, in response, the
processor 202 may direct the display device 206 to display the routes 106 being currently
traveled and/or that are scheduled to be traveled by these vehicle systems 100.         The vehicle
systems 100 that are identified may be identified based on whether or not the vehicle systems
100 meet one or more criteria, such as the type of cargo being carried by the vehicle systems
100, the mileage of the vehicle systems 100, the size of the vehicle systems 100 (e.g., the number
of vehicles 102 and/or 104, the weight, etc.), or the like.
[0051]          The routes 106 that are displayed in one or more of the graphical representations
300, 400, 500 may include different types of routes 106. For example, the routes 106A-H and
106K can represent over-land routes (e.g., tracks, roads, or the like), while the routes 1061-J can
represent water based routes or air routes.
[0052]           Some users of the system 200 may desire to monitor the status of a shipment of
cargo from an origin location to a destination location, but may not necessarily want to monitor
this status by individually tracking movements of individual vehicles 104. The vehicle system or
systems 100 carrying the cargo can be selected automatically (e.g., based on criteria as described
herein) and/or based on user input. The processor 202 may then examine locations of these
vehicle systems 100 (e.g., based on locations communicated from the vehicle systems 100 to the
                                                  13

processor 202, based on locations monitored by signals or other wayside devices that determine
when the vehicle systems 100 pass locations of the signals or wayside devices, based on
schedules of the vehicle systems 100, etc.) and determine which routes 106 are being traveled or
scheduled to be traveled by the vehicle systems 100. The identification of these routes 106 may
be completed by the processor 202 examining a route database or other memory structure in the
memory 208 or elsewhere, and comparing locations of the vehicle systems 100 with locations of
the routes 106 stored in the route database. Based on this comparison, the processor 202 can
determine which routes 106 are being currently traveled on or scheduled to be traveled on by the
vehicle systems 100.      The processor 202 may direct the display device 206 to display these
routes 106 and no other routes 106. As a result, these routes 106 are displayed to a user so that
the user can more easily visualize which routes 106 are being traveled by the vehicle systems
100 that are of interest to the user.
[0053]          Optionally, the processor 202 may direct the display device 206 to display the
routes 106 that are historically traveled by the vehicle systems 100 of interest to a user. The
processor 202 may examine which routes 106 are traveled at least a designated number of times
within a designated time period by one or more vehicle systems 100 that are manually selected
by the user and/or that are automatically selected based on criteria, as described above. For
example, the processor 202 can identify routes 106 that are traveled at a frequency that is greater
than a designated frequency (e.g., traveled more than five times within the last month) by the
selected vehicle systems 100. The processor 202 may direct the display device 206 to display
these routes 106 and no other routes 106. As a result, these routes 106 are displayed to a user so
that the user can more easily visualize which routes 106 are frequently traveled by the vehicle
systems 100 that are of interest to the user.
[0054]          Figure 6 illustrates another graphical representation 600 that may be displayed on
the display device 206 shown in Figure 2 according to another embodiment.               The graphical
representation 600 may be generated by the processor 202 shown in Figure 2 directing the
display device 206 also shown in Figure 2 to display origin/destination (O/D) pairs for trips of
selected vehicle systems 100 (shown in Figure 1). An O/D pair represents a set of a starting, or
origin, location of a trip and a final ending, or destination, location of the same trip. Optionally,
the O/D pair may include one or more additional intermediate locations.
                                                  14

[0055]          The memory 208 (shown in Figure 2) may store trips of vehicle systems 100, such
as the O/D pairs, scheduled times of departure from the origin location, scheduled and/or
estimated times of arrival at the destination location, the vehicle systems 100 traveling or
scheduled to travel in the trips, etc. The processor 202 can obtain information about trips of the
vehicle systems 100 and determine the O/D pairs for the trips. The processor 202 may direct the
display device 206 to display linear representations 602 in the graphical representation 600 to
represent the trips of the vehicle systems 100. The linear representations 602 may include lines
604 (e.g., lines 604A-E) that directly connect an origin location 606 and a destination location
608 for each trip of one or more vehicle systems 100. The linear representations 602 may not
extend along or indicate the shape of the path of the route or routes 106 used by the vehicle
system 100 to travel from the origin location to the destination location. For example, the routes
106 along which a vehicle system 100 travels from an origin location to a destination location
likely includes curves, twists, undulations, etc. (as shown in the graphical representations 300,
400, 500 of Figures 3 through 5), and are not perfectly linear paths. Instead of displaying the
routes 106 with the curves, twists, undulations, and the like, the processor 202 may direct the
display device 206 to present the paths taken or scheduled to be taken by the vehicle systems 100
from origin locations 606 to destination locations 608 of the trips. Alternatively, the trips may be
represented by shapes other than lines.
[0056]          Some locations are origin locations 606 for two or more trips of different vehicle
systems 100. For example, the lines 604A, 604B represent different trips for different vehicle
systems 100 having the same origin location 606 but different destination locations 608. Some
locations are destination locations 608 for two or more trips of different vehicle systems 100.
For example, the lines 604A, 604C represent different trips for different vehicle systems 100
having different origin locations 606 but the same destination location 608. Some locations may
be an origin location 606 for one trip and also a destination location 608 for another trip. For
example, the trip represented by the line 604B has a destination location 608 that is the same
location as the origin location 606 for the trip represented by the line 604E. Other locations may
only be a single origin or destination location for a single trip.
[0057]          In the illustrated embodiment, the graphical representations 602 of the trips may
include the graphical representations 304 on or near the lines 604.        As described above, the
                                                  15

graphical representations 304 can include icons that represent different vehicle systems 100
traveling in the transportation network 302. In one aspect, the graphical representations 304
represent different unit vehicles 100.     The graphical representations 304 can be displayed in
different sizes, colors, or other appearances to indicate differences between the unit vehicles 100.
For example, the graphical representations 304 may be larger for unit vehicles 100 having a
larger number of vehicles 102 and/or 104 and smaller for unit vehicles 100 having a smaller
number of vehicles 102 and/or 104. Optionally, the graphical representations 304 may include
numbers or other indicia to indicate the number of vehicles 104 (and/or vehicles 102) in the unit
vehicle 100.
[0058]          Figure 7 illustrates another display representation 700 that may be displayed on
the display device 206 shown in Figure 2 according to another embodiment.               The display
representation 700 may be generated by the processor 202 shown in Figure 2 directing the
display device 206 also shown in Figure 2 to display an information display 702.                 The
information display 702 can present additional information about one or more of the vehicle
systems 100 (shown in Figure 1) represented by a selected graphical representation 304 and/or a
selected graphical representation 602.
[0059]          For example, in response to a user employing the input device 204 to select the
graphical representation 304 associated with the graphical representation 604C and/or selecting
the graphical representation 604C, the processor 202 may obtain and direct the display device
206 to present the information display 702. The information display 702 can include additional
information about the vehicle system 100 represented by the graphical representation 604C
selected by the user, such as the current location of the vehicle system 100, the current leg of the
trip of the vehicle system 100, a list of vehicles 102 and/or 104 in the vehicle system 100, the
origin location of the vehicle system 100, the destination location of the vehicle system 100, the
estimated and/or scheduled time of arrival of the vehicle system 100, the cargo being carried by
the vehicles 104, mileage of the vehicle system 100, mileage of individual vehicles 104, mileage
of individual vehicles 102, or the like. The leg of the trip can represent a segment of a trip that
the vehicle system 100 is currently traveling along.        Different legs of the trip can include
different fractions, distances, or segments of the trip. In one aspect, different legs are identified
based on the transportation modality used in the different legs. One leg of a trip may involve
                                                  16

cargo being transported by one or more automobiles, another leg of a trip may involve the same
cargo being transported by one or more rail vehicles, or the like.
[0060]          Figure 8 illustrates another display representation 800 that may be displayed on
the display device 206 shown in Figure 2 according to another embodiment.                The display
representation 800 may be generated by the processor 202 shown in Figure 2 directing the
display device 206 also shown in Figure 2 to display different legs 802, 804, 806, 808 of a trip in
different ways.
[0061]          In response to a graphical representation being selected (e.g., manually or
automatically), such as the graphical representation 604B, the processor 202 can direct the
display device 206 to display different legs of the trip represented by the linear representation
604B with different colors, different types of lines (e.g., solid, different dashes, etc.), or in
another different manner. The lengths of the different legs may reflect the percentage or fraction
of the distance of the associated leg relative to a total length of the trip. Optionally, the lengths
of the different legs may reflect the percentage or fraction of the time scheduled or expected to
travel the associated leg of the trip relative to a total time of the trip.
[0062]          Returning to the description of the system 200 shown in Figure 2, the processor
202 optionally may monitor mileage of the vehicle systems 100 and/or the individual vehicles
102 and/or 104. Some entities (e.g., shippers) may lease vehicles 104 other entities (e.g., private
railcar owners), and the leases can have mileage limitations or maintenance schedules based on
the miles traveled by the leased vehicles 104. Additionally or alternatively, some vehicles 102
and/or 104 may have recommended maintenance schedules that dictate which repairs and/or
inspections are to be completed at different accumulations of miles traveled by the vehicles 102
and/or 104.
[0063]          In order to assist in the tracking of miles traveled by the vehicle systems 100,
vehicles 102, and/or vehicles 104 during a current trip and/or over several trips, the processor
202 may track historical and/or current mileage for each vehicle 102, 104 and present this
information to users of the system 200 via the display device 206.            The processor 202 can
determine estimated initial mileage based on a scheduled route 106 (e.g., obtained from a user, a
waybill, or the like) of a trip and/or a presumed usage of the scheduled route 106. The presumed
                                                    17

usage of the route 106 may include a fraction, percentage, or the like, of the trip that will actually
extend along the scheduled route 106. Due to repairs, maintenance, slow orders, traffic, or the
like, the vehicle system 100 may deviate from the route 106 in the trip for a portion of the trip.
The scheduled route 106 can be obtained from a schedule of the vehicle system 100 stored in the
memory 208, from a user via the input device 204, or the like.
[0064]          The processor 202 can determine actual mileage based on the actual route 106
traveled by the vehicle system 100 in a trip and/or the actual usage of the route 106. The actual
route 106 and/or the actual usage of the route 106 may be determined based on the actual
locations that the vehicle systems 100 traveled and reported to the processor 202 (or that were
obtained by the processor). While a vehicle system 100 is traveling along a route 106 for a trip,
the processor 202 can determine the remaining mileage for the vehicle system 100.
[0065]          The processor 202 can determine accumulated mileage for individual vehicles 102
and/or 104 based on the actual mileage traveled by the vehicle systems 100 and the vehicles 102
and/or 104 included in the different vehicle systems 100. For example, the processor 202 can
calculate an accumulated mileage for a railcar by adding the actual mileage of the vehicle
systems 100 that included the railcar. The processor 202 may determine historical mileage for
individual vehicles 102 and/or 104 by determining the accumulated mileage for the vehicle 102
and/or 104 during a designated time period.
[0066]          Any or all of the preceding determined mileages can be stored in the memory 208
and/or presented to the user of the system 200 on the display device 206.
[0067]          The processor 202 optionally may monitor how closely or far a vehicle system
100 travels off of the scheduled trip of the vehicle system 100. For example, the processor 202
can obtain a scheduled time of arrival of a vehicle system 100 at a destination location or other
location from a schedule of the vehicle system 100, from input received via the input device 204,
from a trip manifest, or the like. The processor 202 can monitor locations of the vehicle system
100 during the trip to determine how far behind or ahead of schedule the vehicle system 100 is
traveling. Based on the scheduled time of arrival and how far ahead or behind schedule the
vehicle system 100 is traveling, the processor 202 can calculate or estimate an estimated time of
arrival. The estimated time of arrival and/or the scheduled time of arrival can be displayed on the
                                                 18

display device 206. If the estimated time of arrival is later than the scheduled time of arrival or
is later than the scheduled time of arrival by a designated, non-zero time threshold, then the
processor 202 can generate an alert to the user that is displayed on the display device 206 or that
is communicated to a device of the user (e.g., a mobile phone, tablet computer, or the like).
[0068]          The processor 202 optionally may communicate alerts to users based on other
events. For example, when a shipment is behind schedule or experiences another exception, the
processor 202 may display an alert on the display device 204, email an alert to an email address
of a user, send a text message to a user, or the like.
[0069]          Figure 9 illustrates another display representation 900 that may be displayed on
the display device 206 shown in Figure 2 according to another embodiment. The processor 202
can direct the display device 206 to present the display representation 900. The representation
900 may provide a dashboard to a user that indicates alerts 902, such as shipments that are
behind schedule, how far behind schedule or delayed the shipments are, etc.            The display
representation 900 can include a status summary 904 of the vehicles 104, which can summarize
the statuses of the vehicles 104, such as how many vehicles 104 are loaded with cargo, how
many vehicles 104 are empty of cargo, how many vehicles 104 are stationary, how many
vehicles 104 in storage, or the like.      The display representation 900 may include a transit
summary 906 of the vehicles 104, which can summarize how long it has been since the vehicles
104 have been stationary (e.g., in terms of days, weeks, months, etc.). Additionally summaries
may be shown on the display device 206, such as a summary of estimated times of arrival of
vehicles 104 that are not carrying cargo, a summary of estimated times of arrival of vehicles 104
that are carrying cargo, how many vehicles 104 are in a fleet of vehicles 104., etc.
[0070]          Figure 10 illustrates a flowchart of a method 1000 for monitoring a transportation
network.    The method 1000 may be used to monitor and display information about vehicle
systems traveling in a transportation system.          At 1002, origin and destination pairs are
determined for vehicle systems formed from different groups of vehicles and traveling in a
transportation network formed from interconnected routes. At 1004, the vehicles included in the
different vehicle systems are identified, such as by the processor 202 shown in Figure 2
determining which vehicles 102 and/or 104 are included in the vehicle systems 100 from
                                                   19

information stored in the memory 208 shown in Figure 2.              At 1006, different graphical
representations of the vehicle systems are presented in a display on a display device based on the
vehicles included in the vehicle systems. The representations can be displayed on a map of the
transportation network that is displayed on the display device.
[0071]          Figure 11 illustrates a flowchart of another method 1100 for monitoring a
transportation network. The method 1100 may be used to monitor and display information about
vehicle systems traveling in a transportation system.        At 1102, an origin location and a
destination location for a trip of a cargo shipment are determined. At 1104, one or more modes
of transportation of the cargo shipment from the origin location to the destination location are
determined. For example, the processor 202 can determine which legs of the cargo shipment
will be transported using marine vessels and/or over marine pathways, which legs of the cargo
shipment will be transported using airborne vessels and/or over airways, which legs of the cargo
shipment will be transported using rail vehicles and/or over tracks, and/or which legs of the
cargo shipment will be transported using automobiles and/or over roads.
[0072]          At 1106, a graphical representation of the cargo shipment from the origin location
to the destination location is displayed on a display device. At 1108, the method 1100 includes
one or more of displaying information representative of a leg of the trip of the cargo shipment
that is associated with an operator selection and/or displaying different portions of the graphical
representation of the cargo shipment in different manners representative of the one or more
modes of transportation.     The displaying the information representative of the leg of the trip
and/or displaying the different portions of the graphical representation of the cargo shipment
may occur responsive to receiving an operator selection of at least part of the graphical
representation of the cargo shipment.
[0073]          While the description of the different data and graphical representations included
herein focuses on the vehicle systems 100, optionally, the data, representations, or the like, can
represent the vehicles 102 and/or 104 included in the vehicle systems 100.
[0074]          One or more embodiments of the systems and methods described herein
optionally can provide a tool that allows users of the systems and methods to define
individualized data structures for a data feeds.    For example, users can customize XML data
                                                 20

feeds to acquire data used to track movements of cars and/or cargo via one or more web service
data feeds. The systems and methods can define a standard or designated data template for a
data feed. This data feed can be a CLM data feed, a waybill data feed, or another type of data
feed. The systems and methods can be used to manipulate various data fields, hierarchy and
structure of the data fields, the names of the data fields, etc. to create a customized format for the
data received via the data feed. The customized format can be saved, and data received from
data feeds generated from one or more source systems are mapped (e.g., converted) from the
standard template (e.g., the template used by the source systems) to the customized format, and
the converted data can be passed to the end user's system for use in tracking cars and/or cargo, or
for other uses.
[0075]          The mapping systems and methods described herein reduce the typically resource
and time intensive task of data communication/integration between two external systems. The
systems and methods enable users to define and configure data formats (e.g., XML data formats)
within a web application, and translate the data to customized formats defined by users.
[0076]          Figure 12 illustrates one embodiment of a data mapping system 1200. The system
1200 may be used in conjunction with the transportation monitoring system 200 shown in Figure
2, and/or may be incorporated into the system 200.           For example, the mapping techniques
described herein as being performed by the system 1200 may be performed by the system 200.
[0077]          The system 1200 includes one or more processors 1202, which can represent
hardware circuitry that includes and/or is connected with one or more processors, controllers, or
other electronic logic-based devices. The system 1200 includes one or more input devices 1204,
such as a keyboard, electronic mouse, microphone, touchscreen, or the like. The system 1200
includes one or more display devices 1206, such as a monitor, television, smart phone,
touchscreen (e.g., the same or different touchscreen as the input device 204), or the like. The
system 1200 also includes a memory 1208, which can represent one or more computer hard
drives, random access memories, read only memories, or the like.              The processor 1202 can
perform various operations described herein based on computer readable instructions (e.g.,
software) that is stored on the memory 1208 or in another location.
                                                  21

[0078]          The system 1200 can allow a user to customize a data feed, such as an XML data
feed, received from a web service. The data feed may provide data used to track the movement
of vehicles and/or cargos (as described herein). The data feed may provide the data from various
providers 1210 ("Data Providers" in Figure 12) to the system 1200 via one or more networks
1212, such as the Internet, one or more intemets, intranets, or the like. For example, one or more
other systems, sensors, dispatch facilities, or the like, can provide data to the system 1200 via the
network 1212. The data includes information provided within a data structure that defines data
fields for the data. The data fields represent names that can be provided to different types of
data. For example, a location of a vehicle may be provided within a data field titled "Location,"
"Postal Code," "State," or the like. An identity of a train in which a vehicle is included may be
provided in a data field titled "TrainID." Some data fields are nested within other data fields in a
hierarchy defined by the data structure. For example, within a data field titled "Car," several
other data fields may be included that are filled with data representative of information about the
vehicle identified within the "Car" field. These other data fields can include, by way of example,
a starting location for the vehicle (e.g., an "Initial" data field), an identity of the vehicle (e.g., a
"Number" data field), an indication of whether the vehicle is carrying cargo (e.g.,                    a
"LoadEmptyStatus" data field), etc.       The data streams may provide different data within the
same data fields from the same or different data providers 1210 to the system 1200.
[0079]          The system 1200 can map the data in the data structures of the streams received
from the providers 1210 to a data structure that is customized and/or individualized for the
system 1200. Such a data structure may differ from data structures from one or more, or all,
other systems that receive the data streams for use in tracking movements of vehicles and/or
cargo.
[0080]          Figure 13 illustrates a display or image 1300 shown on the output device 1206 of
the mapping system 1200 shown in Figure 12 according to one example. The display 1300 can
represent the image shown on the output device 1206 as a user of the system 1200 is creating a
customized mapping of data fields 1302 in a data structure 1304 in which data provided in the
data streams from the providers 1210.       The display 1300 is generated by the processor 1202
(shown in Figure 12) for presentation on the output device 1206.
                                                  22

[0081]          The display 1300 includes an incoming data structure window 1306 representative
of the different incoming data fields 1302 in which the incoming data from the providers 1210
may be received.         The incoming     data fields   1302 include, by way of example, a
CarLocationMovement data field, which can include additional data fields, such as Car,
Commodity, Origin, and the like, data fields 1302.       Some data fields 1302 may be nested or
included    within  other data     fields 1302.     For example, the     TrainID,  JunctionRoad,
BadOrderReasonCode, HoldDelayCode, and EstimatedRepairHoldHours data fields 1302 may
be included within the Shipment data field 1302.        The hierarchy of the data structure 1304
defines these data fields 1302 to be nested within the Shipment data field 1302. Other data fields
1302 and/or data structures 1304 (other than those shown in Figure 13) may be used. Not all
data feeds may provide data for all of the data fields 1302 shown in the window 1304.
[0082]          The display 1300 also includes a mapped data structure window 1308.           The
mapped data structure window 1308 includes one or more mapped data fields 1310. The mapped
data fields 1310 can be associated with, but different from, the incoming data fields 1302. For
example, the data included in an incoming data field 1302 may be included in a mapped data
field 1310, with the mapped data field 1310 having a different location and/or name in a mapped
data structure 1312 formed from the mapped data fields 1310.
[0083]          In order to create the mapped data structure 1312, the user may employ the input
device 1204 to select one or more of the data fields 1302 in the incoming data structure 1304.
The user may then provide input using the input device 1204 to include the selected data field
1302 in the mapped data structure 1312. For example, the user may select the data field 1302 by
clicking or otherwise selecting the data field 1302 in the incoming data structure window 1306
and moving the data field 1302 across the display 1300 to the mapped data structure window
1308. The user may change the name of the data field 1302 to a different name for the data field
1310 by double clicking on the data field 1302 in the mapped data structure window 1308 (or
otherwise indicating that the name of the data field 1302 is to be changed), and then typing or
otherwise providing the new name for the data field 1302 in the data field 1310.
[0084]          Figure 14 illustrates another example of a display or image 1400 shown on the
output device 1206 of the mapping system 1200 shown in Figure 12 according to one example.
                                                 23

The display 1400 is generated by the processor 1202 (shown in Figure 12) for presentation on the
output device 1206.      The display 1400 includes several incoming data fields 1302 in the
incoming data structure 1304 of the incoming data structure window 1306 and several mapped
data fields 1310 in the mapped data structure 1312 of the mapped data structure window 1308.
The user may create the mapped data structure 1312 by selecting and moving a set of some, but
not necessarily all, of the data fields 1302 in the incoming data field structure 1304 to the
mapped data field structure 1312. Upon moving a data field 1302 from the incoming structure
1304 to the mapped structure 1312, the data field 1302 becomes a mapped data field 1310.
[0085]          Not all incoming data fields 1302 need to be included in the mapped data
structure 1312. In the illustrated example, some of the data fields 1302 in the incoming data
structure 1304 are not included in the mapped data structure 1312, such as the "Car,"
"ShipmentWeight," and other data fields 1302. Optionally, the user may use the system 1200 to
change which data fields 1302 are included in other data fields 1302, and/or change names of the
data fields 1302. For example, instead of the "Value" data field 1302 being included in (e.g.,
nested within the hierarchy) the "ShipmentWeight" data field 1302 in the mapped structure 1312,
the user may use the system 1200 to place the "Value" data field 1302 outside of any other data
field 1310 or inside another data field 1310 in the mapped structure 1312.      As shown in the
mapped data structure window 1308 in Figure 13, the user optionally can change the name of a
data field 1302 as a data field 1310.       For example, the user can change the name of the
"Commodity" data field 1302 to a "Commoditychangename" data field 1310 in the mapped
data structure 1312.
[0086]          In operation, the user can select, move, and optionally rename one or more of the
incoming data fields 1302 to the mapped data structure 1312 as mapped data fields 1310. The
mapped data structure 1312 can be saved (e.g., in the memory 1208 shown in Figure 12) and
used to map incoming data from data feeds generated by the providers 1210 (shown in Figure
12) to the mapped data structure 1312. The table below lists several incoming data fields 1302
and corresponding mapped data fields 1310, along with the changes used by the user to map the
incoming data fields 1302 to the mapped data fields 1310. The first column in the table lists the
original incoming data field 1302, the second column in the table lists the mapped data field
1310 that corresponds with the incoming data field 1302 in the same row, and the third column
                                                  24

in the table lists the change implemented to map the incoming data field 1302 to the mapped data
field 1310 in the same row. Not all data fields 1302 shown in the Figures are included in the
table.
Incoming data field (1302)         Mapped data field (1310)         Change
Car                                Vehicle                          Changed name
     - Initial
     - Number                      Number                           Changed hierarchy
     - LoadEmptyStatus                 - CargoStatus                Changed name

     - Value                           - Value                      None
     - UnitCode
     -   Qualifier
[0087]           In the example represented by the table, the "Car" data field 1302 is included in
the mapped data structure 1312 as a mapped data field 1310 having a different name of
"Vehicle" and the "LoadEmptyStatus" data field 1312 is included in the mapped data structure
1312 as a mapped data field 1310 having a different name of "CargoStatus."          The "Initial,"
"UnitCode," and "Qualifier" data fields 1302 are not included in the mapped data structure 1312.
The "Number" data field 1302 is included in the mapped data structure 1312 with the same
name, but the hierarchy of the "Number" data field 1302 is changed in the mapped data structure
1312 so that the "Number" data field 1310 is outside of and not included or nested in the
"Vehicle" data field 1310.
[0088]           As a result, when data streams are sent from the providers 1210 that include data
in the data fields 1302 that are mapped to the mapped data structure 1312, the appropriate data is
provided to the system 1200 and/or the system 200 shown in Figure 2 using the mapped data
fields 1310. For example, data sent from the providers 1210 in the "Car" data field 1302 will be
included in the "Vehicle" data field 1310, data sent from the providers 1210 in the "Initial" data
field 1302 will not be included in any data field 1310, data sent from the providers 1210 in the
"Number" data field 1302 will be included in the "Number" data field 1310 (but not within the
"Vehicle" data field 1310), data sent from the providers 1210 in the "LoadEmptyStatus" data
field 1302 will be included in the "CargoStatus" data field 1310, data sent from the providers
1210 in the "ShipmentWeight" data field 1302 will be included in the "ShipmentWeight" data
                                                 25

field 1310, data sent from the providers 1210 in the "Value" data field 1302 will be included in
the "Value" data field 1310, and data sent from the providers 1210 in the "UnitCode" or
"Qualifier" data fields 1302 will not be included in any data fields 1310. The system 1200
and/or 200 can then use the data in the mapped data field 1312 to track movement and/or statuses
of the vehicles and/or cargo, as described herein. In response to receiving data in a data stream
from one or more of the providers 1210, the processor 1202 can identify which incoming data
field that different data are included in and which mapped data field that the incoming data field
corresponds to. The processor 1202 may then provide the data in the mapped data field to the
systems or components that use the data, such as the system 200.
[0089]           Figure 15 illustrates a flowchart of one embodiment of a method 1500 for
mapping data in one or more data streams to a customized and/or individualized data structure.
The method 1500 may be used by one or more of the systems described herein to modify the data
received in a data structure provided by one or more data providers into a data structure used by
the systems for various purposes, such as for the tracking and/or monitoring of vehicles and
cargo traveling in a transportation network. At 1502, one or more incoming data fields are
selected. The data fields may be selected for inclusion in a mapped data field structure. For
example, not all of the possible data fields in which data may be received in a data stream may
be selected for use by a system. The data fields selected for inclusion in the mapped data
structure represent the types of data that will be received and/or used by the systems.
[0090]           At 1504, the incoming data field that is selected is placed into the mapped data
structure as a mapped data field. The mapped data fields that are included in the mapped data
structure may be saved in a memory of the system. At 1506, a determination is made as to
whether the name of the data field selected for inclusion in the mapped data structure is to be
changed. For example, a determination may be made as to whether a user chose to change the
name of the mapped data field from the name used in the incoming data field. If the name is to
be changed, then the user can provide a new name or the system can provide a name to the
mapped data field (e.g., a default name). If the name is not to change, then the name of the
mapped data field can be the same as the incoming data field.
                                                  26

[0091]          At 1508, a determination is made as to whether the hierarchy of the data field
selected for inclusion in the mapped data structure is to be changed.               For example, a
determination may be made as to whether a user chose to change whether the data field selected
for inclusion in the mapped data structure is to be included within (e.g., nested within) another
data field. If the hierarchy is to be changed, then the user can provide a new hierarchy for the
mapped data field (e.g., a default heirarchy). If the hierarchy is not to change, then the hierarchy
of the mapped data field can be the same as the incoming data field.
[0092]          At 1510, the mapped data structure is generated. The mapped data structure can
associate the selected data fields, which may have different names and/or hierarchies, with the
incoming data fields. The structure can be saved in a memory and, responsive to receiving data
provided in the incoming data fields, the mapped data structure can select which data are to be
communicated in the mapped data structure, as well as the names and hierarchies of the data
fields.
[0093]          The subject matter described herein and the subject matter recited in the claims
address a challenge of tracking many different cars and cargos being transported in a wide
geographical area. This challenge is particular to the transportation industry in the modern era,
especially with respect to the large number of cars concurrently traveling in the United States at
any given time. The ability to monitor and track cars and cargos as described herein cannot be
performed as purely mental steps by a human being within a commercially reasonable time
period. Instead, the use of specially programmed computer devices (e.g., programmed according
to the description herein) to receive and/or translate data as a web service, generate displays, etc.,
to track the movements of many cars and cargos may be required. The methods and systems
described herein do not merely describe performance of a previously known business practice as
the tracking of such a large number of cars and cargos, as well as visually presenting this
information in a clear and informative way, previously was unobtainable without the subject
matter described in this application. One or more embodiments of the methods and systems
described herein are necessarily rooted in computer technology in order to overcome a problem
specifically arising in the realm of transportation networks.
                                                  27

[0094]          In one embodiment, a system (e.g., a transportation monitoring system) includes
one or more processors configured to receive data relating to vehicles associated with a
transportation network formed from interconnected routes.         The one or more processors are
further configured, based at least in part on the data, to determine origin and destination pairs for
different vehicle systems formed from different groups of the vehicles and traveling in the
transportation network, to identify the vehicles included in the different vehicle systems, and to
direct one or more display devices to display different graphical representations of the vehicle
systems based on the vehicles included in the vehicle systems on a map of the transportation
network that is displayed on one of the one or more display devices.
[0095]          In one aspect, the one or more processors are configured to determine the origin

vehicle system associated with the operator selection of the at least one of the graphical
representations.
[0098]          In one aspect, the one or more processors are configured to identify the vehicles
by determining a baseline group of the vehicles included in at least one of the vehicle systems
based on one or more of an operator-customized criterion or a history of one or more previous
trips of the vehicles.
                                                  28

[0099]          In one aspect, the one or more processors also are configured to direct the one or
more display devices to display different graphical representations of the routes of the
transportation network on the map that is displayed on the display device.
[0100]          In one embodiment, a method (e.g., for monitoring a transportation network)
includes determining origin and destination pairs for different vehicle systems formed from
different  groups of vehicles and traveling in a transportation              network formed from
interconnected routes, identifying the vehicles included in the different vehicle systems, and
displaying different graphical representations of the vehicle systems based on the vehicles
included in the vehicle systems on a map of the transportation network that is displayed on a
display device.
[0101]          In one aspect, determining the origin and destination pairs for the vehicle systems
includes, for at least one of the vehicle systems, identifying an origin location where the vehicles
in the vehicle system begin a trip to a destination location and a destination location where the
vehicles in the vehicle system end the trip.
[0102]          In one aspect, displaying the graphical representations of the vehicle systems
includes displaying one or more of different sized representations or differently colored
representations for the different vehicle systems.
[0103]          In one aspect, the method also includes receiving an operator selection of at least
one of the graphical representations via an input device and, responsive to receiving the operator
selection, displaying information representative of the vehicles in the vehicle system associated
with the operator selection of the at least one of the graphical representations.
[0104]          In one aspect, identifying the vehicles includes determining a baseline group of
the vehicles included in at least one of the vehicle systems based on one or more of an operator
customized criterion or a history of one or more previous trips of the vehicles.
[0105]          In one     aspect, the   method also includes       displaying    different graphical
representations of the routes of the transportation network on the map that is displayed on the
display device.
                                                  29

[0106]          In one embodiment, a method (e.g., for monitoring a transportation network)
includes determining an origin location and a destination location for a trip of a cargo shipment,
determining one or more modes of transportation of the cargo shipment from the origin location
to the destination location, displaying a graphical representation of the cargo shipment from the
origin location to the destination location on a display device, and one or more of: responsive to
receiving an operator selection of at least part of the graphical representation of the cargo
shipment, displaying information representative of a leg of the trip of the cargo shipment that is
associated with the operator selection, and/or displaying different portions of the graphical
representation of the cargo shipment in different manners representative of the one or more
modes of transportation.
[0107]          In one aspect, displaying the graphical representation includes displaying a
straight line on a map of a transportation network formed from interconnected routes, where the
straight line extends from the origin location on the map to the destination location.
[0108]          In one aspect, the straight line that is displayed deviates from the routes displayed
on the map.
[0109]          In one aspect, the one or more modes of transportation include two or more of rail
transportation, marine vessel transportation, air transportation, and/or automobile transportation.
[0110]          In one aspect, the different portions of the graphical representation of the cargo
shipment are displayed in different manners by displaying the different portions in one or more
of different colors, using different lines, or using different shapes based on the one or more
modes of transportation associated with the different portions of the graphical representation of
the cargo shipment.
[0111]          In one embodiment, a method (e.g., for monitoring a transportation network)
includes receiving selection of one or more incoming data fields in an incoming data structure,
the one or more incoming data fields representing different types of data that are provided by one
or more data providers via a web service to a monitoring system, determining whether one or
more of a name or hierarchy of the one or more incoming data fields that are selected are to be
changed, and generating a mapped data structure comprising one or more mapped data fields.
                                                   30

The one or more mapped data fields can correspond to the one or more incoming data fields that
are selected with the one or more of the name or hierarchy that is determined to be changed. The
mapped data structure can be used to determine which of the data provided by the one or more
data providers are to be communicated to the monitoring system in the one or more mapped data
fields.
[0112]          In one aspect, the method also includes mapping the data received in the one or
more incoming data fields that are selected to the one or more mapped data fields and using the
data received in the one or more incoming data fields that are selected for tracking movement of
one or more of vehicles or cargo within a transportation network.
[0113]          In one aspect, the mapped data structure is customized for the monitoring system.
[0114]          It is to be understood that the above description is intended to be illustrative, and

functional blocks are not necessarily indicative of the division between hardware circuitry.
Thus, for example, one or more of the functional blocks (for example, processors or memories)
may be implemented in a single piece of hardware (for example, a general purpose signal
processor, microcontroller, random access memory, hard disk, and the like).         Similarly, the
programs may be stand-alone programs, may be incorporated as subroutines in an operating
system, may be functions in an installed software package, and the like.              The various
embodiments are not limited to the arrangements and instrumentality shown in the drawings.
[0117]          As used herein, an element or step recited in the singular and proceeded with the
word "a" or "an" should be understood as not excluding plural of said elements or steps, unless
such exclusion is explicitly stated.     Furthermore, references to "one embodiment" of the
inventive subject matter are not intended to be interpreted as excluding the existence of
additional embodiments that also incorporate the recited features. Moreover, unless explicitly
stated to the contrary, embodiments "comprising," "including," or "having" an element or a
plurality of elements having a particular property may include additional such elements not
having that property.

WHAT IS CLAIMED IS:
        1.      A system comprising:
        one or more processors configured to receive data relating to vehicles associated with a
transportation network formed from interconnected routes;
        wherein the one or more processors are further configured, based at least in part on the
data, to determine origin and destination pairs for different vehicle systems formed from
different groups of the vehicles and traveling in the transportation network, each of the vehicle
systems having a respective plurality of the vehicles that travel together, to identify the vehicles
included in the different vehicle systems, and to direct one or more display devices to display
different graphical representations of the vehicle systems based on the vehicles included in the
vehicle systems on a map of the transportation network that is displayed on one of the one or
more display devices,
wherein the one or more processors are configured to display the graphical representations of the
vehicle systems (i) each as a respective spatial sequence of the plurality of vehicles in the vehicle
system relative to one another and (ii) the graphical representations are displayed larger on the
display for vehicle systems having a larger number of vehicles and smaller for vehicle systems
having a smaller number of vehicles and (iii) the graphical representations include numbers or
other indicia to indicate the number of vehicles in each vehicle system.
        2.      The system of claim 1, wherein the one or more processors are configured to
determine the origin and destination pairs for the vehicle systems, for at least one of the vehicle
systems, by identifying an origin location where the vehicles in the vehicle system begin a trip to
a destination location and a destination location where the vehicles in the vehicle system end the
trip.
        3.      The system of claim 1 or 2, wherein the one or more processors are configured to
direct the one or more display devices to display the graphical representations of the vehicle
systems by displaying one or more of different sized representations or differently colored
representations for the different vehicle systems.
                                                 33

         4.      The system of any one of claims 1 to 3, wherein the one or more processors are
configured to receive an operator selection, via one or more input devices, of at least one of the
graphical representations via an input device and, responsive to receiving the operator selection,
the one or more processors are configured to direct the display device to display information
representative of the vehicles in the vehicle system associated with the operator selection of the
at least one of the graphical representations.
         5.      The system of any one of claims 1 to 4, wherein the one or more processors are
configured to identify the vehicles by determining a baseline group of the vehicles included in at
least one of the vehicle systems based on one or more of an operator-customized criterion or a
history of one or more previous trips of the vehicles.
         6.      The system of any one of claims 1 to 5, wherein the one or more processors also
are configured to direct the one or more display devices to display different graphical
representations of the routes of the transportation network on the map that is displayed on the
display device.
