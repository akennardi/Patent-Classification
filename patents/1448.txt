ABSTRACT
       An inspection system inspects gaming chips each having
a color or a display indicating a value on an outer surface in
a state where the gaming chips are stored in a case in which
a maximum of the number of gaming chips to be stored is           limited,
and a radio  tag   storing       gaming chip information is    embedded in
each of the gaming chips.             The gaming chips are stored   in  the
case capable of containing a row of gaming chips stacked in               a
thickness direction, and the inspection system includes                 a
reading device that reads the radio tag of the gaming chip in
the case and acquires       gaming chip information of the gaming chip
and a determining unit        that   compares the gaming chip information
with a maximum of the number of gaming chips storable in the
case and determines an abnormality of the gaming chip in the
case when the number of gaming chips obtained from the gaming
chip information       is  different     from a maximum of the number of
storable gaming chips.

FIELD
 [0002]
         The present           invention relates             to an inspection       system and
an inspecting           device which are capable of inspecting                        a gaming
chip, and more particularly to, an inspection system and an
inspecting device which are capable of inspecting a plurality
of gaming chips              contained in a case.
 [0003]
         Gaming chips used in game halls                          such as      casinos   are
manufactured in             factories        and then transported             to game halls,
stored in       a storage,           and moved from the storage to cashiers or
game tables         in    the hall,       but it     is   necessary to        prevent gaming
chips from being stolen                or being replaced           with fake gaming chips
in   the process of transporting,                      storing,      and moving.       To this
end, a case containing gaming chips is used.                                  If a plurality
of gaming chips are contained in the case and, then the case
is   sealed,     it    is    possible       to discover a situation              in  which the
gaming chips           are withdrawn from the                   case after the sealing.
                                                   1

 [0004]
            As  a gaming chip in which a radio tag storing
identification            information or type information is                              internally
installed,          and optically           readable code information indicating
the identification information or the type information is
assigned to a side             surface        is    known (for         example,       JP 2009-66172
A).
 [0005]
            A system using a gaming chip is                     disclosed       in JP 2009-66172
A.      In the system, the number of gaming chips placed on a betting
board of         a   game   table       is    calculated           on the basis           of
identification            information stored                  in    a radio      tag,     the number
of gaming chips is                calculated           on the basis           of identification
information           assigned to           a    side    surface,         and the       calculated
numbers        of gaming chips are compared.                            Accordingly,           it   is
possible         to detect         an unauthorized               gaming      chip when the
unauthorized           gaming chip            is     used in       the    game table.
 [0006]
            However,      since the system disclosed                        in   JP 2009-66172              A
detects a fraud by calculating the number of bet gaming chips
 (placed on the betting                 board),        the system is           unable to inspect
a plurality           of gaming         chips       contained in           the case in          a  state
where the gaming chips are contained in                               the case and detect               the
unauthorized           gaming chip.
 [0007]
            In  this    regard,         it    is    an object          of the embodiment               to
provide an inspection                 system and an inspecting                  device which are
                                                      2

capable of inspecting a plurality      of gaming chips contained in
a case in     a state where the gaming chips are contained in       the
case.
 [0008]
          An inspection system according to a first   aspect of the
embodiment is      an inspection system that inspects a gaming chip
having at least first     gaming chip information and second gaming
chip information, the second gaming chip information is
arranged on a side surface of the gaming chip in       an optically
readable form, the inspection system includes a case that
contains a plurality       of gaming chips in a stacked manner and
an inspecting device that inspects the gaming chip contained
in the case, wherein the inspecting device includes a first
reading device that acquires the first      gaming chip information
of the gaming chip contained in the case, a second reading device
that optically reads the side surface of the gaming chip
contained in the case and acquires the second gaming chip
information,      and a determining unit that determines whether a
plurality     of gaming chips contained in the case are pass or fail
by determining the authenticity or damages of all the gaming
chips contained the case or the number of gaming chips for each
value using the first      gaming chip information acquired by the
first reading device and the second gaming chip information
acquired by the second reading device.
 [0009]
          With this configuration, since both the first reading
unit and the second reading unit acquire the first      gaming chip
                                    3

information and the second gaming chip information from the
gaming chip contained in the case, it is possible to inspect
the gaming chips contained in                 the case.       Further,   since two
pieces of information, that                is,   the  first gaming chip
information and the second gaming chip information are acquired
from the     gaming chip, and the             inspection is performed, the
pass/fail determination can be reliably performed.
 [0010]
        In  an inspection           system according to a second aspect of
the embodiment,        in  the inspection system of the first               aspect,
the first     gaming chip information and the second gaming chip
information in      a common gaming chip include common information,
and the determining unit              determines that     a plurality     of gaming
chips contained in the case are fail when common information
portions of a plurality of pieces of first gaming chip
information acquired by the first               reading device do not coincide
with common information portions                  of a plurality      of pieces of
second gaming chip information acquired by the second reading
device.
 [0011]
        With this    configuration,         when an unauthorized gaming chip
in which the common information portion                of the first    gaming chip
information does          not coincide with the           common information
portion    of the second gaming chip information is                   contained in
the case,     the determining unit can determine that the gaming
chips contained in the               case are fail.
 [0012]
                                            4

          For example, when common identification information is
recorded in the radio tag and the side              surface,    fail  is
determined if a plurality of pieces of identification
information read out from a plurality of radio tags do not
coincide completely with a plurality of pieces of
identification information read out from a plurality of side
surfaces.        Further,    when a value of the gaming chip is     recorded
in the radio tag and the side surface, fail is determined if
the number of each value read from the radio         tag does not coincide
with the       number of each value read from the side            surface.
 [0013]
          In an inspection system according to a third aspect of
the embodiment,          in the inspection    system of the first    aspect,
both or      either of the      first gaming chip information and the
second gaming chip information includes individual
identification information individually identifying the
gaming chip.
 [0014]
          In  an inspection     system according to a fourth       aspect of
the embodiment,          in the inspection system of the first       aspect,
the    second gaming chip information includes            information
indicated by a designated color              indicating the value of       the
gaming chip and is           information indicating the value of the
gaming chip through the designated color.
 [0015]
          In an inspection system according to a fifth aspect of
the embodiment,          in the inspection    system of the third    aspect,
                                           5

both the first         gaming chip information and the second gaming
chip information include individual identification
information,         and a plurality            of gaming chips contained in         the
case are determined to be fail when the                           individual
identification information of a plurality of pieces of first
gaming chip information acquired by the first reading device
does not       coincide with the              individual identification
information of a plurality of pieces                           of second gaming chip
information acquired by the                     second reading device.
 [00161
           With this   configuration,              when an unauthorized gaming chip
in which the individual             identification            information of the first
gaming chip information does not coincide with the individual
identification information of                        the second gaming chip
information is contained in the case, the determining unit
determines that        the gaming chips contained in the case are fail.
 [0017]
           In the    inspection system of                  the first aspect,   an
inspection       system according to               a sixth    aspect of the embodiment
includes a storage unit that stores the individual
identification information of at least the first gaming chip
information or the second gaming chip information of a plurality
of gaming chips to         be contained in             the case,   and the determining
unit     determines that         a plurality           of gaming chips contained in
the case are fail when the individual identification
information of a plurality of pieces                           of first gaming chip
information acquired by the first                      reading device or a plurality
                                                   6

of pieces of           second gaming chip information acquired by the
second reading device does not                       coincide with the              individual
identification          information of the first               gaming chip information
or the second gaming chip information stored in                                   the storage
unit.
 [0018]
            With this    configuration,          when an unauthorized gaming chip
in   which the first          gaming chip information or the second gaming
chip information is incorrect                      is contained in a case, the
determining unit can determine that the gaming chips contained
in the case are faii.
 [0019]
            For example, when the individual identification
information indicated by characters is recorded in the radio
tag, and the individual identification information indicated
by numbers is         recorded on the side surface,               a plurality          of pieces
of individual           identification information indicated by
characters        are stored         in  the storage      unit    for the radio            tag for
each case,        a plurality          of pieces of individual              identification
information indicated by numbers are stored for the side surface,
and fail       is  determined when a plurality                 of pieces of individual
identification           information read out from a plurality                           of radio
tags      do not coincide with a plurality                    of pieces of individual
identification           information stored            in   the storage         unit       for the
radio tag of the case or when a plurality                      of pieces of individual
identification information read out from a plurality of side
surfaces do not coincide with a plurality of pieces of
                                                 7

individual identification information stored in                           the storage
unit      for the side      surface of the case.
  0020]
           In the    inspection system of the first aspect,                    an
inspection system according to a seventh aspect of the
embodiment       further      includes a storage unit that stores a
correspondence relation between the                    first gaming chip
information and the second gaming chip information, and the
determining unit        determines that          the plurality        of gaming chips
contained in the case are fail when a plurality of pieces of
first gaming chip information acquired by the first reading
device and a plurality of pieces of                    second gaming chip
information acquired by the                  second reading device do not
coincide with the correspondence relation                      stored  in the storage
unit.
 [0021]
           With this   configuration,          when a gaming chip in        which the
correspondence relation between the                    first gaming chip
information and the second gaming chip information is
inaccurate is         contained in         the case,   fail       can be determined.
 [0022]
           For example, when the identification information is
recorded in      the radio      tag,     and the value is       recorded in   the side
surface,      any value is      allocated      to each piece of identification
information and stored in                the storage unit, the number of each
value      is obtained with reference to the                    storage unit for a
plurality      of pieces of identification            information read out from
                                              8

the plurality        of radio        tags,   and fail      is  determined when the
number of each value read out from the side surface does not
coincide with the obtained number of each value.                        Conversely,
the same applies           when the value is         recorded in     the radio  tag,
and the identification information is recorded in the side
surface.       In these     cases,      the storage     unit   need not store  which
case contains a gaming chip of which identification
information.
 [0023]
          In an inspection system according to an eighth aspect of
the embodiment,         in  the inspection         system of any one of the first
to seventh aspects,              the determining unit           determines that a
plurality      of gaming chips contained in                 the case are fail   when
the     number of pieces of the first                 gaming chip information
acquired by the first             reading device and the number of pieces
of the second gaming chip information acquired by the second
reading device are not                a predetermined number.
 [0024]
          With this configuration, when the gaming chip is
withdrawn from the case or the gaming chip is                    added to the case,
the determining unit can determine that the gaming chips
contained in the           case are fail.
 [0025]
          For example, when the number of gaming chips contained
in the case is      100,    fail    is determined when any one of the number
of pieces of the first gaming chip information read from the
radio tag and the number of pieces of the second gaming chip
                                              9

information read from the            side     surface is not 100.
 [0026]
          In an inspection system according to a ninth aspect of
the embodiment, in the inspection system of any of the first
to eighth aspects,          the gaming chip includes color information
indicating the value of the gaming chip as the second gaming
chip information,          and includes value information identifying
the value of the gaming chip as the first           gaming chip information,
and the determining unit          determines that      a plurality of gaming
chips contained in the case are fail when the color information
does not coincide with the value information of the first gaming
chip information.
 [0027]
          In an inspection system according to a tenth aspect of
the embodiment,         in  the inspection system of the ninth aspect,
the second gaming chip information further includes value
information of the gaming chip in addition to the color
information, and the determining unit determines that a
plurality     of gaming chips contained in           the case are fail   when
the value of the gaming chip indicated by the color information
in the second gaming chip information does not coincide with
both or either of the value information of the second gaming
chip information and the value information of the first                gaming
chip information.
 [0028]
          In an inspection      system according to an eleventh aspect
of the embodiment,          in the inspection      system of any one of the
                                         10

first     to tenth    aspects,         the gaming chip includes            a radio    tag
having the        first gaming chip information.
 [0029]
          In an inspection         system according to         a twelfth     aspect of
the embodiment,         in the inspection system of any one of the first
to    eleventh aspects,        at   least   either    or both of the first         gaming

<Structure of gaming chip>
           FIG. 2 is a perspective view of the gaming chip C according
to    an embodiment of the present                      invention,        and FIG.       3 is     a side
view of        the gaming chip C according to an embodiment of the
present        invention.        The gaming chip C has a designated                                 color
layer      501 which is        characterized               by a designated color                  in   the
middle and a common color layer 502 which is                                   characterized by
a common color            on both sides           of the designated color layer                        501
in    the middle in         a thickness            direction           (upper and lower sides
in    FIG.    3),    and a stripe          pattern         (in     the thickness         direction)
is formed on             the side surface.
 [0085]
           An RFID tag 503 is            inserted          between the designated                   color
layer      501 and one common color layer                           502 of the gaming chip C
as a     radio      tag.     For example,              individual         identification
information individually identifying                                  (uniquely specifying)
the gaming chip C and value (type) information are stored in
the RFID tag           503 as the gaming chip information of the gaming
chip C.        Atransparent          layer      504 is      formed as the outermost layer
of the gaming chip C.               In other        words, the gaming chip C includes
the designated color              layer        501 which is           an intermediate            layer,
the common color layers 502 sandwiching the designated color
layer      501 from both sides,              and the transparent                layers      504 which
are the outermost             layers of both sides.
                                                    33

 [0086 ]
           The gaming chip C is        formed such that        five    elongated layers
of plastic materials              (the transparent            layer     504,     the      common
color      layer 502,      the designated color layer                   501,     the      common
color layer 502,           and the transparent layer 504)                    are stacked,
the RFID tag       503 is    arranged between the designated color                         layer
501 and one common color              layer     502 at     a predetermined interval
at that time,          and the five          layers of plastic materials are
thermocompression bonded and then punched into                          a circular         shape,
a rectangular shape, or the like through a press so that one
RFID tag     503 is    included in one gaming chip C.                 When the punching
is   performed through the press,                 dimensions of a die and a punch
of a mold for punching are designed,                       and R treatment            (rounded
corner)      is  applied     to the end of the transparent                    layer       504 of
the outermost          layer.
 [0087]
           The transparent         layer      504   may be     formed by
thermocompression           bonding three           layers     including         the
designated       color layer        501 and the two common color layers                        502
and then applying varnish                 to    the surface.          Further,        the
designated       color layer        501 and the two common color layers                        502
may not be separate          members,       and the designated color                layer      501
and the two common color layers                    502 may be formed by applying
the designated color            (and the common color) to the side                     surface
through inkjet printing or the like after                       the designated color
layer      501 and the two common color layers                      502 are integrally
formed.

 [0088]
           The designated         color layer     501 indicates      the value (type)
of the gaming chip C using a color                      (a designated color).          In
other      words,    the color of the designated              color layer     501 is  set
to a different color                (red, green, yellow, blue, or the like)
in    accordance with the value of the gaming chip C,                       and thus it
is   possible     to   specify      the value of the gaming chip C (10 points,
20 points, 100 points, 1000 points, or the like) by checking
the color of the designated                 color layer    501 optically       read from
the side surface of the gaming chip C.                        A color common to the
gaming chips          C having different values                 (a common color)      is
assigned to the common color layer 502.                          The common color is
preferably        a color      lighter      than any designated color,           and the
common color is white in the present embodiment.
 [0089]
           Code information            505   indicating the gaming chip
information of the gaming chip C is further inscribed on the
side      surface of the gaming chip C                  (specifically, the        common
color layer        502 of the side         surface).      The code information 505
indicates information by arranging a plurality                       of marks (square
marks in      the present         embodiment) .       Since the designated color
layer      501 indicates         information       (the value of the gaming chip
C) with color, whereas the code                     information 505        indicates
information with a mark inscribed                   on the side surface,        the code
information 505 can be regarded as notation information.
Examples       of the notation information include a plurality of
character       strings, a numeric string, and a bar                      code.
                                               35

 [0090]
           The code information                  505 of the present               embodiment is
repeatedly          inscribed           with a cycle of 600 in             a  circumferential
direction         of the gaming chip C.                  Accordingly,        the perfect           code
information 505 is                   included within a range of 1200 in                         the
circumferential               direction        regardless          of a direction           in  which
the     side     surface        of the gaming chip C is observed in the
circumferential               direction.          A repetition           cycle of the gaming
chip C is         not limited             to 600 and may be repeatedly                   inscribed
at equal intervals in the circumferential direction at least
three times.
 [0091]
          The code information 505 is                   inscribed        using invisible           ink.
In the present embodiment, printing is performed by inkjet
printing using infrared absorbing ink                                  (specifically, carbon
black)      that     absorbs infrared             rays as the invisible               ink.       Since
only a portion            on which the code information 505 is                      printed        does
not reflect          infrared         rays,   the code information 505 floats                      when
the     side surface of the gaming chip C is photographed by the
infrared camera 225.                     In order to cause the printed portion to
float clearly,              the infrared         camera 225 may be equipped with an
infrared        lamp and irradiate              the side        surface    of the gaming chip
C to be photographed with infrared rays.
 [0092]
           Further,         the invisible         ink is      not limited      to the infrared
absorbing ink and may be,                     for example, infrared reaction ink
that      emits fluorescence in                response to infrared               rays or UV ink
                                                    36

which emits fluorescence in                    response to        ultraviolet        rays.     In
the case of using the UV ink, the ultraviolet camera is used
in place          of the infrared camera 225,                  and black light           which
irradiates the               side surface of the gaming chip C with
ultraviolet rays is used to cause the UV ink to emit
fluorescence.
 [0093]
            Further,        in the gaming chip C,          a mark m'         using the UV ink
or the carbon black ink is                  formed on a surface                X of the common
color layer 502.               The mark m'      indicates whether the gaming chip
5 is      true or        false, and the mark m'             becomes visible when
irradiated           with ultraviolet         rays     (or infrared           rays),  and it   is
indicated whether the                 gaming chip 5 is true or                    false  in
accordance with a combination of shapes of the mark m'                                  and the
number        of marks m' .          The  transparent         layer       504    is
thermocompression bonded or applied                        on the outermost layer              so
as to      cover a print         506   (such as 100 points)             for specifying       the
game hall         or the mark m'       on the surface,        but embossing treatment
or vanish treatment is applied to the transparent layer 504,
and thus the gaming chips C are prevented from adhering to each
other, and slipping is                  further       improved.
 [0094]
            The R treatment            (R) is performed on the end of the
transparent           layer    504 of the outermost layer              which has undergone
a print 506            (100 points or the like),                and the surface of the
common color layer              502 is    prevented from being deformed in                   the
process of punching the gaming chip C and appearing on the side
                                                 37

surface.            Further,           a sharp edge of the gaming chip C is             prevented
from remaining and damaging a hand and other gaming chips C.
The designated                 color layer          501 may be formed by one or a plurality
of colored layers.                       Further,       metal or ceramics        for increasing
the weight of the layer may be formed in the layer of the
designated             color layer             501.      Further,    the RFID tag      503 may be
installed           in     a space which is             formed in   a part   of the designated
color       layer         501 or between the designated                    color layer       501 and
the     common color                 layer      502.

            FIG.      4 is        a diagram illustrating              an example of an image
obtained by photographing a plurality of gaming chips C
contained in                the case 100 through the infrared                    camera 225 and
the visible light camera 226.                               In this case, the case 100 may
be a two-stage chip float                             (an upper tray portion which is
particularly                 movable in           a two-stage chip tray)         or a chip tray
which holds the gaming chip C in                             the game table.       Even when the
gaming chip C is                 stacked in the case 100 in the vertical                direction
as illustrated                 in FIG.      4,   the infrared     camera 225 and the visible
light camera 226 can photograph the code information 505.
Further,          it      is    possible         to count the number of gaming chips C
by counting the designated color layer                                  501   in the vertical
direction.                Even with the two-stage tray,                     when each     stage is
developed,             it     is   possible          to capture the side surfaces              of all
the gaming chips C contained in the case 100 through the infrared
camera 225 and the visible                             light camera       226.

           In the present embodiment, the code information 505 is
indicated by the marks m arranged in a plurality of rows and
a plurality        of columns.     FIG.   5 is a diagram for         describing        a
configuration          of the code information 505.           As illustrated         in
FIG. 5, upper and lower marks m are paired to form one code
element.        In the example of FIG.      5,   one piece of code information
505 is      configured with a 10-digit          code element.     There are four
types of patterns          of one code element constituted             by a pair     of
upper and lower marks m,            four types of        information can be
indicated by one code element as illustrated                 in FIG. 5,      and thus
the     code information 505        configured with the          10-digit code
element can indicate           10-th power of 4 types of information.                  A
character Y on the            side of the      10-digit code element            is a
direction       determination      mark Y for       determining the direction
of the code information 505.

<Configuration of case>
           FIG.   7 is    a perspective        view of a case 100.            The case 100
is formed by combining the upper portion 101                              and the       lower
portion      102.      In   the present embodiment,            the upper portion             101
and the lower portion 102 are made of transparent resin.                                       As
described above,             since the infrared camera 225 and the visible
light camera 226 of the inspecting device 200 of the present
embodiment         (hereinafter referred to              simply as a "camera")
installed       above the receiving             unit  210,   it   is   necessary for           at
least      the upper surface            of the case 100 to transmit             light.         In
other words,         in   the case 100,        a portion positioned between the
receiving       unit     210 of the inspecting          device 200 and the camera
when the case 100 is              received      by the receiving         unit   210 of the
inspecting        device 200 needs to be a light             transmitting          portion.
In    the present       embodiment,         the case 100 has a sealed structure
including the upper portion 101 and the lower portion 102,                                   but
the light transmission portion may be in a perforated state.
 [0102]
           As described above,             the case 100 has a shape in            which the
five     columns in which 20 gaming chips C are stacked and contained
are formed in          parallel,         and in   the example of FIG.           7,     a cross
section of each column is polygonal                       (octagonal) so that                the
upper portion         101 and the lower portion          102 substantially              follow
                                                41

the     shape of       the gaming chip C to be contained.
 [0103]
            FIG.    8 is   a perspective view of a case 100'                 according to
a modified example,                and FIG.  9 is    a plan view of the case 100'.
The case 100'            also includes an upper portion 101'                   and a lower
portion 102 made of a transparent                        resin.     In the present
modified example,              the upper surface of the upper portion                    101'
facing        the camera        is   formed as     a   plane   surface.         Since   the
surface        facing the camera is           a plane surface,           a linear     shadow
caused by a corner of a polygon cross section of the case 100'
does not appear on the camera as illustrated                          in   FIG.   9,  and it
is possible to accurately identify information                               of the    side
surface of the gaming chip C in image analysis on a captured
image of        the camera.

<Use state of             inspection system>
            FIG.    10 is    a diagram for       describing       an example        of a use
state      of the inspection           system 1 together       with the distribution
of the gaming chips C.                  The gaming chip C is            manufactured by
a manufacturing device 301 of a factory F (s1), and 100 gaming
chips C are          contained in         the case      100  (s2) .      The case     100 is
sealed with a seal at the factory F after the gaming chips C
are contained.              Further,     the bar code BC indicating                the case
identification            information uniquely specifying                 the case 100 is
affixed to the side surface of the case 100                              (s3).
 [0105]
            At this    time,      the case identification           information of the

bar code BC affixed         to   the case 100 is        input to the manufacturing
management device 302 in              the factory       F (s4) .  Further,       the case
100 containing the gaming chips C is transferred to the
inspecting device 200,               the gaming chip information                 (to be
described later         in detail)      assigned to the gaming chip C is read,
and the pass/fail           inspection        is     performed.    The gaming           chip
information read from the gaming chip C contained in                            the case
100 is   transferred         to the manufacturing management device 302
 (s5) and associated with the case identification information
through the manufacturing management device 302.                             The
manufacturing management device 302 may be a personal computer.
 [0106]
        The case 100 determined to be pass in the inspecting                        device
200 of the factory           F is    conveyed from the factory             F to      a game
hall P     (s6) .    The case 100 is           first     stored in    a storage R in
the game hall        P   (s7) .    The inspecting          device 200 is      installed
in  the storage      R,   and the case 100 that           arrived   from the factory
F is   inspected through the              inspecting device 200.
 [0107]
        Meanwhile, the case identification information and the
gaming chip information associated                    with the case identification
information are transmitted               from the manufacturing management
device 302 in the factory F to the use management device 303
in  the game hall        P.    The use management device 303 acquires                    the
case identification           information and the gaming chip information
associated with the case identification information from the
manufacturing management device 302 for each of a plurality                                of

The use management device 303 may be a personal computer.
 [0108]
           In the inspection performed by the inspecting device 200
in the storage R,              an inspection is performed using the
information stored              in   the use management device 303.                  The case
100 determined to be pass in the inspection in the storage R
is carried to a game table T                       (s9) or carried to a cashier CA
 (s10).      Each of the game table I and the cashier CA includes
the     inspecting device 200,                   and the   case 100      containing the
gaming chip C is            inspected          by the inspecting        devices 200 in        a
sealed state.          In     the game table          T and the cashier         CA,  the case
100 containing          used gaming chips C is               also   inspected,        and the
inspecting device 200 is                   also used for the inspection.                 In the
inspection        in the three          inspecting      devices 200 in         the game hail

is   read out from the visible                  light       camera 226.       The identifying
unit 230 analyzes             (the image of) the numeric string read out
from the infrared            camera          225,     identifies        a  number,    specifies

C can be acquired in accordance with an arrangement order of
the gaming chips C in             the case 100,              but the information acquired
from a plurality           of RFID tags              503      is   unable to   be acquired in
accordance with the arrangement order of the gaming chips C.
In   other words,      it    is    difficult           to    specify    a gaming chip C from

           Next, a pass/fail determination method in the computer
222     of the    inspecting device 200         will be described.        As
described above,          the identifying unit 230 specifies the gaming
chip information stored in the RFID tags 503 of                     each of      a
plurality of gaming chips C contained in the case 100 on the
basis      of a result     of reading the RFID reader 221,         analyzes the
infrared       image obtained by the infrared           camera 225,   specifies
the     gaming chip information indicated by the notation
information,         analyzes the visible       light   image obtained by the
visible light camera 226,               and specifies the color of the
designated        color layer     501.    On the basis    of the information,
the determining unit          231 determines the authenticity/damage               of
all    the gaming chips contained in the case or the number of gaming
chips of        each value on the basis of the            information, and
determines whether the case 100 is pass or fail.                      In the
following description, the gaming chip information stored in
the RFID tag 503           is referred to as        "first gaming chip
information",          and the notation     information assigned to the side
surface      of the gaming chip C and the color information of the
designated color layer 501 are referred to as "second gaming
chip information".
 [0115]
 (First pass/fail determination method)
           In a first pass/fail determination method, the first
gaming chip information and the second gaming chip information
in    the same gaming chip are the same information as illustrated
in    FIG.    13.   In   an example of FIG.        13, the  first   gaming      chip
                                           47/

information is       information including the individual
identification information and the value information of each
gaming chip C, and the same content as the first gaming chip
information is      inscribed      on the side     surface      in   a form of the
notation information as the second gaming chip information.
 [01161
          The RFID reader 221 reads the first                gaming chip
information from the RFID tag          503 of the gaming chip C and outputs
the first     gaming chip information to          the identifying           unit   230,
the infrared camera 225 photographs the side surface of the
gaming chip C,     and the identifying       unit   230 specifies          the second
gaming chip information.            In this  case,    in   the identifying         unit
230,    a correspondence relation between a plurality of pieces
of first     gaming chip information and a plurality                   of pieces of
second gaming chip information is unclear.
 [0117]
          The determining unit        231 compares a plurality              of pieces
of first gaming chip information obtained by the identifying
unit     230 with a plurality of pieces            of second gaming chip
information, and when a plurality            of pieces of first          gaming chip
information completely correspond to a plurality                       of pieces of
second gaming chip information in            a one-to-one manner,             that  is,
when all     pieces of first     gaming chip information coincide with
any one of second gaming chip information without overlapping,
the determining unit 231 determines that a plurality                        of gaming
chips C contained in         the case 100 are pass,        but when a plurality
of pieces of      first gaming chip information obtained by the
                                          48

identifying unit 230 do not completely coincide with a plurality

        As a case in    which a plurality   of pieces of first     gaming
chip information obtained by the identifying unit 230 do not
completely coincide with a plurality        of pieces of second gaming
chip information, there is       a case in which any one of the gaming
chips C contained in       the case 100 is   a fake or a case in    which
the RFID tag 503 or the side surface of the gaming chip C is
damaged.    In other words,     the determining unit 231 determines
whether a plurality       of gaming chips C contained in     the case 100
are pass or fail      by determining the authenticity/damage of all
the gaming chips contained in the case 100.
 [0119]
 (Second pass/fail determination method)
        In a second pass/fail determination method, the first
gaming chip information and the second gaming chip information
in the same gaming chip C are the same information as illustrated
in  FIG.  14.   In    an example of FIG.   14,  the first    gaming chip
information is      the value information of each gaming chip C, and
in  each gaming chip C, the designated color is          assigned to the
designated color layer 501 of the side surface as the second
gaming chip information.
 [0120]
        The RFID reader 221 reads out the first gaming chip
                                      49

information from the RFID tag           503 of the gaming chip C and outputs
the first       gaming chip information to          the identifying          unit   230,
the visible light camera 226 photographs the side surface of
the gaming chip C,            and the identifying unit 230 analyzes the
image and specifies the second gaming chip information                              (the
color of        the designated color         layer   501).
 [0121]
            In this     case, in the    identifying unit 230,             a
correspondence relation            between a plurality         of pieces of first
gaming chip information and a plurality of pieces of second
gaming chip information is unclear, a plurality of pieces of
first gaming chip information may overlap each other, and a
plurality        of pieces of second gaming chip information may also
overlap with each other.             In the first     gaming chip information
and the second gaming chip information of FIG. 14,                    "r"    indicates
red,      "b" indicates     blue, "y" indicates      yellow, and "g" indicates
green.
 [0122]
           When the number of each of all         the designated        colors     (red,
blue, yellow, and green) in a plurality               of pieces of first          gaming
chip information obtained by the identifying                   unit   230 coincides
with the number of each of all the designated                  colors     (red, blue,
yellow, and green) in a plurality of pieces of second gaming
chip information,           the determining unit       231 determines           "pass",
and otherwise, the determining unit 231 determines "fail".
 [0123]
           As a case in    which the number of each of all the designated
                                          50

colors       in the first.    gaming chip information does not coincide
with the        number of each of all           the designated colors           in a
plurality        of pieces of second gaming chip information,                    there
is    a   case in   which any one of the gaming chips C contained in
the case 100 is          a fake or a case in          which the side surface of
any of the gaming            chips C is       damaged.     In   other    words,   the
determining unit           231 determines whether a plurality                of gaming
chips C contained in the case 100 are pass or fail                    by determining
the number of all           the gaming chips C contained in              the case 100
for each value.
 [0124]
 (Third pass/fail determination method)
            In a third pass/fail determination method, the first
gaming chip information and the second gaming chip information
in the same gaming chip C are different information as
illustrated        in  FIG.   15.   In    an example of FIG.         15,  information
of an English character string is stored in the RFID tag 503
of the gaming chip C as the first                gaming chip information,            and
the notation information of a numeric string is inscribed on
the side surface of the gaming chip C as the second gaming chip
information.
 [0125]
            The RFID reader 221 reads out the                 first gaming chip
information from the RFID tag              503 of the gaming chip C and outputs
the first       gaming chip information to the identifying unit 230,
the      infrared camera 225 photographs the                  side surface of        the
gaming chip C,        and the identifying        unit   230 specifies       the second

gaming chip information.             In this     case,   in the identifying        unit
230,      a correspondence relation between a plurality of pieces
of first         gaming chip information and a plurality                of pieces of
second gaming chip information is unclear.
 [0126]
           The first      gaming chip information and the second gaming
chip information are stored in the use management device 303
in   association         with the case identification         information of the
case      100.     The determining unit          231   compares    a  plurality      of
pieces of first gaming chip information obtained by the
identifying         unit   230 with a plurality        of pieces of first        gaming

 (Fourth pass/fail determination method)
            In a fourth pass/fail        determination method, the first
gaming chip information and the second gaming chip information
in the same         gaming chip C are different            information as

in    the use management device             303.        In an example     of FIG.   17,
the individual         identification        information uniquely specifying
the gaming chip C is associated with the designated color of
the designated color layer 501 of the side surface, that is,
the value information of the gaming chip C, and it                        is  possible
to   understand the value of the gaming chip C when the individual
identification          information is        designated.        In  the case of the
present        example,    the use management            device 303 need not store
a combination of            the first gaming chip information and the
second gaming chip information for each piece of case
identification           information.       In    other     words,   in  the present
example, the gaming chips              C contained in case 100               can be
inspected        without using the case identification                  information.
 [0137]
            The determining unit 231 specifies the first                  gaming chip
information corresponding to               the first       gaming chip information
identified by the identifying unit 230                       from the first gaming

the     first gaming chip information, that                    is,  the   value.    The
determining unit            231 can obtain       the number of each value in           a
plurality        of pieces of second gaming chip information extracted
from the use management device 303 for                      one case by performing
the     above process on all pieces of the                    first gaming chip
information identified by the identifying unit 230.
 [0138]
            The determining unit      231 compares the number of each value
                                            58

obtained as described above with the number of each value in
the second gaming chip information identified              for the case 100
from the identifying      unit  230.   When the numbers of each of all
the values coincide,       the determining unit        231 determines that
a plurality     of gaming chips C contained in the case 100 are pass,
and when the number of any one of the values does not coincide,
the determining unit      231 determines that a plurality          of gaming
chips C contained in the case 100            are fail.
 [0139]
          As a case in which the number of each value in a plurality
of pieces of second gaming chip information extracted from the
use management device 303 does not coincide with the number of
each value in the second gaming chip information identified              for
the case 100 from the identifying          unit   230,   there is  a case in
which any one of gaming chips C contained in the case 100 is
a fake or a case in      which the RFID tag 503 or the side surface
of the gaming chip C is     damaged.    In other words, the determining
unit     231 determines whether or not a plurality          of gaming chips
C contained in     the case 100 are pass or fail        by determining the
authenticity/damage of all       the gaming chips C contained in         the
case 100      and the number of gaming chips         C for each value.
 [0140]
          Although not illustrated, even when the value of              the
gaming chip C is      stored as the first       gaming chip information,
and the individual identification information of the gaming
chip C is      stored as the   second gaming chip information, the
pass/fail     determination can be performed similarly          to the above

 [0141]
          The first    to fifth    pass/fail      determination methods have
been described above,           but the determining unit 231 may employ
a combination of the above pass/fail              determination methods.    In
addition to the above pass/fail determination methods, when
both the number of pieces of first               gaming chip information and
the number of pieces of second gaming chip information read from
a plurality       of gaming chips C contained in         the case 100 are not
a predetermined number            (100 in the present embodiment),         the
determining unit 231 may determine that a plurality                  of gaming
chips C contained in the case 100 are fail.
 [01421
          The first    and second pass/fail        determination methods are
pass/fail      determination methods that can be executed without
using the information stored in                the use management device 303
installed      in   the game hail P and suitable when executed by the
inspecting device 200 in the factory F, the third to fifth
pass/fail determination methods are pass/fail determination

executed by the inspecting device 200 in                the game hall P,   but
the inspecting device 200 in the game hail P may employ the first
or second pass/fail           determination method.         When all  the
inspecting devices 200 in            the game hall P employ the pass/fail

          Further, the inspecting device 200 in the game hall P also
inspects the case 100 containing the used gaming chips C, but
in the case, the first,    second, or fifth pass/fail    determination
method in which information of the gaming chips to be contained
in the case need not be stored may be employed.

          Further, in the above embodiment, the gaming chip C
includes the individual identification        information and/or the
value information as the first       gaming chip information and/or
the second gaming chip information.         Here,     the individual
identification      information is  information uniquely specifying
each gaming chip C, whereas the value information is information
that can overlap each other in a plurality of gaming chips C
and can be regarded as information         (group information)
indicating a group to which each gaming chip belongs.            In the
present embodiment,      as the group information of the associated
group, instead of the value or in addition to the value, for
example, information of a gaming chip manufacturing time, a
manufacturer,      and/or a game hall in which a gaming chip is    used
may be employed.
 [0145]
           In other words, both the first gaming chip information
and the second gaming chip information may include the
individual identification information identifying the gaming

chip,     the first     gaming chip information and the second gaming
chip information may include the group information indicating
the group to which the gaming chip belongs, the first gaming
chip information may include the individual                      identification
information identifying the gaming chip, and the second gaming
chip information may include the group information of the group
to which the gaming chip belongs,                   or,   the first   gaming chip
information may include the group information of the group to
which the gaming chip belongs,                  and the    second gaming chip

<Pass/fail determination result display>
          FIGS.    18 and 19 are diagrams illustrating             an example of
a pass/fail determination result display screen illustrating
a pass/fail       determination      result      in  the determining unit      231.
These pass/fail result display screens                     are generated by the
computer 222 on the basis          of the pass/fail         determination result
in  the determining unit          231 and displayed          on the display    unit
223.     FIG.   18 illustrates      an example of a display screen in            the
case of "pass",         and FIG.  19 illustrates         an example of a display
screen in the          case of   "fail".
 [014'7]
          As  illustrated in FIGS. 18 and 19,                a pass/fail result
display screen 800 includes a total                 of the number of detections
801 which is       the number of combinations of the first             gaming chip
information and the second gaming chip information read out from
                                            62

the gaming chip C by the identifying unit 230,                        the number of
authorized        gaming chips C 802,       and the number of unauthorized
gaming chips C 803.
 [0148]
           The computer 222 sets a larger one of the number of pieces
of first        gaming chip information         and the number of pieces of
second gaming chip information as the total                       of the number of
detections        801.    For example,      when     100 gaming      chips C are
contained in        the case     100,   and one of the 100          gaming chips C
has no RFID tag 503 therein, the identifying unit 230 specifies
100 pieces of second gaming chip information from a plurality
of gaming chips C but obtains               only 99 pieces         of first       gaming
chip information.           In this   case,  the computer 222 sets           100 which
is   the larger     of the first     gaming chip information and the second
gaming chip information as the total                of the number of detections
801.
 [0149]
           In  the case of the first     or second pass/fail         determination
method,       the computer 222 decides the number of combinations of
the first        gaming chip information and the second gaming chip
information that         are determined to         coincide with each other as
the number of authorized            gaming chips C 802,        and decides a number
obtained by subtracting             the number of authorized           gaming chips
C from the total         of the number of detections             801 as the number
of unauthorized gaming chips C 803.

method,         the computer 222 decides            a  smaller one of the number
of pieces of           first gaming chip information in which the
correspondence relation with the first                   gaming chip information
stored       in   the use management device 303 has been confirmed and
the number of pieces of second gaming chip information in which
the     correspondence relation with the                  second gaming chip
information stored in the use management device 303 has been
confirmed as the number of authorized                    gaming chips C 802,         and
decides         a number obtained by subtracting the number of
authorized gaming chips C from the total of the                            number of
detections          801 as the number of unauthorized gaming chips C 803.
 [0151]
            In   the case of the fifth pass/fail            determination        method,
the computer 222 decides the number of pieces of second gaming
chip information in which the correspondence relation with the
second gaming chip information stored in the use management
device 303 has been confirmed as the number of authorized                         gaming
chips C 802,          and decides a number obtained by subtracting                   the

a modified example.                    In the gaming chip C of the above embodiment,
the designated color layer                        501 is     sandwiched between the common
color layers 502,                  but in      the example of FIG.             21,  in  the gaming
chip C',         a common color              layer      502 is      formed as the center,         and
the designated color layer 501 is formed as both                                        (upper and
