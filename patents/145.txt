                                     BACKGROUND ART
[0003]     In the fields of Controlled Source Electromagnetic Surveying and Seismic
surveying there is a desire to collect high resolution data from as many points and orientations
in the area of interest as is possible. Currently, this leads to a plurality of signal receiving
devices that are laid out in a matrix or other arrangement over the area of interest. In addition
there are various techniques that are used to move the very high data volumes collected
toward a central processing system. These methods include wireless transmission of data, data
storage and subsequent collection.

                             DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS
[0008]     The disclosed subject matter relates to the field of Controlled                Source
Electromagnetic (CSEM) Surveying, Magnetoturelics (MT), and Seismic and Micro-Seismic
                                                 1

surveying and various shortcomings in the technique related to resolution and sensitivity of
the recording instrumentation and sensors. A new sensor is provided that is a combination of
an optical fiber that has been modified to have sections along its length coated or combined
with a magnetostrictive and piezoelectric material, with the technique of spread spectrum
virtual sensors using natural fiber span reflectometers or fiber brag gratings (FBG). The
magnetostrictive material makes the fiber sensitive to magnetic field variations. The
piezoelectric material makes the fiber sensitive to electric field variations. Fibers are naturally
sensitive to acoustic or pressure waves and temperature changes.
[0009]      These types of sensors are particularly useful when recording data for
interferometry and synthetic aperture soundings with electromagnetic signals. The practical
implementation of the large sensor arrays required to make these measurements effective is
greatly simplified with the proposed electromagnetic sensitive fiber optic sensor array.
[0010]      Recent advances in techniques for depositing materials onto fiber optic cables
allow the creation of several types of sensors that improve the way in which data is collected
for both CSEM and Seismic surveying. These techniques are described along with figures of
the proposed sensors in 'Fiber-optic magnetic field sensors' by Erin Tate and 'Optic fiber
magnetic field sensors with TbDyFe magnetostrictive thin film as sensing materials' by Yang
et al. Examples of the Terfenol-D (TbDyFe) magnetostrictive material can be found at Etrema
Products of Ames, IA, both of which are incorporated by reference herein.
[0011]      Figures 1A and 1B show an embodiment of the electromagnetic sensitive fiber
optic sensor 135. The magnetostrictive material or piezoelectric material 100 is constructed in
a cylinder form with a hole through the center to allow the fiber cable 105 to be threaded and
wrapped multiple times through the magnetostrictive material 100. Examples of the
magnetostrictive material include materials such as 100 Terfenol-D (TbDyFe) which may be
found at Etrema Products of Ames, IA.
[0012]      It can be shown that the number of turns of the fiber is proportional to the
sensitivity of the sensor. For a magnetostrictive rod of length L, placed in a magnetic field of
strength B:
                                    AO=-fr~oKLnoEc          (1)

        AO  = change in phase of 1550nm laser,
        AB  =  change in magnetic field
        P = magnetostrictive sensitivity
[0013]      Careful selection of the fiber optic cable 105 will ensure minimal attenuation due
to the wrapping through the mandrel. An example of bend insensitive fiber is Corning RC
1550 and is manufactured by Dow Corning located in Canton, New York.
[0014]      The equations above shows the relationship between the change in the magnetic
field and the phase change that results from 1550 nm laser light being used to obtain a signal
that is proportional the change in unit length of the magnetostrictive material due to the
impinging magnetic field.
[0015]      Referring again to Fig la and Fig 1b, the fiber optic magnetostrictive sensor 135 is
a single axis assembly. The fiber optic cable 105 is attached rigidly at each end of the
magnetostrictive material 100 at 120 and 125. The fiber optic cable between these two points
of attachment, 120 and 125 is pre-stressed and is able to expand and contract along with the
magnetostrictive   material 100. The fiber optic cable           105 is wrapped through the
magnetostrictive material 100, multiple times.
[0016]      Using a pair of FBG's 130 and 135 allows an electronic system, such as that
specified in Reference 1, to create a value that indicates the change in the overall dimension of
the magnetostrictive material 100 that is proportional to magnetic field 140 impinging on the
sensor. The FBG's 130 and 135 are place within the fiber optic cable 105 at a position before
and after the sensor that allows a measurement to be made that will emphasis any dimensional
changes in length of the magnetostrictive material 100.
[0017]      The magnetic field 140 is also concentrated by a Permalloy flux concentrator 115
to improve sensitivity.
[0018]      The fiber optic magnetostrictive sensor 135 may be daisy chained with two other
fiber optic magnetostrictive sensors to form a 3 axis sensor that is sensitive in three orthogonal
directions
[0019]      Now referring to Figure 2. An alternate embodiment of the magnetostrictive
sensor type has a mandrel 200 that surrounds a magnetostrictive or piezoelectric material 205
that is then wrapped by a fiber optic cable 210 . The number of wraps is proportional
                                                 3

to sensitivity. The sensor can be daisy chained to form a 3 axis measurement. The Y axis 215,
the Z axis 220 and the Y axis 225.
[0020]       The piezoelectric sensor uses a relaxor electrostrictive polymers (REP) as the
loaded member. The REP sensor is preloaded to ensure resonance over the Extremely low
frequency (ELF) and Ultra low frequency (ULF) band over which the CSEM system operates.
The preloaded REP sensor is then wrapped with the fiber optic cable as shown in Fig 2. An
example of the REP material is manufactured by Piezotech S.A.S. located in H6singue
France and may be found at the following website:

[0022]       For the field of Seismic or Micro-Seismic data collection it is envisioned that the
system described in U.S. Pat. 7,268,863 may be used for monitoring Seismic waves, which is
incorporated herein by reference.
[0023]       Now referring to Figure 3. The fiber optic magnetostrictive sensor 300, fiber optic
piezoelectric sensor 305 and fiber optic pressure wave sensor 310 are created along a length of
continuous fiber optic cable and placed in a plurality of locations. The arrangement creates the
fiber optic sensor array 315.
[0024]       For example, the technique describe in U.S. Pat. 7,268,863 with the added feature
of using Fiber Brag Gratings (FBG) before and after each sensor is used to create a sensor
array that will generate data for the magnetic and electric fields returned from the sub surface
formations, once they have been excited by an electromagnetic disturbance, naturally
occurring or induced by a transmitter.
[0025]       The sensor array can also be left in place for long term data collection enabling
passive monitoring or timed active monitoring.
[0026]       An important aspect of this system that the signals be temperature and pressure
compensated. Since the effect of temperature on the fiber is linear in our region of interest and
very slowly changing compared to the signal of interest, it is relatively easy to remove the
effect. This can be verified by providing a similar fiber that is in the same environment as the
sensing fiber and recording deviations due to temperature. Additionally, the system can also
be sensitive to pressure waves. The changes are extremely weak in the operating mode and
can be ignored.

[0027]      The sensor array layout depicted in Fig. 3 is illustrative of one arrangement. And
while the receivers 301 are evenly space in Fig. 3, they may also be randomly distributed or
placed in some other geometric arrangement. These distributions affect the way in which an
interferogram will display data and will result in more information or less information being
developed for specific subsurface regions.
[0028]      In this specification, the terms "comprise", "comprises", "comprising" or similar
terms are intended to mean a non-exclusive inclusion, such that a system, method or apparatus
that comprises a list of elements does not include those elements solely, but may well include
other elements not listed.
[0029]      The reference to any prior art in this specification is not, and should not be taken
as, an acknowledgement or any form of suggestion that the prior art forms part of the common
general knowledge.
