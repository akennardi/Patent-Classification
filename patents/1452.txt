            ROTATIONAL DRILL BITS AND DRILLING APPARATUSES
                                 INCLUDING THE SAME
                                     BACKGROUND
 5         Cutting elements are traditionally utilized for a variety of material removal
   processes, such as machining, cutting, and drilling.          For example, tungsten
   carbide cutting elements have been used for machining metals and on drilling
   tools for drilling subterranean formations.       Similarly, polycrystalline diamond
   compact (PDC) cutters have been used to machine metals (e.g.,              non-ferrous
10 metals) and on subterranean drilling tools, such as drill bits, reamers, core bits,
   and other drilling tools.   Other types of cutting elements, such as ceramic (e.g.,
   cubic boron nitride, silicon carbide, and the like) cutting elements or cutting
   elements formed of other materials have also been utilized for cutting operations.
           Drill bit bodies to which cutting elements are attached are often formed of
15 steel or of molded tungsten carbide.     Drill bit bodies formed of molded tungsten
   carbide (so-called matrix-type bit bodies) are typically fabricated by preparing a
   mold that embodies the inverse of the desired topographic features of the drill bit
   body to be formed. Tungsten carbide particles are then placed into the mold and a
   binder material, such as a metal including copper and tin, is melted or infiltrated
20 into the tungsten carbide particles and solidified to form the drill bit body.    Steel
   drill bit bodies, on the other hand, are typically fabricated by machining a piece of
   steel to form the desired external topographic features of the drill bit body.
           In some situations, drill bits employing cutting elements may be used in
   subterranean mining to drill roof-support holes.        For example, in underground
25 mining operations, such as coal mining, tunnels must be formed underground. In
   order to make the tunnels safe for use, the roofs of the tunnels must be supported
   in order to reduce the chances of a roof cave-in and/or to block various debris
                                              1

   falling from the roof. In order to support a roof in a mine tunnel, boreholes are
   typically drilled into the roof using a drilling apparatus.   The drilling apparatus
   commonly includes a drill bit attached to a drilling rod (such as a drill steel).
   Roof bolts are then inserted into the boreholes to anchor a support panel to the
 5 roof. The drilled boreholes may be filled with resin prior to inserting the bolts, or
   the bolts may have self expanding portions, in order to anchor the bolts to the
   roof.
           Various types of cutting     elements, such as PDC cutters, have been
   employed for drilling boreholes for roof bolts. Although other configurations are
10 known in the art, PDC cutters often comprise a substantially cylindrical or semi
   cylindrical diamond "table" formed on and bonded under high-pressure and high
   temperature (HPHT) conditions to a supporting substrate, such as a cemented
   tungsten carbide (WC) substrate.
           During drilling operations, heat may be generated in the cutting elements
15 due to friction between the cutting elements and a subterranean formation being
   drilled, causing the drilling equipment to become worn or damaged. Additionally,
   a significant amount of debris is generated as rock material is fractured and cut
   away from the subterranean formation by the cutting elements, slowing the
   drilling process and causing the drilling equipment to become worn or damaged.
20 In order to cool the cutting elements and clear debris away from the cutting area
   during drilling, a drilling fluid such as drilling mud or air may be pumped into a
   borehole being drilled.     In some examples, the drilling fluid may be pumped
   through a hole in the drill bit to a fluid port near the cutting elements.  In other
   embodiments, a vacuum may be used to draw material away from the cutting
25 region and to cool the cutting elements.
                                             2

          Ports within drill bits for dispensing drilling fluids may become clogged
   with debris, such as rock chips, during drilling operations, potentially preventing
   the drilling fluid from effectively removing      debris and cooling the cutting
   surfaces.   Additionally, vacuum ports may become clogged or may lose suction
 5 during drilling.   For example, there may be insufficient annulus present in a
   borehole to maintain adequate air flow for removing debris from the cutting area,
   which may prevent outside air from effectively reaching the vacuum ports. Such
   problems may cause the drill bits to become worn and damaged due to a lack of
   adequate cooling and material removal, causing delays in drilling operations.
10 Avoiding such delays may reduce unnecessary downtime and production losses,
   which may be particularly important during bolting operations in mine tunnels
   due to various safety hazards present in these environments.
                                       SUMMARY
          Aspects of the present invention are described herein and in Australian
15 specification <removed-apn>, from which the present specification is divided, and in
   Australian   specification  2011261236,     from which    <removed-apn>     is  divided.
   Reference may be made in the description to subject matter which is not in the
   scope of the appended claims but relates to subject matter claimed in the parent
   specification, and/or grandparent application.      That subject matter should be
20 readily identifiable by a person skilled in the art and may assist putting into
   practice the invention as defined in the appended claims.
          The instant disclosure is directed to exemplary roof-bolt drill bits. In some
   examples, a roof-bolt drill bit may comprise a bit body that is rotatable about a
   central axis and that comprises a forward end and a rearward end axially opposite
25 the forward end.    The bit body may comprise an internal passage defined within
                                             3

   the bit body that extends to at least one side opening defined in a side portion of
   the bit body. In some examples, the internal passage may extend from an opening
   in the rearward end of the bit body.
           The bit body may also comprise at least one channel defined in a peripheral
 5 portion of the bit body that extends along a path between the rearward end of the
   bit body and a side portion of the bit body. In some examples, the at least one
   channel may slope away from the rearward end of the drill bit in a direction
   generally opposite the rotational direction. In various examples, the at least one
   channel may extend along a generally helical path and/or along a generally axial
10 path. In at least one example, the internal passage defined in the bit body may
   extend from an opening defined adjacent a forward end of the at least one
   channel.    The drill bit may additionally comprise at least one cutting element
   coupled to the bit body. Each cutting element may comprise a cutting face and a
   cutting edge adjacent the cutting face.       In various examples, the at least one
15 cutting element may comprise a superabrasive material (such as polycrystalline
   diamond) bonded to a substrate.        In at least one example, the bit body may
   comprise at least one flow path defined in a portion of the bit body located
   radially outward relative to the internal passage, the at least one flow path being
   configured to direct a fluid in a direction toward the forward end of the bit body.
20         In one example, the bit body may comprise a peripheral side surface
   located at a peripheral radial distance relative to the central axis and the at least
   one channel may be defined radially inward from the peripheral radial distance.
   Further, the drill bit may be configured to rotate about the central axis in a
   rotational direction during drilling and the at least one channel may be configured
25 to direct a fluid from the rearward end toward the forward end of the bit body
                                              4

   during drilling.    In at least one example, the internal passage may comprise a
   vacuum hole configured to draw debris away from the at least one cutting
   element.    The bit body may also comprise at least one debris channel defined in
   the bit body adjacent the at least one cutting element that extends between the
 5 forward end of the bit body and the side opening.
           In some embodiments, a roof-bolt drill bit may comprise a bit body having
   an internal passage defined within the bit body. The internal passage may extend
   from a rearward opening defined in the rearward end of the bit body through at
   least a portion of the bit body. In some examples, the bit body may also comprise
10 a central passage defined within the bit body that extends from the internal
   passage to a forward opening defined in a forward portion of the bit body. The bit
   body may further comprise at least one side passage defined within a portion of
   the bit body radially offset from the internal passage and/or the central axis. The
   at least one side passage may extend from the internal passage to a side opening
15 defined in a side portion of the bit body.       The side opening may be formed
   adjacent the at least one cutting element.
           In at least one example, the side passage may be configured to direct the
   fluid from the side opening at an angle of from 15' to 1800 from a forward
   direction parallel to the central axis.   In addition, at least one channel may be
20 defined in a peripheral portion of the bit body to extend along a path between a
   side portion of the bit body adjacent the at least one cutting element and the
   rearward end of the bit body. The side opening may be configured to direct the
   fluid toward the at least one channel and/or across the cutting face of the at least
   one cutting element.
                                              5

           In some examples, the at least one side passage may comprise a first
   section extending from the internal passage and a second section extending from
   the first section to the side opening in a nonparallel direction relative to the
   central axis. In at least one example, a central passage may be defined within the
 5 bit body, the central passage extending from the internal passage to a forward
   opening defined in a forward portion of the bit body.        The central passage may
   have a larger diameter than the at least one side passage. In one example, the bit
   body may comprise at least one bit blade located on a forward portion of the bit
   body and the at least one cutting element may be mounted to the at least one bit
10 blade.
           An exemplary roof-bolt drilling apparatus is also disclosed.     This drilling
   apparatus may comprise a drill steel that is rotatable about a central axis and a bit
   body coupled to the drill steel and rotatable about the central axis.    The bit body
   may comprise an internal passage defined within the bit body and at least one
15 flow path defined in a portion of the bit body located radially outward relative to
   the internal passage.    The at least one flow path may be configured to direct a
   fluid in a nonparallel direction relative to the central axis.

   combination with one another in accordance with the general principles described
20 herein. These and other embodiments, features, and advantages will be more fully
   understood upon reading the following detailed description in conjunction with

           Throughout the drawings, identical reference characters and descriptions
   indicate similar, but not necessarily identical, elements.      While the exemplary
 5 embodiments      described herein are susceptible to various      modifications    and
   alternative forms, specific embodiments have been shown by way of example in
   the drawings and will be described in detail herein.        However, the exemplary
   embodiments described herein are not intended to be limited to the particular
   forms    disclosed.    Rather,  the instant   disclosure   covers all  modifications,
10 equivalents, and alternatives falling within the scope of the appended claims.
          DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS
           The instant disclosure is directed to exemplary rotary drill bits for drilling
   formations    in various environments,     including wet-drilling   and dry-drilling
15 environments.     For example, a rotary drill bit may be coupled to a drill steel and
   rotated by a rotary drilling apparatus configured to rotate the rotary drill bit
   relative to a subterranean formation.    The phrase "wet-drilling environment," as
   used herein, may refer to drilling operations where drilling mud, water, and/or
   other drilling lubricants are supplied to a drill bit during cutting or drilling
20 operation. In contrast, the phrase "dry-drilling environment," as used herein, may
   refer to drilling operations that do not utilize drilling mud or other liquid
   lubricants during cutting or drilling operations.        For ease of use, the word
   "cutting," as used in this specification and claims, may refer broadly to machining
                                              8

   processes, drilling processes, boring processes, or any other material removal
   process.
          FIG. 1 is a partial cut-away perspective view of an exemplary drill bit 20
   according to at least one embodiment. Drill bit 20 may represent any type or form
 5 of earth-boring or drilling tool, including, for example, a rotary borehole drill bit.
   Drill bit 20 may be formed of any material or combination of materials, such as
   steel or molded tungsten carbide, without limitation.
          As illustrated FIG. 1, drill bit 20 may comprise a bit body 22 having a
   forward end 24 and a rearward end 26.        At least one cutting element 28 may be
10 coupled to bit body 22.    For example, as shown in FIG. 1, a plurality of cutting
   elements 28 may be coupled to forward end 24 of bit body 22. Cutting elements
   28 may be coupled to bit body 22 using any suitable technique, including, for
   example, brazing or welding.       According to some examples, back surfaces of
   cutting elements 28 (such as back surface 44 shown in FIG. 2) may be mounted
15 and secured to mounting surfaces on bit body 22, such as mounting surface 31
   shown in FIG. 1. Additionally, each cutting element 28 may be positioned on bit
   body 22 adjacent to and/or abutting a support member 33.        As illustrated in FIG.
   1, support member 33 may comprise a projection extending away from mounting
   surface 31.   Support member 33 may counteract various forces applied to cutting
20 element 28 during drilling, including forces acting on cutting element 28 in a
   generally rearward direction, thereby preventing a separation of cutting element
   28 from bit body 22.
          In at least one embodiment, an internal passage 30 may be defined within
   bit body 22.   As illustrated in FIG. 1, in some embodiments internal passage 30
25 may extend from a rearward opening 21 defined in rearward end 26 of bit body 22
                                              9

   to at least one side opening 32 defined in a side portion of bit body 22. As shown
   in FIG. 1, a side opening 32 may be disposed adjacent a cutting element 28. Side
   openings 32 may also be disposed axially rearward of cutting elements 28 (i.e.,
   between cutting elements 28 and rearward end 26 of bit body 22).            In one
 5 example, internal passage 30 may be configured to draw debris, such as rock
   cuttings, away from cutting elements 28. For example, a vacuum source may be
   attached to rearward opening 21 of internal passage 30 to draw cutting debris
   away from cutting elements 28 and through side opening 32 into internal passage
   30.
10         In some embodiments, bit body 22 may have a peripheral side surface 35
   defining an outer periphery of bit body 20.       In some examples, peripheral side
   surface 35 may comprise a generally cylindrical shape. Peripheral side surface 35
   may    also comprise    any other    suitable shape and/or configuration,   without
   limitation. As will be illustrated in greater detail below in connection with FIG.
15 3, peripheral side surface 35 may extend to a radial distance that is less than or
   approximately the same as outer edge portions (e.g., portions of chamfers 42
   illustrated in FIG. 3) of cutting elements 28. Accordingly, peripheral side surface
   35 may inhibit debris from falling around an outer portion of bit body 22 during
   drilling, thereby directing debris through side openings 32.
20         Bit body 22 may also comprise at least one peripheral channel 34 defined
   in a peripheral portion of bit body 22.         For example, as shown in FIG. 1,
   peripheral channels 34 may be formed in peripheral portions of bit body 22
   adjacent peripheral side surface 35.     Peripheral channels 34 may extend between
   rearward end 26 and forward end 24 and/or a side portion of bit body 22.
25 Peripheral channels 34 may comprise any suitable shape and configuration.       For
                                              10

   example, peripheral channels 34 may each comprise a helical groove extending
   around bit body 22 in a generally helical path.       As will be described in greater
   detail below in connection with FIG. 5, peripheral channels 34 may be configured
   to direct a fluid (e.g., a liquid and/or a gas), such as air, from rearward end 26
 5 toward forward end 24 of bit body 22 during drilling.
          At least one forward debris path 36 may be defined in bit body 22 to guide
   debris, such as rock cuttings, into internal passage 30.      Forward debris path 36
   may be formed in a variety of shapes and sizes, such as the substantially concave
   shape illustrated in FIG. 1.      In one example, forward debris path 36 may be
10 disposed adjacent at least one of cutting elements 28 and may extend generally
   between forward end 24 of bit body 22 and side opening 32.
          In some embodiments, bit body 22 may comprise an inward sloping surface
   38 extending between a forward portion of helical channel 34 and side opening
   32. Inward sloping surface 38 may also extend inward from a side portion of bit
15 body 22, such as peripheral channel 34.          According to at least one example,
   during use of drill bit 20, air directed through peripheral channel 34 may be drawn
   across inward sloping surface 38 toward internal passage 30 and/or forward debris
   path 36.
          FIG. 2 is a perspective view of an exemplary cutting element 28 that may
20 be coupled to exemplary bit body 22 in FIG. 1. As illustrated in FIG. 2, cutting
   element 28 may comprise a layer or table 39 affixed to or formed upon a substrate
   37. Table 39 may be formed of any material or combination of materials suitable
   for cutting subterranean formations,        including, for example, a superhard or
   superabrasive   material   such as polycrystalline     diamond (PCD).      The word
25 "superhard," as used herein, may refer to any material having a hardness that is at
                                               11

   least equal to a hardness of tungsten carbide.          Similarly, substrate 37 may
   comprise    any material    or combination    of materials    capable  of adequately
   supporting a superabrasive material during drilling of a subterranean formation,
   including, for example, cemented tungsten carbide.
 5         For example, cutting element 28 may comprise a table 39 comprising
   polycrystalline diamond bonded to a substrate 37 comprising cobalt-cemented
   tungsten carbide.    In at least one embodiment, after forming table 39, a catalyst
   material (e.g., cobalt or nickel) may be at least partially removed from table 39.
   A catalyst material may be removed from table 39 using any suitable technique,
10 such as, for example, acid leaching. In some examples, table 39 may be exposed
   to a leaching solution until a catalyst material is substantially removed from table
   39 to a desired depth relative to one or more surfaces of table 39.
           In at least one embodiment, substrate 37 may be at least partially covered
   with a protective layer, such as, for example, a polymer cup, to prevent corrosion
15 of substrate 37 during leaching.      In additional embodiments, table 39 may be
   separated from substrate 37 prior to leaching table 39. For example, table 39 may
   be removed from substrate 37 and placed in a leaching solution so that all
   surfaces of table 39 are at least partially leached.   In various examples, table 39
   may be reattached to substrate 37 or attached to a new substrate 37 following
20 leaching.   Table 39 may be attached to substrate 37 using any suitable technique,
   such as, for example, brazing, welding, or HPHT processing.
           As shown in FIG. 2, cutting element 28 may also comprise a cutting face
   40 formed by table 39, a side surface 46 formed by table 39 and substrate 37, and
   a back surface 44 formed by substrate 37.       According to various embodiments,
25 cutting face 40 may be substantially planar and side surface 46 may be
                                             12

   substantially perpendicular to cutting face 40.    Back surface 44 may be opposite
   and, in some embodiments, substantially parallel to cutting face 40.
           Cutting face 40 and side surface 46 may be formed in any suitable shape,
   without limitation.     In one example, cutting face 40 may have a substantially
 5 arcuate periphery.    In another example, cutting face 40 may have a substantially
   semi-circular periphery. For example, two cutting elements 28 may be cut from a
   single substantially circular cutting element blank, resulting in two substantially
   semi-circular cutting elements 28.      In some examples, angular portions of side
   surface 46 may be rounded to form a substantially arcuate surface around cutting
10 element 28.
           As illustrated in FIG. 2, cutting element 28 may also comprise a chamfer
   42 formed along at least a portion of a periphery of table 39 between cutting face
   40 and side surface 46. In some embodiments, and as illustrated FIG. 2, table 39
   may include a chamfer 42. Table 39 may also include any other suitable surface
15 shape between cutting face 40 and side surface 46, including, without limitation,
   an arcuate surface, a sharp edge, and/or a honed edge.         Chamfer 42 may be
   configured to contact and/or cut a subterranean formation as drill bit 20 is rotated
   relative to the formation (as will be described in greater detail below in
   connection with FIG. 5).     In at least one embodiment, the phrase "cutting edge"
20 may refer to an edge portion of cutting element 28 that is exposed to and/or in
   contact with a formation during drilling.     In some examples, cutting element 28
   may comprise one or more cutting edges, such as an edge 41 and/or or an edge 43.
   Edge 41     and/or edge 43 may be formed adjacent chamfer 42 and may be
   configured to be exposed to and/or in contact with a formation during drilling.
                                              13

           FIG. 3 is a side view and FIG. 4 is a top view of the exemplary drill bit 20
   illustrated in FIG. 1. As illustrated in FIGS. 3 and 4, drill bit 20 may be centered
   around and/or may be rotatable about a central axis 48.         Central axis 48 may
   extend in a lengthwise direction through drill bit 20 between forward end 24 and
 5 rearward end 26.
           In some embodiments, cutting elements 28 may be substantially centered
   and/or uniformly spaced about central axis 48. For example, as illustrated in FIG.
   4, two cutting elements 28 may be oppositely oriented about central axis 48. In at
   least one example, the two cutting elements 28 may be positioned approximately
10  1800 apart from each other relative to central axis 48.       Additionally, each of
   cutting elements 28 may be positioned on drill bit 20 at substantially the same
   back-rake and/or side-rake angle with respect to central axis 48.
           As illustrated in FIG. 3, peripheral side surface 35 may be located at a
   radial distance    R relative to central axis 48.      Radial distance R may be
15 substantially the same as the radial distance to which a portion of cutting elements
   28 (such as chamfers 42) extend.      Accordingly, peripheral side surface 35 may
   inhibit debris from moving past an outer portion of bit body 22 during drilling. In
   various examples, portions of cutting elements 28 (such as cutting edges 42) may
   extend radially beyond peripheral side surface 35.
20         FIG. 5 is a perspective view of a portion of an exemplary drilling apparatus
   50 comprising the drill bit 20 illustrated in FIG. 1 coupled to a drill steel 51.
   FIG. 5 illustrates flow patterns of a fluid, such as air, during a drilling operation
   in which a vacuum is applied to a drilling area via internal passage 30 defined in
   bit body 22. As shown in FIG. 5, rearward end 26 of drill bit 20 may be coupled
25 to drill steel 51 (e.g., by threaded connection, pin connection, and/or other
                                             14

   suitable coupling).    Drill steel 51 may comprise any suitable type of drill rod
   configured to connect drill bit 20 to a drilling apparatus, without limitation.    In
   some examples, drill steel 51 may comprise a substantially elongated and/or
   cylindrical shaft having coupling surfaces corresponding to surfaces defined
 5 within drill bit 20. For example, drill steel 51 may comprise a hexagonal and/or
   threaded periphery corresponding to a hexagonal and/or threaded interior surface
   defined within drill bit 20.   In some examples, drill steel 51 may comprise a pin
   connector corresponding to a pin hole and/or a recess defined within drill bit 20.
           According to at least one embodiment, force may be applied by a drilling
10 motor to drill bit 20 via drill steel 51, causing drill bit 20 to be forced against a
   subterranean formation in both a rotational direction 52 and a forward direction
   53.   As illustrated in FIG. 5, cutting faces 40 on cutting elements 28 may face
   generally in rotational direction 52 and may be angled with respect to rotational
   direction 52.    As drill bit 20 is forced against a subterranean formation and
15 rotated in rotational direction 52, cutting faces 40 and/or chamfers 42 of cutting
   elements 28 may contact and cut into the formation, removing rock material from
   the formation in the form of rock cuttings and/or other debris.         The cuttings
   removed by cutting elements 28 may be drawn through internal passage 30 by a
   vacuum applied to drill bit 20.
20         According to at least one embodiment, drilling apparatus 50 may be used to
   drill a borehole in an overhead surface structure, such as a mine roof. In such an
   embodiment, drill bit 20 may be axially oriented in a substantially vertical
   direction so that the forward end 24 of drill bit 20 faces toward a ceiling/wall
   (e.g., direction 53) of a coal mine. As material is removed from the structure by
25 cutting elements 28, at least some of the resulting debris may pass through side
                                             15

   opening 32 into internal passage 30. For example, debris may be drawn through
   side opening 32 into internal passage 30 by a vacuum applied to the drill bit 20.
   According to some embodiments, drill steel 51 may comprise a hollow rod and a
   vacuum may be applied to a rearward end of drill steel 51 by a vacuum source.
 5 Cutting debris may be drawn by the vacuum through drill bit 20 and drill steel 51
   toward the vacuum source.      Forward debris path 36 may facilitate movement of
   debris from cutting elements 28 and/or forward end 34 of drill bit 20 toward
   internal passage 30 in drill bit 20.
           Peripheral channel 34 may be sized and configured to direct and/or draw a
10 fluid, such as air or another suitable drilling fluid, from rearward end 26 toward
   forward end 24 of drill bit 20.     As shown in FIG. 5, peripheral channel 34 may
   comprise a groove extending along a generally helical path between rearward end
   26 and a side portion of drill bit 20. Peripheral channel 34 may also comprise any
   other suitable shape or configuration for drawing a fluid from rearward end 26
15 toward forward end 24, without limitation.      For example, peripheral channel 34
   may comprise a groove extending along bit body 20 generally in direction 53
   between rearward end 26 and a side portion of drill bit 20.         In at least one
   example, peripheral channel 34 may be defined radially inward from peripheral
   side surface 35.    For example, peripheral side surface 35 may be formed at a
20 peripheral radial distance relative to central axis 48 and surfaces        defining
   peripheral channel 24 may be located radially inward from the peripheral radial
   distance.
           During drilling of a borehole, peripheral side surface 35 may be located
   adjacent a wall surface of the borehole. Because peripheral channel 34 is defined
25 radially inward from peripheral side surface 35, a larger gap may be formed
                                             16

   between a surface of peripheral channel 24 and a borehole surface than is formed
   between peripheral side surface 35 and the borehole surface.          The gap between
   peripheral channel 34 and the borehole surface may provide an effective flow path
   for air or other drilling fluids during drilling. In some examples, the rotation of
 5 drill bit 20 in rotational direction 52 and/or the vacuum applied to drill bit 20 via
   internal passage 30 may force a significant portion of air through peripheral
   channel 34 in a helical direction 54 toward forward end 24 of drill bit 20.
           According to at least one embodiment, peripheral channel 34 may slope
   away from rearward end 26 of drill bit 20 in a direction generally opposite
10 rotational direction 52. For example, as illustrated in FIG. 5, peripheral channel
   34 may slope generally in helical direction 54 toward                forward end 24.
   Accordingly, as drill bit 20 rotates in rotational direction 52, air may be drawn up
   through peripheral channel 34 in helical direction 54 toward forward end 24 by a
   vacuum applied to internal passage 30 and air may be forced up through
15 peripheral channel 34 by the rotation of drill bit 20.In some examples, a
   peripheral channel may also be formed in a peripheral portion of drill steel 51.
   For example, as shown in FIG. 5, a peripheral channel 59 corresponding to
   peripheral channel 34 may be defined in a peripheral portion of drill steel 51.       A
   forward portion of peripheral channel 59 may be aligned with a rearward portion
20 of peripheral channel 34 when drill bit 20 is coupled to drill steel 51.
   Accordingly, as drill steel 51 and drill bit 20 are rotated in rotational direction 52,
   air may be forced and/or drawn up through peripheral channel 59 formed in drill
   steel 51 toward peripheral channel 34 formed in drill bit 20.           In at least one
   example, peripheral channel 59 may comprise a generally helical channel.
                                             17

           In some embodiments, peripheral channel 34 defined in bit body 22 may
   terminate at a portion of bit body 22 adjacent at least one of cutting elements 28.
   In at least one example, the forward end of peripheral channel 34 may terminate
   at inward sloping surface 38 near forward end 24 of drill bit 20.         Air from
 5 peripheral channel 34 may flow over inward sloping surface 38 toward side
   opening 32 and/or forward debris path 36.     For example, air may exit peripheral
   channel 34 in general direction 56. Air and cutting debris may then be drawn into
   internal passage 30 by a vacuum applied to internal passage 30. For example, air
   may be drawn over cutting elements 28 toward internal passage 30 in general
10 direction 58.  Air and cutting debris may also be drawn into internal passage 30
   from other directions.    For example, air and cutting debris may be drawn into
   internal passage 30 from cutting elements 28, forward debris path 36, and/or
   inward sloping surface 38.
           In some examples, peripheral channel 34 formed in bit body 22 of drill bit
15 20 may extend along only a portion of bit body 22 between rearward end 26 and
   forward end 24 and/or a side portion of bit body 22.      For example, bit body 22
   may comprise a section disposed axially rearward of peripheral side surface 35
   that is narrower than peripheral side surface 35.         In such an embodiment,
   peripheral channel 34 may only extend between the section disposed axially
20 rearward of peripheral side surface 35 and forward end 24 and/or a side portion of
   bit body 22.
           The shape, position, and/or orientation of peripheral channel 34 may be
   selected so as to increase the effectiveness of drill bit 20 in cooling portions of
   cutting elements 28 and/or portions of bit body 22 during drilling.      The shape,
25 position, and/or orientation of peripheral channel 34 may also be selected so as to
                                             18

   increase the effectiveness of drill bit 20 in removing material from an area around
   a forward portion of drill bit 20 during drilling.           According to various
   embodiments, peripheral channel 34 may facilitate air flow created by a vacuum
   applied to internal passage 30 by increasing the flow of air or other fluid to a
 5 forward portion of drill bit 20.
          FIGS. 6-9 illustrate an exemplary drill bit 120 according to at least one
   embodiment. FIG. 6 is a partial cut-away perspective view of an exemplary drill
   bit 120 and FIG. 7 is a top view of the exemplary drill bit 120. Drill bit 120 may
   represent any type or form of earth-boring or drilling tool, including, for example,
10 a rotary borehole drill bit.
          As illustrated in FIGS. 6 and 7, drill bit 120 may comprise a bit body 122
   having a forward end 124 and a rearward end 126. At least one cutting element
   128 may be coupled to bit body 122. Back surfaces 144 of cutting elements 128
   may be mounted and secured to mounting surfaces 131.           Cutting elements 128
15 may comprise a cutting face 140, a side surface 146, a back surface 144, and a
   chamfer 142 formed along an intersection between cutting face 140 and side
   surface 146.   Drill bit 120 may also comprise a main body 160 and at least one
   cutting element support structure 162 extending radially outward and/or offset
   from main body 160 (as will be described in greater detail below in connection
20 with FIG. 9).    In some examples, drill bit 120 may not include cutting element
   support structures 162 extending radially outward from main body 160. Cutting
   elements 128 may be mounted to bit body 122 so that portions of cutting elements
   128 abut support members 133.
          Bit body 122 may also comprise at least one forward opening 164 and/or at
25 least one side opening 166. As illustrated in FIGS. 6 and 7, forward opening 164
                                              19

   may be defined in bit body 22 adjacent forward end 124 of bit body 122 and side
   openings 166 may be defined in bit body 22 adjacent cutting elements 128.
   Additionally, a rearward opening 121 may be defined in rearward end 126 of bit
   body 122. According to at least one embodiment, drill bit 120 may be configured
 5 such that a drilling fluid may flow through rearward opening 121 to forward
   opening 164 and/or side openings 166.
          FIG. 8 is a partial cross-sectional perspective view of a drill bit 120
   according to certain embodiments. As shown in FIG. 8, bit body 122 may include
   various fluid passages extending between rearward opening 121 and forward
10 opening 164 and/or side openings 166. For example, an internal passage 170 may
   be defined within bit body 122. Internal passage 170 may extend from rearward
   opening 121 to a portion of bit body 122 where two or more passages are defined.
   For example, internal passage 170 may extend to an internal surface 178 defined
   within bit body 122. According to some embodiments, internal surface 178 may
15 comprise a tapered surface extending between internal passage 170 and a central
   passage 174 defined within bit body 122. Internal surface 178 may also comprise
   a generally flat, concave, and/or any other suitable surface shape, without
   limitation.  Central passage 174 may extend between internal surface 178 and
   forward opening 164.     In some examples, central passage 174 may extend in a
20 direction substantially parallel to central axis 148.  In at least one example,
   central passage 174 may extend in a nonparallel direction relative to central axis
   148.
          At least one side passage 176 may also be defined within bit body 122. In
   at least one example, one or more of side passages 176 may extend from central
25 passage 174.     In some embodiments, central passage 174 may have a larger
                                           20

   diameter than the at least one side passage 176.       The at least one side passages
   176 may extend between internal surface 178 and side opening 166 and may be
   radially offset from central passage 174. In some examples, the at least one side
   passage 176 may include a first section 175 and a second section 177.             First
 5 section 175 may extend from internal surface 178, internal passage 172, and/or
   central passage 174 and second section 177 may extend between first section 175
   and side opening 166.
           In at least one example, first section 175 may extend in a direction
   substantially parallel to central axis 148.   First section 175 may also extend in a
10 nonparallel direction relative to central axis 148.       In some examples, second
   section 177 may extend in a nonparallel direction relative to central axis 148. For
   example,   second section    177 may include       a curved    and/or angled portion
   configured to direct a fluid from first section 175 through side opening 166 in a
   nonparallel direction relative to central axis 148. In various embodiments, second
15 section 177 may be configured to direct a fluid from side opening 166 at an angle
   of from 15' to 1800 from a forward direction parallel to central axis 148.
           FIG. 9 is a side view of a portion of the exemplary drill bit 120 illustrated
   in FIG. 6. FIG. 9 illustrates flow patterns of a drilling fluid (such as drilling mud
   and/or air) during a drilling operation in which the drilling fluid is directed under
20 pressure through rearward opening 121 toward a forward portion of drill bit 120.
   As shown in FIG. 9, a drilling fluid may be directed from forward opening 164
   generally in direction 180 and/or from at least one side opening 166 generally in
   direction 182. Direction 180 may be substantially parallel to central axis 148 and
   direction 182 may be nonparallel relative to central axis 148.       The drilling fluid
25 exiting forward opening 164 and/or side openings 166 may flow over portions of
                                             21

   cutting elements 128, such as portions of cutting faces 140 and/or chamfers 142.
   Additionally, the drilling fluid exiting forward opening 164 and/or side openings
    166 may contact portions of a borehole that is being drilled by drill bit 120.       As
   the drilling fluid contacts portions of the borehole and/or cutting elements 128,
 5 the drilling fluid may carry away rock cuttings and/or other debris generated
   during drilling. The size, shape, number, and/or directional orientation of forward
   opening 164 and/or side openings 166 may be selected so as to increase the
   effectiveness of drill bit 120 in cooling portions of cutting elements 128 and/or to
   increase the effectiveness of drill bit 120 in removing material from a cutting area
10 near forward end 124 of drill bit 120.
           As additionally illustrated in FIG. 9, main body 160 of bit body 122 may
   extend to a first radial distance Ri relative to central axis 148. Additionally, the
   at least one cutting element support structure 162 may extend to a second radial
   distance R 2 that is greater than first radial distance R 1 relative to central axis 148.
15 At least one cutting element 128 may be mounted to the at least one cutting
   element support structure 162 and at least a portion of the at least one cutting
   element 128, such as chamfer 142, may extend to a greater radial distance than
   first radial distance R 1 relative to central axis 148.
           Because cutting element support structures 162 and/or cutting elements 128
20 extend to greater radial distances than main body 160, a space may be formed
   between a borehole being drilled by drill bit 120 and an outer peripheral surface
   of main body 160.     Drilling fluid expelled from forward opening 164 and/or side
   openings 166 may carry cutting debris over cutting elements 128 and/or through
   forward debris path 136 and over main body 160 of bit body 122 through the
25 space formed between the borehole and main body 160.            A portion of main body
                                               22

    160 located between cutting element support structures 162 may permit drilling
   fluid and/or cutting debris to pass between cutting element support structures 162
   toward rearward end 126.      In some embodiments, channels may be formed in a
   peripheral portion of bit body 122 to direct the flow of material away from cutting
 5 elements 128 along a specified path (as will be described in greater detail below
   in connection with FIG. 10).
           According to various embodiments, central passage 174 may have a larger
   diameter than side passages 176.      For example, as illustrated in FIG. 8, central
   passage 174 may have a diameter Di that is larger than diameters D 2 of side
10 passages 176.    During a drilling operation, a drilling fluid may be forced under
   pressure through central passage 174 and/or side passages 176.       Because central
   passage 174 has a larger diameter than side passages 176, a greater volume of
   drilling fluid may pass through central passage 174 when central passage 174 is
   unobstructed.    However, central passage 174 may become at least partially
15 blocked by cutting debris during drilling.
           For example, cutting debris, such as a rock chip separated from a rock
   formation being drilled, may become lodged within at least a portion of forward
   opening 136 and/or central passage 174, limiting the flow of drilling fluid through
   central passage 174.    When central passage 174 becomes blocked by debris, the
20 fluid pressure in bit body 122 may be increased and a greater volume of drilling
   fluid may be forced through side passages 176 in a nonparallel direction.
           FIG. 10 is a perspective view of an exemplary drill bit 220 according to at
   least one embodiment.     As illustrated FIG. 10, drill bit 220 may comprise a bit
   body 222 having a forward end 224 and a rearward end 226. At least one cutting
25 element 228 may be mounted and secured to bit body 222.        Cutting elements 228
                                             23

   may comprise a cutting face 240, a side surface 246, and a chamfer 242 formed
   along an intersection between cutting face 240 and side surface 246.       Cutting
   elements 228 may be mounted to bit body 222 so that portions of cutting elements
   228 abut support members 233.      Bit body 222 may also have a peripheral side
 5 surface 235 defining an outer periphery of drill bit 220.
          A forward opening 264 and at least one side opening 266 may be defined in
   bit body 222.    In some embodiments, a drilling fluid (such as air and/or drilling
   mud) may be directed from a rearward opening 221 defined in rearward end 226
   to forward opening 264 and/or side openings 266. For example, passages may be
10 defined within bit body 222 (e.g., internal passage 170, central passage 174,
   and/or side passages 176) for directing the drilling fluid between rearward
   opening 221 and forward opening 264 and/or side openings 266.
          According to at least one embodiment, a peripheral channel 284 may be
   defined in an exterior portion of bit body 222.    For example, peripheral channel
15 284 may be defined radially inward from peripheral side surface 235 of bit body
   222.  As illustrated in FIG. 10, peripheral channel 284 may extend from an area
   adjacent at least one cutting element 228 to rearward end 226 of bit body 222.
   Peripheral channel 284 may be formed to any shape and/or configuration suitable
   for channeling a fluid, such as a drilling fluid.  For example, peripheral channel
20 284 may comprise a groove extending along a generally helical path between a
   portion of bit body 222 adjacent cutting element 228 and rearward end 226.
   Peripheral  channel   284   may   also   comprise   any   other suitable shape    or
   configuration for drawing a fluid away from forward end 224 and toward rearward
   end 226, without limitation.
                                            24

           According to various embodiments, a fluid, such as a drilling fluid expelled
   from forward opening 264 and/or side openings 266, may be directed toward
   peripheral channel 284. The drilling fluid directed toward peripheral channel 284
   may carry cutting debris generated during drilling. In at least one embodiment, a
 5 drilling fluid may be directed by at least one opening, such as side opening 266,
   toward peripheral channel 284 generally in direction 285.          For example, as
   illustrated in FIG. 10, drilling fluid expelled from side opening 266 may be
   directed across cutting element 228 toward peripheral channel 284 generally in
   direction 286.
10         The drilling fluid may then be directed through peripheral channel 284
   generally in direction 288. For example, the drilling fluid may be directed in a
   generally helical path along peripheral channel 284.     In some embodiments, the
   flow of the drilling fluid through peripheral channel 284 may be facilitated as
   drill bit 220 is rotated in a rotational direction 252. For example, the rotation of
15 drill bit 220 in rotational direction 252 and the force of the water expelled from
   side ports 266 and/or 264 may cause the drilling fluid to travel through peripheral
   channel 284 toward rearward end 226 of drill bit 20. In at least one embodiment,
   travel of the fluid through peripheral channel 284 may be facilitated by gravity as
   the fluid is gravitationally pulled toward rearward end 226.
20         FIGS. 11 and 12 illustrate an exemplary drill bit 320 according to at least
   one embodiment.       FIG. 11 is a perspective view of exemplary drill bit 320 and
   FIG. 12 is a top view of exemplary drill bit 320. As illustrated in FIG. 11, drill
   bit 320 may comprise a bit body 322 having a forward end 324 and a rearward end
   326. Bit body 322 may comprise a forward drilling portion 389 and a rearward
25 coupling portion 391.     Forward drilling portion 389 may have a peripheral side
                                              25

   surface 335 defining an outer periphery of drill bit 320.        In some examples,
   peripheral side surface 335 of forward drilling portion 389 may be located
   radially outward from an outer surface of rearward coupling portion 391.          As
   illustrated in FIG. 12, drill bit 320 may be centered around and/or may be
 5 rotatable about a central axis 348.   Central axis 348 may extend in a lengthwise
   direction through drill bit 320 between forward end 324 and rearward end 326.
           At least one cutting element 328 may be mounted and secured to forward
   drilling portion 389 of bit body 322.   Cutting elements 328 may each comprise a
   cutting face 340, a side surface 346, and a chamfer 342 formed along an
10 intersection between cutting face 340 and side surface 346. Cutting elements 328
   may be mounted to bit body 322 so that portions of cutting elements 328 abut
   support members 333 formed on forward drilling portion 389.
           One or more openings may be formed in forward drilling portion 389 of bit
   body 222. For example, as shown in FIGS. 11 and 12, openings 390A-390D may
15 be defined in forward drilling portion 389. In some embodiments, a drilling fluid
   (such as drilling mud, air, and/or any other suitable fluid) may be directed through
   one or more passages (e.g., internal passage 393 illustrated in FIG. 3) to openings
   390A-390D.      At least one of openings 390A-390D may be located adjacent at
   least one of cutting elements 328.
20         Rearward coupling portion 391 of bit body 222 may be shaped and/or
   configured to couple drill bit 320 to a drilling attachment, such as a reamer, bit
   seat, drill steel, and/or any other suitable attachment.     For example, rearward
   coupling portion 391 of drill bit 320 may be coupled to a reamer or a bit seat by a
   threaded connection, a pin connection, a spring connection, and/or any other
25 suitable coupling, without limitation. At least one channel 392 may be defined in
                                            26

   rearward coupling portion 391. As illustrated in FIG. 11, channel 392 may extend
   between rearward end 326 and forward drilling portion 389 of bit body 322.
   Channel 392 may be sized and configured to direct a fluid, such as air or another
   suitable drilling fluid, from rearward end 326 toward forward drilling portion 389
 5 of bit body 322.     For example, channel 392 may comprise a groove extending
   between rearward end 326 and forward drilling portion 389 of bit body 322.
           FIG. 13 is a side view of a portion of an exemplary drilling apparatus 350
   comprising the drill bit 320 illustrated in FIGS. 11 and 12 coupled to a drilling
   attachment 395 (e.g., a bit seat, a reamer, a drill steel, and/or other suitable
10 drilling attachment).    Drilling attachment 395 may be sized and configured to at
   least partially surround rearward coupling portion 391.    Drilling attachment 395
   may be coupled to rearward coupling portion 391 using any suitable connection
   (e.g., a threaded connection, a pin connection, a spring connection, and/or other
   suitable coupling). Drilling attachment 395 may at least partially surround and/or
15 cover channel 392 defined in rearward coupling portion 391, forming a passage
   between drilling attachment 395 and rearward coupling portion 391 that extends
   from rearward end 326 to forward drilling portion 389 of bit body 322.
           According to some examples, at least one internal passage 393 may be
   defined within forward drilling portion 389 of bit body 322.       For example, as
20 illustrated in FIG. 13, an internal passage 393 defined within forward drilling
   portion 389 may extend between an opening 397 defined in a rearward face of
   forward drilling portion 389 and one or more of openings 390A-390D.        In some
   examples, internal passage 393 may comprise a branched passage having one or
   more branches extending to openings 390A-390D.
                                             27

           As illustrated in FIG. 13, opening 397 may be located adjacent channel 392
   defined in rearward coupling portion 391.      Accordingly, drilling fluids may be
   directed between channel 392 defined in rearward coupling portion 391 and
   internal passage 393 defined in forward drilling portion 389.       In at least one
 5 example, drilling apparatus 350 may direct drilling fluids through a passage
   formed between channel 392 and an internal surface of drilling attachment 395 in
   general direction 396 (e.g., a generally forward and/or axial direction).        The
   drilling fluids may be directed from channel 392 into internal passage 393 through
   opening 397 defined in forward drilling portion 389. The drilling fluids may then
10 be forced through openings 390A-390D defined in forward drilling portion 389 in
   any suitable direction, such as general directions 394A-394D.         For example,
   drilling fluids may be directed through opening 390A in general direction 394A,
   which is generally parallel to central axis 348 shown in FIG. 12.    Drilling fluids
   may also be directed through openings 390B-390D in general directions 394B
15 394D, which are not parallel to central axis 348.
           A drilling fluid exiting openings 390A-390D may flow over portions of
   cutting elements 328, such as portions of cutting faces 340 and/or chamfers 342.
   Additionally, the drilling fluid exiting openings 390A-390D may contact portions
   of a borehole that is being drilled by drill bit 320. As the drilling fluid contacts
20 portions of the borehole and/or cutting elements 328, the drilling fluid may carry
   away rock cuttings and/or other debris generated during drilling. The size, shape,
   number, and/or directional orientation of openings 390A-390D may be selected so
   as to increase the effectiveness of drill bit 320 in cooling portions of cutting
   elements 328 and/or to increase the effectiveness of drill bit 320 in removing
25 material from a cutting area near forward end 324 of drill bit 320.
                                             28

          FIG. 14 is a side view of an exemplary drill bit 420 according to at least
   one embodiment. As illustrated in FIG. 14, drill bit 420 may comprise a bit body
   422 having a forward end 424 and a rearward end 426.            At least one cutting
   element 428 may be coupled to bit body 422. For example, a plurality of cutting
 5 elements 428 may be coupled to forward end 424 of bit body 422. According to
   some examples, back surfaces of cutting elements 428 may be mounted and
   secured to mounting surfaces on bit body 422, such as mounting surface 431
   shown in FIG. 14.     Additionally, each cutting element 428 may be positioned on
   bit body 422 adjacent to and/or abutting a support member 433.                In some
10 examples, bit body 422 may comprise a forward debris path 436 and an inward
   sloping surface 438.
          In at least one embodiment, an internal passage 430 may be defined within
   bit body 422.   As illustrated in FIG. 14, internal passage 430 may extend from a
   rearward opening 421 defined in rearward end 426 of bit body 422 to at least one
15 side opening 432 defined in a side portion of bit body 422.       Bit body 422 may
   have a peripheral side surface 435 defining an outer periphery of bit body 422.
   Bit body 422 may also comprise at least one peripheral channel 434 defined in a
   peripheral portion of bit body 422.      Peripheral channel 434 may comprise any
   suitable shape and configuration.    For example, as shown in FIG. 14, peripheral
20 channel 434 may comprise a groove extending along bit body 422 in a generally
   axial path.   Peripheral channel 434 may be configured to direct cutting debris
   and/or a fluid (e.g., a liquid and/or a gas), such as air and/or drilling fluid, along
   an outer portion of bit body 422.        For example, air may be directed along
   peripheral channel 434 from rearward end 426 toward forward end 424 of bit body
25 422 during drilling.
