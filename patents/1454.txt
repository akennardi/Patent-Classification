ABSTRACT
The present invention generally relates to treatment of iron-related conditions with iron
carbohydrate complexes. One aspect of the invention is a method of treatment of iron
related conditions with a single unit dosage of at least about 0.6 grams of elemental iron
via an iron carbohydrate complex. The method generally employs iron carbohydrate
complexes with nearly neutral pH, physiological osmolarity, and stable and non
immunogenic carbohydrate components so as to rapidly administer high single unit doses
of iron intravenously to patients in need thereof.

   FIELD OF THE INVENTION
            [0002]    The present invention generally relates to treatment of iron-related
   conditions with iron carbohydrate complexes.
   BACKGROUND
15          [0003]     Parenteral iron therapy is known to be effective in a variety of diseases
   and conditions including, but not limited to, severe iron deficiency, iron deficiency anemia,
   problems of intestinal iron absorption, intestinal iron intolerance, cases where regular
   intake of an oral iron preparation is not guaranteed, iron deficiency where there is no
   response to oral therapy (e.g., dialysis patients), and situations where iron stores are
20 scarcely or not at all formed but would be important for further therapy (e.g., in
   combination with erythropoietin). Geisser et al., Arzneimittelforschung (1992) 42(12),
   1439-1452. There exist various commercially available parenteral iron formulations. But
   many currently available parenteral iron drugs, while purportedly effective at repleting iron
   stores, have health risks and dosage limitations associated with their use.
25          [0004]     Currently available parenteral iron formulations approved for use in the
   U.S. include iron dextran (e.g., InFed, Dexferrum), sodium ferric gluconate complex in
   sucrose (Ferrlecit), and iron sucrose (Venofer). Although serious and life-threatening
   reactions occur most frequently with iron dextran, they are also known to occur with other
   parenteral iron products. In addition, non-life threatening reactions such as arthralgia,
30 back pain, hypotension, fever, myalgia, pruritus, vertigo, and vomiting also occur. These
   reactions, while not life-threatening, often preclude further dosing and therefore iron
   repletion.
            [0005]     Iron dextran, the first parenteral iron product available in the United
   States (US), has been associated with an incidence of anaphylactoid-type reactions (i.e.,
35 dyspnea, wheezing, chest pain, hypotension, urticaria, angioedema). See generally
   Fishbane, Am J Kidney Dis (2003) 41(5Suppl), 18-26; Landry et al. (2005) Am J Nephrol
   25, 400-410, 407. This high incidence of anaphylactoid reactions is believed to be caused
   by the formation of antibodies to the dextran moiety. Other parenteral iron products (e.g.,
   iron sucrose and iron gluconate) do not contain the dextran moiety, and the incidence of
40 anaphylaxis with these products is markedly lower. Fishbane, Am J Kidney Dis (2003)
   41(5Suppl), 18-26; Geisser et al., Arzneimittelforschung (1992) 42(12), 1439-52.
   However, the physical characteristics of, for
                                                   -1A-

  WO 2007/081744                                                            PCT/US2007/000176
     example, iron gluconate and iron sucrose lead to dosage and administration rate limitations.
     Negative characteristics include high pH, high osmolarity, low dosage limits (e.g., maximum 500
     mg iron once per week, not exceeding 7 mg iron/kg body weight), and the long duration of
     administration (e.g., 100 mg iron over at least 5 minutes as an injection; 500 mg iron over at least
 5 - 3.5 hours as a drip infusion). Furthermore, injectable high molecular mass substances produce
     more allergic reactions than the corresponding low molecular mass substances. Geisser et al.
     (1992) Arzneimittelforschung 42: 1439-1452.
               (0006] Ferumoxytol is a newer parenteral iron formulation but limited information is
     available as to its efficacy and administration. See e.g., Landry et al. (2005) Am J Nephrol 25,
10   400-410, 408; and Spinowitz et al. (2005) Kidney Intl 68, 1801-1807; U.S. Patent No. 6,599,498.
               [0007]     Various pharmacokinetic studies suggest that doses of iron complexes higher
     than 200 mg of iron are generally unsuitable and that the conventional therapy model prescribes
     repeated applications of lower doses over several days. See Geisser et al., (1992)
     Arzneimittelforschung 42: 1439-1452. For example, to achieve iron repletion under current
15   therapy models, a total dose of 1 g typically requires 5 to 10 sessions over an extended period of
     time. These delivery modes incur significant expense for supplies such as tubing and infusate,
     costly nursing time, multiple administrations, and patient inconvenience.
     SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
               (00O8]     Among the various aspects of the present invention is the provision of a
20   method of treatment of iron-associated diseases, disorders, or conditions with iron formulations.
     Briefly, therefore, the present invention is directed to use of iron carbohydrate complexes that
     can be administered parenterally at relatively high single unit dosages, thereby providing a safe
     and efficient means for delivery of a total dose of iron in fewer sessions over the course of
     therapeutic treatment.
25             [0oo93 The present teachings include methods of treating a disease, disorder, or
     condition characterized by iron deficiency or dysfunctional iron metabolism through the
     administration of at least 0.6 grams of elemental iron via a single unit dosage of an iron
     carbohydrate complex to a subject that is in need of such therapy.
               [0010] In various embodiments, the method treats anemia. In some embodiments,
30   the anemia is an iron deficiency anemia, such as that associated with chronic blood loss; acute
     blood loss; pregnancy; childbirth; childhood development; psychomotor and cognitive
     development in children; breath holding spells; heavy uterine bleeding; menstruation; chronic
     recurrent hemoptysis; idiopathic pulmonary siderosis; chronic internal bleeding; gastrointestinal
     bleeding; parasitic infections; chronic kidney disease; dialysis; surgery or acute trauma; and
35   chronic ingestion of alcohol, chronic ingestion of salicylates, chronic ingestion of steroids; chronic
     ingestion of non-steroidial anti-inflammatory agents, or chronic ingestion of erythropoiesis
                                                        -2-

 WO 2007/081744                                                           PCT/US2007/000176
    stimulating agents. In some aspects, the anemia is anemia of chronic disease, such as'
    rheumatoid arthritis; cancer; Hodgkins leukemia; non-Hodgkins leukemia; cancer chemotherapy;
    inflammatory bowel disease; ulcerative colitis thyroiditis; hepatitis; systemic lupus erythematosus;
    polymyalgia rheumatica; scleroderma; mixed connective tissue disease; Sojgren's syndrome;
 5  congestive heart failure I cardiomyopathy; or idiopathic geriatric anemia. In some embodiments,
    the anemia is due to impaired iron absorption or poor nutrition, such as anemia associated with~
    Crohn's Disease; gastric surgery; ingestion of drug products that inhibit iron absorption; and
    chronic use of calcium. In various embodiments, the method treats restless leg syndrome; blood
    donation; Parkinson's disease; hair loss; or attention deficit disorder.

     administered in about 15 minutes or less. In some embodiments, the single dosage unit of
20   elemental iron is administered in about 10 minutes or less, about 5 minutes or less, or about 2
     minutes or less.
               [00131 In various embodiments, the subject does not experience a significant adverse
     reaction to the single dosage unit administration.

      mean diameter particle size no greater than about 35 nm; a blood half-life of between about 10
      hours to about 20 hours; a substantially non-immunogenic carbohydrate component; and
      substantially no cross reactivity with anti-dextran antibodies.
               [o15) In various embodiments, the iron carbohydrate complex contains about 24% to
30    about 32% elemental iron; contains about 25% to about 50% carbohydrate; has a molecular
      weight of about 90,000 daltons to about 800,000 daltons, or some combination thereof.
              In various embodiments, the iron carbohydrate complex is an iron monosaccharide
      complex, an iron disaccharide complex, or an iron polysaccharide complex. In some
      embodiments, the iron carbohydrate complex is iron carboxymaltose complex, iron mannitol
35    complex, iron polyisomaltose complex, iron polymaltose complex, iron gluconate complex, iron
      sorbitol complex, or an iron hydrogenated dextran complex. In some embodiments, the iron

 5  from an aqueous solution of iron (111)  salt and an aqueous solution of the oxidation product of one
    or more maltodextrins using an aqueous hypochlorite solution at a pH value within the alkaline
    range, wherein, when one maltodextrin is applied, its dextrose equivalent lies between 5 and 20,
    and when a mixture of several maltodextrins is applied, the dextrose equivalent lies between 5
    and 20 and the dextrose equivalent of each individual maltodextrin contained in the mixture lies
10  between 2 and 20. In some preferred embodiments, the iron carboxymaltose complex has a
    chemical formula of [FeO, (OH)y (H2O),]n [{(C 6 HioO 5 )m(C6 H120 7 )}1 ]k, where n is about 103, m is
    about 8, I is about 11, and k is about 4; contains about 28% elemental iron; and has a molecular
    weight of about 150,000 Da. In some preferred embodiments, the iron carboxymaltose complex
     is polynuclear iron (II1)-hydroxide 4(R)-(poly-(1-*4)-O-a-glucopyranosyl)-oxy-2(R),3(S),5(R),6

               [0016]     In various embodiments, the iron carbohydrate complex comprises an iron
    core with a mean iron core size of no greater than about 9 nm. In some embodiments, the mean
     iron core size is at least about 1 nm but no greater than about 9 nm; at least about 3 nm but no
     greater than about 7 nm; or at least about 4 nm but not greater than about 5 nm.

               [0018]     In various embodiments, the iron carbohydrate complex is administered
     parenterally, for example intravenously or intramuscularly. In some embodiments, the iron
     carbohydrate complex is intravenously infused. In certain embodiments, the single unit dose of
     iron carbohydrate complex is intravenously infused at a concentration of about 1000 mg
30   elemental iron in about 200 ml to about 300 ml of diluent, for example, about 250 ml of diluent or
     about 215 ml of diluent. In some embodiments, the iron carbohydrate complex is intravenously
     injected as a bolus. In certain embodiments, the iron carbohydrate complex is intravenously
     injected as a bolus at a concentration of about 1000 mg elemental iron in about 200 ml to about
      300 ml of diluent, for example, about 250 ml of diluent or about 215 ml of diluent. In some

     4(R)-(poly-(1-4)-O-a-glucopyranosyl)-oxy-2(R),3(S),5(R),6-tetrahydroxy-hexanoate. In some
     these embodiments, the iron carboxymaltose complex is obtained from an aqueous solution of
20   iron (ll) salt and an aqueous solution of the oxidation product of one or more maltodextrins using
     an aqueous hypochlorite solution at a pH value within the alkaline range, wherein, when one
     maltodextrin is applied, its dextrose equivalent lies between about 5 and about 20, and when a

 5  DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
               [00261 The present invention makes use of iron carbohydrate complexes that can be
    administered parenterally at relatively high single unit dosages for the therapeutic treatment of a
    variety of iron-associated diseases, disorders, or conditions. Generally, states indicative of a
    need for therapy with high single unit dosages of iron carbohydrate complexes include, but are
10  not limited to iron deficiency anemia, anemia of chronic disease, and states characterized by
    dysfunctional iron metabolism. Efficacious treatment of these, and other, diseases and conditions

    S91-S92. The present invention is directed to use of iron carbohydrate complexes that can be
15  administered parenterally at relatively high single unit dosages, thereby providing a safe and
    efficient means for delivery of a total dose of iron in fewer sessions over the course of therapeutic
    treatment.

              [0031] Again, each of the above listed states, diseases, disorders, and conditions, as
    well as others, can benefit from the treatment methodologies described herein. Generally,
    treating a state, disease, disorder, or condition includes preventing or delaying the appearance of
    clinical symptoms in a mammal that may be afflicted with or predisposed to the state, disease,
 5  disorder, or condition but does not yet experience or display clinical or subclinical symptoms
    thereof. Treating can also include inhibiting the state, disease, disorder, or condition, e.g.,
     arresting or reducing the development of the disease or at least one clinical or subclinical
     symptom thereof. Furthermore, treating can include relieving the disease, e.g., causing
     regression of the state, disease, disorder, or condition or at least one of its clinical or subclinical
10   symptoms.
               [0032]      The benefit to a subject to be treated is either statistically significant or at least
     perceptible to the patient or to the physician. Measures of efficacy of iron replacement therapy
     are generally based on measurement of iron-related parameters In blood. The aim of treatment
     is usually to return both Hb and iron stores to normal levels. Thus, efficacy of iron replacement
15   therapy can be interpreted in terms of the ability to normalise Hb levels and iron stores. The
     effectiveness of treatment with one or more single unit doses of iron carbohydrate complex, as
     described herein, can be demonstrated, for example, by improvements in ferritin and transferrin
     saturation, and in raising hemoglobin levels in anemic patients. Iron stores can be assessed by
     interpreting serum ferritin levels. TfS is frequently used, in addition, to diagnose absolute or
20   functional iron deficiencies. In patients with iron deficiency, serum transferrin is elevated and will
     decrease following successful iron treatment.
               [0033]      Administration
               [0034)      Methods of treatment of various diseases, disorders, or conditions with iron
      complex compositions comprise the administration of the complex in single unit dosages of at
25    least 0.6 grams of elemental iron to about at least 2.5 grams of elemental iron. Administration of
     single unit dosages can be, for example, over pre-determined time intervals or in response to the
      appearance and/or reappearance of symptoms. For example, the iron carbohydrate complex
      can be re-administered upon recurrence of at least one symptom of the disease or disorder. As
      another example, the iron carbohydrate complex can be re-administered at some time period
30    after the initial administration (e.g., after 4 days to 12 months).
               [0035] Any route of delivery of the single unit dose of iron carbohydrate complex is
      acceptable so long as iron from the iron complex is released such that symptoms are treated.
      The single unit dose of iron carbohydrate complex can be administered parenterally, for example
      intravenously or intramuscularly. Intravenous administration can be delivered as a bolus or
35    preferably as an infusion. For example, the single unit dose of iron carbohydrate complex can be
      intravenously infused at a concentration of about 1000 mg elemental iron in about 200 ml to
      about 300 ml of diluent, preferably about 215 ml of diluent or about 250 ml of diluent. The iron

    carbohydrate complex can be intravenously injected as a bolus. For example, the iron
    carbohydrate complex can be intravenously injected as a bolus at a concentration of about 1000
    mg elemental iron in about 200 mi to about 300 ml of diluent, preferably about 215 mi of diluent
    or about 250 ml of diluent: The iron carbohydrate complex can be intramuscularly infused at a
 5  concentration of, for example, about 1000 mg elemental iron in about 200 ml to about 300 ml of
    diluent, preferably, about 250 ml of diluent or about 215 ml of diluent. If applied as an infusion,
    the iron carbohydrate complex can be diluted with sterile saline (e.g., polynuclear iron (Ill)
    hydroxide 4(R)-(poly-(1->4)-O-a-glucopyranosyl)-oxy-2(R),3(S),5(R),6-tetrahydroxy-hexanoate
    ("VIT-45") 0.9% m/V NaCl or 500 mg iron in up to 250 mL NaCI). The iron carbohydrate complex
10  can be intravenously injected as a bolus without dilution. As an example, the iron carbohydrate
    complex can be intramuscularly injected at a concentration of about 500 mg elemental iron in
    less than about 10 ml diluent, preferably about 5 mi.
              [0 03 6    Generally, total iron dosage will depend on the iron deficit of the patient. One
    skilled in the art can tailor the total iron dose required for a subject while avoiding iron overload,
15  as overdosing with respect to the total required amount of iron has to be avoided, as is the case
    for all iron preparations.
               [0037]    The total iron dosage can be delivered as a single unit dosage or a series of
     single unit dosages. An appropriate single unit dosage level will generally be at least 0.6 grams
    of elemental iron, particularly at least 0.7 grams; at least 0.8 grams; at least 0.9 grams; at least
20   1.0 grams; at least 1.1 grams; at least 1.2 grams; at least 1.3 grams; at least 1.4 grams; at least
     1.5 grams; at least 1.6 grams; at least 1.7 grams; at least 1.8 grams; at least 1.9 grams; at least
     2.0 grams; at least 2.1 grams; at least 2.2 grams; at least 2.3 grams; at least 2.4 grams; or at
     least 2.5 grams. For example, a single unit dosage is at least 1.0 grams of elemental iron. As
     another example, a single unit dosage is at least 1.5 grams of elemental iron. As a further
25   example, a single unit dosage is at least 2.0 grams of elemental iron. In yet another example, a
     single unit dosage is at least 2.5 grams of elemental iron.
               [003 8    An appropriate single unit dosage level can also be determined on the basis of
     patient weight. For example, an appropriate single unit dosage level will generally be at least 9
     mg of elemental iron per kg body weight, particularly at least 10.5 mg/kg, at least 12 mg/kg, at
30   least 13.5 mg/kg, at least 15 mg/kg, at least 16.5 mg/kg, at least 18 mg/kg, at least 19.5 mg/kg,
     at least 21 mg/kg, at least 22.5 mg/kg, at least 24 mg/kg, at least 25.5 mg/kg, at least 27 mg/kg,
     at least 28.5 mg/kg, at least 30 mg/kg, at least 31.5 mg/kg, at least 33 mg/kg, at least 34.5
     mg/kg, at least 36 mg/kg, or at least 37.5 mg/kg.
               [0 039] Preferably, a single unit dosage can be administered in 15 minutes or less.
35    For example, the single unit dosage can be administered in 14 minutes or less, 13 minutes or
      less, 12 minutes or less, 11 minutes or less, 10 minutes or less, 9 minutes or less, 8 minutes or

 WO 2007/081744                                                           PCT/US2007/000176
    less, 7 minutes or less, 6 minutes or less, 5 minutes or less, 4 minutes or less, 3 minutes or less,
    or 2 minutes or less.
             [00402 Administration of iron can occur as a one-time delivery of a single unit dose or
    over a course of treatment involving delivery of multiple single unit doses. Multiple single unit
 5  doses can be administered, for example, over pre-determined time intervals 'or in response to the
    appearance and reappearance of symptoms. The frequency of dosing depends on the disease
    or disorder being treated, the response of each individual patient, and the administered amount
    of elemental iron. An appropriate regime of dosing adequate to allow the body to absorb the iron
    from the bloodstream can be, for example, a course of therapy once every day to once every
10  eighteen months.
              [00412 Such consecutive single unit dosing can be designed to deliver a relatively
    high total dosage of iron over a relatively low period of time. For example, a single unit dose
    (e.g., 1000 mg) can be administered every 24 hours. As illustration, a total dose of 2000, 2500,
    3000, 3500, 4000, 4500, or 5000 mg of elemental iron can be delivered via consecutive daily
15  single unit doses of about 600 mg to about 1000 mg of elemental iron. Given that a single unit
    dose of 1000 mg can be intravenously introduced into a patient in a concentrated form over, for
     example, two minutes, such administrative protocol provides a practitioner and patient with an
    effective, efficient, and safe means to deliver elemental iron.
              [0042)      As another example, a single unit dose can be administered every 3-4 days.
20  As a further example, a single unit dose can be administered once per week. Alternatively, the
     single unit doses of iron complex may be administered ad hoc, that is, as symptoms reappear, as
     long as safety precautions are regarded as practiced by medical professionals.
               [0 0432 It will be understood, however, that the specific dose and frequency of
     administration for any particular patient may be varied and depends upon a variety of factors,
25   including the activity of the employed iron complex, the metabolic stability and length of action of
     that complex, the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, mode and time of administration,
     rate of excretion, drug combination, the severity and nature of the particular condition, and the
     host undergoing therapy.
               [0044] The following provides but a few examples of treatment protocols for various
30   diseases or disorders.
               [0045]     Iron carbohydrate complex can be given as a single unit dose for the treatment
     of Restless Leg Syndrome. For example, 1000 mg of elemental iron from an iron
     carboxymaltose (e.g., polynuclear iron (Ill)-hydroxide 4(R)-(poly-(1-+4)-O-a-glucopyranosyl)-oxy
     2(R),3(S),5(R),6-tetrahydroxy-hexanoate) can be intravenously injected as a single dose (e.g.,
35    1.5-5 mg iron/mI in normal saline) to a subject suffering from Restless Leg Syndrome. A single
     intravenous treatment can provide relief of symptoms for an extended period of time,

    approximately two to twelve months, although relief may be granted for shorter or longer periods.
    See U.S. Patent Pub. No. 2004/0180849, incorporated herein by reference. If desired, post
    infusion changes in central nervous system iron status can be monitored using measurements of
    cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) ferritin (and other iron-related proteins) and of brain iron stores using
 5  MRI. Post-infusion changes in Restless Leg Syndrome are assessed using standard subjective
    (e.g., patient diary, rating scale) and objective (e.g., P50, SIT, Leg Activity Meters) measures of
    clinical status. If desired, to better evaluate RLS symptom amelioration, CSF and serum iron
    values, MRI measures of brain iron and full clinical evaluations with sleep and immobilization
    tests are obtained prior to treatment, approximately two weeks after treatment, and again twelve
10   months later or when symptoms return. Clinical ratings, Leg Activity Meter recordings and serum
    ferritin are obtained monthly after treatment. CSF ferritin changes can also be used to assess
     symptom dissipation.
              [0046]     Iron carbohydrate complex can be given as a single unit dose for the treatment
     of iron deficiency anemia secondary to heavy uterine bleeding. For example, a single unit dose
15   of 1,000 mg of elemental iron from an iron carboxymaltose in about 250 cc normal saline can be
     intravenously injected into a subject suffering from iron deficiency anemia secondary to heavy
     uterine bleeding over 15 minutes every week until a calculated iron deficit dose has been
     administered. The iron deficit dose can be calculated as follows:
                              If baseline TSAT < 20% or Baseline Ferritin < 50 ng/ml:
20                    Dose = Baseline weight (kg) x (15-Baseline Hgb [g/dL]) x 2.4 + 500

25                            (NOTE: Baseline Hgb equals the average of the last two
                      central lab Hgb's)
              (0047]      Iron carbohydrate complex can be given as a single unit dose for the treatment
     of iron deficiency anemia. A subject diagnosed as suffering from iron deficiency anemia can be,
     for example, intravenously injected with a dose of 1,000 mg of iron as VIT- 45 (or 15 mg/kg for
30   weight < 66 kg) in 250 cc of normal saline over 15 minutes. Subjects with iron deficiency anemia
     secondary to dialysis or non-dialysis dependent-Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) as per K/DOQI
      guidelines will generally have Hgb < 12 g/dL; TSAT < 25%; and Ferritin < 300 ng/mL. Subjects
     with iron deficiency anemia secondary to Inflammatory Bowel Disease will generally have Hgb <
      12 g/dL; TSAT < 25%; and Ferritin < 300 ng/mL. Subjects with iron deficiency anemia secondary
35   to other conditions will generally have Hgb < 12 g/dL-; TSAT < 25%; and Ferritin < 100 ng/mL.

    subjects with functional iron deficiency such as those on erythropoietin therapy. A determination
    of the need for treatment with parenteral iron is within the abilities of one skilled in the art. For
    example, need can be assessed by monitoring a patient's iron status. The diagnosis of iron
    deficiency can be based on appropriate laboratory tests, for example, haemoglobin (Hb), serum
 5  ferritin, serum iron, transferrin saturation (TfS), and hypochromic red cells.
               [0050] A determination of the need for treatment with high dosages of parenteral iron
    can be also be determined through diagnosis of a patient as suffering from a disease, disorder,
    or condition that is associated with iron deficiency or dysfunctional iron metabolism. For
    example, many chronic renal failure patients receiving erythropoietin will require intravenous iron
10  to maintain target iron levels. As another example, most hemodialysis patients will require
    repeated intravenous iron administration, due to dialysis-associated blood loss and resulting
    negative iron balance.
               [0051]    Monitoring frequency can depend upon the disease, disorder, or condition the
    patient is afflicted with or at risk for. For example, in a patient initiating erythropoietin therapy,
15  iron indices are monitored monthly. As another example, in patients who have achieved target
    range Hb or are receiving intravenous iron therapy, TSAT and ferritin levels can be monitored
    every 3 months.
               [0052]    A patient's iron status can be indicative of an absolute or a functional iron
    deficiency, both of which can be treated with the compositions and methods described herein.
20  An absolute iron deficiency occurs when an insufficient amount of iron is available to meet the
    body's requirements. The insufficiency may be due to inadequate iron intake, reduced
    bioavailability of dietary iron, increased utilization of iron, or chronic blood loss. Prolonged iron
    deficiency can lead to iron deficiency anemia-a microcytic, hypochromic anemia in which there
    are inadequate iron stores. Absolute iron deficiency is generally indicated where TSAT <20%
25  and Ferritin <100 ng/mL.
               [0053] Functional iron deficiency can occur where there is a failure to release iron
    rapidly enough to keep pace with the demands of the bone marrow for erythropoiesis, despite
    adequate total body iron stores. In these cases, ferritin levels may be normal or high, but the
    supply of iron to the erythron is limited, as shown by a low transferrin saturation and an increased
30  number of microcytic, hypochromic erythrocytes. Functional iron deficiency can be characterized
    by the following characteristics: Inadequate hemoglobin response to erythropoietin; Serum ferritin
    may be normal or high; Transferrin saturation (TSAT) usually <20%; and/or reduced mean
    corpuscular volume (MCV) or mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) in severe
    cases. Functional iron deficiency (i.e., iron stores are thought to be adequate but unavailable for
35  iron delivery) is generally indicated where TSAT <20% and Ferritin >100 ng/mL.
               [0054] Assessing the need for intravenous iron therapy as described herein can be
    according to the National Kidney Foundation's Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative. See

    NKF-K/DOQI, Clinical Practice Guidelines for Anemia of Chronic Kidney Disease (2000); Am J
    Kidney Dis (2001) 37(supp 1), S182-S238. The DOQI provides optimal clinical practices for the
    treatment of anemia in chronic renal failure. The DOQI guidelines specify intravenous iron
    treatment of kidney disease based on hemoglobin, transferrin saturation (TSAT), and ferritin
 5  levels.
              [0055] Assessment of need for intravenous iron therapy can also be according to a
    patient's target iron level. For example, the target hemoglobin level of a patient can be selected
    as 11.0 g/dL to 12.0 g/dL (hematocrit approximately 33% to 36%). To achieve target hemoglobin
    with optimum erythropoietin doses, sufficient iron, supplied via an iron carbohydrate complex, is
10  provided to maintain TSAT 220% and ferritin ;100 ng/mL. In erythropoietin-treated patients, if
    TSAT levels are below 20%, the likelihood that hemoglobin will rise or erythropoietin doses fall
    after iron administration is high. Achievement of target hemoglobin levels with optimum
     erythropoietin doses is associated with providing sufficient iron to maintain TSAT above 20%.
              [0056] Iron therapy can be given to maintain target hemoglobin while preventing iron
15   deficiency and also preventing iron overload. Adjusting dosage of iron to maintain target levels
     of hemoglobin, hematocrit, and laboratory parameters of iron storage is within the normal skill in
     the art. For example, where a patient is anemic or iron deficient, intravenous iron can be
     administered when a patient has a ferritin <800, a TSAT<50, and/or a Hemoglobin <12. Iron
     overload can be avoided by withholding iron for TSAT >50% and/or ferritin >800 ng/mL.
20            [0057] Where a patient is not anemic or iron deficient but is in need of iron
     administration, for example a patient suffering from Restless Leg Syndrome, hemoglobin and
     TSAT levels are not necessarily relevant, while ferritin >800 can still provides a general cut off
     point for administration.
              [0058]     Iron Carbohydrate Complex
25             [0059]    Iron carbohydrate complexes are commercially available, or have well known
     syntheses. Examples of iron carbohydrate complexes include iron monosaccharide complexes,
     iron disaccharide complexes, iron oligosaccharide complexes, and iron polysaccharide
     complexes, such as: iron carboxymaltose, iron sucrose, iron polyisomaltose (iron dextran), iron
     polymaltose (iron dextrin), iron gluconate, iron sorbitol, iron hydrogenated dextran, which may be
30   further complexed with other compounds, such as sorbitol, citric acid and gluconic acid (for
     example iron dextrin-sorbitol-citric acid complex and iron sucrose-gluconic acid complex), and
      mixtures thereof.

10  Likewise, techniques such as electron micrograph imaging, transmission electron microscopy,
    and atomic force microscopy provide direct methods to analyze both iron core and particle size.
    See e.g., Figure 1; Table 1. The stability of the carbohydrate complex can be assessed through

     Pharmacdkinetics can be assessed, for example, by iron tracer experiments. Hypersensitivity
     reactions can be monitored and assessed as described in, for example, Bailie et al. (2005)

             (0062] A particularly preferred iron carbohydrate complex will have a pH between 5.0

             [0065]       One preferred iron carbohydrate complex for use in the methods described
    herein is an iron carboxymaltose complex. An example of an iron carboxymaltose complex is
    polynuclear iron (I1)-hydroxide 4(R)-(poly-(1--4)-O-a-glucopyranosyl)-oxy-2(R),3(S),5(R),6
    tetrahydroxy-hexanoate ("VIT-45"). VIT-45 is a Type I polynuclear iron (Ill) hydroxide
 5  carbohydrate complex that can be administered as parenteral iron replacement therapy for the
    treatment of various anemija-related conditions as well as other iron-metabolism related
    conditions. VIT-45 can be represented by the chemical formula: [FeOx(OH)y(H20)zln
    [{(C6H1005)m (C6H1207)}l ]k, where n is about 103, m is about 8, i is about 11, and k is about
    4). The molecular weight of VIT-45 is about 150,000 Da. An exemplary depiction of VIT-45 is
10  provided in Figure 2.
              [0 066]     The degradation rate and physicochemical characteristics of the iron
    carbohydrate complex (e.g., VIT-45) make it an efficient means of parenteral iron delivery to the
    body stores. It is more efficient and less toxic than the lower molecular weight complexes such
    as iron sorbitol/citrate complex, and does not have the same limitations of high pH and
15  osmolarity that leads to dosage and administration rate limitations in the case of, for example,
     iron sucrose and iron gluconate.
              [0067] The iron carboxymaltose complex (e.g., VIT-45) generally does not contain
     dextran and does not react with dextran antibodies; therefore, the risk of anaphylactoid
    /hypersensitivity reactions is very low compared to iron dextran. The iron carboxymaltose
20  complex (e.g., VIT-45) has a nearly neutral pH (5.0 to 7.0) and physiological osmolarity, which
     makes it possible to administer higher single unit doses over shorter time periods than other iron
    carbohydrate complexes. The iron carboxymaltose complex (e.g., VIT-45) can mimic
     physiologically occurring ferritin. The carbohydrate moiety of iron carboxymaltose complex (e.g.,
    VIT-45) is metabolized by the glycolytic pathway. Like iron dextran, the iron carboxymaltose
25   complex (e.g., VIT-45) is more stable than iron gluconate and sucrose. The iron carboxymaltose
     complex (e.g., VIT-45) produces a slow and competitive delivery of the complexed iron to
     endogenous iron binding sites resulting in an acute toxicity one-fifth that of iron sucrose. These
     characteristics of the iron carboxymaltose complex (e.g., VIT-45) allow administration of higher
     single unit doses over shorter periods of time than, for example, iron gluconate or iron sucrose.
30   Higher single unit doses can result in the need for fewer injections to replete iron stores, and
     consequently is often better suited for outpatient use.
              [0068) After intravenous administration, the iron carboxymaltose complex (e.g., VIT
     45) is mainly found in the liver, spleen, and bone marrow. Pharmacokinetic studies using
     positron emission tomography have demonstrated a fast initial elimination of radioactively labeled
35   iron (Fe) 5 2Fe/ 59Fe VIT-45 from the blood, with rapid transfer to the bone marrow and rapid
     deposition in the liver and spleen. See e.g., Beshara et al. (2003) Br J Haematol 2003; 120(5):
     853-859. Eight hours after administration,5 to 20% of the injected amount was observed to be

 WO 2007/081744                                                              PCT/US2007/000176
     still in the blood, compared with 2 to 13% for iron sucrose. The projected calculated terminal
     half-life (ty) was approximately 16 hours, compared to 3 to 4 days for iron dextran and 6 hours for
     iron sucrose.
                [0069] The iron in the iron carboxymaltose complex (e.g., VIT-45) slowly dissociates
 5   from the complex and can be efficiently used in the bone marrow for Hgb synthesis. Under VIT
     45 administration, red cell utilization, followed for 4 weeks, ranged from 61% to 99%. Despite the
     relatively higher uptake by the bone marrow, there was no saturation of marrow transport
     systems. Thus, high red cell utilization of iron carboxymaltose complex occurs in anemic
     patients. In addition, the reticuloendothelial uptake of this complex reflects the safety of
10   polysaccharide complexes. Non-saturation of transport systems to the bone marrow indicated
     the presence of a large interstitial transport pool (e.g., transferrin).
                [0070)     Other studies in patients with iron deficiency anemia revealed increases in
     exposure roughly proportional with VIT-45 dose (maximal total serum iron concentration was
     approximately 150 pg/mL and 320 pg/mL following 500 mg and 1000 mg doses, respectively). In
15   these studies, VIT-45 demonstrated a monoexponential elimination pattern with a t112 in the range
     7 to 18 hours, with negligible renal elimination.
                [0071]     Single-dose toxicity studies have demonstrated safety and tolerance in
     rodents and dogs of intravenous doses of an iron carboxymaltose complex (VIT-45) up to 60
     times more than the equivalent of an intravenous infusion of 1,000 mg iron once weekly in
20   humans. Pre-clinical studies in dogs and rats administered VIT-45 in cumulative doses up to 117
     mg iron/kg body weight over 13 weeks showed no observed adverse effect level in dose-related
     clinical signs of iron accumulation in the liver, spleen, and kidneys. No treatment-related local
     tissue irritation was observed in intra-arterial, perivenous, or intravenous tolerance studies in the
     rabbit. In vitro and in vivo mutagenicity tests provided no evidence that VIT-45 is clastogenic,
25   mutagenic, or causes chromosomal damage or bone marrow cell toxicity. There were no specific
     responses to VIT-45 in a dextran antigenicity test.
                [0 072]    Approximately 1700 subjects have been treated with an iron carboxymaltose
     complex (VIT-45) in open label clinical trials (see e.g., Example 5). Many of these subjects have
     received at least one dose of 15mg/kg (up to a maximum dose of 1,000 mg) of VIT-45 over 15
30   minutes intravenously. Few adverse events and no serious adverse events or withdrawals due
     to adverse events related to VIT-45 administration have been reported. No clinically relevant
     adverse changes in safety laboratories have been seen.
                [0073]    The physicochernical characteristics of the iron carboxymaltose complex (e.g.,
     VIT-45), the pattern of iron deposition, and the results of the above described studies
35   demonstrate that iron carboxymaltose complex can be safely administered at high single unit
     therapeutic doses as described herein.

              [0075]    Another preferred iron carbohydrate complex for use in the methods described
    herein is a polyglucose sorbitol carboxymethyl ether-coated non-stoichiometric magnetite (e.g.,
    "ferumoxytol"). Ferumoxytol is known in the art to be effective for treating anemia (at single unit
 5  doses lower than described herein). See e.g., Spinowitz et al. (2005) Kidney Intl 68, 1801-1807.
    Ferumoxytol is a superparamagnetic iron oxide that is coated with a low molecular weight semi
    synthetic carbohydrate, polyglucose sorbitol carboxymethyl ether. Ferumoxytol and its synthesis
    are described in U.S. Patent No. 6,599,498, incorporated herein by reference. Safety, efficacy,
    and pharmacokinetics of ferumoxytol are as described, for example, in Landry et al. (2005) Am J
10  Nephrol 25, 400-410, 408; and Spinowitz et al. (2005) Kidney Intl 68, 1801-1807.
              [00763 The iron oxide of ferumoxytol is a superparamagnetic form of non
    stoichiometric magnetite with a crystal size of 6.2 to 7.3 nm. Average colloidal particle size can
    be about 30 nm, as determined by light scattering. Molecular weight is approximately 750 kD.
    The osmolarity of ferumoxytol is isotonic at 297 mOsm/kg and the pH is neutral. The blood half
15  life of ferumoxytol is approximately 10-14 hours. It has been previously reported that ferumoxytol
    can be given by direct intravenous push over 1-5 minutes in doses up to 1,800 mg elemental iron
    per minute, with maximal total dose up to 420 mg per injection. Landry et al. (2005) Am J
    Nephrol 25, 400-410, 408.
              [0077]    Core and Particle Size
20            [0078] Intravenous iron agents are generally spheroidal iron-carbohydrate
    nanoparticles. At the core of each particle is an iron-oxyhydroxide gel. The core is surrounded
    by a shell of carbohydrate that stabilizes the iron-oxyhydroxide, slows the release of bioactive
    iron, and maintains the resulting particles in colloidal suspension. Iron agents generally share
    the same core chemistry but differ from each other by the size of the core and the identity and
25  the density of the surrounding carbohydrate. See Table 1; Figure 1.

              [007 9]      Differences in core size and carbohydrate chemistry can determine
     pharmacological and biological differences, including clearance rate after injection, iron release
     rate in vitro, early evidence of iron bioactivity in vivo, and maximum tolerated dose and rate of
 5   infusion.
              [0080] One of the primary determinants of iron bioactivity is the size of the core and
     the surface area to volume ratio. Generally, the rate of labile iron release in each agent is
     inversely related to the size of its iron core. Van Wyck (2004) J. Am. Soc. Nephrology 15, S107
     S111, S109. Furthermore, in vitro iron donation to transferrin is inversely related to core size.
10   Core size can depend upon the number of iron atoms contained within. For example, the
     number of iron atoms contained within a 1 nm core is calculated to be 13, while a 10 nm core'is
     calculated to contain 12770 iron atoms. Where agents share the same core chemistry, the rate
     of iron release per unit surface area is likely similar, differing perhaps by the strength of the
     carbohydrate ligand-core iron bound. But for the same total amount of core iron, surface area
15   available for iron release increases dramatically as core radius decreases. That is to say, for
     equal amounts of iron, the smaller the core, the greater the surface area available for iron
     release. Of course, the explanation for this non-linear trend is the fact that volume is radius
     cubed. In short, a collection of many small spheres exposes a greater total surface area than
     does a collection of an equal mass of fewer, larger spheres.
20             [008.]      A smaller iron core size of an iron complex administered for the treatment of
     various diseases, disorders, or conditions allows wider distribution through tissues, a greater rate
     of labile iron release, and increased in vitro iron donation to transferrin. Furthermore, the iron
     complex is more evenly distributed and metabolizes faster due to the smaller core size. But if the
     core size is too small, the iron complex can move into cells unable to metabolize iron. In one
25   embodiment, an iron complex with a mean iron core size of no greater than about 9 nm is
                                                         - 17-

  WO 2007/081744                                                           PCT/US2007/000176
     administered. In various embodiments, mean iron core size is less than about 9 nm but greater
     than about 1 nm, about 2 nm, about 3 nm, about 4 nm, about 5 nm, about 6 nm, about 7 nm, or
     about 8 nm. Mean iron core size can be, for example, between about 1 nm and about 9 nm;
     between about 3 nm and about 7 nm; or between about 4 nm and about 5 nm.
 5              [0082] The molecular weight (i.e., the whole molecular weight of the agent) is
     considered a primary determinant in the pharmacokinetics, or in other words, how quickly it is
     cleared from the blood stream. The amount of labile (i.e., biologicaly available) iron is inversely
     correlated with the molecular weight of the iron-carbohydrate complex. Van Wyck (2004) J. Am.
     Soc. Nephrology 15, S107-S111, S109. That is to say, the magnitude of labile iron effect is
10   greatest in iron-carbohydrate compounds of lowest molecular weight and least in those of the
     highest molecular weight. Generally, there is a direct relationship between the molecular weight
     of the agent and the mean diameter of the entire particle (i.e., the iron core along with the
     carbohydrate shell). In various embodiments, the mean diameter size of a particle of the iron
     carbohydrate complex is no greater than about 35 nm. For example, the particle mean size can
15   be no greater than about 30 nm. As another example, the particle mean size can be no greater
     than about 25 nm. As another example, the particle mean size can be no greater than about 20
     nm. As another example, the particle mean size can be no greater than about 15 nm. As a
     further example, the particle mean size can be no greater than about 10 nm. As another
     example, the particle mean size can be no greater than about 7 nm.
20               [0083]   Absence of Significant Adverse Reaction to the Single Dosage Unit
     Administration
                [00843    Generally, a safe and effective amount of an iron carbohydrate complex is, for
     example, that amount that would cause the desired therapeutic effect in a patient while
      minimizing undesired side effects. The dosage regimen will be determined by skilled clinicians,
25    based on factors such as the exact nature of the condition being treated, the severity of the
     condition, the age and general physical condition of the patient, and so on. Generally, treatment
     emergent adverse events will occur in less than about 5% of treated patients. For example,
     treatment-emergent adverse events will occur in less than 4% or 3% of treated patients.
      Preferably, treatment-emergent adverse events will occur in less than about 2% of treated
30    patients.
                 [O0s85   For example, minimized undesirable side effects can include those related to
      hypersensitivity reactions, sometimes classified as sudden onset closely related to the time of
     dosing, including hypotension, bronchospasm, layngospasm, angioedema or uticaria or several
      of these together. Hypersensitivity reactions are reported with all current intravenous iron
35    products independent of dose. See generally Baillie et al. (2005) Nephrol Dial Transplant, 20(7),
      1443-1449. As another example, minimized undesirable side effects can include those related to

    Example 1: Non-Toxicity Studies
               [0101]     Nonclinical toxicity of VIT-45 is very low, as is normal for Type I polynuclear
    iron (Il)-hydroxide carbohydrate complexes. The single dose toxicity is so low that the LD 5o
    could not be estimated and is higher than 2000 mg iron/kg b.w. Mice tested with a single dose of
 5   250 mg iron/kg b.w., injected within 2 seconds, showed no signs of illness. The highest non
     lethal dose level of 1000 mg iron/kg b.w. in mice and rats is also very high in comparison to a
     single unit dose of, for example, 15 mg iron/kg b.w. once per week in humans. These results
     provide factors of about 70-fold a human dose, demonstrating a large safety margin for acute
     toxicity of the product.
10   Example 2: Pharmokinetic Studies
               [0102] Pharmacokinetic and red blood cell measurements of s2Fe/ 59Fe labelled VIT
     45 following i.v. administration using PET in 6 patients showed a red blood cell utilization from 61
     to 99%. The 3 patients with iron deficiency anemia showed a utilization of radiolabelled iron of 91
     to 99% after 24 days, compared to 61 to 84% for 3 patients with renal anaemia. The terminal tW2
15   for VIT-45 was calculated to be approximately 16 hours, compared to about 6 hours for iron
     sucrose. In two further studies in patients with iron deficiency anemia, pharmacokindtic analyses
     revealed increases in exposure roughly proportional with VIT-45 dose (Cmax approximately 150
     pg/mL and 320 pg/mL following 500 mg and 1000 mg doses, respectively). VIT-45 demonstrated
     a monoexponential elimination pattern with a t1/2 in the range 7 to 18 hours. There was negligible
20   renal elimination.
     Example 3: Efficacy Studies
                [0103] The main pharmacodynamic effects of VIT-45 were transient elevations of
     serum iron levels, TfS and serum ferritin. These effects were seen in all studies (where
     measured), following both single doses and repeated doses. The increase in serum ferritin levels
25-  illustrated the replenishment of the depleted iron stores, which is a well-identified and desired
     effect of iron therapy. In addition, transiently elevated TfS indicated that iron binding capacity was
     almost fully utilized following VIT-45 infusion.
                [0104]    Efficacy of iron replacement therapy is interpreted mainly in terms of the ability
     to normalise Hb levels and iron stores. In the multiple dose studies, patients demonstrated a
30   slowly-developing, sustained increase in Hb levels during study participation. In one study, 37%
      and 48% of patients in Cohorts 1 and 2, respectively, had achieved normal Hb levels at the 4
     week follow-up visit, and 75% and 73%, respectively, had achieved a 220 g/L increase in Hb on
     at least 1 occasion.
                [0105)    In another study (patients receiving regular haemodialysis), the majority of
35    patients (61.7%) achieved an increase of Hb of Z10 g/L at any point during the study. Serum
     ferritin and TfS levels showed a more prolonged elevation following repeated VIT-45 infusions,

     indicating a sustained replenishment of iron stores. However, elevated levels of ferritin and TfS
     indicating iron overload were avoided. In both of these studies, there was a gradual decrease in
     transferrin over time, also indicating successful iron replacement.
     Example 4: Safety Assessments
 5            [010 6 1 Safety assessments were made in 73 patients with iron deficiency anemia (27
     single-dose, 46 repeated-dose), and 166 patients with renal anaemia (3 single-dose, 163
     repeated-dose) who received VIT-45 at individual iron doses of 100 mg up to 1000 mg
     (cumulative doses of 100 to 2200 mg). These studies showed a safety profile equal to, or
     exceeding, currently available parenteral iron formulations.
10            [01071 In the single-dose studies, there were few adverse events and no serious
     adverse events or withdrawals due to adverse events. There were also no related clinically
     relevant adverse changes in vital signs, 12-lead ECGs or laboratory safety tests.
              [010 8)    In the repeated-dose studies, there were no deaths attributed to VIT-45, while
      10 patients experienced serious adverse events. All of these cases occurred in patients with
15   renal anaemia receiving haemodialysis and were considered not related to the VIT-45 treatment.
     Very few patients were withdrawn from the studies due to treatment-emergent adverse events,
     and only 2 withdrawals (due to allergic skin reactions) were considered possibly related to
     treatment. In each of the repeated-dose studies, no patients experienced clinically significant
     changes in 12-lead ECGs that were related to treatment. There were no consistent changes in
20   laboratory safety parameters, although there was a low incidence (total 6 patients) of laboratory
     values reported as treatment-related treatment-emergent adverse events (elevated CRP, AST,
     ALT and GGT, abnormal liver function tests and elevated WBC).
              [01091     Although many patients in these 2 studies had serum ferritin above 500 pg/L
     on at least 1 occasion during the study, very few patients also had TfS values >50%. Generally,
25   the elevations of ferritin and TfS were of short duration. Iron overload was avoided using the
     dosing schedules defined in the studies.
      Example 5: Integrated Safety Studies
               [0110] The following example demonstrates the safety and effectiveness of
      parenteral VIT-45 in the treatment of anemia in a variety of patient populations, as determined
30   from several integrated safety studies.
               [0111] A total of 2429 subjects were treated with VIT-45 or control agents over 10
      studies that provide safety data for VIT-45. Of these, 1709 subjects received VIT-45 (1095 in
      completed multicenter studies, 584 in placebo-controlled, single-dose, crossover studies and 30
      in pharmacokinetic studies). The mean total dose of VIT-45 administered among the
35    1095 subjects in the completed multicenter studies was approximately 1300 mg; however, some
                                                      - 23 -

     subjects received VIT-45 doses as high as 3400 mg. The majority of the subjects treated were
     able to receive their calculated iron requirement in only 1 or 2 doses.

              [0113]      Study A was a single-center, single-dose escalation, randomized, double
 5   blind, placebo-controlled pharmacokinetic study. Subjects were male and female, between 18
     and 45 years of age, inclusive, with mild iron-deficiency anemia. Treatment was a single IV
     bolus injection of VIT-45 at 100 mg, 500 mg, 800 mg, or 1000 mg. Examined pharmacokinetic
     parameters included total serum iron and pharmacodynamic (serum ferritin and transferrin, iron
     binding capacity, %TSATpost, hemoglobin, reticulocyte, and serum transferrin receptor

     renal anemia with no other cause of anaemia. Inclusion criteria included hemoglobin
15   concentration between 9 and 13 g/dL, no blood transfusions in the previous 3 months, and no
     history of treatment with intravenous iron in the last 2 weeks. Treatment was a single IV bolus

               [0115)     Study C was an open-label, multicenter, randomized, multiple-dose, active
     controlled postpartum anemia study. Subjects were female, postpartum within 10 days after
     delivery, with hemoglobin 10 g/dL at Baseline based on the average of 2 hemoglobin values
     drawn Z1 8 hours postpartum. Treatment was once weekly doses of VIT-45 for six weeks. VIT
25   45 dosage was based on the calculated iron deficit ( 2500 mg total). Where screening serum
     transferrin saturation (TSAT) was 20% or screening ferritin was 50 ng/mL, dosage = pre
      pregnancy weight (kg) x (15-baseline hemoglobin [g/dL]) x 2.4 + 500 mg. Where screening
     TSAT was >20% and screening ferritin was >50 ng/mL, dosage = pre-pregnancy weight (kg) x
      (15-baseline hemoglobin [g/dL]) x 2.4. Infusion of VIT-45 was as follows: 5200 mg, administered
30    as an undiluted intravenous push (IVP) over 1-2 minutes; 300-400 mg, administered in 100 cc
      normal saline solution (NSS) over 6 minutes; 500-1,000 mg administered in 250 cc NSS over
      15 minutes. For primary efficacy, "success" was defined as an increase in hemoglobin of 2 g/dL
      anytime between baseline and end of study or time of intervention, while "failure" was defined as
      <2 g/dL increase in hemoglobin at all times between baseline and end of study or time of
35    intervention. Examined safety parameters included adverse events, clinical laboratory
      evaluations, vital signs, and physical examinations.

   were reported by <2% of subjects who were treated with VIT-45; none of these events
   was considered serious and few led to premature discontinuation.
            [0129]     Laboratory evaluations of mean changes from baseline and potentially
   clinically significant values demonstrated no clinically meaningful changes for the majority
 5 of the parameters evaluated. However, during the conduct of the latter portion of the
   clinical program, transient, asymptomatic decreases in blood phosphate levels were
   observed among subjects treated with VIT-45. The decreases were apparent
   approximately 7 days after the initial dose of VIT-45 and the median time to recovery was
   approximately 2 weeks. No subjects reported an adverse event that was related to serum
10 phosphate and no subject discontinued from the study due to decreased serum
   phosphate. The only predictor of change in serum phosphate was that subjects with
   higher baseline serum phosphate values had larger decreases in serum phosphate. The
   fact that the majority of oral iron-treated subjects also had a post-baseline decrease in
   phosphate and the negative correlation of baseline serum phosphate with changes in
15 serum phosphate for both the VIT-45 and oral iron treatment groups suggest that the
   mechanism is intrinsic to iron therapy in this severely anemic population.
            [0130]     Overall, no clinically meaningful changes in vitals signs evaluations were
   associated with VIT-45 administration.
            [0131]     Safety data from more than 1700 subjects demonstrate the safety and
20 tolerability of VIT-45.
