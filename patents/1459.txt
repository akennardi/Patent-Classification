                    LIGHTWEIGHT STEEL CONSTRUCTION
Field of the Invention
      The present invention relates to constructions of buildings, in particular to a
lightweight steel construction made by C-shaped steels.
Description of the Prior Art
      Because the concern on environmental protection becomes popular, industries
have their own ways to avoid pollution, greenhouse effect, and global warming for
achieving a target with minimum produced wastes and minimum consumed
resources.     Taking architecture industries as an example, most economical
construction materials and structures are targeted in premise of achieving
requirements on structural strength, as known as green architectures.    Lightweight
steel constructions are one of the green architectures.
      Because    the  lightweight   steel  constructions have   features  of safety,
environmental-friendly concern, high efficiency, lightweight components, and so on,
lightweight steel constructions are developed rapidly.    For example, in US, there
were 120,000 buildings with such requirements in 1998.     Regarding Japan, after the
Hanshin earthquake in 1995, developments and researches in lightweight steel
construction technologies and related construction specifications become faster.   In
addition, in Japan, related measures are also established to allow such technology
being suitable to be applied in Japan.      Technologies about the lightweight steel
constructions benefit the whole Japan.         Moreover, the technologies are also
introduced into Taiwan in recent years.

                                           2
     In general, C-shaped steels are the main components of the lightweight steel
construction.    The C-shaped steels can be formed as various crossbeams, columns,
or rafters.   In conventional, these crossbeams, columns, or rafters are combined
with each other by soldering.       However, such soldering requires processional
welders and high quality soldering techniques, leading higher costs.       In addition,
the C-shaped steels are treated by metal plating or zinc coating to be anti-rust, yet
soldering would damage the anti-rust coating, making the construction be prone to
be rusted.
     As a result, soldering is not recommended as a proper way for combining the
C-shaped steels.    Therefore, some manufacturers have developed components to
combine the C-shaped steels by locking.         For example, related techniques are
described in TW patent number 437782, 514089, 590134, 590135, M276067,
M297972, and M314222.         However, it is difficult to have a basic backbone of a
building by combining the C-shaped steels with the conventional components.           In
addition, the conventional components are insufficient in structural strength and
convenience.
     WO 2016/000021 Al discloses a lightweight steel construction as defined in
the preamble of claim 1.
     One object of the present invention is to provide a lightweight steel construction
in which positioning members are positioned with two ends of C-shaped steel(s) to
form crossbeams, columns, or rafters.        Then, any two of the aforementioned
components are further connected with each other by the positioning members.

                                           3
Therefore, the C-shaped steels can be formed as the basic backbone of a building by
locking in a fast and convenient manner.
     Another object of the present invention is that, the first positioning members in
a unitary structure can not only be combined with two C-shaped steels to form a
crossbeam or a column in rectangular tubular shaped, but also provided as
connection members between crossbeams or columns.            Therefore, the assembling
of the construction is very convenient.
     Yet another object of the present invention is that, the second positioning
members in a unitary structure can be combined with a C-shaped steel and an
adjacent crossbeam (or column).      Therefore, the supporting backbone of the floor
surface, the wall surface, and the roof of the building can be assembled rapidly and
conveniently.
     Still yet another object of the present invention is that, the first positioning
 members and the second positioning members are positioned on end surfaces of the
 two ends of the crossbeam (or the column, or the rafter), a surface angle of the end
 surface of the crossbeam (or the column, or the rafter) can be adjusted for
 constructing an inclined roof or eaves.     Therefore, constructing the roof of the
 building can be more convenient.
     A further object of the present invention is that, the two C-shaped steels are
 combined with each other to form a beam in rectangular tubular shaped by the first
 positioning members, and the first positioning member has the wire hole.
 Therefore, cables or wires can be inserted into the interior of the beam through the
 wire hole and protected by the C-shaped steels.        In addition, a separation gap

                                            4
between the two C-shaped steels of the beam can be provided for ventilation and
heat insulation.
    A further another object of the present invention is that, two ends of the beam
(or the rafter) have the positioning members.        Therefore, the building can have
modified or added construction in an easy manner.

                 DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS
     Please refer to Figs. 1 to 5. Fig. 1 illustrates a lightweight steel construction
 according to the present invention.        Fig. 1 is for illustrative purpose, not a
 limitation to the present invention.   The building 1 includes a plurality of beams 2
 and rafters 3. Wherein, the beams 2 are assembled with each other to form
 crossbeams 11 and columns 12 of the building 1. The rafter 3 is assembled
 between the crossbeam 11 and the column 12, the rafter 3 is provided as the
 supporting frame of a seal plate, and the rafter 3 can be formed as a floor surface 13,
 a wall surface 14, or a roof 15 of the building 1.
     Here, the beam 2 includes two C-shaped steels 4 and at least two first
 positioning members 5. Wherein, the C-shaped steel 4 has a front plate 41, two
 side plates 42 at two sides of the front plate 41, and two flanges 43 respectively
 extending toward each other from free sides of the side plates 42.     An opening 45
 is formed between the two flanges 43.       The first positioning member 5 has a first
 bottom surface 51 in rectangular shaped and first sidewalls 53 respectively
 extending from four edges of the first bottom surface 51 in a same direction.       In
 assembling, the openings 45 of the two C-shaped steels 4 are opposite to each other.
 Next, the two first positioning members 5 are respectively positioned with two ends

                                           8
of the two C-shaped steels 4 in a length direction of the C-shaped steels 4.
Therefore, the first sidewalls 53 of the first positioning member 5 respectively
correspond to the front plates 41 and the side plates 42 of the two C-shaped steels 4.
In addition, two opposite first sidewalls 53 of the first sidewalls 53 respectively
have a notch 52 and a baffle plate 57 between the notches 52.      The notches 52 and
the baffle plate 57 correspond to the flanges 43 of the C-shaped steels 4.         The
notches 52 are for the insertion of the flanges 43 of the C-shaped steels 4, the baffle
plate 57 is for the limitation of the flanges 43 of the C-shaped steels 4, so that two
separation gaps 22 are respectively formed on two opposite sides of the two
opposite C-shaped steels 4.     Then, the first sidewalls 53 of the first positioning
members 5 are locked with the front plates 41 and the corresponding side plates 42
of the C-shaped steels 4 by several locking members 6 to form the beam 2 in
rectangular tubular shaped.       Hence, the first bottom surface 51 of the first
positioning member 5 is located at the end surface of the beam 2 to form a
combination point 21 for combining with other beams 2.             Therefore, several
beams 2 are combined with each other via the combination points 21 and several
locking members 6 and formed as the crossbeams 11 and the columns 12 of the
building 1.
    When the beam 2 has a longer length, several first positioning members 5 may
be locked on proper portions between the two ends of the two C-shaped steels 4 in
the length direction of the C-shaped steels 4.       Therefore, the beam 2 can have
bamboo-joint structures to improve the structural strength of the beam 2.
Accordingly, the supporting performance of the crossbeams 11 and the columns 12

                                           9
formed by the beams 2 can be improved.
     Furthermore, a wire hole 56 is on a center of the first bottom surface 51 of the
first positioning member 5.         Therefore, electric cables, network cables, or
telephone wires can be inserted into the wire hole 56 and received in the
crossbeams 11 or the columns 12.           Accordingly, the crossbeams 11 and the
columns 12 can not only have a beautiful appearance but also can protect the wires
and cables.
     The rafter 3 includes a C-shaped steel 4 and at least two second positioning
members 7.      Wherein, the structure of the C-shaped steel 4 for forming the rafter 3
is the same as that of the C-shaped steel 4 for forming the beam 2.       The second
positioning member 7 has a second bottom surface 71 and second sidewalls 72
respectively extending from three connected edges of the second bottom surface 71
in a same direction.    The second sidewalls 72 of the second positioning member 7
are locked with the front plate 41 and the side plates 42 of the C-shaped steels 4 by
several locking members 6 to form the rafter 3.      The second bottom surface 71 of
the second positioning member 7 is located at the end surface of the rafter 3 to form
an assembling point 3 1.      Therefore, two ends of each of the rafters 3 can be
assembled between adjacent beams 2.        Accordingly, the rafters 3 can be provided
as the supporting frame of the floor surface 13, the wall surface 14, and the roof 15
of the building 1.
     In this embodiment, the locking member 6 is an assembly of an insert nut 61
and a bolt 62.    In operation, holes 46, 55, 73 are opened on the C-shaped steels 4,
the first positioning members 5, and the second positioning members 7.       Then, the

                                            10
insert nuts 61 are properly positioned in the holes 46, 55, 73.       Next, the bolts 62
are inserted into the insert nuts 61 and positioned with the insert nuts 61.
     Accordingly, upon assembling the building 1, the number and the size of the
C-shaped steels 4 as well as the number of the first positioning member 5 and that
of the second positioning member 7 can be computed in advance according to the
construction of the building 1.     Therefore, these components can be manufactured
in the factory and then transported to the construction site.
     At the construction site, several beams 2 are combined with each other via the
combination points 21 formed on the first bottom surfaces 51 of the first
positioning members 5 and formed as the crossbeams 11 and the columns 12 of the
construction of the building 1.      In detail, Fig. 6 illustrates a schematic exploded
view showing a crossbeam 11 is to be assembled with a column 12.              As shown,
the front plate 41 of one of the C-shaped steels 4 of a standing beam 2 is locked
with the first bottom surface 51 of the first positioning member 5 of a laid beam 2
by locking members 6, and the two C-shaped steels 4 of the laid beam 2 are locked
on the first sidewall 53 of the first positioning member 5 by locking members 6.
Accordingly, the standing beam 2 and the laid beam 2 can be assembled with each
other to be formed as the crossbeam 11 and the column 12 of the building 1.
     When the assembling of the crossbeams 11 and the columns 12 of the building
 1 is completed, the supporting frame of the floor surface 13, the wall surface 14,
and the roof 15 of the building 1 can be assembled by the rafters 3.          Taking the
wall surface 14 as an example, as shown in Fig. 7, the assembling points 31 of the
second positioning members 7 at the two ends of the rafter 3 are attached to the

                                          11
C-shaped steels 4 of the beam 2, and the second positioning members 7 of the rafter
3 and the C-shaped steels 4 of the beam 2 are locked with each other by locking
members 6.     Then, the two ends of the C-shaped steel 4 of the rafter 3 are locked
with the second sidewalls 72 of the second positioning member 7 by locking
members 6.    Accordingly, a supporting frame of the wall surface 14 can be formed
by several rafters 3, and subsequent plate sealing procedures can be performed on
the supporting frame of the wall surface 14 to form the wall surface 14 of the
building 1.   Similarly, the supporting frame of the floor surface 13 and the roof 15
of building 1 can be assembled by rafters 3.
    When the roof of the building 1 has an inclined surface, as shown in Fig. 8, the
end surface of the beam 2 and that of the rafter 3 assembled to two sides of the
column 12 of the roof as well as the end surface of the beam 2 for supporting the
roof can be cut to have an inclined plane for mating with the inclined surface of the
roof.   Therefore, the roof with an inclined surface can be assembled by the beams
2 and the rafters 3 via the combining points 21 formed on the first positioning
members 5 and the assembling points 31 formed on the second positioning
members 7.     Accordingly, additional components are not required in constructing
the roof.   Hence, the assembling of the building 1 can be convenient.
    Based on above, in the present invention, two ends of the C-shaped steels are
positioned with the positioning members to form crossbeams, columns, or rafters.
Then, any two of the aforementioned components are further connected with each
other by the positioning members.      Therefore, the C-shaped steels can be formed
as the backbone of a lightweight steel building by locking in a fast and convenient

                                          12
manner.
     Moreover, in the present invention, the C-shaped steels are assembled with the
first and second positioning members to form the crossbeams, the columns, and the
rafters of the building, and then the crossbeams, the columns, and the rafters are
assembled with each other by the first and second positioning members.
Therefore, builders can calculate the number and the size of the C-shaped steels as
well as the number of the first positioning members and that of the second
positioning    members   by computer      software  in advance.      Therefore,  the
components for constructing the building can be manufactured in the factory by a
one-time process and then the components are transported to the construction site.
Accordingly, the procedures of the construction at the construction site can be
simplified to improve the assembling efficiency of the building.
     Furthermore, because the first positioning members and the second positioning
members are positioned on the end surfaces of the two ends of the crossbeam (or
that of the column or that of the rafter), the angle of the end surface of the
crossbeam (or the column or the rafter) can be changed for assembling the roof or
the eaves having an inclined surface without additional components.       Therefore,
the assembling of the building can be convenient.
     Besides, the two C-shaped steels are combined with each other to form a beam
in rectangular tubular shaped by the first positioning members, and the first
positioning member has the wire hole.        Therefore, the cables or wires can be
inserted into the interior of the beam and protected by the C-shaped steels.      In
addition, the separation gap between the two C-shaped steels of the beam can be

                                          13
provided for ventilation and heat insulation.
