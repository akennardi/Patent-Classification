                                       ABSTRACT
A plasma computer numerically controlled (CNC) cutting machine is disclosed that is
controlled by a computer such as a personal computer capable running an operating
system and software programs.       In an embodiment, the computer executes a CNC
program to control movement of a plasma torch to cut parts from a workpiece while a
spectrometer determines emissions spectra of light emitted as the torch cuts the
workpiece.     The spectrometer cooperates with software running on a computer to
analyze the metal as it is being cut by the CNC cutting machine and determine a
composition. The composition is compared to an expected composition and saved in
a database with identifying information.        The database is queried to provide
identifying information of metal having similar composition to the workpiece.

                             AND ASSOCIATED METHODS
FIELD
        [0001]    This disclosure pertains to plasma metal cutting using a numerically
controlled machine and spectral analysis to determine metallurgical composition of
metal.
DEFINITION
        [0002]    In the specification the term "comprising" shall be understood to
have a broad meaning similar to the term "including" and will be understood to imply
the inclusion of a stated integer or step or group of integers or steps but not the
exclusion of any other integer or step or group of integers or steps. This definition
also applies to variations on the term "comprising" such as "comprise" and
"comprises".
BACKGROUND
        [0003]    When purchasing steel from multiple sources, quality of the steel
may not be as dependable and as stable as when purchasing steel from a single
source.      Also, some steel has an unusual composition such as an alloying
component like Boron, which reduces import duty but affects the behavior of the
metal and requires different welding.      When this chemical composition becomes
hidden in the steel supply chain, the steel can be dangerous.
        [0004]    Originally, only chemical analysis could determine metallurgical
components of the steel, and specialty steel suppliers employed metallurgists with
laboratory equipment to test the steel. With the rapid availability of high performance
microcomputers, heavy stand-alone machines use an arc for spectrographic analysis
of a metal sample.          Newer test equipment uses Energy Dispersive X-ray
Fluorescence (ED-XRF) technology for spectral analysis of steel, although they are
expensive and not practical for steel processing workshops.

        [0005]    Plasma cutters are known for metalworking, including working with
steel, aluminum, and other metals.      In plasma cutting, a plasma formed of a gas
heated by an electric arc serves to conduct electricity into, and remove melted metal
from, a metal workpiece. Plasma cutters may be used with "numerically controlled"
(NC), computer controlled cutting machines, or may be handheld.
        [0006]    The reference to prior art in the background above is not and should
not be taken as an acknowledgment or any form of suggestion that the referenced
prior art forms part of the common general knowledge in Australia or in any other
country.
SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE

system and software programs.      In an embodiment, the computer executes a CNC
program to control movement of a plasma torch to cut parts from a workpiece while a
spectrometer determines emissions spectra of light emitted as the torch cuts the
workpiece.    The spectrometer cooperates with software running on a computer to
analyze the metal as it is being cut by the CNC cutting machine and determine a
composition.     In embodiments, the composition is compared to an expected
composition and saved in a database with identifying information; in a particular
embodiment the database is queried to provide identifying information of metal having
similar composition to the workpiece
        [0008]    In an embodiment, a method for analyzing composition of a

plasma cutting head apparatus mounted to the gantry, and a computer having a
processor and memory storing CNC control software having instructions executable
by the processor to control the gantry and the plasma cutting head apparatus to cut
the workpiece with a plasma arc, has improvements including a lens positioned and
configured to capture light from the plasma arc and direct the light through an optical
path; a spectrometer configured to analyze light received through the optical path and

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
         [0016]   FIG. 1 shows an example metal analyzing plasma CNC cutting
machine 100.       Similar to conventional plasma cutting machines, machine 100
includes a bed 140, a gantry 150, and a head apparatus 125 that holds and
manipulates a plasma torch 120. A computer 135 (e.g., a personal computer capable
running an operating system and software programs) communicates with a remote
amplifier box 137 that generates signals through cable 130 for controlling servo
motors of gantry 150, head apparatus 125, and plasma torch 120.             A metallic
workpiece 110 to be cut by machine 100 is placed on bed 140.        In the example of
FIG. 1, workpiece 110 is a steel grating but may represent any metallic material that
may be cut by machine 100 such as steel, aluminum, or brass sheet or plate up to six
inches thick.
         [0017]   In certain embodiments, head apparatus 125 may be a bevel head
apparatus such as can be found in Patent 8,865,056, which is included herein by
reference for purpose of enablement. Bevel head apparatus 125 holds, swivels and
tilts torch 120 up to 57 degrees in any plane. Bevel head apparatus 125 includes a
pantograph arm 127 that is mounted to an actuator box 128 that contains motors and
drivers that manipulate the pantograph arm and plasma torch 120 to cut workpiece
110. Actuator box 128 is formed of metal and acts as a 'Faraday cage' to shield
electronics included therein from radiation and heat generated by the plasma arc.
Box 128 may be cooled in some embodiments, such as by fans.
         [0018]   In a particular embodiment, plasma torch 120 is initiated by 5,000
volts at a frequency of 2 MHz that ionizes gas released in a high pressure stream to
form a plasma arc with a temperature of around 10,000C.      This plasma arc draws a
DC current of between 10 amps and 1200 amps at around 150 volts once
established.     The power released by the plasma arc may reach 180 kW and is
                                            4

typically around 37 kW, and is sufficient to melt thick steel quickly using only
electricity and air (although other gas mixes may be used).         The plasma arc and
melting steel is hot and emits light that carries a wealth of spectral information about
the steel being cut, particularly in the electromagnetic spectrum range of Ultra Violet
(UV) light.
        [0019]    The plasma arc creates a difficult environment for electronic devices,
as it is very hot, splatters molten metal, and its arc-formation power supply of 5,000
volts at a frequency of 2 MHz, generates considerable electromagnetic radiation that
interferes with nearby electronic devices. It is therefore difficult to position sensitive
electronic equipment near plasma torch 120.
        [0020]     A fiber optic cable allows the sensing electronics to be safely
isolated inside a metal Faraday cage while continuously collecting light from the
plasma arc.       The Faraday cage shields the sensing electronics from                the
electromagnetic radiation (radio interference) and heat generated by the plasma arc.
        [0021]    Thus, by combining the spectral analyzer, coupled by the fiber optic
to the plasma CNC cutting machine, emissions spectra from the metallurgic
components of the steel being cut may be monitored periodically or continuously, and
those emissions spectra analyzed to determine metallurgic components of the steel
being cut. This analysis is similar to the analysis done for spark analysis which also
uses an electric arc to generate light to determine a composition of a metal sample.
However, the advantages of machine 100 include that the analysis takes no
additional time or effort beyond that needed to cut the workpiece 110.
        [0022]     Pantograph arm 127 is modified to include a lens 182, positioned to
capture electromagnetic radiation, particularly in the ultraviolet light portion of the
spectrum, from the plasma arc formed by plasma torch 120 while the plasma arc is
cutting workpiece 110.      For example, lens 182 has a focal length based upon its
position relative to the plasma arc, to capture light (i.e., at least a portion of the
electromagnetic spectrum) generated by the plasma arc. An optical path 184, which
may be a single strand or a multiple-strand fiber optic cable, optically couples lens
182 to a spectrometer 180 positioned within box 128. Thus, spectrometer 180 is
                                             5

protected from interference from the plasma arc but receives light emitted from the
plasma arc, via lens 182 and optical path 184, while cutting workpiece 110.
Spectrometer 180 is selected based upon the spectral ranges of light produced by the
plasma arc of the cutting torch as known in the art of spectral analysis.        In one
example, spectrometer 180 is a Blue-Wave Miniature Fiber Optic Spectrometer
device from StellarNet Inc., however, other spectrometer devices may be used
without departing from the scope hereof.
        [0023]    Spectrometer 180 is communicatively coupled to computer 135 via a
communication cable 186, such as an electrically screened cable or a fiber-optic
communications cable. Spectrometer 180 may share a communication path between
bevel head apparatus 125 and computer 135 without departing from the scope
hereof.    In one particular embodiment, communication cable 186 is a USB cable.
Computer 135 includes software 188 that processes data received from spectrometer
180 to determine metallurgical content of workpiece 110 based upon a spectrum
captured by spectrometer 180 while workpiece 110 is being cut by machine 100.
        [0024]    FIG. 2 shows bevel head apparatus 125 of metal analyzing plasma
CNC cutting machine 100 of FIG. 1 in further exemplary detail.             Lens 182 is
positioned on a lower armature 230 of pantograph arm 127 in alignment 238 with a
plasma arc 210 formed by plasma torch 120.         As such, the position of lens 182
relative to the plasma arc 210 is constant, since, due to the advantages of the
pantograph design, the center of plasma arc 210 does not move relative to lower
armature 230. Further, as plasma torch 120 is moved to cut workpiece 110, lens 182
remains in a constant position relative to plasma arc 210. That is, lens 182 is
positioned on the arm supporting plasma torch 120 and moves with the torch. When
other forms of cutting head are used instead of bevel head apparatus 125, lens 182 is
similarly positioned to ensure that lens 182 is aligned with plasma arc 210, and
remains in close proximity to the plasma arc to capture light from the plasma arc while
excluding most surrounding ambient light, and moves as the plasma arc moves to cut
workpiece 110.     For example, as bevel head apparatus 125 moves up and down
relative to a backplane 250, which in turn moves left and right relative to gantry 150,
                                           6

which in turn moves backwards and forwards relative to bed 140, lens 182 remains
aligned with, and in close proximity to, plasma arc 210.
        [0025]    Optical path 184 conveys the light captured by lens 182 to
spectrometer 180 that spectrally analyzes the light to generate spectral data 181.
Spectral data 181 is for example a digital representation of spectral content of the
light captured by lens 182 from plasma arc 210. Lens 182 moves together with bevel
head apparatus 125 as torch 120 is controlled to cut workpiece 110 and spectrometer
180 is positioned a safe distance from plasma arc 210 and couples via optical path
184.
        [0026]    As shown in FIG. 2, lens 182 is positioned at a distal end of lower
armature 230 to capture at least part of the electromagnetic spectrum generated by
plasma arc 210 as it cuts workpiece 110. Lens 182 may include a front element or
window that is replaceable in the event of damage caused by plasma arc 210 or
splattered molten metal. Optical path 184 may be positioned within lower armature
230 for protection from damage by plasma arc 210 and is for example a flexible fiber
optical cable that conveys light from lens 182 to spectrometer 180. In an alternative
embodiment, optical path 184 lies within a tubular conduit to protect it from damage.
Spectrometer 180 is for example a micro spectrometer that uses a diffraction grating
and sensing array to derive spectral data 181 from the light received via optical path
184, the spectral data includes an intensity and wavelength (or equivalently
frequency) distribution of light generated by plasma arc 210.    Spectral data 181 is
sent to computer 135 for further analysis.
        [0027]    FIG. 3 shows computer 135 in further example detail. Computer 135
includes at least one processor 302 communicatively coupled to memory 304.
Memory 304 is non-transitory and represents one or both of volatile memory (e.g.,
RAM, SRAM, DRAM, and so on) and nonvolatile memory (e.g., ROM, PROM,
EPROM, FLASH, magnetic media and optical media). Memory 304 is shown storing
software 188 that includes an operating system 310, a CNC controller 320 function,
and a spectral analyzer 330 routine.       Operating system 310 provides a real-time
multitasking environment within computer 135 for concurrently executing CNC
                                             7

controller 320 and spectral analyzer 330. Operating system 310 is selected from the
group including Microsoft@ WindowsTM, Apple@ OSTM, and so on.            For example,
operating system 310 coordinates execution of CNC controller 320 and spectral
analyzer 330.
        [0028]    CNC controller 320 follows a CNC program 322 to control movement
and operation of plasma torch 120 to cut parts from workpiece 110 as desired. For
example, CNC controller 320 may send commands, via CNC control interface 324
and remote amplifier box 137, to each of gantry 150, bevel head apparatus 125 and
plasma torch 120. As known in the art of CNC controllers, CNC controller 320, gantry
150, and bed 140 are configured so that CNC controller 320 can direct movement of
gantry 150 along bed 140, and of bevel head apparatus 125 along gantry 150,
thereby permitting CNC controller 320 to move bevel head apparatus 125 to position
plasma torch 120 at any X-Y coordinate in a predefined operational area lying within a
plane over and parallel to bed 140. Similarly, CNC controller 320 is configured to
control motors within box 128 to operate pantograph arm 127 to position plasma torch
120 at any Z or height coordinate within a predefined operational volume
incorporating the plane over and parallel to bed 140.       CNC controller is thereby
configured to position torch 120 at any position within the predefined operational
volume as needed to make preprogrammed cuts to workpiece 110.
        [0029]    Operating system 310 runs spectral analyzer 330 concurrently with
CNC controller 320 to process spectral data 181, received via interface 308 and
communication     cable 186 from spectrometer       180, and generate determined
composition 334. CNC controller 320 and spectral analyzer 330 may communicate
such that spectral analyzer 330 controls spectrometer 180 to capture spectral data
181 only when plasma torch 120 is active and plasma arc 210 is present.
        [0030]    In one example of operation, CNC controller 320 and spectral
analyzer 330 cooperate to capture spectral data 181, the spectral data including
emissions spectra information, from different areas of cut of workpiece 110 as it is cut
by machine 100, and spectral analyzer 330 generates determined compositions 334
for each different area of cut.
                                           8

         [0031]     For purposes of this document, a composition of a metal workpiece,
such as workpiece 110, is a list of elements that may be found in metal workpieces
together with a percentage of each element of the list that is present in the workpiece.
For example metal workpieces of cast iron, steel, aluminum, brass, bronze, or copper
may contain aluminum, arsenic, beryllium, bismuth, boron, carbon, cerium, chromium,
copper, iron, lead, magnesium, manganese, molybdenum, nickel, phosphorous,
silicon, silver, sulfur, tin, titanium, tungsten, vanadium, zinc, and zirconium at various
percentages. It is well known that percentages of each element present in a metal
workpiece may dramatically affect physical properties such as hardness of the
workpiece, as well as chemical properties like corrosion resistance, for example
hardness of steel is significantly affected by carbon percentage content, and
corrosion resistance by chromium, and nickel percentage content. Similarly, copper
based alloys have physical properties that are significantly affected by tin, zinc, and
aluminum percentages. Generally, emissions spectra of each element in isolation are
known. Emissions spectral data 181 includes a superposition of emissions spectra of
the elements included in a composition of workpiece 110.
         [0032]     Various bodies, including the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE)
and ASTM International, have published named specifications for metal, such as SAE
grade 440 steel, ASTM Al for railroad rails, ASTM A182 for stainless steel pipe
fittings, A354 for steel alloy bolts, and A514 for weldable steel plate; each
specification includes a range of allowable percentages of specific elements for
composition of metal acceptable under the specification as well as other factors, such
as heat treatments, used in producing metal objects to meet the specification. Other
specifications, such as for rifle barrels, armor plate and bolts, screws, and sheetmetal
used in aircraft construction, have been published by governmental and military
agencies. These specifications may be referenced by those who order metal from
foundries.
         [0033]     In each specification, some elements are regarded as desired,
mandatory, alloy constituents, such as iron and carbon in steel, typically added
intentionally when workpieces are made at a foundry and for which associated
                                                9

percentages appear in specifications as ranges with non-zero minimum                   and
maximum values. Other elements, such as excessive boron or sulfur in steel, may be
regarded as objectionable impurities, with only a maximum                listed for some
specifications, but are sometimes present in workpieces. Still other elements, such
as rare earth elements or actinide series elements, may be present in trace amounts,
their percentages in composition of workpieces is useful in fingerprinting workpieces
even though they may not be listed in common specifications and may be at
sufficiently low concentrations that they do not significantly alter material properties of
the workpiece.
        [0034]     Spectral  analyzer    330   includes    include    machine     readable
instructions that, when executed, perform methods known in the art for identifying
peaks in spectral data 181 and fit known emissions spectra of each element of a
composition of workpiece 110 to observed emissions spectra, thereby identifying
percentages of each element in workpiece 110 and determining determined
composition 334 of workpiece 110. While percentages of most elements in workpiece
110 can be identified using air as the gas from which the plasma is formed, in some
embodiments an inert gas such as argon is used as the supplied gas so that
percentages of oxygen and nitrogen in the workpiece 110 can be determined during
cutting.
        [0035]     In some embodiments, an expected composition 352 of workpiece
110 is defined prior to cutting of workpiece 110.            In embodiments, expected
composition 352 includes ranges of acceptable content for particular elements. In a
particular embodiment, this desired composition is entered into computer 135 as
expected composition 352. In an alternative embodiment, a specification identifier is
entered into computer 135, whereupon computer 135 queries a database 139 on a
server 136, which returns expected composition ranges from a specification entry 141
of database 139 to computer 135 as expected composition 352.                     In either
embodiment, once cutting of workpiece 110 by machine 100 starts, spectral analyzer
330 determines determined composition 334 from light of plasma arc 210, and
compares the determined composition 334 to expected composition 352, generating
                                            10

an alert 354 when determined composition 334 indicates that workpiece 110 is not of
the expected composition 352. For example, spectral analyzer 330 and computer
135 may be configured to ignore variations in composition that are within limits of a
specification or to ignore other minor variations in composition, and/or may be
configured to generate alert 354 when unwanted contaminants are identified in
workpiece 110 or determined composition lies outside limits of a specific specification.
        [0036]    Computer 135 may also include a user interface 350 for interacting
with an operator of machine 100, and user interface 350 may display one or both of
determined composition 334 and alerts 354 to the operator as machine 100 cuts
workpiece 110.
        [0037]     In an embodiment, computer 135 is coupled through a computer
network 138, which in a particular embodiment is a local network and in another
particular embodiment is the Internet, to server 136 having steel composition
information in database 139.
        [0038]     In embodiments having database 139, database 139 may be
configured with specification entries 141 for each of several specifications of metal,
such as steel, with composition ranges for each specification.              In a particular
embodiment, database 139 is configured with a table of acceptable compositions,
typically entered as ranges of percentages for each of several elements, indexed by
published specification identifiers.
        [0039]     In embodiments having database 139, database 139 may also be
configured with composition database entries 143 having determined compositions,
or fingerprints, for metal of each of several specifications as produced by each of
several foundries.     These determined compositions may be measured by plasma
cutting machines herein described, or determined by spectrometric analysis with
other equipment.        In embodiments having composition database entries 143,
computer 135 is configured to upload a determined composition 334 of each
workpiece 110 to database 139 as an additional composition database entry 143 with
any identified specification and identification of the foundry or steel mill the workpiece
originated from.
                                             11

        [0040]     It is known that iron ore varies in composition from mine to mine, and
that impurities found in ore may appear in smelted metal. For example, iron ore from
the Dannemora mine in Sweden was low in phosphorus and sulfur, while high in
certain other metals; during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries cast iron
cannon made from Dannemora ore developed a reputation as being much less likely
to explode when fired than cannon made from iron ore from many other sources
because of the ore's low sulfur and phosphorous content. While major impurities and
amounts of alloying elements, including sulfur and phosphorous, are often corrected
during modern smelting and foundry operations, other, minor, alloying elements and
impurities may not be corrected and will show as minor elements in determined
composition 334. Typically, major impurities and alloying elements are associated
with a specification of metal in workpiece 11, while minor elements in workpiece 110
are associated with a source from which the workpiece originated. The pattern of
these impurities in determined compositions in database 139 can therefore serve to
help identify a source for the workpiece.
        [0041]     In an embodiment, after determining determined composition 334,
computer 135 and server 136 are configured to search database 139 for composition
database entries 143 most closely matching in major alloying elements to determined
composition 334 and provide identifying information to a user regarding specifications
associated with those nearest composition entries. Further, computer 135 and server
136 are configured to search database 139 for composition database entries 143
most closely matching in minor elements to determined composition 334 and provide
a fingerprint identifying information to a user regarding a likely source of metal in
workpiece 110.        For example, for a stainless steel workpiece, iron, nickel and
chromium are major alloying elements added with percentages greater than one
percent during foundry operations and are indicative of a specification for the
stainless steel, while certain other elements of determined composition 334 are
typically not intentionally added and their concentrations are part of the fingerprint for
identifying a source of the metal in workpiece 110.

        [0042]    FIG. 4 shows one example spectral data 181 captured by metal
analyzing plasma CNC cutting machine 100 of FIG.1 when cutting workpiece 110. In
this example, workpiece 110 is stainless steel and contains molybdenum and spectral
data 181 shows a plurality of spectral features 402 that correspond to the presence of
molybdenum in steel. Determined composition 334 may be generated from spectral
data 181 near instantly as spectral data 181 is sent to computer 135 as machine 100
cuts workpiece 110. Determined composition 334 shows the constituent elements of
workpiece 110 in proportion.    For steel, a major constituent is Iron (Fe), but it may
include other constituents such as Chromium for stainless, Carbon, Molybdenum,
Vanadium, Titanium, and Boron, and may also include impurities such as Sulfur and
other elements.    By providing machine 100 with simultaneous cutting and spectral
analysis capability, the operator may verify that workpiece 110 is of correct
composition and is warned of unwanted impurities or unexpected presence of critical
alloying elements such as Boron. Being aware of unexpected composition at the first
cut of workpiece 110 saves potentially wasted time in cutting and attempting to weld
steel contaminated with Boron, for example.       Spectral analysis of each workpiece
also prevents unexpected reduction in finished item quality.
        [0043]    FIG. 5 is a flowchart illustrating one example method 500 for
analyzing metal using metal analyzing plasma CNC cutting machine 100 of FIG. 1.
Method 500 is implemented by lens 182, optical path 184, spectrometer 180, and
computer 135 of machine 100.       In this example, method 500 starts when machine
100 is about to cut, or has started cutting workpiece 110. If not already entered, a
specification or desired composition of material of the workpiece is optionally entered
501 into computer 135. If a specification name is entered, in step 503, computer 135
is configured to access a corresponding specification entry 141 in database 139 of
server 136 and fetch an expected composition database entry 143 from database 139
into local expected composition 352.
        [0044]    Step 502 is a decision. If, in step 502, method 500 determines that
the arc has been ignited, method 500 continues with step 504; otherwise, method 500
continues with step 518.      In one example of step 502, spectral analyzer 330
                                            13

cooperates with CNC controller 320 to determine whether plasma arc 210 is
operating on plasma torch 120.     In another example of step 502, spectral analyzer
330 processes spectral data 181 to determine when plasma arc 210 is operating.
       [0045]     In step 504, method 500 captures light from the plasma arc. In one
example of step 504, lens 182 captures light from plasma arc 210 and optical path
184 conveys the light to spectrometer 180.       In step 506, method 500 generates
spectral data from the light.     In one example of step 506, spectrometer 180
generates, using a diffraction grating and sensors, spectral data 181 from light
captured by lens 182.
       [0046]     In step 508, method 500 processes the spectral data and generates
a determined composition. In one example of step 508, spectral analyzer 330 is
executed by processor 302 to process spectral data 181 and generate determined
composition 334.
       [0047]    Step 510 is optional. If included, in step 510, method 500 displays
the determined composition of step 508 to an operator. In one example of step 510,
spectral analyzer 330 displays determined composition 334 on user interface 350 of
computer 135.
       [0048]    Step 511 is optional. If included, in step 511, method 500 logs the
determined composition as an entry in the database. In one example of step 511,
spectral analyzer 330 logs determined composition 334 as specification entry 141 of
database 139.
       [0049]    Steps 512 through 516 are also collectively optional. If included, in
step 512, method 500 compares the determined composition 334 to an expected
composition 352 of the workpiece. Step 514 is a decision. If, in step 514, method
500 determines that the determined composition and the expected composition match
to within limits, method 500 continues with step 518; otherwise, method 500
continues with step 516.
       [0050]     In step 516, method 500 generates an alert indicating unexpected
composition. In one example of step 516, spectral analyzer 330 generates alert 354
                                          14

and displays alert 354 on user interface 350. Method 500 then continues with step
517.
         [0051]    Steps 517 and 519 are optional. In step 517, method 500 inspects
composition database entries 143 to determine a closest match of the determined
composition 334 to determined composition portions of pre-existing database entries,
first for major constituents to identify a specification of metal in the workpiece, and
second for minor constituents to identify a source mill or foundry from which the metal
originated. Then, in step 519, method 500 displays information, such as a SAE or
ASTM specification name, and/or a foundry name, regarding the database entries
that have the closest matches to the determined composition 334.
         [0052]    Step 518 is optional. If included, in step 518, method 500 waits. In
one example of step 518, the wait is the predefined delay before repeating step 502.
In another example of step 518, the wait is until plasma torch 120 moves to cut a
different area of workpiece 110. Method 500 then continues with step 502. Steps
502 through 518 thus repeat to determine composition of workpiece 110 using
spectral analysis as workpiece 110 is cut by plasma arc 210.
         [0053]    By combining spectral analysis and plasma CNC cutting in a single
machine (i.e., metal analyzing plasma CNC cutting machine 100), one or more of the
following advantages are achieved:
        *   Spectral data is captured from the plasma arc as it cuts the workpiece,
            thereby avoiding the need for creating a separate arc or to use a laser to
            capture spectral data. This also avoids additional damage to the workpiece
            as would be needed for a separate test.
        *   The optical fiber path allows the spectral capture device to be positioned
            away from the plasma arc to reduce interference.
        e   Where the CNC cutting machine uses a bevel head apparatus, the actuator
            box is available to protect the spectral capture device - no additional
            protective enclosure is needed.
        *   In embodiments, the available processing power of the computer used for
            executing the CNC program and controlling the cutting machine is also
                                             15

           used    to analyze the spectral data          and   generate   the determined
           composition.
        " The combined solution makes valuable and often essential spectral
           analysis readily available, practical, and convenient for each cutting
           operation.
        *   The combined solution is more cost effective than using separate spectral
           analyzing devices.
        *  Automatic composition checks for each workpiece may be performed and
           the operator notified if the workpiece is of incorrect composition.
        *  The combined solution provides information to control quality and prevent
           wrong materials from being used or supplied in a field where two quite
           different types of steel can look identical in a steel workshop.
