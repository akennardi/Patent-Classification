           VARIABLY CONFIGURABLE WELLBORE JUNCTION ASSEMBLY
         The present application is a divisional application from Australian Patent
Application No. <removed-apn>, which is a divisional application of Australian patent
Application No. 2012262775, the entire disclosure of both applications of which are
incorporated herein by reference.
                                    TECHNICAL FIELD
         This disclosure relates generally to equipment utilized and operations performed
in conjunction with a subterranean well and, in an example described below, more
particularly provides a variably configurable junction assembly for a branched wellbore.
                                      BACKGROUND
         The following discussion of the background to the invention is intended to
facilitate an understanding of the invention. However, it should be appreciated that the
discussion is not an acknowledgement or admission that any aspect of the discussion
was part of the common general knowledge as at the priority date of the application.
         A wellbore junction provides for connectivity in a branched or multilateral
wellbore. Such connectivity can include sealed fluid communication and/or access
between certain wellbore sections.
         Unfortunately, a typical wellbore junction's configuration (e.g., sealed fluid
communication and/or access between certain wellbore sections) cannot be changed
to suit particular well       circumstances.    Therefore,   it will be appreciated    that
improvements would be beneficial in the art of configuring wellbore junction
assemblies.
                                         SUMMARY
         According to the present invention there is provided a method of installing a
wellbore junction assembly in a well, the method comprising connecting at least first
and second tubular strings to a first opposite end of a tubular string connector with

                                                2
similarly dimensioned oriented connections, whereby the first and second tubular
strings are interchangeably connectable to the connector by the oriented connections,
connecting a third tubular string to a first female connector on a second opposite end
of the connector and connecting a fourth tubular string to a second female connector
on the second opposite end of the connector, wherein the fourth tubular string is
positioned at least partially within the third tubular string.
        According to the present invention there is also provided a wellbore junction
assembly, comprising at least first and second tubular strings and a tubular string
connector having first and second opposite ends, and each of the first and second
tubular strings being secured to the first opposite end by oriented connections,
whereby each of the first and second tubular strings has a fixed rotational orientation
relative to the connector and that each of the first and second tubular strings are
interchangeably connectable to the connector, wherein a third tubular string is
connected to a first female connector on the second opposite end of the connector,

whereby each of the first and second tubular strings has a fixed rotational orientation
relative to the connector, wherein a third tubular string is connected to the second
opposite end of the connector, wherein a fourth tubular string is connected to the
second opposite end of the connector, wherein the fourth tubular string comprises a
seal bore, and wherein a fifth tubular string is sealingly received in the seal bore.
        According to the present invention there is also provided a well system,
comprising a tubular string connector having first and second opposite ends first and
second tubular strings secured to the first opposite end, the first and second tubular
strings being disposed in separate intersecting wellbore sections third and fourth

                                              3
disposed within the third tubular string a first flow control device which selectively
permits and prevents fluid flow through a longitudinal flow passage of the third tubular
string and a second flow control device which selectively permits and prevents fluid
flow through a longitudinal flow passage of the fourth tubular string.
        In the disclosure below, apparatus and methods are provided which bring
improvements to the art of configuring wellbore junction assemblies. One example is
described below in which a wellbore junction assembly can be selectively configured to
permit access to one or another of multiple tubular strings connected to a connector.

                                              5
                                DETAILED DESCRIPTION
        Representatively illustrated in FIG. 1 is a well system 10 and associated method
which can embody principles of this disclosure. In the well system 10, a wellbore
junction 12 is formed at an intersection of three wellbore sections 14, 16,18.
        In this example, the wellbore sections 14, 16 are part of a "parent" or main
wellbore, and the wellbore section 18 is a "lateral" or branch wellbore extending
outwardly from the main wellbore. In other examples, the wellbore sections 14, 18
could form a main wellbore, and the wellbore section 16 could be a branch wellbore. In
further examples, more than three wellbore sections could intersect at the wellbore
junction 12, the wellbore sections 16, 18 could both be branches of the wellbore
section 14, etc. Thus, it should be understood that the principles of this disclosure are
not limited at all to the particular configuration of the well system 10 and wellbore
junction 12 depicted in FIG. 1 and described herein.
        In one unique feature of the well system 10, a wellbore junction assembly 20 is
installed in the wellbore sections 14, 16, 18 to provide controlled fluid communication
and access between the wellbore sections. The assembly 20 includes a tubular string
connector 22, tubular strings 24, 26 attached to an end 28 of the connector, and a
tubular string 30 attached to an opposite end 32 of the connector.
        In this example, the connector 22 provides sealed fluid communication between
the tubular string 30 and each of the tubular strings 24, 26. In addition, physical access
is provided through the connector 22 between the tubular string 30 and one of the
tubular strings 24, 26. The tubular string 24 or 26 to which access is provided is
determined by connecting the tubular strings to certain respective ones of oriented
connections, as described more fully below.
        Such access can allow a well tool 34 (such as a shifting tool, running tool,
retrieving tool, etc.) to be conveyed through the connector 22 and into one of the
tubular strings 24, 26, for example, to operate a valve or other flow control device 36
which controls flow longitudinally through a tubular string 40 in the wellbore section 16,
or to operate a valve or other flow control device 38 which controls flow between the
wellbore 18 and an interior of the tubular string 26, etc. Access through the connector
22 may be used for purposes other than operating flow control devices, in keeping with
the scope of this disclosure.

                                              6
        In the example depicted in FIG. 1, the wellbore sections 14, 16 are lined with
casing 42 and cement 44, but the wellbore section 18 is uncased or open hole. A
window 46 is formed through the casing 42 and cement 44, with the wellbore section
 18 extending outwardly from the window.
        However, other completion methods and configurations may be used, if desired.
For example, the wellbore section 18 could be lined, with a liner therein being sealingly
connected to the window 46 or other portion of the casing 42, etc. Thus, it will be
appreciated that the scope of this disclosure is not limited to any of the features of the
well system 10 or the associated method described herein or depicted in the drawings.
       A deflector 48 is secured in the casing 42 at the junction 12 by a packer, latch or
other anchor 50. The tubular string 40 is sealingly secured to the anchor 50 and
deflector 48, so that a passage 52 in the tubular string 40 is in communication with a
passage 54 in the deflector 48.
        The tubular string 24 is engaged with seals 56 in the deflector 48, so that the
tubular string 24 is in sealed communication with the tubular string 40 in the wellbore
section 16.
       A bull nose 58 on a lower end of the tubular string 26 is too large to fit into the
passage 54 in the deflector 48 and so, when the junction assembly 20 is lowered into
the well, the bull nose 58 is deflected laterally into the wellbore section 18. The tubular
string 24, however, is able to fit into the passage 54 and, when the junction assembly
20 is appropriately positioned as depicted in FIG. 1, the tubular string 24 will be in
sealed communication with the tubular string 40 via the passage 54.
        In the example of FIG. 1, fluids (such as hydrocarbon fluids, oil, gas, water,
steam, etc.) can be produced from the wellbore sections 16, 18 via the respective
tubular strings 24, 26. The fluids can flow via the connector 22 into the tubular string 30
for eventual production to the surface.
        However, such production is not necessary in keeping with the scope of this
disclosure. In other examples, fluid (such as steam, liquid water, gas, etc.) could be
injected into one of the wellbore sections 16, 18 and another fluid (such as oil and/or
gas, etc.) could be produced from the other wellbore section, fluids could be injected
into both of the wellbore sections 16, 18, etc. Thus, any type of injection and/or

                                               7
production operations can be performed in keeping with the principles of this
disclosure.
        Referring additionally now to FIG. 2, a partially cross-sectional view of the
wellbore junction assembly 20 is representatively illustrated, apart from the remainder
of the system 10. In this example, a fluid 60 is produced from the wellbore section 16
via the tubular string 24 to the connector 22, and another fluid 62 is produced from the
wellbore section 18 via the tubular string 26 to the connector. The fluids 60, 62 may be
the same type of fluid (e.g., oil, gas, steam, water, etc.), or they may be different types
of fluids.
        The fluid 62 flows via the connector 22 into another tubular string 64 positioned
within the tubular string 30. The fluid 60 flows via the connector 22 into a space 65
formed radially between the tubular strings 30, 64.
        Chokes or other types of flow control devices 66, 68 can be used to variably
regulate the flows of the fluids 60, 62 into the tubular string 30 above the tubular string
64. The devices 66, 68 may be remotely controllable by wired or wireless means (e.g.,
by acoustic, pressure pulse or electromagnetic telemetry, by optical waveguide,
electrical conductor or control lines, etc.), allowing for an intelligent completion in which
production from the various wellbore sections can be independently controlled.
        Although the fluids 60, 62 are depicted in FIG. 2 as being commingled in the
tubular string 30 above the tubular string 64, it will be appreciated that the fluids could
remain segregated in other examples. In addition, although the device 68 is illustrated
as possibly obstructing a passage 70 through the tubular string 64, in other examples
the device 68 could be positioned so that it effectively regulates flow of the fluid 62
without obstructing the passage.
        In one example, physical access is provided between the passage 70 and the
interior of the tubular string 26 (as depicted in FIG. 2), or the interior of the tubular
string 24, depending on how the tubular strings 24, 26 are connected to the connector
22. Thus, an item of equipment (such as the well tool 34) can pass from the tubular
string 30 into the tubular string 64, through the passage 70 to the connector 22, and
via the connector into the tubular string 26, or into the tubular string 24.
        Referring additionally now to FIG. 3, an enlarged scale cross-sectional view of
the tubular string connector 22 is representatively illustrated. In this view, it may be

                                              8
seen that the connector 22 is provided with connections 72, 74 at one end 28, and
connections 76, 78 at the opposite end 32.
       The tubular strings 24, 26 are connected to the connector 22 by the connections
72, 74. The tubular strings 30, 64 are connected to the connector 22 by the respective
connections 76, 78. Preferably, each of the connections 72, 74, 76, 78 in this example
comprises an internal thread in the connector 22, but other types of connections may
be used, if desired.
       The connections 72, 74 are preferably of the type known to those skilled in the
art as premium oriented threads. One suitable oriented thread is the VAM(TM) "FJL"
oriented thread, although other oriented threads and other types of oriented
connections may be used and remain within the scope of this disclosure. Other types
of oriented connections could include J-slots, etc.
       The oriented connections 72, 74 fix a rotational orientation of each of the tubular
strings 24, 26 relative to the connector 22. In addition, if the oriented connections 72,
74 are identically (or at least similarly) dimensioned, then each of the tubular strings
24, 26 can be connected to the connector 22 by either one of the oriented connections.
       The dimensions of the connections 72, 74 are similar if this interchangeability of
the tubular strings 24, 26 is permitted. Thus, one of the connections 72, 74 could be
somewhat different from the other of the connections, and yet the connections 72, 74
can still be similarly dimensioned, if each tubular string 24, 26 can be operatively
connected to the connector 22 by either one of the connections.
       When used in the wellbore junction assembly 20 of FIGS. 1 & 2, the tubular
string 64 could be connected to the connection 78, for example, by threading. The
connection 78 may comprise an oriented connection, if desired. The tubular string 30
could be connected to the connection 76, for example, by threading. The connection
76 may comprise an oriented connection, if desired.
       With the tubular string 64 connected to the connection 78, physical access is
provided between the interior of the tubular string 64 and the interior of the tubular
string 24 or 26 connected to the connection 74. In the example of FIG. 1, the well tool
34 can be conveyed through the tubular string 30 to the top of the tubular string 64,
through the tubular string 64 to the connector 22, and through the connector into the
tubular string 24.

                                              9
        In this example, the tubular string 24 would be connected to the connector 22
via the connection 74. Alternatively, the tubular string 26 could be connected to the
connector 22 via the connection 74, in which case the well tool 34 could be conveyed
from the tubular string 30 into the tubular string 64, and through the connector into the
tubular string 26 (for example, to operate the flow control device 38).
        The choice of which of the tubular strings 24, 26 can be physically accessed
through the connector 22 is made prior to installing the junction assembly 20 in the
well. The use of the similarly dimensioned connections 72, 74 ensures that the tubular
string 24 can be connected to the connector 22 by either one of the connections, and
the tubular string 26 can be connected to the connector by the other one of the
connections.
        Furthermore, the use of the oriented connections 72, 74 ensures that the tubular
strings 24, 26 will be properly rotationally oriented relative to the connector 22 when
the tubular strings are connected. This feature is beneficial, for example, so that the
bull nose 58 is properly rotationally oriented for deflection into the wellbore section 18
by the deflector 48, etc.
        Preferably, all threaded connections between the bull nose 58 and the
connector 22 are oriented connections, so that the bull nose is properly rotationally
aligned to deflect laterally off of the deflector 48 when all of the threaded connections
are made up. Alternatively, all of the components of the tubular string 26, except for
the bull nose 58, could be made up, then upper threads on the bull nose could be cut
so that, when the bull nose is made up to the rest of the tubular string, the bull nose
will be properly rotationally aligned.
        Yet another alternative is to make up all of the components of the tubular string
26, other than the bull nose 58 and a pup joint (relatively short tubular section) above
the bull nose. Then, the pup joint (for example, a pup joint between the device 38 and
the bull nose 58) could be selected or custom machined (e.g., with a chosen rotational
offset between its ends), so that when the pup joint and bull nose are assembled to the
remainder of the tubular string 26, the bull nose will be properly rotationally oriented to
deflect laterally off of the deflector 48. The pup joint could be provided with oriented
threads at either or both of its ends.

                                             10
        Referring additionally now to FIGS. 4A-G, selected axial sections of the junction
assembly 20 are representatively illustrated in more detailed cross-sectional views.
The junction assembly 20 may be used in the well system 10 and method of FIG. 1, or
it may be used in other systems and methods, in keeping with the principles of this
disclosure.
        Note that, instead of being connected at a lower end of the tubular string 26, the
bull nose 58 depicted in FIG. 1 may be used to transition between a smaller diameter
upper section of the tubular string and a larger diameter lower section of the tubular
string. The larger diameter lower section of the tubular string 26 could include various
components, e.g., completion components such as sand screens, packers, plugs, liner,
valves, chokes, seal assemblies (for example, to sting into a liner string previously
installed in the wellbore section 18, etc.), control lines (for example, to operate valves,
chokes, etc.), etc. A lower end of the tubular string 26 could include another
component which deflects laterally off of the deflector 48 (similar to the bull nose 58).
The device 38 could be connected in either of the smaller or larger diameter sections
of the tubular string 26 in that case.
        In FIG. 4A, it may be seen that the tubular string 64 is positioned within the
tubular string 30. Another tubular string (indicated as 64a in FIG. 4A) is sealingly
installed in the tubular string 64 and effectively becomes a part thereof. An upper
"scoop head" 80 is provided on the tubular string 64 for convenient insertion of the
tubular string 64a therein while the junction assembly 20 is in the well.
        In this example, the flow control devices 66, 68 of FIG. 2 can be interconnected
in the tubular string 64a. Thus, the tubular string 64a, along with the flow control
devices 66, 68 and other equipment (e.g., telemetry devices, lines, etc.) can be
installed in the junction assembly 20 after the junction assembly has been installed in
the well at the wellbore junction 12. Furthermore, the tubular string 64a, along with the
flow control devices 66, 68 and other equipment, can be conveniently retrieved (e.g.,
for maintenance, repair, replacement, etc.) from the junction assembly 20, if desired.
        In FIG. 4B, it may be seen that seals 82 carried on the tubular string 64a
sealingly engage a seal bore 84 formed in the tubular string 64. Engagement of the
seals 82 in the seal bore 84 provides for sealed fluid communication between an
internal passage 86 of the tubular string 64 and an internal passage 88 of the tubular

                                             11
string 64a. Together, the passages 86, 88 can comprise the passage 70 depicted in
FIG. 2.
        In FIG. 4C, it may be seen that a latch 90 carried on the tubular string 64a
releasably engages an internal profile 92 formed in the tubular string 64. In this
manner, the tubular string 64a is releasably secured in the tubular string 64. The seal
bore 84 and profile 92 may be the same as, or similar to, the type used on
conventional polished bore receptacles well known to those skilled in the art.
        In FIG. 4D, it may be seen that a lower end of the tubular string 64a engages a
shoulder 94 formed in the tubular string 64. This engagement with the shoulder 94
properly positions the tubular string 64a relative to the tubular string 64.
        In FIG. 4E, it may be seen that the passage 86 is laterally offset in the tubular
string 64. This lateral offset is optional (as are the other features of the junction
assembly 20 described herein and depicted in the drawings), but in this example the
offset accommodates a change in wall thickness of the outer tubular string 30, and
positions the tubular string 64 more toward a center of the outer tubular string. The
scoop head 80 (see FIG. 4A) is used to more closely center the top of the tubular
string 64 in the tubular string 30.
        In FIG. 4F, it may be seen that the tubular string 64 is connected to the
connector 22 via the connection 78. The tubular string 30 is connected to the
connector 22 via the connection 76. The tubular string 24 is connected via the
connection 72, and the tubular string 26 is connected via the connection 74. Thus, in
this example, physical access is provided between the tubular string 64 and the tubular
string 26 through the connector 22.
        In FIG. 4G, the configuration of the junction assembly 20 is changed somewhat,
in that the tubular string 24 (instead of the tubular string 26) is connected to the
connector 22 via the connection 74. The tubular string 26 is connected via the
connection 72. Thus, in this configuration, physical access is provided between the
tubular string 64 and the tubular string 24 through the connector 22.
        Referring additionally now to FIGS. 5A-E, detailed cross-sectional views of the
junction assembly 20 as installed in the wellbore sections 14, 16, 18 of the well system
 10 are representatively illustrated. For clarity, the remainder of the well system 10 is
not illustrated in FIGS. 5A-E.

                                               12
         In FIGS. 5A-E, it may be clearly seen how the features of the junction assembly
20 cooperate to provide for a convenient and effective installation in the wellbore
sections 14, 16, 18. Note that the tubular string 64a is not yet installed in the FIGS. 5A
E configuration, and it should be understood that it is not necessary, in keeping with
the scope of this disclosure, for the tubular string 64a to be installed at all.
         Referring additionally now to FIG. 6, a bottom view of the connector 22 is
representatively illustrated. In this view, it may be seen that, if two of the connections
72, 74 are provided at the lower end 28 of the connector 22, then preferably the
connections 72, 74 are oriented 180 degrees relative to one another.
         As depicted in FIG. 6, a feature 96 of the connection 72 which controls the
rotational orientation of a tubular string connected to the connection is indicated with a
small triangle (the triangle represents the position of the feature, rather than the feature
itself). This feature 96 could be a start of a thread, an end of a thread, a portion of a J
slot, etc. Any feature which controls the rotational orientation of a tubular string
connected to the connector 22 by connection 72 may be used as the feature 96.
         The connection 74 has a similar feature 98. Note that the features 96, 98, along
with the remainder of the connections 72, 74, are oriented 180 degrees with respect to
each other. In this manner, a tubular string would be rotated 180 degrees between
being operatively connected to the connector 22 by one of the connections 72, 74, and
being operatively connected by the other of the connections. Of course, other
rotational orientations of the connections 72, 74 may be used, in keeping with the
scope of this disclosure.
         Referring additionally now to FIG. 7, another configuration of the connector 22 is
representatively illustrated. In this configuration, three connections 72, 74, 100 are
provided at the bottom end 28 of the connector 22. The connection 100 may be an
oriented connection, and/or the connection 100 may be similarly dimensioned to the
other connections 72, 74, so that a same tubular string could be connected to any of
the connections 72, 74, 100.
         The example of FIG. 7 demonstrates that any number of connections may be
provided on the connector 22 in keeping with the scope of this disclosure. Additionally,
note that the connections 72, 74, 100 are oriented 120 degrees relative to one another,

                                              13
demonstrating that any orientation of connections may be used in keeping with the
scope of this disclosure.
         The features 96, 98 are differently oriented in the FIG. 7 example, as compared
to the FIG. 6 example. However, the features 96, 98 (and a similar feature 102 of the
connection 100) are preferably also rotationally oriented 120 degrees relative to one
another. This demonstrates that any rotational orientation of features may be used in
keeping with the scope of this disclosure.
        Although in FIGS. 6 & 7 the connections 72, 74, 100 are depicted as being
equally angularly spaced apart, and the features 96, 98, 102 are depicted as being
equally rotationally shifted relative to each other, the scope of this disclosure
encompasses non-equal angular spacing of the connections and non-equal rotational
displacement between the features of the connections.
         Referring additionally now to FIG. 8, another configuration of the wellbore
junction assembly 20 is representatively illustrated. In this configuration, the tubular
string 26 (which is to be deflected laterally into the wellbore section 18) includes a
tubular string support 104 for decreasing bending stress in, and preventing buckling of,
the tubular string 26 during installation.
         The support 104 can be interconnected in the tubular string 26 in various ways.
For example, the support 104 could be provided with threads (such as oriented
threads, or another type of oriented connection) for connection between upper and
lower sections of the tubular string 26, or the support could be slid over the exterior of
the tubular string and secured with set screws, clamps, etc. Thus, it will be appreciated
that any manner of attaching the support 104 to, or interconnecting the support in, the
tubular string 26 may be used in keeping with the scope of this disclosure.
         The support 104 preferably extends at least partially adjacent the other tubular
string 24. For example, the support 104 could at least partially straddle the tubular
string 24 as depicted in FIG. 8.
         Laterally extending "legs" 106 of the support 104 can be configured with various
lateral lengths, which space the tubular string 26 away from elements such as the
deflector 48, the window 46, the wellbore section 18, etc. This spacing away of the
tubular string 26 from such elements functions to reduce bending of the tubular string
as it is being installed in the wellbore section 18, as described more fully below.

                                              14
         In the configuration of FIG. 8, the legs 106 of the support 104 extend to
approximately a maximum outer diameter of the tubular string 24 adjacent the support.
Preferably, the support 104 (including the legs 106) does not extend laterally outward
any more than does the connector 22, so that the support and the tubular strings 24,
26 can pass through the same upper wellbore section 14 during installation.
         Referring additionally now to FIG. 9, a side view of the support 104 is
representatively illustrated at an enlarged scale. In this configuration, the legs 106 do
not extend as far laterally outward as in the FIG. 8 configuration. Thus, the tubular
string 26 will not be spaced as far away from various elements of the well system 10
(e.g., the deflector 48, the window 46, the wellbore section 18, etc.) as compared to
the configuration of FIG. 8 during installation of the junction assembly 20.
         Referring additionally now to FIG. 10, another configuration of the support 104
is representatively illustrated. In this configuration, the legs 106 extend laterally
outward a greater distance as compared to the FIGS. 8 & 9 configurations. Thus, the
tubular string 26 will be spaced farther away from various elements of the well system
10 (e.g., the deflector 48, the window 46, the wellbore section 18, etc.) as compared to
the configuration of FIGS. 8 & 9 during installation of the junction assembly 20.
         Referring additionally now to FIG. 11, yet another configuration of the support
104 is representatively illustrated, apart from the remainder of the junction assembly
20. In this view, the manner in which the legs 106 can straddle the tubular string 24
may be clearly seen.
         Prior to the tubular string 26 being deflected laterally into the wellbore section
18, the tubular string 24 is received in a longitudinal recess 108 formed on the support
104. An opening 110 formed longitudinally through the support 104 can be provided
with oriented connections (such as oriented threads, J-slots, etc.), or the opening can
be large enough to receive the tubular string 26 therein, in which case set screws,
clamps or another means may be used to secure the support onto the tubular string.
         Referring additionally now to FIG. 12, the tubular string 26 is representatively
illustrated as it is being deflected laterally into the wellbore section 18 during
installation of the junction assembly 20. Note that the legs 106 of the support 104
space the tubular string 26 away from the deflector 48 and, upon further installation,
will space the tubular string away from the window 46 and the wellbore section 18.

                                               15
         This spacing away of the tubular string 26 by the support 104 reduces bending
of the tubular string, thereby reducing bending stresses in the tubular string. If an
obstruction or restriction is encountered by the tubular string 26 during installation into
the wellbore section 18, this reduced bending of the tubular string can also prevent
buckling of the tubular string, particularly if additional longitudinal force is applied to the
tubular string (e.g., by setting down weight on the assembly 20, etc.) in order to
traverse the obstruction or restriction.
         Support of the tubular string 26 in this manner can be especially beneficial in
horizontal or substantially deviated wellbore sections, such as the wellbore section 18
as depicted in FIG. 12. In that case, the tubular string 26 can be subjected to the force
of gravity, tending to make the tubular string lie against the deflector 48, window 46
and the lower side of the wellbore section 18 during installation.
         Referring additionally now to FIGS. 13A & B, another configuration of the
wellbore junction assembly 20 is representatively illustrated. In this configuration, a
flow control device 112 in the tubular string 30 above the connector 22 is opened as
the tubular string 64a is installed in the junction assembly 20.
         In FIG. 13A, the flow control device 112 is closed prior to the tubular string 64a
being fully installed in the junction assembly 20. In this configuration, a closure 114 of
the device 112 prevents flow through an internal flow passage 116 of the tubular string
30.
         With flow through the passage 116 being blocked (as depicted in FIG. 13A)
valuable completion fluids, muds, or other fluids are prevented from flowing through
the junction assembly 20 into the wellbore sections 16, 18, where they could be lost to
earth strata surrounding these wellbore sections. If the wellbore sections 16, 18 are
completed in an underbalanced condition, then the device 112 in its closed
configuration can prevent increased pressure above the wellbore junction 20 from
being communicated with the wellbore sections 16, 18, which communication could
otherwise damage the earth strata intersected by the wellbore sections. Elevated
pressure above the device 112 could in some circumstances cause undesired
fracturing or other damage to the earth strata intersected by the wellbore sections 16,
 18, if not for the device being closed.

                                              16
        The device 112 may be of the type known to those skilled in the art as a fluid
loss control device. In FIGS. 13A & B, the device 112 is depicted as a ball valve, with
the closure 114 comprising a rotatable ball. However, in other examples, the device
112 could comprise a flapper valve or other type of openable flow blocking device.
        One suitable flow blocking device is the Anvil(TM) plug marketed by Halliburton
Energy Services, Inc. of Houston, Texas USA, which comprises a shearable closure.
Yet another suitable flow blocking device is the Mirage(TM) disappearing plug, also
marketed by Halliburton Energy Services, Inc., which comprises a dispersible closure.
Therefore, it will be appreciated that any means of blocking flow through the passage
116, and then permitting flow through the passage, may be used in keeping with the
scope of this disclosure.
        In the example of FIGS. 13A & B, the device 112 is opened in response to
installation of the tubular string 64a into the tubular string 30. In this configuration, the
latch 90 complementarily engages the profile 92 (which is formed in a sleeve 118
reciprocably disposed in the tubular string 30) when the tubular string 64a is inserted
into the tubular string 30.
        As depicted in FIG. 13A, the tubular string 64a has been inserted sufficiently far
into the tubular string 30 for the latch 90 to engage the profile 92 in the sleeve 118. As
depicted in FIG. 13B, the tubular string 64a has been further inserted into the tubular
string 30, and the sleeve 118 has thereby been displaced with the tubular string 64a.
        Displacement of the sleeve 118 with the tubular string 64a causes the closure
114 to open, as shown in FIG. 13B. In this example, the closure 114 is rotated to an
open position, but in other examples the closure could be sheared, broken, pivoted,
dissolved or otherwise dispersed, etc., so that flow is permitted through the passage
116.
        After the device 112 is opened, the tubular string 64a can be further inserted
into the tubular string 30, with the latch 90 disengaging the profile 92 (for example, as
a result of applying a sufficient longitudinal force to the tubular string 64a, e.g., by
setting down weight on the tubular string, etc.).
        Referring additionally now to FIGS. 14A & B, a section of the wellbore junction
assembly 20 is representatively illustrated after the tubular string 64a has been

                                              17
inserted further into the junction assembly. More specifically, the tubular string 64a has
been inserted partially into the tubular string 64.
        In FIG. 14A, the tubular string 64a has been inserted sufficiently far into the
tubular string 64 for the latch 90 to complementarily engage another profile 92 of
another flow control device 120 interconnected in the tubular string 64. The flow control
device 120 may be the same as, similar to, or different from the flow control device 112
interconnected in the tubular string 30.
        In this example, the profile 92 is formed in a sleeve 122 which is reciprocably
disposed relative to the passage 86 in the tubular string 64. Displacement of the sleeve
 122 causes opening of a closure 124 of the device 120.
        In FIG. 14B, the closure 124 has been opened, thereby permitting flow through
the passage 86. After the device 120 is opened, the tubular string 64a can be further
inserted into the tubular string 64, with the latch 90 disengaging the profile 92 (for
example, as a result of applying a sufficient longitudinal force to the tubular string 64a,
e.g., by setting down weight on the tubular string, etc.).
        The device 120 in its closed configuration preferably prevents fluid flow between
the wellbore sections 16, 18. With the device 120 closed (as depicted in FIG. 14A),
fluid cannot flow between the space 65 and the passage 86 below the device. Thus, if
the earth strata intersected by the wellbore sections 16, 18 have different formation
pressures, the device 120 in its closed configuration will prevent transfer of fluid from a
higher pressure earth strata to a lower pressure earth strata.
        It can now be seen that insertion of the tubular string 64a into the junction
assembly 20 can be used to open the device 112, and then to open the device 120.
The devices 112, 120 are opened in response to the displacement of the tubular string
64a through the tubular string 30 (thereby opening the device 112), and in response to
displacement of the tubular string 64a through the tubular string 64 (thereby opening
the device 120).
        Opening of the device 112 provides fluid communication between upper and
lower sections of the tubular string 30, and opening of the device 120 provides fluid
communication between upper and lower sections of the tubular string 64. Stated
differently, opening of the device 112 provides fluid communication through an upper
section of the junction assembly 20, and opening of the device 120 provides fluid

                                            18
communication between the tubular strings 24, 26, and between the wellbore sections
16, 18.
         It may now be fully appreciated that this disclosure provides significant
improvements to the art of constructing wellbore junctions. The tubular string
connector 22 described above can be used to determine which of multiple tubular
strings 24, 26 can be physically accessed after installation of the junction assembly 20.
The tubular strings 24, 26 can be interchangeably connected to the connector 22 with
the oriented connections 72, 74.
         The above disclosure describes a method of installing a wellbore junction
assembly 20 in a well. The method can include connecting at least first and second
tubular strings 24, 26 to a first opposite end 28 of a tubular string connector 22 with
similarly dimensioned oriented connections 72, 74, whereby the first and second
tubular strings 24, 26 are interchangeably connectable to the connector 22 with the
oriented connections 72, 74.
         The connecting step can include each of the first and second tubular strings 24,
26 having a rotational orientation relative to the connector 22 which is determined by
the respective oriented connection 72 or 74.
         The method can include orienting the oriented connections 72, 74 on the
connector 180 degrees with respect to each other, and/or substantially equally
angularly spacing the oriented connections apart from each other.
         The method can include connecting a third tubular string 30 to a second
opposite end 32 of the connector 22. The method can also include connecting a fourth
tubular string 64 to the second opposite end 32 of the connector 22. The fourth tubular
string 64 may be positioned at least partially within the third tubular string 30.
        Access may be permitted via the connector 22 between the fourth tubular string
64 and only one of the first and second tubular strings 24, 26.
         The fourth tubular string 64 can comprise a seal bore 84. A fifth tubular string
64a may be sealingly installed in the seal bore 84.
         The method may include opening a flow control device 120 in response to
installing a fifth tubular string 64a in the fourth tubular string 64. Opening the flow

                                              19
control device 120 may comprise permitting fluid communication through a longitudinal
flow passage 86 of the fourth tubular string 64.
         The method may also include opening a second flow control device 112 in
response to installing the fifth tubular string 64a in the third tubular string 30. Opening
the second flow control device 112 may comprise permitting fluid communication
through a longitudinal flow passage 116 of the third tubular string 30.
         The method may include laterally spacing the second tubular string 26 away
from a deflector 48 with a support 104 connected in the second tubular string 26, while
the deflector 48 laterally deflects the second tubular string 26 into a wellbore section
 18. The support 104 may space the second tubular string 26 laterally away from a
lower side of the wellbore section 18.
         The support 104 may at least partially straddle the first tubular string 24 prior to
deflection of the second tubular string 26 into the wellbore section 18. The support 104
may reduce bending of the second tubular string 26 when the second tubular string 26
is installed in the wellbore section 18.
         Also described above is a wellbore junction assembly 20. The junction
assembly 20 can include at least first and second tubular strings 24, 26, and a tubular
string connector 22 having first and second opposite ends 28, 32. Each of the first and
second tubular strings 24, 26 may be secured to the first opposite end 28 by oriented
connections 72, 74, whereby each of the first and second tubular strings 24, 26 has a
fixed rotational orientation relative to the connector 22.
         The above disclosure also provides to the art a well system 10. The well system
 10 can include a tubular string connector 22 having first and second opposite ends 28,
32, first and second tubular strings 24, 26 secured to the first opposite end 28, the first
and second tubular strings 24, 26 being disposed in separate intersecting wellbore
sections 16, 18, third and fourth tubular strings 30, 64 secured to the second opposite
end 32, the fourth tubular string 64 being disposed within the third tubular string 30, a
first flow control device 120 which selectively permits and prevents fluid flow through a
longitudinal flow passage 116 of the third tubular string 30, and a second flow control
device 112 which selectively permits and prevents fluid flow through a longitudinal flow
passage 86 of the fourth tubular string 64.

                                              20
        The first flow control device 120 may open in response to insertion of a fifth
tubular string 64a into the fourth tubular string 64.
        The second flow control device 112 may open in response to insertion of a fifth
tubular string 64a into the third tubular string 30. The first flow control device 120 may
open in response to insertion of the fifth tubular string 64a through the second flow
control device 112 and into the fourth tubular string 64.
        The second flow control device 112 may selectively permit and prevent fluid
communication between the wellbore portions 16, 18. The first flow control device 120
may selectively permit and prevent fluid communication between the wellbore portions
16, 18 and the third tubular string 30.
        Also described above is a well system 10 which can include a tubular string
connector 22 having opposite ends 28, 32, and each of first and second tubular strings
24, 26 being secured to the connector 22, and a support 104 which reduces bending of
the second tubular string 26 which results from deflection of the second tubular string
26 from a first wellbore section 14 into a second wellbore section 18.
        The support 104 may space the second tubular string 26 away from a deflector
48 which deflects the second tubular string 26 into the second wellbore section 18. The
support 104 may space the second tubular string 26 away from a lower side of the
second wellbore section 18.
        The support 104 may at least partially straddle the first tubular string 24.
        The first and second tubular strings 24, 26 can be connected to the same end
28 of the connector 22.
        The first tubular string 24 may be disposed in a third wellbore section 16.
        It is to be understood that the various examples described above may be
utilized in various orientations, such as inclined, inverted, horizontal, vertical, etc., and
