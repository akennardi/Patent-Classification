                  Use of a Dedicated Remote Control as an Intermediary Device to
                         Communicate with an Implantable Medical Device
                                                Abstract
Systems and methods are disclosed in which an external device such as a consumer mobile device
(e.g., smart phone) is used as an external controller to bi-directionally communicate with an
Implantable Medical Device (IMD) using a dedicated patient remote control (RC) as an intermediary
device to translate communications between the two. The dedicated RC contains a graphical user
interface allowing for control and monitoring of the IMD even if the mobile device is not present in
the system, which is useful as a back-up should the mobile device experience problems. Use of the
dedicated RC as an intermediary device broadens the utility of other computing devices to operate as
an external controller for an IMD even if the computing device and IMD do not have compliant
communication means.

                     CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS
[0000]       This application is a divisional of Australian Patent Application No. 2015303967
having a filing date of 2 July 2015. The contents of the aforementioned application is
incorporated herein by reference in entirety.
                                    FIELD OF THE INVENTION
[0001]       The present invention relates generally to implantable medical device systems, and
more particularly to external systems and methods for communicating with an implantable
medical device.
                                            BACKGROUND
[0002]       Implantable stimulation devices deliver electrical stimuli to nerves and tissues for the
therapy of various biological disorders, such as pacemakers to treat cardiac arrhythmia,
defibrillators to treat cardiac fibrillation, cochlear stimulators to treat deafness, retinal
stimulators to treat blindness, muscle stimulators to produce coordinated limb movement,
spinal cord stimulators to treat chronic pain, cortical and deep brain stimulators (DBS) to treat
motor and psychological disorders, and other neural stimulators to treat urinary incontinence,
sleep apnea, shoulder subluxation, etc. The description that follows will generally focus on the
use of the invention within a Spinal Cord Stimulation (SCS) system, such as that disclosed in
U.S. Patent 6,516,227.      However, the present invention may find applicability with any
Implantable Medical Device (IMD) or in any IMD system.
[0003]       As shown in Figure 1, a SCS system includes an Implantable Pulse Generator (IPG)
10 (hereinafter, and more generically, IMD 10), which includes a biocompatible device case 12
formed of titanium for example. The case 12 typically holds the circuitry and battery 14
necessary for the IMD 10 to function. The IMD 10 is coupled to electrodes 16 via one or more
electrode leads 18 (two of which are shown). The proximal ends of the leads 18 are coupled to
the IMD 10 at one or more lead connectors 20 fixed in a header 22, which can comprise an
epoxy for example. In the illustrated embodiment, there are sixteen electrodes, although the
number of leads and electrodes is application specific and therefore can vary. In an SCS
application, two electrode leads 18 are typically implanted on the right and left side of the dura
within the patient's spinal column. The proximal ends of the leads 18 are then tunneled through
the patient's flesh to a distant location, such as the buttocks, where the IMD case 12 is implanted,
at which point they are coupled to the lead connectors 20.

                                          la
[0004] Cross sections of two examples of IMD 10, 10a and 10, are shown in Figures 2A

and 2B. Both contain a charging coil 24 for wirelessly charging the IMD's battery 14 using
an external charging device (not shown). (If battery 14 is not rechargeable, charging coil 26
can be dispensed with). Both IMDs 10a and 10b also contain control circuitry such as a
microcontroller 26, telemetry circuitry 28 (discussed further below), and various components
30 necessary for IMD operation, such as stimulation circuitry for forming therapeutic pulses
at the electrodes 16. The charging coil 24, battery 14, microcontroller 26, telemetry circuitry
28, and other components 30 are electrically coupled to a printed circuit board (PCB) 32.
 [0005]      Different in the two IMDs 10a and 10b are the telemetry antennas 34a and 34b
used to transcutaneously communicate data through the patient's tissue 36 with devices
external to the patient (not shown in Figs. 2A and 2B). In IMD 10a (Fig. 2A), the antenna
comprises a coil 34a, which can bi-directionally communicate with an external device along a
magnetic induction communication link 38a, which comprises a magnetic field of typically
less than 10 MHz operable in its near-field to communicate at a distance of 12 inches or less
for example. Telemetry circuitry 28a is electrically coupled to the coil antenna 34a to enable
it to communicate via magnetic induction link 38a, and generally includes driver circuitry for
energizing the coil antenna 34a to transmit data and amplifier/filter circuitry for resolving
data received at the coil 34. Telemetry circuitry 28a generally also operates in accordance
with a modulation scheme (defining how data to be transmitted is modulated on the link 38a
and will be demodulated when received) and a communication protocol (defining the manner
in which the data is formatted). Telemetry circuitry 28a receives the data to be transmitted in
digital form from the microcontroller 26, and provides received digital data to the
microcontroller 26 for interpretation.       A typical modulation scheme used by telemetry
circuitry 28a is Frequency Shift Keying (FSK), although other modulation schemes could
also be used. In Figure 2A, the external device would also contain communication means
(e.g., a coil antenna; telemetry circuitry) compatible with the magnetic induction link 38a and
the protocol used by the IMD 10a, as explained subsequently.
 [0006]      In IMD 10b (Fig. 2B), short-range Radio Frequency (RF) communication
means-including short-range RF antenna 34b and compliant short-range RF telemetry
circuitry 28b-are provided that operate in accordance with a short-range RF communication
standard and its underlying protocols to bi-directionally communicate with an external device
along a short-range RF communication link 38b. Short-range RF communication link 38b
typically operates using far-field electromagnetic waves ranging from 10 MHz to 10 GHz or
so, and allows communications between devices at distances of about 50 feet or less. Short
range RF standards supported by short-range RF telemetry circuitry 28b and antenna 34b
                                                2

include, for example, Bluetooth, BLE, NFC, Zigbee, WiFi (802.1 lx), and the Medical
Implant Communication Service (MICS). Short-range RF antenna 34b can take any number
of well-known forms for an electromagnetic antenna, such as patches, slots, wires, etc., and
can operate as a dipole or a monopole. The external device in Figure 2B would also contain
short-range RF communication means compatible with short-range RF link 38b and the
standard/protocols used in IMD 10b, as explained subsequently.
 [0007]     Although both of antennas 34a and 34b in IMDs 10a and 10b are shown in
Figures 2A and 2B inside of case 12, they may also be placed within the IMD's header 22, or
on the outside of the case 12. Although shown as exclusive in Figures 2A and 2B, an IMD
 10 may have both of the different types of antennas 10a and 10b.
 [0008]     Different configurations for external devices used to communicate with IMDs
such as 10a and 10b exist in the prior art. Such external devices are typically used to send or
adjust the therapy settings the IMD 10a or 10b will provide to the patient (such as which
electrodes 16 are active to issue pulses; whether such electrodes sink or source current (i.e.,
polarity); the duration, frequency, and amplitude of pulses, etc.), which settings together
comprise a stimulation program for the patient. External devices can also act as receivers of
data from the IMD 10a or 10b, such as various data reporting on the IMD's status and the
level of the IMD's battery 14.
 [0009]     An external device having such functionality is shown in Figure 3 in the form of a
patient remote control 40.     Remote control (RC) 40 is typically hand-held, portable, and
powered by a battery (not shown) within the RC's housing 41, which battery may be a
primary battery or rechargeable. The RC 40 includes a Graphical User Interface (GUI) 43
similar to that used for a cell phone, including buttons 42 and a screen 44, and may have
other interface aspects as well, such as a speaker. The RC 40 also includes within its housing
41 communication means, including a coil antenna 49a and/or a short-range RF antenna 49b,
compatible with the link(s) 38a and/or 38b and the communication means in the IMDs 10a
and/or 10b. Processing in the RC 40 is controlled via a microcontroller 46. As described
above with respect to the IMDs 10a and 10b, antennas 49a and 49b would be associated with
telemetry circuitry, although this is not shown in Figure 3. One or more orthogonal coil
antennas 49a driven out of phase could be used in RC 40 as well to improve communication
coupling with the IMD 10a along magnetic induction link 38a, as discussed in U.S. Patent
Application Publication 2009/0069869, with which the reader is assumed familiar.
 [0010]     Shown on the screen 44 in Figure 3 are various options provided by the GUI 43
and selectable by a patient to control his IMD 10 (e.g. the stimulation program it is executing)
                                               3

or to monitor his IMD 10. Just a few typical options are depicted for simplicity that enable
the patient to: start or stop stimulation; increase or decrease the amplitude of the stimulation
pulses; check IMD monitoring information, such as the battery 14 level, operating status of
the IMD, or other data telemetered from the IMD; etc.
 [0011]      Also shown in Figure 3, and as disclosed in U.S. Patents 8,498,716 and 8,588,925,
an RC 40 can includes a port 45 on its housing 41, which may comprise a USB port for
example. The '716 patent teaches that USB port 45 can be used to: recharge the RC 40's
battery from a wall plug (assuming such battery is rechargeable); exchange data with another
external device (such as an external computer; not shown); or couple to an external charging
coil (not shown) to charge the IMD's battery 14 (assuming such battery 14 is rechargeable),
in effect allowing RC 40 to operate as a combination RC/charger.
 [0012]      The '925 patent teaches that USB port 45 can be used to convey contraindication
information-e.g., activities that might be counter-indicated for an IMD patient such as
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) or some physical activity-to a person of interest, such
as the patient or her clinician. In this regard, the '925 patent teaches that a cable can couple
between port 45 on the RC 40 and a port on an external computer to allow contraindication
information to be reviewed outside of the RC 40 itself. Alternatively, the '925 patent teaches
that a memory stick (not shown) may be coupled to port 45 to allow contraindication
information resident in the RC 40 to be written to the memory stick, which memory stick can
then be removed from the RC 40 and coupled to the external computer where the
contraindication information can be reviewed.
 [0013]      External devices such as the RC 40 of Figure 3 were historically built by the
manufacturer of the IMDs, and thus were generally dedicated to communicate only with such
IMDs. As such, dedicated RC 40 is not freely programmable by a patient, but is instead
limited to the IMD functionality provided by the manufacturer. (However, the microcode
operating in the RC's microcontroller 46 may be upgraded from time to time in manners
specified by the manufacturer).      However, there are many user-programmable commercial
mobile devices, such as cell phones, that can provide GUIs and have inherent communication
means suitable for functioning as a wireless external controller for an IMD.
 [0014]      Figures 4A and 4B show an example of a mobile device 50 configured for use as
an external controller for an IMD, as described in commonly-owned U.S. Patent Application
Publication 2015/0073498; and U.S. Patent Application 14/599,743, filed January 19, 2015.
The mobile device 50 may be a commercial, multipurpose, consumer device, such as a cell
phone, tablet, personal data assistant, laptop or notebook computer, or like device
                                                 4

essentially any mobile, hand-holdable device capable of functioning as a wireless external
controller for an IMD. Examples include the Apple iPhone or iPad, Microsoft Surface, Nokia
Lumia devices, Samsung Galaxy devices, and Google Android devices for example.
 [0015]     As shown in Figure 4A, the mobile device 50 includes a GUI 53 with a screen 54,
which may also receive input if it is a touch screen. The mobile device 50 may also have
buttons 52 (e.g., a keyboard) for receiving input from the patient, a speaker 56, and a
microphone 58. Mobile device 50 further includes a battery within its housing 51, although
not shown, which battery may be a primary battery or rechargeable. Mobile device 50 can
also include ports 55 and 57, which are subsequently explained. Mobile device 50 further
includes at least one short-range RF antenna 59, again as subsequently explained, and would
include telemetry circuitry compliant with that antenna(s), although not shown. Processing in
the mobile device 50 is controlled by a microcontroller 61.
 [0016]     Shown on the screen 54 is a typical home screen GUI 53 provided by the mobile
device 50 when first booted or reset. A number of applications ("apps") 60 may be present
and displayed as icons on the mobile device home screen GUI 53, which the patient can
select and execute.
 [0017]     One of the applications (icons) displayed in Figure 4A is a Medical Device
Application (MDA) 70, which may reside as microcode in the mobile device 50's
microcontroller 61. When MDA 70 is executed by the patient, the microcontroller 61 will
configure the mobile device 50 for use as an external controller to communicate with an
IMD. Figure 4B shows the GUI 73 provided by the MDA 70 after it is executed, which
includes options selectable by a patient to control his stimulation program or monitor his
IMD, similar to what was described earlier with respect to the GUI 43 of the dedicated RC 40
of Figure 3.
 [0018]     The MDA 70, like other applications 60 selectable in the mobile device 50, may
have been downloaded using traditional techniques, such as from an Internet server or an
"app store." Although not strictly necessary, MDA 70 is logically developed and provided by
the manufacturer of the IMD, and may be made available in different versions to work with
different mobile device operating systems (e.g., iOS, Android, Windows, etc.). One skilled
in the art will understand that MDA 70 comprises instructions that can be stored in the mobile
device 50 or on an Internet server for example on non-transistory machine-readable media,
such as magnetic, optical, or solid-state discs, integrated circuits, memory sticks, tapes, etc.
 [0019]     When the MDA 70 on the mobile device 50 is first selected and executed, or when
an appropriate selection is made in the MDA, wireless communications with the IMD can be
                                                5

established using a communication means in the mobile device 50 and enabled by the MDA
70. The above-incorporated '498 Publication discloses different examples in which such
communication can occur, illustrated here in Figures 5A-5C.
[0020]     In Figure 5A, the MDA 70 establishes wireless communication directly with the
IMD1Ob along short-range RF link 38b using short-range RF communication means
supported by the mobile device 50 (e.g., WiFi or Bluetooth), including one of its short-range
RF antennas 59 (Fig. 4A).       In this instance, the IMD 10b would include short-range
communication means compatible with short-range RF link 38b such as a short-range RF
antenna 34b shown earlier with respect to Figure 2B.
[0021]     In Figure 5B, a coil antenna 72 in a communication head 74 is coupled by a cable
76 to the port 55 on the mobile device 50, such as a USB port. In this example, the coil
antenna 72 can be placed proximate to the IMD 10a to establish a magnetic induction link
38a, perhaps as modulated via FSK as mentioned earlier.        The IMD 10a would include
communication means compatible with magnetic induction link 38a such as a coil antenna
34a shown earlier with respect to Figure 2A. The MDA 70 in this example would cause the
mobile device 50 to issue and receive data at its USB port 55, which data may be modulated
or digital depending whether the modulation/demodulation circuitry resides in the mobile
device 50 or the communication head 74.
[0022]     In Figure 5C, the mobile device 50 communicates with the IMD 10a via an
intermediary bridge 80. The bridge 80 contains first communication means including a short
range RF antenna 82b for wirelessly communicating with the mobile device 50 via short
range RF link 38b, and second communication means including a coil antenna 82a for
wirelessly communicating with the IMD 10a via a magnetic induction link 38a. The bridge
80, which is preferably battery powered (battery not shown), essentially "translates" data on
short-range RF link 38b into (FSK) data on magnetic induction link 38a, and vice versa. The
MDA 70 can thus program the mobile device 50 to use its inherent short-range RF
communication means (e.g., short-range antenna 59) to communicate with the IMD 10a, even
if the IMD 10a is not compatible with such means, because the bridge 80 can translate and
communicate with both. The communication system of Figure 5C is further explained in
U.S. Patent Application Publication 2013/0215285.
[0023]     The '498 Publication further teaches that the MDA 70 can secure the mobile
device 50 by controlling hardware and software that could affect, or worse corrupt, its use as
an IMD external controller.    Addressing such security issues is prudent because general
purpose commercial mobile devices by virtue of their broad connectivity are potentially
                                              6

subject to software viruses or tampering ("hacking").      For example, the '498 Publication
discloses that the MDA 70 upon execution can temporarily configure the mobile device 50 to
prevent operation inconsistent with external controller functionality, such as by disabling or
reconfiguring hardware modules in the mobile device 50 that are either unnecessary or could
potentially interfere with operation of the MDA 70. The MDA 70 can also terminate or
temporarily suspend software tasks that might interfere with secure operation of the mobile
device 50 as an external controller, such as other apps 60 displayable and executable from the
mobile device home screen GUI 53 (Fig. 4A), or other software tasks that may run in the
background of the mobile device in manners not immediately noticeable to the patient.
 [0024]     The above-incorporated '743 Application describes other techniques for using a
mobile device 50 to communicate with an IMD 10a or 10b, which are illustrated here in
Figures 6A-6C. In these techniques, an accessory 90 with a connector 92 is coupled to an
audio port 57 on the mobile device. The connector 92 and audio port 57 are co-axial, and
typically comprise a left and right audio output signal, an audio input signal (MIC), and a
ground. Typically a pair of headphones and/or a microphone (not shown) can be coupled to
the audio port 57 on the mobile device 50 as is well known.          Such signaling allows the
accessory 90 to communicate bi-directionally with the mobile device 50. Additionally, the
accessory 90 can receive power from the mobile device 50 for its circuitry via connector
92/audio port 57, or can include its own battery, as explained in the '743 Application.
Although not depicted here, the '743 Application teaches that the accessory 90 can be
coupled to a different type of port on the mobile device 50, such as the USB port 55.
 [0025]     In the '743 Application, the accessory 90 is used to facilitate quick execution of
the MDA 70 on the mobile device 50, essentially allowing a user instant access to GUI 73 to
communicate with his IMD 10. In one example, the accessory 90 is used to immediately
execute the MDA 70 on the mobile device, either upon pressing a switch 94 and/or when the
accessory 90 is inserted into the audio port 57 and automatically validated by the mobile
device 50.    The accessory 90 can facilitate immediate execution of the MDA 70 by by
passing security measures inherent in the mobile device 50, such as screen locks or
passwords, thus removing these encumbrances. The accessory 90 can further enable securing
of the mobile device 50 for use as an IMD external controller, as explained above with
respect to the '498 Publication. The use of the accessory 90 also provides a physical measure
of IMD security, as the MDA 70 can be programmed to not execute if the patient's accessory
90 is not present and validated. Electronics in the accessory 90 are described in the '743
Application but are largely omitted here.
                                               7

 [0026]      In the example of Figure 6A, once the MDA 70 is executed, communication with
the IMD occurs using short-range communication means provided in the mobile device 50
itself, including at least one of its short-range RF antennas 59. This assumes use with an
IMD (e.g.,      10b) having a short-range RF antenna (e.g.,        34b) compliant with the
communication standard used by antenna 59.
 [0027]      If the IMD is not so compliant, other examples in the '743 Application provide
antennas in the accessories 90, as shown in Figures 6B and 6C. In Figure 6B, the accessory
90 includes a coil antenna 96a capable of communicating with an IMD compliant with such
communication means, such as IMD 10a of Figure 2A. In Figure 6C, the accessory 90
includes a short-range RF antenna 96b compliant with the IMD, such as IMD 10b of Figure
2B. In this example, the accessory 90's short-range RF antenna 96b can communicate using
a standard supported by the IMD 10b (e.g., MICS) which may not be supported by the short
range RF antenna 59 in the mobile device 50 (e.g., WiFi or Bluetooth).         In either of the
examples of Figures 6B and 6C, communications with the IMD 10a or 10b as controlled by
the MDA 70 on the mobile device 50 occurs bi-directionally using the accessory 90's
antennas 96a or 96b and the data path provided by audio port 57/connector 92. As such, the
mobile device 50 in this example is only used for its easy provision of a GUI, rather than for
its inherent communication capabilities (such as its non-compliant short-range RF antenna
59).    Otherwise, the accessories 90 of Figures 6B and 6C provide the same benefits to
security and ease of use provided by the accessory 90 of Figure 6A.
                             SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
 [0028]      A system and related methods for communicating with an Implantable Medical
Device (IMD) are disclosed. A remote control in the system comprises a first user interface
and a first antenna. The first user interface is configured to enable a user to transmit a first
control instruction for the IMD from the first antenna to the IMD via a first wireless link.
The remote control also includes a second antenna configured to receive from an external
device a second control instruction for the IMD via a second wireless link. So configured,
the remote control can translate the second control instruction and transmit it from the first
antenna to the IMD via the first wireless link. The system optionally also includes a Medical
Device Application (MDA) executable and stored on the external device, wherein the MDA
is configured to provide a second user interface to enable the user to form the second control
instruction for the IMD on the second wireless link. The external device can comprise a
mobile device such as a cell phone, or a wearable mobile device such as an Optical Head
                                                8

Mounted Display (OHMD). The first wireless link may carry data in a first format, and the
second wireless link may carry data in a second format.       Also, the first wireless link may
comprises a magnetic induction link while the second wireless link comprises a short-range
RF link, or both links may comprise short-range RF links. The first and second antennas can
be within a housing of the remote control, or the antenna can be removably coupleable to the
remote control, such as to a port on the housing like a USB port. As well as transmitting
control instructions to the IMD, remote control is further configured to receive first
monitoring information from the IMD at the first antenna via the first wireless link, where
such first monitoring information is displayed to the user at the first user interface; and to
receive second monitoring information from the IMD at the first antenna via the first wireless
link, where the remote control can then translate the second monitoring information and
transmit it from the second antenna to the external device via the second wireless link.

 [0037]     Figure 9 shows use of the dedicated RC as described in Figure 7 as an

intermediary in a system in which an Optical Head-Mounted Display (OHMD) is used as the
mobile device to control and monitor the IMD, accordance with an example of the invention.
                                  DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0038]       While the prior art techniques described in the Background provide workable
manners for communicating with an IMD that are advantageous in leveraging the
programmable and communicative aspects inherent in commercial mobile devices, the
inventors see room for improvement.
[0039]       In particular, the inventors recognize that while mobile devices 50 can substitute
for dedicated external IMD controllers 40 provided by the manufacturer, perhaps as assisted
by supporting software and hardware discussed previously (such as MDA 70, Figs. 4A and
4B; communication head 74, Fig 5B; bridge 80, Fig. 5C; or plug-in accessories 90, Figs. 6A
6B), it may still be prudent for manufacturer to provide a dedicated RC 40 to the IMD
patient, such as shown in Figure 3.
[0040]       Providing a dedicated RC 40 to IMD patients is prudent at least to act as a "back
up" to allow IMD communications should the mobile device 50 experience problems. While
a manufacturer can provide and guarantee a MDA 70 and supporting hardware to enable a
mobile device 50 to function as an external controller, the manufacturer cannot guarantee the
reliability and operation of the mobile device itself, let alone all of the various mobile devices
its patients may wish to use to communicate with their IMDs.              General-purpose mobile
devices 50 also present security issues that should generally not be inherent in dedicated RCs
40, as discussed in the Background with reference to the '498 Publication.
[0041]       Additionally, a manufacturer cannot assume that a patient will have a mobile
device 50 operable to communicate with an IMD. A given patient may simply not own a
mobile device 50, or her device 50 may not be suitable for IMD communications-for
example, if it is too old, or if its operating system is otherwise not compliant with the IMD
manufacturer's requirements (such as the manufacturer's MDA 70). Or, a given patient's
mobile device 50 may not have the inherent capability of communicating with the patient's
IMD, at least directly. As discussed in the Background, a patient's mobile device 50 may
inherently have short-range RF communication means such as antenna 59 (operating per
Bluetooth or WiFi communication standards) that may not be compatible with the
communication means provided in an IMD-such as a magnetic induction coil antenna 34a
in the IMD 10a of Figure 2A, or a short-RF MICS antenna 34b in the IMD 10b of Figure 2B.
As discussed in the Background, supporting hardware may be necessary to allow
                                                10

communications between incompatible mobile devices 50 and IMDs 10 (e.g., communication
head 74, bridge 80, plug-in accessories 90, etc.), which again the manufacturer cannot assume
the patient will have at their disposal.
 [0042]     In short, sole reliance on mobile devices 50 as external IMD controllers may be
problematic. As a result, IMD manufacturers may still wish to additionally provide dedicated
external IMD controllers 40 to their IMD patients to ensure a reliable and safe means to allow
IMD therapy to be adjusted, monitored, or even turned off if necessary.
 [0043]     Thus, a patient may have two means available to communicate with his IMD 10
a dedicated RC 40 and a mobile device 50. The inventors have discerned that these devices
40 and 50 can function together in a manner easing use of the mobile device 50 to operate as
an external controller by allowing the patient's dedicated RC 40 to act as an intermediary
bridge to couple communication from the mobile device 50 to the patient's IMD 10. This is
similar in functionality to the bridge device 80 discussed in the Background with reference to
Figure 5C, and as disclosed in the above-referenced '285 Publication. However, unlike the
bridge 80, the dedicated RC 40 includes a full user graphical user interface (GUI) 43
(including screen 44 and buttons 42) which allows the patient to control therapy settings the
IMD and to monitor data transmitted from the IMD. Bridge 80, by contrast, merely contains
communication means to in effect translate communications to and from the IMD 10. Bridge
80 contains no user interface, let alone a graphical user interface, to allow IMD control or
monitoring.
 [0044]     Figure 7 shows an example of a system 100 in which a mobile device 50 uses a
dedicated RC 40 to communicate with an IMD 10. The mobile device 50 as before can be
programmed with an MDA 70 to allow IMD control and monitoring of IMD information via
GUI 73, and which may perform additional security related tasks befitting mobile device 50
use as an external controller, as discussed earlier. Also shown is one of the mobile device
50's inherent antennas 59 and (associated telemetry circuitry not shown), which is internal to
the mobile device's housing 51. Antenna 59 as explained earlier is preferably a short-range
RF antenna operable with communication means typically inherent in mobile device 50, such
as those operable according to Bluetooth and WiFi standards.
 [0045]     The dedicated RC 40 in system 100 has been modified to include a short-range RF
antenna 104 which is compliant with the short-range RF communication means (e.g., antenna
59) in the mobile device 50, thus enabling bi-directional communications between the mobile
device 50 and the dedicated RC 40 via a short-range RF link 38c. The GUI 43 provided by
the dedicated RC 40 may be identical to the GUI 73 rendered by the MDA 70 at the mobile
                                               11

device 50, or at least may include identical functionality in terms of selectable options
useable to control and monitor the IMD 10. Alternatively, the GUIs 73 and 43 of the devices
50 and 40 may comprise a subset of the functionality provided by the other device 40 or 50.
 [0046]      Different versions of short-range RF antennas can be used in the dedicated RC 40.
An external short-range antenna 104 is shown in Figure 7 as contained within a dongle 102
coupleable to a port on the dedicated RC 40's housing 41.            In the example shown, a
connector 103 on the dongle 102 is coupleable to the dedicated RC 40's USB port 45. Such
RF-compliant dongles 102 are well known and need not be specially manufactured for use
with the dedicated RC. For example, suitable dongles 102 coupleable to USB ports can
include those used by a wireless computer mouse (input device) to communicate with a
computer. As one skilled in the art will understand, dongle 102 may contain other control
circuitry (not shown) as necessary to supplement operation of the short-range RF antenna
 104.
 [0047]      Use of an external short-range antenna 104 is beneficial as it allows the type of
short-range RF antenna to be readily changed to match the standard being used by the short
range RF antenna 59 in the mobile device 50. For example, one dongle 102 may include a
Bluetooth antenna 104, while another may include a WiFi antenna 104, etc.           Short-range
antenna 104' by contrast is contained within dedicated RC 40's housing 41. As the antenna
 104' is internal and not accessible, care should be taken to ensure that the antenna 104' will
be compliant with communication standard used in a majority of mobile devices 50 (e.g.,
Bluetooth).
 [0048]      Communications between the dedicated RC 40 and the IMD 10 occurs using the
antenna 49a/b used for communications with the IMD 10 even when the mobile device 50 is
not present. As explained in the Background, the type of antenna 49 used can be dictated by
the type of antenna 34 used in the IMD 10. If the IMD 10a includes a coil antenna 34a (Fig.
2A), the dedicated RC 40 would likewise include a coil antenna 49a for bi-directional
communication along a magnetic induction link 38a. If the IMD 10b includes a short-range
RF antenna 34b (Fig. 2B), the dedicated RC 40 would likewise include a short-range RF
antenna 49b for bi-directional communication along a short-range RF link 38b. In this case,
care should be taken to ensure that the antennas 49b and 34b are compliant with the same
short-range RF communication standard (e.g., MICS).          Preferably, and as is typical, the
antenna 49a/b is internal to the housing 41 of the dedicated RC 40.
 [0049]      Regardless of the particular antennas and links used, the dedicated RC 40 acts as
an intermediary device to permit bi-directional communication between the mobile device 50
                                               12

and the IMD 10, regardless of the communication means supported by those two devices. In
this regard, the microcontroller 46 in the dedicated RC 40 can operate to translate between
different communication formats (i.e., different standards, different modulation schemes,
different protocols, etc.) used by the mobile device 50 and the IMD 10.
 [0050]     Assume for example that the MDA 70 operating on the mobile device 50 enables
the mobile device's Bluetooth short-range RF antenna 59 to transmit and receive
communications to and from the IMD 10, and that the IMD has a coil antenna 34a (Fig. 2A).
In this circumstance, the dedicated RC 40 will have a Bluetooth short-range RF antenna
 104/104' compliant with the communication means in the mobile device 50, and a coil
antenna 49a compliant with the communication means in the IMD 10a, as shown in the
schematic at the bottom of Figure 7. Also shown in the schematic are telemetry circuitries
 106 and 107 coupled to and between each of the antennas 104/104' and 49a and the RC's
microcontroller     46.     The   telemetry   circuitries 106   and   107   generally  include
modulation/antenna driver circuitry for transmitting data and amplifier/filter/demodulation
circuitry for receiving data in accordance with the format of the data on the links they
support.    Each of the telemetry circuitries 106 and 107 communicated digital data bi
directionally with the microcontroller.
 [0051]     The microcontroller 46 in the dedicated RC 40 can be programmed to translate
data received in one format and to transmit that data in a second format. For example, when
antenna 104/104' receives Bluetooth formatted data from short-range antenna 59 in the
mobile device 59 via short-range RF link 38c (such as a control instruction for the IMD to
increase or decrease stimulation, etc.), the microcontroller 46 can cause FSK telemetry
circuitry 107 to transmit that data in an FSK format from its coil antenna 49a via magnetic
induction link 38a to the coil antenna 34a in the IMD 10a, allowing the IMD 10a to then
execute the control instruction.      Likewise, the dedicated RC 40 can receive monitoring
information transmitted from the coil antenna 34a in the IMD 10a via magnetic induction link
38a at its coil antenna 49a, and its microcontroller 46 can cause Bluetooth telemetry circuitry
 106 to transmit that data in a Bluetooth format from its short-range RF antenna 104/104' via
short-range RF link 38c to the short-range antenna 59 in the mobile device 50, where such
received data can be viewed using the MDA GUI 73.
 [0052]     When so operating as an intermediary, the dedicated RC 40 may enter an
intermediary mode of operation in which the dedicated RC 40 only operates to translate
between the mobile device 50 and IMD 10. Such an intermediary mode can be separate and
distinct from a normal operating mode in which the dedicated RC 40's GUI 43 is active to
                                               13

receive user inputs to control and monitor the IMD.        In other words, the GUI 43 of the
dedicated RC 40 may be disabled during the intermediary mode to prevent use of the
dedicated RC 40 to control and monitor the IMD 10. Alternatively, the dedicated RC 40 can
enable intermediary translating functionality between the mobile device 50 and the IMD 10
even during a normal operating mode in which IMD control and monitoring functions are still
accessible from the dedicated RC 40's GUI 43.
 [0053]     Entering the intermediary operation mode, or otherwise enabling intermediary
translating functionality, can be enabled in the dedicated RC 40 in any number of ways. For
example, if the dedicated RC 40's short-range RF antenna 104 is external (e.g., in dongle
 102), the dedicated RC 40 can enable translating of data when it senses that the dongle 102
has been inserted into an appropriate port (e.g., 45) on the dedicated RC 40. Alternatively,
translating of data can comprise an option 105 selectable by a user on the GUI 43 of the
dedicated RC 40, as shown in Figure 7. In another alternative, the dedicated RC 40 will
always translate data received at one antenna 49a/b or 104/104' and translate and retransmit
that data at the other antenna 104/104' or 49a/b, even if there is no device (mobile device 50
or IMD 10) in proximity to receive the translated data, in which case needless transmission of
the translated data will be harmless.
 [0054]     Note in the system of Figure 7 that the dedicated RC 40, as well as providing its
own GUI 43 permitting control and monitoring of the IMD 10, supplants supporting
hardware otherwise used in the prior art to alleviate incompatibilities between the
communication means used in the mobile device 50 and the IMD 10.                  For example,
communication head 74 (Fig 5B) and plug-in accessories 90 (Figs. 6A-6B) are not required to
be used with the mobile device 50.
 [0055]     When the system of Figure 7 is used, and in particular when the IMD 10a has a
coil antenna 34a (Fig. 2A), it is preferable to place the dedicated RC 40 in proximity to the
IMD 10a because the magnetic induction link 38a supported by coil antenna 34a in the IMD
 10a between them is relatively short (e.g., 12 inches or less as noted earlier).      Assuring
dedicated RC-to-IMD 10a proximity can occur in any number of ways, depending on where
the IMD 10 is implanted in the body. For example, if the IMD is a Spinal Cord Stimulation
(SCS) IPG 10, it would be implanted in the upper buttocks.      If it is a Deep Brain Stimulator
(DBS) IPG 10, it would be implanted under the collar bone in the patient's chest. Various
belts or holsters into which the dedicated RC 40 can be inserted can be used hold the
dedicated RC 40 in place and proximate to the IMD. Alternatively, a cord can be attached to
the dedicated RC 40 to suspend it from the neck or waist in good proximity to the IMD 10a.
                                               14

The dedicated RC 40 could also include fastening means attached to its housing 41 to allow it
to be attached to the patient's clothing, such as a clip for example.   Dedicated RC-to-IMD
proximity is less important if the IMD 10b has a short-range RF antenna 34b (Fig. 2B)
operable at longer distances.
 [0056]     It should be noted that devices and systems other than a mobile device 50 can
benefit from use of the dedicated RC 40 as an intermediary to communicate with an IMD.
For example, Figure 8 shows use of the dedicated RC 40 as an intermediary device in the
context of a clinician programmer (CP) system 140 such as is described in U.S. Patent
Application Serial No. 14/710,283, filed May 12, 2015. CP system 140 is typically used by a
clinician to set up operation of a patient's IMD after implantation and to determine optimal
stimulation programs for a patient. In contrast to a mobile device 50, a CP system 140 is
generally stationary and located at an office of the clinician.
 [0057]     As shown, CP system 140 comprises a computing device 150, such as a desktop,
laptop, or notebook computer, a tablet, a mobile smart phone, a Personal Data Assistant
(PDA)-type mobile computing device, etc. (hereinafter "CP computer"). In Figure 8, CP
computer 150 is shown as a laptop computer that includes a typical computer GUI 153 such
as a screen 154, a mouse, a keyboard, speakers, a stylus, a printer, etc., not all of which are
shown for convenience.
 [0058]     As explained further in the '283 Application, CP software 170 operable in the CP
computer 150 is used to render a GUI 173 on the screen 154 of the CP computer 150 to allow
for control and monitoring of the IMD 10, in addition to many other more-complicated
functions of significance to the clinician but not normally accessible by the patient via a
mobile device 50 (MDA 70) or a dedicated RC 40. In this respect, CP computer 150 and CP
software 170 are analogous to the mobile device 50 and MDA 70 described earlier.
 [0059]      In the example shown in Figure 8, the antenna used in the CP system 140 to
communicate with the IPG 10 includes a wand 174 which is somewhat analogous to the
communication head 74 described earlier for use with mobile device 50 (Fig. 5B) in that it
includes a coil antenna 72 for bi-directionally communicating with an IMD 10a having a coil
antenna 34a (Fig. 2A), and is coupleable to a (USB) port 155 on the CP computer 150. Wand
 174 may also include a short-range RF antenna 172b compliant with an IMD 10b having a
short-range RF antenna 34b (Fig. 2B). (Wand 174 in an actual CP system would likely
contain only one of antennas 172a or 172b depending on the nature of the IMD 10
supported).
 [0060]     Use of the dedicated RC 40 as an intermediary device disposes of the need for a
                                               15

wand 174 in the CP system 140, even if the CP computer 150 and the IMD 10 cannot
otherwise directly communicate.        Instead, a patient can bring his dedicated RC 40 to his
clinician's office when the CP system 140 will be used. During IPG communications, the CP
system 140 can instead use communication means inherent in the CP computer 150, such as
one or more of its internal short-range RF antennas 159, which may be located in various
places in the CP computer 150. The dedicated RC 40 can receive data via short-range RF
link 38c from the antenna 159 at antenna 104/104', translate such data into a proper format,
and transmit it to the IMD 10 via one of its antennas 49a/b (depending on the nature of the
IMD lOa/b). Transmission of data in the other direction from the IMD 10 to the CP computer
 150 would likewise flow through the dedicated RC 40 as an intermediary. In short, use of the
dedicated RC 40 obviates the need for a separate wand 174 coupleable to the CP computer
 150 in the CP system 140.
 [0061]     Figure 9 shows another example of a system 200 in which a dedicated RC 40 is
used as an intermediary to pass communications between a mobile device and an IMD 10.
However, in this example, the mobile device comprises a wearable mobile device 210, more
specifically an Optical Head-Mounted Display 210, which is also disclosed in the above
referenced '283 Application. OHMD 210 can in one example comprise the Google GlassTM
OHMD, developed by Google, Inc. of Mountain View, California.
 [0062]     As described in the '283 Application, OHMD 210 is configured to be wearable
much like a pair of standard eyeglasses, and includes a frame 212 which also serves as the
temples supported by the wearer's ears, and nose pads 214.           Lenses (e.g., corrective or
sunglasses lenses) may be affixed to the frame 212, but are not shown in Figure 9. OHMD
210 may also be worn in conjunction with a wearer's normal eyeglasses.
 [0063]      Plastic affixed to the frame 212 generally defines a rearward housing 216 and a
forward housing 218 on the OHMD 210's right temple. Plastic also defines a pass-through
portion 220, which as well as defining a space for the wearer's right ear, also provides for the
passing of wires between the two housings 216 and 218. The rearward housing 216 holds a
rechargeable battery (not shown). A bone-conduction audio transducer 224 in the rearward
housing 216 protrudes through the plastic and presses over the right ear to permit the wearer
to hear sounds provided by the OHMD's GUI, which is explained below. OHMD 210 could
also include a more-traditional audio speaker as well.
 [0064]      The forward housing 218 includes a printed circuit board (not shown), which
supports the OHMD 210's main electronics, such as its microprocessor, and movement
sensors providing input to a motion detector module in the electronics, including a three-axis
                                                16

accelerometer and a three-axis gyroscope. Also included in the forward housing 218 is a
touch sensor (not shown), which allows the outer surface of the forward housing to operate as
a touch pad 226.     The touch pad 226 is sensitive to the wearer's touch across the two
dimensional expanse (X and Y) of the outer surface of the foreword housing 218, and can
additionally be pressed ("tapped") similar to a button. The underside of the forward housing
218 additionally includes a microphone 228 for the receipt of voice input in addition to inputs
receivable by the touch pad 226. The electronics of the OHMD 210 will include a voice
detection module for interpretation of spoken voice inputs, as is well known.
 [0065]     The forward housing 218 also includes a display portion 230 of the OHMD 210,
including an LED array 232 powered by the OHMD's microprocessor. Images 234 created at
the LED array 232 are directed to a prism 236 containing a polarizing beam-splitter that
direct the images 234 to the wearer's right eye.   In this manner, the user is able to perceive
the images 234 generated by the OHMD 210 and output by the display portion 230, which
images 234 are provided slightly to the right of the wearer's center of vision, thus allowing
the wearer to see the real world and the images on the display portion 230 simultaneously.
 [0066]     OHMD 210 in this example further includes bi-directional short-range RF
communication means, which like the mobile device 50 described earlier preferably includes
one or more antennas 236 and telemetry circuitry (not shown) compliant with Bluetooth and
Wi-Fi communication standards. The antenna 236 is shown located in the forward housing
218, but could be present elsewhere, such as in the rearward housing 218.
 [0067]     As explained in the '283 Application, the OHMD 210 can generate a Graphical
User Interface (GUI) 240 using the display portion 230 that can be used to control and
monitor the IMD 10. The input interface of the GUI 240 comprises one or more of the touch
pad 226, the voice detection module (coupled to microphone 228), and the motion detector
module coupled to the accelerometers and gyroscopes. This input interface allows a patient
to navigate the GUI 240 to control and monitor his IMD 10 either by touch, voice, or head
movements. Audio aspects (e.g., transducer 224 or another speaker) can also comprise part
of the OHMD GUI 240.
 [0068]     The '283 Application explains the OHMD GUI 240 in detail, and only a simple
example is shown in Figure 9. As seen by the patient via the display portion 230, a card 242
of information regarding a patient's current stimulation program (Program 1) is shown,
including stimulation (pulse) amplitude, duration and, frequency. A cursor 244 highlights
selection of a current parameter (amplitude in this example), which cursor can be moved
using the input interface (i.e., by touch, voice, or movement). In the example shown, the
                                              17

patient increases the currently-selected stimulation amplitude by swiping forward on the
touch pad 226, which then updates the information on the displayed card 242 (in this case
reflecting an amplitude increase from 2.2 mA to 2.4 mA).
 [0069]     When adjustments in IMD control are made in this fashion, a control instruction is
transmitted from the short-range RF antenna 236 in the OHMD 210 to the compliant short
range RF antenna 104/104' in the dedicated RC 40, where it is translated as explained earlier,
and broadcast to the IMD 10 via its internal antenna 49a/b (depending on the nature of the
IMD 10a/b). Although not depicted, the patient can also interact with the OHMD GUI 240 to
retrieve monitoring information from the IMD 10. When this request is received at the IMD
 10, the IMD 10 will in turn transmit the requested information from antenna 34a/b to antenna
49a/b in the dedicated RC 40, where it is translated and transmitted from short-range RF
antenna 104/ 104' to short-range antenna 236 the OHMD 210, and rendered for user review
via the OHMD GUI 240. As discussed earlier, use of the dedicated RC 40 as an intermediary
between the OHMD 210 and the IMD 10 is particularly useful if the OHMD 210 and IMD
cannot directly communicate given incompatibilities in their communication means.
 [0070]     It should be noted that antennas (e.g., 59, 159, or 236) in the various external IMD
controllers (mobile device 50, CP computer 150, or OHMD 210) and antenna 104/104'
associated with the dedicated RC 40 need not be short-range RF antennas, but could comprise
other antennas for communicating by other means. For example, such antennas can operate
in accordance with optical or acoustic principles as well, with the dedicated RC 40 still
operating to translate communications with the IMD 10. Such RF antennas also need not
comprise "short range" antennas, but could comprising longer-range RF antennas.
