Related Applications

No. 61/100,534, filed September 26, 2008, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its
entirety.

Application No. <removed-apn> is by this cross-reference incorporated into the present
specification.
Background of the Invention
[0003]          For T cells to respond to foreign polypeptides, at least two signals must be provided
by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) to resting T lymphocytes (Jenkins, M. and Schwartz, R.
(1987) J. Exp. Med. 165:302-319; Mueller, D. L. et al. (1990) J. Immunol. 144:3701-3709).
The first signal, which confers specificity to the immune response, is transduced via the T
cell receptor (TCR) following recognition of foreign antigenic peptide presented in the
context of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). The second signal, termed
costimulation, induces T cells to proliferate and become functional (Lenschow et al. (1996)
Annu. Rev. Immunol. 14:233). Costimulation is neither antigen-specific, nor MHC
restricted, and is provided by distinct cell surface molecules expressed by APCs (Jenkins, M.
K. et al. (1988) J. Immunol. 140:3324-3330; Linsley, P. S. et al. (1991) J. Exp. Med 173:721
730; Gimmi, C. D. et al. (1991) Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. USA 88:6575-6579; Young, J. W. et al.

(1990) J. Immunol. 144:4579-4586; LaSalle, J. M. et al. (1991) J. Immunol. 147:774-80;
Dustin, M. I. et al. (1989) J. Exp. Med. 169:503; Armitage, R. J. et al. (1992) Nature 357:80
82; Liu, Y. et al. (1992) J. Exp. Med 175:437-445).
[0004]          The proteins B7-1 (CD80) and B7-2 (CD86) are critical costimulatory molecules
(Freeman et al. (1991) J. Exp. Med. 174:625; Freeman et al. (1989) J. Immunol. 143:2714;
Azuma et al. (1993) Nature 366:76; Freeman et al. (1993) Science 262:909). B7-2 plays a
predominant role during primary immune responses, while B7-1, which is upregulated later
during an immune response, may be important for prolonging primary T cell responses or
costimulating secondary T cell responses (Bluestone (1995) Immunity 2:555).
                                                      1
10191856_1 (GHMatters) P86720.AU.4

[0005]          CD28 is a ligand for both B7-1 and B7-2 that is constitutively expressed by resting
T cells and increases in expression following T cell activation. Ligation of CD28 in
conjunction with a TCR signal results in transduction of a costimulatory signal that induces T
cells to proliferate and secrete IL-2 (Linsley, P. S. et al. (1991) J. Exp. Med. 173:721-730;
Gimmi, C. D. et al. (1991) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88:6575-6579; June, C. H. et al.
(1990) Immunol. Today 11:211-6; Harding, F. A. et al. (1992) Nature 356:607-609). A
second B7-1 and B7-2 ligand, CTLA4 (CD152), is homologous to CD28 but not expressed
by resting T cells. CTLA4 expression occurs following T cell activation (Brunet, J. F. et al.
(1987) Nature 328:267-270). Ligation of CTLA4 results in transduction of an inhibitory
signal that prevents T cell proliferation and cytokine secretion. Thus, CTLA4 is a critical
negative regulator of T cell responses (Waterhouse et al. (1995) Science 270:985) (Allison
and Krummel (1995) Science 270:932). The third member of the CD28 family to be
discovered is ICOS (Hutloff et al. (1999) Nature 397:263; WO 98/38216). Ligation of ICOS
by its ligand (ICOS-L) results in high levels of cytokine expression, but limited T cell
expansion (Riley J. L. et al. (2001) J. Immunol. 166:4943-48; Aicher A. et al. (2000) J.
Immunol. 164:4689-96; Mages H. W. et al. (2000) Eur. J Immunol. 30:1040-7; Brodie D. et
al. (2000) Curr. Biol. 10:333-6; Ling V. et al. (2000) J. Immunol. 164:1653-7; Yoshinaga S.
K. et al. (1999) Nature 402:827-32). If T cells are stimulated through the T cell receptor in
the absence of a costimulatory signal, they become nonresponsive, anergic, or die.
[0006]          The importance of the B7:CD28/CTLA4/ICOS costimulatory pathway has been
demonstrated in vitro and in several in vivo model systems. Blockade of this costimulatory
pathway results in the development of antigen specific tolerance in murine and human
systems (Harding, F. A. et al. (1992) Nature 356:607 609; Lenschow, D. J. et al. (1992)
Science 257:789 792; Turka, L. A. et al. (1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89:11102 11105;
Gimmi, C. D. et al. (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90:6586 6590; Boussiotis, V. et al.
(1993) J. Exp. Med. 178:1753 1763). Conversely, expression of B7 by B7-negative murine
tumor cells induces T-cell mediated specific immunity accompanied by tumor rejection and
long lasting protection to tumor challenge (Chen, L. et al. (1992) Cell 71:1093 1102;
Townsend, S. E. and Allison, J. P. (1993) Science 259:368 370; Baskar, S. et al. (1993) Proc.
Natl. Acad. Sci. 90:5687 5690.). Therefore, manipulation of the costimulatory pathways
offers great potential to stimulate or suppress immune responses in humans.
[0007]          The discovery of more members of the B7-1 and CD28 families has revealed
additional pathways that provide costimulatory and inhibitory second signals to T cells. One
                                                    2
10191856_1 (GHMatters) P86720.AU.4

of the newer pathways is represented by the programmed death 1 (PD-1; also known as
CD279) receptor and its ligands, PD-Li (B7-Hi; CD274) and PD-L2 (B7-DC; CD273). PD
 I is a member of the CD28/CTLA4 family that is expressed on activated, but not resting T
cells (Nishimura et al. (1996) Int. Immunol. 8:773). Ligation of PD-I by its ligands mediates
an inhibitory signal that results in reduced cytokine production, and reduced T cell survival
(Nishimura et al. (1999) Immunity 11:141; Nishimura et al. (2001) Science 291:319;
Chemnitz et al. (2004) J. Immunol. 173:945).
[0008]          PD-Li is a B7 family member that is expressed on many cell types, including APCs
and activated T cells (Yamazaki et al. (2002) J. Immunol. 169:5538). PD-Li binds to both
PD-I and B7- 1. Both binding of T-cell-expressed B7-1 by PD-LI and binding of T-cell
expressed PD-Li by B7-1 result in T cell inhibition (Butte et al. (2007) Immunity 27:111).
There is also evidence that, like other B7 family members, PD-Li can also provide
costimulatory signals to T cells (Subudhi et al. (2004) J. Clin. Invest. 113:694; Tamura et al.
(2001) Blood 97:1809).
[0009]          PD-L2 is a B7 family member expressed on various APCs, including dendritic cells,
macrophages and bone-marrow derived mast cells (Zhong et al. (2007) Eur. J. Immunol.
37:2405). APC-expressed PD-L2 is able to both inhibit T cell activation through ligation of
PD-I and costimulate T cell activation, through a PD-I independent mechanism (Shin et al.
(2005) J. Exp. Med. 201:1531). In addition, ligation of dendritic cell-expressed PD-L2
results in enhanced dendritic cell cytokine expression and survival (Radhakrishnan et al.
(2003) J. Immunol. 37:1827; Nguyen et al. (2002) J. Exp. Med. 196:1393). The structure and
expression of PD-1, PD-Li, and PD-L2, as well as signaling characteristics and functions of
these molecules in the context of regulating T cell activation and tolerance (e.g., therapeutic
effects) are reviewed in greater detail in Kier et al. (2008) Ann. Rev. Immunol. 26:677,
which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. Manipulation of this and other
costimulatory pathways offers great potential to stimulate or suppress immune responses in
humans and a need exists for compositions and methods useful for effecting such
manipulations.

Summary of the Invention
[0011]          The present invention is based on the generation and isolation of novel composite,
human monoclonal antibodies which specifically bind to human PD-1, human PD-Li, and
human PD-L2, as well as the characterization of such novel antibodies and the demonstration
of their therapeutic value in treating a variety of conditions mediated by PD-1, PD-Li, and/or
PD-L2. Common techniques used to humanize murine antibodies frequently produce
humanized antibodies that have reduced antigen binding affinities compared to the original
murine antibodies (Almagro and Fransson (2008) Frontiers in Bioscience 13:1619-1633;
Foote and Winter (1992) J. Mol. Biol. 224:487-499; Hwang et al. (2005) Methods 36: 35
42). Surprisingly, the composite, human antibodies of the present invention have been shown
to bind to PD-1, PD-LI or PD-L2 with affinities closely approximating those of the murine
antibodies. Furthermore, conventional humanization techniques produce humanized
antibodies that retain some murine sequence. As a result, such antibodies can retain
immunogenicity when administered to humans. For example, the humanized antibody
CAMPATH@ elicits immunogenicity in about 50% of patients. The composite, human
antibodies of the present invention, on the other hand, are completely derived from sequences
of human origin. Therefore, they are likely to be significantly less immunogenic and more
therapeutically effective and useful when administered to human patients than other anti
human PD-1, PD-Li, and/or PD-L2 antibodies. Accordingly, the composite, human
antibodies of the present invention provide an improved means for treating and preventing
disorders mediated by PD-1, PD-Li, and/or PD-L2, attributable in part to their unique
specificity, affinity, structure, functional activity and the fact that they are derived from
human antibody sequences. The present invention is also based on the discovery of new
therapeutic applications, including treatment of persistent infectious diseases, asthma,
inflammatory diseases, and cancers, by administering the composite, human antibodies
described herein.

Detailed Description of the Invention
[0046]          The present invention provides novel antibody-based therapeutics for treating and
diagnosing a variety of disorders mediated by PD-1, PD-Li, and/or PD-L2 (e.g., treatment of
persistent infectious diseases, asthma, inflammatory diseases, transplant rejections and
cancers).
 [0047]         In order that the present invention may be more readily understood, certain terms
are first defined. Additional definitions are set forth throughout the detailed description.
 [0048]         In the claims which follow and in the description of the invention, except where the
context requires otherwise due to express language or necessary implication, the word
''comprise" or variations such as "comprises" or "comprising" is used in an inclusive sense,
i.e. to specify the presence of the stated features but not to preclude the presence or addition
of further features in various embodiments of the invention.
 [0049]         As used herein, the terms "PD-I", "PD-Li", and "PD-L2" include any variants or
isoforms which are naturally expressed by cells, and/or fragments thereof having at least one
biological activity of the full-length polypeptide, unless otherwise expressly defined. In
addition, the term "PD-I ligand" includes either or both PD-LI (Freeman et al. (2000) J Exp.
Med. 192:1027) and PD-L2 (Latchman et al. (2001) Nat. Immunol. 2:261) and any variants or
isoforms which are naturally expressed by cells, and/or fragments thereof having at least one
biological activity of the full-length polypeptides. For example, PD-1, PD-Li, and PD-L2
sequences from different species, including humans, are well known in the art (see, for
example, herein incorporated in their entirety by reference, Honjo et al., U.S. Pat. No.
                                                     11
10191856_1 (GHMatters) P86720.AU.4

5,629,204, which discloses human and mouse PD-I sequences; Wood et al., U.S. Patent
7,105,328, which discloses human PD-I sequences; Chen et al., U.S. Patent 6,803,192, which
discloses human and mouse PD-Li sequences; Wood et al., U.S. Patent 7,105,328, which
discloses human PD-Li sequences; Freeman et al., US Pat. Pub. 20020164600, which
discloses human and mouse PD-L2 sequences).
[0050]          As used herein, the term "antibody" includes whole antibodies and any antigen
binding fragment (i.e., "antigen-binding portion") or single chain thereof. An "antibody"
refers to a glycoprotein comprising at least two heavy (H) chains and two light (L) chains
inter-connected by disulfide bonds, or an antigen binding portion thereof. Each heavy chain
is comprised of a heavy chain variable region (abbreviated herein as VH) and a heavy chain
constant region. The heavy chain constant region is comprised of three domains, CHI, CH2
and CH3. Each light chain is comprised of a light chain variable region (abbreviated herein
as VL) and a light chain constant region. The light chain constant region is comprised of one
domain, CL. The VH and VL regions can be further subdivided into regions of
hypervariability, termed complementarity determining regions (CDR), interspersed with
regions that are more conserved, termed framework regions (FR). Each VH and VL is
composed of three CDRs and four FRs, arranged from amino-terminus to carboxy-terminus
in the following order: FRI, CDRi, FR2, CDR2, FR3, CDR3, FR4. The variable regions of
the heavy and light chains contain a binding domain that interacts with an antigen.
"Inactivating antibodies" refers to antibodies that do not induce the complement system.
[0051]          The term "hypervariableregion," "HVR," or "HV," when used herein refers to the
regions of an antibody-variable domain that are hypervariable in sequence and/or form
structurally defined loops. Generally, antibodies comprise six HVRs; three in the VH (HI,
H2, H3), and three in the VL (LI, L2, L3). In native antibodies, H3 and L3 display the most
diversity of the six HVRs, and H3 in particular is believed to play a unique role in conferring
fine specificity to antibodies. See, e.g., Xu et al. Immunity 13:37-45 (2000); Johnson and Wu
in Methods in Molecular Biology 248:1-25 (Lo, ed., Human Press, Totowa, NJ, 2003)).
Indeed, naturally occurring camelid antibodies consisting of a heavy chain only are functional
and stable in the absence of light chain. See, e.g., Hamers-Casterman et al., Nature 363:446
448 (1993) and Sheriff et al., Nature Struct. Biol. 3:733-736 (1996).
[0052]          A number of hypervariable region delineations are in use and are encompassed
herein. The Kabat Complementarity Determining Regions (CDRs) are based on sequence
variability and are the most commonly used (Kabat et al., Sequences ofProteins of
                                                    12
10191856_1 (GHMatters) P86720.AU.4

Immunological Interest, 5th Ed. Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health,
Bethesda, MD. (1991)). Chothia refers instead to the location of the structural loops (Chothia
and Lesk J Mol. Biol. 196:901-917 (1987)). The end of the Chothia CDR-H1 loop when
numbered using the Kabat numbering convention varies between H32 and H34 (see below)
depending on the length of the loop (this is because the Kabat numbering scheme places the
insertions at H35A and H35B; if neither 35A nor 35B is present, the loop ends at 32; if only
35A is present, the loop ends at 33; if both 35A and 35B are present, the loop ends at 34).
The AbM hypervariable regions represent a compromise between the Kabat CDRs and
Chothia structural loops, and are used by Oxford Molecular's AbM antibody modeling
software. The "contact" hypervariable regions are based on an analysis of the available
complex crystal structures. The residues from each of these hypervariable regions are noted
below.

[0053]          Hypervariable regions may comprise "extended hypervariable regions" as follows:
24-36 or 24-34 (LI), 46-56 or 50-56 (L2) and 89-97 (L3) in the VL and 26-35B (HI), 50-65,
47-65 or 49-65 (H2) and 93-102, 94-102 or 95-102 (H3) in the VH. These extended
hypervariable regions are typically combinations of the Kabat and Chothia definitions, which
may optionally further include residues identified using the Contact definition. The variable
domain residues are numbered according to Kabat et al., supra for each of these definitions.
[0054]          "Framework" or "FR" residues are those variable-domain residues other than the
HVR residues as herein defined.
[0055]          The expression "variable-domain residue-numbering as in Kabat" or "amino-acid
position numbering as in Kabat," and variations thereof, refers to the numbering system used
                                                     13
10191856_1 (GHMatters) P86720.AU.4

for heavy-chain variable domains or light-chain variable domains of the compilation of
antibodies in Kabat et al., supra. Using this numbering system, the actual linear amino acid
sequence may contain fewer or additional amino acids corresponding to a shortening of, or
insertion into, a FR or HVR of the variable domain. For example, a heavy-chain variable
domain may include a single amino acid insert (residue 52a according to Kabat) after residue
52 of H2 and inserted residues (e.g. residues 82a, 82b, and 82c, etc. according to Kabat) after
heavy-chain FR residue 82. The Kabat numbering of residues may be determined for a given
antibody by alignment at regions of homology of the sequence of the antibody with a
"standard" Kabat numbered sequence.
[0056]          The term "Fc region" herein is used to define a C-terminal region of an
immunoglobulin heavy chain, including native-sequence Fc regions and variant Fc regions.
Although the boundaries of the Fc region of an immunoglobulin heavy chain might vary, the
human IgG heavy-chain Fc region is usually defined to stretch from an amino acid residue at
position Cys226, or from Pro230, to the carboxyl-terminus thereof. The C-terminal lysine
(residue 447 according to the EU numbering system) of the Fc region may be removed, for
example, during production or purification of the antibody, or by recombinantly engineering
the nucleic acid encoding a heavy chain of the antibody. Accordingly, a composition of
intact antibodies may comprise antibody populations with all K447 residues removed,
antibody populations with no K447 residues removed, and antibody populations having a
mixture of antibodies with and without the K447 residue. Suitable native-sequence Fc
regions for use in the antibodies of the invention include human IgG 1, IgG2 (IgG2A,
IgG2B), IgG3 and IgG4.
[0057]          "Fc receptor" or "FcR" describes a receptor that binds to the Fc region of an
antibody. The preferred FcR is a native sequence human FcR. Moreover, a preferred FcR is
one which binds an IgG antibody (a gamma receptor) and includes receptors of the FcyRI,
FcyRII, and FcyRIII subclasses, including allelic variants and alternatively spliced forms of
these receptors, FcyRII receptors include FcyRIIA (an "activating receptor") and FcyRIIB (an
"inhibiting receptor"), which have similar amino acid sequences that differ primarily in the
cytoplasmic domains thereof. Activating receptor FcyRIIA contains an immunoreceptor
tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) in its cytoplasmic domain. Inhibiting receptor
FcyRIIB contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif (ITIM) in its
cytoplasmic domain. (see M. Daeron, Annu. Rev. Immunol. 15:203-234 (1997). FcRs are
                                                    14

reviewed in Ravetch and Kinet, Annu. Rev. Immunol. 9: 457-92 (1991); Capel et al.,
Immunomethods 4: 25-34 (1994); and de Haas et al., J Lab. Clin. Med. 126: 330-41 (1995).
Other FcRs, including those to be identified in the future, are encompassed by the term
"FcR" herein.
[0058]          The terms "CDR", and its plural "CDRs", refer to a complementarity determining
region (CDR) of which three make up the binding character of a light chain variable region
(CDRLI, CDRL2 and CDRL3) and three make up the binding character of a heavy chain
variable region (CDRHI, CDRH2 and CDRH3). CDRs contribute to the functional activity
of an antibody molecule and are separated by amino acid sequences that comprise scaffolding
or framework regions. The exact definitional CDR boundaries and lengths are subject to
different classification and numbering systems. CDRs may therefore be referred to by Kabat,
Chothia, contact or any other boundary definitions, including the numbering system
described herein. Despite differing boundaries, each of these systems has some degree of
overlap in what constitutes the so called "hypervariable regions" within the variable
sequences. CDR definitions according to these systems may therefore differ in length and
boundary areas with respect to the adjacent framework region. See for example Kabat,
Chothia, and/or MacCallum et al., (Kabat et al., in "Sequences of Proteins of Immunological
Interest,"       5 th   Edition, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 1992; Chothia et al., J.
Mol. Biol., 1987, 196: 901; and MacCallum et al., J. Mol. Biol., 1996, 262: 732, each of
which is incorporated by reference in its entirety).
 [0059]         As used herein, the term "antigen-binding portion" of an antibody (or simply
"antibody portion"), refers to one or more fragments of an antibody that retain the ability to
specifically bind to an antigen (e.g., PD-1, PD-LI, and/or PD-L2). It has been shown that the
antigen-binding function of an antibody can be performed by fragments of a full-length
antibody. Examples of binding fragments encompassed within the term "antigen-binding
portion" of an antibody include (i) a Fab fragment, a monovalent fragment consisting of the
VH, VL,       CL and CHI domains; (ii) a F(ab') 2 fragment, a bivalent fragment comprising two
Fab fragments linked by a disulfide bridge at the hinge region; (iii) a Fd fragment consisting
of the VH and CHI domains; (iv) a Fv fragment consisting of the VH and VL domains of a
single arm of an antibody, (v) a dAb fragment (Ward et al., (1989) Nature 341:544 546),
which consists of a VH domain; and (vi) an isolated complementarity determining region
(CDR) or (vii) a combination of two or more isolated CDRs which may optionally be joined
by a synthetic linker. Furthermore, although the two domains of the Fv fragment, VH and VL,
                                                       15
10191856_1 (GHMatters) P86720.AU.4

are coded for by separate genes, they can be joined, using recombinant methods, by a
synthetic linker that enables them to be made as a single protein chain in which the VH and
VL regions pair to form monovalent molecules (known as single chain Fv (scFv); see e.g.,
Bird et al. (1988) Science 242:423 426; and Huston et al. (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA
85:5879 5883). Such single chain antibodies are also intended to be encompassed within the
term "antigen-binding portion" of an antibody. These antibody fragments are obtained using
conventional techniques known to those with skill in the art, and the fragments are screened
for utility in the same manner as are intact antibodies.
[0060]          Antibodies may be polyclonal or monoclonal; xenogeneic, allogeneic, or syngeneic;
or modified forms thereof (e.g., humanized, chimeric, etc.). Antibodies may also be fully
human. Preferably, antibodies of the invention bind specifically or substantially specifically
to PD-1, PD-Li, or PD-L2 polypeptides. The term "monoclonal antibody" as used herein,
refers to an antibody which displays a single binding specificity and affinity for a particular
epitope. Accordingly, the term "human monoclonal antibody" refers to an antibody which
displays a single binding specificity and which has variable and constant regions derived
from human germline or non-germline immunoglobulin sequences. In one embodiment,
human monoclonal antibodies are produced by a hybridoma which includes a B cell obtained
from a transgenic non-human animal, e.g., a transgenic mouse, having a genome comprising
a human heavy chain transgene and a light chain transgene fused to an immortalized cell.
[0061]          As used herein, the term an "isolated antibody" is intended to refer to an antibody
which is substantially free of other antibodies having different antigenic specificities (e.g., an
isolated antibody that specifically binds to PD-1, PD-L1, or PD-L2 is substantially free of
antibodies that do not bind to PD-1, PD-LI, or PD-L2, respectively). An isolated antibody
that specifically binds to an epitope of PD-1, PD-L1, and/or PD-L2 may, however, have
cross-reactivity to other PD-1, PD-Li, and/or PD-L2 proteins, respectively, from different
species. However, the antibody preferably always binds to human PD-1, PD-Li, and/or PD
L2. In addition, an isolated antibody is typically substantially free of other cellular material
and/or chemicals. In one embodiment of the invention, a combination of "isolated"
monoclonal antibodies having different specificities to PD-1, PD-Li, and/or PD-L2 are
combined in a well defined composition.
[0062]          As used herein, the term "humanized antibody" refers to an antibody that consists of
the CDR of antibodies derived from mammals other than human, and the FR region and the
constant region of a human antibody. A humanized antibody is useful as an effective
                                                     16
10191856_1 (GHMatters) P86720.AU.4

component in a therapeutic agent according to the present invention since antigenicity of the
humanized antibody in human body is lowered.
[0063]          As used herein, the term "composite antibody" refers to an antibody which has
variable regions comprising germline or non-germline immunoglobulin sequences from two
or more unrelated variable regions. Additionally, the term "composite, human antibody"
refers to an antibody which has constant regions derived from human germline or non
germline immunoglobulin sequences and variable regions comprising human germline or
non-germline sequences from two or more unrelated human variable regions. A composite,
human antibody is useful as an effective component in a therapeutic agent according to the
present invention since the antigenicity of the composite, human antibody in human body is
lowered.
[0064]          As used herein, the term "recombinant human antibody" includes all human
antibodies that are prepared, expressed, created or isolated by recombinant means, such as (a)
antibodies isolated from an animal (e.g., a mouse) that is transgenic or transchromosomal for
human immunoglobulin genes or a hybridoma prepared therefrom (described further in
Section I, below), (b) antibodies isolated from a host cell transformed to express the
antibody, e.g., from a transfectoma, (c) antibodies isolated from a recombinant, combinatorial
human antibody library, and (d) antibodies prepared, expressed, created or isolated by any
other means that involve splicing of human immunoglobulin gene sequences to other DNA
sequences. Such recombinant human antibodies have variable and constant regions derived
from human germline and/or non-germline immunoglobulin sequences. In certain
embodiments, however, such recombinant human antibodies can be subjected to in vitro
mutagenesis (or, when an animal transgenic for human Ig sequences is used, in vivo somatic
mutagenesis) and thus the amino acid sequences of the VH and VL regions of the recombinant
antibodies are sequences that, while derived from and related to human germline VH and VL
sequences, may not naturally exist within the human antibody germline repertoire in vivo.
[0065]          As used herein, the term "heterologous antibody" is defined in relation to the
transgenic non-human organism producing such an antibody. This term refers to an antibody
having an amino acid sequence or an encoding nucleic acid sequence corresponding to that
found in an organism not consisting of the transgenic non-human animal, and generally from
a species other than that of the transgenic non-human animal.
[0066]          As used herein, the term "KD" is intended to refer to the dissociation equilibrium
constant of a particular antibody-antigen interaction.

10191856_1 (GHMatters) P86720.AU.4

[0067]          As used herein, the term "specific binding" refers to antibody binding to a
predetermined antigen. Typically, the antibody binds with an affinity (KD) of approximately
less than 10-7 M, such as approximately less than 10-8 M, 10-9 M or 1010 M or even lower
when determined by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technology in a BIACORE 3000
instrument using recombinant human PD-1, PD-L1, or PD-L2 as the analyte and the antibody
as the ligand, and binds to the predetermined antigen with an affinity that is at least 1.1-, 1.2-,
 1.3-, 1.4-, 1.5-, 1.6-, 1.7-, 1.8-, 1.9-, 2.0-, 2.5-, 3.0-, 3.5-, 4.0-, 4.5-, 5.0-, 6.0-, 7.0-, 8.0-, 9.0-,
or 10.0-fold or greater than its affinity for binding to a non-specific antigen (e.g., BSA,
casein) other than the predetermined antigen or a closely-related antigen. The phrases "an
antibody recognizing an antigen" and "an antibody specific for an antigen" are used
interchangeably herein with the term "an antibody which binds specifically to an antigen".
[0068]          As used herein, the term "isotype" refers to the antibody class (e.g., IgM or IgGI)
that is encoded by heavy chain constant region genes.
[0069]          As used herein, the term "glycosylation pattern" is defined as the pattern of
carbohydrate units that are covalently attached to a protein, more specifically to an
immunoglobulin protein. A glycosylation pattern of a heterologous antibody can be
characterized as being substantially similar to glycosylation patterns which occur naturally on
antibodies produced by the species of the nonhuman transgenic animal, when one of ordinary
skill in the art would recognize the glycosylation pattern of the heterologous antibody as
being more similar to said pattern of glycosylation in the species of the nonhuman transgenic
animal than to the species from which the CH genes of the transgene were derived.
[0070]          As used herein, the term "naturally-occurring" as applied to an object refers to the
fact that an object can be found in nature. For example, a polypeptide or polynucleotide
sequence that is present in an organism (including viruses) that can be isolated from a source
in nature and which has not been intentionally modified by man in the laboratory is naturally
occurring.
[0071]          As used herein, the term "rearranged" refers to a configuration of a heavy chain or
light chain immunoglobulin locus wherein a V segment is positioned immediately adjacent to
a D-J or J segment in a conformation encoding essentially a complete VH and VL domain,
respectively. A rearranged immunoglobulin gene locus can be identified by comparison to
germline DNA; a rearranged locus will have at least one recombined heptamer/nonamer
homology element.
                                                      18
10191856_1 (GHMatters) P86720.AU.4

[0072]          As used herein, the term "unrearranged" or "germline configuration" in reference to
a V segment refers to the configuration wherein the V segment is not recombined so as to be
immediately adjacent to a D or J segment.
[0073]          As used herein, the term "nucleic acid molecule" is intended to include DNA
molecules and RNA molecules. A nucleic acid molecule may be single-stranded or double
stranded, but preferably is double-stranded DNA.
[0074]          As used herein, the term "isolated nucleic acid molecule" in reference to nucleic
acids encoding antibodies or antibody portions (e.g., VH, VL, CDR3) that bind to PD-1, PD
LI, or PD-L2, is intended to refer to a nucleic acid molecule in which the nucleotide
sequences encoding the antibody or antibody portion are free of other nucleotide sequences
encoding antibodies or antibody portions that bind antigens other than PD-1, PD-L1, or PD
L2, respectively, which other sequences may naturally flank the nucleic acid in human
genomic DNA. Figures 2-7 correspond to the nucleotide and amino acid sequences
comprising the heavy chain (VH) and light chain (VL) variable regions of the human anti-PD
 1, PD-LI, or PD-L2 antibodies of the present invention, respectively.
[0075]          The present invention also encompasses "conservative sequence modifications" of
the sequences set forth in the figures (e.g., Figures 2-7), including nucleotide and amino acid
sequence modifications which do not significantly affect or alter the binding characteristics
of the antibody encoded by the nucleotide sequence or containing the amino acid sequence.
Such conservative sequence modifications include nucleotide and amino acid substitutions,
additions and deletions. Modifications can be introduced into the sequence set forth in the
figures (e.g., Figures 2-7) by standard techniques known in the art, such as site-directed
mutagenesis and PCR-mediated mutagenesis. Conservative amino acid substitutions include
ones in which the amino acid residue is replaced with an amino acid residue having a similar
side chain. Families of amino acid residues having similar side chains have been defined in
the art. These families include amino acids with basic side chains (e.g., lysine, arginine,
histidine), acidic side chains (e.g., aspartic acid, glutamic acid), uncharged polar side chains
(e.g., glycine, asparagine, glutamine, serine, threonine, tyrosine, cysteine, tryptophan),
nonpolar side chains (e.g., alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, proline, phenylalanine,
methionine), beta-branched side chains (e.g., threonine, valine, isoleucine) and aromatic side
chains (e.g., tyrosine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, histidine). Thus, a predicted nonessential
amino acid residue in a human anti-PD-1, anti-PD-Li, or anti-PD-L2 antibody is preferably
replaced with another amino acid residue from the same side chain family.
                                                     19

[0076]          Alternatively, in another embodiment, mutations can be introduced randomly along
all or part of a human anti-PD-1, PD-L1, or PD-L2 antibody coding sequence, such as by
saturation mutagenesis, and the resulting modified human anti-PD-1, anti-PD-Li, or anti-PD
L2 antibodies can be screened for binding activity.
[0077]          Accordingly, antibodies encoded by the heavy and light chain variable region
nucleotide sequences disclosed herein and/or containing the heavy and light chain variable
region amino acid sequences disclosed herein (e.g., Figures 2-7) include substantially similar
antibodies encoded by or containing similar sequences which have been conservatively
modified. Further discussion as to how such substantially similar antibodies can be generated
based on the sequences (i.e., heavy and light chain variable regions) disclosed herein (e.g.,
Figures 2-7) is provided below.
[0078]          In addition, there is a known and definite correspondence between the amino acid
sequence of a particular protein and the nucleotide sequences that can code for the protein, as
defined by the genetic code (shown below). Likewise, there is a known and definite
correspondence between the nucleotide sequence of a particular nucleic acid and the amino
acid sequence encoded by that nucleic acid, as defined by the genetic code.

[0079]          An important and well known feature of the genetic code is its redundancy,
whereby, for most of the amino acids used to make proteins, more than one coding nucleotide
triplet may be employed (illustrated above). Therefore, a number of different nucleotide
sequences may code for a given amino acid sequence. Such nucleotide sequences are
considered functionally equivalent since they result in the production of the same amino acid
sequence in all organisms (although certain organisms may translate some sequences more
efficiently than they do others). Moreover, occasionally, a methylated variant of a purine or
pyrimidine may be found in a given nucleotide sequence. Such methylations do not affect
the coding relationship between the trinucleotide codon and the corresponding amino acid.
[0080]          For nucleic acids, the term "substantial homology" indicates that two nucleic acids,
or designated sequences thereof, when optimally aligned and compared, are identical, with
appropriate nucleotide insertions or deletions, in at least about 80% of the nucleotides,
usually at least about 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, or more of the nucleotides, and
more preferably at least about 97%, 98%, 99% or more of the nucleotides. Alternatively,
substantial homology exists when the segments will hybridize under selective hybridization
conditions, to the complement of the strand.
[0081]          The percent identity between two sequences is a function of the number of identical
positions shared by the sequences (i.e., % identity= # of identical positions/total # of
positions x 100), taking into account the number of gaps, and the length of each gap, which
need to be introduced for optimal alignment of the two sequences. The comparison of
sequences and determination of percent identity between two sequences can be accomplished
using a mathematical algorithm, as described in the non-limiting examples below.
[0082]          The percent identity between two nucleotide sequences can be determined using the
GAP program in the GCG software package (available on the world wide web at the GCG
company website), using a NWSgapdna.CMP matrix and a gap weight of 40, 50, 60, 70, or
80 and a length weight of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. The percent identity between two nucleotide or
amino acid sequences can also be determined using the algorithm of E. Meyers and W. Miller
(CABIOS, 4:11 17 (1989)) which has been incorporated into the ALIGN program (version
                                                     21
10191856_1 (GHMatters) P86720.AU.4

2.0), using a PAM 120 weight residue table, a gap length penalty of 12 and a gap penalty of 4.
In addition, the percent identity between two amino acid sequences can be determined using
the Needleman and Wunsch (J. Mol. Biol. (48):444 453 (1970)) algorithm which has been
incorporated into the GAP program in the GCG software package (available on the world
wide web at the GCG company website), using either a Blosum 62 matrix or a PAM250
matrix, and a gap weight of 16, 14, 12, 10, 8, 6, or 4 and a length weight of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.
[0083]          The nucleic acid and protein sequences of the present invention can further be used
as a "query sequence" to perform a search against public databases to, for example, identify
related sequences. Such searches can be performed using the NBLAST and XBLAST
programs (version 2.0) of Altschul, et al. (1990) J. Mol. Biol. 215:403 10. BLAST nucleotide
searches can be performed with the NBLAST program, score=100, wordlength=12 to obtain
nucleotide sequences homologous to the nucleic acid molecules of the invention. BLAST
protein searches can be performed with the XBLAST program, score=50, wordlength=3 to
obtain amino acid sequences homologous to the protein molecules of the invention. To
obtain gapped alignments for comparison purposes, Gapped BLAST can be utilized as
described in Altschul et al., (1997) Nucleic Acids Res. 25(17):3389 3402. When utilizing
BLAST and Gapped BLAST programs, the default parameters of the respective programs
(e.g., XBLAST and NBLAST) can be used (available on the world wide web at the NCBI
website).
[0084]          The nucleic acids may be present in whole cells, in a cell lysate, or in a partially
purified or substantially pure form. A nucleic acid is "isolated" or "rendered substantially
pure" when purified away from other cellular components or other contaminants, e.g., other
cellular nucleic acids or proteins, by standard techniques, including alkaline/SDS treatment,
CsCl banding, column chromatography, agarose gel electrophoresis and others well known in
the art. See, F. Ausubel, et al., ed. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Greene
Publishing and Wiley Interscience, New York (1987).
[0085]          The nucleic acid compositions of the present invention, while often in a native
sequence (except for modified restriction sites and the like), from either cDNA, genomic or
mixtures thereof may be mutated, in accordance with standard techniques to provide gene
sequences. For coding sequences, these mutations, may affect amino acid sequence as
desired. In particular, DNA sequences substantially homologous to or derived from native V,
D, J, constant, switches and other such sequences described herein are contemplated (where
"derived" indicates that a sequence is identical or modified from another sequence).
                                                    22
10191856_1 (GHMatters) P86720.AU.4

[0086]          A nucleic acid is "operably linked" when it is placed into a functional relationship
with another nucleic acid sequence. For instance, a promoter or enhancer is operably linked
to a coding sequence if it affects the transcription of the sequence. With respect to
transcription regulatory sequences, operably linked means that the DNA sequences being
linked are contiguous and, where necessary to join two protein coding regions, contiguous
and in reading frame. For switch sequences, operably linked indicates that the sequences are
capable of effecting switch recombination.
[0087]          As used herein, the term "vector" is intended to refer to a nucleic acid molecule
capable of transporting another nucleic acid to which it has been linked. One type of vector
is a "plasmid", which refers to a circular double stranded DNA loop into which additional
DNA segments may be ligated. Another type of vector is a viral vector, wherein additional
DNA segments may be ligated into the viral genome. Certain vectors are capable of
autonomous replication in a host cell into which they are introduced (e.g., bacterial vectors
having a bacterial origin of replication and episomal mammalian vectors). Other vectors
(e.g., non-episomal mammalian vectors) can be integrated into the genome of a host cell
upon introduction into the host cell, and thereby are replicated along with the host genome.
Moreover, certain vectors are capable of directing the expression of genes to which they are
operatively linked. Such vectors are referred to herein as "recombinant expression vectors"
(or simply, "expression vectors"). In general, expression vectors of utility in recombinant
DNA techniques are often in the form of plasmids. In the present specification, "plasmid"
and "vector" may be used interchangeably as the plasmid is the most commonly used form of
vector. However, the invention is intended to include such other forms of expression vectors,
such as viral vectors (e.g., replication defective retroviruses, adenoviruses and adeno
associated viruses), which serve equivalent functions.
[0088]          As used herein, the term "recombinant host cell" (or simply "host cell"), is intended
to refer to a cell into which a recombinant expression vector has been introduced. It should
be understood that such terms are intended to refer not only to the particular subject cell but
to the progeny of such a cell. Because certain modifications may occur in succeeding
generations due to either mutation or environmental influences, such progeny may not, in
fact, be identical to the parent cell, but are still included within the scope of the term "host
cell" as used herein.
[0089]          As used herein, the term "subject" includes any human or non-human animal. For
example, the methods and compositions of the present invention can be used to treat a subject
                                                     23
10191856_1 (GHMatters) P86720.AU.4

with an inflammatory disease, such as arthritis, e.g., rheumatoid arthritis. The term "non
human animal" includes all vertebrates, e.g., mammals and non-mammals, such as non
human primates, sheep, dog, cow, chickens, amphibians, reptiles, etc.
[0090]          As used herein, the term "modulate" includes up-regulation and down-regulation,
e.g., enhancing or inhibiting a response.
[0091]          As used herein, the term "inhibit" includes the decrease, limitation, or blockage, of,
for example a particular action, function, or interaction.
[0092]          As used herein, the term "immune cell" refers to cells that play a role in the immune
response. Immune cells are of hematopoietic origin, and include lymphocytes, such as B
cells and T cells; natural killer cells; myeloid cells, such as monocytes, macrophages,
eosinophils, mast cells, basophils, and granulocytes.
[0093]          As used herein, the term "T cell" includes CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells. The
term T cell also includes T helper 1 type T cells, T helper 2 type T cells, T helper 17 type T
cells and inhibitory T cells. The term "antigen presenting cell" includes professional antigen
presenting cells (e.g., B lymphocytes, monocytes, dendritic cells, Langerhans cells) as well as
other antigen presenting cells (e.g., keratinocytes, endothelial cells, astrocytes, fibroblasts,
oligodendrocytes).
[0094]          As used herein, the term "immune response" includes T cell mediated and/or B cell
mediated immune responses that are influenced by modulation of T cell costimulation.
Exemplary immune responses include T cell responses, e.g., cytokine production, and
cellular cytotoxicity. In addition, the term immune response includes immune responses that
are indirectly affected by T cell activation, e.g., antibody production (humoral responses) and
activation of cytokine responsive cells, e.g., macrophages.
[0095]          As used herein, the term "costimulate," as used with reference to activated immune
cells, includes the ability of a costimulatory polypeptide to provide a second, non-activating
receptor mediated signal (a "costimulatory signal") that induces proliferation and/or effector
function. For example, a costimulatory signal can result in cytokine secretion, e.g., in a T
cell that has received a T cell-receptor-mediated signal. Immune cells that have received a
cell-receptor mediated signal, e.g., via an activating receptor are referred to herein as
"activated immune cells."
[0096]          As used herein, the term "inhibitory signal" refers to a signal transmitted via an
inhibitory receptor (e.g., CTLA4 or PD-1) for a polypeptide on an immune cell. Such a
signal antagonizes a signal via an activating receptor (e.g., via a TCR or CD3 polypeptide)
                                                     24
10191856_1 (GHMatters) P86720.AU.4

and can result in, e.g., inhibition of second messenger generation; an inhibition of
proliferation; an inhibition of effector function in the immune cell, e.g., reduced
phagocytosis, reduced antibody production, reduced cellular cytotoxicity, the failure of the
immune cell to produce mediators, (such as cytokines (e.g., IL-2) and/or mediators of allergic
responses); or the development of anergy.
[0097]          As used herein, the term "unresponsiveness" includes refractivity of immune cells
to stimulation, e.g., stimulation via an activating receptor or a cytokine. Unresponsiveness
can occur, e.g., because of exposure to immunosuppressants or exposure to high doses of
antigen. As used herein, the term "anergy" or "tolerance" includes refractivity to activating
receptor-mediated stimulation. Such refractivity is generally antigen-specific and persists
after exposure to the tolerizing antigen has ceased. For example, anergy in T cells (as
opposed to unresponsiveness) is characterized by lack of cytokine production, e.g., IL-2. T
cell anergy occurs when T cells are exposed to antigen and receive a first signal (a T cell
receptor or CD-3 mediated signal) in the absence of a second signal (a costimulatory signal).
Under these conditions, reexposure of the cells to the same antigen (even if reexposure occurs
in the presence of a costimulatory polypeptide) results in failure to produce cytokines and,
thus, failure to proliferate. Anergic T cells can, however, proliferate if cultured with
cytokines (e.g., IL-2). For example, T cell anergy can also be observed by the lack of IL-2
production by T lymphocytes as measured by ELISA or by a proliferation assay using an
indicator cell line. Alternatively, a reporter gene construct can be used. For example, anergic
T cells fail to initiate IL-2 gene transcription induced by a heterologous promoter under the
control of the 5' IL-2 gene enhancer or by a multimer of the API sequence that can be found
within the enhancer (Kang et al. (1992) Science 257:1134).
[0098]          As used herein, the term "activity," when used with respect to a polypeptide, e.g.,
PD-1, PD-Li, or PD-L2 polypeptide, includes activities which are inherent in the structure of
the protein. For example, with regard to PD-I ligand, the term "activity" includes the ability
to modulate immune cell costimulation (e.g. by modulating a costimulatory signal in an
activated immune cell) or to modulate inhibition by modulating an inhibitory signal in an
immune cell (e.g., by engaging a natural receptor on an immune cell). Those of skill in the
art will recognize that when a PD-1 ligand polypeptide binds to a costimulatory receptor, a
costimulatory signal can be generated in the immune cell. When a PD-1 ligand polypeptide
binds to an inhibitory receptor, an inhibitory signal is generated in the immune cell. Also,
                                                     25
10191856_1 (GHMatters) P86720.AU.4

when a PD-I ligand binds to a B7-1 polypeptide, an inhibitory signal can be generated (Butte
et al. (2007) Immunity 27:111).
[0099]          With respect to PD-1, the term "activity" includes the ability of a PD-I polypeptide
to modulate an inhibitory signal in an immune cell, e.g., by engaging a natural PD-I ligand
on an antigen presenting cell. PD-I transmits an inhibitory signal to an immune cell in a
manner similar to CTLA4. Modulation of an inhibitory signal in an immune cell results in
modulation of proliferation of, and/or cytokine secretion by, an immune cell. Thus, the term
"PD-I activity" includes the ability of a PD-I polypeptide to bind its natural ligand(s), the
ability to modulate immune cell costimulatory or inhibitory signals, and the ability to
modulate the immune response.
[00100] As used herein, the term "interaction", when referring to an interaction between two
molecules, refers to the physical contact (e.g., binding) of the molecules with one another.
Generally, such an interaction results in an activity (which produces a biological effect) of
one or both of said molecules. The activity may be a direct activity of one or both of the
molecules, (e.g., signal transduction). Alternatively, one or both molecules in the interaction
may be prevented from binding a ligand, and thus be held inactive with respect to ligand
binding activity (e.g., binding its ligand and triggering or inhibiting costimulation). To
inhibit such an interaction results in the disruption of the activity of one or more molecules
involved in the interaction. To enhance such an interaction is to prolong or increase the
likelihood of said physical contact, and prolong or increase the likelihood of said activity.
[00101] As used herein the singular forms "a", "an", and "the" include plural referents
unless the context clearly dictates otherwise.
[00102] It is understood that aspects and embodiments of the invention described herein
include "consisting" and/or "consisting essentially of' aspects and embodiments.
[0100]          Various aspects of the invention are described in further detail in the following
subsections.
I.           Isolated Nucleic Acid Molecules
[0101]            One aspect of the invention pertains to isolated nucleic acid molecules that encode
polypeptides of the present invention (e.g., those in Figures 2-7) or biologically active
portions thereof, as well as nucleic acid fragments sufficient for use as hybridization probes
to identify nucleic acid molecules encoding these polypeptides and fragments for use as PCR
primers for the amplification or mutation of the nucleic acid molecules. As used herein, the
                                                      26
10191856_1 (GHMatters) P86720.AU.4

term "nucleic acid molecule" is intended to include DNA molecules (e.g., cDNA or genomic
DNA) and RNA molecules (e.g., mRNA) and analogs of the DNA or RNA generated using
nucleotide analogs. The nucleic acid molecule can be single-stranded or double-stranded, but
preferably is double-stranded DNA.
 [0102]           The term "isolated nucleic acid molecule" includes nucleic acid molecules which
are separated from other nucleic acid molecules which are present in the natural source of the
nucleic acid. For example, with regards to genomic DNA, the term "isolated" includes
nucleic acid molecules which are separated from the chromosome with which the genomic
DNA is naturally associated. Preferably, an "isolated" nucleic acid molecule is free of
sequences which naturally flank the nucleic acid (i.e., sequences located at the 5' and 3' ends
of the nucleic acid molecule) in the genomic DNA of the organism from which the nucleic
acid is derived. For example, an "isolated" nucleic acid molecule, such as a cDNA molecule,
can be substantially free of other cellular material, or culture medium, when produced by
recombinant techniques, or substantially free of chemical precursors or other chemicals when
chemically synthesized.
 [0103]         A nucleic acid molecule of the present invention (e.g., those in Figures 2-7), or a
portion thereof, can be isolated using standard molecular biology techniques and the
sequence information provided herein. For example, a nucleic acid molecule encompassing
all or a portion of sequences shown in Figures 2-7 can be isolated by the polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) using synthetic oligonucleotide primers designed based upon the sequences
shown in Figures 2-7.
 [0104]         A nucleic acid molecule of the invention can be amplified using cDNA, mRNA or,
alternatively, genomic DNA as a template and appropriate oligonucleotide primers according
to standard PCR amplification techniques. The nucleic acid molecule so amplified can be
cloned into an appropriate vector and characterized by DNA sequence analysis. Furthermore,
oligonucleotides corresponding to nucleic acid sequences of the invention can be prepared by
standard synthetic techniques, e.g., using an automated DNA synthesizer.
 [0105]         In another embodiment, an isolated nucleic acid molecule of the invention
comprises a nucleic acid molecule which is a complement of a nucleic acid molecule of the
present invention (e.g., those in Figures 2-7), or a portion thereof. A nucleic acid molecule
which is complementary to a nucleic acid molecule of the present invention (e.g., those in
Figures 2-7), or a portion thereof, is one which is sufficiently complementary to the
                                                     27
10191856_1 (GHMatters) P86720.AU.4

nucleotide sequence shown in Figures 2-7, such that it can hybridize to the respective
nucleotide sequence shown in Figures 2-7, thereby forming a stable duplex.
[0106]          In still another embodiment, an isolated nucleic acid molecule of the present
invention comprises a nucleotide sequence which is at least about 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%,
90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or more identical to the entire
length of the nucleotide sequence shown in Figures 2-7, or a portion of any of these
nucleotide sequences.
[0107]          Moreover, the nucleic acid molecule of the invention can comprise only a portion of
a nucleic acid molecule of the present invention (e.g., those in Figures 2-7), or a portion
thereof, for example, a fragment which can be used as a probe or primer or a fragment which
encodes a portion of a polypeptide of the invention, e.g., those in Figures 2-7. The
probe/primer typically comprises substantially purified oligonucleotide. The oligonucleotide
typically comprises a region of nucleotide sequence that hybridizes under stringent
conditions to at least about 12 or 15, preferably about 20 or 25, more preferably about 30, 35,
40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, or 75 consecutive nucleotides of a nucleic acid molecule of the present
invention (e.g., those in Figures 2-7); of an anti-sense sequence of a nucleic acid molecule of
the present invention (e.g., those in Figures 2-7); or of a mutant of a nucleic acid molecule of
the present invention (e.g., those in Figures 2-7).
[0108]          Probes based on a nucleic acid molecule of the present invention (e.g., those in
Figures 2-7) can be used to detect transcripts or genomic sequences encoding the same or
homologous polypeptides. In one embodiment, the probe further comprises a label group
attached thereto, e.g., the label group can be a radioisotope, a fluorescent compound, an
enzyme, or an enzyme co-factor.
 [0109]         A nucleic acid fragment encoding a "biologically active portion of a polypeptide of
the invention" can be prepared by isolating a portion of the nucleotide sequence of a nucleic
acid molecule of the present invention (e.g., those in Figures 2-7) which encodes a
polypeptide having a biological activity of a polypeptide of the invention (e.g., the ability to
bind to its antigenic target), expressing the encoded portion of the polypeptide of the
invention (e.g., by recombinant expression in vitro) and assessing the activity of the encoded
portion of the polypeptide of the invention.
[0110]          The invention further encompasses nucleic acid molecules that differ from
nucleotide sequence(s) shown in Figures 2-7 due to degeneracy of the genetic code and thus
encode the same polypeptides as those encoded by the respective nucleotide sequence shown
                                                     28
10191856_1 (GHMatters) P86720.AU.4

in Figures 2-7. In another embodiment, an isolated nucleic acid molecule of the invention
has a nucleotide sequence encoding a polypeptide of the present invention (e.g., those in
Figures 2-7).
[0111]          Nucleic acid molecules corresponding to homologues of a nucleic acid molecule of
the present invention (e.g., those in Figures 2-7) can be isolated based on their homology to
the nucleic acids disclosed herein using the cDNAs disclosed herein, or a portion thereof, as a
hybridization probe according to standard hybridization techniques under stringent
hybridization conditions.
[0112]          Accordingly, in another embodiment, an isolated nucleic acid molecule of the
invention is at least 15, 20, 25, 30 or more nucleotides in length and hybridizes under
stringent conditions to the nucleic acid molecule comprising a nucleic acid molecule of the
present invention (e.g., those in Figures 2-7).
[0113]          As used herein, the term "hybridizes under stringent conditions" is intended to
describe conditions for hybridization and washing under which nucleotide sequences that are
significantly identical or homologous to each other remain hybridized to each other.
Preferably, the conditions are such that sequences at least about 70%, more preferably at least
about 80%, even more preferably at least about 85% or 90% identical to each other remain
hybridized to each other. Such stringent conditions are known to those skilled in the art and
can be found in Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Ausubel et al., eds., John Wiley &
Sons, Inc. (1995), sections 2, 4 and 6. Additional stringent conditions can be found in
Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Sambrook et al., Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold
Spring Harbor, N.Y. (1989), chapters 7, 9 and 11. A non-limiting example of stringent
hybridization conditions includes hybridization in 4x or 6x sodium chloride/sodium citrate
(SSC), at about 65-70'C (or hybridization in 4x SSC plus 50% formamide at about 42-50'C)
followed by one or more washes in 1x SSC, at about 65-70'C. A further non-limiting
example of stringent hybridization conditions includes hybridization at 6x SSC at 45 C,
followed by one or more washes in 0.2x SSC, 0. 1% SDS at 65'C. A non-limiting example of
highly stringent hybridization conditions includes hybridization in 1x SSC, at about 65-70'C
(or hybridization in 1x SSC plus 50% formamide at about 42-50'C) followed by one or more
washes in 0.3x SSC, at about 65-70'C. A non-limiting example of reduced stringency
hybridization conditions includes hybridization in 4x or 6x SSC, at about 50-60'C (or
alternatively hybridization in 6x SSC plus 50% formamide at about 40-45'C) followed by
                                                    29
10191856_1 (GHMatters) P86720.AU.4

one or more washes in 2x, at about 50-60'C. Ranges intermediate to the above-recited
values, e.g., at 65-70'C or at 42-50'C are also intended to be encompassed by the present
invention. SSPE (1x SSPE is 0.15M NaCl, 10mM NaH 2PO 4, and 1.25 mM EDTA, pH 7.4)
can be substituted for SSC (1x SSC is 0.15M NaCl and 15mM sodium citrate) in the
hybridization and wash buffers; washes are performed for 15 minutes each after hybridization
is complete. The hybridization temperature for hybrids anticipated to be less than 50 base
pairs in length should be 5-10 C less than the melting temperature (Tm) of the hybrid, where
Tm is determined according to the following equations. For hybrids less than 18 base pairs in
length, Tm ('C) =2(# of A + T bases)+4(# of G +C bases). For hybrids between 18 and 49
base pairs in length, Tm ('C) =81.5+16.6(logio[Na+])+0.41(%G+C)-(600/N), where N is the
number of bases in the hybrid, and [Na*] is the concentration of sodium ions in the
hybridization buffer ([Na+] for 1x SSC=0. 165 M). It will also be recognized by the skilled
practitioner that additional reagents may be added to hybridization and/or wash buffers to
decrease non-specific hybridization of nucleic acid molecules to membranes, for example,
nitrocellulose or nylon membranes, including but not limited to blocking agents (e.g., BSA or
salmon or herring sperm carrier DNA), detergents (e.g., SDS), chelating agents (e.g., EDTA),
Ficoll, PVP and the like. When using nylon membranes, in particular, an additional non
limiting example of stringent hybridization conditions is hybridization in 0.25-0.5M
NaH 2PO 4 , 7% SDS at about 65'C, followed by one or more washes at 0.02M NaH 2 PO 4 , 1%
SDS at 65'C, see e.g., Church and Gilbert (1984) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 81:1991-1995
(or alternatively 0.2x SSC, 1% SDS).
[0114]          The skilled artisan will further appreciate that changes can be introduced by
mutation into a nucleic acid molecule of the present invention (e.g., those in Figures 2-7),
thereby leading to changes in the amino acid sequence of the encoded polypeptides of the
present invention, without altering the functional ability of the polypeptides. For example,
nucleotide substitutions leading to amino acid substitutions at "non-essential" amino acid
residues can be made in a nucleic acid molecule of the present invention (e.g., those in
Figures 2-7). A "non-essential" amino acid residue is a residue that can be altered from a
nucleic acid molecule of the present invention (e.g., those in Figures 2-7) without altering the
biological activity, whereas an "essential" amino acid residue is required for biological
activity. For example, amino acid residues that are conserved among the polypeptides of the
                                                      30
10191856_1 (GHMatters) P86720.AU.4

present invention, e.g., those required for binding of the polypeptides to its target antigen, are
predicted to be particularly unamenable to alteration.
[0115]          Accordingly, another aspect of the invention pertains to nucleic acid molecules
encoding polypeptides of the present invention (e.g., those in Figures 2-7) that contain
changes in amino acid residues that are not essential for activity. Such polypeptides differ in
amino acid sequence from those in Figures 2-7, yet retain biological activity. In one
embodiment, the isolated nucleic acid molecule comprises a nucleotide sequence encoding a
polypeptide, wherein the polypeptide comprises an amino acid sequence at least about 710%,
75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 91%, 92%,            9 3 %, 94 %, 9 5 %, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or more identical
to those in Figures 2-7.
[0116]          An isolated nucleic acid molecule encoding a polypeptide identical to the
polypeptides of those in Figures 2-7 can be created by introducing one or more nucleotide
substitutions, additions or deletions into the nucleotide sequence of those in Figures 2-7 such
that one or more amino acid substitutions, additions or deletions are introduced into the
encoded polypeptide. Mutations can be introduced into nucleic acid molecules of the present
invention (e.g., those in Figures 2-7) by standard techniques, such as site-directed
mutagenesis and PCR-mediated mutagenesis. In one embodiment, conservative amino acid
substitutions are made at one or more predicted non-essential amino acid residues. A
"conservative amino acid substitution" is one in which the amino acid residue is replaced
with an amino acid residue having a similar side chain. Families of amino acid residues
having similar side chains have been defined in the art. These families include amino acids
with basic side chains (e.g., lysine, arginine, histidine), acidic side chains (e.g., aspartic acid,
glutamic acid), uncharged polar side chains (e.g., asparagine, glutamine, serine, threonine,
tyrosine, cysteine), nonpolar side chains (e.g., glycine, alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine,
proline, phenylalanine, methionine, tryptophan), beta-branched side chains (e.g., threonine,
valine, isoleucine) and aromatic side chains (e.g., tyrosine, phenylalanine, tryptophan,
histidine). Thus, a predicted nonessential amino acid residue in a polypeptide of the
invention (e.g., those in Figures 2-7) can be replaced with another amino acid residue from
the same side chain family. Alternatively, in another embodiment, mutations can be
introduced randomly along all or part of a nucleic acid molecule(s) of the present invention
(e.g., those in Figures 2-7), such as by saturation mutagenesis, and the resultant mutants can
be screened for biological activity to identify mutants that retain activity. Following
mutagenesis of a nucleic acid molecule of the present invention (e.g., those in Figures 2-7),
                                                    31
10191856_1 (GHMatters) P86720.AU.4

the encoded polypeptide can be expressed recombinantly and the activity of the polypeptide
can be determined.
[0117]          In one embodiment, a mutant polypeptide of the invention can be assayed for the
ability to bind to and/or modulate the activity of a natural PD-I (e.g., PD-I ligands) or PD-I
ligand partner (e.g., PD-I and B7-1), modulate intra- or intercellular signaling, modulate
activation of T lymphocytes, and/or modulate the immune response of an organism.
[0118]          Yet another aspect of the invention pertains to isolated nucleic acid molecules
encoding fusion proteins. Such nucleic acid molecules, comprising at least a first nucleotide
sequence encoding a polypeptide of the invention (e.g., those in Figures 2-7) operatively
linked to a second nucleotide sequence encoding a polypeptide of the invention (e.g., those in
Figures 2-7) can be prepared by standard recombinant DNA techniques.
[0119]          The expression characteristics of a nucleic acid molecules of the present invention
(e.g., those in Figures 2-7) within a cell line or microorganism may be modified by inserting
a heterologous DNA regulatory element into the genome of a stable cell line or cloned
microorganism such that the inserted regulatory element is operatively linked with the a
nucleic acid molecules of the present invention (e.g., those in Figures 2-7). For example, a
heterologous regulatory element may be inserted into a stable cell line or cloned
microorganism, such that it is operatively linked with a nucleic acid molecules of the present
invention (e.g., those in Figures 2-7), using techniques, such as targeted homologous
recombination, which are well known to those of skill in the art, and described, e.g., in
Chappel, U.S. Pat. No. 5,272,071; PCT publication No. WO 91/06667, published May 16,
 1991.
II.          Isolated Polypeptide Molecules
[0120]          One aspect of the invention pertains to isolated polypeptides of the present
invention (including antibodies and antigen-binding fragments thereof described herein, and
those in Figures 2-7), and biologically active portions thereof. In one embodiment,
polypeptides of the present invention (e.g., those in Figures 2-7), and biologically active
portions thereof can be isolated from cells or tissue sources by an appropriate purification
scheme using standard protein purification techniques. In another embodiment, polypeptides
of the present invention (e.g., those in Figures 2-7), and biologically active portions thereof
are produced by recombinant DNA techniques. Alternatively, polypeptides of the present
                                                     32
10191856_1 (GHMatters) P86720.AU.4

invention (e.g., those in Figures 2-7), and biologically active portions thereof can be
chemically synthesized using standard peptide synthesis techniques.
[0121]          An "isolated" or "purified" polypeptide or biologically active portion thereof is
substantially free of cellular material or other contaminating proteins from the cell or tissue
source from which the polypeptides of the present invention (e.g., those in Figures 2-7) is
derived, or substantially free from chemical precursors or other chemicals when chemically
synthesized. The language "substantially free of cellular material" includes preparations of
polypeptide(s) of the present invention (e.g., those in Figures 2-7), and biologically active
portions thereof, in which the polypeptide is separated from cellular components of the cells
from which it is isolated or recombinantly produced. In one embodiment, the language
"substantially free of cellular material" includes preparations of polypeptide(s) of the present
invention (e.g., those in Figures 2-7), and biologically active portions thereof having less than
about 30% (by dry weight) of proteins not of the present invention (also referred to herein as
a "contaminating protein"), more preferably less than about 20% of proteins not of the
present invention, still more preferably less than about 10% of proteins not of the present
invention, and most preferably less than about 5% of proteins not of the present invention.
When polypeptides of the present invention (e.g., those in Figures 2-7) or biologically active
portion thereof are recombinantly produced, it is also preferably substantially free of culture
medium, i.e., culture medium represents less than about 20%, more preferably less than about
10%, and most preferably less than about 5% of the volume of the protein preparation.
[0122]          The language "substantially free of chemical precursors or other chemicals"
includes preparations of polypeptide(s) of the present invention (e.g., those in Figures 2-7) or
biologically active portion thereof in which the polypeptide is separated from chemical
precursors or other chemicals which are involved in the synthesis of the polypeptide. In one
embodiment, the language "substantially free of chemical precursors or other chemicals"
includes preparations of polypeptide(s) of the present invention (e.g., those in Figures 2-7) or
biologically active portion thereof having less than about 30% (by dry weight) of chemical
precursors or of proteins not of the present invention, more preferably less than about 20%
chemical precursors or of proteins not of the present invention, still more preferably less than
about 10% chemical precursors or of proteins not of the present invention, and most
preferably less than about 5% chemical precursors or of proteins not of the present invention.
[0123]          As used herein, a "biologically active portion" of polypeptide(s) of the present
invention (e.g., those in Figures 2-7) include polypeptides which participates in an interaction
                                                     33
10191856_1 (GHMatters) P86720.AU.4

between PD-I and a non-PD-I molecule, PD-LI and a non-PD-LI molecule, or PD-L2 and a
non-PD-L2 molecule, e.g., a natural ligand of PD-1, e.g., PD-I ligands, or a natural ligand of
PD-I ligands, e.g., PD-I or B7-1, respectively. Biologically active portions of a
polypeptide(s) of the present invention (e.g., those in Figures 2-7) include peptides
comprising amino acid sequences sufficiently identical to or derived from the amino acid
sequence of polypeptide(s) of the present invention (e.g., those in Figures 2-7), which include
fewer amino acids than the respective, full length polypeptide(s) of the present invention
(e.g., those in Figures 2-7), and exhibit at least one activity of the respective polypeptide(s) of
the present invention (e.g., those in Figures 2-7). In one embodiment, biologically active
portions comprise a domain or motif with the ability to specifically bind PD-i or a PD-Li
ligand according to the antigen, respectively, to which it was raised or designed to bind.
Biologically active portions of polypeptide(s) of the present invention (e.g., those in Figures
2-7) can be used as targets for developing agents which modulate an activity mediated by
PD-1, PD-Li, or PD-L2, e.g., immune cell activation or suppression.
[0124]          In another embodiment, polypeptide(s) of the present invention (e.g., those in
Figures 2-7) has an amino acid sequence shown in Figures 2-7. In other embodiments, the
polypeptide is substantially identical to polypeptide(s) shown in Figures 2-7, and retains the
functional activity of the respective polypeptide(s) shown in Figures 2-7, yet differs in amino
acid sequence due to mutagenesis, as described in detail in subsection I above. Accordingly,
in another embodiment, a polypeptide(s) of the present invention is a polypeptide which
comprises an amino acid sequence at least about 71%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 91%, 92%,
93%, 94%, 95%, 96% 97%, 98%, 99%, 99.5%, or 99.9% or more identical to a
polypeptide(s) shown in Figures 2-7.
[0125]          To determine the percent identity of two amino acid sequences or of two nucleic
acid sequences, the sequences are aligned for optimal comparison purposes (e.g., gaps can be
introduced in one or both of a first and a second amino acid or nucleic acid sequence for
optimal alignment and non-identical sequences can be disregarded for comparison purposes).
In one embodiment, the length of a reference sequence aligned for comparison purposes is at
least 30%, preferably at least 40%, more preferably at least 50%, even more preferably at
least 60%, and even more preferably at least 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%,
99.5%, or          9 9 . 9 % of the length of the reference sequence. The amino acid residues or
nucleotides at corresponding amino acid positions or nucleotide positions are then compared.
When a position in the first sequence is occupied by the same amino acid residue or
                                                           34
10191856_1 (GHMatters) P86720.AU.4

nucleotide as the corresponding position in the second sequence, then the molecules are
identical at that position (as used herein amino acid or nucleic acid "identity" is equivalent to
amino acid or nucleic acid "homology"). The percent identity between the two sequences is
a function of the number of identical positions shared by the sequences, taking into account
the number of gaps, and the length of each gap, which need to be introduced for optimal
alignment of the two sequences.
[0126]          The invention also provides chimeric or fusion proteins. As used herein, a
"chimeric protein" or "fusion protein" comprises a polypeptide(s) of the present invention
(e.g., those in Figures 2-7) operatively linked to a polypeptide not of the present invention. A
"polypeptide(s) of the present invention" refers to a polypeptide having an amino acid
sequence corresponding to a polypeptide shown in Figures 2-7, whereas a "polypeptide not of
the present invention " refers to a polypeptide not having an amino acid sequence
corresponding to a polypeptide which is not substantially homologous to a polypeptide
shown in Figures 2-7, e.g., a polypeptide which is different from a polypeptide shown in
Figures 2-7 and which is derived from the same or a different organism. Within the fusion
protein, the term "operatively linked" is intended to indicate that the polypeptide(s) of the
present invention and the polypeptide(s) not of the present invention are fused in-frame to
each other. The polypeptide(s) not of the present invention can be fused to the N-terminus or
C-terminus of the polypeptide(s) of the present invention and corresponds to a moiety that
alters the solubility, binding affinity, stability, or valency of the polypeptide(s) of the present
invention.
 [0127]         For example, in one embodiment, the fusion protein is a GST fusion protein with a
polypeptide(s) of the present invention. Such fusion proteins can facilitate the purification of
recombinant polypeptides of the invention. In another embodiment, the fusion protein
contains a heterologous signal sequence at its N-terminus. In certain host cells (e.g.,
mammalian host cells), expression and/or secretion of polypeptide(s) of the present invention
can be increased through use of a heterologous signal sequence.
 [0128]         A chimeric or fusion polypeptide(s) of the present invention (e.g., those in Figures
2-7) can be produced by standard recombinant DNA techniques. For example, DNA
fragments coding for the different polypeptide sequences are ligated together in-frame in
accordance with conventional techniques, for example by employing blunt-ended or stagger
ended termini for ligation, restriction enzyme digestion to provide for appropriate termini,
filling-in of cohesive ends as appropriate, alkaline phosphatase treatment to avoid undesirable
                                                    35
10191856_1 (GHMatters) P86720.AU.4

joining, and enzymatic ligation. In another embodiment, the fusion gene can be synthesized
by conventional techniques including automated DNA synthesizers. Alternatively, PCR
 amplification of gene fragments can be carried out using anchor primers which give rise to
 complementary overhangs between two consecutive gene fragments which can subsequently
be annealed and reamplified to generate a chimeric gene sequence (see, for example, Current
Protocols in Molecular Biology, Ausubel et al., eds., John Wiley & Sons: 1992). Moreover,

III.          Antibodies to PD-1, PD-LI, and/or PD-L2
 [0130]          Antibodies to PD-1, PD-Li, or PD-L2 described herein may be produced using any
methods described herein or known in the art. Monoclonal antibodies (e.g., human
 antibodies) of the invention can be produced using a variety of known techniques, such as the
 standard somatic cell hybridization technique described by Kohler and Milstein, Nature 256:
 495 (1975). Although somatic cell hybridization procedures are preferred, in principle, other
 techniques for producing monoclonal antibodies also can be employed, e.g., viral or
                                                   36

oncogenic transformation of B lymphocytes, phage display technique using libraries of
human antibody genes.
[0131]          One method for generating hybridomas which produce monoclonal antibodies of
the invention is the murine system. Hybridoma production in the mouse is well known in the
art, including immunization protocols and techniques for isolating and fusing immunized
splenocytes.
[0132]          Polyclonal antibodies can be prepared as described above by immunizing a suitable
subject with a polypeptide immunogen. The polypeptide antibody titer in the immunized
subject can be monitored over time by standard techniques, such as with an enzyme linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using immobilized polypeptide. If desired, the antibody
directed against the antigen can be isolated from the mammal (e.g., from the blood) and
further purified by well known techniques, such as protein A chromatography to obtain the
IgG fraction. At an appropriate time after immunization, e.g., when the antibody titers are
highest, antibody-producing cells can be obtained from the subject and used to prepare
monoclonal antibodies by standard techniques, such as the hybridoma technique originally
described by Kohler and Milstein (1975) Nature 256:495-497) (see also Brown et al. (1981)
J Immunol. 127:539-46; Brown et al. (1980) J Biol. Chem. 255:4980-83; Yeh et al. (1976)
Proc.Natl. Acad. Sci. 76:2927-3 1; and Yeh et al. (1982) Int. J Cancer 29:269-75), the more
recent human B cell hybridoma technique (Kozbor et al. (1983) Immunol. Today 4:72), the
EBV-hybridoma technique (Cole et al. (1985) Monoclonal Antibodies and Cancer Therapy,
Alan R. Liss, Inc., pp. 77-96) or trioma techniques. The technology for producing
monoclonal antibody hybridomas is well known (see generally Kenneth, R. H. in Monoclonal
Antibodies: A New Dimension In BiologicalAnalyses, Plenum Publishing Corp., New York,
New York (1980); Lemer, E. A. (1981) Yale J Biol. Med. 54:387-402; Gefter, M. L. et al.
(1977) Somatic Cell Genet. 3:231-36). Briefly, an immortal cell line (typically a myeloma) is
fused to lymphocytes (typically splenocytes) from a mammal immunized with an immunogen
as described above, and the culture supernatants of the resulting hybridoma cells are screened
to identify a hybridoma producing a monoclonal antibody that binds to the polypeptide
antigen, preferably specifically.
[0133]          Any of the many well known protocols used for fusing lymphocytes and
immortalized cell lines can be applied for the purpose of generating an anti-PD-1, PD-L1, or
PD-L2_monoclonal antibody (see, e.g., Galfre, G. et al. (1977) Nature 266:55052; Gefter et
al. (1977) supra; Lemer (1981) supra; Kenneth (1980) supra). Moreover, the ordinary
                                                    37
10191856_1 (GHMatters) P86720.AU.4

skilled worker will appreciate that there are many variations of such methods which also
would be useful. Typically, the immortal cell line (e.g., a myeloma cell line) is derived from
the same mammalian species as the lymphocytes. For example, murine hybridomas can be
made by fusing lymphocytes from a mouse immunized with an immunogenic preparation of
the present invention with an immortalized mouse cell line. Preferred immortal cell lines are
mouse myeloma cell lines that are sensitive to culture medium containing hypoxanthine,
aminopterin and thymidine ("HAT medium"). Any of a number of myeloma cell lines can be
used as a fusion partner according to standard techniques, e.g., the P3-NS1/1-Ag4-1, P3-x63
Ag8.653 or Sp2/O-Ag14 myeloma lines. These myeloma lines are available from the
American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), Rockville, Md. Typically, HAT-sensitive
mouse myeloma cells are fused to mouse splenocytes using polyethylene glycol ("PEG").
Hybridoma cells resulting from the fusion are then selected using HAT medium, which kills
unfused and unproductively fused myeloma cells (unfused splenocytes die after several days
because they are not transformed). Hybridoma cells producing a monoclonal antibody of the
invention are detected by screening the hybridoma culture supernatants for antibodies that
bind a given polypeptide, e.g., using a standard ELISA assay.
[0134]          As an alternative to preparing monoclonal antibody-secreting hybridomas, a
monoclonal specific for one of the above described polypeptides can be identified and
isolated by screening a recombinant combinatorial immunoglobulin library (e.g., an antibody
phage display library) with the appropriate polypeptide to thereby isolate immunoglobulin
library members that bind the polypeptide. Kits for generating and screening phage display
libraries are commercially available (e.g., the Pharmacia Recombinant Phage Antibody
System, Catalog No. 27-9400-0 1; and the Stratagene SurfZAPTM PhageDisplay Kit, Catalog
No. 240612). Additionally, examples of methods and reagents particularly amenable for use
in generating and screening an antibody display library can be found in, for example, Ladner

[0136]          In addition, humanized antibodies can be made according to standard protocols such
as those disclosed in US patent 5,565,332. In another embodiment, antibody chains or
specific binding pair members can be produced by recombination between vectors
comprising nucleic acid molecules encoding a fusion of a polypeptide chain of a specific

 [0137]         In another embodiment, human monoclonal antibodies directed against PD-1, PD
LI, or PD-L2 can be generated using transgenic or transchromosomal mice carrying parts of
the human immune system rather than the mouse system. In one embodiment, transgenic
mice, referred to herein as "HuMAb mice" which contain a human immunoglobulin gene
miniloci that encodes unrearranged human heavy ([t and f and i4ight chain immunoglobulin
sequences, together with targeted mutations that inactivate the endogenous [ and ichain loci
(Lonberg, N. et al. (1994) Nature 368(6474): 856 859). Accordingly, the mice exhibit
reduced expression of mouse IgM or cand in respon se to immunization, the introduced
human heavy and light chain transgenes undergo class switching and somatic mutation to
generate high affinity human IgGmionoclonal antib odies (Lonberg, N. et al. (1994), supra;

[0138]          In another embodiment, an antibody for use in the invention is a bispecific
antibody. A bispecific antibody has binding sites for two different antigens within a single
antibody polypeptide. Antigen binding may be simultaneous or sequential. Triomas and
hybrid hybridomas are two examples of cell lines that can secrete bispecific antibodies.
Examples of bispecific antibodies produced by a hybrid hybridoma or a trioma are disclosed
in U.S. Pat. 4,474,893. Bispecific antibodies have been constructed by chemical means
(Staerz et al. (1985) Nature 314:628, and Perez et al. (1985) Nature 316:354) and hybridoma
technology (Staerz and Bevan (1986) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 83:1453, and Staerz and
Bevan (1986) Immunol. Today 7:241). Bispecific antibodies are also described in U.S. patent
5,959,084. Fragments of bispecific antibodies are described in US patent 5,798,229.
                Bispecific agents can also be generated by making heterohybridomas by fusing
hybridomas or other cells making different antibodies, followed by identification of clones
producing and co-assembling both antibodies. They can also be generated by chemical or
genetic conjugation of complete immunoglobulin chains or portions thereof such as Fab and
Fv sequences. The antibody component can bind to PD-1, PD-Li, and/or a PD-L2
polypeptide. In one embodiment, the bispecific antibody could specifically bind to both a
PD-I ligand and a PD-I polypeptide.
[0139]          Yet another aspect of the invention pertains to anti-PD-1, PD-L1, or PD-L2
polypeptide antibodies that are obtainable by a process comprising, immunizing an animal
with an immunogenic PD-1, PD-LI, or PD-L2 polypeptide, respectively, or an immunogenic
portion thereof; and then isolating from the animal antibodies that specifically bind to the
polypeptide.
[0140]          In still another aspect of the invention, partial or known antibody sequences can be
used to generate and/or express new antibodies. Antibodies interact with target antigens
predominantly through amino acid residues that are located in the six heavy and light chain
complementarity determining regions (CDRs). For this reason, the amino acid sequences
within CDRs are more diverse between individual antibodies than sequences outside of
CDRs. Because CDR sequences are responsible for most antibody-antigen interactions, it is
possible to express recombinant antibodies that mimic the properties of specific naturally
occurring antibodies by constructing expression vectors that include CDR sequences from the
specific naturally occurring antibody grafted onto framework sequences from a different
                                                       41
10191856_1 (GHMatters) P86720.AU.4

antibody with different properties (see, e.g., Riechmann, L. et al., 1998, Nature 332:323 327;
Jones, P. et al., 1986, Nature 321:522 525; and Queen, C. et al., 1989, Proc. Natl. Acad. See.
U.S.A. 86:10029 10033). Such framework sequences can be obtained from public DNA
databases that include germline or non-germline antibody gene sequences. These germline
sequences will differ from mature antibody gene sequences because they will not include
completely assembled variable genes, which are formed by V(D)J joining during B cell
maturation. Germline gene sequences will also differ from the sequences of a high affinity
secondary repertoire antibody at individual evenly across the variable region. For example,
somatic mutations are relatively infrequent in the amino-terminal portion of framework
region. For example, somatic mutations are relatively infrequent in the amino terminal
portion of framework region 1 and in the carboxy-terminal portion of framework region 4.
Furthermore, many somatic mutations do not significantly alter the binding properties of the
antibody. For this reason, it is not necessary to obtain the entire DNA sequence of a
particular antibody in order to recreate an intact recombinant antibody having binding
properties similar to those of the original antibody (see PCT/US99/05535 filed on Mar. 12,
 1999). Partial heavy and light chain sequence spanning the CDR regions is typically
sufficient for this purpose. The partial sequence is used to determine which germline and/or
non-germline variable and joining gene segments contributed to the recombined antibody
variable genes. The germline and/or non-germline sequence is then used to fill in missing
portions of the variable regions. Heavy and light chain leader sequences are cleaved during
protein maturation and do not contribute to the properties of the final antibody. To add
missing sequences, cloned cDNA sequences can be combined with synthetic oligonucleotides
by ligation or PCR amplification. Alternatively, the entire variable region can be synthesized
as a set of short, overlapping, oligonucleotides and combined by PCR amplification to create
an entirely synthetic variable region clone. This process has certain advantages such as
elimination or inclusion or particular restriction sites, or optimization of particular codons.
The process can also be used to screen libraries of particular immunoglobulin encoding
sequences in one species (e.g., human) to design cognate immunoglobulin encoding
sequences from known antibody sequence in another species (e.g., mouse) (see, for example,
the Examples section below).
[0141]          The nucleotide sequences of heavy and light chain transcripts from a hybridoma are
used to design an overlapping set of synthetic oligonucleotides to create synthetic V
sequences with identical amino acid coding capacities as the natural sequences. The synthetic
                                                   42
10191856_1 (GHMatters) P86720.AU.4

heavy and kappa chain sequences can differ from the natural sequences in three ways: strings
of repeated nucleotide bases are interrupted to facilitate oligonucleotide synthesis and PCR
amplification; optimal translation initiation sites are incorporated according to Kozak's rules
(Kozak, 1991, J. Biol. Chem. 266LI9867019870); and, HindIl sites are engineered upstream
of the translation initiation sites.
[0142]          For both the heavy and light chain variable regions, the optimized coding, and
corresponding non-coding, strand sequences are broken down into 30-50 nucleotide
approximately the midpoint of the corresponding non-coding oligonucleotide. Thus, for each
chain, the oligonucleotides can be assembled into overlapping double stranded sets that span
segments of 150-400 nucleotides. The pools are then used as templates to produce PCR
amplification products of 150-400 nucleotides. Typically, a single variable region
oligonucleotide set will be broken down into two pools which are separately amplified to
generate two overlapping PCR products. These overlapping products are then combined by
PCR amplification to form the complete variable region. It may also be desirable to include
an overlapping fragment of the heavy or light chain constant region in the PCR amplification
to generate fragments that can easily be cloned into the expression vector constructs.
[0143]          The reconstructed heavy and light chain variable regions are then combined with
cloned promoter, leader sequence, translation initiation, leader sequence, constant region, 3'
untranslated, polyadenylation, and transcription termination, sequences to form expression
vector constructs. The heavy and light chain expression constructs can be combined into a
single vector, co-transfected, serially transfected, or separately transfected into host cells
which are then fused to form a host cell expressing both chains.
[0144]          Plasmids for this use are known in the art and include the plasmids provided in the
Examples section below. Fully human and chimeric antibodies of the present invention also
include IgG2, IgG3, IgE, IgA, IgM, and IgD antibodies. Similar plasmids can be constructed
for expression of other heavy chain isotypes, or for expression of antibodies comprising
lambda light chains.
[0145]          Thus, in another aspect of the invention, the structural features of known, non
human or human antibodies (e.g., a mouse anti-human anti-PD-1, PD-L1, or PD-L2 antibody,
such as antibodies EH12.2H7, 29E.2A3, and 24F. IOC12 respectively) are used to create
structurally related human anti-human PD-1, PD-L1, or PD-L2 antibodies that retain at least
one functional property of the antibodies of the invention, such as binding to PD-1, PD-Li, or
PD-L2. Another functional property includes inhibiting binding of EH12.2H7 to PD-1,
                                                     43

29E.2A3 to PD-Li, or 24F.10CI2 to PD-L2 in a competition ELISA assay. In some
embodiments, the structurally related anti-human PD-1, PD-Li, or PD-L2 antibodies have a
lower binding affinity to the antigen as compared to antibody EH12.2H7, 29E.2A3, or
24F.IOC12 as measured by the IC50 value as described in Example 2 (e.g., the affinity of the
murine reference antibody is no greater than any of 3.0, 2.0, 1.9, 1.8, 1.7, 1.6, 1.5, 1.4, 1.3,
 1.2 or 1. 1 fold of the structurally related antibody). In some embodiments, the structurally
related anti-human PD-1, PD-Li, or PD-L2 antibodies have a higher affinity to the antigen as
compared to antibody EH12.2H7, 29E.2A3, or 24F.10Ci2 as measured by the IC50 value as
described in Example 2 (such as the affinity of the structurally related antibody is at least 1.1,
 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.7, 1.8, 1.9, or 2.0 fold of the reference antibody). In addition, one or
more CDR or variable regions of the present invention (e.g., Figures 2-7) can be combined
recombinantly with known human framework regions and CDRs to create additional,
recombinantly-engineered, human anti-PD-1, PD-L1, or PD-L2 antibodies of the invention.
[0146]          Since it is well known in the art that antibody heavy and light chain CDR3 domains
play a particularly important role in the binding specificity/affinity of an antibody for an
antigen, the recombinant antibodies of the invention prepared as set forth above preferably
comprise the heavy and light chain CDR3s of variable regions of the present invention (e.g.,
Figures 2-7). The antibodies further can comprise the CDR2s of variable regions of the
present invention (e.g., Figures 2-7). The antibodies further can comprise the CDRis of
variable regions of the present invention (e.g., Figures 2-7). The antibodies can further
comprise any combinations of the CDRs.
[0147]          The CDRi, 2, and/or 3 regions of the engineered antibodies described above can
comprise the exact amino acid sequence(s) as those of variable regions of the present
invention (e.g., Figures 2-7) disclosed herein. However, the ordinarily skilled artisan will
appreciate that some deviation from the exact CDR sequences may be possible while still
retaining the ability of the antibody to bind PD-1, PD-Li, or PD-L2 effectively (e.g.,
conservative sequence modifications). Accordingly, in another embodiment, the engineered
antibody may be composed of one or more CDRs that are, for example, 50%, 60%, 70%,
80%, 85%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, or 99.5% identical to
one or more CDRs of the present invention (e.g., Figures 2-7).
[0148]          In addition to simply binding PD-1, PD-Li, or PD-L2, engineered antibodies such
as those described above may be selected for their retention of other functional properties of
antibodies of the invention, such as:

(3) binding to human PD-I and inhibiting the ability of the bound PD-I to bind to PD-I

ligands (e.g., PD-1).

[0150]          Antibodies' activity in inhibiting binding of PD-1, PD-Li, or PD-L2 to its ligand(s)
can be determined by testing the ability of the antibody from blocking the binding between
PD-1, PD-LI, or PD-L2 and its ligand. A competition ELISA assay in the presence of a
labeled ligand and the antibody may be used. For example, to determine if an anti-PD-LI
antibody could block the interaction between PD-i and PD-Li, a competitive binding
experiment is performed. Cells expressing PD-Li is preincubated with the anti-PD-Li
antibody followed by the addition of biotinylated PD-i-Ig fusion protein. If the anti-PD-Li
antibody blocks the binding of PD-i -Ig in a dose-dependent manner and with high avidity,
the antib-PD-L I antibody is considered as being effective in inhibiting the interaction
between PD-i and PD-Li. Similar tests may be carried out to test antibodies that are
effective in inhibiting the interaction of PD-i and PD-L2.
IV.          Recombinant Expression Vectors and Host Cells
[0151]          Another aspect of the invention pertains to vectors, preferably expression vectors,
containing one, two, or more nucleic acid molecules encoding one or more polypeptides of
the present invention (e.g., Figures 2-7) (or a portion thereof). As used herein, the term
"vector" refers to a nucleic acid molecule capable of transporting another nucleic acid to
which it has been linked. One type of vector is a "plasmid", which refers to a circular double
stranded DNA loop into which additional DNA segments can be ligated. Another type of
vector is a viral vector, wherein additional DNA segments can be ligated into the viral
genome. Certain vectors are capable of autonomous replication in a host cell into which they
are introduced (e.g., bacterial vectors having a bacterial origin of replication and episomal
                                                      46
10191856_1 (GHMatters) P86720.AU.4

mammalian vectors). Other vectors (e.g., non-episomal mammalian vectors) are integrated
into the genome of a host cell upon introduction into the host cell, and thereby are replicated
along with the host genome. Moreover, certain vectors are capable of directing the
expression of genes to which they are operatively linked. Such vectors are referred to herein
as "expression vectors". In general, expression vectors of utility in recombinant DNA
techniques are often in the form of plasmids. In the present specification, "plasmid" and
"vector" can be used interchangeably as the plasmid is the most commonly used form of
vector. However, the invention is intended to include such other forms of expression vectors,
such as viral vectors (e.g., replication defective retroviruses, adenoviruses and adeno
associated viruses), which serve equivalent functions.
[0152]          The recombinant expression vectors of the invention comprise a nucleic acid of the
invention in a form suitable for expression of the nucleic acid in a host cell, which means that
the recombinant expression vectors include one or more regulatory sequences, selected on the
basis of the host cells to be used for expression, which is operatively linked to the nucleic
acid sequence to be expressed. Within a recombinant expression vector, "operably linked" is
intended to mean that the nucleotide sequence of interest is linked to the regulatory
sequence(s) in a manner which allows for expression of the nucleotide sequence (e.g., in an
in vitro transcription/translation system or in a host cell when the vector is introduced into the
host cell). The term "regulatory sequence" is intended to include promoters, enhancers and
other expression control elements (e.g., polyadenylation signals). Such regulatory sequences
are described, for example, in Goeddel (1990) Methods Enzymol. 185:3-7. Regulatory
sequences include those which direct constitutive expression of a nucleotide sequence in
many types of host cells and those which direct expression of the nucleotide sequence only in
certain host cells (e.g., tissue-specific regulatory sequences). It will be appreciated by those
skilled in the art that the design of the expression vector can depend on such factors as the
choice of the host cell to be transformed, the level of expression of protein desired, and the
like. The expression vectors of the invention can be introduced into host cells to thereby
produce proteins or peptides, including fusion proteins or peptides, encoded by nucleic acids
as described herein.
[0153]          The recombinant expression vectors of the invention can be designed for expression
of polypeptides of the present invention (e.g., Figures 2-7 ) in prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells.
For example, the polypeptides can be expressed in bacterial cells such as E. coli, insect cells
(using baculovirus expression vectors), yeast cells, or mammalian cells. Suitable host cells
                                                  47
10191856_1 (GHMatters) P86720.AU.4

are discussed further in Goeddel (1990) supra. Alternatively, the recombinant expression
vector can be transcribed and translated in vitro, for example using T7 promoter regulatory
sequences and T7 polymerase.
[0154]          Expression of polypeptides in prokaryotes is most often carried out in E. coli with
vectors containing constitutive or inducible promoters directing the expression of either
fusion or non-fusion proteins. Fusion vectors add a number of amino acids to a polypeptide
encoded therein, usually to the amino terminus of the recombinant polypeptide. Such fusion
vectors typically serve three purposes: 1) to increase expression of recombinant polypeptide;
2) to increase the solubility of the recombinant polypeptide; and 3) to aid in the purification
of the recombinant polypeptide by acting as a ligand in affinity purification. Often, in fusion
expression vectors, a proteolytic cleavage site is introduced at the junction of the fusion
moiety and the recombinant polypeptide to enable separation of the recombinant polypeptide
from the fusion moiety subsequent to purification of the fusion protein. Such enzymes, and
their cognate recognition sequences, include Factor Xa, thrombin and enterokinase. Typical
fusion expression vectors include pGEX (Pharmacia Biotech Inc; Smith, D. B. and Johnson,
K. S. (1988) Gene 67:31-40), pMAL (New England Biolabs, Beverly, Mass.) and pRIT5
(Pharmacia, Piscataway, NJ) which fuse glutathione S-transferase (GST), maltose E binding
protein, or protein A, respectively, to the target recombinant polypeptide.
[0155]          Examples of suitable inducible non-fusion E. coli expression vectors include pTrc
(Amann et al. (1988) Gene 69:301-315) and pET 1 Id (Studier et al. (1990) Methods
Enzymol. 185:60-89). Target gene expression from the pTrc vector relies on host RNA
polymerase transcription from a hybrid trp-lac fusion promoter. Target gene expression from
the pET 11 d vector relies on transcription from a T7 gn10-lac fusion promoter mediated by a
coexpressed viral RNA polymerase (T7 gnl). This viral polymerase is supplied by host
strains BL21(DE3) or HMS174(DE3) from a resident prophage harboring a T7 gn1 gene
under the transcriptional control of the lacUV 5 promoter.
[0156]          One strategy to maximize recombinant polypeptide expression in E. coli is to
express the polypeptide in host bacteria with impaired capacity to proteolytically cleave the
recombinant polypeptide (Gottesman, S. (1990) Methods Enzymol. 185:119-128). Another
strategy is to alter the nucleic acid sequence of the nucleic acid to be inserted into an
expression vector so that the individual codons for each amino acid are those preferentially
utilized in E. coli (Wada et al. (1992) Nucleic Acids Res. 20:2111-2118). Such alteration of
                                                    48
10191856_1 (GHMatters) P86720.AU.4

nucleic acid sequences of the invention can be carried out by standard DNA synthesis
techniques.
[0157]          In another embodiment, the expression vector is a yeast expression vector.
Examples of vectors for expression in yeast S. cerevisiae include pYepSec1 (Baldari et al.
(1987) EMBO J. 6:229-234), pMFa (Kurjan and Herskowitz (1982) Cell 30:933-943),
pJRY88 (Schultz et al. (1987) Gene 54:113-123), pYES2 (Invitrogen Corporation, San
Diego, Calif.), and picZ (Invitrogen Corp, San Diego, Calif.).
[0158]          Alternatively, polypeptides of the present invention (e.g., Figures 2-7) can be
expressed in insect cells using baculovirus expression vectors. Baculovirus vectors available
for expression of polypeptides in cultured insect cells (e.g., Sf 9 cells) include the pAc 'series
(Smith et al. (1983) Mol. Cell Biol. 3:2156-2165) and the pVL series (Lucklow and Summers
(1989) Virology 170:31-39).
[0159]          In yet another embodiment, a nucleic acid of the present invention (e.g., Figures 2
7) is expressed in mammalian cells using a mammalian expression vector. Examples of
mammalian expression vectors include pCDM8 (Seed, B. (1987) Nature 329:840) and
pMT2PC (Kaufman et al. (1987) EMBO J. 6:187-195). When used in mammalian cells, the
expression vector's control functions are often provided by viral regulatory elements. For
example, commonly used promoters are derived from polyoma, Adenovirus 2,
cytomegalovirus and Simian Virus 40. For other suitable expression systems for both
prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells see chapters 16 and 17 of Sambrook, J. et al., Molecular
Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor
Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., 1989.
[0160]          In another embodiment, the recombinant mammalian expression vector is capable
of directing expression of the nucleic acid preferentially in a particular cell type (e.g., tissue
specific regulatory elements are used to express the nucleic acid). Tissue-specific regulatory
elements are known in the art. Non-limiting examples of suitable tissue-specific promoters
include the albumin promoter (liver-specific; Pinkert et al. (1987) Genes Dev. 1:268-277),
lymphoid-specific promoters (Calame and Eaton (1988) Adv. Immunol. 43:235-275),
particular promoters of T cell receptors (Winoto and Baltimore (1989) EMBO J. 8:729-733)
and immunoglobulins (Banerji et al. (1983) Cell 33:729-740; Queen and Baltimore (1983)
Cell 33:741-748), neuron-specific promoters (e.g., the neurofilament promoter; Byrne and
Ruddle (1989) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86:5473-5477), pancreas-specific promoters
(Edlund et al. (1985) Science 230:912-916), and mammary gland-specific promoters (e.g.,
                                                     49
10191856_1 (GHMatters) P86720.AU.4

milk whey promoter; U.S. Pat. No. 4,873,316 and European Application Publication No.
264,166). Developmentally-regulated promoters are also encompassed, for example by the
murine hox promoters (Kessel and Gruss (1990) Science 249:374-379) and the .alpha.
fetoprotein promoter (Campes and Tilghman (1989) Genes Dev. 3:537-546).
[0161]          Another aspect of the invention pertains to host cells into which a nucleic acid
molecule of the present invention (e.g., Figures 2-7) is introduced within a recombinant
expression vector or a nucleic acid molecule containing sequences which allow it to
homologously recombine into a specific site of the host cell's genome. The terms "host cell"
and "recombinant host cell" are used interchangeably herein. It is understood that such terms
refer not only to the particular subject cell but to the progeny or potential progeny of such a
cell. Because certain modifications may occur in succeeding generations due to either
mutation or environmental influences, such progeny may not, in fact, be identical to the
parent cell, but are still included within the scope of the term as used herein.
[0162]          A host cell can be any prokaryotic or eukaryotic cell. For example, a polypeptide of
the present invention (e.g., Figures 2-7) can be expressed in bacterial cells such as E. coli,
insect cells, yeast or mammalian cells (such as Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO) or COS
cells). Other suitable host cells are known to those skilled in the art.
[0163]          Vector DNA can be introduced into prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells via conventional
transformation or transfection techniques. As used herein, the terms "transformation" and
"transfection" are intended to refer to a variety of art-recognized techniques for introducing
foreign nucleic acid (e.g., DNA) into a host cell, including calcium phosphate or calcium
chloride co-precipitation, DEAE-dextran-mediated transfection, lipofection, or
electroporation. Suitable methods for transforming or transfecting host cells can be found in
Sambrook et al. (Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd, ed., Cold Spring Harbor
Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., 1989), and
other laboratory manuals.
[0164]          For stable transfection of mammalian cells, it is known that, depending upon the
expression vector and transfection technique used, only a small fraction of cells may integrate
the foreign DNA into their genome. In order to identify and select these integrants, a gene
that encodes a selectable marker (e.g., resistance to antibiotics) is generally introduced into
the host cells along with the gene of interest. Preferred selectable markers include those
which confer resistance to drugs, such as G418, hygromycin and methotrexate. Nucleic acid
encoding a selectable marker can be introduced into a host cell on the same vector as that
                                                    50
10191856_1 (GHMatters) P86720.AU.4

encoding a PD-L2 polypeptide or can be introduced on a separate vector. Cells stably
transfected with the introduced nucleic acid can be identified by drug selection (e.g., cells
that have incorporated the selectable marker gene will survive, while the other cells die).
[0165]          A host cell of the invention, such as a prokaryotic or eukaryotic host cell in culture,
can be used to produce (i.e., express) a polypeptide of the present invention (e.g., Figures 2
7). Accordingly, the invention further provides methods for producing a polypeptide of the
present invention (e.g., Figures 2-7) using the host cells of the present invention. In one
embodiment, the method comprises culturing the host cell of the invention (into which a
recombinant expression vector encoding a polypeptide of the present invention (e.g., Figures
2-7) has been introduced) in a suitable medium such that a polypeptide of the present
invention (e.g., Figures 2-7) is produced. In another embodiment, the method further
comprises isolating a polypeptide of the present invention (e.g., Figures 2-7) from the
medium or the host cell.
[0166]          The host cells of the invention can also be used to produce non-human transgenic
animals, as described below.
V.           Production of Transgenic and Transchromosomal Nonhuman Animals Which
Generate Composite, Human PD-1, PD-Li, or PD-L2 Antibodies
[0167]          In yet another aspect, the invention provides transgenic and transchromosomal non
human animals, such as transgenic or transchromosomal mice, which are capable of
expressing human monoclonal antibodies that specifically bind to PD-1, PD-Li, or PD-L2.
In a particular embodiment, the invention provides a transgenic or transchromosomal mouse
having a genome comprising a human heavy chain transgene, such that the mouse produces
human anti- PD-1, PD-L1, or PD-L2 antibodies when immunized with PD-1, PD-L1, or PD
L2 antigen and/or cells expressing PD-1, PD-Li, or PD-L2. The human heavy chain
transgene can be integrated into the chromosomal DNA of the mouse, as is the case for
transgenic, e.g., HuMAb, mice accordingly to methods well known in the art. Alternatively,
the human heavy chain transgene can be maintained extrachromosomally, as is the case for
transchromosomal (e.g., KM) mice as described in WO 02/43478. Such transgenic and
transchromosomal mice are capable of producing multiple isotypes of human monoclonal
antibodies to PD-1, PD-Li, or PD-L2 (e.g., IgG, IgA and/or IgE) by undergoing V-D-J
                                                      51
10191856_1 (GHMatters) P86720.AU.4

recombination and isotype switching. Isotype switching may occur by, e.g., classical or non
classical isotype switching.
[0168]          The design of a transgenic or transchromsomal non-human animal that responds to
foreign antigen stimulation with a heterologous antibody repertoire, requires that the
heterologous immunoglobulin transgenes contained within the transgenic animal function
correctly throughout the pathway of B-cell development. This includes, for example, isotype
switching of the heterologous heavy chain transgene. Accordingly, transgenes are
constructed so as to produce isotype switching and one or more of the following of
antibodies: (1) high level and cell-type specific expression, (2) functional gene
rearrangement, (3) activation of and response to allelic exclusion, (4) expression of a
sufficient primary repertoire, (5) signal transduction, (6) somatic hypermutation, and (7)
domination of the transgene antibody locus during the immune response.
[0169]          Not all of the foregoing criteria need be met. For example, in those embodiments
wherein the endogenous immunoglobulin loci of the transgenic animal are functionally
disrupted, the transgene need not activate allelic exclusion. Further, in those embodiments
wherein the transgene comprises a functionally rearranged heavy and/or light chain
immunoglobulin gene, the second criteria of functional gene rearrangement is unnecessary, at
least for that transgene which is already rearranged. For background on molecular
immunology, see, Fundamental Immunology, 2nd edition (1989), Paul William E., ed. Raven
Press, N.Y.
[0170]          In certain embodiments, the transgenic or transchromosomal non-human animals
used to generate the human monoclonal antibodies of the invention contain rearranged,
unrearranged or a combination of rearranged and unrearranged heterologous immunoglobulin
heavy and light chain transgenes in the germline of the transgenic animal. Each of the heavy
chain transgenes comprises at least one CH gene. In addition, the heavy chain transgene may
contain functional isotype switch sequences, which are capable of supporting isotype
switching of a heterologous transgene encoding multiple CH genes in the B-cells of the
transgenic animal. Such switch sequences may be those which occur naturally in the
germline immunoglobulin locus from the species that serves as the source of the transgene
CH genes, or such switch sequences may be derived from those which occur in the species
that is to receive the transgene construct (the transgenic animal). For example, a human
transgene construct that is used to produce a transgenic mouse may produce a higher
frequency of isotype switching events if it incorporates switch sequences similar to those that
                                                      52
10191856_1 (GHMatters) P86720.AU.4

occur naturally in the mouse heavy chain locus, as presumably the mouse switch sequences
are optimized to function with the mouse switch recombinase enzyme system, whereas the
human switch sequences are not. Switch sequences may be isolated and cloned by
conventional cloning methods, or may be synthesized de novo from overlapping synthetic
oligonucleotides designed on the basis of published sequence information relating to
immunoglobulin switch region sequences (Mills et al., Nucl. Acids Res. 15:7305 7316
(1991); Sideras et al., Intl. Immunol. 1:631 642 (1989)). For each of the foregoing transgenic
animals, functionally rearranged heterologous heavy and light chain immunoglobulin
transgenes are found in a significant fraction of the B-cells of the transgenic animal (at least
 10 percent).
[0171]          The transgenes used to generate the transgenic animals of the invention include a
heavy chain transgene comprising DNA encoding at least one variable gene segment, one
diversity gene segment, one joining gene segment and at least one constant region gene
segment. The immunoglobulin light chain transgene comprises DNA encoding at least one
variable gene segment, one joining gene segment and at least one constant region gene
segment. The gene segments encoding the light and heavy chain gene segments are
heterologous to the transgenic non-human animal in that they are derived from, or correspond
to, DNA encoding immunoglobulin heavy and light chain gene segments from a species not
consisting of the transgenic non-human animal. In one aspect of the invention, the transgene
is constructed such that the individual gene segments are unrearranged, i.e., not rearranged so
as to encode a functional immunoglobulin light or heavy chain. Such unrearranged
transgenes support recombination of the V, D, and J gene segments (functional
rearrangement) and preferably support incorporation of all or a portion of a D region gene
segment in the resultant rearranged immunoglobulin heavy chain within the transgenic non
human animal when exposed to the PD-1, PD-L1, or PD-L2 antigen.
[0172]          In an alternate embodiment, the transgenes comprise an unrearranged "mini-locus".
Such transgenes typically comprise a substantial portion of the C, D, and J segments as well
as a subset of the V gene segments. In such transgene constructs, the various regulatory
sequences, e.g., promoters, enhancers, class switch regions, splice-donor and splice-acceptor
sequences for RNA processing, recombination signals and the like, comprise corresponding
sequences derived from the heterologous DNA. Such regulatory sequences may be
incorporated into the transgene from the same or a related species of the non-human animal
used in the invention. For example, human immunoglobulin gene segments may be
                                                    53
10191856_1 (GHMatters) P86720.AU.4

combined in a transgene with a rodent immunoglobulin enhancer sequence for use in a
transgenic mouse. Alternatively, synthetic regulatory sequences may be incorporated into the
transgene, wherein such synthetic regulatory sequences are not homologous to a functional
DNA sequence that is known to occur naturally in the genomes of mammals. Synthetic
regulatory sequences are designed according to consensus rules, such as, for example, those
specifying the permissible sequences of a splice-acceptor site or a promoter/enhancer motif.
For example, a minilocus comprises a portion of the genomic immunoglobulin locus having
at least one internal (i.e., not at a terminus of the portion) deletion of a non-essential DNA
portion (e.g., intervening sequence; intron or portion thereof) as compared to the naturally
occurring germline Ig locus.
[0173]          Transgenic and transchromsomal mice employed in the present invention can
exhibit immunoglobulin production with a significant repertoire, ideally substantially similar
to that of a native mouse. Thus, for example, in embodiments where the endogenous Ig
genes have been inactivated, the total immunoglobulin levels can range from about 0.1 to 10
mg/ml of serum, or from about 0.5 to 5 mg/ml, or at least about 1.0 mg/ml. When a
transgene capable of effecting a switch to IgG from IgM has been introduced into the
transgenic mouse, the adult mouse ratio of serum IgG to IgM can be about 10:1. The IgG to
IgM ratio will be much lower in the immature mouse. In general, greater than about 10%,
preferably 40 to 80% of the spleen and lymph node B cells express exclusively human IgG
protein.
[0174]          The repertoire will ideally approximate that shown in a native mouse, usually at
least about 10% as high, or 25 to 50% or more. Generally, at least about a thousand different
immunoglobulins (ideally IgG), e.g., preferably 104 to 106 or more, will be produced,
depending primarily on the number of different V, J and D regions introduced into the mouse
genome. These immunoglobulins will typically recognize about one-half or more of highly
antigenic proteins, e.g., staphylococcus protein A. Typically, the immunoglobulins will
exhibit an affinity (KD) for preselected antigens of below 10-7 M, such as of below 10-8 M, 10
9 M or 10 mM or even lower.
[0175]          In some embodiments, it may be preferable to generate mice with predetermined
repertoires to limit the selection of V genes represented in the antibody response to a
predetermined antigen type. A heavy chain transgene having a predetermined repertoire may
comprise, for example, human VH genes which are preferentially used in antibody responses
to the predetermined antigen type in humans. Alternatively, some VH genes may be excluded
                                                    54
10191856_1 (GHMatters) P86720.AU.4

from a defined repertoire for various reasons (e.g., have a low likelihood of encoding high
affinity V regions for the predetermined antigen; have a low propensity to undergo somatic
mutation and affinity sharpening; or are immunogenic to certain humans). Thus, prior to
rearrangement of a transgene containing various heavy or light chain gene segments, such
gene segments may be readily identified, e.g. by hybridization or DNA sequencing, as being
from a species of organism other than the transgenic animal.
[0176]          Transgenic and transchromosomal mice as described above can be immunized with,
for example, a purified or enriched preparation of PD-1, PD-Li, or PD-L2 antigen and/or
cells expressing PD-1, PD-Li, or PD-L2. Alternatively, the transgenic mice can be
immunized with DNA encoding human PD-1, PD-Li, or PD-L2. The mice will then produce
B cells which undergo class-switching via intratransgene switch recombination (cis
switching) and express immunoglobulins reactive with PD-1, PD-Li, or PD-L2. The
immunoglobulins can be human antibodies (also referred to as "human sequence
antibodies"), wherein the heavy and light chain polypeptides are encoded by human
transgene sequences, which may include sequences derived by somatic mutation and V
region recombinatorial joints, as well as germline-encoded sequences; these human
antibodies can be referred to as being substantially identical to a polypeptide sequence
encoded by a human VL or VH gene segment and a human JL or DH and           JH segment, even
though other non-germline sequences may be present as a result of somatic mutation and
differential V-J and V-D-J recombination joints. The variable regions of each antibody chain
are typically at least 80 percent encoded by human germline V, J, and, in the case of heavy
chains, D, gene segments; frequently at least 85 percent of the variable regions are encoded
by human germline sequences present on the transgene; often 90 or 95 percent or more of the
variable region sequences are encoded by human germline sequences present on the
transgene. However, since non-germline sequences are introduced by somatic mutation and
VJ and VDJ joining, the human sequence antibodies will frequently have some variable
region sequences (and less frequently constant region sequences) which are not encoded by
human V, D, or J gene segments as found in the human transgene(s) in the germline of the
mice. Typically, such non-germline sequences (or individual nucleotide positions) will
cluster in or near CDRs, or in regions where somatic mutations are known to cluster.
[0177]          Human antibodies which bind to the predetermined antigen can result from isotype
switching, such that human antibodies comprising a human sequence Thain (such as f, y
2a, 72B, or y3) and a human sequence light chain       (such as kappa) are produced. Such
                                                  55
10191856_1 (GHMatters) P86720.AU.4

isotype-switched human antibodies often contain one or more somatic mutation(s), typically
in the variable region and often in or within about 10 residues of a CDR) as a result of
affinity maturation and selection of B cells by antigen, particularly subsequent to secondary
(or subsequent) antigen challenge. These high affinity human antibodies may have binding
affinities (KD) of below 10-7 M, such as of below 10-8 M, 10 m,           10 M, 10   M or even
lower.
[0178]          Another aspect of the invention includes B cells derived from transgenic or
transchromosomal mice as described herein. The B cells can be used to generate hybridomas
expressing human monoclonal antibodies which bind with high affinity (e.g., lower than 10-7
M) to human PD-1, PD-Li, or PD-L2.
 [0179]         The development of high affinity human monoclonal antibodies against PD-1, PD
LI, or PD-L2 can be facilitated by a method for expanding the repertoire of human variable
region gene segments in a transgenic mouse having a genome comprising an integrated
human immunoglobulin transgene, said method comprising introducing into the genome a V
gene transgene comprising V region gene segments which are not present in said integrated
human immunoglobulin transgene. Often, the V region transgene is a yeast artificial
chromosome comprising a portion of a human VH            or VL (VK)  gene segment array, as may
naturally occur in a human genome or as may be spliced together separately by recombinant
methods, which may include out-of-order or omitted V gene segments. Often at least five or
more functional V gene segments are contained on the YAC. In this variation, it is possible
to make a transgenic mouse produced by the V repertoire expansion method, wherein the
mouse expresses an immunoglobulin chain comprising a variable region sequence encoded
by a V region gene segment present on the V region transgene and a C region encoded on the
human Ig transgene. By means of the V repertoire expansion method, transgenic mice
having at least 5 distinct V genes can be generated; as can mice containing at least about 24
V genes or more. Some V gene segments may be non-functional (e.g., pseudogenes and the
like); these segments may be retained or may be selectively deleted by recombinant methods
available to the skilled artisan, if desired.
 [0180]         Once the mouse germline has been engineered to contain a functional YAC having
an expanded V segment repertoire, substantially not present in the human Ig transgene
containing the J and C gene segments, the trait can be propagated and bred into other genetic
backgrounds, including backgrounds where the functional YAC having an expanded V
segment repertoire is bred into a mouse germline having a different human Ig transgene.
                                                    56
10191856_1 (GHMatters) P86720.AU.4

Multiple functional YACs having an expanded V segment repertoire may be bred into a
germline to work with a human Ig transgene (or multiple human Ig transgenes). Although
referred to herein as YAC transgenes, such transgenes when integrated into the genome may
substantially lack yeast sequences, such as sequences required for autonomous replication in
yeast; such sequences may optionally be removed by genetic engineering (e.g., restriction
digestion and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis or other suitable method) after replication in
yeast is no longer necessary (i.e., prior to introduction into a mouse ES cell or mouse
prozygote). Methods of propagating the trait of human sequence immunoglobulin
expression, include breeding a transgenic mouse having the human Ig transgene(s), and
optionally also having a functional YAC having an expanded V segment repertoire. Both VH
and VL gene segments may be present on the YAC. The transgenic mouse may be bred into
any background desired by the practitioner, including backgrounds harboring other human
transgenes, including human Ig transgenes and/or transgenes encoding other human
lymphocyte proteins. The invention also provides a high affinity human sequence
immunoglobulin produced by a transgenic mouse having an expanded V region repertoire
YAC transgene. Although the foregoing describes a preferred embodiment of the transgenic
animal of the invention, other embodiments are contemplated which have been classified in
four categories:
(1) Transgenic animals containing an unrearranged heavy and rearranged light
immunoglobulin transgene;
(2) Transgenic animals containing an unrearranged heavy and unrearranged light
immunoglobulin transgene;
(3) Transgenic animal containing rearranged heavy and an unrearranged light
immunoglobulin transgene; and
(4) Transgenic animals containing rearranged heavy and rearranged light immunoglobulin
transgenes.
VI.          Antibody Coniugates/Immunotoxins
[0181]          In another aspect, the present invention features human PD-1, PD-Li, or PD-L2
antibodies conjugated to a therapeutic moiety, such as a cytotoxin, a drug (e.g., an
immunosuppressant) or a radioisotope. When conjugated to a cytotoxin, these antibody
                                                      57
10191856_1 (GHMatters) P86720.AU.4

conjugates are referred to as "immunotoxins." A cytotoxin or cytotoxic agent includes any
agent that is detrimental to (e.g., kills) cells. Examples include taxol, cytochalasin B,
gramicidin D, ethidium bromide, emetine, mitomycin, etoposide, tenoposide, vincristine,
vinblastine, colchicin, doxorubicin, daunorubicin, dihydroxy anthracin dione, mitoxantrone,
mithramycin, actinomycin D, 1-dehydrotestosterone, glucocorticoids, procaine, tetracaine,
lidocaine, propranolol, and puromycin and analogs or homologs thereof. Therapeutic agents
include, but are not limited to, antimetabolites (e.g., methotrexate, 6-mercaptopurine, 6
thioguanine, cytarabine, 5-fluorouracil decarbazine), alkylating agents (e.g.,
mechlorethamine, thioepa chlorambucil, melphalan, carmustine (BSNU) and lomustine
(CCNU), cyclothosphamide, busulfan, dibromomannitol, streptozotocin, mitomycin C, and
cis-dichlorodiamine platinum (II) (DDP) cisplatin), anthracyclines (e.g., daunorubicin
(formerly daunomycin) and doxorubicin), antibiotics (e.g., dactinomycin (formerly
actinomycin), bleomycin, mithramycin, and anthramycin (AMC)), and anti-mitotic agents
(e.g., vincristine and vinblastine). An antibody of the present invention can be conjugated to
a radioisotope, e.g., radioactive iodine, to generate cytotoxic radiopharmaceuticals for
treating a related disorder, such as a cancer.
[0182]          Conjugated human PD-1, PD-L1, or PD-L2 antibodies can be used diagnostically or
prognostically to monitor polypeptide levels in tissue as part of a clinical testing procedure,
e.g., to, for example, determine the efficacy of a given treatment regimen. Detection can be
facilitated by coupling (i e., physically linking) the antibody to a detectable substance.
Examples of detectable substances include various enzymes, prosthetic groups, fluorescent
materials, luminescent materials, bioluminescent materials, and radioactive materials.
Examples of suitable enzymes include horseradish peroxidase, alkaline phosphatase, P
galactosidase, or acetylcholinesterase; examples of suitable prosthetic group complexes
include streptavidin/biotin and avidin/biotin; examples of suitable fluorescent materials
include umbelliferone, fluorescein, fluorescein isothiocyanate, rhodamine,
dichlorotriazinylamine fluorescein, dansyl chloride or phycoerythrin; an example of a
luminescent material includes luminol; examples of bioluminescent materials include
luciferase, luciferin, and aequorin, and examples of suitable radioactive material include     1251,
131I, . 3 5S or 3 H.
[0183]          The antibody conjugates of the invention can be used to modify a given biological
response. The therapeutic moiety is not to be construed as limited to classical chemical
therapeutic agents. For example, the drug moiety may be a protein or polypeptide possessing
                                                   58
10191856_1 (GHMatters) P86720.AU.4

a desired biological activity. Such proteins may include, for example, an enzymatically
active toxin, or active fragment thereof, such as abrin, ricin A, pseudomonas exotoxin, or
diphtheria toxin; a protein such as tumor necrosis factor or interferon-.gamma.; or, biological
response modifiers such as, for example, lymphokines, interleukin-1 ("IL-i"), interleukin-2
("IL-2"), interleukin-6 ("IL-6"), granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor ("GM
CSF"), granulocyte colony stimulating factor ("G-CSF"), or other cytokines or growth
factors.
[0184]          Techniques for conjugating such therapeutic moiety to antibodies are well known,
see, e.g., Arnon et al., "Monoclonal Antibodies For Immunotargeting Of Drugs In Cancer
Therapy", in Monoclonal Antibodies And Cancer Therapy, Reisfeld et al. (eds.), pp. 243 56
(Alan R. Liss, Inc. 1985); Hellstrom et al., "Antibodies For Drug Delivery", in Controlled
Drug Delivery (2nd Ed.), Robinson et al. (eds.), pp. 623 53 (Marcel Dekker, Inc. 1987);

Radiolabeled Antibody In Cancer Therapy", in Monoclonal Antibodies For Cancer Detection
And Therapy, Baldwin et al. (eds.), pp. 303 16 (Academic Press 1985), and Thorpe et al.,

VII.         Pharmaceutical Compositions
[0185]          In another aspect, the present invention provides a composition, e.g., a
pharmaceutical composition, containing one or a combination of the monoclonal antibodies,
or antigen-binding portion(s) thereof (such as antigen-binding fragments), of the present
invention, formulated together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. In one
embodiment, the compositions include a combination of multiple (e.g., two or more) isolated
human antibodies of the invention. Preferably, each of the antibodies of the composition
binds to a distinct, pre-selected epitope of PD-1, PD-Li, and/or PD-L2.
[0186]          Pharmaceutical compositions of the invention also can be administered in
combination therapy, i.e., combined with other agents. For example, the combination therapy
can include a composition of the present invention with at least one or more additional
therapeutic agents, such as anti-inflammatory agents, DMARDs (disease-modifying anti
                                                      59
10191856_1 (GHMatters) P86720.AU.4

rheumatic drugs), immunosuppressive agents, chemotherapeutics, and psoriasis agents. The
pharmaceutical compositions of the invention can also be administered in conjunction with
radiation therapy. Co-administration with other antibodies, such as CD4 specific antibodies
and IL-2 specific antibodies, are also encompassed by the invention.
[0187]          As used herein, "pharmaceutically acceptable carrier" includes any and all solvents,
dispersion media, coatings, antibacterial and antifungal agents, isotonic and absorption
delaying agents, and the like that are physiologically compatible. Preferably, the carrier is
suitable for intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous, parenteral, spinal or epidermal
administration (e.g., by injection or infusion). Depending on the route of administration, the
active compound, i.e., antibody, bispecific and multispecific molecule, may be coated in a
material to protect the compound from the action of acids and other natural conditions that
may inactivate the compound.
[0188]          A "pharmaceutically acceptable salt" refers to a salt that retains the desired
biological activity of the parent compound and does not impart any undesired toxicological
effects (see e.g., Berge, S. M., et al. (1977) J. Pharm. Sci. 66:1 19). Examples of such salts
include acid addition salts and base addition salts. Acid addition salts include those derived
from nontoxic inorganic acids, such as hydrochloric, nitric, phosphoric, sulfuric,
hydrobromic, hydroiodic, phosphorous and the like, as well as from nontoxic organic acids
such as aliphatic mono- and dicarboxylic acids, phenyl-substituted alkanoic acids, hydroxy
alkanoic acids, aromatic acids, aliphatic and aromatic sulfonic acids and the like. Base
addition salts include those derived from alkaline earth metals, such as sodium, potassium,
magnesium, calcium and the like, as well as from nontoxic organic amines, such as N,N'
dibenzylethylenediamine, N-methylglucamine, chloroprocaine, choline, diethanolamine,
ethylenediamine, procaine and the like.
 [0189]         A composition of the present invention can be administered by a variety of methods
known in the art. As will be appreciated by the skilled artisan, the route and/or mode of
administration will vary depending upon the desired results. The active compounds can be
prepared with carriers that will protect the compound against rapid release, such as a
controlled release formulation, including implants, transdermal patches, and
microencapsulated delivery systems. Biodegradable, biocompatible polymers can be used,
such as ethylene vinyl acetate, polyanhydrides, polyglycolic acid, collagen, polyorthoesters,
and polylactic acid. Many methods for the preparation of such formulations are patented or
                                                    60
10191856_1 (GHMatters) P86720.AU.4

generally known to those skilled in the art. See, e.g., Sustained and Controlled Release Drug
Delivery Systems, J. R. Robinson, ed., Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, 1978.
[0190]          To administer a compound of the invention by certain routes of administration, it
may be necessary to coat the compound with, or co-administer the compound with, a material
to prevent its inactivation. For example, the compound may be administered to a subject in
an appropriate carrier, for example, liposomes, or a diluent. Pharmaceutically acceptable
diluents include saline and aqueous buffer solutions. Liposomes include water-in-oil-in
water CGF emulsions as well as conventional liposomes (Strejan et al. (1984) J.
Neuroimmunol. 7:27).
[0191]          Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include sterile aqueous solutions or dispersions
and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable solutions or
dispersion. The use of such media and agents for pharmaceutically active substances is
known in the art. Except insofar as any conventional media or agent is incompatible with the
active compound, use thereof in the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention is
contemplated. Supplementary active compounds can also be incorporated into the
compositions.
[0192]          Therapeutic compositions typically must be sterile and stable under the conditions
of manufacture and storage. The composition can be formulated as a solution,
microemulsion, liposome, or other ordered structure suitable to high drug concentration. The
carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, polyol
(for example, glycerol, propylene glycol, and liquid polyethylene glycol, and the like), and
suitable mixtures thereof. The proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of a
coating such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of
dispersion and by the use of surfactants. In many cases, it will be preferable to include
isotonic agents, for example, sugars, polyalcohols such as mannitol, sorbitol, or sodium
chloride in the composition. Prolonged absorption of the injectable compositions can be
brought about by including in the composition an agent that delays absorption, for example,
monostearate salts and gelatin.
[0193]          Sterile injectable solutions can be prepared by incorporating the active compound in
the required amount in an appropriate solvent with one or a combination of ingredients
enumerated above, as required, followed by sterilization microfiltration. Generally,
dispersions are prepared by incorporating the active compound into a sterile vehicle that
contains a basic dispersion medium and the required other ingredients from those enumerated
                                                      61
10191856_1 (GHMatters) P86720.AU.4

above. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, the
preferred methods of preparation are vacuum drying and freeze-drying lyophilizationn) that
yield a powder of the active ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient from a
previously sterile-filtered solution thereof.
[0194]          Dosage regimens are adjusted to provide the optimum desired response (e.g., a
therapeutic response). For example, a single bolus may be administered, several divided
doses may be administered over time or the dose may be proportionally reduced or increased
as indicated by the exigencies of the therapeutic situation. For example, the human
antibodies of the invention may be administered once or twice weekly by subcutaneous
injection or once or twice monthly by subcutaneous injection. It is especially advantageous
to formulate parenteral compositions in dosage unit form for ease of administration and
uniformity of dosage. Dosage unit form as used herein refers to physically discrete units
suited as unitary dosages for the subjects to be treated; each unit contains a predetermined
quantity of active compound calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in
association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. The specification for the dosage unit
forms of the invention are dictated by and directly dependent on (a) the unique characteristics
of the active compound and the particular therapeutic effect to be achieved, and (b) the
limitations inherent in the art of compounding such an active compound for the treatment of
sensitivity in individuals.
[0195]          In one embodiment, an agent of the invention is an antibody. As defined herein, a
therapeutically effective amount of antibody (i.e., an effective dosage) ranges from about
0.001 to 30 mg/kg body weight, or about 0.01 to 25 mg/kg body weight, or about 0.1 to 20
mg/kg body weight, or about 1 to 10 mg/kg, 2 to 9 mg/kg, 3 to 8 mg/kg, 4 to 7 mg/kg, or 5 to
6 mg/kg body weight. The skilled artisan will appreciate that certain factors may influence
the dosage required to effectively treat a subject, including but not limited to the severity of
the disease or disorder, previous treatments, the general health and/or age of the subject, and
other diseases present. Moreover, treatment of a subject with a therapeutically effective
amount of an antibody can include a single treatment or, preferably, can include a series of
treatments. It will also be appreciated that the effective dosage of antibody used for
treatment may increase or decrease over the course of a particular treatment. Changes in
dosage may result from the results of diagnostic assays.
[0196]          Examples of pharmaceutically-acceptable antioxidants include: (1) water soluble
antioxidants, such as ascorbic acid, cysteine hydrochloride, sodium bisulfate, sodium
                                                   62
10191856_1 (GHMatters) P86720.AU.4

metabisulfite, sodium sulfite and the like; (2) oil-soluble antioxidants, such as ascorbyl
palmitate, butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), lecithin,
propyl gallate, alpha-tocopherol, and the like; and (3) metal chelating agents, such as citric
acid, ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA), sorbitol, tartaric acid, phosphoric acid, and
the like.
[0197]          For the therapeutic compositions, formulations of the present invention include
those suitable for oral, nasal, topical (including buccal and sublingual), rectal, vaginal and/or
parenteral administration. The formulations may conveniently be presented in unit dosage
form and may be prepared by any methods known in the art of pharmacy. The amount of
active ingredient which can be combined with a carrier material to produce a single dosage
form will vary depending upon the subject being treated, and the particular mode of
administration. The amount of active ingredient which can be combined with a carrier
material to produce a single dosage form will generally be that amount of the composition
which produces a therapeutic effect. Generally, out of one hundred percent, this amount will
range from about 0.001 percent to about ninety percent of active ingredient, alternatively
from about 0.005 percent to about 70 percent, or alternatively from about 0.01 percent to
about 30 percent.
[0198]          Formulations of the present invention which are suitable for vaginal administration
also include pessaries, tampons, creams, gels, pastes, foams or spray formulations containing
such carriers as are known in the art to be appropriate. Dosage forms for the topical or
transdermal administration of compositions of this invention include powders, sprays,
ointments, pastes, creams, lotions, gels, solutions, patches and inhalants. The active
compound may be mixed under sterile conditions with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier,
and with any preservatives, buffers, or propellants which may be required.
[0199]          The phrases "parenteral administration" and "administered parenterally" as used
herein means modes of administration other than enteral and topical administration, usually
by injection, and includes, without limitation, intravenous, intramuscular, intraarterial,
intrathecal, intracapsular, intraorbital, intracardiac, intradermal, intraperitoneal, transtracheal,
subcutaneous, subcuticular, intraarticular, subcapsular, subarachnoid, intraspinal, epidural
and intrastemal injection and infusion.
[0200]          Examples of suitable aqueous and nonaqueous carriers which may be employed in
the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention include water, ethanol, polyols (such as
glycerol, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, and the like), and suitable mixtures thereof,
                                                    63
10191856_1 (GHMatters) P86720.AU.4

vegetable oils, such as olive oil, and injectable organic esters, such as ethyl oleate. Proper
fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of coating materials, such as lecithin, by
the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersions, and by the use of
surfactants.
[0201]          These compositions may also contain adjuvants such as preservatives, wetting
agents, emulsifying agents and dispersing agents. Prevention of presence of microorganisms
may be ensured both by sterilization procedures, supra, and by the inclusion of various
antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, paraben, chlorobutanol, phenol sorbic acid,
and the like. It may also be desirable to include isotonic agents, such as sugars, sodium
chloride, and the like into the compositions. In addition, prolonged absorption of the
injectable pharmaceutical form may be brought about by the inclusion of agents which delay
absorption such as aluminum monostearate and gelatin.
[0202]          When the compounds of the present invention are administered as pharmaceuticals,
to humans and animals, they can be given alone or as a pharmaceutical composition
containing, for example, 0.001 to 90% (e.g., 0.005 to 70%, such as 0.01 to 30%) of active
ingredient in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.
[0203]          Regardless of the route of administration selected, the compounds of the present
invention, which may be used in a suitable hydrated form, and/or the pharmaceutical
compositions of the present invention, are formulated into pharmaceutically acceptable
dosage forms by conventional methods known to those of skill in the art.
[0204]          Actual dosage levels of the active ingredients in the pharmaceutical compositions of
the present invention may be varied so as to obtain an amount of the active ingredient which
is effective to achieve the desired therapeutic response for a particular patient, composition,
and mode of administration, without being toxic to the patient. The selected dosage level
will depend upon a variety of pharmacokinetic factors including the activity of the particular
compositions of the present invention employed, or the ester, salt or amide thereof, the route
of administration, the time of administration, the rate of excretion of the particular compound
being employed, the duration of the treatment, other drugs, compounds and/or materials used
in combination with the particular compositions employed, the age, sex, weight, condition,
general health and prior medical history of the patient being treated, and like factors well
known in the medical arts. A physician or veterinarian having ordinary skill in the art can
readily determine and prescribe the effective amount of the pharmaceutical composition
required. For example, the physician or veterinarian could start doses of the compounds of
                                                     64
10191856_1 (GHMatters) P86720.AU.4

the invention employed in the pharmaceutical composition at levels lower than that required
in order to achieve the desired therapeutic effect and gradually increase the dosage until the
desired effect is achieved. In general, a suitable daily dose of a compositions of the invention
will be that amount of the compound which is the lowest dose effective to produce a
therapeutic effect. Such an effective dose will generally depend upon the factors described
above. It is preferred that administration be intravenous, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, or
subcutaneous, preferably administered proximal to the site of the target. If desired, the
effective daily dose of a therapeutic composition may be administered as two, three, four,
five, six or more sub-doses administered separately at appropriate intervals throughout the
day, optionally, in unit dosage forms. While it is possible for a compound of the present
invention to be administered alone, it is preferable to administer the compound as a
pharmaceutical formulation (composition).
[0205]          Therapeutic compositions can be administered with medical devices known in the
art. For example, in one embodiment, a therapeutic composition of the invention can be
administered with a needleless hypodermic injection device, such as the devices disclosed in
U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,399,163, 5,383,851, 5,312,335, 5,064,413, 4,941,880, 4,790,824, or
4,596,556. Examples of well-known implants and modules useful in the present invention
include: U.S. Pat. No. 4,487,603, which discloses an implantable micro-infusion pump for
dispensing medication at a controlled rate; U.S. Pat. No. 4,486,194, which discloses a
therapeutic device for administering medicants through the skin; U.S. Pat. No. 4,447,233,
which discloses a medication infusion pump for delivering medication at a precise infusion
rate; U.S. Pat. No. 4,447,224, which discloses a variable flow implantable infusion apparatus
for continuous drug delivery; U.S. Pat. No. 4,439,196, which discloses an osmotic drug
delivery system having multi-chamber compartments; and U.S. Pat. No. 4,475,196, which
discloses an osmotic drug delivery system. Many other such implants, delivery systems, and
modules are known to those skilled in the art.
[0206]          In certain embodiments, the human monoclonal antibodies of the invention can be
formulated to ensure proper distribution in vivo. For example, the blood-brain barrier (BBB)
excludes many highly hydrophilic compounds. To ensure that the therapeutic compounds of
the invention cross the BBB (if desired), they can be formulated, for example, in liposomes.
For methods of manufacturing liposomes, see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,522,811; 5,374,548; and
5,399,331. The liposomes may comprise one or more moieties which are selectively
transported into specific cells or organs, thus enhance targeted drug delivery (see, e.g., V. V.
                                                  65

biotin (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,416,016 to Low et al.); mannosides (Umezawa et al., (1988)
Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 153:1038); antibodies (P. G. Bloeman et al. (1995) FEBS
Lett. 357:140; M. Owais et al. (1995) Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 39:180); surfactant
protein A receptor (Briscoe et al. (1995) Am. J. Physiol. 1233:134), different species of
which may comprise the formulations of the inventions, as well as components of the
invented molecules; p120 (Schreier et al. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269:9090); see also K.
Keinanen; M. L. Laukkanen (1994) FEBS Lett. 346:123; J. J. Killion; I. J. Fidler (1994)
Immunomethods 4:273. In one embodiment of the invention, the therapeutic compounds of
the invention are formulated in liposomes; in another embodiment, the liposomes include a
targeting moiety. In yet another embodiment, the therapeutic compounds in the liposomes
are delivered by bolus injection to a site proximal to the tumor or infection. The composition
must be fluid to the extent that easy syringability exists. It must be stable under the
conditions of manufacture and storage and must be preserved against the contaminating
action of microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi.
[0207]          The composition must be sterile and fluid to the extent that the composition is
deliverable by syringe. In addition to water, the carrier can be an isotonic buffered saline
solution, ethanol, polyol (for example, glycerol, propylene glycol, and liquid polyetheylene
glycol, and the like), and suitable mixtures thereof. Proper fluidity can be maintained, for
example, by use of coating such as lecithin, by maintenance of required particle size in the
case of dispersion and by use of surfactants. In many cases, it is preferable to include isotonic
agents, for example, sugars, polyalcohols such as mannitol or sorbitol, and sodium chloride
in the composition. Long-term absorption of the injectable compositions can be brought
about by including in the composition an agent which delays absorption, for example,
aluminum monostearate or gelatin.
[0208]          When the active compound is suitably protected, as described above, the compound
may be orally administered, for example, with an inert diluent or an assimilable edible
carrier.
VIII.        Uses and Methods of the Invention
[0209]          The antibodies described herein (including derivatives and conjugates of the
antibodies) and compositions containing the antibodies can be used in a variety of in vitro
                                                    66
10191856_1 (GHMatters) P86720.AU.4

and in vivo diagnostic and therapeutic applications (e.g., by up- or down-modulating the
immune response). For example, PD-I ligand binding to PD-I or B7-1 transmits an
inhibitory signal. Thus, modulation of the interaction between PD-I and a PD-I ligand, or
between a PD-I ligand and a B7 polypeptide, results in modulation of the immune response.
PD-I ligands can also costimulate T cells. Thus, in one embodiment, antibodies which block
the interaction between a PD-I ligand and PD-I or B7 can prevent inhibitory signaling. In
one embodiment, antibodies that block costimulatory signal of the PD-I ligand block a
costimulatory signal to an immune cell. Furthermore, ligation of PD-L2 can induce cytokine
secretion and survival of dendritic cells. Thus, antibodies that block PD-L2 ligation can
inhibit dendritic cell survival and reduce cytokine expression by dendritic cells, and through
these mechanisms inhibit an immune response. In particular, antibodies described herein are
useful for diagnostic, prognostic, prevention, and therapeutic applications related to particular
conditions mediated by PD-1, PD-L1, and/or PD-L2, as discussed, for example, in Keir et al.
(2008) Annu. Rev. Immunol. 26:677; Sharpe et al., (2007) Nat. Immunol. 8:239; Freeman et
al. (2007) J. Exp. Med. 10:2223; each of which is hereby incorporated by reference in their
entirety.

prevention for persistent infectious disease (e.g., viral infectious diseases including HPV,
HBV, hepatitis C Virus (HCV), retroviruses such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1

[0213]          In yet another embodiment, the antibodies or the antigen-binding fragments of the
present invention are useful for diagnostic, prognostic, prevention, and therapeutic
applications for organ graft rejection, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), allergic disease, and
diseases caused by attenuation of immune reaction, which PD-1, PD-Li, and/or PD-L2
participates, for example, cancer and infectious disease.

              1.            Screening Methods
[0216]          One aspect of the present invention relates to methods of using antibodies of the
present to modulate an immune response by modulating costimulation (such as antibodies
that modulate the function of PD-1, PD-Li, or PD-L2). Such methods utilize screening
assays, including cell based and non-cell based assays. In one embodiment, the assays
provide a method for identifying antibodies which modulate the interaction of a PD-I ligand
and PD-1. In another embodiment, the assays provide a method for identifying antibodies
which modulate the interaction between a PD-I ligand and a B7 polypeptide.
[0217]          In one embodiment, the invention relates to assays for screening candidate or test
antibodies which bind to, or modulate the activity of, PD-1, PD-L1, or PD-L2, e.g., modulate
the ability of the polypeptide to interact with (e.g., bind to) its cognate binding partner. In
one embodiment, a method for identifying an antibody to modulate an immune response
entails determining the ability of the antibody to modulate, e.g. enhance or inhibit, the
interaction between PD-I and a PD-I ligand, and further determining the ability of the
antibody to modulate the interaction between a PD-I ligand and a B7 polypeptide. In one
embodiment, an antibody that modulates the interaction between the PD-I ligand and PD-I
(e.g., without modulating the interaction between the PD-I ligand and the B7 polypeptide is
selected). In another embodiment, an antibody that modulates the interaction between a PD
 I ligand and a B7 polypeptide (e.g., without modulating the interaction between the PD-I
ligand and PD-i) is selected.
[0218]          In another embodiment, a method for identifying an antibody to decrease an
immune response entails determining the ability of a candidate antibody to enhance the
interaction between a PD-I ligand and a B7 polypeptide and selecting an antibody that
inhibits the interaction between the PD-I ligand and the B7 polypeptide. In another
embodiment, a method for identifying an antibody to decrease an immune response entails
determining the ability of the candidate antibody to enhance the interaction between a PD-i
ligand and PD-I and selecting an antibody that enhances the interaction between the PD-I
ligand and PD-1
[0219]          In one embodiment, an assay is a cell-based assay, comprising contacting a cell
expressing PD-1, PD-L1, or PD-L2, with a test antibody and determining the ability of the
test antibody to modulate (e.g. stimulate or inhibit) the binding of PD-I or the PD-I ligand
target to its binding partner. Determining the ability of the PD-1, PD-I ligand or B7
                                                    70
10191856_1 (GHMatters) P86720.AU.4

polypeptide to bind to, or interact with, its binding partner can be accomplished, e.g., by
measuring direct binding or by measuring a parameter of immune cell activation.
[0220]          For example, in a direct binding assay, the PD-I or PD-I ligand protein (or their
respective target polypeptides) can be coupled with a radioisotope or enzymatic label such
that binding of PD-I ligand to PD-I or to the B7 polypeptide can be determined by detecting
the labeled protein in a complex. For example, PD-i or PD-i can be labeled with              125 35,
"C, or 3H, either directly or indirectly, and the radioisotope detected by direct counting of
radioemmission or by scintillation counting. Alternatively, PD-I or PD-I ligand can be
enzymatically labeled with, for example, horseradish peroxidase, alkaline phosphatase, or
luciferase, and the enzymatic label detected by determination of conversion of an appropriate
substrate to product.
[0221]          It is also within the scope of this invention to determine the ability of a compound
to modulate the interaction between PD-I and a PD-I ligand or between a PD-I ligand and a
B7 polypeptide, without the labeling of any of the interactants. For example, a
microphysiometer can be used to detect the interaction of PD-I and a PD-I ligand, or
between a PD-I ligand and a B7 polypeptide, with its target polypeptide, without the labeling
of either PD-1, PD-I ligand, B7 polypeptide, or the target polypeptide (McConnell, H. M. et
al. (1992) Science 257:1906-1912). As used herein, a "microphysiometer" (e.g., Cytosensor)
is an analytical instrument that measures the rate at which a cell acidifies its environment
using a light-addressable potentiometric sensor (LAPS). Changes in this acidification rate
can be used as an indicator of the interaction between compound and receptor.
[0222]          In another embodiment, determining the ability of the antibody to antagonize the
interaction between a given set of polypeptides can be accomplished by determining the
activity of one or more members of the set of polypeptides. For example, the activity of PD
 I or a PD-I ligand can be determined by detecting induction of a cellular second messenger
(e.g., tyrosine kinase activity), detecting catalytic/enzymatic activity of an appropriate
substrate, detecting the induction of a reporter gene (comprising a target-responsive
regulatory element operatively linked to a nucleic acid encoding a detectable marker, e.g.,
chloramphenicol acetyl transferase), or detecting a cellular response regulated by PD-I or the
PD-I ligand. Determining the ability of the antibody to bind to or interact with said
polypeptide can be accomplished, for example, by measuring the ability of a compound to
modulate immune cell costimulation or inhibition in a proliferation assay, or by interfering
with the ability of said polypeptide to bind to antibodies that recognize a portion thereof.
                                                       71
10191856_1 (GHMatters) P86720.AU.4

[0223]          Antibodies that block or inhibit interaction of a PD-i ligand with a costimulatory
receptor as well as antibodies that promote a PD-I ligand-mediated inhibitory signal can be
identified by their ability to inhibit immune cell proliferation, and/or effector function, or to
induce anergy when added to an in vitro assay. For example, cells can be cultured in the
presence of an agent that stimulates signal transduction via an activating receptor. A number
of recognized readouts of cell activation can be employed to measure, cell proliferation or
effector function (e.g., antibody production, cytokine production, phagocytosis) in the
presence of the activating agent. The ability of a test antibody to block this activation can be
readily determined by measuring the ability of the antibody to affect a decrease in
proliferation or effector function being measured, using techniques known in the art.
[0224]          For example, antibodies of the present invention can be tested for the ability to
inhibit or enhance costimulation in a T cell assay, as described in Freeman et al. (2000) J
Exp. Med. 192:1027 and Latchman et al. (2001) Nat. Immunol. 2:261. CD4+ T cells can be
isolated from human PBMCs and stimulated with activating anti-CD3 antibody. Proliferation
of T cells can be measured by 3H thymidine incorporation. An assay can be performed with
or without CD28 costimulation in the assay. Similar assays can be performed with Jurkat T
cells and PHA-blasts from PBMCs.
[0225]          In yet another embodiment, an assay of the present invention is a cell-free assay in
which PD-I or a PD-I ligand or a biologically active portion thereof, is contacted with a test
antibody, and the ability of the test antibody to bind to the polypeptide, or biologically active
portion thereof, is determined. Binding of the test antibody to the PD-i or PD-i ligand
polypeptide can be determined either directly or indirectly as described above. In still
another embodiment, the assay includes contacting the polypeptide, or biologically active
portion thereof, with its binding partner to form an assay mixture, contacting the assay
mixture with a test antibody, and determining the ability of the test antibody to interact with
the polypeptide in the assay mixture, wherein determining the ability of the test antibody to
interact with the polypeptide comprises determining the ability of the test antibody to
preferentially bind to the polypeptide or biologically active portion thereof, as compared to
the binding partner.
[0226]          For example, a PD-i ligand and a PD-i polypeptide can be used to form an assay
mixture and the ability of a test antibody to block this interaction can be tested by
determining the ability of PD-I to bind the PD-I ligand and determining the ability of the
PD-I ligand to bind the PD-I polypeptide, by one of the methods described above for
                                                      72
10191856_1 (GHMatters) P86720.AU.4

determining binding. Determining the ability of a PD-I polypeptide to bind a PD-I ligand
and determining the ability of a PD-I ligand to bind a B7 polypeptide can also be
accomplished using a technology such as real-time Biomolecular Interaction Analysis (BIA)
(Sjolander, S. and Urbaniczky, C. (1991) Anal. Chem. 63:2338-2345 and Szabo et al. (1995)
Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 5:699-705). As used herein, "BIA" is a technology for studying
biospecific interactions in real time, without labeling any of the interactants (e.g., BlAcore).
Changes in the optical phenomenon of surface plasmon resonance (SPR) can be used as an
indication of real-time reactions between biological polypeptides. PD-1, PD-i ligand, and
B7 polypeptide can be immobilized on a BlAcore chip and antibodies can be tested for
binding to PD-1, PD-I ligand, and B7 polypeptide. An example of using the BIA technology
is described by Fitz et al. (1997) Oncogene 15:613.
[0227]          The cell-free assays of the present invention are amenable to use of both soluble
and/or membrane-bound forms of proteins (e.g., a PD-I ligand or PD-I proteins or
biologically active portions thereof, or binding partners to which a PD-i ligand or PD-i
binds). In the case of cell-free assays in which a membrane-bound form protein is used (e.g.,
a cell surface PD-i ligand or PD-i receptor) it may be desirable to utilize a solubilizing agent
such that the membrane-bound form of the protein is maintained in solution. Examples of
such solubilizing agents include non-ionic detergents such as n-octylglucoside, n
dodecylglucoside, n-dodecylmaltoside, octanoyl-N-methylglucamide, decanoyl-N
methylglucamide, Triton X-100, Triton X- 114, Thesit@, Isotridecypoly(ethylene glycol
ether)n, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylamminio]-1 -propane sulfonate (CHAPS), 3-[(3
cholamidopropyl)dimethylamminio] -2-hydroxy- I-propane sulfonate (CHAPSO), or N
dodecyl=N,N-dimethyl-3-ammonio-1 -propane sulfonate.
[0228]          In one or more embodiments of the above described assay methods, it may be
desirable to immobilize either PD-1, a PD-I ligand, and a B7 polypeptide, or an appropriate
target polypeptide, to facilitate separation of complexed from uncomplexed forms of one or
both of the proteins, as well as to accommodate automation of the assay. Binding of a test
antibody to PD-I or a PD-I ligand can be accomplished in any vessel suitable for containing
the reactants. Examples of such vessels include microtiter plates, test tubes, and micro
centrifuge tubes. In one embodiment, a fusion protein can be provided which adds a domain
that allows one or both of the proteins to be bound to a matrix. For example, glutathione-S
transferase/ PD-1, PD-i ligand, or B7 polypeptide fusion proteins, or glutathione-S
                                                      73
10191856_1 (GHMatters) P86720.AU.4

transferase/target fusion proteins, can be adsorbed onto glutathione sepharose beads (Sigma
Chemical, St. Louis, MO) or glutathione derivatized microtiter plates, which are then
combined with the test compound, and the mixture incubated under conditions conducive to
complex formation (e.g., at physiological conditions for salt and pH). Following incubation,
the beads or microtiter plate wells are washed to remove any unbound components, the
matrix immobilized in the case of beads, complex determined either directly or indirectly, for
example, as described above. Alternatively, the complexes can be dissociated from the
matrix, and the level of PD-1, PD-I ligand, or B7 polypeptide binding or activity determined
using standard techniques.
[0229]          In an alternative embodiment, determining the ability of the test compound to
modulate the activity of PD-I or a PD-I ligand can be accomplished by determining the
ability of the test antibody to modulate the activity of a polypeptide that functions
downstream of PD-i or the PD-i ligand, e.g., a polypeptide that interacts with the PD-i
ligand, or a polypeptide that functions downstream of PD-1, e.g., by interacting with the
cytoplasmic domain of PD-1. For example, levels of second messengers can be determined,
the activity of the interactor polypeptide on an appropriate target can be determined, or the
binding of the interactor to an appropriate target can be determined as previously described.
[0230]          This invention further pertains to novel antibodies identified by the above-described
screening assays. Accordingly, it is within the scope of this invention to further use an
antibody identified as described herein in an appropriate animal model. For example, an
antibody identified as described herein can be used in an animal model to determine the
efficacy, toxicity, or side effects of treatment with such an antibody. Alternatively, an
antibody identified as described herein can be used in an animal model to determine the
mechanism of action of such an antibody. Furthermore, this invention pertains to uses of
novel antibodies identified by the above-described screening assays for treatments as
described herein.
             2.            Prophylactic Methods
[0231]          In one aspect, the invention relates to a method for preventing in a subject, a disease
or condition associated with an unwanted or less than desirable immune response. Subjects
at risk for a disease that would benefit from treatment with the claimed antibodies or methods
can be identified, for example, by any or a combination of diagnostic or prognostic assays
known in the art. Administration of a prophylactic antibody can occur prior to the
manifestation of symptoms associated with an unwanted or less than desirable immune
                                                      74
10191856_1 (GHMatters) P86720.AU.4

response. The appropriate antibody used for treatment can be determined based on clinical
indications and can be identified, e.g., using screening assays described herein.
             3.             Therapeutic Methods
[0232]          Another aspect of the invention pertains to therapeutic methods of modulating an
immune response, e.g., by modulating the interaction between PD-I and a PD-I ligand and/or
a PD-I ligand and a B7 polypeptide. For example, modulation of the interaction between
PD-I and a PD-I ligand, or between a PD-I ligand and a B7 polypeptide, results in
modulation of the immune response. Thus, in one embodiment, antibodies which block the
interaction between PD-I and the PD-I ligand can prevent inhibitory signaling. PD-I ligands
can also enhance costimulatory signals in T cells. Thus, in another embodiment, antibodies
that prevent PD-I ligand from providing a costimulatory signal can inhibit T cell
costimulation.
[0233]          These modulatory antibodies can be administered in vitro (e.g., by contacting the
cell with an antibody) or, alternatively, in vivo (e.g., by administering the agent to a subject).
As such, the present invention relates to methods of treating an individual afflicted with a
disease or disorder that would benefit from modulation of an immune response, e.g., by
modulation of the interaction between a PD-I ligand and PD-1, or a B7 polypeptide.
             4.             Downregulation of Immune Responses
[0234]          There are numerous embodiments of the invention for upregulating the inhibitory
function or downregulating the costimulatory function of a PD-I ligand to thereby
downregulate immune responses. Downregulation can be in the form of inhibiting or
blocking an immune response already in progress, or may involve preventing the induction of
an immune response. The functions of activated immune cells can be inhibited by down
regulating immune cell responses, or by inducing specific anergy in immune cells, or both.
[0235]          For example, the immune response can be downmodulated using: anti-PD-i ligand
antibodies that blocks costimulation by PD-I ligand (e.g., while not affecting or increasing
the interaction between PD-LI and PD-i) or which promote the binding of a PD-I ligand
with PD-1, (e.g., while not affecting or while inhibiting costimulation by PD-I ligand).
[0236]          In one embodiment of the invention, tolerance is induced against specific antigens
by co-administering an antigen with an antibody which blocks PD-i ligand costimulation.
For example, tolerance can be induced to specific proteins. In one embodiment, immune
responses to allergens, or to foreign proteins to which an immune response is undesirable,
                                                       75
10191856_1 (GHMatters) P86720.AU.4

can be inhibited. For example, patients that receive Factor VIII frequently generate
antibodies against this clotting factor. Co-administration of an antibody that blocks a PD-i
ligand-mediated costimulatory signal or an antibody that stimulates a PD-I mediated
inhibitory signal in combination with recombinant factor VIII (or by physically linked to
Factor VIII, e.g., by cross-linking) can result in downmodulation.
[0237]          In one embodiment, two separate agents that downmodulate immune responses can
be combined as a single composition or administered separately (simultaneously or
sequentially) to more effectively downregulate immune cell mediated immune responses in a
subject. Furthermore, a therapeutically active amount of one or more of the subject
antibodies, can be used in conjunction with other downmodulating reagents to influence
immune responses. Examples of other immunomodulating reagents include, without
limitation, antibodies that block a costimulatory signal, (e.g., against CD28 or ICOS),
antibodies that act as agonists of CTLA4, and/or antibodies against other immune cell
markers (e.g., against CD40, against CD40 ligand, or against cytokines), fusion proteins
(e.g., CTLA4-Fc), and immunosuppressive drugs, (e.g., rapamycin, cyclosporine A or
FK506).
[0238]          Downregulating or preventing a PD-i ligand costimulation, or promoting an
interaction between a PD-I ligand and PD-I is useful to downmodulate the immune response,
e.g., in situations of tissue, skin and organ transplantation, in graft-versus-host disease
(GVHD), or in inflammatory diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus, and multiple
sclerosis. For example, blockage of immune cell function results in reduced tissue
destruction in tissue transplantation. Typically, in tissue transplants, rejection of the
transplant is initiated through its recognition as foreign by immune cells, followed by an
immune reaction that destroys the transplant. The administration of an antibody which
inhibits PD-I ligand costimulation alone or in conjunction with another downmodulatory
agent, prior to or at the time of transplantation can promote the generation of an inhibitory
signal. Moreover, inhibition of PD-I ligand costimulatory signals, or promotion of a PD-I
ligand or PD-I inhibitory signals, may also be sufficient to anergize the immune cells,
thereby inducing tolerance in a subject. Induction of long-term tolerance by blocking a PD-i
ligand mediated costimulatory signal may avoid the necessity of repeated administration of
these blocking reagents.
[0239]          To achieve sufficient immunosuppression or tolerance in a subject, it may also be
desirable to block the costimulatory function of other polypeptides. For example, it may be
                                                  76
10191856_1 (GHMatters) P86720.AU.4

desirable to block the function of B7-1, B7-2, or B7-1 and B7-2 by administering a soluble
form of a combination of peptides having an activity of each of these antigens, blocking
antibodies against these antigens or blocking small molecules (separately or together in a
single composition) prior to or at the time of transplantation. Alternatively, it may be
desirable to promote inhibitory activity of a PD-I ligand or PD-I and inhibit a costimulatory
activity of B7-1 and/or B7-2. Other downmodulatory agents that can be used in connection
with the downmodulatory methods of the invention include, for example, agents that transmit
an inhibitory signal via CTLA4, soluble forms of CTLA4, antibodies that activate an
inhibitory signal via CTLA4, blocking antibodies against other immune cell markers or
soluble forms of other receptor ligand pairs (e.g., agents that disrupt the interaction between
CD40 and CD40 ligand (e.g., anti CD40 ligand antibodies)), antibodies against cytokines, or
immunosuppressive drugs.
[0240]          Downmodulation of immune responses are also useful in treating autoimmune
disease. Many autoimmune disorders are the result of inappropriate activation of immune
cells that are reactive against self tissue and which promote the production of cytokines and
autoantibodies involved in the pathology of the diseases. Preventing the activation of
autoreactive immune cells may reduce or eliminate disease symptoms. Administration of
reagents which block costimulation of immune cells by disrupting interactions between PD-I
ligand and B7 polypeptides, or by promoting the interaction between PD-I ligand and PD-1,
without modulating or while downmodulating the interaction between PD-I ligand and a B7
polypeptide, are useful for inhibiting immune cell activation and preventing production of
autoantibodies or cytokines which may be involved in the disease process. Additionally,
agents that promote an inhibitory function of a PD-I ligand or PD-I may induce antigen
specific tolerance of autoreactive immune cells, which could lead to long-term relief from the
disease. The efficacy of reagents in preventing or alleviating autoimmune disorders can be
determined using a number of well-characterized animal models of human autoimmune
diseases. Examples include murine experimental autoimmune encephalitis, systemic lupus
erythematosus in MRL/lpr/lpr mice or NZB hybrid mice, murine autoimmune collagen
arthritis, diabetes mellitus in NOD mice and BB rats, and murine experimental myasthenia
gravis (see, e.g., Paul ed., FundamentalImmunology, Raven Press, New York, Third Edition
 1993, chapter 30).
 [0241]         Inhibition of immune cell activation is useful therapeutically in the treatment of
allergy and allergic reactions, e.g., by inhibiting IgE production. An antibody that promotes
                                                     77
10191856_1 (GHMatters) P86720.AU.4

a PD-1 ligand or PD-1 inhibitory function can be administered to an allergic subject to inhibit
immune cell mediated allergic responses in the subject. Inhibition of PD-1 ligand
costimulation of immune cells or stimulation of a PD-I ligand or PD-I inhibitory pathway
can be accompanied by exposure to allergen in conjunction with appropriate MHC
polypeptides. Allergic reactions can be systemic or local in nature, depending on the route of
entry of the allergen and the pattern of deposition of IgE on mast cells or basophils. Thus,
inhibition of immune cell mediated allergic responses locally or systemically by
administration of an inhibitory form of an agent that inhibits the interaction of a PD-1 ligand
with a costimulatory receptor, or an antibody that promotes an inhibitory function of a PD-I
ligand or PD-1.
[0242]          Inhibition of immune cell activation through blockage of PD-I ligand
costimulation, or through promotion of the interaction between a PD-I ligand and PD-1, may
also be important therapeutically in viral infections of immune cells. For example, in the
acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), viral replication is stimulated by immune cell
activation. Modulation of these interactions may result in inhibition of viral replication and
thereby ameliorate the course of AIDS. Modulation of these interactions may also be useful
in promoting the maintenance of pregnancy. PD-I ligand is normally highly expressed in
placental trophoblasts, the layer of cells that forms the interface between mother and fetus
and may play a role in preventing maternal rejection of the fetus. Females at risk for
spontaneous abortion (e.g., those who have previously had a spontaneous abortion or those
who have had difficulty conceiving) because of immunologic rejection of the embryo or fetus
can be treated with agents that modulate these interactions.
[0243]          Downregulation of an immune response by modulation of PD-1 ligand
costimulation or by modulation of PD-I ligand / PD-I binding may also be useful in treating
an autoimmune attack of autologous tissues. For example, PD-1 ligand is normally highly
expressed in the heart and may protect the heart from autoimmune attack. This is evidenced
by the fact that the Balb/c PD-I knockout mouse exhibits massive autoimmune attack on the
heart with thrombosis. Thus, conditions that are caused or exacerbated by autoimmune
attack (e.g., in this example, heart disease, myocardial infarction or atherosclerosis) may be
ameliorated or improved by modulation of these interactions. It is therefore within the scope
of the invention to modulate conditions exacerbated by autoimmune attack, such as
autoimmune disorders (as well as conditions such as heart disease, myocardial infarction, and
atherosclerosis).
                                                     78
10191856_1 (GHMatters) P86720.AU.4

             5.            Upregulation of Immune Responses
[0244]          Also useful therapeutically is the blockage of the interaction of a PD-i ligand with
PD-I or B7-1 as a means of upregulating an immune response. Upregulation of immune
responses can be in the form of enhancing an existing immune response or eliciting an initial
immune response. For instance, enhancing an immune response using the subject
compositions and methods is useful in cases of infections with microbes (e.g., bacteria,
viruses, or parasites).            In one embodiment, an antibody that blocks the interaction of a PD-i
ligand with PD-I is used to enhance the immune response. Such an antibody (e.g., a non
activating antibody that blocks PD-LI binding to PD-1) is therapeutically useful in situations
where upregulation of antibody and cell-mediated responses would be beneficial. Exemplary
disorders include viral skin diseases, such as Herpes or shingles, in which case such an agent
can be delivered topically to the skin. In addition, systemic viral diseases such as influenza,
the common cold, and encephalitis might be alleviated by systemic administration of such
agents.
 [0245]         Alternatively, immune responses can be enhanced in an infected patient through an
ex vivo approach, for instance, by removing immune cells from the patient, contacting
immune cells in vitro with an antibody that blocks the interaction of a PD-i ligand with PD-i
and reintroducing the in vitro stimulated immune cells into the patient.
 [0246]         In certain instances, it may be desirable to further administer other agents that
upregulate immune responses, for example, forms of other B7 family members that transduce
signals via costimulatory receptors, in order to further augment the immune response.
 [0247]         An antibody that blocks the interaction of a PD-i ligand with PD-i or B7-1 can be
used prophylactically in vaccines against various polypeptides (e.g., polypeptides derived
from pathogens). Immunity against a pathogen (e.g., a virus) can be induced by vaccinating
with a viral protein along with an antibody that blocks the interaction of a PD-i ligand with
PD-i or B7-1 in an appropriate adjuvant.
 [0248]         In another embodiment, upregulation or enhancement of an immune response
function, as described herein, is useful in the induction of tumor immunity
 [0249]         In another embodiment, the immune response can be stimulated by the methods
described herein, such that preexisting tolerance is overcome. For example, immune
responses against antigens to which a subject cannot mount a significant immune response,
e.g., to an autologous antigen, such as a tumor specific antigens can be induced by
                                                        79
10191856_1 (GHMatters) P86720.AU.4

administering an antibody that blocks the interaction of a PD-I ligand with PD-1. In one
embodiment, an autologous antigen, such as a tumor-specific antigen can be coadministered.
In another embodiment, an immune response can be stimulated against an antigen (e.g., an
autologous antigen) to treat a neurological disorder. In another embodiment, the subject
agents can be used as adjuvants to boost responses to foreign antigens in the process of active
immunization.
[0250]          In one embodiment, immune cells are obtained from a subject and cultured ex vivo
in the presence of an antibody as described herein, to expand the population of immune cells
and/or to enhance immune cell activation. In a further embodiment the immune cells are then
administered to a subject. Immune cells can be stimulated in vitro by, for example, providing
to the immune cells a primary activation signal and a costimulatory signal, as is known in the
art. Various agents can also be used to costimulate proliferation of immune cells. In one
embodiment immune cells are cultured ex vivo according to the method described in PCT
Application No. WO 94/29436. The costimulatory polypeptide can be soluble, attached to a
cell membrane, or attached to a solid surface, such as a bead.
 [0251]         Other embodiments of the present invention are described in the following
Examples. The present invention is further illustrated by the following examples which
should not be construed as further limiting. The contents of Sequence Listing, figures and all
references, patents and published patent applications cited throughout this application are
expressly incorporated herein by reference.
EXAMPLES
 [0252]         The examples below describe the generation of monoclonal antibodies suitable for
therapeutic purposes targeting human PD-1, PD-Li and PD-L2. Composite, human anti
human PD-1, PD-LI and PD-L2 antibodies were generated from mouse anti-human
EH12.2H7, 29E.2A3 and 24F.10Ci2 antibodies, respectively. Segments of human V region
sequence were sourced from unrelated human antibody (germline and non-germline)
sequence databases. Each selected sequence segment (as well as the junctions between
segments) was tested for the potential to bind to MHC class II using binding prediction
algorithms. All final composite, human antibody sequence variants were designed to avoid T
cell epitopes. Composite, human antibody V region genes were generated using synthetic
oligonucleotides encoding combinations of the human sequence segments. These were then
                                                   80
10191856_1 (GHMatters) P86720.AU.4

cloned into vectors containing human constant regions, and antibodies were produced and
tested for binding to target antigens by competition ELISA.
Example 1: Design of Composite, Human Antibody Variable Region Sequences
[0253]          Structural models of the mouse EH12.2H7, 29E.2A3 and 24F.10C12 V regions
were produced using Swiss Pdb and analyzed in order to identify important "constraining"
amino acids in the mouse V regions that might be essential for the binding properties of the
antibodies. Only residues contained within the CDRs were considered to be important,
including CDR residues defined under both Kabat and Chothia definitions.
[0254]          From the above analysis, it was considered that composite, human forms of
EH12.2H7, 29E.2A3 and 24F.10C12 could be created with wide latitude of sequences
outside of CDRs but with a narrow menu of possible alternative residues within the CDR
sequences. Preliminary analysis indicated that corresponding sequence segments from
several human antibodies could be combined to create CDRs similar or identical to those in
the mouse sequences. For regions outside of and flanking the CDRs, a wide selection of
human sequence segments were identified as possible components of the novel composite,
human antibody variable regions.
[0255]          Based upon the above analysis, a large preliminary set of sequence segments that
could be used to create EH12.2H7, 29E.2A3 and 24F.10C12 composite, human antibody
variants were selected and analyzed via MHC class II binding prediction algorithms and
BLAST searched through a proprietary database of known antibody sequence related T cell
epitopes. Sequence segments where potential MHC class II binding peptides were identified,
or scored significant hits against the database of known T cell epitopes, were discarded. This
resulted in a reduced set of segments, and combinations of these were again analyzed, as
above, to ensure that junctions between segments did not contain potential T cell epitopes.
Selected segments were then combined to produce heavy and light chain variable region
sequences for synthesis. For all three antibodies, five heavy chains and four light chains
were constructed with sequences detailed as follows;

Example 2: Generation and Testing of Composite, Human Antibodies
[0257]          Initial variant 1 composite, human antibody VH and VK region genes were
synthesized for EH12.2H7, 29E.2A3 and 24F.10C12 using a series of overlapping
oligonucleotides that were annealed, ligated and PCR amplified to give full length synthetic
V-regions (Figure 2A, Figure 3A, Figure 4A, Figure 5A, Figure 6A and Figure 7A). For
each composite, human antibody, subsequent sequence variants were constructed using long
overlapping oligonucleotides and PCR, using the initial variant 1 as the template. The
assembled variants were then cloned directly into expression vectors (Figure 1) and their
sequences were verified.
[0258]          All combinations of chimeric and composite heavy and light chains (i.e. a total of
20 pairings for each antibody) were stably transfected into NSO cells by electroporation and
selected in media (high glucose DMEM with L-glutamine and Na pyruvate, 5% ultra-low
IgG FCS, pen/strep - all from Invitrogen) containing 200nM methotrexate. Several drug
resistant colonies for each construct were tested for expression levels and the best expressing
lines were selected and frozen under liquid nitrogen.
[0259]          Supernatants from the best expressing lines for each combination were quantified
using an Fc capture, Kappa light chain detection ELISA in comparison to a IgG 1/kappa
standard. The quantified supernatants were then tested in a competition ELISA for binding
to their target antigen. Ninety-six well MaxisorbTM plates (Nunc) were coated overnight at
4'C with 50[tl/well of 1 [g/ml human Fc-PD-1, Fc-PD-L1 or Fc-PD-L2 (R&D systems) in
carbonate buffer pH 9.6. Duplicate titrations of mouse reference antibody and composite,
human antibody samples were generated (in the range 0.0078 [g/ml to 8 [g/ml) and mixed
with a constant concentration (40 ng/ml) of biotinylated mouse reference antibody in PBS pH
7.4/2% BSA. The titrations, 100 1tl/well, were added to washed (4x with PBS pH 7.4/0.05%
Tween 20) assay plates and incubated at room temperature for 1 hour. Plates were washed as
above and 100 l/well of a 1/1000 dilution of streptavidin HRP (Sigma) in PBS pH 7.4/2%
BSA was added and incubated for a further 1 hour at room temperature. After a further wash,
bound biotinylated reference antibody was detected with 100 l/well OPD substrate.
Absorbance was measured at 490nm and the binding curves of the test antibodies were
compared to the mouse reference standard. Absorbance was plotted against sample
concentration and straight lines were fitted through each of the data sets. The equations of
the lines were used to calculate the concentration required to inhibit Biotin-EH12.2H7

binding to PD-1, Biotin-29E.2A3 binding to PD-LI and Biotin-24F.IOC12 binding to human
PD-L2 by 50% (IC 5 0).
[0260]          The antibodies with the best IC 50 were selected and cell lines for all these variants
of EHI2.2H7, 29E.2A3 and 24F.IOC12 antibodies were bulked up to 100 ml and grown to
saturation. Antibodies were purified from each culture via protein A affinity
chromatography. Briefly, supernatants were pH adjusted with 0.1 volume of I0x PBS pH 7.4
and passed over Iml Mab Select Sure protein A columns (GE Healthcare). The columns
were washed with 10 volumes of PBS pH 7.4 before elution with 50mM citrate buffer pH
3.0. 1 ml fractions were collected and immediately neutralized with 0. 1 ml of Im Tris-HCl
pH 9.0. Protein containing fractions (as judged by absorbance at 280nm) were pooled, buffer
exchanged into PBS pH 7.4 and the purified antibodies stored at +4'C. Figures 8A-C shows
a SDS-PAGE gel of I [g of each antibody, stained with coomassie blue. The concentrations
of the antibodies were calculated by UV absorption based upon calculated molar extinction
coefficients such that E0. 1%at 280nm       =  1.61 for EH12.2H7, E0.1%at 280nm      =   1.46 for
29E.2A3 and E0.1% at 280nm          = 1.57 for 24F.10Ci2.
[0261]          The purified antibodies were tested for binding to human Fc-PD-i, Fc-PD-Li or Fc
PD-L2 via competition ELISA as described above. Titrations of the test antibodies were
done from 0.0625 [g/ml to 8.0 [g/ml in duplicate. Absorbance at 490nm was measured and
this was plotted against test antibody concentration (Figures 9A-C, I0A-C).
[0262]          Table 4 summarizes the results for the combinations of the composite VH and VK
variant sequences for the anti-PD-1, PD-LI and PD-L2 antibodies. For EHI2.2H7 all the
humanized antibodies have an IC50 that is improved compared to the mouse reference,
particularly VH4/VK3 that has a two-fold increase in binding. In the case of 29E.2A3,
variants VH2/VK1 and VH2/VK4 have equivalent binding to the mouse reference whereas
variants VH2/VK2 and VH4/VK2 have reduced binding by 1.75 and 1.36 fold respectively.
For 24F.I0C12, all selected variants have similar, but slightly reduced, binding compared to
the mouse reference (1. 13 fold).

[0263]          As a result of these experiments, composite, human antibodies specific for human
PD-1, PD-Li and PD-L2 have been constructed from amino acid sequence segments derived
entirely from unrelated human antibody variable regions. All CDR and framework regions
in the composite, human antibody variants comprised more than one unrelated human
sequence segment (sourced from the human sequence database), and all composite, human
antibodies were designed specifically to avoid T cell epitopes. Four lead candidates were
initially selected for binding to human PD-1, PD-Li or PD-L2 and, upon subsequent analysis,
were demonstrated to have binding within two-fold of the murine antibody.
Example 5: Enhanced stimulation of T cell activation by inhibition of PD-i:PD-ligand
interaction
[0264]          The PD-i signaling pathway inhibits moderate TCR/CD28 costimulatory signals,
with cytokine production being reduced first without a decrease in T cell proliferation. As the
TCR/CD28 costimulatory signals weaken, the PD-I pathway dominates, with a great
reduction in cytokine production accompanied by a reduction in proliferation. Accordingly,
in order to confirm that the inhibition of the PD-I pathway via inhibition of the interaction
with PD-Li or PD-L2 using composite, human antibodies of the invention enhances T cell
activation, mixed lymphocyte reactions (MLRs) are performed.
[0265]          Immature myeloid dendritic cells are isolated by culturing human peripheral blood
monocytes in IL-4 and GM-CSF. Exposure of immature dendritic cells to an inflammatory
cocktail of IL-iI3, TNF-ca, IL-6, and PGE 2 elicits the development of mature dendritic cells
                                                    91

that function as APCs. However, the addition of IL-10 to the inflammatory cytokines given
during the maturation phase results in APCs that function only 1/6 to 1/3 as well.
[0266]          T cell activation assays (MLRs) are performed, using IL-10 treated dendritic cells
as APCs, in the presence of composite, human antibodies to PD-1, PD-Li and/or PD-L2, or
control antibodies. The addition of anti-PD-1, anti-PD-Li and/or PD-L2 mAb to cultures of
IL-i 0 treated dendritic cells plus allogeneic T cells is predicted to result in an increase in T
cell proliferation and cytokine expression, as compared to control IgG treated cultures. A
combination of anti-PD-i antibodies with anti-PD-Li antibodies, anti-PD-L2 antibodies, may
also result in an increase in stimulation greater than that seen with either antibody alone.
Example 6: Inhibition of the PD-i Pathway in Chronically-Infected Mice
[0267]          Mice infected with various strains of the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus
(LCMV) are used to study the effect of chronic viral infection on CD8 T cell function. The
LCMV Armstrong strain causes an acute infection that is cleared within 8 days, leaving
behind a long-lived population of highly functional, resting memory CD8 T cells. The
LCMV Cl-13 strain, in contrast, establishes a persistent infection in the host, characterized by
a viremia that lasts up to 3 months.
[0268]          To confirm that blocking the PD-I signaling restores T cell function and enhances
viral control during chronic LCMV infection, the PD-i signalling is disrupted during chronic
LCMV infection using composite, human anti-PD-I antibodies, anti-PD-LI antibodies and/or
anti-PD-L2 antibodies of the invention. The antibodies are administered every third day to
mice infected with LCMV Cl-13 from day 23 to day 37 post-infection. It is expected that at
day 37 there will be several-fold more LCMV specific CD8 T cells in treated mice relative to
the untreated controls. It is also expected that the induction of proliferation will be specific to
CD8 T cells since and the number of CD4 T cells in the spleen will probably be
approximately the same in both treated mice and untreated mice.
[0269]          In addition to an increase in CD8 T cell proliferation, it is expected that the
inhibition of PD-I signaling will also result in an increased production of anti-viral cytokines
in virus-specific CD8 T cells. The production of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha by CD8 T cells
will likely be several-fold higher in treated mice as compared to untreated mice. Viral
clearance should also be accelerated, and reduced viral titers should be observed in the lung
and kidney by day 37 post-infection in treated mice, while untreated mice likely will display
significant levels of virus in all these tissues.

[0270]          CD4 T cells play a key role in the generation and maintenance of CD8 T cell
responses. In this regard, CD8 T cells primed in the absence of CD4 T cells are incapable of
mounting normal immune responses, and are thus often referred to as "helpless T cells."
Furthermore, chronic LCMV infection is more severe in the absence of CD4 T cells.
Accordingly, helpless T cells generated during LCMV-Cl- 13 infection display an even more
profound functional impairment than T cells generated in the presence of CD4 T cells.
[0271]          CD4 T cells are depleted at the time of LCMV-Cl-13 infection and mice are treated
with composite, human anti-PD-I antibodies, anti-PD-LI antibodies and/or anti-PD-LI
antibodies of the present invention from day 46 to day 60 post-infection. It is expected that
following treatment, treated mice likely will have several-fold more LCMV-specific CD8T
cells in their spleen than untreated control mice. This increase in virus-specific CD8 T cells
in treated mice likely will be the result to an increase in proliferation, as detected by BrdU
incorporation. BrdU analysis is performed by introducing I mg/ml BrdU in the drinking
water during treatment and staining is performed according to the manufacturer's protocol
(BD Biosciences, San Diego, Calif.).
[0272]          To confirm that the inhibition of PD-I signals increases the lytic activity of
helpless, exhausted, virus-specific CD8 T cells, ex vivo lytic activity of virus-specific CD8 T
cells is detected following treatment using a       5Cr release assay (Wherry et al., 2003. J. Virol.
77:4911-27). Viral titers are expected to be reduced by several-fold in the spleen, liver, lung,
and serum after 2 weeks of treatment relative to untreated mice.
Example 7: Administration of a Vaccine with an inhibitor of PD-I Signaling
[0273]          One approach for boosting T cell responses during a persistent infection is
therapeutic vaccination. The rationale for this approach is that endogenous antigens may not
be presented in an optimal or immunogenic manner during chronic viral infection and that
providing antigen in the form of a vaccine may provide a more effective stimulus for virus
specific T and B cells. Using the chronic LCMV model, mice are administered a recombinant
vaccinia virus expressing the LCMV GP33 epitope as a therapeutic vaccine (VVGP33),
which results in a modest enhancement of CD8 T cell responses in some chronically infected
mice. This therapeutic vaccination is combined with composite, human anti-PD-I antibodies,
anti-PD-LI antibodies and/or anti-PD-L2 antibodies of the invention. It is expected that
LCMV specific T cell responses will be boosted to a greater level than compared to either
treatment alone and the effect of combined treatment will likely be more than additive.

Example 8: Chimpanzees as a Model for Immunotherapy of Persistent HCV Infection.
[0274]          Chimpanzees provide a model of HCV persistence in humans. Defects in T cell
immunity leading to life-long virus persistence both include a deficit in HCV-specific CD4
helper T cells and impaired or altered CD8 effector T cell activity. Persistently infected
chimpanzees are treated with composite, human anti-PD-I antibodies, anti-PD-Li antibodies
and/or anti-PD-L2 antibodies of the invention. The efficacy of blockade of the inhibitory
pathways, combined with vaccination using recombinant structural and non-structural HCV
proteins, and whether such strategies can enhance the frequency and longevity of virus
specific memory T cells are determined. The defect in T cell immunity is exclusively HCV
specific in persistently infected humans and chimpanzees. Antiviral activity may then be
restored by delivering to chimpanzees humanized monoclonal antibodies that block signaling
through these molecules.
[0275]          Persistently infected chimpanzees are treated with composite, human anti-PD-1
antibodies, anti-PD-Li antibodies and/or anti-PD-L2 antibodies of the invention. After
treatment with antibodies, the humoral and cellular immune responses as well as the HCV
RNA load are determined. Samples are collected at weeks 1, 2, 3, 5, and 8, and then at
monthly intervals. Samples include: 1) serum for analysis of transaminases, autoantibodies,
neutralizing antibodies to HCV, and cytokine responses, 2) plasma for viral load and genome
evolution, 3) PBMC for in vitro measures of immunity, costimulatory/inhibitory receptor
expression and function, 4) fresh (unfixed) liver for isolation of intrahepatic lymphocytes and
RNA, and 5) fixed (formalin/paraffin embedded) liver for histology and
immunohistochemical analysis. Regional lymph nodes are also collected at 2 or 3 time points
to assess expression of co-inhibitory molecules and splice variants by immunohistochemistry
and molecular techniques.
[0276]          To determine if vaccination with HCV antigens potentiates the therapeutic effect of
the antibodies, chimpazees are treated as follows: 1) intramuscular immunization with
recombinant envelope glycoproteins El and E2 (in MF59 adjuvant) and other proteins (core
plus NS 3, 4, and 5 formulated with ISCOMS) at weeks 0, 4, and 24; 2) intramuscular
immunization with the vaccine used in, but co-administered with composite, human anti-PD
 I antibodies, anti-PD-Li antibodies and/or anti-PD-L2 antibodies of the invention antibodies.
HCV-specific T and B cell responses are monitored at monthly intervals after immunization
for a period of I year.

[0277]          Markers examined on HCV-tetramer positive and total T cells in this analysis
include markers of differentiation (e.g. CD45RA/RO, CD62L, CCR7, and CD27), activation
(e.g. CD25, CD69, CD38, and HLA-DR), survival/proliferation (e.g. bcl-2 and Ki67),
cytotoxic potential (e.g. granzymes and perforin), and cytokine receptors (CD122 and
CD127). An interesting correlation exists between pre-therapy levels of the chemokine IP-10
and response to PEG IFN-.gamma./ribavirin. IP-10 levels are measured to investigate a
potential correlation between negative regulatory pathways or HCV-specific T cell responses
and IP-10 levels. Expression of inhibitory receptors and ligands on PBMC are performed by
flow cytometry.
Example 9: Enhancing SIV-specific immunity in vivo by PD-i blockade
[0278]          Immune restoration potential of blockade of PD-i during chronic simian
immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection was tested in macaques. Fourteen Indian rhesus
macaques (Macaca mulatta) infected with SIV were studied. Eight macaques were used for
the early chronic phase and were infected intravenously with 200 50% tissue culture
infectious dose (TCID5 o) of SIV25 1. Six macaques were used for the late chronic phase, three
were infected with SIV251 intrarectally and three were infected with SIV239 intravenously.
All macaques, except RDb 11, were negative for Mamu B08 and Mamu B17 alleles. RDb1 1
was positive for Mamu B 17 allele.
[0279]          In vivo antibody treatment: Macaques were infused with either partially humanized
mouse anti-human PD-i antibody (clone EH12-1540) (Dorfman et al., Am. J. Surg. Pathol.
30:802-810, 2006) or a control antibody (SYNAGIS). The anti-PD-I antibody has mouse
variable heavy chain domain linked to human IgGI (mutated to reduce FcR and complement
binding) and mouse variable light chain domain linked to human        K. The clone EH12 binds to
macaque PD-I and blocks interactions between PD-I and its ligands in vitro. SYNAGIS is a
humanized mouse monoclonal antibody (IgGIK) specific to F protein of respiratory syncytial
virus. Antibodies were administered intravenously at 3 mg kg-I of body weight on days 0, 3,
7 and 10.
 [0280]         Immune responses: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from blood and
lymphocytes from rectal pinch biopsies were isolated as described previously (Velu et al., J.
Virol. 81:5819-5828, 2007). Tetramer staining, intracellular cytokine production, and
measurements of anti-SIV Env binding antibody were performed as described previously
                                                    95
10191856_1 (GHMatters) P86720.AU.4

(Amara et al, Science 292:69-74, 2001; Kannanganat et al., J. Virol. 81:8468-8476, 2007; Lai
et al., Virology 369:153-167, 2007).
[0281]          PD-1 blockade was performed during the early (10 weeks) as well as late (about 90
weeks) phases of chronic SIV infection. Nine macaques (five during the early phase and four
during the late phase) received the anti-PD-I antibody and five macaques (three during the
early phase and two during the late phase) received an isotype control antibody (Synagis,
anti-respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-specific).
[0282]          PD-1 blockade during chronic SIV infection resulted in a rapid expansion of SIV
specific CD8 T cells in the blood of all macaques. The CD8 T-cell responses to two
immunodominant epitopes, Gag CM9 (Allen et al., J. Immunol. 160:6062-6071, 1998) and
Tat SL8/TL8 (Allen et al., Nature 407:386-390, 2000), were studied using major
histocompatibility complex (MHC) I tetrameric complexes in seven of the anti-PD-1
antibody-treated and three of the control-antibody-treated macaques that expressed the Mamu
A*01 histocompatibility molecule. Most (>98%) of the Gag-CM9 tetramer-specific CD8 T
cells expressed PD-I before blockade. After PD-I blockade, the Gag-CM9 tetramer-specific
CD8 T cells expanded rapidly and peaked by 7-21 days. At the peak response, these levels
were about 2.5 to I I-fold higher than their respective levels on day 0 (P     = 0.007) and
remained elevated until 28-45 days. Similar results were observed with blockade during the
early as well as late phases of chronic SIV infection. A 3-4-fold increase in the frequency of
Gag-specific interferon (IFN)-y-positive CD8 T cells was also observed by day 14 after
blockade in the two Mamu A*01-negative animals (RTd I1 and RDb 11), demonstrating that
PD-I blockade can enhance the frequency of virus-specific CD8 T cells that are restricted by
non-Mamu A*01 alleles. Expansion of SIV-specific CD8 T cells was not observed in the
control-antibody treated macaques.
[0283]          PD-1 blockade was also associated with a significant increase in the frequency of
virus-specific CD8 T cells that were undergoing active cell division in vivo with improved
functional quality. Consistent with the rapid expansion of SIV-specific CD8 T cells, the
frequency of Gag-CM9 tetramer-specific CD8 cells that co-expressed Ki67 (marker for
proliferating cells) also increased as early as by day 7 after blockade (P= 0.01). Similarly, we
observed an increase in the frequencies of Gag-CM9 tetramer-specific CD8 T cells co
expressing perforin and granzyme B (cytolytic potential; P= 0.001 and P= 0.03, respectively),
CD28 (co-stimulation potential; P= 0.00 1), CD127 (proliferative potential; P       =  0.0003) and
CCR7 (lymph-node homing potential; 0.001). A transient 1.5 to 2-fold increase in the
                                                  96
10191856_1 (GHMatters) P86720.AU.4

frequency of tetramer-negative and Ki67-positive CD8 T cells after blockade was observed.
This could be due to expansion of CD8 T cells specific to other epitopes in Gag as well as
other proteins of SIV, and other chronic viral infections in these animals. No significant
enhancement was observed for these markers in the three control antibody-treated macaques.
[0284]          No expansion was observed for Tat-TL8-specific CD8 T cells after blockade. This
could be due to viral escape from recognition by Tat-TL8-specific CD8 T cells, as PD-I
blockade is known to result in expansion of T cells only when they simultaneously receive
signals through T-cell receptor. To test this possibility, the viral genomes present in the
plasma just before the initiation of blockade from all three Mamu A*01- positive macaques
that were infected with SIV251 and received the blocking antibody during the early phase of
infection were sequenced. Indeed, mutations in the viral genome corresponding to the Tat
TL8 epitope region were found. All these mutations either have been shown or predicted to
reduce the binding of Tat SL8/TL8 peptide to Mamu A*01 MHC molecule and result in
escape from recognition by the Tat-SL8/TL8-specific CD8 T cells". These results suggest
that in vivo blockade of PD-I may not result in expansion of T cells that are specific to
escape mutants of viral epitopes.
[0285]          PD-i blockade also resulted in expansion of Gag-CM9-specific CD8 T cells at the
colorectal mucosal tissue (gut), a preferential site of SIV/HIV replication. Expansion was not
observed for two of the seven macaques, although expansion was evident for one of them in
blood. In contrast to blood, the expansion in gut peaked much later by day 42 and ranged
from 2- to 3-fold compared with their respective day 0 levels (P                = 0.003). Similar to blood,
the Gag-CM9 tetramer-specific cells that co-expressed Ki67 (P                  = 0.01), perforin (P = 0.03),
granzyme B (P                =  0.01) and CD28 (P  = 0.01) also increased in the gut after blockade.
[0286]          More importantly, PD-i blockade also enhanced the functional quality of anti-viral
CD8 T cells and resulted in the generation of polyfunctional cells capable of co-producing
the cytokines IFN-y, tumour-necrosis factor (TNF)-a and interleukin (IL)-2. On the day of
initiation of PD-I blockade during the late chronic phase of infection, the frequency of Gag
specific IFN-y-positive cells was low and they failed to co-express TNF-a and IL-2.
However, after the blockade, the frequency of IFN-y-positive cells increased in all four PD-I
antibody-treated macaques (P                = 0.03) and they acquired the ability to co-express TNF-a and
IL-2. The expansion of IFN-y positive cells peaked by 14-21 days and the peak levels were 2
 10-fold higher than the respective day 0 levels. On day 21, about 16% of the total Gag
                                                            97
10191856_1 (GHMatters) P86720.AU.4

specific cells co-expressed all three cytokines, and about 30% co-expressed IFN-y and TNF
a. This is in contrast to <1% of the total Gag-specific cells co-expressing all three cytokines
(P= 0.01), and about 14% co-expressing IFN-y and TNF-a on day 0 (P               = 0.04). Similar
results were also observed after blockade during the early chronic phase of infection.
[0287]          To test the role of PD-I in regulating B-cell function during chronic
immunodeficiency virus infections, the B-cell responses after PD-i blockade in SIV-infected
macaques were characterized. Analysis of PD-i expression on different B-cell subsets before
PD-I blockade revealed preferential expression of PD-I by memory B cells
(CD20+CD27CD21) compared to naive B cells (CD20+CD27CD21; P < 0.001). In vivo
blockade of PD-I resulted in a 2 to 8-fold increase in the titer of SIV-specific binding
antibody by day 28 after blockade (P < 0.001). To understand this further, experiments were
carried out to the proliferation of memory B cells in SIV-infected macaques that were treated
simultaneously with anti-PD-I antibody and anti-retroviral therapy and observed a significant
increase in Ki67+ (proliferating) memory, but not naive, B cells as early as day 3. These
results demonstrate that the PD-I-PDL pathway could have a role in regulating B-cell
dysfunction during chronic SIV infection.
 [0288]         Neutralization assays revealed a two-fold increase in titers against the easily
neutralizable laboratory-adapted SIV251 and no increase in titers against hard-to-neutralize
wild-type SIV251 or SIV239. In two of the nine animals treated with anti-PD-1 antibody,
only a minimal (<2-fold) expansion of SIV-specific antibody after blockade. Notably, the
frequency of total memory B cells in these two animals was lower (- 4 0 % of total B cells)
compared with the remaining seven animals ( 6 0 - 9 0 % of total B cells) before blockade,
indicating that the level of SIV-specific memory B cells before blockade may determine the
level of expansion of SIV-specific antibody after blockade.
 [0289]         PD-i blockade resulted in significant reductions in plasma viraemia (P     = 0.03) and
also prolonged the survival of SW-infected macaques (P           = 0.00 1). In two of the five
macaques treated with anti-PD-I antibody during the early chronic phase, viral load declined
by day 10 and persisted at or below this level until day 90. In one macaque viral load
declined transiently and in the remaining two macaques increased transiently and returned to
pre-blockade levels. In contrast to the early chronic phase, all four macaques treated with the
anti-PD-I antibody during the late chronic phase showed a transient increase in viraemia by
day 7, but rapidly reduced the virus load by day 21 to levels that were below their respective
                                                      98
10191856_1 (GHMatters) P86720.AU.4

day 0 levels. However, the viral RNA levels returned to pre-blockade levels by day 43. As
expected, no significant reductions in the plasma viral loads were observed in any of the five
macaques treated with the control antibody. By 21-28 days after blockade, the viral RNA
levels in the anti-PD-I-antibody-treated animals were 2-10-fold lower than their respective
day 0 levels (P             =   0.03). By day 150 after the blockade, four of the five macaques in the
control group were killed owing to AIDS-related symptoms (for example loss of appetite,
diarrhoea, weight loss), whereas all nine animals in the anti-PD-I-antibody-treated group had
survived (P            =  0.001).
[0290]          The observed initial rise in plasma viraemia levels in all of the late phase-treated
and some of the early-phase-treated animals could be due to an increase in the frequency of
activated CD4 T cells. To determine this, the percentage of Ki67-positive total CD4 T cells
as well as the frequency of SIV Gag-specific IFN-y producing CD4 T cells (preferential
targets for virus replication") after blockade were measured. These analyses revealed a
transient increase in the percentage of Ki67-positive CD4 T cells by day 7-14 after blockade
(P   =  0.002) and this increase was higher in animals treated during the late phase than early
phase of infection (P               =  0.015). Similarly, an increase in the frequency of Gag-specific CD4 T
cells was also observed, but only in animals treated during the late phase of infection. No
significant increases were observed for these activated CD4 T cells in the control-antibody
treated macaques. These results suggest that the activated CD4 T cells could have contributed
to the observed initial rise in plasma viraemia levels after blockade.
[0291]          Before initiation of PD-I blockade, the set point viral load in plasma and total CD4
T cells in blood and gut were similar between the anti-PD-I-antibody-treated and control
antibody treated groups. However, the frequencies of Gag CM9+ cells and Gag CM9+ cells
co-expressing perforin, granzyme B or CD28 were not similar between the two treatment
groups before in vivo blockade. This raises the possibility that these differences could have
contributed to the expansion of Gag CM9+ cells after PD-I blockade. To study the influence
of the frequency of Gag CM9+ cells before blockade on their expansion after blockade, the
anti-PD-I-antibody-treated group into was divided into two subgroups based on the
frequency of Gag CM9+ cells before initiation of blockade such that one group has similar
levels and the other group has higher levels of Gag CM9+ cells compared with the control
antibody-treated group. These subgroups were then analyzed for expansion of Gag CM9+
cells after blockade. Expansion of Gag CM9+ cells was evident in both subgroups of animals
after blockade of PD-1, irrespective of whether they were at low or high levels before
                                                              99
10191856_1 (GHMatters) P86720.AU.4

blockade. Similar results were also observed with subgroup analyses based on the frequency
of Gag CM9+ cells co-expressing molecules associated with better T-cell function such as
perforin, granzyme B, CCR7, CD 127 or CD28. However, a trend towards better expansion
of Gag CM9+CD28+ cells in animals with higher levels of Gag CM9+CD28+ cells before
blockade was observed, suggesting that CD28 expression may serve as a biomarker for
predicting the outcome of in vivo PD-1 blockade.
[0292]          The experiments described above demonstrate that PD-1 blockade using an
antibody to PD-1 results in rapid expansion of virus-specific CD8 T cells with improved
functional quality. This enhanced T-cell immunity was seen in the blood and also in the gut, a
major reservoir of SIV infection. PD-I blockade also resulted in proliferation of memory B
cells and increases in SIV envelope-specific antibody. These improved immune responses
were associated with significant reductions in plasma viral load and also prolonged the
survival of SIV-infected macaques. Blockade was effective during the early (week 10) as
well as late (~week 90) phases of chronic infection even under conditions of severe
lymphopenia. These results demonstrate enhancement of both cellular and humoral immune
responses during a pathogenic immunodeficiency virus infection by blocking a single
inhibitory pathway and identify a novel therapeutic approach for control of human
immunodeficiency virus infections.

sequence of SEQ ID NO:32. The humanized anti-PD-Li antibody has the heavy chain
variable region sequence of SEQ ID NO:35, and the light chain variable region sequence of
SEQ ID NO:42. The heavy chain constant region of the humanized antibodies is from human
IgG4 with Ser 228 to Pro mutation (from CPSCP to CPPCP) so that the antibody forms
dimers, and the light chain constant region is human kappa light chain constant region. The
amino acid numbering for Ser 228 is according to the EU numbering system. See Aalberse et
al., Immunology 105:9-19, 2002. PBMC obtained from SIV-infected macaques (between 3

months to 1.5 years after infection) were stained with carboxyfluorescein diacetate
succinimidyl ester (CFSE) and stimulated either with SIV Gag peptide pool or culture
medium for 6 days in the presence or absence of a blocking antibody. At the end of
stimulation, cells were stained for surface CD3 and CD8, and intracellular Ki-67. Cells were
then aquired on a FACS Calibur and analyzed using Flowjo software. Lymphocytes were
identified based on the scatter, then CD8 T cells (CD3+, CD8+) were analyzed for co
staining for Ki-67 and CFSE. Ki-67+, CFSE low cells were identified as proliferating cells.
[0294]          As shown in Figure 14A, in vitro blockade of PD-i:PD-i ligand pathway using the
anti-PD-I Ab results in a significant increase in proliferation of SIV-specific CD8 T cells
responses. In vitro blockade using the anti-PD-LI Ab results in a modest increase in
proliferation of SIV-specific CD8 T cells responses (Figure 14B).
Example 11: Restoration of HCV-specific T cell proliferation by intrahepatic mononuclear
cells from a persistently infected chimpanzee
[0295]          CFSE-labeled intrahepatic lymphocytes (2x10 6) were isolated from chimpanzee
 1564 that had been chronically infected with the genotype Ia H77 strain of HCV for more
than 10 years. The intrahepatic lymphocytes were co-cultured for 6 days with 4xi0 6
irradiated autologous CD8-depleted PBMC that were either unmanipulated or pulsed with
overlapping peptides spanning the entire HCV polyprotein (genotype Ia H77 strain). Cells
were cultured in RPMI media supplemented with L-glutamine and 10% FCS, with and
without an anti-PD-LI blocking antibody (10 [g/ml, added at day 0 and day 2). The
humanized anti-PD-Li antibody has the heavy chain variable region sequence of SEQ ID
NO:35, and the light chain variable region sequence of SEQ ID NO:42. The heavy chain
constant region of the humanized antibodies is from human IgG4 with Ser 228 to Pro
mutation (from CPSCP to CPPCP) so that the antibody forms dimers, and the light chain
constant region is human kappa light chain constant region. The amino acid numbering for
Ser 228 is according to the EU numbering system. See Aalberse et al., Immunology 105:9
 19, 2002. On day 6, cells were stained with CD8-PerCP, A0701/P7(758)-PE tetramer, PD-1
Alexa 647, CD4-Alexa 700, CD14-Alexa 700, CDI6-Alexa 700, CDI9-Alexa 700, and
Live/Dead Blue. Samples were acquired on a BD LSR II flow cytometer, and data was
analyzed using FlowJo software.
 [0296]         As shown in Figure 15, the anti-PD-Li antibody treatment restored HCV-specific T
cell proliferation by intrahepatic mononuclear cells from a persistently infected chimpanzee.
