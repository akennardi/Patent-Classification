                                         ABSTRACT
Systems and processes are disclosed for controlling television user interactions using a
virtual assistant. A virtual assistant can interact with a television set-top box to control
content shown on a television. Speech input for the virtual assistant can be received from
a device with a microphone. User intent can be determined from the speech input, and the
virtual assistant can execute tasks according to the user's intent, including causing
playback of media on the television. Virtual assistant interactions can be shown on the
television in interfaces that expand or contract to occupy a minimal amount of space
while conveying desired information. Multiple devices associated with multiple displays
can be used to determine user intent from speech input as well as to convey information
to users. In some examples, virtual assistant query suggestions can be provided to the
user based on media content shown on a display.

                                            FIELD
[0003]      This relates generally to controlling television user interactions and, more
specifically, to processing speech for a virtual assistant to control television user
interactions.
                                      BACKGROUND
[0004]      Intelligent automated assistants (or virtual assistants) provide an intuitive
interface between users and electronic devices. These assistants can allow users to
interact with devices or systems using natural language in spoken and/or text forms. For
example, a user can access the services of an electronic device by providing a spoken
user input in natural language form to a virtual assistant associated with the electronic
device. The virtual assistant can perform natural language processing on the spoken user
input to infer the user's intent and operationalize the user's intent into tasks. The tasks
                                               1

1002065387
can then be performed by executing one or more functions of the electronic device, and,
in some examples, a relevant output can be returned to the user in natural language form.
[0005]     While mobile telephones (e.g., smartphones), tablet computers, and the like
                                           1A

WO 2016/003509                                                              PCT/US2015/023089
have benefitted from virtual assistant control, many other user devices lack such
convenient control mechanisms. For example, user interactions with media control
devices (e.g., televisions, television set-top boxes, cable boxes, gaming devices,
streaming media devices, digital video recorders, etc.) can be complicated and difficult to
learn. Moreover, with the growing sources of media available through such devices (e.g.,
over-the-air TV, subscription TV service, streaming video services, cable on-demand
video services, web-based video services, etc.), it can be cumbersome or even
overwhelming for some users to find desired media content to consume. As a result,
many media control devices can provide an inferior user experience that can be
frustrating for many users.
                                          SUMMARY
[0006]       Systems and processes are disclosed for controlling television interactions
using a virtual assistant. In one example, speech input can be received from a user.
Media content can be determined based on the speech input. A first user interface having
a first size can be displayed, and the first user interface can include selectable links to the
media content. A selection of one of the selectable links can be received. In response to
the selection, a second user interface can be displayed having a second size larger than
the first size, and the second user interface can include the media content associated with
the selection.
[0007]       In another example, speech input can be received from a user at a first device
having a first display. A user intent of the speech input can be determined based on
content displayed on the first display. Media content can be determined based on the user
intent. The media content can be played on a second device associated with a second
display.
[0008]       In another example, speech input can be received from a user, and the speech
input can include a query associated with content shown on a television display. A user
intent of the query can be determined based on the content shown on the television
display and/or a viewing history of media content. A result of the query can be displayed
based on the determined user intent.

[0009]      In another example, media content can be displayed on a display. An input
can be received from a user. Virtual assistant queries can be determined based on the
media content and/or a viewing history of media content. The virtual assistant queries
can be displayed on the display.

WO 2016/003509                                                             PCT/US2015/023089
                                 DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0047]      In the following description of examples, reference is made to the
accompanying drawings in which it is shown by way of illustration specific examples
that can be practiced. It is to be understood that other examples can be used and
structural changes can be made without departing from the scope of the various
examples.
[0048]      This relates to systems and processes for controlling television user
interactions using a virtual assistant. In one example, a virtual assistant can be used to
interact with a media control device, such as a television set-top box controlling content
shown on a television display. A mobile user device or a remote control with a
microphone can be used to receive speech input for the virtual assistant. The user's intent
can be determined from the speech input, and the virtual assistant can execute tasks
according to the user's intent, including causing playback of media on a connected
television and controlling any other functions of a television set-top box or like device
(e.g., managing video recordings, searching for media content, navigating menus, etc.).
[0049]      Virtual assistant interactions can be shown on a connected television or other
display. In one example, media content can be determined based on speech input
received from a user. A first user interface with a first small size can be displayed,
including selectable links to the determined media content. After receiving a selection of
a media link, a second user interface with a second larger size can be displayed, including
the media content associated with the selection. In other examples, the interface used to
convey virtual assistant interactions can expand or contract to occupy a minimal amount
of space while conveying desired information.
[0050]      In some examples, multiple devices associated with multiple displays can be
used to determine user intent from speech input as well as to convey information to users
in different ways. For example, speech input can be received from a user at a first device
having a first display. The user's intent can be determined from the speech input based
on content displayed on the first display. Media content can be determined based on the
user intent, and the media content can be played on a second device associated with a
second display.
                                               6

WO 2016/003509                                                               PCT/US2015/023089
[0051]       Television display content can also be used as contextual input for
determining user intent from speech input. For example, speech input can be received
from a user, including a query associated with content shown on a television display.
The user intent of the query can be determined based on the content shown on the
television display as well as a viewing history of media content on the television display
(e.g., disambiguating the query based on characters in a playing TV show). The results
of the query can then be displayed based on the determined user intent.
[0052]       In some examples, virtual assistant query suggestions can be provided to the
user (e.g., to acquaint the user with available commands, suggest interesting content,
etc.). For example, media content can be shown on a display, and an input can be
received from the user requesting virtual assistant query suggestions. Virtual assistant
queries suggestions can be determined based on the media content shown on the display
and a viewing history of media content shown on the display (e.g., suggesting queries
related to a playing TV show). The suggested virtual assistant queries can then be shown
on the display.
[0053]       Controlling television user interactions using a virtual assistant according to
the various examples discussed herein can provide an efficient and enjoyable user
experience. User interactions with media control devices can be intuitive and simple
using a virtual assistant capable of receiving natural language queries or commands.
Available functions can be suggested to users as desired, including meaningful query
suggestions based on playing content, which can aid users to learn control capabilities. In
addition, available media can be made easily accessible using intuitive spoken
commands. It should be understood, however, that still many other advantages can be
achieved according to the various examples discussed herein.
[0054]       FIG. 1 illustrates exemplary system 100 for controlling television user
interaction using a virtual assistant. It should be understood that controlling television
user interaction as discussed herein is merely one example of controlling media on one
type of display technology and is used for reference, and the concepts discussed herein
can be used for controlling any media content interactions generally, including on any of
a variety of devices and associated displays (e.g., monitors, laptop displays, desktop
                                               7

WO 2016/003509                                                              PCT/US2015/023089
computer displays, mobile user device displays, projector displays, etc.). The term
"television" can thus refer to any type of display associated with any of a variety of
devices. Moreover, the terms "virtual assistant," "digital assistant," "intelligent
automated assistant," or "automatic digital assistant" can refer to any information
processing system that can interpret natural language input in spoken and/or textual form
to infer user intent, and perform actions based on the inferred user intent. For example,
to act on an inferred user intent, the system can perform one or more of the following:
identifying a task flow with steps and parameters designed to accomplish the inferred
user intent; inputting specific requirements from the inferred user intent into the task
flow; executing the task flow by invoking programs, methods, services, APIs, or the like;
and generating output responses to the user in an audible (e.g., spoken) and/or visual
form.
[0055]      A virtual assistant can be capable of accepting a user request at least partially
in the form of a natural language command, request, statement, narrative, and/or inquiry.
Typically, the user request seeks either an informational answer or performance of a task
by the virtual assistant (e.g., causing display of particular media). A satisfactory response
to the user request can include provision of the requested informational answer,
performance of the requested task, or a combination of the two. For example, a user can
ask the virtual assistant a question, such as "Where am I right now?" Based on the user's
current location, the virtual assistant can answer, "You are in Central Park." The user can
also request the performance of a task, for example, "Please remind me to call Mom at 4
p.m. today." In response, the virtual assistant can acknowledge the request and then
create an appropriate reminder item in the user's electronic schedule. During the
performance of a requested task, the virtual assistant can sometimes interact with the user
in a continuous dialogue involving multiple exchanges of information over an extended
period of time. There are numerous other ways of interacting with a virtual assistant to
request information or performance of various tasks. In addition to providing verbal
responses and taking programmed actions, the virtual assistant can also provide responses
in other visual or audio forms (e.g., as text, alerts, music, videos, animations, etc.).
Moreover, as discussed herein, an exemplary virtual assistant can control playback of
media content (e.g., playing video on a television) and cause information to be displayed
                                                8

[0056]      An example of a virtual assistant is described in Applicants' U.S. Utility
Application Serial No. 12/987,982 for "Intelligent Automated Assistant," filed January
10, 2011, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.
[0057]      As shown in FIG. 1, in some examples, a virtual assistant can be implemented
according to a client-server model. The virtual assistant can include a client-side portion
executed on a user device 102 and a server-side portion executed on a server system 110.
The client-side portion can also be executed on television set-top box 104 in conjunction
with remote control 106. User device 102 can include any electronic device, such as a
mobile phone (e.g., smartphone), tablet computer, portable media player, desktop
computer, laptop computer, PDA, wearable electronic device (e.g., digital glasses,
wristband, wristwatch, brooch, armband, etc.), or the like. Television set-top box 104 can
include any media control device, such as a cable box, satellite box, video player, video
streaming device, digital video recorder, gaming system, DVD player, Blu-ray DiscTM
Player, a combination of such devices, or the like. Television set-top box 104 can be
connected to display 112 and speakers 111 via a wired or wireless connection. Display
112 (with or without speakers 111) can be any type of display, such as a television
display, monitor, projector, or the like. In some examples, television set-top box 104 can
connect to an audio system (e.g., audio receiver), and speakers 111 can be separate from
display 112. In other examples, display 112, speakers 111, and television set-top box 104
can be incorporated together in a single device, such as a smart television with advanced
processing and network connectivity capabilities. In such examples, the functions of
television set-top box 104 can be executed as an application on the combined device.
[0058]      In some examples, television set-top box 104 can function as a media control
center for multiple types and sources of media content. For example, television set-top
box 104 can facilitate user access to live television (e.g., over-the-air, satellite, or cable
television). As such, television set-top box 104 can include cable tuners, satellite tuners,
or the like. In some examples, television set-top box 104 can also record television
programs for later time-shifted viewing. In other examples, television set-top box 104
can provide access to one or more streaming media services, such as cable-delivered on
                                               9

WO 2016/003509                                                             PCT/US2015/023089
demand television shows, videos, and music as well as Internet-delivered television
shows, videos, and music (e.g., from various free, paid, and subscription-based streaming
services). In still other examples, television set-top box 104 can facilitate playback or
display of media content from any other source, such as displaying photos from a mobile
user device, playing videos from a coupled storage device, playing music from a coupled
music player, or the like. Television set-top box 104 can also include various other
combinations of the media control features discussed herein, as desired.
[0059]       User device 102 and television set-top box 104 can communicate with server
system 110 through one or more networks 108, which can include the Internet, an
intranet, or any other wired or wireless public or private network. In addition, user
device 102 can communicate with television set-top box 104 through network 108 or
directly through any other wired or wireless communication mechanisms (e.g., Bluetooth,
Wi-Fi, radio frequency, infrared transmission, etc.). As illustrated, remote control 106
can communicate with television set-top box 104 using any type of communication, such
as a wired connection or any type of wireless communication (e.g., Bluetooth, Wi-Fi,
radio frequency, infrared transmission, etc.), including via network 108. In some
examples, users can interact with television set-top box 104 through user device 102,
remote control 106, or interface elements integrated within television set-top box 104
(e.g., buttons, a microphone, a camera, a joystick, etc.). For example, speech input
including media-related queries or commands for the virtual assistant can be received at
user device 102 and/or remote control 106, and the speech input can be used to cause
media-related tasks to be executed on television set-top box 104. Likewise, tactile
commands for controlling media on television set-top box 104 can be received at user
device 102 and/or remote control 106 (as well as from other devices not shown). The
various functions of television set-top box 104 can thus be controlled in a variety of
ways, giving users multiple options for controlling media content from multiple devices.
[0060]       The client-side portion of the exemplary virtual assistant executed on user
device 102 and/or television set-top box 104 with remote control 106 can provide client
side functionalities, such as user-facing input and output processing and communications
with server system 110. Server system 110 can provide server-side functionalities for
any number of clients residing on a respective user device 102 or respective television
                                               10

WO 2016/003509                                                              PCT/US2015/023089
set-top box 104.
[0061]      Server system 110 can include one or more virtual assistant servers 114 that
can include a client-facing 1/0 interface 122, one or more processing modules 118, data
and model storage 120, and an 1/0 interface to external services 116. The client-facing
1/0 interface 122 can facilitate the client-facing input and output processing for virtual
assistant server 114. The one or more processing modules 118 can utilize data and model
storage 120 to determine the user's intent based on natural language input, and can
perform task execution based on inferred user intent. In some examples, virtual assistant
server 114 can communicate with external services 124, such as telephony services,
calendar services, information services, messaging services, navigation services,
television programming services, streaming media services, and the like, through
network(s) 108 for task completion or information acquisition. The 1/0 interface to
external services 116 can facilitate such communications.
[0062]      Server system 110 can be implemented on one or more standalone data
processing devices or a distributed network of computers. In some examples, server
system 110 can employ various virtual devices and/or services of third-party service
providers (e.g., third-party cloud service providers) to provide the underlying computing
resources and/or infrastructure resources of server system 110.
[0063]      Although the functionality of the virtual assistant is shown in FIG. 1 as
including both a client-side portion and a server-side portion, in some examples, the
functions of an assistant (or speech recognition and media control in general) can be
implemented as a standalone application installed on a user device, television set-top box,
smart television, or the like. In addition, the division of functionalities between the client
and server portions of the virtual assistant can vary in different examples. For instance,
in some examples, the client executed on user device 102 or television set-top box 104
can be a thin client that provides only user-facing input and output processing functions,
and delegates all other functionalities of the virtual assistant to a backend server.
[0064]      FIG. 2 illustrates a block diagram of exemplary user device 102 according to
various examples. As shown, user device 102 can include a memory interface 202, one
or more processors 204, and a peripherals interface 206. The various components in user

device 102 can be coupled together by one or more communication buses or signal lines.
User device 102 can further include various sensors, subsystems, and peripheral devices
that are coupled to the peripherals interface 206. The sensors, subsystems, and peripheral
devices can gather information and/or facilitate various functionalities of user device 102.
[0065]       For example, user device 102 can include a motion sensor 210, a light sensor
212, and a proximity sensor 214 coupled to peripherals interface 206 to facilitate
orientation, light, and proximity sensing functions. One or more other sensors 216, such
as a positioning system (e.g., a GPS receiver), a temperature sensor, a biometric sensor, a
gyroscope, a compass, an accelerometer, and the like, can also be connected to
peripherals interface 206, to facilitate related functionalities.
[0066]       In some examples, a camera subsystem 220 and an optical sensor 222 can be
utilized to facilitate camera functions, such as taking photographs and recording video
clips. Communication functions can be facilitated through one or more wired and/or
wireless communication subsystems 224, which can include various communication
ports, radio frequency receivers and transmitters, and/or optical (e.g., infrared) receivers
and transmitters. An audio subsystem 226 can be coupled to speakers 228 and
microphone 230 to facilitate voice-enabled functions, such as voice recognition, voice
replication, digital recording, and telephony functions.
[0067]       In some examples, user device 102 can further include an I/O subsystem 240
coupled to peripherals interface 206. 1/0 subsystem 240 can include a touchscreen
controller 242 and/or other input controller(s) 244. Touchscreen controller 242 can be
coupled to a touchscreen 246. Touchscreen 246 and the touchscreen controller 242 can,
for example, detect contact and movement or break thereof using any of a plurality of
touch sensitivity technologies, such as capacitive, resistive, infrared, and surface acoustic
wave technologies; proximity sensor arrays; and the like. Other input controller(s) 244
can be coupled to other input/control devices 248, such as one or more buttons, rocker
switches, a thumb-wheel, an infrared port, a USB port, and/or a pointer device, such as a
stylus.
[0068]       In some examples, user device 102 can further include a memory interface
202 coupled to memory 250. Memory 250 can include any electronic, magnetic, optical,
                                               12

(magnetic); a portable optical disc such as CD, CD-R, CD-RW, DVD, DVD-R, or DVD
RW; or flash memory such as compact flash cards, secured digital cards, USB memory
devices, memory sticks, and the like. In some examples, a non-transitory computer
readable storage medium of memory 250 can be used to store instructions (e.g., for
performing portions or all of the various processes described herein) for use by or in
connection with an instruction execution system, apparatus, or device, such as a
computer-based system, processor-containing system, or other system that can fetch the
instructions from the instruction execution system, apparatus, or device, and can execute
the instructions. In other examples, the instructions (e.g., for performing portions or all
of the various processes described herein) can be stored on a non-transitory computer
readable storage medium of server system 110, or can be divided between the non
transitory computer-readable storage medium of memory 250 and the non-transitory
computer-readable storage medium of server system 110. In the context of this
document, a "non-transitory computer-readable storage medium" can be any medium that
can contain or store the program for use by or in connection with the instruction
execution system, apparatus, or device.
[0069]      In some examples, memory 250 can store an operating system 252, a
communication module 254, a graphical user interface module 256, a sensor processing
module 258, a phone module 260, and applications 262. Operating system 252 can
include instructions for handling basic system services and for performing hardware
dependent tasks. Communication module 254 can facilitate communicating with one or
more additional devices, one or more computers, and/or one or more servers. Graphical
user interface module 256 can facilitate graphical user interface processing. Sensor
processing module 258 can facilitate sensor-related processing and functions. Phone

[0070]      As described herein, memory 250 can also store client-side virtual assistant
instructions (e.g., in a virtual assistant client module 264) and various user data 266 (e.g.,
user-specific vocabulary data, preference data, and/or other data such as the user's
electronic address book, to-do lists, shopping lists, television program favorites, etc.) to,
for example, provide the client-side functionalities of the virtual assistant. User data 266
can also be used in performing speech recognition in support of the virtual assistant or for
any other application.
[0071]      In various examples, virtual assistant client module 264 can be capable of
accepting voice input (e.g., speech input), text input, touch input, and/or gestural input
through various user interfaces (e.g., 1/0 subsystem 240, audio subsystem 226, or the
like) of user device 102. Virtual assistant client module 264 can also be capable of
providing output in audio (e.g., speech output), visual, and/or tactile forms. For example,
output can be provided as voice, sound, alerts, text messages, menus, graphics, videos,
animations, vibrations, and/or combinations of two or more of the above. During
operation, virtual assistant client module 264 can communicate with the virtual assistant
server using communication subsystem 224.
[0072]      In some examples, virtual assistant client module 264 can utilize the various
sensors, subsystems, and peripheral devices to gather additional information from the
surrounding environment of user device 102 to establish a context associated with a user,
the current user interaction, and/or the current user input. Such context can also include
information from other devices, such as from television set-top box 104. In some
examples, virtual assistant client module 264 can provide the contextual information or a
subset thereof with the user input to the virtual assistant server to help infer the user's
intent. The virtual assistant can also use the contextual information to determine how to
prepare and deliver outputs to the user. The contextual information can further be used
by user device 102 or server system 110 to support accurate speech recognition.
[0073]      In some examples, the contextual information that accompanies the user input
can include sensor information, such as lighting, ambient noise, ambient temperature,
images or videos of the surrounding environment, distance to another object, and the like.
The contextual information can further include information associated with the physical

state of user device 102 (e.g., device orientation, device location, device temperature,
power level, speed, acceleration, motion patterns, cellular signal strength, etc.) or the
software state of user device 102 (e.g., running processes, installed programs, past and
present network activities, background services, error logs, resources usage, etc.). The
contextual information can further include information associated with the state of
connected devices or other devices associated with the user (e.g., media content displayed
by television set-top box 104, media content available to television set-top box 104, etc.).
Any of these types of contextual information can be provided to virtual assistant server
114 (or used on user device 102 itself) as contextual information associated with a user
input.
[0074]       In some examples, virtual assistant client module 264 can selectively provide
information (e.g., user data 266) stored on user device 102 in response to requests from
virtual assistant server 114 (or it can be used on user device 102 itself in executing speech
recognition and/or virtual assistant functions). Virtual assistant client module 264 can
also elicit additional input from the user via a natural language dialogue or other user
interfaces upon request by virtual assistant server 114. Virtual assistant client module
264 can pass the additional input to virtual assistant server 114 to help virtual assistant
server 114 in intent inference and/or fulfillment of the user's intent expressed in the user
request.
[0075]       In various examples, memory 250 can include additional instructions or fewer
instructions. Furthermore, various functions of user device 102 can be implemented in
hardware and/or in firmware, including in one or more signal processing and/or
application specific integrated circuits.

system 300 for controlling television user interaction. System 300 can include a subset of
the elements of system 100. In some examples, system 300 can execute certain functions
alone and can function together with other elements of system 100 to execute other
functions. For example, the elements of system 300 can process certain media control
functions without interacting with server system 110 (e.g., playback of locally stored
media, recording functions, channel tuning, etc.), and system 300 can process other
                                               15

media control functions in conjunction with server system 110 and other elements of
system 100 (e.g., playback of remotely stored media, downloading media content,
processing certain virtual assistant queries, etc.). In other examples, the elements of
system 300 can perform the functions of the larger system 100, including accessing
external services 124 through a network. It should be understood that functions can be
divided between local devices and remote server devices in a variety of other ways.

various functionalities of television set-top box 104.
[0078]      For example, television set-top box 104 can include a communications
subsystem 324. Communication functions can be facilitated through one or more wired
and/or wireless communication subsystems 324, which can include various
communication ports, radio frequency receivers and transmitters, and/or optical (e.g.,
infrared) receivers and transmitters.
[0079]      In some examples, television set-top box 104 can further include an 1/0
subsystem 340 coupled to peripherals interface 306. 1/0 subsystem 340 can include an
audio/video output controller 370. Audio/video output controller 370 can be coupled to a
display 112 and speakers 111 or can otherwise provide audio and video output (e.g., via
audio/video ports, wireless transmission, etc.). 1/0 subsystem 340 can further include
remote controller 342. Remote controller 342 can be communicatively coupled to remote
control 106 (e.g., via a wired connection, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, etc.). Remote control 106
can include microphone 372 for capturing audio input (e.g., speech input from a user),
button(s) 374 for capturing tactile input, and transceiver 376 for facilitating
communication with television set-top box 104 via remote controller 342. Remote
control 106 can also include other input mechanisms, such as a keyboard, joystick,
touchpad, or the like. Remote control 106 can further include output mechanisms, such
                                               16

as lights, a display, a speaker, or the like. Input received at remote control 106 (e.g., user
speech, button presses, etc.) can be communicated to television set-top box 104 via
remote controller 342. I/O subsystem 340 can also include other input controller(s) 344.
Other input controller(s) 344 can be coupled to other input/control devices 348, such as
one or more buttons, rocker switches, a thumb-wheel, an infrared port, a USB port,
and/or a pointer device, such as a stylus.
[0080]       In some examples, television set-top box 104 can further include a memory
interface 302 coupled to memory 350. Memory 350 can include any electronic,
magnetic, optical, electromagnetic, infrared, or semiconductor system, apparatus, or
device; a portable computer diskette (magnetic); a random access memory (RAM)
(magnetic); a read-only memory (ROM) (magnetic); an erasable programmable read-only
memory (EPROM) (magnetic); a portable optical disc such as CD, CD-R, CD-RW,
DVD, DVD-R, or DVD-RW; or flash memory such as compact flash cards, secured
digital cards, USB memory devices, memory sticks, and the like. In some examples, a
non-transitory computer-readable storage medium of memory 350 can be used to store
instructions (e.g., for performing portions or all of the various processes described herein)
for use by or in connection with an instruction execution system, apparatus, or device,
such as a computer-based system, processor-containing system, or other system that can
fetch the instructions from the instruction execution system, apparatus, or device, and can
execute the instructions. In other examples, the instructions (e.g., for performing portions
or all of the various processes described herein) can be stored on a non-transitory
computer-readable storage medium of server system 110, or can be divided between the
non-transitory computer-readable storage medium of memory 350 and the non-transitory
computer-readable storage medium of server system 110. In the context of this
document, a "non-transitory computer-readable storage medium" can be any medium that
can contain or store the program for use by or in connection with the instruction
execution system, apparatus, or device.

Graphical user interface module 356 can facilitate graphical user interface processing.
On-device media module 358 can facilitate storage and playback of media content stored
locally on television set-top box 104 and other media content available locally (e.g., cable
channel tuning). Off-device media module 360 can facilitate streaming playback or
download of media content stored remotely (e.g., on a remote server, on user device 102,
etc.). Application module 362 can facilitate various functionalities of user applications,
such as electronic messaging, web browsing, media processing, gaming, and/or other
processes and functions.
[0082]       As described herein, memory 350 can also store client-side virtual assistant
instructions (e.g., in a virtual assistant client module 364) and various user data 366 (e.g.,
user-specific vocabulary data, preference data, and/or other data such as the user's
electronic address book, to-do lists, shopping lists, television program favorites, etc.) to,
for example, provide the client-side functionalities of the virtual assistant. User data 366

like. Speech input interface 484 can be configured to occupy a minimal amount of space
so as not to significantly interfere with user viewing of video 480.
[0091]       In one example, a virtual assistant can be triggered to listen for speech input
containing a command or query (or to commence recording of speech input for
subsequent processing or commence processing in real-time of speech input). Listening
can be triggered in a variety of ways, including indications such as a user pressing a
physical button on remote control 106, a user pressing a physical button on user device
102, a user pressing a virtual button on user device 102, a user uttering a trigger phrase
that is recognizable by an always-listening device (e.g., uttering "Hey Assistant" to
commence listening for a command), a user performing a gesture detectable by a sensor
(e.g., motioning in front of a camera), or the like. In another example, a user can press
and hold a physical button on remote control 106 or user device 102 to initiate listening.
In still other examples, a user can press and hold a physical button on remote control 106

symbol to convey that the system (e.g., one or more elements of system 100) is ready to
capture speech input from the user.
[0093]      As the user begins to speak, listening confirmation 487 shown in FIG. 4C can
be displayed to confirm that the system is capturing the speech input. In some examples,
listening confirmation 487 can be displayed in response to receiving speech input (e.g.,
capturing speech). In other examples, readiness confirmation 486 can be displayed for a
predetermined amount of time (e.g., 500 milliseconds, 1 second, 3 seconds, etc.) after
which listening confirmation 487 can be displayed. Listening confirmation 487 can
include a waveform symbol as shown, or can include an active waveform animation that
moves (e.g., changes frequency) in response to user speech. In other examples, listening
confirmation 487 can include any other image, icon, animation, or symbol to convey that
the system is capturing speech input from the user.
[0094]      Upon detecting that the user has finished speaking (e.g., based on a pause,
speech interpretation indicating the end of a query, or any other endpoint detection
method), processing confirmation 488 shown in FIG. 4D can be displayed to confirm that
the system finished capturing the speech input and is processing the speech input (e.g.,
                                              21

WO 2016/003509                                                               PCT/US2015/023089
interpreting the speech input, determining user intent, and/or executing the associated
tasks). Processing confirmation 488 can include an hourglass symbol as shown, or can
include any other image, icon, animation, or symbol to convey that the system is
processing the captured speech input. In another example, processing confirmation 488
can include an animation of a spinning circle or a colored/glowing point moving around a
circle.
[0095]       After the captured speech input is interpreted as text (or in response to
successfully converting the speech input to text), command receipt confirmation 490
and/or transcription 492 shown in FIG. 4E can be displayed to confirm that the system
received and interpreted the speech input. Transcription 492 can include a transcription
of the received speech input (e.g., "What sporting events are on right now?"). In some
examples, transcription 492 can be animated to slide up from the bottom of display 112,
can be displayed momentarily in the position shown in FIG. 4E (e.g., a few seconds), and
can then be slid up to the top of speech input interface 484 before disappearing from view
(e.g., as though the text is scrolled up and eventually out of view). In other examples, a
transcription may not be displayed, and the user's command or query can be processed
and associated tasks can be executed without displaying a transcription (e.g., a simple
channel change can be executed immediately without displaying a transcription of the
user's speech).
[0096]       In other examples, speech transcription can be performed in real-time as a
user speaks. As words are transcribed, they can be displayed in speech input interface
484. For example, the words can be displayed alongside listening confirmation 487.
After the user finishes speaking, command receipt confirmation 490 can be displayed
briefly before executing the tasks associated with the user's command.
[0097]       Moreover, in other examples, command receipt confirmation 490 can convey
information about received and understood commands. For example, for a simple request
to change to another channel, a logo or number associated with the channel can briefly be
displayed as command receipt confirmation 490 (e.g., for a few seconds) as the channel is
changed. In another example, for a request to pause a video (e.g., video 480), a pause
symbol (e.g., two vertical, parallel bars) can be displayed as command receipt
                                              22

WO 2016/003509                                                              PCT/US2015/023089
confirmation 490. The pause symbol can remain on the display until, for example, the
user performs another action (e.g., issuing a play command to resume playback).
Symbols, logos, animations, or the like can likewise be displayed for any other command
(e.g., symbols for rewind, fast forward, stop, play, etc.). Command receipt confirmation
490 can thus be used to convey command-specific information.
[0098]      In some examples, speech input interface 484 can be hidden after receipt of a
user query or command. For example, speech input interface 484 can be animated as
sliding downward until it is out of view of the bottom of display 112. Speech input
interface 484 can be hidden in instances where further information need not be displayed
to the user. For example, for common or straightforward commands (e.g., change to
channel ten, change to the sports channel, play, pause, fast forward, rewind, etc.), speech
input interface 484 can be hidden immediately after confirming command receipt, and the
associated task or tasks can be performed immediately. Although various examples
herein illustrate and describe an interface at a bottom or top edge of a display, it should
be appreciated that any of the various interfaces can be positioned in other locations
around a display. For example, speech input interface 484 can emerge from a side edge
of display 112, in the center of display 112, in a corner of display 112, or the like.
Similarly, the various other interface examples described herein can be arranged in a
variety of different orientations in a variety of different locations on a display. Moreover,
although various interfaces described herein are illustrated as opaque, any of the various
interfaces can be transparent or otherwise allow an image (blurred or whole) to be viewed
through the interface (e.g., overlaying interface content on media content without
completely obscuring the underlying media content).
[0099]      In other examples, the result of a query can be displayed within speech input
interface 484 or in a different interface. FIG. 5 illustrates exemplary media content
interface 510 over video 480 with an exemplary result of the transcribed query of
FIG. 4E. In some examples, the result of a virtual assistant query can include media
content instead of or in addition to textual content. For example, the result of a virtual
assistant query can include television programs, videos, music, or the like. Some results
can include media immediately available for playback, while other results can include
media that may be available for purchase or the like.
                                               23

WO 2016/003509                                                             PCT/US2015/023089
[0100]       As shown, media content interface 510 can be a larger size than speech input
interface 484. In one example, speech input interface 484 can be of a smaller first size to
accommodate speech input information, while media content interface 510 can be of a
larger second size to accommodate query results, which can include text, still images, and
moving images. In this manner, interfaces for conveying virtual assistant information can
scale in size according to the content that is to be conveyed, thereby limiting screen real
estate intrusion (e.g., minimally blocking other content, such as video 480).
[0101]       As illustrated, media content interface 510 can include (as a result of a virtual
assistant query) selectable video links 512, selectable text links 514, and additional
content link 513. In some examples, links can be selected by navigating focus, a cursor,
or the like to a particular element and selecting it using a remote control (e.g., remote
control 106). In other examples, links can be selected using voice commands to the
virtual assistant (e.g., watch that soccer game, show details about the basketball game,
etc.). Selectable video links 512 can include still or moving images and can be selectable
to cause playback of the associated video. In one example, selectable video link 512 can
include a playing video of the associated video content. In another example, selectable
video link 512 can include a live feed of a television channel. For example, selectable
video link 512 can include a live feed of a soccer game on a sports channel as a result of a
virtual assistant query about sporting events currently on television. Selectable video link
512 can also include any other video, animation, image, or the like (e.g., a triangular play
symbol). Moreover, link 512 can link to any type of media content, such as a movie,
television show, sporting event, music, or the like.
[0102]       Selectable text links 514 can include textual content associated with selectable
video links 512 or can include textual representations of results of a virtual assistant
query. In one example, selectable text links 514 can include a description of media
resulting from a virtual assistant query. For instance, selectable text link 514 can include
the name of a television program, title of a movie, description of a sporting event,
television channel name or number, or the like. In one example, selection of text link 514
can cause playback of the associated media content. In another example, selection of text
link 514 can provide additional detailed information about the media content or other
                                               24

WO 2016/003509                                                              PCT/US2015/023089
virtual assistant query result. Additional content link 513 can link to and cause display of
additional results of a virtual assistant query.
[0103]       Although certain media content examples are shown in FIG. 5, it should be
appreciated that any type of media content can be included as a result of a virtual
assistant query for media content. For example, media content that can be returned as a
result of a virtual assistant can include videos, television programs, music, television
channels, or the like. In addition, in some examples, categorical filters can be provided in
any of the interfaces herein to allow users to filter search or query results or displayed
media options. For example, selectable filters can be provided to filter results by type
(e.g., movies, music albums, books, television shows, etc.). In other examples, selectable
filters can include genre or content descriptors (e.g., comedy, interview, specific
program, etc.). In still other examples, selectable filters can include times (e.g., this
week, last week, last year, etc.). It should be appreciated that filters can be provided in
any of the various interfaces described herein to allow users to filter results based on
categories relevant to the displayed content (e.g., filter by type where media results have
various types, filter by genre where media results have various genres, filter by times
where media results have various times, etc.).
[0104]       In other examples, media content interface 510 can include a paraphrase of a
query in addition to media content results. For example, a paraphrase of the user's query
can be displayed above the media content results (above selectable video links 512 and
selectable text links 514). In the example of FIG. 5, such a paraphrase of the user's query
can include the following: "Here are some sporting events that are on right now." Other
text introducing the media content results can likewise be displayed.
[0105]       In some examples, after displaying any interface, including interface 510, a
user can initiate capture of additional speech input with a new query (that may or may not
be related to previous queries). User queries can include commands to act on interface
elements, such as a command to select a video link 512. In another example, user speech
can include a query associated with displayed content, such as displayed menu
information, a playing video (e.g., video 480), or the like. A response can be determined
for such a query based on the information shown (e.g., displayed text) and/or metadata
                                               25

WO 2016/003509                                                              PCT/US2015/023089
associated with displayed content (e.g., metadata associated with a playing video). For
example, a user can ask about a media result shown in an interface (e.g., interface 510),
and metadata associated with that media can be searched to provide an answer or result.
Such an answer or result can then be provided in another interface or within the same
interface (e.g., in any of the interfaces discussed herein).
[0106]       As noted above, in one example, additional detailed information about media
content can be displayed in response to selection of a text link 514. FIGS. 6A and 6B
illustrate exemplary media detail interface 618 over video 480 after selection of a text
link 514. In one example, in providing addition detailed information, media content
interface 510 can be expanded into media detail interface 618 as illustrated by interface
expansion transition 616 of FIG. 6A. In particular, as shown in FIG. 6A, selected content
can be expanded in size and additional textual information can be provided by expanding
the interface upward on display 112 to occupy more of the screen real estate. The
interface can be expanded to accommodate the additional detailed information desired by
the user. In this manner, the size of the interface can scale with the amount of content
desired by the user, thereby minimizing screen real estate intrusion while still conveying
the desired content.
[0107]       FIG. 6B illustrates detail interface 618 after full expansion. As shown, detail
interface 618 can be of a larger size than either media content interface 510 or speech
input interface 484 to accommodate the desired detailed information. Detail interface
618 can include detailed media information 622, which can include a variety of detailed
information associated with media content or another result of a virtual assistant query.
Detailed media information 622 can include a program title, program description,
program air time, channel, episode synopsis, movie description, actor names, character
names, sporting event participants, producer names, director names, or any other detailed
information associated with a result of a virtual assistant query.
[0108]       In one example, detail interface 618 can include selectable video link 620 (or
another link to play media content), which can include a larger version of a
corresponding selectable video link 512. As such, selectable video link 620 can include
still or moving images and can be selectable to cause playback of the associated video.
                                                26

WO 2016/003509                                                             PCT/US2015/023089
Selectable video link 620 can include a playing video of the associated video content, a
live feed of a television channel (e.g., a live feed of a soccer game on a sports channel),
or the like. Selectable video link 620 can also include any other video, animation, image,
or the like (e.g., a triangular play symbol).
[0109]       As noted above, a video can be played in response to selection of a video link,
such as video link 620 or video links 512. FIGS. 7A and 7B illustrate an exemplary
media transition interface that can be displayed in response to selection of a video link (or
other command to play video content). As illustrated, video 480 can be replaced with
video 726. In one example, video 726 can be expanded to overtake or cover video 480 as
shown by interface expansion transition 724 in FIG. 7A. The result of the transition can
include expanded media interface 728 of FIG. 7B. As with other interfaces, the size of
expanded media interface 728 can be sufficient to provide the user with the desired
information; here, that can include expanding to fill display 112. Expanded media
interface 728 can thus be larger than any other interface as the desired information can
include playing media content across the entire display. Although not shown, in some
examples, descriptive information can briefly be overlaid on video 726 (e.g., along the
bottom of the screen). Such descriptive information can include the name of the
associated program, video, channel, or the like. The descriptive information can then be
hidden from view (e.g., after a few seconds).
[0110]       FIGS. 8A and 8B illustrate exemplary speech input interface 836 that can be
shown on display 112 to convey speech input information to a user. In one example,
speech input interface 836 can be shown over menu 830. Menu 830 can include various
media options 832, and speech input interface 836 can similarly be displayed over any
other type of menu (e.g., content menus, category menus, control menus, setup menus,
program menus, etc.). In one example, speech input interface 836 can be configured to
occupy a relatively large amount of screen real estate of display 112. For example,
speech input interface 836 can be larger than speech input interface 484 discussed above.
In one example, the size of speech input interface to use (e.g., either the smaller interface
484 or the larger interface 836) can be determined based on the background content.
When the background content includes a moving image, for example, a small size speech
input interface can be displayed (e.g., interface 484). On the other hand, when the
                                               27

WO 2016/003509                                                              PCT/US2015/023089
background content includes a still image (e.g., a paused video) or a menu, for example, a
large size speech input interface can be displayed (e.g., interface 836). In this manner, if
a user is watching video content, a smaller speech input interface can be displayed that
only minimally intrudes on the screen real estate; whereas if a user is navigating a menu
or viewing a paused video or other still image, a larger speech input interface can be
displayed that can convey more information or have a more profound effect by occupying
additional real estate. Other interfaces discussed herein can likewise be sized differently
based on background content.
[0111]       As discussed above, a virtual assistant can be triggered to listen for speech
input containing a command or query (or to commence recording of speech input for
subsequent processing or commence processing in real-time of speech input). Listening
can be triggered in a variety of ways, including indications such as a user pressing a
physical button on remote control 106, a user pressing a physical button on user device
102, a user pressing a virtual button on user device 102, a user uttering a trigger phrase
that is recognizable by an always-listening device (e.g., uttering "Hey Assistant" to
commence listening for a command), a user performing a gesture detectable by a sensor
(e.g., motioning in front of a camera), or the like. In another example, a user can press
and hold a physical button on remote control 106 or user device 102 to initiate listening.
In still other examples, a user can press and hold a physical button on remote control 106
or user device 102 while speaking a query or command, and can release the button when
finished. Various other indications can likewise be received to initiate receipt of speech
input from the user.
[0112]       In response to receiving an indication to listen for speech input, speech input
interface 836 can be displayed over menu 830. FIG. 8A illustrates large notification area
834 expanding upward from the bottom portion of display 112. Speech input interface
836 can be displayed in large notification area 834 upon receipt of an indication to listen
for speech input, and the interface can be animated to slide upward from the bottom edge
of the viewing area of display 112 as shown. In some examples, a background menu,
paused video, still image, or other background content can be contracted and/or moved
backward in the z direction (as if further into display 112) as an overlapping interface is
displayed (e.g., in response to receiving an indication to listen for speech input).

WO 2016/003509                                                            PCT/US2015/023089
Background interface contraction transition 831 and the associated inward-pointing
arrows illustrate how background content (e.g., menu 830) can be contracted-shrinking
the displayed menu, images, text, etc. This can provide a visual effect of the background
content appearing to move away from the user, out of the way of a new foreground
interface (e.g., interface 836). FIG. 8B illustrates contracted background interface 833,
including a contracted (shrunken) version of menu 830. As shown, contracted
background interface 833 (which can include a border) can appear further from the user
while ceding focus to the foreground interface 836. Background content in any of the
other examples discussed herein (including background video content) can similarly be
contracted and/or moved backward in the z direction as overlapping interfaces are
displayed.
[0113]      FIG. 8B illustrates speech input interface 836 after sliding upward into view.
As discussed above, various confirmations can be displayed while receiving speech input.
Although not shown here, speech input interface 836 can similarly display larger versions
of readiness confirmation 486, listening confirmation 487, and/or processing
confirmation 488 in a similar manner as speech input interface 484 discussed above with
reference to FIGS. 4B, 4C, and 4D, respectively.
[0114]      As shown in FIG. 8B, command receipt confirmation 838 can be shown (as
with the smaller sized command receipt confirmation 490 discussed above) to confirm
that the system received and interpreted the speech input. Transcription 840 can also be
shown and can include a transcription of the received speech input (e.g., "What's the
weather in New York?"). In some examples, transcription 840 can be animated to slide
up from the bottom of display 112, can be displayed momentarily in the position shown
in FIG. 8B (e.g., a few seconds), and can then be slid up to the top of speech input
interface 836 before disappearing from view (e.g., as though the text is scrolled up and
eventually out of view). In other examples, a transcription may not be displayed, and the
user's command or query can be processed and associated tasks can be executed without
displaying a transcription.
[0115]      In other examples, speech transcription can be performed in real-time as a
user speaks. As words are transcribed, they can be displayed in speech input interface
                                              29

WO 2016/003509                                                             PCT/US2015/023089
836. For example, the words can be displayed alongside a larger version of listening
confirmation 487 discussed above. After the user finishes speaking, command receipt
confirmation 838 can be displayed briefly before executing the tasks associated with the
user's command.
[0116]       Moreover, in other examples, command receipt confirmation 838 can convey
information about received and understood commands. For example, for a simple request
to tune to a particular channel, a logo or number associated with the channel can briefly
be displayed as command receipt confirmation 838 (e.g., for a few seconds) as the
channel is tuned. In another example, for a request to select a displayed menu item (e.g.,
one of media options 832), an image associated with the selected menu item can be
displayed as command receipt confirmation 838. Command receipt confirmation 838 can
thus be used to convey command-specific information.
[0117]       In some examples, speech input interface 836 can be hidden after receipt of a
user query or command. For example, speech input interface 836 can be animated as
sliding downward until it is out of view of the bottom of display 112. Speech input
interface 836 can be hidden in instances where further information need not be displayed
to the user. For example, for common or straightforward commands (e.g., change to
channel ten, change to the sports channel, play that movie, etc.), speech input interface
836 can be hidden immediately after confirming command receipt, and the associated
task or tasks can be performed immediately.
[0118]       In other examples, the result of a query can be displayed within speech input
interface 836 or in a different interface. FIG. 9 illustrates exemplary virtual assistant
result interface 942 over menu 830 (specifically over contracted background interface
833) with an exemplary result of the transcribed query of FIG. 8B. In some examples,
the result of a virtual assistant query can include a textual answer, such as text answer
944. The result of a virtual assistant query can also include media content that addresses
a user's query, such as the content associated with selectable video link 946 and purchase
link 948. In particular, in this example, a user can ask for weather information for the
specified location of New York. The virtual assistant can provide text answer 944
directly answering the user's query (e.g., indicating that the weather looks good and
                                               30

WO 2016/003509                                                            PCT/US2015/023089
providing temperature information). Instead of or in addition to text answer 944, the
virtual assistant can provide selectable video link 946 along with purchase link 948 and
the associated text. The media associated with links 946 and 948 can also provide a
response to the user's query. Here, the media associated with links 946 and 948 can
include a ten-minute clip of weather information at the specified location-specifically,
the five-day forecast for New York from a television channel called the Weather Forecast
Channel.
[0119]      In one example, the clip addressing the user's query can include a time-cued
portion of previously-aired content (that may be available from a recording or from a
streaming service). The virtual assistant can, in one example, identify such content based
on the user intent associated with the speech input and by searching detailed information
about available media content (e.g., including metadata for recorded programs along with
detailed timing information or detailed information about streaming content). In some
examples, a user may not have access to or may not have a subscription for certain
content. In such instances, content can be offered for purchase, such as via purchase link
948. The cost of the content can be automatically withdrawn from a user account or
charged to a user account upon selection of purchase link 948 or video link 946.
[0120]      FIG. 10 illustrates exemplary process 1000 for controlling television
interactions using a virtual assistant and displaying associated information using different
interfaces. At block 1002, speech input can be received from a user. For example,
speech input can be received at user device 102 or remote control 106 of system 100. In
some examples, the speech input (or a data representation of some or all of the speech
input) can be transmitted to and received by server system 110 and/or television set-top
box 104. In response to a user initiating receipt of speech input, various notifications can
be displayed on a display (such as display 112). For example, a readiness confirmation,
listening confirmation, processing confirmation, and/or command receipt confirmation
can be displayed as discussed above with reference to FIGS. 4A-4E. In addition,
received user speech input can be transcribed, and a transcription can be displayed.
[0121]      Referring again to process 1000 of FIG. 10, at block 1004, media content can
be determined based on the speech input. For example, media content that addresses a
                                              31

WO 2016/003509                                                                PCT/US2015/023089
user query directed at a virtual assistant can be determined (e.g., by searching available
media content or the like). For instance, media content can be determined related to
transcription 492 of FIG. 4E ("What sporting events are on right now?"). Such media
content can include live sporting events being shown on one or more television channels
available to the user for viewing.
[0122]       At block 1006, a first user interface of a first size with selectable media links
can be displayed. For example, media content interface 510 with selectable video links
512 and selectable text links 514 can be displayed on display 112 as shown in FIG. 5. As
discussed above, media content interface 510 can be of a smaller size to avoid interfering
with background video content.
[0123]       At block 1008, a selection of one of the links can be received. For example,
selection of one of links 512 and/or links 514 can be received. At block 1010, a second
user interface of a larger second size with media content associated with the selection can
be displayed. For example, detail interface 618 with selectable video link 620 and
detailed media information 622 can be displayed as shown in FIG. 6B. As discussed
above, detail interface 618 can be of a larger size to convey the desired additional
detailed media information. Similarly, upon selection of video link 620, expanded media
interface 728 can be displayed with video 726 as shown in FIG. 7B. As discussed above,
expanded media interface 728 can be of a larger size still to provide the desired media
content to the user. In this manner, the various interfaces discussed herein can be sized to
accommodate desired content (including expanding into larger sized interfaces or
contracting down to smaller sized interfaces) while otherwise occupying limited screen
real estate. Process 1000 can thus be used to control television interactions using a
virtual assistant and display associated information using different interfaces.
[0124]       In another example, a larger size interface can be displayed over a control
menu than over background video content. For example, speech input interface 836 can
be displayed over menu 830 as shown in FIG. 8B, and assistant result interface 942 can
be displayed over menu 830 as shown in FIG. 9, whereas smaller media content interface
510 can be displayed over video 480 as shown in FIG. 5. In this manner, the size of an
                                                32

WO 2016/003509                                                              PCT/US2015/023089
interface (e.g., the amount of screen real estate occupied by an interface) can be
determined, at least in part, by the type of background content.
[0125]       FIG. 11 illustrates exemplary television media content on user device 102,
which can include a mobile telephone, tablet computer, remote control, or the like with
touchscreen 246 (or another display). FIG. 11 illustrates interface 1150 including a TV
listing with multiple television programs 1152. Interface 1150 can, for example,
correspond to a particular application on user device 102, such as a television control
application, television content listing application, Internet application, or the like. In
some examples, content shown on user device 102 (e.g., on touchscreen 246) can be used
to determine user intent from speech input relating to that content, and the user intent can
be used to cause playback or display of content on another device and display (e.g., on
television set-top box 104 and display 112 and/or speakers 111). For example, content
shown in interface 1150 on user device 102 can be used to disambiguate user requests
and determine user intent from speech input, and the determined user intent can then be
used to play or display media via television set-top box 104.
[0126]       FIG. 12 illustrates exemplary television control using a virtual assistant. FIG.
12 illustrates interface 1254, which can include a virtual assistant interface formatted as a
conversational dialog between the assistant and the user. For example, interface 1254
can include assistant greeting 1256 prompting the user to make a request. Subsequently
received user speech can then be transcribed, such as transcribed user speech 1258,
showing the back and forth conversation. In some examples, interface 1254 can appear
on user device 102 in response to a trigger to initiate receipt of speech input (triggers
such as button presses, key phrases, or the like).
[0127]       In one example, a user request to play content via television set-top box 104
(e.g., on display 112 and speakers 111) can include an ambiguous reference to something
shown on user device 102. Transcribed user speech 1258, for example, includes a
reference to "that" soccer game ("Put on that soccer game."). The particular soccer game
desired can be unclear from the speech input alone. In some examples, however, the
content shown on user device 102 can be used to disambiguate user requests and
determine user intent. In one example, content shown on user device 102 prior to the
                                              33

WO 2016/003509                                                             PCT/US2015/023089
user making the request (e.g., prior to interface 1254 appearing on touchscreen 246) can
be used to determine user intent (as can content appearing within interface 1254, such as
previous queries and results). In the illustrated example, the content shown in interface
1150 of FIG. 11 can be used to determine the user intent from the command to put on
"that" soccer game. The TV listing of television programs 1152 includes a variety of
different programs, one of which is titled "Soccer" appearing on Channel 5. The
appearance of the soccer listing can be used to determine the user's intent from uttering
"that" soccer game. In particular, the user's reference to "that" soccer game can be
resolved to the soccer program appearing in the TV listing of interface 1150.
Accordingly, the virtual assistant can cause playback of that particular soccer game that
the user desired (e.g., by causing television set-top box 104 to tune to the appropriate
channel and show the game).
[0128]      In other examples, a user can reference television programs shown in interface
1150 in a variety of other ways (e.g., the show on channel eight, the news, the drama
show, the advertisement, the first show, etc.), and user intent can similarly be determined
based on displayed content. It should be appreciated that metadata associated with
displayed content (e.g., TV program descriptions), fuzzy matching techniques, synonym
matching, and the like can further be used in conjunction with displayed content to
determine user intent. For example, the term "advertisement" can be matched to the
description "paid programming" (e.g., using synonyms and/or fuzzy matching
techniques) to determine user intent from a request to show "the advertisement."
Likewise, the description of a particular TV program can be analyzed in determining user
intent. For example, the term "law" could be identified in the detailed description of a
courtroom drama, and the user intent can be determined from a user request to watch the
"law" show based on the detailed description associated with the content shown in
interface 1150. Displayed content and data associated with it can thus be used to
disambiguate user requests and determine user intent.
[0129]       FIG. 13 illustrates exemplary picture and video content on user device 102,
which can include a mobile telephone, tablet computer, remote control, or the like with
touchscreen 246 (or another display). FIG. 13 illustrates interface 1360 including a
listing of photos and videos. Interface 1360 can, for example, correspond to a particular
                                              34

WO 2016/003509                                                              PCT/US2015/023089
application on user device 102, such as a media content application, file navigation
application, storage application, remote storage management application, camera
application, or the like. As shown, interface 1360 can include video 1362, photo album
1364 (e.g., a group of multiple photos), and photos 1366. As discussed above with
reference to FIG. 11 and FIG. 12, content shown on user device 102 can be used to
determine user intent from speech input relating to that content. The user intent can then
be used to cause playback or display of content on another device and display (e.g., on
television set-top box 104 and display 112 and/or speakers 111). For example, content
shown in interface 1360 on user device 102 can be used to disambiguate user requests
and to determine user intent from speech input, and the determined user intent can then
be used to play or display media via television set-top box 104.
[0130]      FIG. 14 illustrates exemplary media display control using a virtual assistant.
FIG. 14 illustrates interface 1254, which can include a virtual assistant interface
formatted as a conversational dialog between the assistant and the user. As shown,
interface 1254 can include assistant greeting 1256 prompting the user to make a request.
Within the dialog, user speech can then be transcribed as shown by the examples of FIG.
14. In some examples, interface 1254 can appear on user device 102 in response to a
trigger to initiate receipt of speech input (triggers such as button presses, key phrases, or
the like).
[0131]      In one example, a user request to play media content or display media via
television set-top box 104 (e.g., on display 112 and speakers 111) can include an
ambiguous reference to something shown on user device 102. Transcribed user speech
1468, for example, includes a reference to "that" video ("Show that video."). The
particular video referenced can be unclear from the speech input alone. In some
examples, however, the content shown on user device 102 can be used to disambiguate
user requests and determine user intent. In one example, content shown on user device
120 prior to the user making the request (e.g., prior to interface 1254 appearing on
touchscreen 246) can be used to determine user intent (as can content appearing within
interface 1254, such as previous queries and results). In the example of user speech
1468, the content shown in interface 1360 of FIG. 13 can be used to determine the user
intent from the command to show "that" video. The listing of photos and videos in
                                                35

WO 2016/003509                                                             PCT/US2015/023089
interface 1360 includes a variety of different photos and a video, including video 1362,
photo album 1354, and photos 1366. As only one video appears in interface 1360 (e.g.,
video 1362), the appearance of video 1362 in interface 1360 can be used to determine the
user's intent from uttering "that" video. In particular, the user's reference to "that" video
can be resolved to video 1362 (titled "Graduation Video") appearing in interface 1360.
Accordingly, the virtual assistant can cause playback of video 1362 (e.g., by causing
video 1362 to be transmitted to television set-top box 104 from user device 102 or remote
storage and causing playback to commence).
[0132]      In another example, transcribed user speech 1470 includes a reference to
"that" album ("Play a slideshow of that album."). The particular album referenced can be
unclear from the speech input alone. The content shown on user device 102 can again be
used to disambiguate the user request. In particular, the content shown in interface 1360
of FIG. 13 can be used to determine the user intent from the command to play a
slideshow of "that" album. The listing of photos and videos in interface 1360 includes
photo album 1354. The appearance of photo album 1364 in interface 1360 can be used to
determine the user's intent from uttering "that" album. In particular, the user's reference
to "that" album can be resolved to photo album 1364 (titled "Graduation Album")
appearing in interface 1360. In response to user speech 1470, therefore, the virtual
assistant can cause a slideshow to be displayed including the photos from photo album
1364 (e.g., by causing the photos of photo album 1364 to be transmitted to television set
top box 104 from user device 102 or remote storage and causing a slideshow of the
photos to commence).
[0133]      In yet another example, transcribed user speech 1472 includes a reference to
the "last" photo ("Display the last photo on the kitchen television."). The particular
photo referenced can be unclear from the speech input alone. The content shown on user
device 102 can again be used to disambiguate the user request. In particular, the content
shown in interface 1360 of FIG. 13 can be used to determine the user intent from the
command to display the "last" photo. The listing of photos and videos in interface 1360
includes two individual photos 1366. The appearance of photos 1366 in interface 1360
and particularly the order of appearance of photos 1366 within the interface-can be used
to determine the user's intent from utter the "last" photo. In particular, the user's
                                              36

WO 2016/003509                                                              PCT/US2015/023089
reference to the "last" photo can be resolved to photo 1366 appearing at the bottom of
interface 1360 (dated June 21, 2014). In response to user speech 1472, therefore, the
virtual assistant can cause the last photo 1366 shown in interface 1360 to be displayed
(e.g., by causing the last photo 1366 to be transmitted to television set-top box 104 from
user device 102 or remote storage and causing the photo to be displayed).
[0134]      In other examples, a user can reference media content shown in interface 1360
in a variety of other ways (e.g., the last couple of photos, all of the videos, all of the
photos, the graduation album, the graduation video, the photo from June 21st, etc.), and
user intent can similarly be determined based on displayed content. It should be
appreciated that metadata associated with displayed content (e.g., timestamps, location
information, titles, descriptions, etc.), fuzzy matching techniques, synonym matching,
and the like can further be used in conjunction with displayed content to determine user
intent. Displayed content and data associated with it can thus be used to disambiguate
user requests and determine user intent.
[0135]      It should be understood that any type of displayed content in any application
interface of any application can be used in determining user intent. For example, images
displayed on a webpage in an Internet browser application can be referenced in speech
input, and the displayed webpage content can be analyzed to identify the desired images.
Similarly, a music track in a list of music in a music application can be referenced in
speech input by title, genre, artist, band name, or the like, and the displayed content in the
music application (and associated metadata in some examples) can be used to determine
user intent from the speech input. As discussed above, the determined user intent can
then be used to cause media display or playback via another device, such as via television
set-top box 104.
[0136]      In some examples, user identification, user authentication, and/or device
authentication can be employed to determine whether media control can be permitted,
determine media content available for display, determine access permissions, and the
like. For example, it can be determined whether a particular user device (e.g., user device
102) is authorized to control media on, for example, television set-top box 104. A user
device can be authorized based on a registration, pairing, trust determination, passcode,
                                               37

WO 2016/003509                                                               PCT/US2015/023089
security question, system setup, or the like. In response to determining that a particular
user device is authorized, attempts to control television set-top box 104 can be permitted
(e.g., media content can be played in response to determining that a requesting device is
authorized to control media). In contrast, media control commands or requests from
unauthorized devices can be ignored, and/or users of such devices can be prompted to
register their devices for use in controlling a particular television set-top box 104.
[0137]      In another example, a particular user can be identified, and personal data
associated with the user can be used to determine user intent of requests. For example, a
user can be identified based on speech input, such as by voice recognition using a
voiceprint of the user. In some examples, users can utter a particular phrase that is
analyzed for voice recognition. In other examples, speech input requests directed to the
virtual assistant can be analyzed using voice recognition to identify the speaker. A user
can also be identified based on the source of the speech input sample (e.g., on a user's
personal device 102). A user can also be identified based on passwords, passcodes, menu
selection, or the like. Speech input received from the user can then be interpreted based
on personal data of the identified user. For example, user intent of speech input can be
determined based on previous requests from the user, media content owned by the user,
media content stored on the user's device, user preferences, user settings, user
demographics (e.g., languages spoken, etc.), user profile information, user payment
methods, or a variety of other personal information associated with a particular identified
user. For instance, speech input referencing a favorites list or the like can be
disambiguated based on personal data, and the user's personal favorites list can be
identified. Speech input referencing "my" photos, "my" videos, "my" shows, or the like
can likewise be disambiguated based on user identification to correctly identify photos,
videos, and shows associated with the identified user (e.g., photos stored on a personal
user device or the like). Similarly, speech input requesting purchase of content can be
disambiguated to determine that the identified user's payment method should be charged
for the purchase (as opposed to another user's payment method).
[0138]      In some examples, user authentication can be used to determine whether a
user is allowed to access media content, purchase media content, or the like. For
example, voice recognition can be used to verify the identity of a particular user (e.g.,
                                               38

WO 2016/003509                                                               PCT/US2015/023089
using their voiceprint) to permit the user to make purchases using the user's payment
method. Similarly, passwords or the like can be used to authenticate the user to permit
purchases. In another example, voice recognition can be used to verify the identity of a
particular user to determine whether the user is allowed to watch a particular program
(e.g., a program having a particular parental guideline rating, a movie having a particular
age suitability rating, or the like). For instance, a child's request for a particular program
can be denied based on voice recognition indicating that the requester is not an authorized
user able to view such content (e.g., a parent). In other examples, voice recognition can
be used to determine whether users have access to particular subscription content (e.g.,
restricting access to premium channel content based on voice recognition). In some
examples, users can utter a particular phrase that is analyzed for voice recognition. In
other examples, speech input requests directed to the virtual assistant can be analyzed
using voice recognition to identify the speaker. Certain media content can thus be played
in response to first determining that a user is authorized in any of a variety of ways.
[0139]      FIG. 15 illustrates exemplary virtual assistant interactions with results on a
mobile user device and a media display device. In some examples, a virtual assistant can
provide information and control on more than one device, such as on user device 102 as
well as on television set-top box 104. Moreover, in some examples, the same virtual
assistant interface used for control and information on user device 102 can be used to
issue requests for controlling media on television set-top box 104. As such, the virtual
assistant system can determine whether to display results or execute tasks on user device
102 or on television set-top box 104. In some examples, when employing user device
102 to control television set-top box 104, virtual assistant interface intrusion on a display
associated with television set-top box 104 (e.g., display 112) can be minimized by
displaying information on user device 102 (e.g., on touchscreen 246). In other examples,
virtual assistant information can be displayed on display 112 alone, or virtual assistant
information can be displayed on both user device 102 and display 112.
[0140]      In some examples, a determination can be made as to whether results of a
virtual assistant query should be displayed on user device 102 directly or on display 112
associated with television set-top box 104. In one example, in response to determining
that the user intent of a query includes a request for information, an informational
                                               39

WO 2016/003509                                                              PCT/US2015/023089
response can be displayed on user device 102. In another example, in response to
determining that the user intent of a query includes a request to play media content,
media content responsive to the query can be played via television set-top box 104.
[0141]       FIG. 15 illustrates virtual assistant interface 1254 with a conversational dialog
example between a virtual assistant and a user. Assistant greeting 1256 can prompt the
user to make a request. In the first query, transcribed user speech 1574 (which can also
be typed or entered in other ways) includes a request for an informational answer
associated with displayed media content. In particular, transcribed user speech 1574
inquires who is playing in a soccer game that may be, for example, shown on an interface
on user device 102 (e.g., listed in interface 1150 of FIG. 11) or on display 112 (e.g., listed
in interface 510 of FIG. 5 or playing as video 726 on display 112 of FIG. 7B). The user
intent of transcribed user speech 1574 can be determined based on displayed media
content. For example, the particular soccer game in question can be identified based on
content shown on user device 102 or on display 112. The user intent of transcribed user
speech 1574 can include obtaining an informational answer detailing the teams playing in
the soccer game identified based on the displayed content. In response to determining
that the user intent includes a request for an informational answer, the system can
determine to display the response within interface 1254 in FIG. 15 (as opposed to on
display 112). The response to the query can, in some examples, be determined based on
metadata associated with the displayed content (e.g., based on a description of the soccer
game in a television listing). As shown, assistant response 1576 can thus be displayed on
touchscreen 246 of user device 102 in interface 1254, identifying teams Alpha and Zeta
as playing in the game. Accordingly, in some examples, an informational response can
be displayed within interface 1254 on user device 102 based on determining that a query
includes an informational request.
[0142]       The second query in interface 1254, however, includes a media request. In
particular, transcribed user speech 1578 requests changing displayed media content to
"the game." The user intent of transcribed user speech 1578 can be determined based on
displayed content (e.g., to identify which game the user desires), such as a game listed in
interface 510 of FIG. 5, a game listed in interface 1150 of FIG. 11, a game referenced in
previous queries (e.g., in transcribed user speech 1574), or the like. The user intent of
                                                40

WO 2016/003509                                                             PCT/US2015/023089
transcribed user speech 1578 can thus include changing displayed content to a particular
game-here, the soccer game with teams Alpha and Zeta. In one example, the game can
be displayed on user device 102. In other examples, however, based on the query
including a request to play media content, the game can be shown via television set-top
box 104. In particular, in response to determining that the user intent includes a request
to play media content, the system can determine to display the media content result via
television set-top box 104 on display 112 (as opposed to within interface 1254 in FIG.
15). In some examples, a response or paraphrase confirming the virtual assistant's
intended action can be shown in interface 1254 or on display 112 (e.g., "Changing to the
soccer game.").
[0143]      FIG. 16 illustrates exemplary virtual assistant interactions with media results
on a media display device and a mobile user device. In some examples, a virtual assistant
can provide access to media on both user device 102 and television set-top box 104.
Moreover, in some examples, the same virtual assistant interface used for media on user
device 102 can be used to issue requests for media on television set-top box 104. As
such, the virtual assistant system can determine whether to display media results on user
device 102 or on display 112 via television set-top box 104.
[0144]      In some examples, a determination can be made as to whether to display
media on device 102 or on display 112 based on media result format, user preference,
default settings, an express command in the request itself, or the like. For example, the
format of a media result to a query can be used to determine on which device to display
the media result by default (e.g., without specific instructions). A television program can
be better suited for display on a television, a large format video can be better suited for
display on a television, thumbnail photos can be better suited for display on a user device,
small format web videos can be better suited for display on a user device, and various
other media formats can be better suited for display on either a relatively large television
screen or a relatively small user device display. Thus, in response to a determination that
media content should be displayed on a particular display (e.g., based on media format),
the media content can be displayed on that particular display by default.

WO 2016/003509                                                            PCT/US2015/023089
[0145]      FIG. 16 illustrates virtual assistant interface 1254 with examples of queries
related to playing or displaying media content. Assistant greeting 1256 can prompt the
user to make a request. In the first query, transcribed user speech 1680 includes a request
to show a soccer game. As in the examples discussed above, the user intent of
transcribed user speech 1680 can be determined based on displayed content (e.g., to
identify which game the user desires), such as a game listed in interface 510 of FIG. 5, a
game listed in interface 1150 of FIG. 11, a game referenced in previous queries, or the
like. The user intent of transcribed user speech 1680 can thus include displaying a
particular soccer game that may, for example, be aired on television. In response to
determining that the user intent includes a request to display media that is formatted for
television (e.g., a televised soccer game), the system can automatically determine to
display the desired media on display 112 via television set-top box 104 (as opposed to on
user device 102 itself). The virtual assistant system can then cause television set-top box
104 to tune to the soccer game and show it on display 112 (e.g., by executing the
necessary tasks and/or sending the appropriate commands).
[0146]      In the second query, however, transcribed user speech 1682 includes a request
to show pictures of players of a team (e.g., pictures of "Team Alpha"). As in the
examples discussed above, the user intent of transcribed user speech 1682 can be
determined. The user intent of transcribed user speech 1682 can include performing a
search (e.g., a web search) for pictures associated with "Team Alpha," and displaying the
resulting pictures. In response to determining that the user intent includes a request to
display media that may be presented in thumbnail format, or media associated with a web
search, or other non-specific media without a particular format, the system can
automatically determine to display the desired media result on touchscreen 246 in
interface 1254 of user device 102 (as opposed to displaying the resulting pictures on
display 112 via television set-top box 104). For example, as shown, thumbnail photos
1684 can be displayed within interface 1254 on user device 102 in response to the user's
query. The virtual assistant system can thus cause media of a certain format, or media
that might be presented in a certain format (e.g., in a group of thumbnails), to be
displayed on user device 102 by default.

WO 2016/003509                                                             PCT/US2015/023089
[0147]       It should be appreciated that, in some examples, the soccer game referenced in
user speech 1680 can be shown on user device 102, and photos 1684 can be shown on
display 112 via television set-top box 104. The default device for display, however, can
be determined automatically based on media format, thereby simplifying media
commands for the user. In other examples, the default device for displaying requested
media content can be determined based on user preferences, default settings, the device
used most recently to display content, voice recognition to identify a user and a device
associated with that user, or the like. For example, a user can set a preference or a default
configuration can be set to display certain types of content (e.g., videos, slideshows,
television programs, etc.) on display 112 via television set-top box 104 and other types of
content (e.g., thumbnails, photos, web videos, etc.) on touchscreen 246 of user device
102. Similarly, preferences or default configurations can be set to respond to certain
queries by displaying content on one device or the other. In another example, all content
can be displayed on user device 102 unless the user instructs otherwise.
[0148]       In still other examples, a user query can include a command to display content
on a particular display. For example, user speech 1472 of FIG. 14 includes a command
to display a photo on the kitchen television. As a result, the system can cause display of
the photo on a television display associated with the user's kitchen as opposed to
displaying the photo on user device 102. In other examples, a user can dictate which
display device to use in a variety of other ways (e.g., on TV, on the big screen, in the
living room, in the bedroom, on my tablet, on my phone, etc.). The display device to use
for displaying media content results of virtual assistant queries can thus be determined in
a variety of different ways.
[0149]       FIG. 17 illustrates exemplary media device control based on proximity. In
some examples, users may have multiple televisions and television set-top boxes within
the same household or on the same network. For example, a household may have a
television and set-top box set in the living room, another set in the bedroom, and another
set in the kitchen. In other examples, multiple set-top boxes can be connected to the
same network, such as a common network in an apartment or office building. Although
users can pair, connect, or otherwise authorize remote control 106 and user device 102
for a particular set-top box to avoid unauthorized access, in other examples, remote
                                               43

WO 2016/003509                                                            PCT/US2015/023089
controls and/or user devices can be used to control more than one set-top box. A user
can, for example, use a single user device 102 to control a set-top box in the bedroom, in
the living room, and in the kitchen. A user can also, for example, use a single user device
102 to control their own set-top box in their own apartment, as well as control a
neighbor's set-top box in a neighbor's apartment (e.g., sharing content from user device
102 with the neighbor, such as showing a slideshow on the neighbor's TV of photos
stored on user device 102). Because the user can use a single user device 102 to control
multiple different set-top boxes, the system can determine to which set-top box of
multiple set-top boxes to send commands. Likewise, because a household can have
multiple remote controls 106 that can operate multiple set-top boxes, the system can
similarly determine to which set-top box of multiple set-top boxes to send commands.
[0150]      In one example, proximity of devices can be used to determine to which of
multiple set-top boxes to send commands (or on which display to show requested media
content). A proximity can be determined between a user device 102 or remote control
106 and each of multiple set-top boxes. Issued commands can then be sent to the nearest
set-top box (or requested media content can be displayed on the nearest display).
Proximity can be determined (or at least approximated) in any of a variety of ways, such
as time-of-flight measurements (e.g., using radio frequency), Bluetooth LE, electronic
ping signals, proximity sensors, sound travel measurements, or the like. Measured or
approximated distances can then be compared, and the device with the shortest distance
can be issued the command (e.g., the nearest set-top box).
[0151]      FIG. 17 illustrates multi-device system 1790 including first set-top box 1792
with first display 1786 and second set-top box 1794 with second display 1788. In one
example, a user can issue a command from user device 102 to display media content
(e.g., without necessarily specifying where or on which device). Distance 1795 to first
set-top box 1792 and distance 1796 to second set-top box 1794 can then be determined
(or approximated). As shown, distance 1796 can be greater than distance 1795. Based
on proximity, the command from user device 102 can be issued to first set-top box 1792
as the nearest device and the likeliest to match the user's intent. In some examples, a
single remote control 106 can also be used to control more than one set-top box. The
desired device for control at a given time can be determined based on proximity.
                                              44

WO 2016/003509                                                            PCT/US2015/023089
Distance 1797 to second set-top box 1794 and distance 1798 to first set-top box 1792 can
be determined (or approximated). As shown, distance 1798 can be greater than distance
1797. Based on proximity, commands from remote control 106 can be issued to second
set-top box 1794 as the nearest device and the likeliest to match the user's intent.
Distance measurements can be refreshed regularly or with each command to
accommodate, for example, a user moving to a different room and desiring to control a
different device.
[0152]      It should be understood that a user can specify a different device for a
command, in some cases overriding proximity. For example, a list of available display
devices can be displayed on user device 102 (e.g., listing first display 1786 and second
display 1788 by setup name, designated room, or the like, or listing first set-top box 1792
and second set-top box 1794 by setup name, designated room, or the like). A user can
select one of the devices from the list, and commands can then be sent to the selected
device. Requests for media content issued at user device 102 can then be handled by
displaying the desired media on the selected device. In other examples, users can speak
the desired device as part of a spoken command (e.g., show the game on the kitchen
television, change to the cartoon channel in the living room, etc.).
[0153]      In still other examples, the default device for showing requested media
content can be determined based on status information associated with a particular
device. For example, it can be determined whether headphones (or a headset) are
attached to user device 102. In response to determining that headphones are attached to
user device 102 when a request to display media content is received, the requested
content can be displayed on user device 102 by default (e.g., assuming the user is
consuming content on user device 102 and not on a television). In response to
determining that headphones are not attached to user device 102 when a request to
display media content is received, the requested content can be displayed on either user
device 102 or on a television according to any of the various determination methods
discussed herein. Other device status information can similarly be used to determine
whether requested media content should be displayed on user device 102 or a set-top box
104, such as ambient lighting around user device 102 or set-top box 104, proximity of
other devices to user device 102 or set-top box 104, orientation of user device 102 (e.g.,
                                              45

WO 2016/003509                                                              PCT/US2015/023089
landscape orientation can be more likely to indicate desired viewing on user device 102),
display status of set-top box 104 (e.g., in a sleep mode), time since the last interaction on
a particular device, or any of a variety of other status indicators for user device 102
and/or set-top box 104.
[0154]       FIG. 18 illustrates exemplary process 1800 for controlling television
interactions using a virtual assistant and multiple user devices. At block 1802, speech
input can be received from a user at a first device with a first display. For example,
speech input can be received from a user at user device 102 or remote control 106 of
system 100. The first display can include touchscreen 246 of user device 102 or a display
associated with remote control 106 in some examples.
[0155]       At block 1804, user intent can be determined from the speech input based on
content displayed on the first display. For example, content such as television programs
1152 in interface 1150 of FIG. 11 or photos and videos in interface 1360 of FIG. 13 can
be analyzed and used to determine user intent for speech input. In some examples, a user
can refer to content shown on the first display in ambiguous ways, and the references can
be disambiguated by analyzing the content shown on the first display to resolve the
references (e.g., determining the user intent for "that" video, "that" album, "that" game,
or the like), as discussed above with reference to FIG. 12 and FIG. 14.
[0156]       Referring again to process 1800 of FIG. 18, at block 1806, media content can
be determined based on the user intent. For example, a particular video, photo, photo
album, television program, sporting event, music track, or the like can be identified based
on the user intent. In the example of FIG. 11 and FIG. 12 discussed above, for instance,
the particular soccer game shown on channel five can be identified based on the user
intent referring to "that" soccer game shown in interface 1150 of FIG. 11. In the
examples of FIG. 13 and FIG. 14 discussed above, the particular video 1362 titled
"Graduation Video," the particular photo album 1364 titled "Graduation Album," or a
particular photo 1366 can be identified based on the user intent determined from the
speech input examples of FIG. 14.
[0157]       Referring again to process 1800 of FIG. 18, at block 1808, the media content
can be played on a second device associated with a second display. For example, the
                                               46

WO 2016/003509                                                              PCT/US2015/023089
determined media content can be played via television set-top box 104 on display 112
with speakers 111. Playing the media content can include tuning to a particular television
channel, playing a particular video, showing a slideshow of photos, displaying a
particular photo, playing a particular audio track, or the like on television set-top box 104
or another device.
[0158]      In some examples, a determination can be made as to whether responses to
speech input directed to a virtual assistant should be displayed on a first display
associated with a first device (e.g., user device 102) or a second display associated with a
second device (e.g., television set-top box 104). For example, as discussed above with
reference to FIG. 15 and FIG. 16, informational answers or media content suited for
display on a smaller screen can be displayed on user device 102, while media responses
or media content suited for display on a larger screen can be displayed on a display
associated with set-top box 104. As discussed above with reference to FIG. 17, in some
examples, the distance between user device 102 and multiple set-top boxes can be used to
determine on which set-top box to play media content or to which set-top box to issue
commands. Various other determinations can similarly be made to provide a convenient
and user-friendly experience where multiple devices may be interacting.
[0159]      In some examples, as content shown on user device 102 can be used to inform
interpretations of speech input as discussed above, content shown on display 112 can
likewise be used to inform interpretations of speech input. In particular, content shown
on a display associated with television set-top box 104 can be used along with metadata
associated with that content to determine user intent from speech input, disambiguate
user queries, respond to content-related queries, or the like.
[0160]      FIG. 19 illustrates exemplary speech input interface 484 (described above)
with a virtual assistant query about video 480 shown in the background. In some
examples, user queries can include questions about media content shown on display 112.
For example, transcription 1916 includes a query requesting identification of actresses
("Who are those actresses?"). Content shown on display 112-along with metadata or
other descriptive information about the content-can be used to determine user intent
from speech input relating to that content as well as to determine responses to queries
                                               47

WO 2016/003509                                                                    PCT/US2015/023089
(responses including both informational responses as well as media responses providing
media selections to the user). For example, video 480, a description of video 480, a
character and actor list for video 480, rating information for video 480, genre information
for video 480, and a variety of other descriptive information associated with video 480
can be used to disambiguate user requests and determine responses to user queries.
Associated metadata can include, for example, identifying information for character
1910, character 1912, and character 1914 (e.g., character names along with the names of
the actresses who play the characters). Metadata for any other content can similarly
include a title, a description, a list of characters, a list of actors, a list of players, a genre,
producer names, director names, or a display schedule associated with the content shown
on the display or the viewing history of media content on the display (e.g., recently
displayed media).
[0161]      In one example, a user query directed to a virtual assistant can include an
ambiguous reference to something shown on display 112. Transcription 1916, for
example, includes a reference to "those" actresses ("Who are those actresses?"). The
particular actresses the user is asking about can be unclear from the speech input alone.
In some examples, however, the content shown on display 112 and associated metadata
can be used to disambiguate user requests and determine user intent. In the illustrated
example, the content shown on display 112 can be used to determine the user intent from
the reference to "those" actresses. In one example, television set-top box 104 can
identify playing content along with details associated with the content. In this instance,
television set-top box 104 can identify the title of video 480 along with a variety of
descriptive content. In other examples, a television show, sporting event, or other content
can be shown that can be used in conjunction with associated metadata to determine user
intent. In addition, in any of the various examples discussed herein, speech recognition
results and intent determination can weight terms associated with displayed content
higher than alternatives. For example, actor names for on-screen characters can be
weighted higher while those actors appear on screen (or while a show is playing in which
they appear), which can provide for accurate speech recognition and intent determination
of likely user requests associated with displayed content.
                                                 48

WO 2016/003509                                                            PCT/US2015/023089
[0162]      In one example, a character and/or actor list associated with video 480 can be
used to identify all or the most prominent actresses appearing in video 480, which might
include actresses 1910, 1912, and 1914. The identified actresses can be returned as a
possible result (including fewer or additional actresses if the metadata resolution is
coarse). In another example, however, metadata associated with video 480 can include
an identification of which actors and actresses appear on screen at a given time, and the
actresses appearing at the time of the query can be determined from that metadata (e.g.,
specifically identifying actresses 1910, 1912, and 1914). In yet another example, a facial
recognition application can be used to identify actresses 1910, 1912, and 1914 from the
images shown on display 112. In still other examples, various other metadata associated
with video 480 and various other recognition approaches can be used to identify the
user's likely intent in referring to "those" actresses.
[0163]      In some examples, the content shown on display 112 can change during
submission of a query and determination of a response. As such, a viewing history of
media content can be used to determine user intent and determine the response to a query.
For example, should video 480 move to another view (e.g., with other characters) before
a response to the query is generated, the result of the query can be determined based on
the user's view at the time the query was spoken (e.g., the characters shown on screen at
the time the user initiated the query). In some instances, a user might pause playing
media to issue a query, and the content shown when paused can be used with associated
metadata to determine user intent and a response to the query.
[0164]      Given the determined user intent, a result of the query can be provided to the
user. FIG. 20 illustrates exemplary assistant response interface 2018 including assistant
response 2020, which can include the response determined from the query of
transcription 1916 of FIG. 19. Assistant response 2020 can include, as shown, a listing of
each actress's name and her associated character in video 480 ("Actress Jennifer Jones
plays the character Blanche; actress Elizabeth Arnold plays the character Julia; and
actress Whitney Davidson plays the character Melissa."). The listed actresses and
characters in response 2020 can correspond to characters 1910, 1912, and 1914 appearing
on display 112. As noted above, in some examples, the content shown on display 112
can change during submission of a query and determination of a response. As such,
                                               49

response 2020 can include information about content or characters that may no longer
appear on display 112.
[0165]       As with other interfaces displayed on display 112, assistant response interface
2018 can occupy a minimal amount of screen real estate while providing sufficient space
to convey the desired information. In some examples, as with other text displayed in
interfaces on display 112, assistant response 2020 can be scrolled up into the position
shown in FIG. 20 from the bottom of display 112, displayed for a certain amount of time
(e.g., a delay based on the length of the response), and scrolled up out of view. In other
examples, interface 2018 can be slid downward out of view after a delay.
[0166]       FIG. 21 and FIG. 22 illustrate another example of determining user intent and
responding to a query based on content shown on display 112. FIG. 21 illustrates
exemplary speech input interface 484 with a virtual assistant query for media content
associated with video 480. In some examples, user queries can include a request for
media content associated with media shown on display 112. For example, a user can
request other movies, television programs, sporting events, or the like associated with
particular media based, for example, on a character, actor, genre, or the like. For
example, transcription 2122 includes a query requesting other media associated with an
actress in video 480, referenced by her character's name in video 480 ("What else is
Blanche in?"). Content shown on display 112-along with metadata or other descriptive
information about the content-can again be used to determine user intent from speech
input relating to that content as well as to determine responses to queries (either
informational or resulting in media selections).
[0167]       In some examples, a user query directed to a virtual assistant can include an
ambiguous reference using the name of a character, the name of an actor, the name of a
program, the name of player, or the like. Without the context of the content shown on
display 112 and its associated metadata, such references may be difficult to resolve
accurately. Transcription 2122, for example, includes a reference to a character named
"Blanche" from video 480. The particular actress or other individual the user is asking
about can be unclear from the speech input alone. In some examples, however, the
content shown on display 112 and associated metadata can be used to disambiguate user

requests and determine user intent. In the illustrated example, the content shown on
display 112 and associated metadata can be used to determine the user intent from the
character name "Blanche." In this instance, a character list associated with video 480 can
be used to determine that "Blanche" likely refers to the character "Blanche" in video 480.
In another example, detailed metadata and/or facial recognition can be used to determine
that a character with the name "Blanche" appears on the screen (or appeared on the
screen at the initiation of the user's query), making the actress associated with that
character the likeliest intention of the user's query. For example, it can be determined
that characters 1910, 1912, and 1914 appear on display 112 (or appeared on display 112
at the initiation of the user's query), and their associated character names can then be
referenced to determine the user intent of the query referencing the character Blanche.
An actor list can then be used to identify the actress who plays Blanche, and a search can
be conducted to identify other media in which the identified actress appears.
[0168]       Given the determined user intent (e.g., resolution of the character reference
"Blanche") and the determination of the result of the query (e.g., other media associated
with the actress who plays "Blanche"), a response can be provided to the user. FIG. 22
illustrates exemplary assistant response interface 2224 including assistant text response
2226 and selectable video links 2228, which can be responsive to the query of
transcription 2122 of FIG. 21. Assistant text response 2226 can include, as shown, a
paraphrase of the user request introducing selectable video links 2228. Assistant text
response 2226 can also include an indication of the disambiguation of the user's query
in particular, identifying actress Jennifer Jones as playing the character Blanche in video
480. Such a paraphrase can confirm to the user that the virtual assistant correctly
interpreted the user's query and is providing the desired result.
[0169]       Assistant response interface 2224 can also include selectable video links 2228.
In some examples, various types of media content can be provided as results to a virtual
assistant query, including movies (e.g., Movie A and Movie B of interface 2224). Media
content displayed as a result of a query can include media that may be available to the
user for consumption (for free, for purchase, or as part of a subscription). A user can
select displayed media to view or consume the resulting content. For instance, a user can
select one of selectable video links 2228 (e.g., using a remote control, voice command, or
                                               51

WO 2016/003509                                                              PCT/US2015/023089
the like) to watch one of the other movies in which actress Jennifer Jones appears. In
response to selection of one of selectable video links 2228, the video associated with the
selection can be played, replacing video 480 on display 112. Thus, displayed media
content and associated metadata can be used to determine user intent from speech input,
and, in some examples, playable media can be provided as a result.
[0170]        It should be understood that a user can reference actors, players, characters,
locations, teams, sporting event details, movie subjects, or a variety of other information
associated with displayed content in forming queries, and the virtual assistant system can
similarly disambiguate such requests and determine user intent based on displayed
content and associated metadata. Likewise, it should be understood that, in some
examples, results can include media suggestions associated with the query, such as a
movie, television show, or sporting event associated with a person who is the subject of a
query (whether or not the user specifically requests such media content).
[0171]       Moreover, in some examples, user queries can include requests for
information associated with media content itself, such as queries about a character, an
episode, a movie plot, a previous scene, or the like. As with the examples discussed
above, displayed content and associated metadata can be used to determine user intent
from such queries and determine a response. For instance, a user might request a
description of a character (e.g., "What does Blanche do in this movie?"). The virtual
assistant system can then identify from metadata associated with displayed content the
requested information about the character, such as a character description or role (e.g.,
"Blanche is one of a group of lawyers and is known as a troublemaker in Hartford.").
Similarly, a user might request an episode synopsis (e.g., "What happened in the last
episode?"), and the virtual assistant system can search for and provide a description of
the episode.
[0172]       In some examples, content displayed on display 112 can include menu
content, and such menu content can similarly be used to determine user intent of speech
input and responses to user queries. FIGS. 23A-23B illustrate exemplary pages of a
program menu 830. FIG. 23A illustrates a first page of media options 832, and FIG. 23B
                                               52

WO 2016/003509                                                            PCT/US2015/023089
illustrates a second page of media options 832 (which can include a consecutive next
page in a listing of content that extends beyond a single page).
[0173]       In one example, a user request to play content can include an ambiguous
reference to something shown on display 112 in menu 830. For example, a user viewing
menu 830 can request to watch "that" soccer game, "that" basketball game, the vacuum
advertisement, the law show, or the like. The particular program desired can be unclear
from the speech input alone. In some examples, however, the content shown on display
112 can be used to disambiguate user requests and determine user intent. In the
illustrated example, the media options in menu 830 (along with metadata associated with
the media options in some examples) can be used to determine the user intent from
commands including ambiguous references. For example, "that" soccer game can be
resolved to the soccer game on the sports channel. "That" basketball game can be
resolved to the basketball game on the college sports channel. The vacuum
advertisement can be resolved to the paid programming show (e.g., based on metadata
associated with the show describing a vacuum). The law show can be resolved to the
courtroom drama based on metadata associated with the show and/or synonym matching,
fuzzy matching, or other matching techniques. The appearance of the various media
options 832 in menu 830 on display 112 can thus be used to disambiguate user requests.
[0174]       In some examples, displayed menus can be navigated with a cursor, joystick,
arrows, buttons, gestures, or the like. In such instances, a focus can be shown for a
selected item. For example, a selected item can be shown in bold, underlined, outlined
with a border, in larger size than other menu items, with a shadow, with a reflection, with
a glow, and/or with any other features to emphasize which menu item is selected and has
focus. For example, selected media option 2330 in FIG. 23A can have focus as the
currently selected media option, and is shown with large, underlined type and a border.
[0175]       In some examples, a request to play content or select a menu item can include
an ambiguous reference to a menu item that has focus. For example, a user viewing
menu 830 of FIG. 23A can request to play "that" show (e.g., "Play that show.").
Similarly, a user could request various other commands associated with a menu item
having focus, such as play, delete, hide, remind me to watch that, record that, or the like.
                                              53

WO 2016/003509                                                              PCT/US2015/023089
The particular menu item or show that is desired can be unclear from the speech input
alone. The content shown on display 112, however, can be used to disambiguate user
requests and determine user intent. In particular, the fact that selected media option 2330
has focus in menu 830 can be used to identify the desired media subject of any of the
commands referring to "that" show, commands without subjects (e.g., play, delete, hide,
etc.), or any other ambiguous commands referring to the media content having focus. A
menu item having focus can thus be used in determining user intent from speech input.
[0176]      As with a viewing history of media content that can be used to disambiguate a
user request (e.g., content displayed at the time a user initiated a request but since having
passed), previously displayed menu or search result content can similarly be used to
disambiguate later user requests after moving on, for example, to later menu or search
result content. For example, FIG. 23B illustrates a second page of menu 830 with
additional media options 832. A user can advance to the second page illustrated in FIG.
23B but refer back to content shown in the first page illustrated in FIG. 23A (e.g., media
options 832 shown in FIG. 23A). For example, despite having moved on to the second
page of menu 830, a user can request to watch "that" soccer game, "that" basketball
game, or the law show-all of which are media options 832 recently displayed on a
previous page of menu 830. Such references can be ambiguous, but the recently
displayed menu content from the first page of menu 830 can be used to determine the
user intent. In particular, the recently displayed media options 832 of FIG. 23A can be
analyzed to identify the specific soccer game, basketball game, or courtroom drama
referred to in the ambiguous example requests. In some examples, results can be biased
based on how recently content was displayed (e.g., weighting the most recently viewed
page of results over results viewed earlier). In this manner, the viewing history of what
was recently shown on display 112 can be used to determine user intent. It should be
understood that any recently displayed content can be used, such as previously displayed
search results, previously displayed programs, previously displayed menus, or the like.
This can allow users to refer back to something they saw earlier without having to find
and navigate to the specific view in which they saw it.
[0177]      In still other examples, various display cues shown in a menu or results list on
display 112 can be used to disambiguate user requests and determine user intent. FIG. 24
                                               54

WO 2016/003509                                                             PCT/US2015/023089
illustrates an exemplary media menu divided into categories, one of which has focus
(movies). FIG. 24 illustrates category interface 2440, which can include a carousel-style
interface of categorized media options including TV options 2442, movie options 2444,
and music options 2446. As shown, the music category is only partially displayed, and
the carousel interface can be shifted to display additional content to the right (e.g., as
indicated by the arrow) as though rotating the media in a carousel. In the illustrated
example, the movies category has focus as indicated by the underlined title and border,
although focus can be indicated in any of a variety of other ways (e.g., making the
category larger to appear closer to the user than other categories, adding a glow, etc.).
[0178]       In some examples, a request to play content or select a menu item can include
an ambiguous reference to a menu item in a group of items (such as a category). For
example, a user viewing category interface 2440 can request to play the soccer show
("Play the soccer show."). The particular menu item or show that is desired can be
unclear from the speech input alone. Moreover, the query can resolve to more than one
show that is displayed on display 112. For example, the request for the soccer show
might refer to either the soccer game listed in the TV programs category or the soccer
movie listed in the movies category. The content shown on display 112-including
display cues-can be used to disambiguate user requests and determine user intent. In
particular, the fact that the movies category has focus in category interface 2440 can be
used to identify the particular soccer show that is desired, which is likely the soccer
movie given the focus on the movies category. A category of media (or any other
grouping of media) having focus as shown on display 112 can thus be used in
determining user intent from speech input. It should also be appreciated that users can
make various other requests associated with categories, such as requesting display of
certain categorical content (e.g., show me comedy movies, show me horror movies, etc.).
[0179]       In other examples, a user can refer to menu or media items shown on display
112 in a variety of other ways, and user intent can similarly be determined based on
displayed content. It should be appreciated that metadata associated with displayed
content (e.g., TV program descriptions, movie descriptions, etc.), fuzzy matching
techniques, synonym matching, and the like can further be used in conjunction with
displayed content to determine user intent from speech input. User requests in a variety
                                              55

WO 2016/003509                                                             PCT/US2015/023089
of forms-including natural language requests-can thus be accommodated and user
intent can be determined according to the various examples discussed herein.
[0180]       It should be understood that content displayed on display 112 can be used
alone or in conjunction with content displayed on user device 102 or on a display
associated with remote control 106 in determining user intent. Likewise, it should be
understood that virtual assistant queries can be received at any of a variety of devices
communicatively coupled to television set-top box 104, and content displayed on display
112 can be used to determine user intent regardless of which device receives the query.
Results of queries can likewise be displayed on display 112 or on another display (e.g.,
on user device 102).
[0181]       In addition, in any of the various examples discussed herein, the virtual
assistant system can navigate menus and select menu options without requiring a user to
specifically open menus and navigate to menu items. For example, a menu of options
might appear after selecting media content or a menu button, such as selecting a movie
option 2444 in FIG. 24. Menu options might include playing the media as well as
alternatives to simply playing the media, such as setting a reminder to watch the media
later, setting up a recording of the media, adding media to a favorites list, hiding media
from further view, or the like. While a user is viewing content above a menu or content
that has a sub-menu option, the user can issue virtual assistant commands that would
otherwise require navigating to the menu or sub-menu to select. For example, a user
viewing category interface 2440 of FIG. 24 can issue any menu command associated with
a movie option 2444 without opening the associated menu manually. For instance, the
user might request to add the soccer movie to a favorites list, record the nightly news, and
set up a reminder to watch Movie B without ever navigating to the menus or sub-menus
associated with those media options where such commands might be available. The
virtual assistant system can thus navigate menus and sub-menus in order to execute
commands on behalf of the user, whether or not those menu options appear on display
112. This can simplify user requests and reduce the number of clicks or selections a user
must make to achieve desired menu functionality.

WO 2016/003509                                                            PCT/US2015/023089
[0182]      FIG. 25 illustrates exemplary process 2500 for controlling television
interactions using media content shown on a display and a viewing history of media
content. At block 2502, speech input can be received from a user, the speech input
including a query associated with content shown on a television display. For example,
the speech input can include a query about a character, actor, movie, television program,
sporting event, player, or the like appearing on display 112 of system 100 (shown by
television set-top box 104). Transcription 1916 of FIG. 19, for example, includes a query
associated with actresses shown in video 480 on display 112. Similarly, transcription
2122 of FIG. 21 includes a query associated with a character in video 480 shown on
display 112. The speech input can also include a query associated with menu or search
content appearing on display 112, such as a query to select a particular menu item or get
information about a particular search result. For example, displayed menu content can
include media options 832 of menu 830 in FIG. 23A and FIG. 23B. Displayed menu
content can likewise include TV options 2442, movie options 2444, and/or music options
2446 appearing in category interface 2440 of FIG. 24.
[0183]      Referring again to process 2500 of FIG. 25, at block 2504, user intent of the
query can be determined based on the content shown and a viewing history of media
content. For example, user intent can be determined based on a displayed or recently
displayed scene of a television program, sporting event, movie, or the like. User intent
can also be determined based on displayed or recently displayed menu or search content.
Displayed content can also be analyzed along with metadata associated with the content
to determine user intent. For example, the content shown and described with reference to
FIGS. 19, 21, 23A, 23B, and 24 can be used alone or in conjunction with metadata
associated with the displayed content to determine user intent.
[0184]      At block 2506, a result of the query can be displayed based on the determined
user intent. For example, a result similar to assistant response 2020 in assistant response
interface 2018 of FIG. 20 can be displayed on display 112. In another example, text and
selectable media can be provided as a result, such as assistant text response 2226 and
selectable video links 2228 in assistant response interface 2224 shown in FIG. 22. In yet
another example, displaying the result of the query can include displaying or playing
selected media content (e.g., playing a selected video on display 112 via television set-top
                                             57

WO 2016/003509                                                              PCT/US2015/023089
box 104). User intent can thus be determined from speech input in a variety of ways
using displayed content and associated metadata as context.
[0185]        In some examples, virtual assistant query suggestions can be provided to a
user to, for example, inform the user of available queries, suggest content that the user
may enjoy, teach the user how to use the system, encourage the user to find additional
media content for consumption, or the like. In some examples, query suggestions can
include generic suggestions of possible commands (e.g., find comedies, show me the TV
guide, search for action movies, turn on closed captioning, etc.). In other examples,
query suggestions can include targeted suggestions related to displayed content (e.g., add
this show to a watch list, share this show via social media, show me the soundtrack of
this movie, show me the book that this guest is selling, show me the trailer for the movie
that guest is plugging, etc.), user preferences (e.g., closed captioning use, etc.), user
owned content, content stored on a user's device, notifications, alerts, a viewing history
of media content (e.g., recently displayed menu items, recently displayed scenes of a
show, recent actor appearances, etc.), or the like. Suggestions can be displayed on any
device, including on display 112 via television set-top box 104, on user device 102, or on
a display associated with remote control 106. In addition, suggestions can be determined
based on which devices are nearby and/or in communication with television set-top box
104 at a particular time (e.g., suggesting content from devices of the users in the room
watching TV at a particular time). In other examples, suggestions can be determined
based on a variety of other contextual information, including the time of day, crowd
sourced information (e.g., popular shows being watched at a given time), shows that are
live (e.g., live sporting events), a viewing history of media content (e.g., the last several
shows that were watched, a recently viewed set of search results, a recently viewed group
of media options, etc.), or any of a variety of other contextual information.
[0186]        FIG. 26 illustrates exemplary suggestions interface 2650 including content
based virtual assistant query suggestions 2652. In one example, query suggestions can be
provided in an interface such as interface 2650 in response to input received from a user
requesting suggestions. Input requesting query suggestions can be received, for example,
from user device 102 or remote control 106. In some examples, the input can include a
button press, a double click of a button, a menu selection, a voice command (e.g., show
                                               58

WO 2016/003509                                                               PCT/US2015/023089
me some suggestions, what can you do for me, what are some options, etc.), or the like
received at user device 102 or remote control 106. For instance, a user can double click a
physical button on remote control 106 to request query suggestions, or can double click a
physical or virtual button on user device 102 when viewing an interface associated with
television set-top box 104 to request query suggestions.
[0187]      Suggestions interface 2650 can be displayed over a moving image, such as
video 480, or over any other background content (e.g., a menu, a still image, a paused
video, etc.). As with other interfaces discussed herein, suggestions interface 2650 can be
animated to slide up from the bottom of display 112, and can occupy a minimal amount
of space while sufficiently conveying the desired information so as to limit interference
with video 480 in the background. In other examples, a larger interface of suggestions
can be provided when the background content is still (e.g., a paused video, a menu, an
image, etc.).
[0188]      In some examples, virtual assistant query suggestions can be determined
based on displayed media content or a viewing history of media content (e.g., a movie,
television show, sporting event, recently viewed show, recently viewed menu, recently
viewed scene of a movie, recent scene of a playing television episode, etc.). For
example, FIG. 26 illustrates content-based suggestions 2652, which can be determined
based on displayed video 480 shown in the background with characters 1910, 1912, and
1914 appearing on display 112. Metadata associated with displayed content (e.g.,
descriptive details of the media content) can also be used to determine query suggestions.
Metadata can include a variety of information associated with displayed content,
including a show title, a character list, an actor list, an episode description, a team roster,
a team ranking, a show synopsis, movie details, plot descriptions, director names,
producer names, times of actor appearance, sports standings, sports scores, genre, season
episode listing, related media content, or a variety of other associated information. For
example, metadata associated with video 480 can include the character names of
characters 1910, 1912, and 1914 along with the actresses who play those characters.
Metadata can also include a description of the plot of video 480, a description of a
previous or next episode (where video 480 is a television episode in a series), or the like.

WO 2016/003509                                                               PCT/US2015/023089
[0189]      FIG. 26 illustrates a variety of content-based suggestions 2652 that can be
shown in suggestions interface 2650 based on video 480 and metadata associated with
video 480. For example, character 1910 of video 480 can be named "Blanche," and the
character name can be used to formulate a query suggestion for information about the
character Blanche or the actress who plays that character (e.g., "Who is the actress that
plays Blanche?"). Character 1910 can be identified from metadata associated with video
480 (e.g., a character list, an actor list, times associated with actor appearances, etc.). In
other examples, facial recognition can be used to identify actresses and/or characters
appearing on display 112 at a given time. Various other query suggestions can be
provided associated with a character in the media itself, such as queries relating to a
character's role, profile, relationship to other characters, or the like.
[0190]      In another example, an actor or actress appearing on display 112 can be
identified (e.g., based on metadata and/or facial recognition), and query suggestions
associated with that actor or actress can be provided. Such query suggestions can include
role(s) played, acting awards, age, other media in which they appear, history, family
members, relationships, or any of a variety of other details about an actor or actress. For
example, character 1914 can be played by an actress named Whitney Davidson, and the
actress's name Whitney Davidson can be used to formulate a query suggestion to identify
other movies, television programs, or other media in which the actress Whitney Davidson
appears (e.g., "What else is Whitney Davidson in?").
[0191]      In other examples, details about a show can be used to formulate query
suggestions. An episode synopsis, plot summary, episode list, episode titles, series titles,
or the like can be used to formulate query suggestions. For example, a suggestion can be
provided to describe what happened in the last episode of a television program (e.g.,
"What happened in the last episode?"), to which the virtual assistant system can provide
as a response an episode synopsis from the prior episode identified based on the episode
currently shown on display 112 (and its associated metadata). In another example, a
suggestion can be provided to set up a recording for the next episode, which can be
accomplished by the system identifying the next episode based on the currently playing
episode shown on display 112. In yet another example, a suggestion can be provided to
get information about the current episode or show appearing on display 112, and the title

WO 2016/003509                                                             PCT/US2015/023089
of the show obtained from metadata can be used to formulate the query suggestion (e.g.,
"What is this episode of 'Their Show' about?" or "What is 'Their Show' about?").
[0192]      In another example, category, genre, rating, awards, descriptions, or the like
associated with displayed content can be used to formulate query suggestions. For
example, video 480 can correspond to a television program described as a comedy having
female lead characters. A query suggestion can be formulated from this information to
identify other shows with similar characteristics (e.g., "Find me other comedies with
female leads."). In other examples, suggestions can be determined based on user
subscriptions, content available for playback (e.g., content on television set-top box 104,
content on user device 102, content available for streaming, etc.), or the like. For
example, potential query suggestions can be filtered based on whether informational or
media results are available. Query suggestions that might not result in playable media
content or informational answers can be excluded, and/or query suggestions with readily
available informational answers or playable media content can be provided (or weighted
more heavily in determining which suggestions to provide). Displayed content and
associated metadata can thus be used in a variety of ways to determine query suggestions.
[0193]      FIG. 27 illustrates exemplary selection interface 2754 for confirming selection
of a suggested query. In some examples, users can select displayed query suggestions by
speaking the queries, selecting them with a button, navigating to them with a cursor, or
the like. In response to a selection, the selected suggestion can be briefly displayed in a
confirming interface, such as selection interface 2754. In one example, selected
suggestion 2756 can be animated to move from wherever it appeared in suggestions
interface 2650 to the position shown in FIG. 27 next to command receipt confirmation
490 (e.g., as shown by the arrow), and other unselected suggestions can be hidden from
the display.
[0194]      FIGS. 28A-28B illustrate exemplary virtual assistant answer interface 2862
based on a selected query. In some examples, informational answers to a selected query
can be displayed in an answer interface, such as answer interface 2862. In switching
from either suggestions interface 2650 or selection interface 2754, transition interface
2858 can be shown as illustrated in FIG. 28A. In particular, previously displayed content
                                              61

WO 2016/003509                                                              PCT/US2015/023089
within the interface can be scrolled upward out of the interface as the next content scrolls
upward from the bottom of display 112. Selected suggestion 2756, for example, can be
slid or scrolled upward until it disappears at the top edge of the virtual assistant interface,
and assistant result 2860 can be slid or scrolled upward from the bottom of display 112
until it arrives at the position shown in FIG. 28B.
[0195]        Answer interface 2862 can include informational answers and/or media results
responsive to a selected query suggestion (or responsive to any other query). For
example, in response to selected query suggestion 2756, assistant result 2860 can be
determined and provided. In particular, in response to a request for a synopsis of a prior
episode, the prior episode can be identified based on displayed content, and an associated
description or synopsis can be identified and provided to the user. In the illustrated
example, assistant result 2860 can describe a previous episode of the program
corresponding to video 480 on display 112 (e.g., "In episode 203 of 'Their Show,'
Blanche gets invited to a college psychology class as a guest speaker. Julia and Melissa
show up unannounced and cause a stir."). Informational answers and media results (e.g.,
selectable video links) can also be presented in any of the other ways discussed herein, or
results can be presented in various other ways (e.g., speaking answers aloud, playing
content immediately, showing an animation, displaying an image, etc.).
[0196]        In another example, a notification or alert can be used to determine virtual
assistant query suggestions. FIG. 29 illustrates a media content notification 2964
(although any notification can be taken into account in determining suggestions) and
suggestions interface 2650 with both notification-based suggestions 2966 and content
based suggestions 2652 (which can include some of the same concepts as discussed
above with reference to FIG. 26). In some examples, the content of a notification can be
analyzed to identify relevant media related names, titles, subjects, actions, or the like. In
the illustrated example, notification 2964 includes an alert notifying the user about
alternative media content available for display-specifically that a sporting event is live,
and the content of the game may be of interest to the user (e.g., "Team Zeta and Team
Alpha are tied with five minutes remaining in the game."). In some examples,
notifications can be displayed momentarily at the top of display 112. Notifications can
be slid down from the top of display 112 (as indicated by the arrow) into the position
                                               62

WO 2016/003509                                                               PCT/US2015/023089
shown in FIG. 29, displayed for a certain amount of time, and slid back up to disappear
again at the top of display 112.
[0197]       Notifications or alerts can notify the user of a variety of information, such as
available alternative media content (e.g., alternatives to what may be shown currently on
display 112), available live television programs, newly downloaded media content,
recently added subscription content, suggestions received from friends, receipt of media
sent from another device, or the like. Notifications can also be personalized based on a
household or an identified user watching media (e.g., identified based on user
authentication using account selections, voice recognition, passwords, etc.). In one
example, the system can interrupt a show and display a notification based on likely
desired content, such as displaying notification 2964 for a user who-based on a user
profile, favorite team(s), preferred sport(s), viewing history, and the like-can be likely
to desire the content of the notification. For example, sporting event scores, game status,
time remaining, and the like can be obtained from a sport data feed, news outlet, social
media discussions, or the like, and can be used to identify possible alternative media
content for notifying the user.
[0198]       In other examples, popular media content (e.g., across many users) can be
provided via alerts or notifications to suggest alternatives to currently viewed content
(e.g., notifying a user that a popular show or a show in a genre the user likes just started
or is otherwise available for viewing). In the illustrated example, the user might follow
one or both of Team Zeta and Team Alpha (or might follow soccer or a particular sport,
league, etc.). The system can determine that available live content matches the user's
preferences (e.g., a game on another channel matches a user's preferences, the game has
little time remaining, and the score is close). The system can then determine to alert the
user via notification 2964 of the likely desired content. In some examples, a user can
select notification 2964 (or a link within notification 2964) to switch to the suggested
content (e.g., using a remote control button, cursor, spoken request, etc.).
[0199]       Virtual assistant query suggestions can be determined based on notifications
by analyzing notification content to identify relevant media related terms, names, titles,
subjects, actions, or the like. The identified information can then be used to formulate
                                               63

WO 2016/003509                                                              PCT/US2015/023089
appropriate virtual assistant query suggestions, such as notification-based suggestions
2966 based on notification 2964. For example, a notification about an exciting end of a
live sporting event can be displayed. Should the user then request query suggestions,
suggestions interface 2650 can be displayed, including query suggestions to view the
sporting event, inquire about team statistics, or find content related to the notification
(e.g., change to the Zeta/Alpha game, what are team Zeta's stats, what other soccer
games are on, etc.). Based on the particular terms of interest identified in the notification,
various other query suggestions can likewise be determined and provided to the user.
[0200]       Virtual assistant query suggestions related to media content (e.g., for
consumption via television set-top box 104) can also be determined from content on a
user device, and suggestions can also be provided on a user device. In some examples,
playable device content can be identified on user devices that are connected to or in
communication with television set-top box 104. FIG. 30 illustrates user device 102 with
exemplary picture and video content in interface 1360. A determination can be made as
to what content is available for playback on a user device, or what content is likely to be
desired for playback. For example, playable media 3068 can be identified based on an
active application (e.g., a photos and videos application), or can be identified based on
stored content whether displayed on interface 1360 or not (e.g., content can be identified
from an active application in some examples or without being displayed at a given time
in other examples). Playable media 3068 can include, for example, video 1362, photo
album 1364, and photos 1366, each of which can include personal user content that can
be transmitted to television set-top box 104 for display or playback. In other examples,
any photo, video, music, game interface, application interface, or other media content
stored or displayed on user device 102 can be identified and used for determining query
suggestions.
[0201]       With playable media 3068 identified, virtual assistant query suggestions can
be determined and provided to the user. FIG. 31 illustrates exemplary TV assistant
interface 3170 on user device 102 with virtual assistant query suggestions based on
playable user device content and based on video content shown on a separate display
(e.g., display 112 associated with television set-top box 104). TV assistant interface 3170
can include a virtual assistant interface specifically for interacting with media content
                                              64

WO 2016/003509                                                              PCT/US2015/023089
and/or television set-top box 104. Users can request query suggestions on user device
102 by, for example, a double click of a physical button when viewing interface 3170.
Other inputs can similarly be used to indicate a request for query suggestions. As shown,
assistant greeting 3172 can introduce the provided query suggestions (e.g., "Here are
some suggestions for controlling your TV experience.").
[0202]       Virtual assistant query suggestions provided on user device 102 can include
suggestions based on a variety of source devices as well as general suggestions. For
example, device-based suggestions 3174 can include query suggestions based on content
stored on user device 102 (including content displayed on user device 102). Content
based suggestions 2652 can be based on content displayed on display 112 associated with
television set-top box 104. General suggestions 3176 can include general suggestions
that may not be associated with particular media content or a particular device with media
content.
[0203]       Device-based suggestions 3174 can be determined, for example, based on
playable content identified on user device 102 (e.g., videos, music, photographs, game
interfaces, application interfaces, etc.). In the illustrated example, device-based
suggestions 3174 can be determined based on playable media 3068 shown in FIG. 30.
For example, given that photo album 1364 was identified as playable media 3068, the
details of photo album 1364 can be used to formulate a query. The system can identify
the content as an album of multiple photos that can be shown in a slideshow, and can then
use the title of the album (in some instances) to formulate a query suggestion to show a
slideshow of the particular album of photos (e.g., "Show a slideshow of 'Graduation
Album' from your photos."). In some examples, the suggestion can include an indication
of the source of the content (e.g., "from your photos," "from Jennifer's phone," "from
Daniel's tablet," etc.). The suggestion can also use other details to refer to particular
content, such as a suggestion to view a photograph from a particular date (e.g., display
your photo from June 21st). In another example, video 1362 can be identified as playable
media 3068, and the title of the video (or other identifying information) can be used to
formulate a query suggestion to play the video (e.g., "Show 'Graduation Video' from
your videos.").
                                               65

WO 2016/003509                                                           PCT/US2015/023089
[0204]       In other examples, content available on other connected devices can be
identified and used to formulate virtual assistant query suggestions. For example, content
from each of two user devices 102 connected to a common television set-top box 104 can
be identified and used in formulating virtual assistant query suggestions. In some
examples, users can select which content to make visible to the system for sharing, and
can hide other content from the system so as not to include it in query suggestions or
otherwise make it available for playback.
[0205]       Content-based suggestions 2652 shown in interface 3170 of FIG. 31 can be
determined, for example, based on content displayed on display 112 associated with
television set-top box 104. In some examples, content-based suggestions 2652 can be
determined in the same manner as described above with reference to FIG. 26. In the
illustrated example, content-based suggestions 2652 shown in FIG. 31 can be based on
video 480 shown on display 112 (e.g., as in FIG. 26). In this manner, virtual assistant
query suggestions can be derived based on content that is displayed or available on any
number of connected devices. In addition to targeted suggestions, general suggestions
3176 can be predetermined and provided (e.g., show me the guide, what sports are on,
what's on channel three, etc.).
[0206]       FIG. 32 illustrates exemplary suggestions interface 2650 with connected
device-based suggestions 3275 along with content-based suggestions 2652 shown on
display 112 associated with television set-top box 104. In some examples, content-based
suggestions 2652 can be determined in the same manner as described above with
reference to FIG. 26. As noted above, virtual assistant query suggestions can be
formulated based on content on any number of connected devices, and the suggestions
can be provided on any number of connected devices. FIG. 32 illustrates connected
device-based suggestions 3275 that can be derived from content on user device 102. For
example, playable content can be identified on user device 102, such as photo and video
content shown in interface 1360 as playable media 3068 in FIG. 30. The identified
playable content on user device 102 can then be used to formulate suggestions that can be
displayed on display 112 associated with television set-top box 104. In some examples,
connected device-based suggestions 3275 can be determined in the same manner as
device-based suggestions 3174 described above with reference to FIG. 31. In addition, as
                                              66

WO 2016/003509                                                             PCT/US2015/023089
noted above, in some examples identifying source information can be included in a
suggestion, such as "from Jake's phone" as shown in connected device-based suggestions
3275. Virtual assistant query suggestions provided on one device can thus be derived
based on content from another device (e.g., displayed content, stored content, etc.). It
should be appreciated that a connected device can include a remote storage device
accessible to television set-top box 104 and/or user device 102 (e.g., accessing media
content stored in the cloud to formulate suggestions).
[0207]      It should be understood that any combination of virtual assistant query
suggestions from various sources can be provided in response to a request for
suggestions. For example, suggestions from various sources can be combined randomly,
or can be presented based on popularity, user preference, selection history, or the like.
Moreover, queries can be determined in a variety of other ways and presented based on a
variety of other factors, such as a query history, a user preference, a query popularity, or
the like. In addition, in some examples, query suggestions can be cycled automatically
by replacing displayed suggestions with new alternative suggestions after a delay. It
should further be understood that users can select displayed suggestions on any interface
by, for example, tapping on a touchscreen, speaking the query, selecting a query with
navigation keys, selecting a query with a button, selecting a query with a cursor, or the
like, and an associated response can then be provided (e.g., an informational and/or
media response).
[0208]      In any of the various examples, virtual assistant query suggestions can also be
filtered based on available content. For example, potential query suggestions that would
result in unavailable media content (e.g., no cable subscription) or that may not have an
associated informational answer can be disqualified as suggestions and held back from
being displayed. On the other hand, potential query suggestions that would result in
immediately playable media content to which the user has access can be weighted over
other potential suggestions or otherwise biased for display. In this manner, the
availability of media content for user viewing can also be used in determining virtual
assistant query suggestions for display.

WO 2016/003509                                                              PCT/US2015/023089
[0209]       In addition, in any of the various examples, pre-loaded query answers can be
provided instead of or in addition to suggestions (e.g., in suggestions interface 2650).
Such pre-loaded query answers can be selected and provided based on personal use
and/or current context. For example, a user watching a particular program can tap a
button, double-click a button, long-press a button, or the like to receive suggestions.
Instead of or in addition to query suggestions, context-based information can be provided
automatically, such as identifying a playing song or soundtrack (e.g., "This song is
Performance Piece"), identifying cast members of a currently playing episode (e.g.,
"Actress Janet Quinn plays Genevieve"), identifying similar media (e.g., "Show        Q is
similar to this"), or providing results of any of the other queries discussed herein.
[0210]       Moreover, affordances can be provided in any of the various interfaces for
users to rate media content to inform the virtual assistant of user preferences (e.g., a
selectable rating scale). In other examples, users can speak rating information as a
natural language command (e.g., "I love this," "I hate this," "I don't like this show," etc.).
In still other examples, in any of the various interfaces illustrated and described herein, a
variety of other functional and informational elements can be provided. For example,
interfaces can further include links to important functions and places, such as search
links, purchase links, media links, and the like. In another example, interfaces can further
include recommendations of what else to watch next based on currently playing content
(e.g., selecting similar content). In yet another example, interfaces can further include
recommendations of what else to watch next based on personalized taste and/or recent
activity (e.g., selecting content based on user ratings, user-entered preferences, recently
watched programs, etc.). In still other examples, interfaces can further include
instructions for user interactions (e.g., "Press and hold to talk to the Virtual Assistant,"
"Tap once to get suggestions," etc.). In some examples, providing pre-loaded answers,
suggestions, or the like can provide an enjoyable user experience while also making
content readily available to a wide variety of users (e.g., to users of various skill levels
irrespective of language or other control barriers).
[0211]       FIG. 33 illustrates exemplary process 3300 for suggesting virtual assistant
interactions for controlling media content (e.g., virtual assistant queries). At block 3302,
media content can be displayed on a display. For example, as shown in FIG. 26, video
                                               68

WO 2016/003509                                                             PCT/US2015/023089
480 can be displayed on display 112 via television set-top box 104, or interface 1360 can
be displayed on touchscreen 246 of user device 102 as shown in FIG. 30. At block 3304,
an input can be received from a user. The input can include a request for virtual assistant
query suggestions. The input can include a button press, a double click of a button, a
menu selection, a spoken query for suggestions, or the like.
[0212]       At block 3306, virtual assistant queries can be determined based on the media
content and/or a viewing history of media content. For example, virtual assistant queries
can be determined based on a displayed program, menu, application, list of media
content, notification, or the like. In one example, content-based suggestions 2652 can be
determined based on video 480 and associated metadata as described with reference to
FIG. 26. In another example, notification-based suggestions 2966 can be determined
based on notification 2964 as described with reference to FIG. 29. In yet another
example, device-based suggestions 3174 can be determined based on playable media
3068 on user device 102 as described with reference to FIG. 30 and FIG. 31. In still
other examples, connected device-based suggestions 3275 can be determined based on
playable media 3068 on user device 102 as described with reference to FIG. 32.
[0213]       Referring again to process 3300 of FIG. 33, at block 3308, the virtual assistant
queries can be displayed on the display. For example, determined query suggestions can
be displayed as shown in and described with reference to FIGS. 26, 27, 29, 31, and 32.
As discussed above, query suggestions can be determined and displayed based on a
variety of other information. Moreover, virtual assistant query suggestions provided on
one display can be derived based on content from another device with another display.
Targeted virtual assistant query suggestions can thus be provided to users, thereby
assisting users to learn of potential queries as well as providing desirable content
suggestions, among other benefits.
[0214]       In addition, in any of the various examples discussed herein, various aspects
can be personalized for a particular user. User data, including contacts, preferences,
location, favorite media, and the like, can be used to interpret voice commands and
facilitate user interaction with the various devices discussed herein. The various
processes discussed herein can also be modified in various other ways according to user
                                               69

preferences, contacts, text, usage history, profile data, demographics, or the like. In
addition, such preferences and settings can be updated over time based on user
interactions (e.g., frequently uttered commands, frequently selected applications, etc.).
Gathering and use of user data that is available from various sources can be used to
improve the delivery to users of invitational content or any other content that may be of
interest to them. The present disclosure contemplates that in some instances, this
gathered data can include personal information data that uniquely identifies or can be
used to contact or locate a specific person. Such personal information data can include
demographic data, location-based data, telephone numbers, email addresses, home
addresses, or any other identifying information.
[0215]       The present disclosure recognizes that the use of such personal information
data, in the present technology, can be used to the benefit of users. For example, the
personal information data can be used to deliver targeted content that is of greater interest
to the user. Accordingly, use of such personal information data enables calculated
control of the delivered content. Further, other uses for personal information data that
benefit the user are also contemplated by the present disclosure.
[0216]       The present disclosure further contemplates that the entities responsible for
the collection, analysis, disclosure, transfer, storage, or other use of such personal
information data will comply with well-established privacy policies and/or privacy
practices. In particular, such entities should implement and consistently use privacy
policies and practices that are generally recognized as meeting or exceeding industry or
governmental requirements for maintaining personal information data as private and
secure. For example, personal information from users should be collected for legitimate
and reasonable uses of the entity and not shared or sold outside of those legitimate uses.
Further, such collection should occur only after receiving the informed consent of the
users. Additionally, such entities would take any needed steps for safeguarding and
securing access to such personal information data and ensuring that others with access to
the personal information data adhere to their privacy policies and procedures. Further,
such entities can subject themselves to evaluation by third parties to certify their
adherence to widely accepted privacy policies and practices.

[0217]      Despite the foregoing, the present disclosure also contemplates examples in
which users selectively block the use of, or access to, personal information data. That is,
the present disclosure contemplates that hardware and/or software elements can be
