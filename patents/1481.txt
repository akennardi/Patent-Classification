                                CROSS-REFERENCES TO RELATED APPLICATIONS
 [0001]             This application is a divisional application of Australian Application No.

                                                       BACKGROUND
 [0002]             The present disclosure relates generally to crystalline solid forms of the antiviral
compound 4-amino-2-butoxy-8-(3-(pyrrolidin-1-ylmethyl)benzyl)-7,8-dihydropteridin
6(5H)-one, processes for making the forms, and their therapeutic methods of use.
 [0003]             The innate immune system provides the body with a first line defense against
invading pathogens. In an innate immune response, an invading pathogen is recognized by
a germline-encoded receptor, the activation of which initiates a signaling cascade that leads
to the induction of cytokine expression. Innate immune system receptors have broad
specificity, recognizing molecular structures that are highly conserved among different
pathogens. One family of these receptors is known as Toll-like receptors (TLRs), due to
their homology with receptors that were first identified and named in Drosophila, and are
present in cells such as macrophages, dendritic cells, and epithelial cells.
 [0004]             There are at least ten different TLRs in mammals. Ligands and corresponding
signaling cascades have been identified for some of these receptors. For example, TLR2 is
activated by the lipoprotein of bacteria (e.g., E. coli.), TLR3 is activated by double
stranded RNA, TLR4 is activated by lipopolysaccharide (i.e., LPS or endotoxin) of Gram
negative bacteria (e.g., Salmonella and E. coli 0157:H7), TLR5 is activated by flagellin of
motile bacteria (e.g., Listeria), TLR7 recognizes and responds to imiquimod and TLR9 is
activated by unmethylated CpG sequences of pathogen DNA. The stimulation of each of
these receptors leads to activation of the transcription factor NF-KB, and other signaling
molecules that are involved in regulating the expression of cytokine genes, including those
encoding tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-4 interleukin -1 (IL-1), and certain
chemokines. Agonists of TLR-7 are immunostimulants and induce the production of
endogenous interferon-a in vivo.

   WO 2016/044182                                                          PCT/US2015/050037
 100051    There are a number of diseases, disorders, and conditions linked to TLRs such that
therapies using a TLR agonist are believed promising, including but not limited to melanoma,
non-small cell lung carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma, renal cell
carcinoma, myeloma, allergic rhinitis, asthma, COPD, ulcerative colitis, hepatic fibrosis, and
viral infections such as HBV, Flaviviridae viruses, HCV, HPV, RSV, SARS, HIV, or
influenza.
[00061    The treatment of Flaviviridaevirus infections with TLR agonists is particularly
promising. Viruses of the Flaviviridaefamily comprise at least three distinguishable genera
including pesiiviruses,iaviviruses,and hepaciviruses(Calisher, et al,, J. Gen Virol., 1993,
70, 37-43). While pestiviruses cause many economically important animal diseases such as
bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), classical swine fever virus (CSFV, hog cholera) and
border disease of sheep (BDV), their importance in human disease is less well characterized
(Moennig, V,, el al., Adv. Vir. Res. 1992, 48, 53-98). Flaviviruses are responsible for
important human diseases such as dengue fever and yellow fever while hepacivirusescause
hepatitis C virus infections in humans. Other important viral infections caused by the
Flaviviridaefamily include West Nile virus (WNV) Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), tick
borne encephalitis virus, Junjin virus., Murray Valley encephalitis, St Louis encephalitis,
Omsk hemorrhagic fever virus and Zika virus. Combined, infections from the Fiaviviridae
virus family cause significant mortality, morbidity and economic losses throughout the world.
Therefore, there is a need to develop effective treatments for Flavt'iviridaevirus infections.
[00071    The hepatitis C virus (HCV) is the leading cause of chronic liver disease worldwide
(Boyer, N. et al.    lepatol. 32:98-112, 2000) so a significant focus of current antiviral
research is directed toward the development of improved methods of treatment of chronic
HCV infections in humans (Di Besceglie, A.M. and Bacon, B. R., Scientific American, Oct.:
80-85, (1999); Gordon, C. P., et at, J. Med. Chein. 2005, 48, 1-20; Maradpour, D.; et al.
Nat Rev, Micro. 2007, 5(6), 453-463). A number of HCV treatments are reviewed by
Bynock et al. in Antiviral Chemistry & Chemotherapy, 11:2; 79-95 (2000). Currently, there
are several antiviral compounds, ribavirin, a nucleoside analog, interferon-alpha (a) (IFN),
and sofosbuvir, another nucleoside analog, that are used for the treatment of chronic HCV
infections in humans. Ribavirin alone is not effective in reducing viral RNA levels, has
significant toxicity, and is known to induce anemia. The combination of IFN and ribavirin
has been reported to be effective in the management of chronic hepatitis C (Scott, L. J, et al

   WO 2016/044182                                                            PCT/US2015/050037
Drugs 2002, 62, 507-556) but less than half the patients given this treatment show a
persistent benefit.
 [0008]    HCV is recognized by innate virus-sensing mechanisms that induce a rapid lFN
response (Dustin, et al, Annu. Rev.     munol. 2007, 25, 71 -99). It is likely that the sources of
the IFN are, at least, the infected hepatocytes and particularly the plasmacytoid dendritic cells
(pDC) that highly express TLR 7 receptors and secrete high amounts of IFN. Horsmans, et
al. (Hepatology, 2005, 42, 724-731), demonstrated that a once daily 7-day treatment with the
TLR 7 agonist isatoribine reduces plasma virus concentrations in HCV infected patients.
Lee, et al.(Proc, Nal. Acad. Sci. USA, 2006, 103, 1828-1833), demonstrated that TLR 7
stimulation can induce HCV immunity by both an IFN and IFN-independent mechanisms.
These workers also revealed that TLR 7 is expressed in normal as well as HCV infected
hepatocytes. These combined results support the conclusion that stimulation of TLR 7
receptors, such as through the administration of a TLR 7 agonist, is a viable mechanism or
effectively treating natural HCV infections. Given the need for more effective treatments for
HCV infections, there is a need to develop safe and therapeutically effective TLR 7 agonists.
[0009]     Similarly, despite the existence of efficient vaccines, hepatitis B virus (HBV)
infection remains a major public health problem worldwide with 400 million chronic carriers.
These infected patients are exposed to a risk of developing liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular
carcinoma (Lee, W. M. 1997, N, Eng. J Med., 337, 1733-1745). Currently, there are believed
to be approximately 1.25 million chronic hepatitis B carriers just in the United States, with
200,000 people newly infected each year by contact with blood or body fluids.
[00101     Hepatitis B virus is second to tobacco as a cause of human cancer, The mechanism
by which HBV induces cancer is unknown, although it is postulated that may directly trigger
tumor development, or indirectly trigger tumor development through chronic inflammation,
cirrhosis, and cell regeneration associated with the infection.
100111     Hepatitis B virus has reached epidemic levels worldwide. After a two to six month
incubation period in which the host is unaware of the infection, HBV infection can lead to
acute hepatitis and liver damage, that causes abdominal pain, jaundice, and elevated blood
levels of certain enzymes. H-BV can cause fulminant hepatitis, a rapidly progressive, often
fatal form of the disease in which massive sections of the liver are destroyed. Patients
typically recover from acute viral hepatitis. in some patients, however, high levels of viral
antigen persist in the blood for an extended, or indefinite, period, causing a chronic infection.
                                                  3

   WO 2016/044182                                                           PCT/US2015/050037
Chronic infections can lead to chronic persistent hepatitis. Patients infected with chronic
persistent HBV are most common in developing countries. By mid-1991, there were
approximately 225 million chronic carriers of HBV in Asia alone, and worldwide, almost 300
million carriers. Chronic persistent hepatitis can cause fatigue, cirrhosis of the liver, and
hepatoceliular carcinoma, a primary liver cancer.
 [00121   In western industrialized countries, high risk groups for HBV infection include
those in contact with HBV carriers or their blood samples. The epidemiology of HBV is in
fact very similar to that of -IIV, which accounts for why HBV infection is common among
patients with AIDS or HIV-associated infections. However, HBV is more contagious than
HIV. To ameliorate suffering and to prolong the lives of infected hosts new compounds and
methods of treating AIDS and attacking the HIV virus continue to be sought,
 10013]   The compound 4-amino-2-butoxy-843 -(pyrrolidin- 1-ylmethyl )benzy)-7,8
dihydropteridin-6(SH)-one, designated herein as Compound I, as described for example in
WO 2010/077613 and USPN 8,367,670, has been reported to be an inhibitor of toll-like
receptor 7. Moreover, Compound I is being investigated for use in treating HBV and HIV,
However, Compound I was not previously known in any crystalline form.

V.       PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS
10165]    The solid forms of Compound I provided herein can be administered in the form of
pharmaceutical compositions. This disclosure provides pharmaceutical compositions that
contain, as the active ingredient, one or more of the solid fonns of Compound I described or a
pharmaceutically acceptable salt or ester thereof and one or more pharnaceutically
acceptable excipients, carriers, including inert solid diluents and fillers, diluents, including
sterile aqueous solution and various organic solvents, permeation enhancers, solubilizers and
adjuvants. The pharmaceutical compositions may be administered alone or in combination
with other therapeutic agents (as indicated in the Combination Therapy section below). Such
compositions are prepared in a manner well known in the pharmaceutical art (see, e.g.,
Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mace Publishing Co., Philadelphia, PA 17th Ed.
(1985); and Moden Phannaceutics, Marcel Dekker, Inc. 3rd Ed. (0.S. Banker & C.T.
Rhodes, Eds.)
[0166]    The pharmaceutical compositions may be administered in either single or multiple
doses by any of the accepted modes of administration of agents having similar utilities, for
example as described in those patents and patent applications incorporated by reference,
including rectal, buccal, intranasal and transdermal routes, by intra-arterial injection,
intravenously, intraperitoneally, parenterally, intramuscularly, subcutaneously orally,
topically, as an inhalant or via an impregnated or coated device such as a stent, for example
or an artery-inserted cylindrical polymer.
[0167]    One mode for administration is parenteral, particularly by injection. The forms in
which the novel compositions of the present disclosure may be incorporated for
administration by injection include aqueous or oil suspensions or emulsions, with sesame oil,
corn oil, cottonseed oil or peanut oil, as well as elixirs, mannitol, dextrose or a sterile aqueous
solution and similar pharmaceutical vehicles. Aqueous solutions in saline are also
conventionally used for injection, but less preferred in the context of the present disclosure.

   WO 2016/044182                                                            PCT/US2015/050037
Ethanol, glycerol, propylene glycol, liquid polyethylene glycol, and the like (and suitable
mixtures thereof), cyclodextrin derivatives, and vegetable oils may also be employed. The
proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating, such as lecithin, by
the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersion and by the use of
surfactants. The prevention of the action of microorganisms can be brought about by various
antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, sorbic acid,
thimerosal'. and the like.
[0168]     Sterile injectable solutions are prepared by incorporating a compound according to
the present disclosure in the required amount in the appropriate solvent with various other
ingredients as enumerated above, as required, followed by filtered sterilization. Generally,
dispersions are prepared by incorporating the various sterilized active ingredients into a
sterile vehicle which contains the basic dispersion medium and the required other ingredients
from those enumerated above. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile
injectable solutions, the general methods of preparation are vacuum-drying and freeze-drying
techniques which yield a powder of the active ingredient plus any additional desired
ingredient from a previously sterile-filtered solution thereof.
[01691     Oral administration is another route for administration of compounds in accordance
with the disclosure. Administration may be via capsule or enteric coated tablets or the like.
In making the pharmaceutical compositions that include at least one compound described
herein, the active ingredient is usually diluted by an excipient and/or enclosed within such a
carrier that can be in the form of a capsule, sachet, paper or other container. When the
excipient serves as a diluent, it can be in the form of a solid, semi-solid or liquid material (as
above), which acts as a vehicle, carrier or medium for the active ingredient. Thus, the
compositions can be in the form of tablets, pills, powders, lozenges, sachets, cachets, elixirs,
suspensions, emulsions, solutions, syrups, aerosols (as a solid or in a liquid medium),
ointments containing, for example, up to 10% by weight of the active compound, soft and
hard gelatin capsules, sterile injectable solutions and sterile packaged powders.
[01701     Some examples of suitable excipients include lactose, dextrose, sucrose, sorbitol,
mannitol, starches, gum acacia, calcium phosphate, alginates, tragacanth, gelatin, calcium
silicate, microcrystalline cellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone, cellulose, sterile water, syrup and
methyl cellulose. The fornulations can additionally include: lubricating agents such as tale,
magnesium stearate and mineral oil; wetting agents; emulsifying and suspending agents;

preserving agents such as methyl and propyilhydroxy-benzoates; sweetening agents; and
flavoring agents.
 [01711   The compositions of the disclosure can be formulated so as to provide quick,
sustained or delayed release of the active ingredient after administration to the patient by
employing procedures known in the art. Controlled release drug delivery systems for oral
administration include osmotic pump systems and dissolutional systems containing polyner
coated reservoirs or drug-polymer matrix formulations. Examples of controlled release
systems are given in U.S. Patent Nos, 3,845,770; 4,326,525; 4,902,514; and 5,616,345.
Another formulation for use in the methods of the present disclosure employs transdermal
delivery devices ("patches"). Such transdermal patches may be used to provide continuous or
discontinuous infusion of the compounds of the present disclosure in controlled amounts.
The construction and use of tra nsdennal patches for the delivery of pharmaceutical agents is
well known in the art. See, eg., U.S. Patent Nos. 5,023,252, 4,992,445 and 5,001,139. Such
patches may be constructed for continuous, pulsatile or on demand delivery of
pharmaceutical agents.
 10172]   In some embodiments, the compositions are formulated in a unit dosage form. The
term "unit dosage forms" refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages for
human subjects and other mammals, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active
material calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect, in association with a suitable
pharmaceutical excipient (eg., a tablet, capsule, ampoule). The compounds are generally
administered in a pharmaceutically effective amount. In some embodiments, each dosage
unit contains from I mg to 2 g of a compound described herein and for parenteral
administration, in some embodiments, from 0.1 to 700 mng of a compound a compound
described herein, It will be understood, however, that the amount of the compound actually
administered usually will be determined by a physician, in the light of the relevant
circumstances, including the condition to be treated, the chosen route of administration, the
actual compound administered and its relative activity, the age, weight and response of the
individual patient, the severity of the patient's symptoms, and the like.
 [01731   For preparing solid compositions such as tablets, the principal active ingredient is
mixed with a pharmaceutical excipient to form a solid prefonnulation composition containing
a homogeneous mixture of a compound of the present disclosure. When referring to these
preformulation compositions as homogeneous, it is meant that the active ingredient is
                                                 43

   WO 2016/044182                                                           PCT/US2015/050037
dispersed evenly throughout the composition so that the composition may be readily
subdivided into equally effective unit dosage forns such as tablets, pills and capsules.
 [01741     The tablets or pills of the present disclosure may be coated or otherwise
compounded to provide a dosage form affording the advantage of prolonged action or to
protect from the acid conditions of the stomach. For example, the tablet or pill can comprise
an inner dosage and an outer dosage component, the latter being in the form of an envelope
over the former, The two components can be separated by an enteric layer that serves to
resist disintegration in the stomach and permit the inner component to pass intact into the
duodenum or to be delayed in release. A variety of materials can be used for such enteric
layers or coatings., such materials including a number of polymeric acids and mixtures of
polymeric acids with such materials as shellac, cetyl alcohol and cellulose acetate.
10175]      Compositions for inhalation or insufflation include solutions and suspensions in
pharmaceutically acceptable, aqueous or organic solvents or mixtures thereof and powders.
The liquid or solid compositions may contain suitable pharmaceutically acceptable excipients
as described supra. In some embodiments, the compositions are administered by the oral or
nasal respiratory route for local or systemic effect. Compositions in preferably
pharmaceutically acceptable solvents may be nebulized by use of inert gases. Nebulized
solutions may be inhaled directly from the nebulizing device or the nebulizing device may be
attached to a facemask tent or intermittent positive pressure breathing machine. Solution,
suspension or powder compositions may be administered, in some embodiments orally or
nasally, from devices that deliver the fofrnulation in an appropriate manner.
[01761      In one embodiment, this disclosure relates to a pharmaceutical composition
comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient or carrier and a therapeutically effective
amount of the compound of Compound I as described above or a pharmaceutically acceptable
salt, ester, prodrug, stereoisomer or hydrate thereof.

 101781     As used herein, an "agonist" is a substance that stimulates its binding partner,
typically a receptor. Stimulation is defined in the context of the particular assay, or may be
apparent in the literature from a discussion herein that makes a comparison to a factor or
substance that is accepted as an "agonist" or an "antagonist" of the particular binding partner
under substantially similar circumstances as appreciated by those of skill in the art.
Stimulation may be defined with respect to an increase in a particular effect or function that is
induced by interaction of the agonist or partial agonist with a binding partner and can include
allosteric effects.
 [0179]     As used herein, an "antagonist" is a substance that inhibits its binding partner,
typically a receptor. Inhibition is defined in the context of the particular assay, or may be
apparent in the literature from a discussion herein that makes a comparison to a factor or
substance that is accepted as an "agonist" or an "antagonist" of the particular binding partner
under substantially similar circumstances as appreciated by those of skill in the art.
Inhibition may be defined with respect to a decrease in a particular effect or function that is
induced by interaction of the antagonist with a binding partner, and can include allosteric
effects,
 [0180j     As used herein, a "partial agonist" or a "partial antagonist" is a substance that
provides a level of stimulation or inhibition, respectively, to its binding partner that is not
 filly or completely agonistic or antagonistic, respectively. It will be recognized that
 stimulation, and hence, inhibition is defined intrinsically for any substance or category of
 substances to be defined as agonists, antagonists, or partial agonists.
 101811     As used herein, "intrinsic activity" or "efficacy" relates to some measure of
biological effectiveness of the binding partner complex. With regard to receptor
pharmacology, the context in which intrinsic activity or efficacy should be defined will
 depend on the context of the binding partner (e.g., receptor/ligand) complex and the
 consideration of an activity relevant to a particular biological outcome. For example, in some
 circumstances, intrinsic activity may vary depending on the particular second messenger
 system involved. Where such contextually specific evaluations are relevant, and how they
 might be relevant in the context of the present invention, will be apparent to one of ordinary
 skill in the art.
 [01821     As used herein, modulation of a receptor includes agonism, partial agonism,
 antagonism, partial antagonism, or inverse agonism of a receptor.

[0189]    Treatment in accordance with the present invention typically results in the
stimulation of an immune response against HBV or H CV in a human being infected with
HBV or HCV, respectively, and a consequent reduction in the viral load of -IBV or HCV in
the infected person. Examples of inimune responses include production of antibodies (e.g.,
IgG antibodies) and/or production of cytokines, such as interferons, that modulate the activity
of the immune system. The immune system response can be a newly induced response, or
can be boosting of an existing immune response. In particular, the immune system response
can be seroconversion against one or more HBV or HCV antigens.
[01901    The viral load can be determined by measuring the amount of HBV DNA or HCV
DNA present in the blood. For example, blood serurn HBV DNA can be quantified using the
Roche COBAS Amnplicor Monitor PCR assay (version 2.0; lower limit of quantification, 300
copies/mL [57 IU/mL]) and the Quantiplex bDNA assay (lower limit of quantification, 0.7
MEq/mL.,; Baver Diagnostics, formerly Chiron Diagnostics, Emeryville, CA). The amount of
antibodies against specific HBV or H1CV antigens (e.g, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAG))
can be measured using such art-recognized techniques as enzyme-linked immunoassays and
enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assays. For example, the amount of antibodies against
specific HBV or 1CV antigens can be measured using the Abbott AxSYM microparticle
enzyme immunoassay system (Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago, IL).
10191.]   Compound I can be administered by any useful route and means, such as by oral or
parenteral (e.g., intravenous) administration. Therapeutically effective amounts of Compound
I are from about 0.00001 mg/kg body weight per day to about 10 mg/kg body weight per day,
such as from about 0,0001 mg/kg body weight per day to about 10 mg/kg body weight per
day, or such as from about 0.001 mg/kg body weight per day to about 1 mg/kg body weight

body weight per day, or such as from about 0.3 jig to about 30 mg per day, or such as from
about 30 pg to about 300 pg per day,
101921    Therapeutically effective amounts of Compound I are also from about 0.01 mg per
dose to about 1000 mg per dose, such as from about 0.01 mg per dose to about 100 mg per
dose, or such as from about 0. 1 mig per dose to about 100 mg per dose, or such as from about
1 mg per dose to about 100 mg per dose, or such as from about I mg per dose to about 10 mg
per dose. Other therapeutically effective amounts of Compound I are about I mg per dose, or
about 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90. 95,
or about 100 tug per dose. Other therapeutically effective amounts of Compound I are about
100 mg per dose, or about 125, 150, 175, 200, 225, 250, 275, 300, 350, 400, 450, or about
500 tug per dose. A single dose can be administered hourly, daily, or weekly. For example, a
single dose can be administered once every 1 hour, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12. 16 or once every 24
hours. A single dose can also be administered once every I day, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or once every 7
days. A single dose can also be administered once every I week, 2, 3, or once every 4 weeks.
A single dose can also be administered once every month.
[01931    The frequency of dosage of Compound I will be determined by the needs of the
individual patient and can be, for example, once per day or twice, or more times, per day
Administration of Compound I continues for as long as necessary to treat the HBV or HCV
infection. For example, Compound I can be administered to a human being infected with
HBV or HCV for a period of from 20 days to 180 days or, for example, for a period of from
20 days to 90 days or, for example, for a period of from 30 days to 60 days.
[01941    Administration can be intenittent, with a period of several or more days during
which a patient receives a daily dose of Compound I, followed by a period of several or more
days during which a patient does not receive a daily dose of Compound 1. For example, a
patient can receive a dose of Compound I every other day, or three times per week. Again by
way of example, a patient can receive a dose of Compound I each day for a period of from I
to 14 days, followed by a period of 7 to 21 days during which the patient does not receive a
dose of Compound I, followed by a subsequent period (e.g., from I to 14 days) during which
the patient again receives a daily dose of Compound I. Alternating periods of administration

administered with one or more additional therapeutic agent(s) to a human being infected with
hepatitis B virus or hepatitis C virus. The additional therapeutic agent(s) can be administered
to the infected human being at the same time as the crystalline form of Compound I, or before
or after administration of the crystalline form of Compound 1 In some embodiments, the
present invention provides a crystalline fbrm of Compound 1, for use in a method of treating
or preventing a hepatitis B viral infection, wherein the crystalline form of Compound I is

101961     In another aspect, the present invention provides a method for ameliorating a
symptom associated with an HBV infection or HCV infection, wherein the method comprises
administering to a human subject infected with hepatitis B virus or hepatitis C virus a
therapeutically effective amount of the crystalline form of Compound I, wherein the
therapeutically effective amount is sufficient to ameliorate a symptom associated with the
HBV infection or HCV infection. Such symptoms include the presence of HBV virus
particles (or 1-ICV virus particles) in the blood, liver inflammation, jaundice. muscle aches,
weakness and tiredness.
101971     In some embodiments, the present invention provides a crystalline fonn of

 [0198]   In a further aspect, the present invention provides a method for reducing the rate of
progression of a hepatitis B viral infection, or a hepatitis C virus infection, in a human being,
wherein the method comprises administering to a human subject infected with hepatitis B
virus or hepatitis C virus a therapeutically effective amount of Compound I, or a
pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, wherein the therapeutically effective amount is
sufficient to reduce the rate of progression of the hepatitis B viral infection or hepatitis C
viral infection. The rate of progression of the infection can be followed by measuring the
amount of HBV virus particles or HCV virus particles in the blood.
101991     In another aspect, the present invention provides a method for reducing the viral
load associated with HBV infection or H:CV infection, wherein the method comprises
administering to a human being infected with HBV or HCV a therapeutically effective
amount of Compound I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, wherein the
therapeutically effective amount is sufficient to reduce the HBV viral load or the HCV viral
load in the human being.
102001    In a further aspect, the present invention provides a method of inducing or boosting
an immune response against Hepatitis B virus or H epatitis C virus in a human being, wherein
the method comprises administering a therapeutically effective amount of Compound I, or a
pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, to the human being, wherein a new immune
response against Hlepatitis B virus or Hepatitis C virus is induced in the human being, or a
preexisting immune response against Hepatitis B virus or Hepatitis C virus is boosted in the
human being. Serocon version with respect to HBV or HCV can be induced in the human
being. Examples of immune responses include production of antibodies. such as IgG
antibody molecules, and/or production of cytokine molecules that modulate the activity of
one or more components of the human immune system.
[02011    Induction of seroconversion against HCV or H BV in patients chronically infected
with either of these viruses is an unexpected property of Compound . In clinical practice, an
I-IBV patient, or HCV patient, is treated with Compound 1, alone or in combination with one
or more other therapeutic agents, until an immune response against HBV or HCV is induced
or enhanced and the viral load of I-IBV or HCV is reduced. Thereafter, although the H"B"V or
                                                 50

 HCV virus may persist in a latent form in the patient' s body, treatment with Compound I can
 be stopped, and the patient's own immune system is capable of suppressing further viral
 replication. In patients treated in accordance with the present invention and who are already
 receiving treatment with an antiviral agent that suppresses replication of the HBV virus or
 HCV virus, there may be little or no detectable viral particles in the body of the patient during
 treatment with the antiviral agent(s). In these patients, seroconversion will be evident when
the antiviral agent(s) is no longer administered to the patient and there is no increase in the
viral load of H-BV or HCV.
 [02021    In the practice of the present invention, an immune response is induced against one
or more antigens of HBV or HCV. For example, an immune response can be induced against
the HBV surface antigen (HBsAg), or against the small form of the HBV surface antigen
(small S antigen), or against the medium form of the HBV surface antigen (medium S
antigen), or against a combination thereof. Again by way of example, an immune response
can be induced against the HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) and also against other HBV
derived antigens, such as the core polymerase or x-protein.
 102031    Induction of an immune response against HCV or HBV can be assessed using any
technique that is known by those of skill in the art for determining whether an immune
response has occurred. Suitable methods of detecting an immune response for the present
invention include, among others, detecting a decrease in viral load in a subject's serum, such
as by measuring the amount of 1113V DNA or HCV DNA in a subject's blood using a PCR
assay, and/or by measuring the amount of anti-H.BV antibodies, or anti-HCV antibodies, in
the subject's blood using a method such as an ELISA.
[02041     Additionally, the compounds of this invention may be useful in the treatment of
cancer or tumors (including dysplasias, such as uterine dysplasia). These includes
hematological malignancies, oral carcinomas (for example of the lip, tongue or pharynx),
digestive organs (for example esophagus, stomach, small intestine, colon, large intestine, or
rectum), liver and biliary passages, pancreas, respiratory system such as larynx or lung (small
cell and non-small cell), bone, connective tissue, skin (e.g., melanoma), breast, reproductive
organs (uterus, cervix, testicles, ovary, or prostate), urinary tract (e.g., bladder or kidney),
brain and endocrine glands such as the thyroid. In summary, the compounds of this invention
are employed to treat any neoplasm, including not only hematologic malignancies but also
solid tumors of all kinds.

 102051    Hematological malignancies are broadly defined as proliferative disorders of blood
cells and/or their progenitors, in which these cells proliferate in an uncontrolled manner.
Anatomically, the hematologic malignancies are divided into two primary groups:
lymphomas -- malignant masses of lymphoid cells, primarily but not exclusively in lymph
nodes, and leukemias - neoplasm derived typically from lymphoid or myeloid cells and
primarily affecting the bone marrow and peripheral blood, The lymphomas can be sub
divided into Hodgkin's Disease and Non-H odgkin's lymphoma (NHL). The latter group
comprises several distinct entities, which can be distinguished clinically (e.g. aggressive
lymphoma, indolent lymphoma), histologically (e.g. follicular lymphoma, mantle cell
lymphoma) or based on the origin of the malignant cell (eg. B lymphocyte, T lymphocyte).
Leukemias and related malignancies include acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), chronic
myelogenous leukemia (CML), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (A LL) and chronic
lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Other hematological malignancies include the plasma cell
dyscrasias including multiple myeloma, and the myclodysplastic syndromes.

 [02561    The solid forms (polymoriphs, solvates and hydrates) of Conpound I were
 characterized by a variety of the following methods.
 [0257]    X-ray Powder Diffraction (XRPD). The Rigaku Smart-Lab® X-ray diffraction
 system was configured for reflection BraggBrentano geometry using a line source X-ray
beam. The x-ray source is a Cu Long Fine Focus tube that was operated at 40 kV and 44 mA.
That source provides an incident beam profile at the sample that changes front a narrow line
at high angles to a broad rectangle at low angles. Beam conditioning slits were used on the
 line X-ray source to ensure that the maximum beam size is less than 10 mm both along the
line and normal to the line. The Bragg-Brentano geometry is a parafocusing geometry
controlled by passive divergence and receiving slits with the sample itself acting as the
focusing component for the optics. The inherent resolution of Bragg-Brentano geometry is
governed in part by the diffractometer radius and the width of the receiving slit used.
Typically, the Rigaku Smart-L'ab is operated to give peak widths of 0.1 '20 or less. The axial
divergence of the X-ray beam is controlled by 5.0-degree Soller slits in both the incident and
diffracted beam paths.
[0258]    Powder samples were prepared in a low background Si holder using light manual
pressure to keep the sample surfaces flat and level with the reference surface of the sample
holder. The single-crystal, Si, low-background holder has a small circular recess (7mm
diameter and about 1 mm depth) that holds between 5 and 10mg of powdered material. Each
sample was analyzed from 2 to 40     020 using a continuous scan of 3 020 per minute with an
effective step size of 0.02 020.
[0259]    Solubility Estinations. Solubilities were estimated by treating a weighed sample of
Compound I with measured aliquots of the test solvent at ambient temperature, with shaking
and/or sonication between aliquots. Dissolution was determined by visual inspection.
Solubility numbers were calculated by dividing the total amount of solvent used to dissolve
the sample by the weight of the sample. The actual solubilities may be greater than the
numbers calculated because of the use of solvent aliquots that were too large or because of
slow dissolution rates. The solubility number is expressed as "less than" if dissolution did not
occur during the experiment. The solubility number is expressed as "greater than" if
dissolution occurred on addition of the -firstsolvent aliquot.
10260]    Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC). DSC analyses were carried out using a
TA Instruments Q2000 instrument. The instrument temperature calibration was performed
                                                81

   WO 2016/044182                                                         PCT/US2015/050037
 using indium. The DSC cell was kept under a. nitrogen purge of -50 mL per minute during
 each analysis. The sample was placed in a standard, crimped, aluminum pan and was heated
 from 20 'C to 350 'C at a rate of 10 C per minute.
 [0261]    Thermogravinetric (TGA) Analysis. The TGA analysis was carried out using a TA
Instruments Q50 instrument. The instrument balance was calibrated using class I weights
and the temperature calibration was performed using alumel. The nitrogen purge was -40 ml
per minute at the balance and -60 ml per minute at the ftrnace, Each sample was placed into
a pretared platinum pan and heated from 20 0C to 350 'C at a rate of 10 'C per minute.
 [02621    Karl Fischer (KF) Analyses. Karl Fischer analyses were carried out using a Mettler
Toledo C20 Coulomnetric KF titrator. The instrument was calibrated with a standard of
known water concentration.
10263]     Dynamic Vapor Sorption (DVS). DVS analyses were carried out in a TA
Instruments 05000 Dynamic Vapor Sorption analyzer. The instrument was calibrated with
standard weights and a sodium bromide standard for humidity. Samples were analyzed at 25
'C with a maximum equilibration time of 60 minutes in 10% relative humidity (RH) steps
from 5 to 95% RH (adsorption cycle) and from 95 to 5% RH (desorption cycle).
[0264]     Method . 50 mg of Compound .1was dissolved in I mL of
methanol/dichlorometharie, agitated, and then evaporated.
[0265]     Method II A solution of Compound 1, methanol and dichloromethane, was
concentrated under vacuum at 4 0 'C to about 10 volumes. Methanol was charged and the
reaction mixture was concentrated under vacuum at 40 'C to about 10 volumes (and repeated
once). The slurry was agitated at 20 'C for at least 2 hours. The slurry was filtered and the
filter cake was rinsed with methanol and ethyl acetate. The wet product was dried under
vacuum at NMT 40 'C.
[0266]    Form I is characterized by the X-ray powder diffraction pattern in Figure 1, and the
differential scanning calorimetry plot in Figure 3 showing endotherms at about 133
(conversion to Form 1II), 170 and 273 'C (decomposition).,

  [02671    Form II is characterized by the X-ray powder diffraction pattern in Figure 5, and the
 differential scanning calorimetry plot in Figure 7 showing endothenns at about 98 'C
 (conversion to Form IV), 253 'C and 274 *C (decomposition).
 102681     Form III was generated at 138 'C from Form I in a variable temperature XRD (VT
 XRD) experiment. Form III is stable when cooled to 25 'C and does not convert back to
 Form I. Form III was converted back to Form I in a competition sirry experiment with Fonn
 I in methanol within about 2 weeks (10 mg of each of Forn I and Fonn 1I.1 in methanol).
 Forn III is characterized by the X-ray powder diffraction pattern in Figure 9, and the
 differential scanning calorimetry plot in Figure I I showing endotherms at about 181 and 271
 *C (decomposition).
 [0269]    Fonn IV was generated between 95 and 110 'C from Form I in a variable
temperature XRD experiment. Form IV converts back to Form II when cooled to 25 'C in
the VT XRD experiment. Form III is characterized by the X-ray powder diffraction pattern
in Figure 13,
