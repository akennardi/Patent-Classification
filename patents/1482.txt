                                       BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
 5              This disclosure accompanies a divisional application of AU2013328916, the contents of
   which are incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
   1.           Field of the Invention
                The present invention relates generally to health equipment and, more specifically, to
 0 oxygen concentrators.
   2.           Description of the Related Art
                There are many patients that require supplemental oxygen as part of Long Term Oxygen
   Therapy (LTOT). Currently, the vast majority of patients that are receiving LTOT are diagnosed
   under the general category of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, COPD.                   This general
 5 diagnosis includes such common diseases as Chronic Asthma, Emphysema, Congestive Heart
   Failure and several other cardio-pulmonary conditions.              Other people (e.g., obese individuals)
   may also require supplemental oxygen, for example, to maintain elevated activity levels.
                Doctors may prescribe oxygen concentrators or portable tanks of medical oxygen for
   these patients. Usually a specific oxygen flow rate is prescribed (e.g., 1 liter per minute (LPM), 2
 O LPM, 3 LPM, etc.). Experts in this field have also recognized that exercise for these patients
   provide long term benefits that slow the progression of the disease, improve quality of life and
   extend patient longevity. Most stationary forms of exercise like tread mills and stationary
   bicycles, however, are too strenuous for these patients. As a result, the need for mobility has
   long been recognized.              Until recently, this mobility has been facilitated by the use of small
25 compressed oxygen tanks. The disadvantage of these tanks is that they have a finite amount of
   oxygen and they are heavy, weighing about 50 pounds, when mounted on a cart with dolly
   wheels.
                Oxygen concentrators have been in use for about 50 years to supply patients suffering
   from respiratory insufficiency with supplemental oxygen. Traditional oxygen concentrators used
30 to provide these flow rates have been bulky and heavy making ordinary ambulatory activities
   with them difficult and impractical. Recently, companies that manufacture large stationary home
   oxygen concentrators began developing portable oxygen concentrators, POCs. The advantage of
   POCs concentrators was that they can produce a theoretically endless supply of oxygen. In order
                                                           Page 1

   to make these devices small for mobility, the various systems necessary for the production of
   oxygen enriched gas are condensed.
                                                 SUMMARY
                 Systems and methods of providing an oxygen enriched gas to a user of an oxygen
 5 concentrator are described herein.
                In some embodiments, a method of providing an oxygen enriched gas to a user of an
   oxygen concentrator includes assessing a preselected prescription for the oxygen concentrator.
   Based on the preselected prescription, the compressor is operated at a percentage of the normal
   maximum compressor speed, wherein the percentage is assessed based on the preselected
 0 prescription. When the prescription is changed, the compressor speed is changed to a different
   percentage of the normal maximum compressor speed based on changes in the prescription.
                The method may also include assessing the breathing rate of the user during use of the
   oxygen concentrator and operating the compressor at a percentage of the normal maximum
   compressor speed, wherein the percentage is assessed based on the preselected prescription and
 5 the assessed breathing rate. If the users breathing rate changes, the controller may adjust the
   compressor speed to a different percentage of the normal maximum compressor speed, based on
   changes in the prescription and the assessed breathing rate.
                The controller may be configured to run the compressor at a speed less than the normal
   maximum compressor speed when the prescription is set at or below a predetermined rate. The
 O controller may also be configured to run the compressor at a speed greater than the normal
   maximum compressor speed when a breathing rate of the user exceeds a predetermined breathing
   rate and when the prescription is set at or above a predetermined rate.
                In an embodiment, the compression system comprises a first compressor and a second
   compressor. While two compressors are described, it should be understood that three of more
25 compressors may be used in a compression system. The controller is configured to automatically
   run one of the first compressor or the second compressor when the prescription is set at or below
   a predetermined rate, wherein the selection of the first compressor or the second compressor is
   arbitrarily made by the controller. The controller is further configured to automatically increase
   the speed of the first compressor or second compressor if the breathing rate of the user increases
30 or the prescription increases.         If the first compressor or second compressor reaches a
   predetermined percentage of the normal maximum compressor speed, the compressor that is not
   in operation may be turned on. When the predetermined percentage of the normal maximum
   compressor speed is less than 100%, and when the compressor that was not in operation is turned
   on, both the first compressor and the second compressor are run at a speed of less than 100% of
                                                     Page 2

   the normal maximum compressor speed. In some embodiments, the first compressor and the
   second compressor are operated at the same percentage of the normal compressor speed.
                In some embodiments, an oxygen concentrator includes at least one canister; gas
   separation adsorbent disposed in at least one canister, at least two electrodes coupled to at least
 5 one canister, and a power supply coupled to at least one of the electrodes. The gas separation
   adsorbent separates at least some nitrogen from air in the canister to produce oxygen enriched
   gas. The power supply is configured to electrically excite at least one of the electrodes such that
   current flows between the electrodes and ionizes air between the two electrodes. The ionized air
   assists in removal of at least one compound from the gas separation adsorbent. At least one
 0 compound is water and/or bacteria.
                In some embodiments, a method of treating gas separation adsorbent of an oxygen
   concentrator includes providing electrical current to a first electrode such that electrical current
   flows from the first electrode to a second electrode; the electrical current flowing through at least
   a portion of the gas adsorbent and ionizing air in the gas separation adsorbent; and removing one
 5 or more compounds from the ionized gas separation adsorbent.
                In some embodiments, a method of treating gas separation adsorbent in an oxygen
   concentrator includes providing air to the gas separation adsorbent, providing electrical current to
   a first electrode such that electrical current flows from the first electrode to a second electrode;
   the electrical current flowing through at least a portion of the gas adsorbent and ionizing at least a
 O portion of the provided air, and removing one or more compounds from the gas separation
   adsorbent.
                A method of operating an oxygen concentrator system includes providing at least two
   electrodes to at least one canister of a first oxygen concentrator of the oxygen concentrator
   system, the gas canister comprising gas separation adsorbent. Electrical current is to a first
25 electrode of the two electrodes such that electrical current flows from the first electrode to a
   second electrode of the two electrodes. The electrical current flows through at least a portion of a
   gas adsorbent for a period of time. The canister after the period of time has elapsed is provided
   to a second oxygen concentrator of the oxygen concentrator system.
                A method of providing oxygen enriched gas to a user of an oxygen concentrator system,
30 includes automatically assessing a state of the gas separation adsorbent and operating the power
   supply at a voltage sufficient to electrically excite at least one of the electrodes such that current
   flows between the electrodes and ionizes the gas separation adsorbent.
                A method of operating an oxygen concentrator system includes turning an oxygen
   concentrator apparatus to an off position, assessing a pressure of one or more canisters of the
                                                    Page 3
   10222766_2 (GHMatters) P99796.AU.1

    turned-off oxygen concentrator, and pressurizing at least one canister when the assessed pressure
    is below a desired pressure.
                 A method of providing oxygen enriched gas to a user of an oxygen concentrator includes
    automatically assessing a state of the oxygen concentrator, automatically assessing a pressure of
 5  at least one of the canisters for the oxygen concentrator, wherein the pressure is assessed during
    an off state, and operating the compressor at a compressor speed sufficient to pressurize at least
    one of the canisters to a desired pressure based on the assessed pressure of the oxygen
    concentrator.
                 In an embodiment, an oxygen concentrator includes: at least two canisters; gas separation
 0  adsorbent disposed in at least two canisters, wherein the gas separation adsorbent separates at
    least some nitrogen from air in the canister to produce oxygen enriched gas; a compression
    system comprising at least one compressor coupled to at least one canister; an accumulator for
    storing oxygen enriched gas produced from the at least two canisters; and one or more oxygen
    sensors coupled to the accumulator. During use the oxygen concentrator may be operated by:
 5  automatically assessing a purity of the oxygen enriched gas stored in the accumulator, based on
    data obtained from the one or more oxygen sensors; operating the compressor at speed that is
    based on the purity of oxygen enriched gas in the accumulator; and adjusting the compressor
    speed based on changes in the purity of oxygen enriched gas in the accumulator.

 5               While the invention is susceptible to various modifications and alternative forms, specific
    embodiments thereof are shown by way of example in the drawings and will herein be described
    in detail. It should be understood, however, that the drawings and detailed description thereto are
    not intended to limit the invention to the particular form disclosed, but on the contrary, the

                                            DETAILED DESCRIPTION
                 It is to be understood the present invention is not limited to particular devices or methods,
    which may, of course, vary. It is also to be understood that the terminology used herein is for the
    purpose of describing particular embodiments only, and is not intended to be limiting. Headings
25  are for organizational purposes only and are not meant to be used to limit or interpret the
    description or claims. As used in this specification and the appended claims, the singular forms
    "a", "an", and "the" include singular and plural referents unless the content clearly dictates
    otherwise. Furthermore, the word "may" is used throughout this application in a permissive
    sense (i.e., having the potential to, being able to), not in a mandatory sense (i.e., must). The term
30  "include," and derivations thereof, mean "including, but not limited to."
                 The term "coupled" as used herein means either a direct connection or an indirect
    connection (e.g., one or more intervening connections) between one or more objects or
    components. The phrase "connected" means a direct connection between objects or components
                                                         Page 5
    10222766_2 (GHMatters) P99796.AU.1

    such that the objects or components are connected directly to each other. As used herein the
    phrase "obtaining" a device means that the device is either purchased or constructed.
                 Oxygen concentrators take advantage of pressure swing adsorption (PSA). Pressure
    swing adsorption involves using a compressor to increase gas pressure inside a canister that
 5  contains particles of a gas separation adsorbent. As the pressure increases, certain molecules in
    the gas may become adsorbed onto the gas separation adsorbent. Removal of a portion of the gas
    in the canister under the pressurized conditions allows separation of the non-adsorbed molecules
    from the adsorbed molecules. The gas separation adsorbent may be regenerated by reducing the
    pressure, which reverses the adsorption of molecules from the adsorbent. Further details
 0  regarding oxygen concentrators may be found, for example, in U.S. Published Patent Application
    No. 2009-0065007, published March 12, 2009, and entitled "Oxygen Concentrator Apparatus
    and Method", which is incorporated herein by reference.
                 Ambient air usually includes approximately 78% nitrogen and 21% oxygen with the
    balance comprised of argon, carbon dioxide, water vapor and other trace elements.            If a gas
 5  mixture such as air, for example, is passed under pressure through a vessel containing a gas
    separation adsorbent bed that attracts nitrogen more strongly than it does oxygen, part or all of
    the nitrogen will stay in the bed, and the gas coming out of the vessel will be enriched in oxygen.
    When the bed reaches the end of its capacity to adsorb nitrogen, it can be regenerated by
    reducing the pressure, thereby releasing the adsorbed nitrogen. It is then ready for another cycle
 '0 of producing oxygen enriched air. By alternating canisters in a two-canister system, one canister
    can be collecting oxygen while the other canister is being purged (resulting in a continuous
    separation of the oxygen from the nitrogen). In this manner, oxygen can be accumulated out of
    the air for a variety of uses include providing supplemental oxygen to patients.
                 FIG. 1 illustrates a schematic diagram of an oxygen concentrator 100, according to an
25  embodiment. Oxygen concentrator 100 may concentrate oxygen out of an air stream to provide
    oxygen enriched gas to a user. As used herein, "oxygen enriched gas" is composed of at least
    about 50% oxygen, at least about 60% oxygen, at least about 70% oxygen, at least about 80%
    oxygen, at least about 90% oxygen, at least about 95% oxygen, at least about 98% oxygen, or at
    least about 99% oxygen.
30               Oxygen concentrator 100 may be a portable oxygen concentrator.     For example, oxygen
    concentrator 100 may have a weight and size that allows the oxygen concentrator to be carried by
    hand and/or in a carrying case. In one embodiment, oxygen concentrator 100 has a weight of less
    than about 20 lbs., less than about 15 lbs., less than about 10 lbs., or less than about 5 lbs. In an
    embodiment, oxygen concentrator 100 has a volume of less than about 1000 cubic inches, less
                                                       Page 6
    10222766_2 (GHMatters) P99796.AU.1

    than about 750 cubic inches; less than about 500 cubic inches, less than about 250 cubic inches,
    or less than about 200 cubic inches.
                 Oxygen may be collected from ambient air by pressurizing ambient air in canisters 302
    and 304, which include a gas separation adsorbent. Gas separation adsorbents useful in an
 5  oxygen concentrator are capable of separating at least nitrogen from an air stream to produce
    oxygen enriched gas. Examples of gas separation adsorbents include molecular sieves that are
    capable of separation of nitrogen from an air stream. Examples of adsorbents that may be used in
    an oxygen concentrator include, but are not limited to, zeolites (natural) or synthetic crystalline
    aluminosilicates that separate nitrogen from oxygen in an air stream under elevated pressure.
 0  Examples of synthetic crystalline aluminosilicates that may be used include, but are not limited
    to: OXYSIV adsorbents available from UOP LLC, Des Plaines, IW; SYLOBEAD adsorbents
    available from W. R. Grace & Co, Columbia, MD; SILIPORITE adsorbents available from
    CECA S.A. of Paris, France; ZEOCHEM adsorbents available from Zeochem AG, Uetikon,
    Switzerland; and AgLiLSX adsorbent available from Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.,
 5  Allentown, PA.
                 As shown in FIG. 1, air may enter the oxygen concentrator through air inlet 106. Air may
    be drawn into air inlet 106 by compression system 200. Compression system 200 may draw in
    air from the surroundings of the oxygen concentrator and compress the air, forcing the
    compressed air into one or both canisters 302 and 304. In an embodiment, an inlet muffler 108
 '0 may be coupled to air inlet 106 to reduce sound produced by air being pulled into the oxygen
    generator by compression system 200. In an embodiment, inlet muffler 108 may be a moisture
    and sound absorbing muffler. For example, a water absorbent material (such as a polymer water
    absorbent material or a zeolite material) may be used to both absorb water from the incoming air
    and to reduce the sound of the air passing into the air inlet 106.
25               Compression system 200 may include one or more compressors capable of compressing
    air.      In some embodiments, compression system may include one, two, three, four, or more
    compressors. Compression system 200 as depicted that includes compressor 210 and motor 220.
    Motor 220 is coupled to compressor 210 and provides an operating force to the compressor to
    operate the compression mechanism. Pressurized air, produced by compression system 200, may
30  be forced into one or both of the canisters 302 and 304. In some embodiments, the ambient air
    may be pressurized in the canisters to a pressure approximately in a range of 13-20 pounds per
    square inch (psi). Other pressures may also be used, depending on the type of gas separation
    adsorbent disposed in the canisters.

    10222766_2 (GHMatters) P99796.AU.1

                In some embodiments, motor 220 is coupled to a pressurizing device (e.g. piston pump or
   a diaphragm pump).                   The pressuring device may be a piston pump that has multiple pistons.
   During operation, the pistons may be selectively turned on or off. In some embodiments, motor
   220 may be coupled to multiple pumps. Each pump may be selectively turned on or off. For
 5 example, controller 400 may determine which pumps or pistons should be operated based on
   predetermined operating conditions.
                Coupled to each canister 302/304 are inlet valves 122/124 and outlet valves 132/134. As
   shown in FIG. 1, inlet valve 122 is coupled to canister 302 and inlet valve 124 is coupled to
   canister 304.               Outlet valve 132 is coupled to canister 302 and outlet valve 134 is coupled to
 0 canister 304.                Inlet valves 122/124 are used to control the passage of air from compression
   system 200 to the respective canisters. Outlet valves 132/134 are used to release gas from the
   respective canisters during a venting process. In some embodiments, inlet valves 122/124 and
   outlet valves 132/134 may be silicon plunger solenoid valves. Other types of valves, however,
   may be used. Plunger valves offer advantages over other kinds of valves by being quiet and
 5 having low slippage.
                In some embodiments, a two-step valve actuation voltage may be used to control inlet
   valves 122/124 and outlet valves 132/134. For example, a high voltage (e.g., 24 V) may be
   applied to an inlet valve to open the inlet valve. The voltage may then be reduced (e.g., to 7 V)
   to keep the inlet valve open. Using less voltage to keep a valve open may use less power (Power
 0 =   Voltage * Current). This reduction in voltage minimizes heat buildup and power consumption
   to extend run time from the battery. When the power is cut off to the valve, it closes by spring
   action.        In some embodiments, the voltage may be applied as a function of time that is not
   necessarily a stepped response (e.g., a curved downward voltage between an initial 24 V and a
   final 7 V).
25              In some embodiments, air may be pulled into the oxygen concentrator through
   compressors 305, 310.                  In some embodiments, air may flow from compressors 305, 310 to
   canisters 302, 304.                In some embodiments, one of valves 122 or 124 may be closed (e.g., as
   signaled by controller 400) resulting in the combined output of both compressors 305, 310
   lowing through the other respective valve 122 or 124 into a respective canister 302, 304. For
30 example, if valve 124 is closed, the air from both compressors 305, 310 may flow through valve
   122. If valve 122 is closed, the air from both compressors 305, 310 may flow through valve 124.
   In some embodiments, valve 122 and valve 124 may alternate to alternately direct the air from
   the compressors 305, 310 into respective canisters 302 or 304.

                 In an embodiment, pressurized air is sent into one of canisters 302 or 304 while the other
    canister is being vented. For example, during use, inlet valve 122 is opened while inlet valve 124
    is closed. Pressurized air from compression system 200 is forced into canister 302, while being
    inhibited from entering canister 304 by inlet valve 124. In an embodiment, a controller 400 is
 5  electrically coupled to valves 122, 124, 132, and 134.          Controller 400 includes one or more
    processors 410 operable to execute program instructions stored in memory 420. The program
    instructions are operable to perform various predefined methods that are used to operate the
    oxygen concentrator. Controller 400 may include program instructions for operating inlet valves
    122 and 124 out of phase with each other, i.e., when one of inlet valves 122 or 124 is opened, the
 0  other valve is closed. During pressurization of canister 302, outlet valve 132 is closed and outlet
    valve 134 is opened. Similar to the inlet valves, outlet valves 132 and 134 are operated out of
    phase with each other. In some embodiments, the voltages and the duration of the voltages used
    to open the input and output valves may be controlled by controller 400.
                 Check valves 142 and 144 are coupled to canisters 302 and 304, respectively. Check
 5  valves 142 and 144 are one way valves that are passively operated by the pressure differentials
    that occur as the canisters are pressurized and vented. Check valves 142 and 144 are coupled to
    canisters to allow oxygen produced during pressurization of the canister to flow out of the
    canister, and to inhibit back flow of oxygen or any other gases into the canister. In this manner,
    check valves 142 and 144 act as one way valves allowing oxygen enriched gas to exit the
 '0 respective canister during pressurization.
                 The term "check valve", as used herein, refers to a valve that allows flow of a fluid (gas
    or liquid) in one direction and inhibits back flow of the fluid. Examples of check valves that are
    suitable for use include, but are not limited to: a ball check valve; a diaphragm check valve; a
    butterfly check valve; a swing check valve; a duckbill valve; and a lift check valve. Under
25  pressure, nitrogen molecules in the pressurized ambient air are adsorbed by the gas separation
    adsorbent in the pressurized canister. As the pressure increases, more nitrogen is adsorbed until
    the gas in the canister is enriched in oxygen. The nonadsorbed gas molecules (mainly oxygen)
    flow out of the pressurized canister when the pressure reaches a point sufficient to overcome the
    resistance of the check valve coupled to the canister. In one embodiment, the pressure drop of
30  the check valve in the forward direction is less than 1 psi. The break pressure in the reverse
    direction is greater than 100 psi. It should be understood, however, that modification of one or
    more components would alter the operating parameters of these valves. If the forward flow
    pressure is increased, there is, generally, a reduction in oxygen enriched gas production. If the
                                                       Page 9
    10222766_2 (GHMatters) P99796.AU.1

   break pressure for reverse flow is reduced or set too low, there is, generally, a reduction in
   oxygen enriched gas pressure.
                In an exemplary embodiment, canister 302 is pressurized by compressed air produced in
   compression system 200 and passed into canister 302. During pressurization of canister 302 inlet
 5 valve 122 is open, outlet valve 132 is closed, inlet valve 124 is closed and outlet valve 134 is
   open.         Outlet valve 134 is opened when outlet valve 132 is closed to allow substantially
   simultaneous venting of canister 304 while canister 302 is pressurized.                  Canister 302 is
   pressurized until the pressure in canister is sufficient to open check valve 142. Oxygen enriched
   gas produced in canister 302 exits through check valve and, in one embodiment, is collected in
 0 accumulator 106.
                After some time the gas separation adsorbent will become saturated with nitrogen and
   will be unable to separate significant amounts of nitrogen from incoming air. This point is
   usually reached after a predetermined time of oxygen enriched gas production.                      In the
   embodiment described above, when the gas separation adsorbent in canister 302 reaches this
 5 saturation point, the inflow of compressed air is stopped and canister 302 is vented to remove
   nitrogen. During venting, inlet valve 122 is closed, and outlet valve 132 is opened. While
   canister 302 is being vented, canister 304 is pressurized to produce oxygen enriched gas in the
   same manner described above. Pressurization of canister 304 is achieved by closing outlet valve
   134 and opening inlet valve 124.          The oxygen enriched gas exits canister 304 through check
 O valve 144.
                During venting of canister 302, outlet valve 132 is opened allowing pressurized gas
   (mainly nitrogen) to exit the canister through concentrator outlet 130. In an embodiment, the
   vented gases may be directed through muffler 133 to reduce the noise produced by releasing the
   pressurized gas from the canister. As gas is released from canister 302, pressure in the canister
25 drops. The drop in pressure may allow the nitrogen to become desorbed from the gas separation
   adsorbent. The released nitrogen exits the canister through outlet 130, resetting the canister to a
   state that allows renewed separation of oxygen from an air stream. Muffler 133 may include
   open cell foam (or another material) to muffle the sound of the gas leaving the oxygen
   concentrator. In some embodiments, the combined muffling components/techniques for the input
30 of air and the output of gas may provide for oxygen concentrator operation at a sound level
   below 50 decibels.
                During venting of the canisters, it is advantageous that at least a majority of the nitrogen
   is removed. In an embodiment, at least about 50%, at least about 60%, at least about 70%, at
   least about 80%, at least about 90%, at least about 95%, at least about 98%, or substantially all of
                                                        Page 10

    the nitrogen in a canister is removed before the canister is re-used to separate oxygen from air.
    In some embodiments, a canister may be further purged of nitrogen using an oxygen enriched
    stream that is introduced into the canister from the other canister.
                 In an exemplary embodiment, a portion of the oxygen enriched gas may be transferred
 5  from canister 302 to canister 304 when canister 304 is being vented of nitrogen. Transfer of
    oxygen enriched gas from canister 302 to 304, during venting of canister 304, helps to further
    purge nitrogen (and other gases) from the canister. In an embodiment, oxygen enriched gas may
    travel through flow restrictors 151, 153, and 155 between the two canisters. Flow restrictor 151
    may be a trickle flow restrictor.            Flow restrictor 151, for example, may be a 0.009D flow
 0  restrictor (e.g., the flow restrictor has a radius of 0.009 inches which is less than the diameter of
    the tube it is inside). Flow restrictors 153 and 155 may be 0.013D flow restrictors. Other flow
    restrictor types and sizes are also contemplated and may be used depending on the specific
    configuration and tubing used to couple the canisters. In some embodiments, the flow restrictors
    may be press fit flow restrictors that restrict air flow by introducing a narrower diameter in their
 5  respective tube. In some embodiments, the press fit flow restrictors may be made of sapphire,
    metal or plastic (other materials are also contemplated).
                 Flow of oxygen enriched gas is also controlled by use of valve 152 and valve 154.
    Valves 152 and 154 may be opened for a short duration during the venting process (and may be
    closed otherwise) to prevent excessive oxygen loss out of the purging canister. Other durations
 '0 are also contemplated.             In an exemplary embodiment, canister 302 is being vented and it is
    desirable to purge canister 302 by passing a portion of the oxygen enriched gas being produced in
    canister 304 into canister 302. A portion of oxygen enriched gas, upon pressurization of canister
    304, will pass through flow restrictor 151 into canister 302 during venting of canister 302.
    Additional oxygen enriched air is passed into canister 302, from canister 304, through valve 154
25  and flow restrictor 155. Valve 152 may remain closed during the transfer process, or may be
    opened if additional oxygen enriched gas is needed. The selection of appropriate flow restrictors
    151 and 155, coupled with controlled opening of valve 154 allows a controlled amount of oxygen
    enriched gas to be sent from canister 304 to 302. In an embodiment, the controlled amount of
    oxygen enriched gas is an amount sufficient to purge canister 302 and minimize the loss of
30  oxygen enriched gas through venting valve 132 of canister 302.                 While this embodiment
    describes venting of canister 302, it should be understood that the same process can be used to
    vent canister 304 using flow restrictor 151, valve 152 and flow restrictor 153.
                 The pair of equalization/vent valves 152/154 work with flow restrictors 153 and 155 to
    optimize the air flow balance between the two canisters. This may allow for better flow control
                                                         Page 11

   for venting the canisters with oxygen enriched gas from the other of the canisters. It may also
   provide better flow direction between the two canisters. It has been found that, while flow valves
   152/154 may be operated as bi-directional valves, the flow rate through such valves varies
   depending on the direction of fluid flowing through the valve. For example, oxygen enriched gas
 5 flowing from canister 304 toward canister 302 has a flow rate faster through valve 152 than the
   flow rate of oxygen enriched gas flowing from canister 302 toward canister 304 through valve
   152. If a single valve was to be used, eventually either too much or too little oxygen enriched
   gas would be sent between the canisters and the canisters would, over time, begin to produce
   different amounts of oxygen enriched gas.         Use of opposing valves and flow restrictors on
 0 parallel air pathways may equalize the flow pattern of the oxygen between the two canisters.
   Equalizing the flow may allow for a steady amount of oxygen available to the user over multiple
   cycles and also may allow a predictable volume of oxygen to purge the other of the canisters. In
   some embodiments, the air pathway may not have restrictors but may instead have a valve with a
   built in resistance or the air pathway itself may have a narrow radius to provide resistance.
 5              At times, oxygen concentrator may be shut down for a period of time. When an oxygen
   concentrator is shut down, the temperature inside the canisters may drop as a result of the loss of
   adiabatic heat from the compression system. As the temperature drops, the volume occupied by
   the gases inside the canisters will drop. Cooling of the canisters may lead to a negative pressure
   in the canisters. Valves (e.g., valves 122, 124, 132, and 134) leading to and from the canisters
 0 are dynamically sealed rather than hermetically sealed. Thus, outside air may enter the canisters
   after shutdown to accommodate the pressure differential. When outside air enters the canisters,
   moisture from the outside air may condense inside the canister as the air cools. Condensation of
   water inside the canisters may lead to gradual degradation of the gas separation adsorbents,
   steadily reducing ability of the gas separation adsorbents to produce oxygen enriched gas.
25              In an embodiment, outside air may be inhibited from entering canisters after the oxygen
   concentrator is shut down by pressurizing both canisters prior to shut down. By storing the
   canisters under a positive pressure, the valves may be forced into a hermetically closed position
   by the internal pressure of the air in the canisters.       In an embodiment, the pressure in the
   canisters, at shutdown, should be at least greater than ambient pressure. As used herein the term
30 "ambient pressure" refers to the pressure of the surroundings that the oxygen generator is located
   (e.g. the pressure inside a room, outside, in a plane, etc.). In an embodiment, the pressure in the
   canisters, at shutdown, is at least greater than standard atmospheric pressure (i.e., greater than
   760 mmHg (Torr), 1 atm, 101,325 Pa).           In an embodiment, the pressure in the canisters, at
                                                    Page 12
   10222766_2 (GHMatters) P99796.AU.1

   shutdown, is at least about 1.1 times greater than ambient pressure; is at least about 1.5 times
   greater than ambient pressure; or is at least about 2 times greater than ambient pressure.
                In an embodiment, pressurization of the canisters may be achieved by directing
   pressurized air into each canister from the compression system and closing all valves to trap the
 5 pressurized air in the canisters. In an exemplary embodiment, when a shutdown sequence is
   initiated, inlet valves 122 and 124 are opened and outlet valves 132 and 134 are closed. Because
   inlet valves 122 and 124 are joined together by a common conduit, both canisters 302 and 304
   may become pressurized as air and or oxygen enriched gas from one canister may be transferred
   to the other canister.             This situation may occur when the pathway between the compression
 0 system and the two inlet valves allows such transfer. Because the oxygen generator operates in
   an alternating pressurize/venting mode, at least one of the canisters should be in a pressurized
   state at any given time. In an alternate embodiment, the pressure may be increased in each
   canister by operation of compression system 200. When inlet valves 122 and 124 are opened,
   pressure between canisters 302 and 304 will equalize, however, the equalized pressure in either
 5 canister may not be sufficient to inhibit air from entering the canisters during shutdown. In order
   to ensure that air is inhibited from entering the canisters, compression system 200 may be
   operated for a time sufficient to increase the pressure inside both canisters to a level at least
   greater than ambient pressure. Regardless of the method of pressurization of the canisters, once
   the canisters are pressurized, inlet valves 122 and 124 are closed, trapping the pressurized air
 O inside the canisters, which inhibits air from entering the canisters during the shutdown period.
                An outlet system, coupled to one or more of the canisters, includes one or more conduits
   for providing oxygen enriched gas to a user. In an embodiment, oxygen enriched gas produced
   in either of canisters 302 and 304 is collected in accumulator 106 through check valves 142 and
   144, respectively, as depicted schematically in FIG. 1. The oxygen enriched gas leaving the
25 canisters may be collected in oxygen accumulator 106 prior to being provided to a user. In some
   embodiments, a tube may be coupled to accumulator 106 to provide the oxygen enriched gas to
   the user. Oxygen enriched gas may be provided to the user through an airway delivery device
   that transfer the oxygen enriched gas to the user's mouth and/or nose. In an embodiment, an
   outlet may include a tube that directs the oxygen toward a user's nose and/or mouth that may not
30 be directly coupled to the user's nose.
                Turning to FIG. 2, a schematic diagram of an embodiment of an outlet system for an
   oxygen concentrator is shown. Supply valve 160 may be coupled to outlet tube to control the
   release of the oxygen enriched gas from accumulator 106 to the user. In an embodiment, supply
   valve 160 is an electromagnetically actuated plunger valve. Supply valve 160 is actuated by
                                                          Page 13
   10222766_2 (GHMatters) P99796.AU.1

   controller 400 to control the delivery of oxygen enriched gas to a user. Actuation of supply valve
   160 is not timed or synchronized to the pressure swing adsorption process. Instead, actuation is,
   in some embodiments, synchronized to the patient's breathing. Additionally, supply valve 160
   may have multiple actuations to help establish a clinically effective flow profile for providing
 5 oxygen enriched gas.
                Oxygen enriched gas in accumulator 106 passes through supply valve 160 into expansion
   chamber 170 as depicted in FIG. 2. In an embodiment, expansion chamber may include one or
   more devices capable of being used to determine an oxygen concentration of gas passing through
   the chamber. Oxygen enriched gas in expansion chamber 170 builds briefly, through release of
 0 gas from accumulator by supply valve 160, and then is bled through small orifice flow restrictor
   175 to flow rate sensor 185 and then to particulate filter 187. Flow restrictor 175 may be a 0.025
   D flow restrictor. Other flow restrictor types and sizes may be used. In some embodiments, the
   diameter of the air pathway in the housing may be restricted to create restricted air flow. Flow
   rate sensor 185 may be any sensor capable of assessing the rate of gas flowing through the
 5 conduit. Particulate filter 187 may be used to filter bacteria, dust, granule particles, etc. prior to
   delivery of the oxygen enriched gas to the user. The oxygen enriched gas passes through filter
   187 to connector 190 which sends the oxygen enriched gas to the user via conduit 192 and to
   pressure sensor 194.
                The fluid dynamics of the outlet pathway, coupled with the programmed actuations of
 0 supply valve 160, results in a bolus of oxygen being provided at the correct time and with a flow
   profile that assures rapid delivery into the patient's lungs without any excessive flow rates that
   would result in wasted retrograde flow out the nostrils and into the atmosphere.          It has been
   found, in our specific system, that the total volume of the bolus required for prescriptions is equal
   to 11 mL for each LPM, i.e., 11 mL for a prescription of 1 LPM; 22 mL for a prescription of 2
25 LPM; 33 mL for a prescription of 3 LPM; 44 mL for a prescription of 4 LPM; 55 mL for a
   prescription of 5 LPM; etc. This is generally referred to as the LPM equivalent. It should be
   understood that the LPM equivalent may vary between apparatus due to differences in
   construction design, tubing size, chamber size, etc.
                Expansion chamber 170 may include one or more oxygen sensors capable of being used
30 to determine an oxygen concentration of gas passing through the chamber. In an embodiment,
   the oxygen concentration of gas passing through expansion chamber 170 is assessed using
   oxygen sensor 165.                 An oxygen sensor is a device capable of detecting oxygen in a gas.
   Examples of oxygen sensors include, but are not limited to, ultrasonic oxygen sensors, electrical
   oxygen sensors, and optical oxygen sensors.               In one embodiment, oxygen sensor 165 is an
                                                         Page 14

   ultrasonic oxygen sensor that includes ultrasonic emitter 166 and ultrasonic receiver 168.       In
   some embodiments, ultrasonic emitter 166 may include multiple ultrasonic emitters and
   ultrasonic receiver 168 may include multiple ultrasonic receivers.         In embodiments having
   multiple emitters/receivers, the multiple ultrasonic emitters and multiple ultrasonic receivers may
 5 be axially aligned (e.g., across the gas mixture flow path which may be perpendicular to the axial
   alignment).
                In use, an ultrasonic sound wave (from emitter 166) may be directed through oxygen
   enriched gas disposed in chamber 170 to receiver 168. Ultrasonic sensor assembly may be based
   on detecting the speed of sound through the gas mixture to determine the composition of the gas
 0 mixture (e.g., the speed of sound is different in nitrogen and oxygen). In a mixture of the two
   gases, the speed of sound through the mixture may be an intermediate value proportional to the
   relative amounts of each gas in the mixture. In use, the sound at the receiver 168 is slightly out
   of phase with the sound sent from emitter 166. This phase shift is due to the relatively slow
   velocity of sound through a gas medium as compared with the relatively fast speed of the
 5 electronic pulse through wire. The phase shift, then, is proportional to the distance between the
   emitter and the receiver and the speed of sound through the expansion chamber. The density of
   the gas in the chamber affects the speed of sound through the chamber and the density is
   proportional to the ratio of oxygen to nitrogen in the chamber. Therefore, the phase shift can be
   used to measure the concentration of oxygen in the expansion chamber.            In this manner the
 O relative concentration of oxygen in the accumulation chamber may be assessed as a function of
   one or more properties of a detected sound wave traveling through the accumulation chamber.
                In some embodiments, multiple emitters 166 and receivers 168 may be used.          The
   readings from the emitters 166 and receivers 168 may be averaged to cancel errors that may be
   inherent in turbulent flow systems. In some embodiments, the presence of other gases may also
25 be detected by measuring the transit time and comparing the measured transit time to
   predetermined transit times for other gases and/or mixtures of gases.
                The sensitivity of the ultrasonic sensor system may be increased by increasing the
   distance between emitter 166 and receiver 168, for example to allow several sound wave cycles
   to occur between emitter 166 and the receiver 168. In some embodiments, if at least two sound
30 cycles are present, the influence of structural changes of the transducer may be reduced by
   measuring the phase shift relative to a fixed reference at two points in time. If the earlier phase
   shift is subtracted from the later phase shift, the shift caused by thermal expansion of expansion
   chamber 170 may be reduced or cancelled. The shift caused by a change of the distance between
   emitter 166 and receiver 168 may be the approximately the same at the measuring intervals,

   whereas a change owing to a change in oxygen concentration may be cumulative.                    In some
   embodiments, the shift measured at a later time may be multiplied by the number of intervening
   cycles and compared to the shift between two adjacent cycles. Further details regarding sensing
   of oxygen in the expansion chamber may be found, for example, in U.S. Published Patent
 5 Application No. 2009-0065007, published March 12, 2009, and entitled "Oxygen Concentrator
   Apparatus and Method, which is incorporated herein by reference.
                Flow rate sensor 185 may be used to determine the flow rate of gas flowing through the
   outlet system.                    Flow rate sensors that may be used include, but are not limited to:
   diaphragm/bellows flow meters; rotary flow meters (e.g. Hall Effect flow meters); turbine flow
 0 meters; orifice flow meters; and ultrasonic flow meters. Flow rate sensor 185 may be coupled to
   controller 400. The rate of gas flowing through the outlet system may be an indication of the
   breathing volume of the user. Changes in the flow rate of gas flowing through the outlet system
   may also be used to determine a breathing rate of the user. Controller 400 may control actuation
   of supply valve 160 based on the breathing rate and/or breathing volume of the user, as assessed
 5 by flow rate sensor 185
                In some embodiments, ultrasonic sensor system 165 and, for example, flow rate sensor
   185 may provide a measurement of an actual amount of oxygen being provided. For example,
   follow rate sensor 185 may measure a volume of gas (based on flow rate) provided and ultrasonic
   sensor system 165 may provide the concentration of oxygen of the gas provided. These two
 0 measurements together may be used by controller 400 to determine an approximation of the
   actual amount of oxygen provided to the user.
                Oxygen enriched gas passes through flow meter 185 to filter 187. Filter 187 removes
   bacteria, dust, granule particles, etc. prior to providing the oxygen enriched gas to the user. The
   filtered oxygen enriched gas passes through filter 187 to connector 190. Connector 190 may be a
25 "Y" connector coupling the outlet of filter 187 to pressure sensor 194 and outlet conduit 192.
   Pressure sensor 194 may be used to monitor the pressure of the gas passing through conduit 192
   to the user. Changes in pressure, sensed by pressure sensor 194, may be used to determine a
   breathing rate of a user, as well as the onset of inhalation. Controller 400 may control actuation
   of supply valve 160 based on the breathing rate and/or onset of inhalation of the user, as assessed
30 by pressure sensor 194. In an embodiment, controller 400 may control actuation of supply valve
   160 based on information provided by flow rate sensor 185 and pressure sensor 194.
                Oxygen enriched gas may be provided to a user through conduit 192. In an embodiment,
   conduit 192 may be a silicone tube.                 Conduit 192 may be coupled to a user using an airway
   coupling member 196, as depicted in FIG. 3.                Airway coupling member 196 may be any device
                                                            Page 16

   capable of providing the oxygen enriched gas to nasal cavities or oral cavities.       Examples of
   airway coupling members include, but are not limited to: nasal masks, nasal pillows, nasal
   prongs, nasal cannulas, and mouthpieces. A nasal cannula airway delivery device is depicted in
   FIG. 3. During use, oxygen enriched gas from oxygen concentrator system 100 is provided to
 5 the user through conduit 192 and airway coupling member 196. Airway coupling member 196 is
   positioned proximate to a user's airway (e.g., proximate to the user's mouth and or nose) to allow
   delivery of the oxygen enriched gas to the user while allowing the user to breath air from the
   surroundings.
 0 Canister System
                Oxygen concentrator system 100 may include at least two canisters, each canister
   including a gas separation adsorbent. The canisters of oxygen concentrator system 100 may be
   disposed formed from a molded housing. In an embodiment, canister system 300 includes two
   housing components 310 and 510, as depicted in FIG. 4. The housing components 310 and 510
 5 may be formed separately and then coupled together.                In some embodiments, housing
   components 310 and 510 may be injection molded or compression molded. Housing components
   310 and 510 may be made from a thermoplastic polymer such as polycarbonate, methylene
   carbide, polystyrene, acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), polypropylene, polyethylene, or
   polyvinyl chloride. In another embodiment, housing components 310 and 510 may be made of a
 O thermoset plastic or metal (such as stainless steel or a light-weight aluminum alloy). Lightweight
   materials may be used to reduce the weight of the oxygen concentrator 100.                In some
   embodiments, the two housings 310 and 510 may be fastened together using screws or bolts.
   Alternatively, housing components 310 and 510 may be solvent welded together.
                As shown, valve seats 320, 322, 324, and 326 and air pathways 330 and 332 may be
25 integrated into the housing component 310 to reduce the number of sealed connections needed
   throughout the air flow of the oxygen concentrator 100. In various embodiments, the housing
   components 310 and 410 of the oxygen concentrator 100 may form a two-part molded plastic
   frame that defines two canisters 302 and 304 and accumulation chamber 106.
                Air pathways/tubing between different sections in housing components 310 and 510 may
30 take the form of molded conduits. Conduits in the form of molded channels for air pathways
   may occupy multiple planes in housing components 310 and 510. For example, the molded air
   conduits may be formed at different depths and at different x,y,z positions in housing
   components 310 and 510. In some embodiments, a majority or substantially all of the conduits
   may be integrated into the housing components 310 and 510 to reduce potential leak points.

   10222766_2 (GHMatters) P99796.AU.1

                In some embodiments, prior to coupling housing components 310 and 510 together, 0
   rings may be placed between various points of housing components 310 and 510 to ensure that
   the housing components are properly sealed.                   In some embodiments, components may be
   integrated and/or coupled separately to housing components 310 and 510. For example, tubing,
 5 flow restrictors (e.g., press fit flow restrictors), oxygen sensors, gas separation adsorbents 139,
   check valves, plugs, processors, power supplies, etc. may be coupled to housing components 510
   and 410 before and/or after the housing components are coupled together.
                In some embodiments, apertures 337 leading to the exterior of housing components 310
   and 410 may be used to insert devices such as flow restrictors. Apertures may also be used for
 0 increased moldability. One or more of the apertures may be plugged after molding (e.g., with a
   plastic plug).               In some embodiments, flow restrictors may be inserted into passages prior to
   inserting plug to seal the passage. Press fit flow restrictors may have diameters that may allow a
   friction fit between the press fit flow restrictors and their respective apertures.              In some
   embodiments, an adhesive may be added to the exterior of the press fit flow restrictors to hold the
 5 press fit flow restrictors in place once inserted. In some embodiments, the plugs may have a
   friction fit with their respective tubes (or may have an adhesive applied to their outer surface).
   The press fit flow restrictors and/or other components may be inserted and pressed into their
   respective apertures using a narrow tip tool or rod (e.g., with a diameter less than the diameter of
   the respective aperture). In some embodiments, the press fit flow restrictors may be inserted into
 O their respective tubes until they abut a feature in the tube to halt their insertion. For example, the
   feature may include a reduction in radius. Other features are also contemplated (e.g., a bump in
   the side of the tubing, threads, etc.).           In some embodiments, press fit flow restrictors may be
   molded into the housing components (e.g., as narrow tube segments).
                In some embodiments, spring baffle 129 may be placed into respective canister receiving
25 portions of housing component 310 and 510 with the spring side of the baffle 129 facing the exit
   of the canister. Spring baffle 129 may apply force to gas separation adsorbent 139 in the canister
   while also assisting in preventing gas separation adsorbent 139 from entering the exit apertures.
   Use of a spring baffle 129 may keep the gas separation adsorbent compact while also allowing
   for expansion (e.g., thermal expansion). Keeping the gas separation adsorbent 139 compact may
30 prevent the gas separation adsorbent from breaking during movement of the oxygen concentrator
   system 100).
                In some embodiments, pressurized air from the compression system 200 may enter air
   inlet 306.            Air inlet 306 is coupled to inlet conduit 330. Air enters housing component 310
   through inlet 306 travels through conduit 330, and then to valve seats 322 and 324. FIG. 5 and

    FIG. 6 depict an end view of housing 310. FIG. 5 depicts an end view of housing 310 prior to
    fitting valves to housing 310. FIG. 6 depicts an end view of housing 310 with the valves fitted to
    the housing 310. Valve seats 322 and 324 are configured to receive inlet valves 122 and 124
    respectively. Inlet valve 122 is coupled to canister 302 and inlet valve 124 is coupled to canister
 5  304. Housing 310 also includes valve seats 332 and 334 configured to receive outlet valves 132
    and 134 respectively. Outlet valve 132 is coupled to canister 302 and outlet valve 134 is coupled
    to canister 304. Inlet valves 122/124 are used to control the passage of air from conduit 330 to
    the respective canisters.
                 In an embodiment, pressurized air is sent into one of canisters 302 or 304 while the other
 0  canister is being vented. For example, during use, inlet valve 122 is opened while inlet valve 124
    is closed. Pressurized air from compression system 200 is forced into canister 302, while being
    inhibited from entering canister 304 by inlet valve 124. During pressurization of canister 302,
    outlet valve 132 is closed and outlet valve 134 is opened.             Similar to the inlet valves, outlet
    valves 132 and 134 are operated out of phase with each other. Each inlet valve seat 322 includes
 5  an opening 375 that passes through housing 310 into canister 302.               Similarly valve seat 324
    includes an opening 325 that passes through housing 310 into canister 302. Air from conduit 330
    passes through openings 323, or 325 if the respective valve (322 or 324) is open, and enters a
    canister.
                 Check valves 142 and 144 (See, FIG. 4) are coupled to canisters 302 and 304,
 '0 respectively. Check valves 142 and 144 are one way valves that are passively operated by the
    pressure differentials that occur as the canisters are pressurized and vented. Oxygen enriched
    gas, produced in canisters 302 and 304 pass from the canister into openings 542 and 544 of
    housing 410.                A passage (not shown) links openings 542 and 544 to conduits 342 and 344,
    respectively.              Oxygen enriched gas produced in canister 302 passes from the canister though
25  opening 542 and into conduit 342 when the pressure in the canister is sufficient to open check
    valve 142.              When check valve 142 is open, oxygen enriched gas flows through conduit 342
    toward the end of housing 310. Similarly, oxygen enriched gas produced in canister 304 passes
    from the canister though opening 544 and into conduit 344 when the pressure in the canister is
    sufficient to open check valve 144. When check valve 144 is open, oxygen enriched gas flows
30  through conduit 344 toward the end of housing 310.
                 Oxygen enriched gas from either canister, travels through conduit 342 or 344 and enters
    conduit 346 formed in housing 310. Conduit 346 includes openings that couple the conduit to
    conduit 342, conduit 344 and accumulator 106. Thus oxygen enriched gas, produced in canister
    302 or 304, travels to conduit 346 and passes into accumulator 106.

                 After some time the gas separation adsorbent will become saturated with nitrogen and
    will be unable to separate significant amounts of nitrogen from incoming air. When the gas
    separation adsorbent in a canister reaches this saturation point, the inflow of compressed air is
    stopped and the canister is vented to remove nitrogen. Canister 302 is vented by closing inlet
 5  valve 122 and opening outlet valve 132. Outlet valve 132 releases the vented gas from canister
    302 into the volume defined by the end of housing 310. Foam material may cover the end of
    housing 310 to reduce the sound made by release of gases from the canisters. Similarly, canister
    304 is vented by closing inlet valve 124 and opening outlet valve 134. Outlet valve 134 releases
    the vented gas from canister 304 into the volume defined by the end of housing 310.
 0               While canister 302 is being vented, canister 304 is pressurized to produce oxygen
    enriched gas in the same manner described above. Pressurization of canister 304 is achieved by
    closing outlet valve 134 and opening inlet valve 124. The oxygen enriched gas exits canister 304
    through check valve 144.
                 In an exemplary embodiment, a portion of the oxygen enriched gas may be transferred
 5  from canister 302 to canister 304 when canister 304 is being vented of nitrogen. Transfer of
    oxygen enriched gas from canister 302 to canister 304, during venting of canister 304, helps to
    further purge nitrogen (and other gases) from the canister. Flow of oxygen enriched gas between
    the canisters is controlled using flow restrictors and valves, as depicted in FIG. 1. Three conduits
    are formed in housing 510 for use in transferring oxygen enriched gas between canisters. As
 '0 shown in FIG. 7, conduit 530 couples canister 302 to canister 304. Flow restrictor 151 (not
    shown) is disposed in conduit 530, between canister 302 and canister 304 to restrict flow of
    oxygen enriched gas during use. Conduit 532 also couples canister 302 to 304. Conduit 532 is
    coupled to valve seat 552 which receives valve 152, as shown in FIG. 8. Flow restrictor 153 (not
    shown) is disposed in conduit 532, between canister 302 and 304. Conduit 534 also couples
25  canister 302 to 304.               Conduit 534 is coupled to valve seat 554 which receives valve 154, as
    shown in FIG. 8. Flow restrictor 155 (not shown) is disposed in conduit 434, between canister
    302 and 304. The pair of equalization/vent valves 152/154 work with flow restrictors 153 and
    155 to optimize the air flow balance between the two canisters.
                 Oxygen enriched gas in accumulator 106 passes through supply valve 160 into expansion
30  chamber 170 which is formed in housing 510. An opening (not shown) in housing 510 couples
    accumulator 106 to supply valve 160. In an embodiment, expansion chamber may include one or
    more devices capable of being used to determine an oxygen concentration of gas passing through
    the chamber.
    Controller System

                 Operation of oxygen concentrator system 100 may be performed automatically using an
    internal controller 400 coupled to various components of the oxygen concentrator system, as
    described herein. Controller 400 includes one or more processors 410 and internal memory 420,
    as depicted in FIG. 1. Methods used to operate and monitor oxygen concentrator system 100
 5  may be implemented by program instructions stored in memory 420 or a carrier medium coupled
    to controller 400, and executed by one or more processors 410.           A non-transitory memory
    medium may include any of various types of memory devices or storage devices.              The term
    "memory medium" is intended to include an installation medium, e.g., a Compact Disc Read
    Only Memory (CD-ROM), floppy disks, or tape device; a computer system memory or random
 0  access memory such as Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM), Double Data Rate Random
    Access Memory (DDR RAM), Static Random Access Memory (SRAM), Extended Data Out
    Random Access Memory (EDO RAM), Rambus Random Access Memory (RAM), etc.; or a non
    volatile memory such as a magnetic media, e.g., a hard drive, or optical storage. The memory
    medium may comprise other types of memory as well, or combinations thereof. In addition, the
 5  memory medium may be located in a first computer in which the programs are executed, or may
    be located in a second different computer that connects to the first computer over a network, such
    as the Internet. In the latter instance, the second computer may provide program instructions to
    the first computer for execution. The term "memory medium" may include two or more memory
    mediums that may reside in different locations, e.g., in different computers that are connected
 '0 over a network.
                 In some embodiments, controller 400 includes processor 410 that includes, for example,
    one or more field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), microcontrollers, etc. included on a circuit
    board disposed in oxygen concentrator system 100. Processor 410 is capable of executing
    programming instructions stored in memory 420.              In some embodiments, programming
25  instructions may be built into processor 410 such that a memory external to the processor may
    not be separately accessed (i.e., the memory 420 may be internal to the processor 410).
                 Processor 410 may be coupled to various components of oxygen concentrator system 100,
    including, but not limited to compression system 200, one or more of the valves used to control
    fluid flow through the system (e.g., valves 122, 124, 132, 134, 152, 154, 160, or combinations
30  thereof), oxygen sensor 165, pressure sensor 194, flow rate monitor 180, temperature sensors,
    fans, and any other component that may be electrically controlled.        In some embodiments, a
    separate processor (and/or memory) may be coupled to one or more of the components.
                 Controller 400 is programmed to operate oxygen concentrator system 100 and is further
    programmed to monitor the oxygen concentrator system for malfunction states. For example, in
                                                      Page 21
    10222766_2 (GHMatters) P99796.AU.1

    one embodiment, controller 400 is programmed to trigger an alarm if the system is operating and
    no breathing is detected by the user for a predetermined amount of time.                 For example, if
    controller 400 does not detect a breath for a period of 75 seconds, an alarm LED may be lit
    and/or an audible alarm may be sounded. If the user has truly stopped breathing, for example,
 5  during a sleep apnea episode, the alarm may be sufficient to awaken the user, causing the user to
    resume breathing. The action of breathing may be sufficient for controller 400 to reset this alarm
    function. Alternatively, if the system is accidently left on when output conduit 192 is removed
    from the user, the alarm may serve as a reminder for the user to turn oxygen concentrator system
    100 off.
 0               Controller 400 is further coupled to oxygen sensor 165, and may be programmed for
    continuous or periodic monitoring of the oxygen concentration of the oxygen enriched gas
    passing through expansion chamber 170. A minimum oxygen concentration threshold may be
    programmed into controller 400, such that the controller lights an LED visual alarm and/or an
    audible alarm to warn the patient of the low concentration of oxygen.
 5               Controller 400 is also coupled to internal power supply 180 and is capable of monitoring
    the level of charge of the internal power supply. A minimum voltage and/or current threshold
    may be programmed into controller 400, such that the controller lights an LED visual alarm
    and/or an audible alarm to warn the patient of low power condition. The alarms may be activated
    intermittently and at an increasing frequency as the battery approaches zero usable charge.
 10              Further functions of controller 400 are described in detail in other sections of this
    disclosure.
                 A user may have a low breathing rate or depth if relatively inactive (e.g., asleep, sitting,
    etc.) as assessed by comparing the detected breathing rate or depth to a threshold. The user may
    have a high breathing rate or depth if relatively active (e.g., walking, exercising, etc.).           An
25  active/sleep mode may be assessed automatically and/or the user may manually indicate a
    respective active or sleep mode by a pressing button for active mode and another button for sleep
    mode. In some embodiments, a user may toggle a switch from active mode, normal mode, or
    sedentary mode.                    The adjustments made by the oxygen concentrator system in response to
    activating active mode or sleep mode are described in more detail herein.
30  Methods of Delivery of Oxygen Enriched Gas
                 The main use of an oxygen concentrator system is to provide supplemental oxygen to a
    user. Generally, the amount of supplemental oxygen to be provided is assessed by a physician.
    Typical prescribed amounts of supplemental oxygen may range from about 1 LPM to up to about
    10 LPM. The most commonly prescribed amounts are 1 LPM, 2 LPM, 3 LPM, and 4 LPM.
                                                             Page 22
    10222766_2 (GHMatters) P99796.AU.1

    Generally, oxygen enriched gas is provided to the use during a breathing cycle to meet the
    prescription requirement of the user. As used herein the term "breathing cycle" refers to an
    inhalation followed by an exhalation of a person.
                 In order to minimize the amount of oxygen enriched gas that is needed to be produced to
 5  meet the prescribed amounts, controller 400 may be programmed to time delivery of the oxygen
    enriched gas with the user's inhalations. Releasing the oxygen enriched gas to the user as the
    user inhales may prevent unnecessary oxygen generation (further reducing power requirements)
    by not releasing oxygen, for example, when the user is exhaling.            Reducing the amount of
    oxygen required may effectively reduce the amount of air compressing needed for oxygen
 0  concentrator 100 (and subsequently may reduce the power demand from the compressors).
                 Oxygen enriched gas, produced by oxygen concentrator system 100 is stored in an
    oxygen accumulator 106 and released to the user as the user inhales. The amount of oxygen
    enriched gas provided by the oxygen concentrator system is controlled, in part, by supply valve
    160. In an embodiment, supply valve 160 is opened for a sufficient amount of time to provide
 5  the appropriate amount of oxygen enriched gas, as assessed by controller 400, to the user. In
    order to minimize the amount of oxygen required to meet the prescription requirements of a user,
    the oxygen enriched gas may be provided in a bolus when a user's inhalation is first detected.
    For example, the bolus of oxygen enriched gas may be provided in the first few milliseconds of a
    user's inhalation.
 0O              In an embodiment, pressure sensor 194 and/or flow rate sensor 185 may be used to
    determine the onset of inhalation by the user. For example, the user's inhalation may be detected
    by using pressure sensor 194. In use, a conduit for providing oxygen enriched gas is coupled to a
    user's nose and/or mouth (e.g., using a nasal cannula or a face mask).           At the onset of an
    inhalation, the user begins to draw air into their body through the nose and/or mouth. As the air
25  is drawn in, a negative pressure is generated at the end of the conduit, due, in part, to the venturi
    action of the air being drawn across the end of the delivery conduit. Pressure sensor 194 may be
    operable to create a signal when a drop in pressure is detected, to signal the onset of inhalation.
    Upon detection of the onset of inhalation, supply valve 160 is controlled to release a bolus of
    oxygen enriched gas from the accumulator 106.
30               In some embodiments, pressure sensor 194 may provide a signal that is proportional to
    the amount of positive or negative pressure applied to a sensing surface. The amount of the
    pressure change detected by pressure sensor 194 may be used to refine the amount of oxygen
    enriched gas being provided to the user. For example, if a large negative pressure change is
    detected by pressure sensor 194, the volume of oxygen enriched gas provided to the user may be
                                                      Page 23
    10222766_2 (GHMatters) P99796.AU.1

    increased to take into account the increased volume of gas being inhaled by the user. If a smaller
    negative pressure is detected, the volume of oxygen enriched gas provided to the user may be
    decreased to take into account the decreased volume of gas being inhaled by the user. A positive
    change in the pressure indicates an exhalation by the user and is generally a time that release of
 5  oxygen enriched gas is discontinued. Generally while a positive pressure change is sensed, valve
    160 remains closed until the next onset of inhalation.
                 In some embodiments, the sensitivity of the pressure sensor 194 may be affected by the
    physical distance of the pressure sensor 194 from the user, especially if the pressure sensor is
    located in oxygen concentrator system 100 and the pressure difference is detected through the
 0  tubing coupling the oxygen concentrator system to the user. In some embodiments, the pressure
    sensor may be placed in the airway delivery device used to provide the oxygen enriched gas to
    the user. A signal from the pressure sensor may be provided to controller 400 in the oxygen
    concentrator 100 electronically via a wire or through telemetry such as through BLUETOOTH@
    (Bluetooth, SIG, Inc. Kirkland, Washington) or other wireless technology.
 5               In an embodiment, the user's inhalation may be detected by using flow rate sensor 185.
    In use, a conduit for providing oxygen enriched gas is coupled to a user's nose and/or mouth
    (e.g., using a nasal cannula or face mask). At the onset of an inhalation, the user begins to draw
    air into their body through the nose and/or mouth. As the air is drawn in, an increase in flow of
    gas passing through conduit is created. Flow rate sensor 185 may be operable to create a signal
 '0 when an increase in flow rate is detected, to signal the onset of inhalation. Upon detection of the
    onset of inhalation, supply valve 160 is controlled to release a bolus of oxygen enriched gas from
    the accumulator 106.
                 A user breathing at a rate of 30 breaths per minute (BPM) during an active state (e.g.,
    walking, exercising, etc.) may consume two and one-half times as much oxygen as a user who is
25  breathing at 12 BPM during a sedentary state (e.g., asleep, sitting, etc.). Pressure sensor 194
    and/or flow rate sensor 185 may be used to determine the breathing rate of the user. Controller
    400 may process information received from pressure sensor 194 and/or flow rate sensor 185 and
    determine a breathing rate based on the frequency of the onset of inhalation.         The detected
    breathing rate of the user may be used to adjust the bolus of oxygen enriched gas. The volume of
30  the bolus of oxygen enriched gas may be increased as the users breathing rate increase, and may
    be decreased as the users breathing rate decreases. Controller 400 may automatically adjust the
    bolus based on the detected activity state of the user. Alternatively, the user may manually
    indicate a respective active or sedentary mode by selecting the appropriate option on the control
    panel of the oxygen concentrator. Alternatively, a user may operate controller 400 from a remote
                                                       Page 24
    10222766_2 (GHMatters) P99796.AU.1

    electronic device. For example, a user may operate the controller using a smart phone or tablet
    device.
                 In some embodiments, if the user's current activity level as assessed using the detected
    user's breathing rate exceeds a predetermined threshold, controller 400 may implement an alarm
 5  (e.g., visual and/or audio) to warn the user that the current breathing rate is exceeding the
    delivery capacity of the oxygen concentrator system. For example, the threshold may be set at 20
    breaths per minute.
                 In some embodiments, controller 400 may operate the oxygen concentrator based on the
    change in the inspiration breath pressure threshold. The frequency and/or duration of the
 0  provided oxygen enriched gas to the user relative to the current frequency and/or duration may be
    adjusted based on the change in the inspiration breath pressure threshold. Upon determining that
    the inspiration breath pressure threshold has been lowered, the controller 400 may switch the
    oxygen concentrator to a sedentary mode. Controller 400 may switch the oxygen concentrator to
    an active mode, when the inspiration breath pressure threshold has been raised.
 5               In some embodiments, as seen in FIG. 9, the bolus of provided oxygen enriched gas may
    include two or more pulses. For example, with a one liter per minute (LPM) delivery rate, the
    bolus may include two pulses: a first pulse 556 at approximately 7 cubic centimeters and a
    second pulse 558 at approximately 3 cubic centimeters. Other delivery rates, pulse sizes, and
    number of pulses are also contemplated.          For example, at 2 LPMs, the first pulse may be
 '0 approximately 14 cubic centimeters and a second pulse may be approximately 6 cubic
    centimeters and at 3 LPMs, the first pulse may be approximately 21 cubic centimeters and a
    second pulse may be approximately 9 cubic centimeters. In some embodiments, the larger pulse
    556 may be provided when the onset of inhalation is detected (e.g., detected by pressure sensor
    194). In some embodiments, the pulses may be provided when the onset of inhalation is detected
25  and/or may be spread time-wise evenly through the breath. In some embodiments, the pulses
    may be stair-stepped through the duration of the breath. In some embodiments, the pulses may
    be distributed in a different pattern. Additional pulses may also be used (e.g., 3, 4, 5, etc. pulses
    per breath). While the first pulse 556 is shown to be approximately twice the second pulse 558,
    in some embodiments, the second pulse 558 may be larger than the first pulse 556. In some
30  embodiments, pulse size and length may be controlled by, for example, supply valve 160 which
    may open and close in a timed sequence to provide the pulses. A bolus with multiple pulses may
    have a smaller impact on a user than a bolus with a single pulse. The multiple pulses may also
    result in less drying of a user's nasal passages and less blood oxygen desaturation. The multiple
    pulses may also result in less oxygen waste.
                                                     Page 25
    10222766_2 (GHMatters) P99796.AU.1

                In some embodiments, the sensitivity of the oxygen concentrator 100 may be selectively
   attenuated to reduce false inhalation detections due to movement of air from a different source
   (e.g., movement of ambient air).         For example, the oxygen concentrator 100 may have two
   selectable modes - an active mode and an inactive mode. In some embodiments, the user may
 5 manually select a mode (e.g., through a switch or user interface).         In some embodiments, the
   mode may be automatically selected by the oxygen concentrator 100 based on a detected
   breathing rate. For example, the oxygen concentrator 100 may use the pressure sensor 194 to
   detect a breathing rate of the user.        If the breathing rate is above a threshold, the oxygen
   concentrator 100 may operate in an active mode (otherwise, the oxygen concentrator may operate
 0 in an inactive mode). Other modes and thresholds are also contemplated.
                In some embodiments, in active mode, the sensitivity of the pressure sensor 194 may be
   mechanically, electronically, or programmatically attenuated. For example, during active mode,
   controller 400 may look for a greater pressure difference to indicate the start of a user breath
   (e.g., an elevated threshold may be compared to the detected pressure difference to determine if
 5 the bolus of oxygen should be released). In some embodiments, the pressure sensor 194 may be
   mechanically altered to be less sensitive to pressure differences.         In some embodiments, an
   electronic signal from the pressure sensor may be electronically altered to ignore small pressure
   differences. This can be useful when in active mode. In some embodiments, during the inactive
   mode the sensitivity of the pressure sensor may be increased. For example, the controller 400
 O may look for a smaller pressure difference to indicate the start of a user breath (e.g., a smaller
   threshold may be compared to the detected pressure difference to determine if the bolus of
   oxygen should be released). In some embodiments, with increased sensitivity, the response time
   for providing the bolus of oxygen during the user's inhalation may be reduced. The increased
   sensitivity and smaller response time may reduce the size of the bolus necessary for a given flow
25 rate equivalence. The reduced bolus size may also reduce the size and power consumption of the
   oxygen concentrator 100.
   Providing a Bolus Based on Inhalation Profile
                In an embodiment, the bolus profile can be designed to match the profile of a particular
   user. To do so, an inhalation profile may be generated based on information gathered from
30 pressure sensor 194 and flow rate sensor 185. An inhalation profile is assessed based on, one or
   more of the following parameters: the breathing rate of the user; the inhalation volume of the
   user; the exhalation volume of the user; the inhalation flow rate of the user; and the exhalation
   flow rate of the user. The breathing rate of the user may be assessed by detecting the onset of
   inhalation using pressure sensor 194 or flow rate sensor 185 as previously discussed. Inhalation
                                                      Page 26
   10222766_2 (GHMatters) P99796.AU.1

    volume may be assessed by measuring the change in pressure during inhalation and calculating
    or empirically assessing the inhalation volume based on the change in pressure. Alternatively,
    inhalation volume may be assessed by measuring the flow rate during inhalation and calculating
    or empirically assessing the inhalation volume based on the flow rate and the length of the
 5  inhalation. Exhalation volume may be assessed in a similar manner using either positive pressure
    changes during exhalation, or flow rate and exhalation time. Inhalation flow rate of the user is
    measured from shortly after the onset of inhalation. Detection of the end of inhalation may be
    from the pressure sensor or the flow rate sensor. When onset of inhalation is detected by the
    pressure sensor, the onset is characterized by a drop in pressure. When the pressure begins to
 0  increase, the inhalation is considered complete. When onset of inhalation is detected by the flow
    rate sensor, the onset is characterized by an increase in the flow rate. When the flow rate begins
    to decrease, the inhalation is considered complete.
                 There is a minimum amount of oxygen necessary for a person to remain conscious. A
    person who is breathing rapidly is bringing in a lower volume of air in each breath, and thus,
 5  requires less oxygen enriched gas per inhalation. While there is some variation from patient to
    patient, this relationship can be used to establish the mean flow rate for each breath
    mathematically. By measuring a large population of patients, the profile of the relative flow
    from onset of inhalation to the onset of exhalation may be established. Using this flow profile as
    a template, the calculated actual flow based on breathing rate can be adjusted mathematically to a
 '0 calculated actual flow profile. This profile can be used to adjust the opening and closing of the
    delivery valve to create an idealized profile for the patient based on their breathing rate.
    Inhalation profile data gathered from a population of users may be used to create an algorithm
    that makes the appropriate adjustments based on the detected inhalation profile. Alternatively, a
    look up table may be used to control valve actuation durations and pulse quantities based on a
25  detected inhalation profile.
                 Measuring the inhalation profile of the patient provides a more accurate basis for control
    of the bolus of oxygen enriched gas being provided to the patient. For example, basing the
    delivery of oxygen enriched gas on the onset of inhalation may not take into account differences
    between individual users. For example, people having a similar breathing rate can have different
30  inhalation/exhalation volume, inhalation/exhalation flow rates and, thus, different bolus
    requirements necessary to produce the prescribed amount of oxygen. In one embodiment, an
    inhalation profile is created based on the flow rate of air during inhalation and the duration of
    inhalation. The inhalation profile can then be used as a predictor of the volume of air taken in by
    a specific user during inhalation. Thus, inhalation profile information can be used to modify the
                                                        Page 27
    10222766_2 (GHMatters) P99796.AU.1

   amount of oxygen enriched air provided to the user to ensure that the prescribed level of oxygen
   is received. The amount of oxygen provided to a user may be adjusted by modifying the
   frequency and or duration of release of oxygen enriched gas from the accumulator with supply
   valve 160. By tracking the inhalation profile of the patient controller adjusts the delivery supply
 5 valve actuation to idealize the bolus profile to provide the oxygen at the maximum rate without
   causing wasteful retrograde flow.
   Power Management
                Power for operation of oxygen concentrator system is provided by an internal power
   supply 180.               Having an internal power supply allows portable use of the oxygen concentrator
 0 system. In one embodiment, internal power supply 180 includes a lithium ion battery. Lithium
   ion batteries offer advantages over other rechargeable batteries by being able to provide more
   power by weight than many other batteries.
                In one embodiment, the compression system, valves, cooling fans and controller may all
   be powered by an internal power supply. Controller 400 (depicted schematically in FIG. 1)
 5 measures the actual output voltage of the internal power supply and adjusts the voltage to the
   various subsystems to the appropriate level though dedicated circuits on a printed circuit board
   positioned inside the oxygen concentrator.
                In one embodiment, controller 400 adjusts the operation of compressors 305 and 310
   based on the oxygen output needs of the user.                  Controller 400 may assess a preselected
 O prescription for the oxygen concentrator.               In the embodiments shown herein, the oxygen
   concentrator has a switch which is set by the user or the prescribing doctor at the proper
   prescription rate (1 LPM up to 5 LPM). Controller 400 can assess the position of the switch to
   determine the prescription for the subject. Based on the prescription of the subject, the controller
   causes one or more of the compressors to operate to begin production of oxygen.
25              In many instances, the operation energy of the oxygen concentrator can be optimized by
   operating the compressors at less than their normal maximum compressor speed. As used herein,
   the phrase "normal maximum compressor speed" means the speed that the compressor runs when
   the compressor is supplied with a current and voltage that corresponds with the manufacturer's
   highest listed current and voltage for proper operation of the compressor.
30              At low prescription rates (e.g., 1 LPM) it may not be necessary to run both compressors
   to produce enough oxygen for the user. In some instances, it may not be necessary to run the
   compressor(s) at the normal maximum compressor speed. Controller 400 may be programmed to
   control the operation of one or more compressors at a percentage of the normal maximum
   compressor speed, wherein the percentage is assessed based on the preselected prescription. In
                                                          Page 28
   10222766_2 (GHMatters) P99796.AU.1

    some instance, the selected percentage is percentage less than 100%. If the prescription setting
    for the oxygen concentrator is changed, controller 400 may adjust the compressor speed to a
    different percentage of the normal maximum compressor speed based on changes in the
    prescription and/or the breathing rate of the user.
 5               Controller 400 may further assess the breathing rate of the subject.      When providing
    oxygen to the user, the amount of oxygen needed to maintain the proper prescription is based on
    the breathing rate of the user. When the user has a low breathing rate (e.g., 15 breaths per minute
    ("bpm") or less) then the compressor may operate at a first percentage of the normal maximum
    compressor speed. If the users breathing rate increases, it may be necessary for the compressor
 0  to be operated at a second percentage of the normal maximum compressor speed, which is
    different from the first percentage.           In this situation the second percentage will be a higher
    percentage than the first percentage.
                 When only one compressor is being used, the controller may arbitrarily select which
    compressor is operated.            The selection of the compressor may be randomized or alternated, to
 5  avoid using one compressor more than the other compressor(s). This will help extend the life of
    the compressors.
                 At high prescriptions, (e.g., 3 LPM or more) it may be necessary to run more than one
    compressor at the same time to provide sufficient oxygen for the user.              When two or more
    compressors are operated at the same time, each of the compressors may be operated at a
 '0 percentage less than the normal maximum compressor speed. If the breathing rate of the user
    increases, the speed of each compressor may also be increased.               In some embodiments, the
    compressors may not be capable of moving enough air to produce sufficient oxygen for the
    patient when operating at 100% of the normal maximum compressor speed. Controller 400 may
    be capable of sending a voltage and or current to one or more of the compressors that is above
25  the manufacturer's highest listed current and voltage for proper operation of the compressor.
    This will cause the compressor(s) to run at a speed above the normal maximum compressor
    speed. This allows the controller to maintain proper oxygen delivery to the patient, even when
    the patient's oxygen needs exceed the normal operating parameters of the oxygen concentrator.
                 In some embodiments, only one compressor may be used to produce the oxygen needed
30  by the patient. The compressor may be operated at a speed that is less than the normal maximum
    compressor speed. If the activity level of the patient increases the controller may increase the
    speed of the compressor to increase the production of oxygen. As the speed of the compressor
    approaches 100% of the normal maximum compressor speed, the controller may start a second
    compressor before the first compressor reaches 100% of the normal maximum compressor speed.
                                                          Page 29
    10222766_2 (GHMatters) P99796.AU.1

    Both compressors may be operated at the same speed, or different speeds. Both compressors
    may be operated at a speed that is less than the normal maximum compressor speed. The first
    compressor and the second compressor may be operated at the same percentage of the normal
    compressor speed.
 5               In an exemplary embodiment, an oxygen concentrator has two compressors.             At a
    prescription of 1 LPM, a single compressor is operated at about 65% of the normal maximum
    compressor speed to provide oxygen to the user, if the breathing rate is at about 12-15 bpm. The
    compressor that is operated is arbitrarily selected by the controller. If the breathing rate of the
    subject increases above 15 bpm, the compressor speed may be increased to compensate for the
 0  increased breathing rate.          In this example, the compressor speed remains below 100% of the
    normal maximum compressor speed at any given breathing rate.
                 In the same exemplary system, if the prescription is increased to 2 LPM, a single
    compressor is operated at about 75% of the normal maximum compressor speed, to provide
    oxygen to the user, if the breathing rate is at about 12-15 bpm. If the breathing rate of the user
 5  increases above 15 bpm, the compressor speed is increased up until the speed of the compressor
    reaches 85% of the normal maximum compressor speed. At this point the controller turns on the
    second compressor, and adjust the speed of both compressors, so that both compressors operate
    at about 65% of the normal maximum compressor speed.
                 In the same exemplary system, if the prescription is increased to 3 LPM, both
 '0 compressors are operated at about 85% of the normal maximum compressor speed, to provide
    oxygen to the user, if the breathing rate is at about 12-15 bpm. If the breathing rate of the user
    increases above 15 bpm, the speed of both compressors is increased.              If the breathing rate
    approaches 25 bpm, the compressors may not be able to provide sufficient oxygen when operated
    at the normal maximum compressor speed.                To provide the proper amount of oxygen to the
25  patient, each compressor may be operated at a speed that is greater than the normal maximum
    compressor speed. Since breathing rates at or above 25 bpm are typically not maintained for
    long periods of time by the user, the overdriving of the compressors is typically not performed
    for long.
                 This method of controlling the compressors was shown to improve the battery life of the
30  oxygen concentrator. In a prior set up, when the compressors were operated at a single speed, the
    battery life for the oxygen concentrator was about 2 hours. When the same system was updated
    using the control method described above, the battery life was increased to 9 hours.
    Canisters

                When using a gas separation adsorbent, oxygen is separated from air by adsorption of
   molecules other than oxygen onto the gas separation adsorbent. The adsorption process may be
   enhanced by the choice of the gas separation adsorbent and/or by the design of the canister that
   contains the gas separation adsorbent. Oxygen concentrator apparatus 100 may include canisters
 5 containing gas separation adsorbent that are designed to produce a steady gas flow (laminar gas
   flow) or substantially steady gas flow. The canister may be an elongated tube (for example,
   cylindrical) with a diameter of a first end of the canister being larger than the diameter of the
   second end of the canister. For example, the canister may be tapered outwardly at the exit end of
   the canister. Such a canister design, when filled with gas separation adsorbent (for example,
 0 zeolite), may produce a gas flow having a Reynolds number ranging from about 10 to about 20 or
   from about 10 to about 18. FIG. 10 depicts an embodiment of a tapered canister. Canister 600
   may include first end 602 and second end 604. As shown first end 602 has a larger diameter than
   second end 604. Side walls of canister 600 form first end 602 toward second end 604.
                In some embodiments, the canister may include baffles. One or more baffles may be
 5 positioned along the inner wall of the canister at a desired angle relative to the side wall. For
   example, the baffles may be at about a 90 degree angle relative to the side wall. FIG. 11 A
   depicts an embodiment of canister 606 with baffles 608. Canister 606 may have the same size
   and dimension as canisters 302 and 304. FIG. 11 B depicts an embodiment of tapered canister
   600 with baffles 608. FIG. 1 IC depicts a top view of an embodiment of canisters 600, 606 with
 0 baffles 608. The baffles 608 may be placed at an angle to the canister 600 (or canister 606) axis
   in a sequential arrangement to create a helical flow pattern.         Helical gas flow may enhance
   thermal effectiveness and heat transfer without significant pressure drop.           Vibration of the
   canister may be lowered when helical flow pattern is used relative to a pressure drop of a canister
   without baffles. In some embodiments, the baffles may include holes. The inclusion of baffles
25 in a tapered canister may create of vortex of air flow in the canister. Creating a vortex in the
   canister may reduce weight per LPM of the device as well as minimize the dead space. This may
   allow the canister to achieve greater efficacy of conversion with a smaller volume.
                In some embodiments, a canister is made from one or more polymers, one or more
   nonmetals, one or more metal compounds, or mixtures thereof. Examples of polymers include

   like. Examples, of nonmetals include, glass, fused silica, glass fiber, or the like. Examples of
   metal compounds include aluminum, nickel, copper, metal alloys, or the like.                 In some
   embodiments, a canister may be made from polyamides, glass fiber, aluminum or mixtures
   thereof. For example, the canister may be made of about 60% polyamide and about 40% glass,

    about 70% polyamide and about 40% glass, or about 80% polyamide and about 20% glass. The
    canister may include a thin coating of a metal or metal alloy on the inner and/or outer surface of
    the canister.               Films may be deposited on the surface of the canister using physical vapor
    deposition methods or other methods known in the art to deposit films. An example of physical
 5  vapor deposition is sputtering. Using a thin coat of metal or metal alloy may allow fabrication of
    a light weight canister that does not collapse under pressure. In some embodiments, the canisters
    are manufactured from materials that all the canister to be disposable.
    Ionized Air
                 Due to the size of the canister in the oxygen concentrator, the quantity of gas separation
 0  adsorbent is small, but is capable of producing an adequate quantity of product gas. Since the
    gas separation adsorbent is optimized for maximum performance for a specific oxygen
    concentrator (for example, the canister), any significant decrease in capacity of the gas separation
    adsorbent over time results in decreased product purity. One contributing factor that may lead to
    a decrease in bed capacity is the adsorption of impurities that do not completely desorb during
 5  normal process operation, leading to the accumulation and retention of impurities in the gas
    separation adsorbent. An example of such an impurity that reduces the adsorption capacity of
    many zeolites used in air separation is water.
                  Some stationary concentrators utilize some means of removing water from the
    compressed gas before feeding the gas separation adsorbent.                  Portable concentrators, by the
 '0 nature of their application, are more likely to be exposed to a wide range of operating conditions
    including high humidity environments and/or rapid temperature changes that could result in the
    need for more sophisticated water rejection capabilities than implemented in conventional
    portable oxygen concentrators.             If water is present, either in the form of liquid or vapor, and
    enters the gas separation adsorbent, the gas adsorbent may adsorb at least some of the water
25  during each adsorption cycle.
                 When zeolites are used as the gas separation adsorbent, the energy of adsorption of water
    is high relative to other types of adsorbent. During the gas separation process not all adsorbed
    water may be desorbed during evacuation/purge of the beds under typical cycling. Therefore,
    complete removal of adsorbed water from gas separation adsorbent usually entails applying some
30  sort of energy to the beds, such as thermal, infrared, or microwave, and purging with a dry gas or
    applying a vacuum to the beds during the regeneration process.
                 Although highly effective air drying systems exist in other types of gas separation
    adsorbent fields, most of these systems consume power, increase size and weight, or reduce
    system efficiency in a manner detrimental to the stringent power consumption, size/weight, and
                                                            Page 32

    acoustic noise level requirements of portable concentrators.               Using a single process gas
    separation adsorbent with some portion of the gas separation adsorbent dedicated to impurity
    processing/rejection is a common method of adding impurity rejection to a gas separation system.
    Adding canisters containing gas separation adsorbent dedicated to dehydration of the feed stream
 5  upstream of the gas separation adsorbent or implementing layered absorbent utilizing desiccants
    in addition to gas adsorbent suited for the desired gas fractionation are also common methods of
    adding water rejection capacity to a gas separation system, and can be effective in many
    circumstances. However, additional canisters add significant size and weight to the concentrator,
    or in the case of layered absorbents, the desiccant layer displaces volume that could otherwise be
 0  used for adsorbent used for highly efficient air separation or the volume of the process columns
    could be decreased accordingly, and additional power is used to compress gas through the
    desiccant.
                 Desiccants typically used for pre-drying air are also prone to deactivation during constant
    cycling as well as during shutdown periods, and are often regenerated via applying one of the
 5  aforementioned methods. In some cases, the desiccant layer may be advantageous, but also might
    not be entirely effective at protecting the specialized adsorbents from water damage. By their
    nature, personal oxygen concentrators, be they portable or stationary, often operate in varied
    usage modalities rather than in the continuous duty manner of an industrial gas production plant.
    The duty cycle, storage time between use, and storage environment, can vary widely from unit to
 '0 unit. For example, home health care providers may have a fleet of units that are stored in
    warehouses that are not climate controlled while waiting for delivery to patients for use.
    Similarly, patients may store units in their car or home for a given period of time without use
    depending on their individual oxygen needs.            Thus, care must be used in shutting down and
    storing units containing gas separation adsorbent that are run on an intermittent basis. Any water
25  (or other impurities) remaining in the desiccant layer(s) or portion of the gas separation adsorbent
    used for feed gas drying upon shutdown will diffuse over time due to the gradient in chemical
    potential between the portion of the bed that is used for impurity removal during normal
    operation and the dry portion of the beds.
                 The diffusion coefficient of water in zeolites has Arrhenius type temperature dependence,
30  so if a concentrator is stored in a high temperature environment the rate of intraparticle diffusion
    will increase exponentially with temperature.          The gas phase diffusion rate will increase with
    increasing temperature as well. Thus, in an oxygen concentrator system it is advantageous to
    remove as much water as possible from the compressed gas feed stream to prevent deactivation
    of the highly efficient zeolite, use less desiccant, and minimize the presence of water in the gas
                                                        Page 33

   separation adsorbent during shutdown. Traditional means of removing water such as coalescing
   filters and gravity water traps have limited abilities to remove water and can thereby limit the
   usable service life of oxygen concentrating equipment. The varying operating and storage
   environments that portable concentrators may be exposed to result in design challenges that more
 5 conventional gas separation systems such as gas separation plants might not encounter and must
   be addressed. As described, more efficient removal of water and/or other impurities from gas
   separation adsorbent is desired.
                Gas separation adsorbent (for example, zeolites) may have two or more layers that
   include charged layers. A first layer may include positively charged particles, and a second layer
 0 may include negatively charged particles dispersed on top of the negatively charged particles, or
   vise versa. The negatively charged particles may be evenly or unevenly dispersed on the first
   layer. For example, water molecules may be electrostatically bound to protons or metal cations
   in the zeolite. Applying current to the gas separation adsorbent or providing charged air to the
   gas separation adsorbent may change or disturb the electrostatic charge. For example, the Gouy
 5 Chapman model of electrical double layer may be applied to the canisters. Disruption of the
   electrostatic charge may release the water from the gas separation adsorbent. The water may be
   vented from the canister.              Removal of a sufficient amount of water may recharge the gas
   separation adsorbent. Thus, the gas separation adsorbent may be reused. Such treatment of a gas
   separation adsorbent may extend the life of the gas separation adsorbent and provide economical
 O gas separation adsorbents with good reliability.
                In some embodiments, oxygen concentrator apparatus 100 may include a canister
   containing gas separation adsorbent, at least two electrodes and a power supply. FIG. 12 depicts
   a perspective view of an embodiment of a canister that includes at least two electrodes 610, 610'
   in canister 612. FIG. 13 depicts a top view of the canister of FIG. 12 containing gas separation
25 adsorbent 618. FIG. 14 depicts an embodiment of a canister that includes at least two electrodes
   610, 610' on the outer surface of canister 612. Electrodes 610, 610' are connected to power
   supply 614 by cables 616. Power supply 614 may be a separate power supply (for example, an
   external power supply or a wall plug) or the same power supply (for example, a battery) for the
   oxygen concentrator.               Power supply 614 may provide alternating current or direct current to
30 electrodes 610, 610'. In some embodiments, power supply may include a power switch to turn
   the power supply on and off.
                Electrodes 610, 610' may be flat, cylindrical or any suitable shape. As shown in FIG. 14,
   electrodes 610, 610' are positioned on an outer portion of canister 612. In some embodiments,
   electrodes 610, 610' are positioned between an inner wall and an outer wall of canister 612.

    Electrodes 610, 610' may be made of materials known to be suitable for the ionization of air.
    Suitable materials include, but are not limited to, platinum, copper, nickel, doped ceramic
    materials or the like. In some embodiments, electrodes 610, 610' are a single unit that includes
    electrolyte material between the two electrodes.
 5               In some embodiments, electrodes 610, 610' are removably coupled to the canister. Using
    electrodes 610, 610' (and electrode power supply) that are removably coupled to the canister
    allows the electrodes to be removed after the gas separation adsorbent is recharged. Thus, the
    extra weight of the power supply and/or electrodes is not added to the weight of the portable
    oxygen concentrator.
 0                Supply of power to one of the electrodes, electrically excites the electrode such that
    current flows between the two electrodes. The current may ionize air flowing between the two
    electrodes. The ionized air may contact the gas separation adsorbent and ionize water absorbed
    in the gas separation adsorbent. In some embodiments, contact of the ionized air with bacteria
    absorbed on the gas separation adsorbent may kill some or all of the bacteria present. In some
 5  embodiments, current flowing between electrodes 610, 610' may produce sufficient heat to
    desorb water from the gas separation adsorbent and/or kill bacteria in the gas separation
    adsorbent. Removal of water and/or bacteria from the gas separation adsorbent may sufficiently
    recharge the gas separation adsorbent for continued use.
    Thermal Shutdown
 10              During use of an oxygen concentrator system, there are many sources of heat that may
    cause the temperature of the unit to become elevated.                As the temperature of the oxygen
    concentrator system increases, the components will begin to operate less efficiently. Eventually,
    if the oxygen concentrator system becomes too hot, some components may become permanently
    damage, requiring extensive repairs to place the system back into service. In one embodiment,
25  one or more temperature sensors are placed within the body of an oxygen concentrator system.
    Temperature sensors may be coupled to a controller of the oxygen concentrator system which
    monitors the internal temperature of the system. If the sensed internal temperature of the oxygen
    concentrator system exceeds a predetermined threshold, the controller may provide signals that
    cause the system to shut down until the temperature of the system drops below a predetermined
30  temperature.                For example, a controller may initiate a shutdown sequence if the internal
    temperature of an oxygen concentrator system exceeds 60'C. The oxygen concentrator system
    may be kept in a shutdown state until the internal temperature of the system falls below 55'C.
    Autopulse Diagnostic Mode
                                                           Page 35
    10222766_2 (GHMatters) P99796.AU.1

                For diagnostic purposes, it may be desirable to check the operation of an oxygen
   concentrator system by triggering release of the oxygen enriched gas produced by the system.
   During normal operation, the release of oxygen enriched gas is triggered by a sensed inhalation
   by the user. For diagnostic testing, it is desirable to be able to trigger the release of oxygen
 5 enriched gas produced by an oxygen concentrator system, to test for purity and accuracy of the
   volume of gas released.             In one embodiment, an autopulse mode may be programmed into a
   controller of an oxygen concentrator system. Autopulse mode may be used to release oxygen
   enriched gas produced by the oxygen concentrator system without the need to detect an
   inhalation of a user.              In autopulse mode, the controller may provide signals to oxygen
 0 concentrator system to release oxygen enriched gas according to predetermined rates.              For
   example, in autopulse mode, the controller may produce pulses of oxygen enriched gas
   corresponding to breathing rates of 10 bpm, 15 bpm, 20 bpm, 25 bpm, and 30 bpm.                 Other
   breathing rates may also be simulated in autopulse mode. In this manner, the operation of the
   components may be assessed to see if the device is functionally properly.
 5 Off-Time
                When a portable oxygen concentrator, stationary oxygen concentrator, or a hybrid oxygen
   concentrator is not being used (for example, when the unit is turned off, being shipped, stored, or
   the like), the gas separation adsorbent may be detrimentally effected and/or deactivated, and thus,
   the life of the device (gas separation adsorbent) may be effected. For example, when the oxygen
 0 concentrator is turned off, pressure in the canister is released. Wet air may be drawn into the
   canister and be absorbed by the gas separation adsorbent. For example, a device may lose up to
   50% of the mean time between failure when the machine is turned off for an extended period of
   time. Conditioning the device and/or gas separation adsorbent when the oxygen concentrator is
   in "off time" may extend the life of the device. In some embodiments, the canisters containing
25 gas separation adsorbent may conditioned by storing the gas separation adsorbent or the canister
   containing the gas separation adsorbent under pressure. For example, the canisters may be
   pressurized at stored at a pressure ranging from about 5 psi to above 10 psi.
                The controller may monitor and/or assess the pressure of the oxygen concentrator
   canisters when the canisters are not being used. In a hybrid system, the controller may monitor
30 and determine the pressure of the stationary oxygen concentrator system canisters while the
   portable oxygen concentrator is being used or vice versa. When the pressure drops below a
   specified pressure (for example, below 10 psi, below 8 psi, or below 5 psi), the controller will
   start the compression system (wake-up the machine), and pressurize the canister to the desired
   pressure. In some embodiments, the canister is pressurized by providing compressed air that has
                                                        Page 36
   10222766_2 (GHMatters) P99796.AU.1

    been passed through an adsorbent that dries the water from the air prior to entering the canister.
    After the canister is pressurized to the desired pressure, the controller will turn the oxygen
    concentrator off.
                 In some embodiments, program instructions in processor 420 of controller 400 are
 5  operable to perform various predefined methods that are used to monitor the pressure of the
    oxygen concentrator when the oxygen concentrator is in an off state. The controller may
    automatically assess a state of the oxygen concentrator. For example, the state of the oxygen
    concentrator may be off or on. Based on the assessed state, the controller may assess a pressure
    of one or more of the canister. The current pressure of the canister may be stored in memory.
 0  The assessed pressure may be determined to be low or normal. For example, the assessed
    pressure may be compared to a defined pressure range. The defined pressure range may be in a
    look-up table. In some embodiments, a low or normal pressure is determined using an algorithm.
                 When the pressure is determined to be low, the controller turns on the compression
    system and the canister is pressurized to the desired pressure. The speed of the compressor may
 5  be adjusted based on the desired pressure and/or the assessed pressure. The controller may
    continue to monitor the pressure of the canister and when the canister pressure is at the desired
    pressure, the compression system is turn off. Such monitoring of the canister pressures and
    pressurizing the canisters as needed during an off time extends the life of the gas separation
    adsorbent.
 '0 Adsorbent Life Compensation
                 In some embodiments, the life of the gas separation adsorbent may be extended by
    adjusting the operation of the compressor. During use, the gas separation adsorbent of an oxygen
    concentrator system will acquire moisture from the air that is contacted with the adsorbent. The
    moisture in the air reduces the amount of nitrogen that the gas separation adsorbent can remove
25  from the air. When the unit no longer produces oxygen enriched gas having a purity above 85%,
    the gas separation adsorbent typically needs to be replaced. In an embodiment, a controller of an
    oxygen concentrator system monitors the oxygen purity and, as it becomes lowers over time, the
    compressor system is adjusted to provide higher pressure compressed air to the canisters.
    Generally, gas separation adsorbents will adsorb more nitrogen as the pressure inside the
30  canisters is increased. By operating the compressors at a faster speed, the pressure inside the
    canisters will increase, leading to higher purity oxygen enriched gas. Operating the compressors
    at a higher speed will reduce the run time of a battery powered oxygen concentration system, but
    will allow the user to extend the life of the gas separation adsorbent until the adsorbent is
    replaced. Oxygen sensors (previously described) are used to assess the purity of the oxygen
                                                      Page 37
    10222766_2 (GHMatters) P99796.AU.1

    enriched gas and a controller may alter the operating speed of the compressors to extend the
    useable life of the gas separation adsorbent.
